","""the bad stuff is easier to believe. you ever notice that?"" - vivian<br/><br/>ok, so pretty woman is a romantic movie, its cliched, its corny, its sappy. but hey, beyond all that is a special movie with some very special performances. julia roberts as vivian ward is absolutely adorable, one of the most lovable characters of alltime. and those long legs help - like she says - "" 88"" of therapy for the bargain price of $3000""<br/><br/>the movie has many memorable lines and if you fall in love with the movie you will go back to it again and again. this is easily the best romantic comedy movie of the 90s. though many movies have hence tried to recreate its charm, nothing has quite succeeded to replace this movie as the pinnacle of the genre.<br/><br/>and this ofcourse is high praise from someone who hates the genre. the story ofcourse is very predictable and cinderella like. however this is beautifully told and the on-screen chemistry between the very dashing richard gere and julia roberts is simply sensational. an absolute must for fans of romance, comedy, any kind of light hearted movies or for those who are big fans of julia or richard. watch this movie.<br/><br/>an enjoyable 8!"
"tfrizzell","Null","64","83","25 August 2003"," The Last Gasp for 1980s Style Flair.
","Pure Hollywood fluff story that is so smart and sports such a dynamite cast that it becomes one of the more wonderful films of the period. ""Pretty Woman"" is pop culture at its finest as Julia Roberts (in an Oscar-nominated, icon-making role) is a prostitute on the mean streets of Los Angeles who gets a big financial break one night when she meets up with cold, but lonely business guru Richard Gere. They immediately create a bond and have a night of passion which soon becomes a week-long partnership with Gere and Roberts posing as love interests (and of course $3000 is involved as well). Could it be possible that Roberts, a lady with a heart of gold in spite of her background, is just the thing Gere has been needing in his life? A trumped-up adult-oriented version of ""Cinderella"" is probably the best way to describe ""Pretty Woman"". The old Hollywood story gets a glossy new look thanks to director Garry Marshall (doing arguably his finest film-making work). Gere and Roberts make for one of the more attractive pairs the cinema has ever seen. They just shine beacons of light on one another it seems. The fact that both are very good performers definitely enhance their appearances though. A smashing soundtrack and that vivid 1980s style (even though this was released in 1990) make ""Pretty Woman"" one of the big winners of the last few years. 4 stars out of 5."

","What is it about this movie that made it such an instant mega smash when it was released? I'm not sure if it's The incredible chemistry between Gear and Roberts, the smart dialog, the storyline-combination of all of the above-etc etc. But I do think These days, so few GREAT romantic comedies get made. Pretty woman is great. I enjoyed every moment of this and have seen it many times.<br/><br/>I haven't read any IMDb reviews of this yet, I wanted to comment first. This is a lovely story of hope and the true purity of falling madly in love-there are so many movies that try to be romantic and inevitably come across looking forced and contrived. The story and acting in Pretty woman, while very obviously being ""Hollywood"" to a tee, are so natural and free flowing, that it's just a joy to watch this. It's also great to see(in what's not usually the case) a romantic comedy that gets it right, in every area from casting to dialog to pretty much everything from start to finish. Great movie!"

","No, I don't ""follow"" the reviews of ""autumnshowers"" (the preceding reviewer), but I read his/her (?) account of this movie and found it utterly pretentious and completely wrong. Before I begin with MY review of ""Pretty Woman,"" I have to warn you, I'm biased:  This movie is one of my Top Ten Movies of All Time.  Why, you ask?  1)  Julia Roberts in a star- making role.  2)  Richard Gere, who must've realized somewhere during filming that he was playing second fiddle to a young woman in a star-making role.  3)  Jason Alexander at his smarmiest best.  In his eventual obituary (a LONG time from now, we hope!), they'll probably recap that he once slapped Julia Roberts silly in this movie (I know, HISSSSS!!!). 4)  Laura San Giacomo in yet ANOTHER great supporting role.  5)  Hector Elizondo (a fixture in movies directed by Garry Marshall) at his all-time scene-stealing finest.  I love to watch this movie (I've seen it between 50 to 100 times - I know the dialogue by heart) just to see the looks on Elizondo's face when he shares a scene with Roberts.  They run the gamut from reproach to pity to acceptance to admiration and finally to warm respect.<br/><br/>                                          {SPOILER WARNING}<br/><br/>The scene at the end of the movie in which Elizondo (as hotel manager, ""Barney"" Thompson) kisses Roberts' hand, when she extends it for a handshake, and says, ""come back and see us, again, sometime,"" never fails to tug at my heart.  I mean, these two have  really gone through some character development, together.  In Elizondo's final scene in the movie, he agrees to return a necklace and matching earrings, given to him by Richard Gere, to the store he borrowed them from.  Elizondo opens the jewelry box and says, ""it must be difficult to part with something as beautiful as this.""  Of course, he's not talking about the jewelry, he's talking about Julia Roberts who parted company with Gere (reluctantly) the day before.  This sets in motion the BIG reconciliation scene on the fire escape of Roberts' seedy apartment.  Yeah, I know, this movie is about as believable as the Red Sox winning the World Series, but - to me - it's a veritable delight from beginning to end.  No matter how low I feel, this movie ALWAYS brings a smile to my face.  So, WHAT'S so wrong with that?  As a matter of fact, Cinemax is showing this movie TWICE, tomorrow - at 6:15 a.m., and again at 4:00 p.m.  I'll be in the viewing audience, too.  Why?  ""It's the best!""  I know what you're thinking:  WHY doesn't he just tape it?  Well, I did.  However, I like it better when I know OTHER people are watching it at the same time as me.  You know, like sitting in a movie theatre?  The best part is knowing that at least some of these people are watching for the first time. How I envy them!"

","Obviously similar to Shaw's ""Pygmalion"", but updated, more modern.<br/><br/>A lovely dream, one very old: rescuing a prostitute from the street. (Not in Woody Allen's sickish-moody way.) <br/><br/>However, if you wish to dream this one, be sure you do NOT start to think very logically . . . She is healthy, not on drugs, not on alcohol, not even a smoker; no syphilis, no gonorrhea, no AIDS wounds on her legs, nothing, she is just perfectly absolutely healthy. Body and mind. She is not a criminal, not inclined to steal anything, she even values love and dignity more than money. Oh, she has no pimp, who would be the other man (other than Richard Gere) in her life; nobody to protect her from smart types who walk off without paying; the pimp would explode the whole romance instantly. (Instead, a girl friend.) <br/><br/>She has a golden soul, full of goodness, and loves art, and feels for art. High-society types around them appear silly, artificial, stuffy. (Different forks.) She is natural. She even was a good student (!) and . . . might be again? She loves to bathe, and half the time we see her happy in the bath tub (which is a powerful signal and symbol for CLEAN, CLEAN; she even sings so super-ultra-charmingly in the bath; she wants to wash off the foolishness of her previous few months of street. And she can do it.<br/><br/>But with all those qualities, WHY would she ever become a prostitute in the first place? Don't think, don't think. Just dream, it is lovely."
"Catherine_Grace_Zeh","10","95","146","17 November 2005"," Very funny, heart-warming, romantic film with star-studded performances
","Wow! Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute. I was really moved by the blend of humor and romance. The romance was what really moved me. I thought that Edward (Richard Gere) and Vivian (Julia Roberts) looked good in the attire they wore to the opera in San Francisco. Oh, boy, if you ask me, Julia Roberts did, indeed, look like a pretty woman in this movie. PRETTY WOMAN really tugged at my heart and soul and made me laugh at times. Don't say I have a twisted sense of humor, but I laughed really hard when Edward yelled at Stuckey (Jason Alexander) to get out of his hotel room. If I ever travel to Beverly Hills, I'm going to stay at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, that is, if I can afford it. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I think Richard Gere and Julia Roberts each deserved an Academy Award for their performances. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this star-studded hit to anyone who's a fan of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts. You'll laugh, you might cry, you'll be touched, and you'll want to see this box-office smash over and over again."

","Romantic film, nice music, interesting plot, fine beautiful actress, (Mrs. Roberts) and handsome actor, (Mr. Gere) in prime roles, a success story from the very beginning. But, although I am enjoying movies like that, I would never rate this one as 9. The difference (and the extra points) is made by the secondary role actor Mr. Elizondo! I saw him, for the first time, in a rather extreme and rather stupid drama/comedy ""Young doctors in love"" (1982) and I was impressed by his acting performance. In ""Pretty woman"" he is the absolute star. The script supported his role, of course, but the talent is indisputable."

","Look where we were in 1990. No wonder we are were we are in 2017. The movie is charming enough with a splendid Julia Roberts becoming a huge movie star but, I have to say, watching it now gave me shivers. This is not Pygmalion, no, there is no insight, it's all superficial to a cringing degree. She finds redemption through her shopping and his credit cards. Isn't that lovely? It feels so insane that maybe that means we're evolving. - I saw Pretty Woman last night with a group who had never seen it before. Funny thing the young conservative, Christian women loved it - They didn't seem to mind the message of sex and money. The young Liberal women found it absurd, offensive and the charm of the film, dangerously misleading. They left long before the happy ending. Movies become historical documents, don't they."
"roghache","9","53","79","8 March 2006"," Wonderful Cinderella / Pygmalion tale, hooker style
","What can I say that hasn't been said? This immensely popular, modern fairy tale romance is a fantastic 'feel good' must see. I can't resist watching it every single time it comes on TV. To tempt you if you haven't seen it...it's the story of a feisty, good hearted hooker named Vivian Ward, who is hired for a week by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, to serve as his escort at a number of business related social functions. Needless to say, the relationship doesn't stay 'just business' for long.<br/><br/>Rather than the plot itself, the beautiful Julia Roberts makes this movie...and not simply because of her 88 inches of leg! Always endearing in her roles, she is at her absolute MOST endearing portraying Vivian in this picture. She brings a real vulnerability to the role, showing us that just like everyone else, prostitutes do indeed floss their teeth! Richard Gere pulls off quite convincingly the role of Edward, the ruthless, calculating millionaire businessman, who takes over companies only to sell them off piece by piece, quite unmindful of the interests of any people involved. To give Gere credit, I was quite impressed that he actually plays the piano in one of the movie's scenes.<br/><br/>Naturally, given Vivian's membership in the 'oldest profession', there is sex early on...though I, old fashioned and strict as I am, wouldn't hesitate to let my young teen see this movie. (There's worse in TV commercials today!) Oddly, the most truly intimate moment in this film is not during the more explicit sex but rather, simply a kiss.<br/><br/>Ohhhh, lots of romantic scenes, from a picnic in the park to jetting off in a private plane for a Big Night on the Town. And etiquette lessons...Vivian displays charming, amusing, curious innocence when she experiences with Edward her first opera (all the while looking knock out gorgeous in a stunning red gown), her first polo match, and her introduction to escargots. As the movie progresses, she is transformed Pygmalion style, from the street smart hooker provocatively dressed in tall black boots and mini skirt, to a sophisticated looking, elegantly gowned and coiffed young lady. But it's merely appearance...Vivian's heart of gold and her vulnerability both remain unchanged.<br/><br/>The status conscious snobbery of Beverly Hills dress shops and ritzy hotels, judging people by wealth and class, is well depicted here. When Vivian goes shopping for a 'more appropriate' wardrobe at some exclusive Rodeo Drive boutiques, she is not 'well received' by the sales ladies, who like all too many of us, are overly inclined to judge by appearance. You'll want these snobs to get their comeuppance. Actually, perhaps the most touching relationship in this entire film is the one between Vivian and Barney, the quite proper but kind desk manager at the high class hotel (where she is sharing a penthouse suite with Edward), who is able to see beyond appearance. He develops a genuine fondness and even more importantly, respect for her.<br/><br/>Other characters of interest...Kit is Vivian's appealing and sympathetic room-mate, also a hooker (Vivian's a loyal friend), and Stuckey is Edward's sleazy and despicable business colleague, portrayed by Seinfeld's Jason Alexander, a TV show which I must confess is not my favourite. <br/><br/>As events unfold during the film, it becomes clear that, while Edward might not understand too clearly the meaning of 'prostitution', Vivian clearly does. And, it's another shining film illustration of that pearl of wisdom from Eliza Doolittle (of My Fair Lady) who enlightened us, 'The difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves, but how she is treated.' Or, in Vivian's own words, 'People put you down enough, you start to believe it'.<br/><br/>Great Cinderella movie...don't miss it."

","Sometimes you have a romantic comedy that is remembered for a long time. Movies with Audrey Hepburn, 'When Harry Met Sally...', little parts from other Meg Ryan-movies and... 'Pretty Woman'. Of course we have the famous song and the real launch of the Julia Roberts career that help a little but it just is one sweet and very funny movie.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is great in romantic comedies and especially with this movie (and 'Notting Hill') she proves this. With Richard Gere she has a perfect chemistry and in the end that is all we want to see. That Roberts is a prostitute and Gere a very rich man, living in a penthouse, make things only more interesting, joke-wise. One of the better romantic comedies made in the past and definitely one to watch again. And again. And may be again."

"bnw804","4","33","57","4 December 2015"," How could anyone view this movie as romantic?
","I had the pleasure of watching Pretty Woman for the first time a few nights ago. I came away from it absolutely flabbergasted, trying to figure out what the people of 1990 could have possibly seen in this movie as appealing.<br/><br/>I've seen other reviews. People go for the easy shots, saying that it's ""hokey"", that Julia Roberts is too pretty for a hooker, but then people move past that and talk about how much they love the movie anyway. No one seems interested in discussing the absolutely horrifying implications about love and relationships that this movie presents.<br/><br/>But first, I do have positive things to say about the lead actors. Julia Roberts is adorable (and I'm not normally a fan of hers), and her cute, fish-out-of-waterness is really the only thing that can make this movie tolerable. And as for Richard Gere -- well, I'm absolutely delighted that he is no longer appearing in movies.<br/><br/>The idea that this is a love story is absurd. There is no love, here. Gere's character of Edward is acquiring a woman to suit his every need. And Roberts' hooker Vivian would have gone through the exact same experience with literally any rich man. Because Edward is literally any rich man. He has absolutely no discernible personality beyond doing generic rich person things. There is a peculiar escalation of culture throughout the movie. It starts with ""I Love Lucy"" in the hotel room, moving up into dinner parties, the opera (which Edward claims to be part of his soul, although his passion for it never comes up again), polo (does anyone actually do that?), and a particularly laughable scene of him reading to Vivian from a book of ""Shakespeare's Quotations"". That last one actually makes a great metaphor for Edward's character. He is a book of quotations without a hint of an actual play.<br/><br/>Vivian is a terrible prostitute. But really, that's not fair, because she's not a prostitute at all. Apart from her clothes, Vivian has nothing about her to suggest a life of prostitution. At no point in the movie is anything said to suggest her past sexual activity. There is no pimp, no past john returning for another go. She doesn't even get cat-called like the other anonymous hookers seen on the street in the film's opening. No, instead we get a conveniently monogamous atmosphere between Vivian and Edward, where we don't even see any sexual contact between them until they've fallen properly ""in love"". But there was sexual contact; that's important to remember. It's important to remember that when he says ""I never treated you like a prostitute,"" that he has, in fact, been paying her for sex. I have to wonder what qualifies as treating a woman like a prostitute in his twisted mind.<br/><br/>This movie is terribly unfair to prostitutes. Not just because it whitewashes the vulnerable woman actually suffering on the streets with a cute Cinderella story, but it's also unfair to the legitimate, independent, professional escorts, who are being represented by a doe-eyed sugar-daddy-seeker who thinks she's driving a hard bargain by charging a multimillionaire $300 a night.<br/><br/>Being a prostitute is the least relevant part of Vivian's character, because she conveniently solves Edward's every problem: from giving him directions, to showing him how to drive a stick-shift (insert innuendo here), to helping him tie a tie (yes, the man who has been wealthy his whole life and spends all his time in high-powered business meetings doesn't know how to tie a tie). Edward treats Vivian as an asset, and doesn't show any real emotion throughout the movie. Vivian likes money, and she conveniently falls for the guy who provides that money and attends to her every need.<br/><br/>There is no romance here."
"chazz46","Null","16","25","6 October 2007"," Beauty always trumps the top Human Ideals
","PRETTYWOMANas poor thesis for humanity As long as we are talking about women, beauty, etc., I thought I would bring up my singular position as actually having HATED the movie ""Pretty Woman"" as opposed to everyone else I talk to. The movie ""Pretty Woman"" appears to do injustice to the realistic expectations of our youth in the sense that this movie preyed upon the sensual powers of attraction that physical beauty has over the intellect and other non-physical attributes which, on the other hand, truly are the foundations for the ideal man and woman relationships. When it was said, ""It must be difficult leaving something so beautiful"" (this being a $250,000 necklace as a concrete representation of a beautiful woman) such placement of beauty on a pedestal lends to the difficulty of maintaining one's grasp of the conventional ideal that a well-educated person, amongst other ideals, is to be placed on the pinnacle of desirability. After all, beauty of the human being does not take outstanding craftsmanship as needed to create such a necklace....nor does a naturally beautiful person require any major toil and effort on the part of many to obtain the raw materials for these craftsmen. Rather, quite simply, this beautiful woman symbolizes the antithesis of all requisite efforts that must come together to create and produce wealth of mankind. In short, random luck provides a particular human being with an attractive appearance that trumps all other ideals that we hold as more important. The powerful, intellectual, and educated man's (Richard Gere's character) choice for this woman (Julia Robert's character) primarily on beauty alone, tends to denigrate all of the human effort to rise above our baseline naivete and ignorance. With all of his character's accomplishment, why does he not seek out a woman who has climbed Mt Kilimanjaro, collected high level degrees, and started her own successful company, etc.? This film captures the dilemma for man---that, in spite of our ideal of becoming honest in the sense of Ayn Rand's thesis (""An honest man (or woman) is one who does not consume more than he produces or creates"") and productive through the development of our minds, he still cannot resist basic God-given beauty. By the popularity of this movie, I think it points out this phenomenon, and furthermore tends to promote beauty over the other ideals. In fact, there are masses of achievers and educated individuals who successfully ward off the temptations of beauty and choose the attractiveness of a well-developed mind and on-going accomplishment. To me, this movie seems to help perpetuate the sophomoric and juvenile concept that beauty, romantic relationships, and self-directed pleasure rather than development of God-given potential are all that life is about. One might say that this movie gives the beautiful person (as well as the person who perceives oneself as such) a mistaken notion, or at least a temptation, to rely solely on that beauty and to ultimately cash in on it and as a result live a superficial meaningless life, without ever achieving one's God-given potential.

He is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at Disney/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.<br/><br/>Had Richard Gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attaché case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or Asian or Spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.<br/><br/>I didn't like it 15 years ago, when I didn't understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called ""love"".<br/><br/>This movie is NOT a romantic comedy.

You could also see the film as a commercial for prostitution. Cynically, you might agree that it's preferable to get money for the abuse instead of giving it away, but that is not the point that the movie makes, unfortunately. It's basically a Cinderella-story but 'Cinderella' in this case is a thoroughly used one and the prince is a moron. If all rich people were like him, then there would be no rich people. But, again, it is not the point of this movie to make you think that. No, no. The rich are all good and they all marry whores and yet they manage to keep their money and grace.

Now, I consider myself a very open-minded fella, I try not to prejudice myself against chick-flicks and I'm one guy that actually likes a true romantic film.  But this one is just plain overrated SCHMALTZ the whole way through.  Why is it that EVERY leading man in these corny modern movies has to look exactly the same?  As a movie fan, I have trouble rooting for a tall, handsome pretty-boy with an overflowing bank account who could have any woman he wants.  But I guess this film wasn't made for us ""unenlightened men who don't go to movies and have no need for romance in our lives.""  If you believe THAT, you'll believe this movie.  And as in every Disney film made in the last fifty years, you have the token evil guy who also happens to be short, bald, and unattractive (Jason Alexander). Isn't this a bit of a childish cop-out, casting the short, bald semetic man as the ""bad guy""?  What is this, a German propoganda film?!  Sorry if I'm getting a bit preachy, I just really hate the message that these films project onto a generation of lovelorn women.  The whole fairy tale of the handsome knight rescuing the damsel in distress from a life of loneliness is just that; a fairy tale.  The truth is, there's no such thing as the perfect man, or ""Mr. Right"" just like there's no perfect woman, so please stop creating this standard for perfection that doesn't exist, and stop trying to brainwash movie audiences into thinking that wealth and beauty makes a good human being.  Just hope you find a kind, sensitive, and wonderful man who loves you for you!  Trust me, that's as good as it gets on this warped planet.  If you'd like to see a really BEAUTIFUL romance on film, check out ""Picnic"", ""Casablanca"", or ""Now, Voyager!""  They're OLD movies, but they were made at a time when Hollywood wasn't cranking out love stories in a tired old formula.  The characters are true-to-life, the plotlines are original, and even better, BOTH sexes can enjoy these films.

","In ""Pretty Woman"" Richard Gere plays an executive attempting to acquire a shipyard so that he can tear the company into small pieces and sell it off for scrap. While he is about this dirty business, he hires a street-walking hooker played by Julia Roberts for companionship. All of this is believable until the purely-for-hire relationship with the whore turns into a warm intimate relationship that seems to change the businessman's character so much for the better that he reverses his decision to decimate the company he is preying upon and even proposes marriage to the hooker. <br/><br/>The makers of this film would like us to forget everything we have ever learned about prostitution  that it takes place in an environment of corruption and is itself a cause of corruption, misery and disease  in favor of the absurd notion that sex for hire is a convenient, appealing and pleasurable way for couples to meet and establish a love relationship.<br/><br/>The producers were very clever in hiring deadpan actor Richard Gere to present their false point of view to innocent viewers, because everything else about the movie smirks at the jades in the audience, not too subtly concealing its lewd in-jokes and boorish innuendo beneath a paper thin veneer of polish and elegance. Worst of all, it openly and chivalrously takes the part of prostitutes against those who may disapprove of them.<br/><br/>""Pretty Woman"" is the type of manipulative movie that does everything it can to sell the audience on its values, without making an effort to distinguish between itself and real life. For suggestible viewers, it presents a danger that they may imitate what they see on screen, and then find out too late that real life is not anywhere near so pleasant or easy when it comes to dealing with low life criminals or the vulgar and licentious rich.<br/><br/>I once heard a very successful and well regarded professor of screen writing remark that ""it's much better to be rich than to be poor.""

","I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.<br/><br/>We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. <br/><br/>Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please.<br/><br/>Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.<br/><br/>I'll finish on a song:<br/><br/>Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could spend as much as you Mercy<br/><br/>Pretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me<br/><br/>Pretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me..and I'll pay you..I'll treat you right"

I was eighteen at the time(do the math!),and so that may've affected how I felt about the movie then,because asked then how I would've rated it,I probably would've given it a ten. Nine at the lowest.<br/><br/>Mostly,I was in love with Julia Roberts at the time,and why not? She was a rising young star at the time,effervescent and able to absolutely run with this film the way Barry Sanders or Emmitt Smith(American footballers for those of you reading not from the US or don't follow the NFL or sports in general)could run with the pigskin.Also,I loved how the Cinderella story was played with not too much sentiment(up until the last fifteen minutes,of course)and a lot of humor. Richard Gere seemed to make a good,sober counterbalance to Miss Roberts' earthy,relaxed persona,as well.<br/><br/>Looking back on it now and having re-watched it a number of times,the film loses points with me on two levels. One,I've become increasingly annoyed with director Garry Marshall's style,which seems to be intent on making the world believe that fairy tales are everywhere and love is the natural storybook end to EVERY relationship. Second,I think this story is SO Hollywood sanitized that what it lacks in a particularly plausible storyline in tries to make up for in attractive,glossed up casting(I betting it's pretty tough to find a hooker ANYWHERE who looks as good as a young Julia Roberts!)and a sugary sweet ending.It was good enough for me back when I was young and hadn't seen as many films,not so good now.Not to mention making a capable comic foil actor such as Jason Alexander so one-dimensional that it makes you wonder how he scored the ""Seinfeld"" gig!<br/><br/>Still,I find it to be charming and reasonably(albeit shamelessly) entertaining enough to watch it again,which I have since I actually own a copy of the film.Keep in mind,that,too,was something I got as a gift,when(you guessed it)I was eighteen."

","Probably one of the most sexist, unrealistic and outright offensive movies I've ever seen. Julia Roberts plays a clean, sweet, beautiful prostitute who is 'rescued' by a millionaire businessman (Richard Gere) who tells her what to wear and how to act as she escorts him from place to place and sleeps with him for $3000. They fall in love, and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>A lot of the other characters were unrealistic as well. Are we honestly expected to believe that the high-priced hotel staff would be THAT nice to Vivian? I understand that this is taken from ""Pygmalian"", but other versions (ie My Fair Lady) were less sexist and more realistic than this dribble. This movie teaches girls that wealthy men will save you, and that prostitution is a lively, cultured job with no disease, physical or mental harm, financial strife, or drug addiction."

","On one level, I enjoy ""Pretty Woman"". While I'm not particularly a big fan of Richard Gere or [the very overrated] Julia Roberts, their chemistry in the film is great, and the film works as a decent romantic comedy on a superficial level. <br/><br/>But I just can't get beyond how morrally bankrupt this film is. Characteristic of Hollywood, the much more cynical original incarnation of the script (titled ""3000"") attempted to really look into the our seedy values behind money and prostitution. The fact that director Garry Marshall would take such material and twist it into hollywood shlock is therefore quite depressing. The worst part is that you can still see small remnants of the films roots (especially the beginning) which has been bleached out as much as possible. <br/><br/>What is this film really saying? It seems like greed, not love is the real answer (the scene where Roberts gets the gift of the Credit Card makes me want to vomit). <br/><br/>In summary, there are a lot of appealing elements on the surface of ""Pretty Woman"", but the underlying subject matter is disturbing and contradictory to the film's message. While I personally think this film deserves a 1, I'll give it a 5 in a nod to all you people out there who care only about how ""cute"" Richard and Julia look together in this movie.<br/><br/>For a real romantic comedy from this period, see ""Sleepless in Seattle"" instead."

","Though I understand why so many people love this movie, I couldn't help but experience I creeping sense of unease when I saw it. The attempt to idealize what is really one of the most sordid, unappealing professions in America seems not only to undermine all the efforts to date to eradicate both the demand for prostitution and the seemingly Cinderella-esque appeal of prostitution, but to stroke our collective consciousness into a false sense of inculpability. Admittedly most of the people watching the movie do not directly relate to either of the two poles in the movie, the downtrodden Julia Roberts nor the fairy-tale prince Richard Gear. This means that the situation portrayed is more easily accepted as a fairy tale than real life, but for those more practically acquainted with the all-too-real world of prostitution, this movie is a slap in the face and a reminder that a story like Roberts' could never happen outside the fairy tale world.<br/><br/>If Julia Roberts were living in the real world of prostitution, she would be a bleary-eyed smack addict unconnected and unconcerned about her clients. The only way she might make a real profit off Richard Gear would be if her pimp collected extortion from him and gave her a cut.<br/><br/>Take it from someone who's been there.

It does not result in fancy outfits, thrill rides in sports cars, or offers to escape it all for free. Of the 130 San Francisco prostitutes studied, 82% had been physically assaulted, 83% had been threatened with a weapon, 68% had been raped while working, and 84% reported current or past homelessness (Farley, 1998). Furthermore, 68% met the criteria for a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Similar studies are listed below.<br/><br/>The movie presents an unrealistic picture of this situation, and therefore trivializes a serious issue and exempts men who solicit prostitutes from examining the ill effects of their behavior.

","I saw this last evening in Oakland's Paramount. I see maybe five movies in the course of a year. It's not my favorite artistic medium. And this film is one of the reasons why--more hype than substance.<br/><br/>The movie soon took on an appearance of director Garry Marshall attempting to spoof past romance movies by creating sly allusions to those films in this movie. For a bit--the viewer would think that was a 5 foot 10 Audrey Hepburn walking down Rodeo Drive. The film clips of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in ""Affair to Remember"". Julia as Vivian screaming out loud at the polo match--Audrey Hepburn--""Move your bloomin arse..."" at the Ascot. And even in the end--Richard Gere walking up the fire escape with an umbrella--""Mary Poppins""--another movie about transformation--transformation from self-centered parents to parents interested in their growing children.<br/><br/>The movie is not really about falling in love with a prostitute. It is about transformation of a prostitute into a lady; transformation from perceiving a woman as a prostitute to seeing the woman as a wife.<br/><br/>Transformation is a perdurable theme from Hollywood. ""A Star is Born."" ""My Fair Lady""--itself a literal takeoff on George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion"". ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". ""An Affair to Remember."" The theme is a Hollywood staple and has been done with excellence by each of those cited movies. But the theme is not just a film trope, it is a trope of reality for each of these stars. The individual--Julia Roberts--transformed into mega-actress (movie star). Frances Ethel Gumm transformed into Judy Garland; Archy Leach transformed into Cary Grant; Marion Mitchell Morrison transformed into John Wayne; Benjamin Kubelsky to Jack Benny--and so on. (And for so many Hollywood types, disaster is prevented with a stroke of good judgment and discernment. Not just discernment for good movie roles but good judgment to stay away from self-destructive behavior. In the original film concept--Vivian is a cocaine user; and we all know what that is potential for.<br/><br/>It seemed that every cliché was used in this movie--and then some. Like I say--I see maybe five movies a year; I'm glad I passed this one by in 1990. I just saw (1995) ""French Kiss"" with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline--now that was a romantic comedy."

","Isn't it funny that some movies you need to watch a number of times before the plot and the action burn themselves into your mind, while others you need only watch once and you are cursed for the rest of your life remembering the movie. This is the case with Pretty Woman. I watched it quite some time ago, and still remember that it is about a lonely business man on a trip to Los Angeles, picks up a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard, and then falls in love with her.<br/><br/>This is a typical Cinderella story in a sense. Okay Cinderella was imprisoned in her castle as a scullery maid by her ugly step sisters, but is rescued by her fairy godmother, given a wonderful night with Prince Charming, and then flees before midnight only to have Prince Charming track her down and marry her. This is not necessarily the plot of this film, but it is a story of a less than ordinary woman (she is a hooker) who is found by a wealthy individual who then falls in love with her. Thus while it is rags to riches, it is through marriage that the heroine goes from being a hooker to being a princess.<br/><br/>This was a very popular movie, but it was not one of the great movies in that it came out, flew high, and then returned to obscurity. However it is one that sits on my mother's shelf, despite me cringing at the idea of creating a romantic movie round a prostitute. I can see that there would have been a lot of criticism regarding making a woman of the night the heroine, and raising her up to a new lifestyle. There are many that would cringe at that and claim that such a woman does not deserve a chance to succeed. She doesn't really succeed though, she is in the right place at the right time, and is picked up by the right man.<br/><br/>I would not recommend that people go out and become prostitutes simply so that they might meet the man of their dreams, it simply does not happen. In some countries prostitution is legal (such as Germany and the Netherlands) however that is not the case in the US. It is still illegal and while those who hire the services may not necessarily be thugs, it is a culture that is permeated with drugs and violence.<br/><br/>The final thing I wish to mention is the kissing. Throughout the movie we are told that prostitutes do not kiss and suggest that is because kissing brings about a more intimate relationship, which is not what prostitution is about. This is rubbish since sex in and of itself creates an intimate relationship. The best reason I found out about the reason behind the non-kissing rule is more to prevent the transmission of disease than about anything somewhat to do with intimate relationships."

","Some of the dialogue is funny, some of the actors are great but for the most part this is some egregious stuff.  The Cinderella theme seems a little out of date in a hooker/john movie.  Of course she is entitled to dream but I don't think the movie has the slightest idea what a hooker actually has to endure.  I am not saying I do either, but then again I am not making a movie. <br/><br/>There is almost no realism in the movie and you are told Viv is a hooker but there is no other evidence of that onscreen.  You do not believe for a second she falls in love with Gere - why would you, there is nothing going on between them as far as screen chemistry goes.  All of the drama is forced and immature.  No one acts like this in the real world. I don't know any millionaires or hookers, but come on, the audience does not have to in order to judge these people. <br/><br/>I can easily recommend Laura San Giacomo's portrayal of Kit, Roberts's roommate, and naturally since this is a Garry Marshall movie, Hector Elizondo is in it and he is very enjoyable too.   <br/><br/>Boy, someone up there liked Julia the day she was nominated for Best Actress along side Kathy Bates, Joanne Woodward, Angelica Huston and Meryl Streep. If you look at that list, you have to ask yourself that age old question - ""what is wrong with this picture?"" At least she didn't win, thank God, thanks to Kathy Bates' unforgettable ""Misery"".

You'll have to see it for yourself, but the ending is just so Hollywood.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a encyclopedia of stereotypes, a movie that glamorizes the patriarchal world-view that rich men in fast cars will make any woman's problems disappear with the signing of a marriage certificate just like the idea in the old sexist days that knights in shining armor will sweep the princess of her feet.

"cinemaniac2002","3","20","40","30 June 2013"," Disgraceful
","I must admit that I find this movie one of the most offensive ever to come out of Hollywood. I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. <br/><br/>The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. <br/><br/>First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. <br/><br/>After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to ""escort"" him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A.<br/><br/>Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight.<br/><br/>So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. <br/><br/>I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. <br/><br/>I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto.<br/><br/>Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem.<br/><br/>This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace. I will agree that it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar and win some awards -- because so many movies are contrived, complete and utter nonsense."

Richard Gere was supposed to pick up the hooker, use her for the time he was in town and then dump her. That would have been perhaps realistic. Although if you're going to use hookers, why would you want the same one for more than one night?<br/><br/>Add to that that Julia Roberts is simply devoid of acting ability, and is not exactly what the title of the movie promises, and you have a film with no heart, no soul, and no reason to exist.<br/><br/>If you're going to adapt Pygmalion, then look to My Fair Lady or even Educating Rita for your cues on how to do it right.

","Films about hookers and their patrons are a common feature of all national cinemas.According to a rough estimate,films about hookers have always been a good box office proposition.This might be because of people's belief that they are objects of reverence.This is the reason why Hollywood is not at all an exception as far as films about women of easy virtue are concerned.The only thing which differs American/ Hollywood films from those of other countries is their narrative structure.Hollywood cinema relies more on the external appearance of hookers whereas world cinema focuses more on internal quest of hookers for achieving a state of security,safety,prosperity and happiness. Pretty Woman fails to deliver because it is not at all serious cinema. It can neither be termed as a prototype of fun cinema as it lacks credibility which is evident in Leaving Las Vegas.As Hollywood film industry has its own peculiar way of portraying hookers viewers have little or no choice of rejecting such flicks.There are plenty of gaping holes in Pretty Woman.It is being labeled as a fairy tale of a hooker with golden heart.This is absurd as viewers are not in a position to figure out whether it is due to severe distress or a young girl's desire to lead a lavish life.Pretty Woman is a dismal failure as in real life people deal harshly with hookers making their lives miserable.Pretty Woman is a historic blunder too as it degrades women."

Hey Mom how did you and Dad meet? Oh I was hooking down on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and your Dad gave me $100 to spend the night with him. Isn't that sooo romantic. Blech! Imagine every time they get into an argument and he tells her she is just hooker anyway and should be happy with what she's got. Although, this film was made in the 90's it must have been written in the 50's back when men had some crazy control issues and wished they could just keep women down...oh wait a minute how much has really changed since then?

","Prince Charming Comes Back was the title for one of the best reviews I read for Pretty Woman back when I was only fifteen years of age. I was forbidden to see the film, my mother thinking I would instantly be standing on street corners looking for Lotuses, but I saw it anyway. Three times. When it came on video I watched it until the tape died and I needed to buy another, and another. Then, I bought a DVD player JUST for it. I've gotten into many heated discussions about how this movie degrades women and gives young girls the wrong ideas about things. But that is NOT how I look at it at all.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the movie is when Vivian and Edward are in bed, talking and Vivian goes on about how she ended up in Los Angeles to begin with by following a ""bum"" that her mother called her a ""bum magnet"" ""If there was a bum within a fifty mile radius I was completely attracted to him."" But the line that stuck with me the most was ""When people put you down enough you start to believe it"" and Edward replies ""I think you are a very charming, very beautiful woman"" Vivian's reply is full of emotion when she replies ""The bad stuff is easier to believe...have you ever noticed that?"" Which is true.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I think that this movie is just a fairytale, and fairytales are there to make you believe in something that is totally unbelievable. This movie gives you hope, shows you that even if your life is miserable, that even if you are a bum magnet; if you don't give up hope a millionaire in a Lotus might be just around the corner.<br/><br/>""Welcome to Hollywood, what's your dream?

","Well, I'm a woman, and legend has it that every woman wants one day meet her millionaire prince charming, because then she will be happy forever. I disagree vehemently with that belief and that's why I hated Pretty Woman. First of all, why not portray the life of a street prostitute like for real? I don't see problems in show a friendly, playful and hardworking prostitute. But why hide the routine of aggression and constant violence that these woman suffer? Pretty Woman ignores these important and essential aspects completely. And then we enter the most serious part, the old lie ""The Man saves the woman of the streets."" Why not show the reality, that is: in the life of a real prostitute, the men overwhelmingly are the PROBLEM, not the salvation.<br/><br/>I'm not criticizing love. There are many prostitutes fall in love in real life. But why the guy she loves needs to be a millionaire? The good guy of the film could be an average man, but who loved her and had good intentions. But no, of course not! After all Hollywood need to perpetuate the lie that a person can only find true happiness when becoming a MILLIONAIRE or marrying a MILLIONAIRE. Moreover, the movie show a very conservative and confortable plot, where Vivian Ward, a prostitute, be seen sleeping exclusively with Edward Lewis, it's literally a monogamous relationship, she don't have sex with any other guy, she doesn't use drugs, she has no past trauma. Oh Really? She didn't have a pimp, too. Of course, another man in the area would ruin the Hollywood romantic dream.

For instance: Vivian was a prostitute who couldn't pay her rent and was intimidated by a couple of sales clerks then in the course of a few days we are suppose to believe her outlook had changed so much that she would turn down Edward's offer to 'keep' her without a second thought. Then we are suppose to believe in the same amount of time Edward goes from buying Viv's companionship to wanting to set her up in an apartment to overcoming his fear of heights in order to impress her.

"filipemanuelneto","7","3","4","22 September 2019"," A good romantic comedy that seems to me to have been undermined by some prejudice against the oldest profession in the world.
","Vivan is a street prostitute. We know almost nothing of her life, nor the reasons why she has taken the path of prostitution, but she is notoriously beautiful and stands out among the other girls who, along with her, wait for anyone who wants them. By chance, his path intersects with that of Edward Lewis, a millionaire who made a fortune buying and dismantling failed companies. We are not sure why he decides to hire her, it seems like a decision made at the moment ... but the fact is that he changes her life in a way that reminds me of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" ...<br/><br/>This romantic comedy departs from rather unrealistic assumptions. Even millionaires who hire prostitutes do not usually go to the streets to look for or relate to them. On the other hand, a street prostitute would never look as clean and immaculate as Julia Roberts in this movie. Here are some flaws in realism that can compromise history, depending on how important each one gives them. But ultimately, it's a dream movie. ""What's your dream? Everyone in Los Angeles has a dream."" That's what a man on the streets says during the movie, and that can almost be the moral of the story: there are dreams that, with a touch of luck, can come true.<br/><br/>I loved Julia Roberts's performance ... this movie helped the actress jump to stardom, which was pretty fair. She has talent and presence, as we will see in later films (Notting Hill, Erin Brockovich, etc.). Richard Gere makes a good romantic pair with her and is credible in the role of a millionaire who has failed in love and seems in need of female attention. Both dominate the movie and bring the best moments to life, ranging from romantic and moving scenes to the hilarious ones we can see. Next to them, a capable but discreet secondary cast, where Hector Elizondo stands in the role of a rigid and professional hotel manager.<br/><br/>I think this movie has always been a risky gamble, if only because of the strong prejudice society still holds towards prostitution. And I believe some have written harsh criticism of this movie just for involving a prostitute in the story. But prostitutes are not vile, polluted and sick creatures who must live on the fringes of society. Often its women (and men) who have had no luck in life, or made the wrong choices, or immigrants who have been deceived and are trying to make money without harming anyone, often under the cruel dictatorship of pimps who only think about profits. Glamorizing prostitution is a mistake, but diabolizing is even worse. It is a sign of a small mind and lack of Christian values and empathy for those who have been less fortunate than us. Worse than living off making money with one's own body is killing or stealing, and there is no shortage of films that glamorize theft and murder without anyone caring about it."

It's hard to even call her ""pretty"", the first word in the tittle of the movie. She's not ugly, but she's just a little above average, bordering on pretty. That aside, stud millionaires do not fall in love with hookers. They might pay one from time to time, but they don't fall in love them. The whole premise of this movie is idiotic, so the movie is unsuccessful to me as a whole. All that aside, Gere was very good in the film, and Roberts acting was also very good.

","Garry Marshall may not be the most interesting director working in Hollywood, but his movies are definitely entertaining, and in that sense he is successful. Perhaps his two greatest films, which also are the ones he'll most likely be remembered for, are ""Beaches"" and ""Pretty Woman"". One of the most commercially successful (almost $500m worldwide!!) romantic comedies of all time,""Pretty Woman"" is a charming modern day fairy tale that works largely in part to the phenomenal on-screen chemistry between its two stars  Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. In an Academy Award nominated performance as Vivian Ward, Julia Roberts truly shines. Her screen presence is nothing short of radiating, not to mention she's a highly skilled comedic actress. The film also owes a lot to its equally strong supporting performances from Jason Alexander, Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo.

The rest of the cast gave good performances I thought such as Jason Alexander playing Edward's lawyer Phil and Hector Elizondo did an excellent job playing the hotel manager Barney Thompson. I also thought that the late Ralph Bellamy gave a good performance as the role of James Morse who is the owner of the company who Edward is trying to buy.

","I think that ""Pretty Woman"" watched by everyone in those days. Though pieces, but watched. And heard about it in the media, because it is a cult romantic film. It continued to be one of the best and loved romantic movies in the world. I'm not going to tell you about the plot of the story, because I think that everyone knows about it. I am a big fan of this movie, and I think I like it not only because it is played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts or because of a lot of funny moment and just a beautiful movie. Instead, I like it because even though everything that is filmed in this movie is kind of a fairy tale and can't be realistic when we watch it, we don't even feel that it is not real. Also, I think that many of us like it, because it is not copied from other movies, one of the biggest advantages of this movie is that all scenes are new ones and we can see the repetition of this theme scenes in other movies. Another plus of this movie as I already mention it includes a lot of ridiculous movies and my favorite one is the restaurant scene. It is when she struggles with the dish, and then the waiter deftly catches the getaway snail. It is so funny, and the actors also play it very realistically. Another moment that again I think all viewers like is when she very sneezes very loudly sneezes into a scarf of the hotel's manager.
A great thanks to all actors that play in this movie, because all of them perfectly fit in their characters. Manager's actor fits his role as he has a friendly smile, also the same I can say about another worker of this hotel, who again perfectly plays a friendly person. The bad character of this movie immediately cannot like the viewer, because the film makers chose a fat actor with narrow eyes, which immediately leads to distrust of this character.
Overall, it is a great movie, which the unrealistically makes realistic.A great thanks to the all actors that play in this movie, because all of them perfectly fit in their characters.

","The first time I saw 'Pretty Woman' was about 10 years ago and I hated it. Now i got the DVD as a present and decided to give it another chance and I must say that perhaps I was being too harsh the first time. It's not a terrible film but not my favourite of this genre either. 'Pretty Woman' is extremely sugarcoated so do not expect anything other than...well, in the pretty woman's own words, fairy tale. That's what this is. It is another adaptation of 'Pygmalion' and bears a lot of resemblance to the wonderful 'My Fair Lady'. Julia Roberts plays Viviane, the cleanest prostitute. Don't analyze but Viviane is intelligent, not a junkie, very clean, healthy, prefers money over love...alright stop there and just remember that it's a fairy tale. The strength of the movie is of course The Richard Gere - Julia Roberts chemistry. On his own, Gere doesn't manage to make much of an impression. He's just okay but when sharing the screen with Roberts, he does well. Julia Roberts is the pretty woman and she carries it off eloquently. Laura San Giacomo is likable as Kit and Hector Elizondo is awesome. Garry Marshal's direction is alright although the film does drag in some parts. The soundtrack fits well with the movie and who could forget the title song? In a nutshell, one shouldn't expect anything other than a fairy tale or else chances are there will be disappointment."

","Julia Roberts got her first Best Actress nomination for Pretty Woman where she plays a working girl who has a chance meeting with an Eighties economic entrepreneur played elegantly by Richard Gere. When you think about the film, it's an absolutely unreal fantasy, but carried off brilliantly by the charm of its leads.<br/><br/>It's one of those chance meetings as Roberts is looking to pay her's and roommate Laura San Giacomo's rent. Gere gets himself lost in Hollywood on the way to Beverly Hills and stops and asks Roberts for directions. Those kind of instructions she doesn't normally give, but incredibly enough they hit it off and Gere brings her back to his penthouse suite at the Regent Beverly Hotel. I'm not sure there is such a place in real life. <br/><br/>Turns out he needs her for a business date as he's negotiating with Ralph Bellamy and Alex Hyde-White for their company. Gere essentially does what Danny DeVito does in Other People's Money, but with a little more class. But with lube or not, Bellamy and Hyde-White aren't taking this one without a fight.<br/><br/>Julia's character is part Pygmalion, part Cinderella and who would think she would find as a fairy godfather Hector Elizondo, manager of the Regent Beverly. Normally his job would be to throw working girls out of the place, but Elizondo is charmed by her as everyone else.<br/><br/>Pretty Woman marked the farewell appearance of Ralph Bellamy who made his film debut in 1931. Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Bellamy kept going right up to the end when a lot of them were forcibly retired due to the collapse of the studio system. Bellamy to his credit also never did garbage strictly for a paycheck as some others did.<br/><br/>One other interesting character of note is Jason Alexander known to most as George Costanza of Seinfeld. Costanza's a pretty smarmy character in his own right, but Alexander who plays Gere's lawyer makes Costanza look like an Eagle Scout.<br/><br/>In Pretty Woman, both Roberts and Gere learn some valuable life lessons from each other. And the audience will learn a couple also if they get to view Pretty Woman."
"theowinthrop","10","6","14","28 July 2007"," Princess Vivian and Prince Edward Save Each Other
","The economic monsters of the 1980s and 1990s included vast corporate take-overs for the purpose of the selling off of corporate assets. Frequently the assets separately were more valuable than the corporate whole. That this lead to economic dislocation for the employees of the corporations rarely was considered by the men who planned and carried out the raids and takeovers.<br/><br/>Three films really got involved in this matter. They were WALL STREET, wherein ""Gordon Gecko"" (Michael Douglas)told an audience of stockholders that ""greed is good"" and that it might even save the United States! A more balanced version was presented by Danny DeVito as ""Larry the Liquidator"" in OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. <br/><br/>Then came this nice little fairy tale, mixing the world of Cinderella with the world of Dow Jones and some Freud. PRETTY WOMEN is probably the most popular of the three films, because Julia Robert's ""Vivian Ward"" humanizes the corporate raider ""Edward Lewis"" (Richard Gere) and thus they manage to save each other.<br/><br/>Economic realities remain in PRETTY WOMEN. Vivian, and her pal Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo) are hookers. They both are smarter than most but they are at the mercy of mean streets, mean Johns, and possibly mean pimps. Ironically they both work in Hollywood, only blocks away from the super rich. <br/><br/>One night Vivian is picked up by a man in a fancy sports car. It is Edward, who is planning a hostile take-over of a ship building empire owned by James Morse (Ralph Bellamy), with the assistance of his long-time legal aide Philip Stuckey (Jason Alexander). Edward has just left one of Stuckey's parties (Stuckey tries to be as ingratiating to the aloof Edward as he can - and mistakenly thinks he has succeeded in being so). Needing real release, Edward takes Vivian to his hotel suite. <br/><br/>What begins as a paid trick ends differently. FVivian is able to lighten Edward's spirits slowly so that he enjoys her for her company as well as the sex. Then the corporate raid gets so complex that Edward has to take an entire week to conclude it. Edward offers Vivian a chance to make a small fortune if she will stay with him for the week. After some bargaining (which she is good at) she agrees.<br/><br/>She learns that having money does not mean being acceptable. She is asked to get some fancy dinner clothing for a meeting with Morse and his grandson David (Alex Hyde-White). She tries to get the clothing at a snobbish store on Rodeo Drive, and is humiliated by the hostile staff. Subsequently she also has a brief problem with the manager of the hotel Barney Thompson (Hector Elizondo), but it clears up when members of the staff vouch for her being with Edward. Subsequently Barney turns out to be sympathetic to Vivian's needs for assistance for getting a decent dress and for learning proper eating etiquette. When Edward learns about the nastiness of the staff at the snobbish store he assists Vivian in getting more fancy clothing, and Vivian has a choice moment of revenge on the snobs.<br/><br/>Edward is soon planning how to force Morse to the wall, but Stuckey is curious about a type of distance in this business deal that is developing between Edward and the project, and (worse to Stuckey) between Edward and him. Edward is soon spending increasing times away to be with Vivian. While much of their time is between the sheets, they also are enjoying each other's company and she is teaching him to ease up and release his human side. <br/><br/>He explains to her that his business habits were based on a hatred of his father, a man who deserted his mother and Edward for another woman. After Edward's mother died, Edward went to work to make himself into the corporate raider he became, and his first great victory was the destruction of his father's company. He has been repeating this success ever since - but (despite one small victory due to therapy) he is not a happy person.<br/><br/>Vivian explains that she grew up in an unhappy poor family, and she left to try to improve herself, but she never graduated high school (despite being quite sharp). She also has always dreamed of one day finding a man who could rescue her - her image of him based on how her mother would lock her in a closet as punishment and her knight/prince would come to release her. <br/><br/>The fairy tale element in the film frequently hides the Freudian image of both leads - neither having had happy childhoods. We never learn of Vivian's relations with her Dad, but she and her mother were quite at odds. We know that Edward blamed his father for the death (soon after his father's desertion) of Edward's mother. Both are strong, capable figures, but both are desperately unhappy ones. <br/><br/>As the film heads to it's conclusions (there are several) we realize they should be together - neither will ever fully function well without the other (although they would both survive). But they have to overcome their equal repugnance at each other's lifestyle: Vivian has to get Edward away from constantly destroying his father again and again by corporate raiding (especially after she meets the Morses), and Edward keeps wanting to get Vivian off those mean streets - but keeps fumbling trying to overcome his dislike of her being a prostitute.<br/><br/>The film succeeds as the two characters break with their pasts. In the end corporate raiding and prostitution are discarded (not only by the main characters, but Vivian even pushes Kit towards cleaning up her act), and the last image of Edward and Vivian holding each other for support on an old building's fire escape. We know they'll make it."

All the prostitutes look like models--perfect health, clothes, teeth etc etc. Prostitution is shown as an OK lifestyle (that's how Roberts meets Gere) but just a little risky. Also everything looks perfect in this film--even the prostitutes apartment! It also ends with Roberts giving over herself to Gere totally. First of all is the implication that a woman NEEDS a man to survive and, second, she still is a prostitute--but just for him. That's a pretty disturbing message. The film plays lip service to occasionally telling us how horrible the career is--but everything they show is picture perfect. Also the film's R rating won't prevent kids from seeing it. I can imagine what they're gonna get from this. There's also a particularly sick sequence when Jason Alexander tries to rape her. THIS is a romantic comedy? END SPOILER!!!<br/><br/>That aside I DID like the film. The script is sharp (Roberts pulls off some great lines), there's a great soundtrack and even the supporting cast works. The two best are Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo (nominated for a Golden Globe). Gere and Roberts are excellent--they're both attractive people and have a great chemistry together. This is a little too long and I find the ultimate message troubling (and kind of sick)...but I'd be lying if I said I hated it. A 6."

","""Pretty Woman"" isn't too bad a picture for the very early 1990s.  Though it's two principals have been better, they have been an awful lot worse. They don't set the screen alight, but they have enough chemistry to just about sustain this two-hour Hollywood fairytale about a businessman and a hooker.<br/><br/>Richard Gere plays it straight as a New York broker who visits Los Angeles to finalise a hostile takeover, then gets lost in downtown LA when he borrows his friend's car to get to his plush hotel.  Stopping on a street corner, he asks for directions from a plucky prostitute (Julia Roberts) who talks her way into his car.  Taken with her gutsy charm, he asks her to keep him company for the week.  A strange and unlikely love affair quickly develops...<br/><br/>The script is a fairly straightforward boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back-again sort of affair.  The dialogue is filled with the standard characters and cliches for this sort of thing (including the usual sources of comic relief) but contains one or two interesting lines.  Gere makes a funny analogy between businessmen and hookers - 'We both screw people for money' and there is an intriguing observation about musical opera.<br/><br/>Richard Gere can be smug and vacuous onscreen sometimes, but happily that isn't the case here.  He is warm and restrained, and gives his character some credible depth.  Roberts, initially seen as an ugly duckling prostitute, quickly blossoms into a stunning beauty and her onscreen charm and winning smile are enough to carry her through.  In other roles, Hector Elizondo is a hoot as the camp hotel manager, and Jason Alexander is appropriately slimy as Gere's business attorney.  Laura San Giacomo, as Roberts' vulgar best friend, strikes the only bum note.<br/><br/>The film is well accentuated by a decent Nineties score that includes the title track ""Pretty Woman"" and the Roxette hit ""It Must Have Been Love"".<br/><br/>""Pretty Woman"" is a harmless, sentimental piece of fluff that should appeal to anyone who enjoys a good fairytale."

","Pretty Woman is one of those films that I've always known about since my childhood but never actually watched. I expected something boring but still wanted to see it just because I've known the iconic poster image so long. I'm also aware that there's some controversy around this movie, so I was quite curious to actually see what's the fuss all about.<br/><br/>All right, I must say that the movie was better than I expect in every possible sense. The comedy was funny, the romantic side was nice, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts both which aren't my favorites make pretty good performances here and there is great chemistry between them. Also many of the minor characters like the hotel employees are funny and memorable.<br/><br/>The accusations that this film makes prostitution look like a cool thing... I don't know about that. Any way you look at this movie it's a fantasy, a fairy tale. No one in their right mind should think that this film portrays real life. No more than, say, Home Alone is realistic. If anything, I think, Pretty Woman glorifies rich upper class lifestyle. But that's okay because that's what you want to see - - characters with a lot of money can afford to be sharp dressed and cool.<br/><br/>I like how the characters evolve along the way. Nothing super deep but it's enough to make an enjoyable movie experience. Romantic comedies are a genre that somehow in the very core is a bit dumb...but if you're ok with that, I think this is a pretty (how many times can I say pretty?) fun movie. For some reason I'm completely ok with watching ridiculously stupid action movies but find it a bit hard to admit that I also like romantic comedies sometimes.

","Pretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall, from a screenplay by J. F. Lawton. The film stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and features HÃ©ctor Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy (in his final performance), Laura San Giacomo, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles. The film's story centers on down-on-her-luck Hollywood prostitute Vivian Ward, who is hired by Edward Lewis, a wealthy businessman, to be his escort for several business and social functions, and their developing relationship over the course of her week-long stay with him. The film's title Pretty Woman is based on ""Oh, Pretty Woman"", written and sung by Roy Orbison.

"tdrish","7","1","1","5 June 2020"," It must have been love. But its over now.
","Edward Lewis seems to have it all. He's part of a rich but very troubled corporation, and his troubles keep on mounting, mainly internally then externally. He's not in any relationship, in fact, he doesn't want any relationship. Perhaps this is why hes chosen a prostitute as his escort for the week, someone who will work hard for him, and yet no one to answer to once the work is completed. Seems fair enough, as Edward has his hands and plates full with much other, complicated issues. Meet Vivian Ward! She's the prostitute hired to be his escort, and she earns her living off the streets, so she's not at all prepared for the champagne budget that she's about to be exposed to when she meets Edward. Nevertheless, she agrees to be his escort, with no talk and no concern of any foul play on the side. It doesn't take long before these two bond. Question is, will she make or break his company when they're both talk of the town. And what will become of them? Pretty Woman was, and still is, a stylish look at the final breath of air taken from the 80's. Yes, its a 1990 film, but trust me, the bulk, if not the entire film, was filmed in the 80's. It's beginning is a bit slow, almost even a bumpy road, but within the first 15 minutes, its on a smooth path, and its adorable themes are off the charts here. It's almost impossible not to smile, laugh, cry, or feel anything for these two, as they steal the show. I'm not much of a Richard Gere fan, and I'm not much of a Julia Roberts fan anymore either, but if you haven't seen Pretty Woman yet, you need to make time for this romance film tonight. The entire film pretty much gets its points across without violating much of anything, in fact, the content is so mild I wonder sometimes why it even got an R rating. Regardless, this is a fun, and very entertaining look at a romance between a rich guy and a broke, but hard working girl, and we watch their horizons get expanded, get crushed, and then finally, get resolved."

Now you may have gotten the innuendos and you either like them or think they are weak. But that is one of the examples of things you get from the movie.

She plays a prostitute who's ""employed"" by a rich playboy (Richard Gere) to pose as her girlfriend for a little while.

The movie spins this into a modern update with more relevant themes - mainly prostitution.<br/><br/>Ironically this is one of Roberts' first movies and the only one in which she has ever revealed any nudity. Sometimes actors deliver their finest performances before they develop egos and clauses in their contracts. She dares to go out on a limb here more so than she usually does - and the movie succeeds.<br/><br/>The direction is suitable, the soundtrack and stylings of the film are oh-so-eighties... overall it's just an entertaining, well-done romantic comedy that doesn't try to be anything it isn't.

While the combination of middle-aged lawyer Richard Gere and young hooker Julia Roberts is boring, it may be more worthy to pay attention to the details.

","""Pretty Woman"" is a love letter to all people out there who seek their ""fairy tale"". Just like Vivian (Roberts), everyone has his/her love story that reminds of Cinderella. And so this movie is a love letter to all those people out there. It is a great, funny and fabulous movie staring Richard Gere who is good as always and Julia Roberts who is stunning and gorgeous. You also get to see Costanza in the film - I mean Jason Alexander! Sorry, reflex. The movie has a great soundtrack that fits its tone of a romance movie in which I appreciate. Finally I think this is a great classic movie that all people with love tales should watch and have fun with, not only it was a hit back in the day but even today it's strong message can affect the viewers. If you have a love fantasy/tale then this is the perfect movie to watch."

","Hired by a rich businessman to be his date for a week, a prostitute has to work out if the businessman is serious about his romantic advances towards her in this romantic comedy that propelled Julia Roberts to fame. A popular movie when first released, 'Pretty Woman' has received some backlash over the years for its lack of realism and indeed one has to suspend disbelief at how kind-hearted both protagonists are. There is enough snappy dialogue though to keep things moving along; ""we both screw people for money"" Richard Gere comments at one point, while his observation that ""stores are never nice to people... they're nice to credit cards"" offers some unexpected social commentary for a lighthearted film like this is. The other big plus is the talented supporting cast. Hector Elizondo is delightful in a Golden Globe nominated role as a prim and proper hotel proprietor who gradually warms towards Roberts while Jason Alexander is a lot of fun as Gere's cunning lawyer. Realism aside, the biggest issue with the film is how little Roberts changes over the course of the film. This is no 'Pygmalion' or 'My Fair Lady' tale in which we see a noticeable difference in the protagonist as a result of her experiences. Still, it is a pleasant enough movie with some really funny moments (Roberts commenting on an opera) in between the clichés."

","I decided to see this film since many people were comparing this to ""Ghost"". Let's be reasonable, Ghost is a classic about eternal love which I liked much more than this one. Several IMDb users have said ""Pretty Woman"" is a touching story about a true love. I disagree with that; in my opinion, this film is very light and obviously fictional. Everyone in the story is gentle, loyal, kind and respectable, which I would like to be true, but unfortunately, this kind of society doesn't exist. Everyone would judge Richard Gere's character and Julia Roberts' would not be welcome in her boyfriend's group by any possibility. But, as far as it's Hollywood and this is a romantic comedy, I can deal with that. See this film only if you're really curious and if you want to really understand how ""Ghost"" is a perfect one. Otherwise, don't give this original yet fake romance a chance."

","Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is a businessman who specialises in taking over companies and then selling them off piece by piece. On a business trip in Los Angeles, he has gotten lost and takes on detour on Hollywood Boulevard, asking for directions. While he did so, he encountered a beautiful prostitute in Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) who is willing to assist him in getting to his destination.<br/><br/>The morning after, Edward hires Vivian to stay with him for a week as an escort for social events. As the week went, little by little, their feelings for each other grew. Along the way, Vivian has also being transformed in her appearance, which blew Edward away. But at the same time, the time spent with Vivian has also changed Edward's outlook on life which Edward's attorney of 10 years in Philip Stuckley (Jason Alexander) accuses her of. Philip tried to rape her before Edward arrived in time, punching his attorney and forcing him to leave with his belongings.<br/><br/>While Edward tended to Vivian and tried to convince her to stay with him, she refused and returns to the apartment she shares with her friend Kit (Laura San Giacomo), preparing to leave for San Francisco in the hopes of a better life than the one she is having. Edward then got into the car which took her home.<br/><br/>And instead of heading for the airport, he went to her apartment. Despite his fear of heights, he climbs up the fire escape with a rose clutch between his teeth and the intention to woo her. The limping from the limousine, climbing the outside ladder and steps...all are the visual metaphors of what Vivian had told Edward about her childhood fantasy. The knight on a white horse rescuing the princess from the tower. It ended with the two kissing on the fire escape.<br/><br/>It was the film to have said to really launch Julia Roberts's career, and that is not that bad considering it has always been considered as one of the best modern romantic comedy films.

","What Aleksander just said is ridiculous. Aleksander's talking about drug prostitution or extreme poverty prostitution. Of course MOST prostitutes are NOT drug-addicts, extremely poor, violent, traumatized and so on. And while not all are, SOME prostitutes of course are highly educated. Why they do prostitution? Well, because they think it's easy money, because they need extra money, or even for seeking adventures. Of course there are prostitutes like her. In fact, I know some. I might be biased since I'm not knowing as much drug prostitutes, perhaps Aleksander knows more I dunno.<br/><br/>Still, this movie is a VERY light romance comedy. It's not very deep or thought provoking, it's simply like a fairy tale just modern. Not REALLY bad, but not something to watch more than once either."

That's Hollywood for you, I suppose... How to commit a marketing bungle in one simple step.<br/><br/>Anyway, that hideous misjudgement is one of the only things that ""Pretty Woman"" gets wrong. It knows it's a fairytale and perfectly casts its own princess and Prince Charming to tell it. Most would agree that there's such a genuine innocence and sweetness about Julia Roberts when she smiles that it's easy to overlook how she's worlds away from the typical mold of a streetwalker.<br/><br/>Don't worry though, not everyone in this story is so gosh-darn wholesome. Sarcastic best friend Kit and snivelling little worm Stuckey are on hand to ground proceedings in reality at least a little bit. Kit in particular is a memorable confidante for our heroine, and makes me reflect that it's a hearty shame Laura San Giacomo never became a bigger star.<br/><br/>It's so gladdening to find a film that knows its characters so well that it can make us see past their profession and appreciate them as people.

","I think love stories work most effectively when the viewer can easily project themselves into one of the two romantic leads. If the film doesn't do this, the audience gets bored. What makes it easy to empathize with these characters is that it is a unique situation.<br/><br/>I like it when a film fully commits itself. It makes it easier to enjoy. I think it also makes the film more vulnerable to criticism. Marshall took quite a risk making such a light-hearted romance, but it paid off in the end. This film was very popular and it isn't hard to understand why.<br/><br/>
It was probably the shallow tenderness of the romance that made the film such a success, even though it is supported by a strong plot and all the elements of a conventional screenplay. The changes the characters go through are not what affect us the most. Vivian's adventure' and Edward's hospitality are what touched people."

Admittedly, the story isn't all that realistic but it doesn't bother you until after the film has ended. You watch and let it wash all over you.

Richard Gere is like the best man for all of these pretty women.<br/><br/>Suppose Richard Gere has a son in real life (which I think he does not), and when the time comes for his son to get married, Richard Gere would really admire his pretty young daughter-in-law. Or, if Richard Gere was my father (which he really is not, but I am just reasoning, no disrespect), he would be super happy if I got a sharp young girlfriend and/or wife and if I still become active to my studies. I would appreciate his quote and support and he would make me feel very special. He would let me deal with as many young ladies as I want to.

Lawton.<br/><br/>With Director Gary Marshall's ""Pretty Woman"", movies of the 1990's were off to a good start. This film was not a box-office smash, but when it was released on video and was subsequently shown on Cable TV, it gradually became a beloved romantic classic. Despite what anyone may think, ""Pretty Woman"" launched the careers of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, whose chemistry in this film is the stuff you'd be hard-pressed to find in today's Hollywood film pairings. With cinematography by Charles Minsky, which looks at Hollywood and Beverly Hills with a degree of authenticity, especially in the night scenes, and with pop hits on the soundtrack like the titular ""Pretty Woman"", ""Real Wild Child"", ""It Must Have Been Love"" and ""Show Me Your Soul"", this film is possibly the definition of a modern Hollywood love story, a kind of 1990's Cinderella. There's much to admire about this film. First the performances by the lead actors. Richard Gere portrays independently wealthy divorcée Edward Lewis who flies to Hollywood/LA/Beverly Hills on a business week where he is to buy a company. He meets Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) a street-walking prostitute who spends the week with him in a pent house suite in a luxurious hotel. She is to pose as a date and accompany him as he meets with the company guys. Vivian, who can barely afford to pay the rent, learns ""how the other half lives"" and through Richard discovers a world of ruthless business deals, hypocritical, class-conscious people and discrimination. Edward sheds his pride and learns how to really love another human being. The ""fairy tale"" aspect which is at the heart of ""Pretty Woman"" is a nice touch, but it's also responsible for its lack of credibility. In order to appreciate the film, you have to suspend disbelief. Vivian and Richard could not possibly fall in love in real life, and certainly not in the course of a single week. Even with this flaw, it's lovely to see them fall for each other (she did something she thought she'd never do to a client, kissed him on the mouth!!). I love it when Edward and Viv fly to San Francisco on his private plane where they see the opera ""La Traviata"", whose plot about a courtesan and a wealthy man in Paris mirrors Viv and Edward's own love story. Jason Alexander (better known as George Costanza from Seinfeld) portrays Phillip Stuckey, Edward's nasty lawyer. This was before Jason Alexander appeared on ""Seinfeld"" and his performance is something else. Obnoxious, mean-spirited, he even attempts to rape Vivian in a latter scene. Laura San Giacomo (""Maya"" on ""Just Shoot Me"") portrays the sassy Kit De Luca, Viv's prostitute girlfriend who is a real throwback to the personality of the 80's, which makes sense considering the film was being made in the late 80's and released in 1990. While some scenes are downright unrealistic, such as Vivian's following comment: ""When I was a girl, and when I misbehaved, and that was often, my mother would lock me up in the attic. I would pretend that I was a princess locked up in a tower by the evil queen. A knight in shining armor would come riding on a great horse, draw his sword and rescue me,""; some scenes contain slices of crude real life, especially among the rich, as the scene in which Vivian tries to purchase a gown at a store in the trendy Rodeo Drive. The sales ladies don't want her in the store on account of her being a hooker. This is exactly why we applaud not only when Vivian returns to the same store dressed in a sophisticated ""Sabrina"" type gown and this time humiliates the sales lady, but the ending in which she and Edward run off to live happily ever after. This is a wonderful film and a romantic classic that could have only come from the early 90's, which would see such other romantic films as ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991). This is Gary Marshall's best cinematic work and a sample of good 90's cinema."

She gets to live it up, and gets her share of the life without worry. Being in luxury is a must for the wealthy, getting the experience makes you think you can do it. For Vivian, she's a hooker, and everyone around her sees her as trouble. Edward(Gere) who shows her around treats her like a princess. Yes, she maybe a hooker, but she's not like the others who strung out on drugs, get beat up by their pimps, or even worse get killed by them as well. Vivian seems to be the one who wants out of the biz of turning tricks, but what she wanted the most is have the Cinderella ending most women want in their lives.

","This is one of the very few romantic comedies that work; first of all, it has likable, non-stereotypical characters. Second, the theme and basic idea is pretty good, original and interesting. Third, the humor rarely seems forced, but rather comes naturally. The basic idea that the film is based on is a prostitute meeting a business man, and them discovering how much they actually have in common, and how easy and obvious choice it is to be together, despite their differences, mainly in career choices. That theme is pretty original, and it works great in the film. The actors have great on-screen chemistry, and are, for the most part, well casted. The plot is good, and has a pretty good pace; you're rarely bored, even on when re-watching the movie for the fourth and fifth time. The acting is good. Roberts and Gere obviously understand their characters; Roberts perfectly captures the hooker ""mentality"", and Gere portrays his character believably. I also found various of the supporting characters to be very credible, well-acted and interesting. I actually would have liked if Laura San Giacomo's character, Kit De Luca, would have had more screen-time than she did, as I found her to be one of the better and more interesting members of the supporting cast. The film, of course, has its share of romance, and ""romantic"" scenes and such, but don't let this discourage you, the male viewer who could care less about romance in movies, from watching it; the film has more comedy and humor than it has romance, and the comedy is usually entertaining. The humor is pretty good, though I guess the whole ""main character experiences a totally new world for him/her"" scenario is kind of worn out, by now. It doesn't feel too ""been there, done that"" here, though. The film made it sufficiently interesting and entertaining to watch Roberts experience how it is to be rich, or, at least, be with someone who is rich. Not much else to say... the soundtrack is pretty good too. All in all, a quite entertaining and worthwhile romantic comedy, that is worth watching, even for people who usually loathe romance in movies(like me). I recommend it to pretty much anyone who enjoys romantic comedies, comedies in general and fans of any of the actors. This is probably also a good movie to get for guys whose girlfriends demand to see a romantic comedy, and they want to be able to sit through it too. 7/10"

","Only in Hollywood can they take something like prostitution and turn it into some fairy tail cheesy story staring over rated actress Julia Roberts. So what do we have here? A whore played by Julia (who resembles nothing like a true prostitute) is payed for a night with a rich guy played by Richard Gere who could probably pay any woman to spend a night or weekend with him but no he picks up a street walker instead. It could have been a charming story or a little more serious and intelligent but as with most Hollywood movies in the last 10 to 15 years it is out of touch with reality. I don't know but prostitution is to me a last sign of desperation by women who have nothing more to lose or need it to support a drug addiction. The women in this movie who are suppose to be prostitutes seem all too happy and cheerful to be in their position. Of course they fall in love and go walking off into the sunset....Lets get real. Hey ladies of the night keep working the streets because you never know when some rich guy might come along."

","Roberts isn't the only pretty thing here, the lead actor has to be pretty, too, for this to work. The Cinderella/Prince mirage is stretched thin, considering Gere did his own famous turn as a prostitute.<br/><br/>This is all about Marshall's camera being 'at the beck and call' of the stars -- what else can you expect from a TV director? -- every shot is aimed at flattery. This aspect really couldn't be more venal.<br/><br/>Thematically, this is ""My Fair Lady"", without the wager. It adds to the illusion of 'happenstance'. The subplot of the business deal tends toward ""Local Hero"" with the ironic last minute change of heart.<br/><br/>There was a huge opportunity to make something self-referentially rich out of this -- 'part of the soul' if you believe the writer's airy proclamations -- within the performance of Verdi's ""La Traviata"".

","Let me start this review with a question (THAT'S RIGHT A QUESTION 'EMPIRE' MAGAZINE!) and one that I think might change the way that you view this film in the future. Let's just say that you're Richard Gere in this film, and you have so much money that you can do anything you want would you:<br/><br/>A) Pay Julia Roberts, a women who I believe to be possessed by something similar to that slug monster from 'The Hidden' to be your escort for some business events, or:<br/><br/>B) Use your wealth to have either Famke Janssen or Whoopi Goldberg cloned to act as your escort for some business events?<br/><br/>The correct answer is B. why the hell would you pay Julia Roberts to act as an escort? For a start she's evil and secondly she's possessed by something unnatural that might jump out of her face at any moment. If you were meeting Bill Gates at a posh dinner party and an evil slug exploded out your 'girlfriends' face do you honestly think he'd do business with you? Duh No!<br/><br/>But imagine turning up at a posh dinner party in an exclusive restaurant with Whoopi Goldberg? That'd be great! She'd be like all kooky and funny, making all the posh people look like morons.<br/><br/>Lord Windford: 'I say, can you pass the baked beans please Ms Goldberg.'<br/><br/>Whoopi Goldberg: 'With a name like Windford, I think you've had enough beans already!'<br/><br/>HA! Take THAT the British class system! But I bet you'd expect that the whole place would be all stuffy with dull classical music playing and the clinking of cutlery. WRONG! Because wherever Whoopi goes she gets all the people together and shows them that what they're doing can be fun. 'C'mon! We can really rock this place!' she'll shout as she cranks up the sound system with some kickin' tunes (probably Level 42).<br/><br/>Empire magazine apparently isn't taking on any new film reviewers right now, or so they tell me. I bet if Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino wrote to them asking to be film reviewers they'd employ them in a flash. Actually if Dr Stephen Hawking wrote in and asked to be on their staff they'd trample over each other to get him to sign a contract. Did they do that with me? No. Just be honest Empire, you can't handle my cutting edge film reviews and you know I'd make the rest of you're staff look like dullards, even with Dr Stephen Hawking and his theory about science.<br/><br/>And if they employed me they wouldn't have to put any ramps for wheel chairs in their buildings because I don't use a wheel chair like Hawking does. Quick question: Has Dr Stephen Hawking had any of his film reviews published by IMDb? Answer: No, he hasn't and I've had loads (except for the 'Erotic Witch Project 2: Book of Seduction' one)! In your face Hawking!<br/><br/>Now bearing in mind I've already pointed out this film's MAJOR flaw (that it stars Julia Roberts rather than Famke or Whoopi) I expect you're thinking; 'well, there's really no point in me watching this film' and you'd be right. Don't watch it."

","""The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that?"" - Vivian
Every story has two sides. Every coin has two Parts. Every Emotion has two ways. This movie was all about emotions, depth, love and most importantly giving back what you have taken.
If you have fallen in love with this movie, you will jump in it repeatedly.
I am a crazy fan of ROMCOMs and Julia Roberts is the queen, I guess. The chemistry between the handsome Richard and Vivian is simply marvellous.
Let's move on to characters.
Vivian: a hooker by force but lately by choice. From meeting Richard to their last kiss, she performed her character amazingly. Her dialogue delivery was just awesome. She is the girl dreaming of her prince to come to rescue her from the tower. OH MY GOD, the fantasy! When she completed the deal with Richard and went back to her apartment, I have seen the pain of leaving in her eyes. She was careless but took care of Kit De Luca. She was a hooker but fallen in love with Richard. She was a true example of falling in love madly. Vivian: The Perfect-Pretty-Woman.
Richard: Ah Richard! Richard!
You the Man! You have done a remarkable act. I just love the Scene in Opera when he said to Vivian ""People's reactions to opera the first time they see, it is very dramatic; they either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul.""
The person who treats you like Cinderella, the one who loves you like you are the ONE AND ONLY, the one who is willing to shower his each and every penny upon you, the one who gives you wings, the one who trusts you with everything, the one who is ready to fulfil your fairytales is the one. He is THE ONE.<br/><br/>""Welcome to Hollywood! What's your dream? Everybody comes here; this is Hollywood, land of dreams. Some dreams come true, some don't; but keep on dreamin' - this is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so keep on dreamin'.""<br/><br/>You got a dream. Keep on dreaming! DREAM BIG!"

","I do not like romantic movies. It is just a matter of personal preference. That does not mean that there aren't some great ones (""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" first comes to mind). But ""Pretty woman"" is not one of them.
Cinematography is nothing special, dialog is typical, occasionaly funny, character development is mostly done through characters talking about themselves... Everything screams mediocrity.
The premise is typical 90s daydreaming. A rich guy and a dream girl have sex and fall in love. He provides for her and protects her and she in turn makes him a better person. All in a week. In other words: a fairytale (even the starts mentioning fairytales near the end). It is all very cheesy and unrealistic.
Julia Roberts character is a prostitute, mostly so that the movie has some conflict (which is poorly handled). She is a good actress but she is too classy for this role. And yes the movie makes a point of that fact but it is poorly done (she cries after her FIRST opera). But the chemistry between her and Richard Geere is rather good and the best thing about this film, even though their relationship makes little sense. For example he starts to care for people instead of using them but it feels unnatural and sudden because she did not do anything to make him do so.
In the end the leading actors saved this movie from an unfavourable grade. Not good, not bad,somewhere in between. 6/10 from me."

Julia Roberts took the world by storm in this role and immediately became a household name and hasn't looked back since.<br/><br/>This comes at the highest recommend possible. All the side characters are lovable, the story engaging, the music is memorable, and the fantasy elements are enticing. It's charming, touching, funny, and at times sad and poignant.

We have the beautiful young actress who is pretty normal, perhaps more normal than your average woman of her age. Along comes handsome Richard Gere. He takes on the task of cleaning her up. He has all the money he needs to do whatever he wants as it regard this young woman. Of course, she is a bit coarse, but she is a little hard to believe. There seems to be no regret or disdain for where she comes from. She also seems to be an independent contractor. Anyway, it is a formulaic love story that we all know will come to a proper conclusion. Roberts is absolutely beautiful. Gere was at the peak of his marquee good looks. This really set Roberts off as a leading lady. It's a fun movie."
"StevePulaski","5","1","2","27 October 2015"," Basic cable entertainment and little else
","Garry Marshall's Pretty Woman is the kind of film that etches itself in the zeitgeist and the contemporary facet of acclaimed romantic comedies for reasons that almost entirely allude me. This is a film that tries to capture the essence of human interest by focusing on a character in an uglier situation than most of her colleagues, who all seemed to get peppier, cuter romantic comedies with more uplifting narratives and occupations. Pretty Woman is a film that is tries to capture a brewing romance in a more difficult situation, but it's too busy searching for the next wickedly transformative, convenient circumstance for its characters and attempting to tie such a difficult situation together so sentimentally to really function as a compelling or original story.<br/><br/>It isn't, however, without any merit. Thankfully, despite a rather lackluster narrative that is predictable to a fault, we do get some lively performances that remind us why romantic comedies can occasionally be charming. The most commendable and involved performance of the hour is from Julia Roberts, who plays Vivian Ward, a Hollywood hooker who works the streets with her close friend, rounding up clients and avoiding mistreatment from ruthless pimps in order to try and make whatever money she can in the moment. While she's working late one night, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a wealthy businessman, is driving around town lost and in search of Beverly Hills. A simple stop for directions from Vivian turns into him picking her up and having her spend the night at his beautiful apartment suite, where he, in turn, expresses disillusionment over his current place in life following a divorce. With that, we also learn Vivian's rough-go of life and how her existence is now predicated on self-reliance and the resistance to trust anyone.<br/><br/>This is a match made in film Heaven; it's questionable if this kind of circumstance would occur on the streets of Hollywood, or anywhere in the United States, but per the rules and logic of Hollywood romantic comedies, plausibility doesn't need to be a contributing factor to the story. This film exists for those who have never lived a day in the life of Vivian to claim how difficult being a stripper must be, and to regard Vivian and Edward's relationship as one that, despite the likelihood of it being doomed in real life, inspires grins and laughs along their way of trying to remain loyal and emotionally honest to one another.<br/><br/>As stated, Roberts commands most of her scenes in this film, not only because she is knockout beautiful in both a loud, red dress or more conservative duds, but also because of her ability to be comedic, sarcastic, dramatic, and emotionally convincing, sometimes throughout one whole scene. Gere is a more plain presence, largely because his character is more bent on squarish principles rather than making a splash, as Roberts' Vivian does with many of her scenes. Their chemistry is about as believable as this unbelievable setup could allow for, and thanks to screenwriter J. F. Lawton's recognition of this story's dark roots, turning it into a darker version of Cinderella in some sense, there's at least an added layer of human interest in the film.<br/><br/>While Pretty Woman is certainly harmless and easily classifiable as a feel-good movie, it's a film with little merit outside of its leading female performance and a few solid one-liners. The premise, despite being largely predicated off of foreseeable moments of wit, heartbreak, misunderstandings, and miscommunications, feels the need to extend itself shortly past the two hour mark. For a film that doesn't feature enough scenes involving raw emotions being exchanged between Vivian and Edward, nor any real kind of conversations that predicate themselves upon traditional conversation patterns, it sure feels the need to exhaust its plot in a way that alludes to the idea that it does. This is fine, basic-cable entertainment, something it has turned into over the last decade, but simply little more than that.<br/><br/>Starring: Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Directed by: Garry Marshall."
"lee_eisenberg","4","1","2","25 March 2015"," Hank Azaria gets his first speaking role in a questionable look at LA's underbelly
","Garry Marshall probably isn't the most recognizable name in entertainment. He created ""Happy Days"" (and cast his sister Penny in a supporting role) before turning to directing. After directing a few movies, he made a splash with ""Pretty Woman"", released 25 years ago this month. Considering that it focuses on a streetwise hooker who changes the life of a Gordon Gekko type, you'd think that it's something cool, right? <br/><br/>If only. In reality, prostitutes face severe hardships, and it's unlikely that a corporate raider would change this easily (we're talking about the sorts of people who carried out hostile takeovers in the '80s). It has to be one of the most predictable movies ever. It probably wants to see itself as an indictment of rich snobs, as the Beverly Hills crowd refuses to acknowledge the hooker.<br/><br/>As for the cast. Everyone knows Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Garry Marshall often casts Héctor Elizondo. Ralph Bellamy played one of the Duke brothers in ""Trading Places"" (a more realistic look at big business). Judith Baldwin replaced Tina Louise in the ""Gilligan's Island"" movies. You might recognize Larry Miller from Christopher Guest's movies. Lesser known is that the movie features Hank Azaria - who had recently started providing voices on ""The Simpsons"" - in his first speaking role (Garry Marshall later appeared as a guest voice on ""The Simpsons"").<br/><br/>All in all, it's not an impressive movie. The prostitute with a heart of gold is the oldest cliché in the book. They should have stuck with the darker screenplay that they had planned early in production. Julia Roberts starred in too many romantic comedies before she appeared in ""Erin Brockovich"". I'd like to see a mash-up of ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Army of Darkness""."

She earned in this movie an Academy Award and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.Her presence definitely raised the level of this movie from other romantic comedies.Keeping Pretty Woman afloat throughout is the buoyant direction of Garry Marshall.It was widely successful at the box office, and it became one of the highest moneymakers of 1990.

","Pretty Woman (1990) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A billionaire (Richard Gere) gets lost on his way to Beverly Hills and asks a prostitute (Julia Roberts) for directions. They spend the night together and then the hooker gets a business offer: spend the week with him for $3,000. While the deal starts off simply as a business one it slowly starts to change when they begin to have feelings for one another. This film will always have a nostalgic place in my heart as it was one of the first movies I watched by myself at the theater. I must have been somewhere over ten-years-old and I think I ended up watching this thing five times. It's been at least a decade since I last watched it and I'm happy that the film really lived up to my fond memories of it. It's somewhat strange watching the movie today knowing that Roberts turned into a major star because there was something special seeing her character back when it was just a character being played by a rather unknown actress. She certainly has the charm and smile that makes this film work so well. Another key is that the movie, even though it deals with hookers, is very innocent in nature. The film has an innocent charm running through it where it comes off like a fairy tale more than anything else. The film has a very good soundtrack, which is another plus as is Marshall's direction, which manages to handle the comedy and some of the more dramatic moments very well. The real key though are the performances by Gere and Roberts. The two have wonderful charm together and you can't help but believe them in both of their roles. Gere was certainly made to play a role like this as he certainly has the looks that women want but he also has the charm. The charm he brings to his character is what really stands out. Roberts also has that charm and seeing the two of them work together certainly is magic. It's also nice seeing Ralph Bellamy in his few scenes. I think the final act could have been trimmed by several minutes since we know what's going to happen but other than that this is a highly entertaining and charming film."

"nycritic","8","1","2","9 March 2007"," Romance as Fantasy
","Garry Marshall is something of an anomaly in the film business: his movies tend to eschew the extreme, ""quien-es-mas-macho"" bravado found in the works of many of his peers (Martin Scorsese and David Mamet, to name a few), and in turn they embrace the type of sentimental maudlin that sums up the term ""chick-flick"" with pride. And he's clearly getting away with it -- the only other high-profile directors to sculpt their entire careers on the plight of the female sex have been Pedro Almodovar, Douglas Sirk, and George Cukor, all in their distinctive directing styles. All the rest have occasionally dabbed in high-powered drama, but never as soapy and drenched in Lifetime television glitter as Garry Marshall has.<br/><br/>PRETTY WOMAN continued his venture into the world of opposites: here he goes for a modern take on MY FAIR LADY, itself a version of PYGMALION, and amps up the fairytale aspect to eleven until there is really nowhere else to take the concept, already convoluted to begin with. Richard Gere plays a high-powered executive who crosses paths with (the unrealistically named) Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts in her first starring role) and takes her in as his companion (i. e. escort, kept lady, etc.). This of course comes with his re-imaging of her: he gives her a massive wardrobe, polishes her act, and transforms her into a quasi-society woman. It doesn't come with a few set of complications, one involving Jason Alexander's lecherous character, but these are less of interest to the focus of the story, already deep into establishing what Roberts and Gere are to each other.<br/><br/>PRETTY WOMAN has become a classic in its own right even when there are people who hate it and call it dated, or downright misogynistic due to the fact that purportedly it is ""telling"" people that ""a woman needs a man to survive."" I for one, don't think so. It would mean that every movie made in the vein of the aforementioned MY FAIR LADY or PYGMALION is a blast against women who are objectified to the point where they aren't even human anymore, and that is plain ridiculous. PRETTY WOMAN is romantic fantasy, no more no less, and is meant to be enjoyed as such. Nothing that happens here would happen in real life -- as a matter of fact, big-named male execs and celebrities have been on the wrong side of publicity once their liaisons with hookers have been publicized. Vivian isn't even a true person, but Julia Roberts plays her as if she were made of sheer velvet and longing and innocence. To see her getting her revenge on the snobbish women of that Rodeo Drive store is a hoot -- because we've rooted for this character. Again, good storytelling and characterization made into a commercial smash."

","""Pretty Woman"" came at the end of the decade that gave us the ""greed is good"" mentality and the concept of the yuppie, so it is perhaps fitting that the male lead, Edward Lewis, is a ruthless millionaire businessman. Lewis specialises in taking over companies, splitting them up and selling off the profitable parts. While in Los Angeles to conclude a deal, he gets lost while driving in his car and stops to ask directions from an young woman named Vivian, who just happens to be a prostitute. Edward's work involves a good deal of socialising, but being divorced and having recently split up with his girlfriend, he has no female partner to accompany him. Much taken with the attractive Vivian, he offers her $3000 to be his escort for the week. Of course, this being a romantic comedy, they end up falling in love with one another. <br/><br/>As has often been pointed out, that is not a realistic story line. Indeed, this film has been criticised for its lack of realism, but romantic comedies, especially that sub-category of the genre dealing with love between people of different social backgrounds, are not generally supposed to be exercises in kitchen-sink realism. Contrary to what we might have been led to believe by ""Maid in Manhattan"", for example, most Republican senators (or Democrat ones for that matter) are not married to Latina chambermaids. Nor (pace Richard Curtis in ""Notting Hill"") do female Hollywood superstars generally find the love of their life working in small bookshops in West London. It is a historical fact that no British Prime Minister has ever married his tea-lady (not even Palmerston, whose appetite for working-class girls was legendary), so it seems that Mr Curtis got it wrong in ""Love, Actually"" as well. Like ""Maid in Manhattan"" and ""Love, Actually"", ""Pretty Woman"" is a modern dress version of all those old fairy tales about the poor girl who falls in love with a prince. <br/><br/>The film has also been criticised by certain moralists for giving an excessively romantic and glamorised picture of prostitution. Certainly, it is not exactly realistic to suggest that every prostitute is a beautiful, healthy, carefree Julia Roberts lookalike who ends up marrying a handsome millionaire. On the other hand, the moralists' preferred position on prostitution- that every prostitute is a drug-addicted disease-ridden crack whore living in squalid poverty who ends up either dying of AIDS or being murdered by a modern Jack the Ripper- is equally unrealistic. Vivian is an example of the ""tart with a heart"", a stock character who has been part of the literary tradition going back at least as far as ""La Dame aux Camellias"" (when Vivian and Edward go to the opera together, it is to see ""La Traviata"", based upon Dumas's story) and part of the cinematic tradition since at least the sixties, when film censorship began to be relaxed. (Think, for example, of Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""). <br/><br/>Julia Roberts's performance in this film was reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn in another way. Hepburn had the ability to seize hold of any film and, through the force of her personality, make it entirely her own so that one just cannot imagine any other actress in the leading role. That is just what Roberts does here. Vivian may be a tart, but Roberts makes her so lovable, playful and full of life that the audience instantly fall in love with her. (The use of the Christian name ""Vivian"" may have been deliberately significant on the part of the scriptwriters- it is derived from the same Latin root, meaning ""living"", that gives us the word ""vivacious""- the word that best sums up Roberts's character). There are thematic links with two other Hepburn films, ""Sabrina"" and ""My Fair Lady"", which also feature poor girls who fall in love with wealthy men. (Vivian is seen watching a fourth Hepburn film, ""Charade"", on television). The relationship between Vivian, who gradually learns social graces under Edward's tutelage, parallels that between Eliza and Higgins in ""My Fair Lady"". <br/><br/>In this film, made when she was a promising starlet, Roberts plays a woman in love with a high-status man. By the time she made ""Notting Hill"" nine years later, she had become an established star, and the roles were reversed; her character, Anna, is the high-status woman in love with a man from a humbler background. In both films, however, it is the lower-status character who is mentally stronger. Anna is beautiful and successful but insecure. Similarly, Richard Gere's Edward has been immensely successful in business and outwardly appears confident and self-possessed. Underneath, however, he is also insecure, going through a crisis of conscience about his dubious business ethics and worried by the fact that he makes his money through financial sleight of hand, without ever producing anything tangible. He admits that his main psychological motivation has been anger against his father, from whom he was estranged. There is a sub-plot involving Edward's attempts to take over a family-owned shipbuilding firm; he gradually comes to respect the elderly patriarch who has built that company up, and there is a suggestion that he has come to see the old man as a substitute father. <br/><br/>""Pretty Woman"" may be an unrealistic, cliché-ridden story, a fairy-story in modern dress, but, like ""Notting Hill"", it does have some psychological depth. Moreover, it was so well done, and Roberts and Gere both play their parts so well, that I couldn't help enjoying it. 7/10"

","Usually, I am in two minds when I view any film. I want to be entertained, but I want to be entertained in a fashion that doesn't completely disrespect reality or my intelligence. Unfortunately, films like Pretty Woman, and pretty much everything Julia Roberts has ever been in, do both.<br/><br/>Granted, I have been prejudiced against fairy tales for a long time, but that was only through learning that they were, in actuality, religious stories from ancient, more respectable cultures that the Christian menace had stolen, rewritten, and basically stripped of all their significance. Unfortunately, Pretty Woman takes this even further by taking a modern ""fairy tale"" and stripping it of even the most vague connection with reality.<br/><br/>Every adolescent boy has a fantasy about meeting the proverbial ""hooker with a heart of gold"", but those who have experienced it in real life will always tell you that it always ends in tears. Anyone who thinks that a woman can work the streets for as long as is implied in the character while retaining the youthful appearance of Roberts and remaining disease-free needs help. Seriously.<br/><br/>So is there a redeeming feature to this turkey? Well, Laura San Giacomo puts in a reasonable performance with the limited time she has, but she has appeared in much better films both before and since. Aside from that, it's just another example of Julia Roberts phoning in her performance with an expression on her face that conjures up mental images of a brain-dead chipmunk. And yet they decided to give her the Oscar in 2000 rather than Connie Nielsen. I think the rumours that the entire Academy just picks a winner at random and never watches films at all are actually true."

","This film catapulted Julia Roberts to superstardom and with good reason. The film itself is a light but entertaining romantic comedy about a wealthy and unemotional corporate raider (Richard Gere) and a flamboyant hooker (Julia Roberts).  The story isn't that original, being a variation on the `love on the wrong side of the tracks' theme.  However, it is full of charming and funny moments and Roberts' audacious effervescence is the perfect contrast to Gere's impassive macho persona.  The film had enormous popular appeal and surprised everyone, grossing $178 million in the U.S. and $463 million worldwide, establishing Roberts as one of the most bankable stars in a generation.<br/><br/>At only 21, Roberts was a fresh talent with sexy girl-next-door looks who showed she could light up the screen with her acting.  With the guidance of veteran sitcom director Garry Marshall (`The Odd Couple', `Happy Days', `Mork and Mindy', `Murphy Brown'), she was transformed from a tall and pretty model type into a delightful romantic figure with an extraordinary sense of comic timing who earned a best actress nomination for her performance.<br/><br/>The new DVD includes a good deal of footage that was left out of the theatrical release, and the commentary by Garry Marshall is rich in interesting trivia about the production.  For instance, he tells how Julia Roberts was so nervous about her first nude scene with Richard Gere that she broke out in hives, and they spent the entire day applying calamine lotion and makeup all over her to hide the blotches.  Also, the now famous scene where Gere snaps the lid of the jewelry case on her fingers was not intended to be in the film.  Marshall instigated a prank because Julia was dragging and he wanted to wake her up.  So, he told Gere to impishly snap the lid when she went to touch the necklace, and her reaction was so delightful that they kept it.<br/><br/>This is a fun film that is worth seeing again now that it has been released on DVD.  I rated it an 8/10.  Though it is ridiculously implausible, it is enchanting and amusing throughout.  It is also an excellent look at Julia Roberts' early work, when she only earned $300,000 rather than $20 Million per film."

","About this movie enough to say one thing: ""It's standard"", in the broadest sense of the word. The standard of the love of melodrama. Sample of the lyric comedy. The standard of harmonious combination of literary text and visual image. The measure of a whole generation of movies of the 1990s: Indecent proposal, Sleepless in Seattle, French kiss, You've got mail, Notting Hill, etc. <br/><br/>After receiving the baton from the cinema of the 1980s, in which the romantic side of the relationship was imbued with a hint of nostalgic sadness, film made by Garry Marshall sets a new vector in understanding when and from which arises the situation of attraction between a man and a woman. <br/><br/>The fact of how at first the Director had planned to remove social drama (millionaire + prostitute addicted to drugs), and then was forced to switch to lyric comedy, is well known. Thanks to this fact approach to the conflict between a man and a woman remained as a real drama. For example. The film is saturated with a large number of contrasts: a pessimistic smart hero and an optimistic beautiful heroine, a world of pure luxury and a dark place of depravity, a large planned business and a small random freelance. There are a lot of different details in the cultural area of the film. Every detail is like a little story. It has its place, its important phrase, its directorial promise. <br/><br/>Prostitution is not the easiest way of getting money. We know it from the first minute of the film, when Vivian sees the body of her friend-hooker in the street. To further this thought is repeated in different ways. There are many similar details in the life of the heroine and in the fate of ""Ladies with camellias"". Basically, a comedy is an easy movie. The audience laughs when they see the problems of the hero. But when we see the Vivian's problems, we want to help her. <br/><br/>The vulnerability and optimism of the heroine is strong parts of her image. Vivian appears before Edward as the cute baby and as the fury, as the plain man and as the posh woman, as the nerdy and as the neophyte. Russian writer Ivan Bogdanovich said: ""My Darling! You are very beautiful in any clothes"". The phrase reflects the Vivian's attractiveness. For me, she is not Cinderella (A lot of people think so). For me, she is a sort of ""mistress into maid"". She is beautiful, playful, assertive and wise every day."

","Pretty Woman is a modern day Cinderella. The film uses modern issues like sex, drugs, and prostitution. Pretty Woman follows the Cinderella story outline in a modern way that not many other stories that follow this outline are able to achieve. Pretty Woman has the elements that make up the story of Cinderella, while also keeping it original. Although critics may say that Pretty Woman does not have what it takes to be a Cinderella story, Pretty Woman is an original take on a classics story and contains the importance of first impressions, riches-to-rags story, a male savior who brings out the inner beauty of the heroine, and a conflict a past life; elements that are needed for a true Cinderella story. Although many viewers thought it was a scandalous film promoting a poor lifestyle, I think it was a love story.<br/><br/>When it comes to a princess who started from rags to riches, Cinderella is the one most people would say comes to mind. Cinderella starts off as a lowly servant for her stepmother and stepsisters. She is treated like someone who is very worthless and is ridiculed throughout her entire existence at home. In comparison Vivian also starts out in rags. She is a prostitute on the streets of Beverly Hills giving away her body and virtue for men who want sexual favors in return for money. Prostitutes are seen as objects, not human beings, and the woman who did this treat themselves like objects. Nothing can be seen as more lowly and awful. Both characters, Cinderella and Vivian, are given an opportunity for much more than what they start out with. They meet a man who has all the opportunities in life and gives them experiences that are able to show off their true worth. For Cinderella, she showed that she was just more than a poor house-servant but that she a princess. Similarly with Vivian, she proved that she was a true lady of modern times and someone who wanted to know more than just being a prostitute.<br/><br/>Overall, this romantic comedy is a classic; a Cinderella story from the eighties. This film will go down in history along with all the other Cinderella films!"
"disinterested_spectator","6","1","3","23 January 2015"," Allaying Our Concerns about Disease
","Because ""Pretty Woman"" intends to be a modern version of ""Cinderella"" and ""Pygmalion,"" with an allusion to the title character being a princess who is rescued from a wicked queen by a knight on a white horse thrown in to boot, it hardly seems appropriate to criticize this fairy tale as being unrealistic. Suffice it to say that it is far-fetched that a rich, handsome man like Edward would not find the right woman until he met Vivian, a streetwalker who is so perfect that she even likes the opera. Perfect for him, that is, not for me. My perfect woman likes watching movies, and I leave the ones that like going to the opera to men like Edward.<br/><br/>Though this movie made no pretense about being realistic, yet there is one reality too stark to be ignored, and that is disease. Once upon a time, a man in a movie could marry a prostitute, and the audience would accept this without thinking about her having some kind of sexually transmitted disease. For example, we never worried while watching ""Stagecoach"" (1939) when the Ringo Kid (John Wayne) decided to marry Dallas (Claire Trevor), who was a whore with a heart of gold. Because venereal disease was something people rarely spoke of, especially in the movies, they rarely thought about it either.<br/><br/>But today, we live in a world where it is impossible to think about sex without also thinking about getting an STD, especially if it is sex with prostitutes. And therefore, it was necessary for this movie to assure the audience that Vivian was in good health. So we are not surprised when Vivian says to Edward, when they first meet, that she is safe: ""Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I am probably safer."" Maybe prostitutes normally say that sort of thing to their customers, maybe not. I wouldn't know. But if it sounds a little forced and artificial, we accept this bit of dialogue as necessary to keep us from thinking about disease when they have eventually have sex. The movie could not afford to rest content with this one reference to condoms, however. To drive the point home, Vivian later produces her rainbow assortment of condoms for Edward to pick from.<br/><br/>But still, they are not quite ready for sex. That is, we in the audience are not quite ready for them to have sex. Apparently we need a few more assurances. Therefore, in a subsequent scene, Vivian tells Edward that she does not kiss on the mouth. She says this is for emotional reasons: ""Kit's always saying to me, 'Don't get emotional when you turn tricks.' That's why no kissing. It's too personal."" So, later in the movie, when they do start kissing, we know that they are getting emotionally involved. But the real reason for her having this restriction on kissing is so that we know there has been absolutely no exchange of bodily fluids, not even saliva, with any of her past customers.<br/><br/>In a movie about sex, we are not surprised if there is a bathtub scene, especially one in which both the man and the woman are in the tub together. But as there are two bathtub scenes in this movie, we have to wonder if the purpose is more than just erotic, if they are meant to make us think of Vivian as clean. This is not to say that taking a bath would act as a prophylactic against the transmission of disease. This is more about the association of ideas than logic. The cleanliness associated with bathing is supposed to support our belief that Vivian is sexually clean as well.<br/><br/>But the scene that really shows the extent to which this movie wants to assure the audience that she is safe to have sex with is the dental floss scene. Let's face it. Most people do not floss during a date. I suppose a woman might, because she can carry the floss around in her purse. But even so, there is normally no need to have a scene involving personal hygiene in a movie, unless, of course, personal hygiene is important for some reason. As with the bathing, flossing will do nothing to prevent the transmission of venereal disease, but the movie is trying to suggest to us that any woman who flosses during a date must be so clean she could not possibly have AIDS, herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, or crabs.<br/><br/>Still, under normal circumstances, if a woman decided to floss her teeth on a date, she would close the bathroom door, and her date would not dream of just walking in. But if he did interrupt her while flossing, she would simply stop what she was doing to see what he wanted. She would not hide the floss as if it were something shameful or embarrassing. But the purpose of Vivian's hiding the floss is so that there can be a big dramatic scene and discussion about it, one which cannot escape the attention of the audience, much in the way that her display of condoms for Edward to pick from drove home the point in a way that could not be missed either.<br/><br/>So, with the condoms, the free clinic, a ban on kissing, a couple of baths, and some dental floss, the audience can finally relax and quit worrying about whether Vivian has a disease, even if the opera she and Edward went to see was ""La Traviata,"" a story about a courtesan who dies of tuberculosis."

","I now had the opportunity to see many of the so called romantic classics from the '30s onwards, and am surprised to find that this movie is one of the best amongst them.<br/><br/>The movie has all the elements of romantic movies except for a tragic ending which I find unnecessary. And out of all, this one is one of the most detailed and perfectly executed. It also invites us into the world of super rich in a stylized way that makes for a perfect fantasy.<br/><br/>I'm also impressed with Richard Gere in looking so good in his role. He was stunningly good looking as Edward, and had almost a teenager like quality in his looks. Maybe I should thank the HD technology for allowing me to notice so much details that I didn't notice when I first saw this movie.<br/><br/>One of the best movie made, and certainly one of the top 10 romantic movies of all time."

","Bright combination of the Cinderella heroine and the modern makeover comedy, with happily-ever-after trimmings. I know people who watch ""Pretty Woman"" every time TNT broadcasts it (commercials and all); even though they may already have the film on disc, they stop everything to tune in again. Why? It must be the unspeckled charm of a fresh-faced Julia Roberts before she turned dramatic, Richard Gere before he became self-serious, and the whole knight-in-shining-armor bit before every other studio tried to duplicate it. Harmless fluff has a Los Angeles prostitute hired by a wealthy businessman to be his escort to society functions; naturally, his partners and friends are anxious to know who this vivacious girl is, but will the two deal-makers be able to turn their transaction into true love? Whether he's stealing romantic highlights from other movies, sugar-coating this streetwise scenario, or turning the businessman's affairs into mere multi-million dollar afterthoughts, director Garry Marshall manages to keep a good grip on his stars (and supporting players), and the picture is fun if extremely lightweight. **1/2 from ****"
"kccardinal","10","1","3","19 December 2008"," One of the best casting jobs ever
","If there was ever a movie that deserved an Academy Award for casting, this is it. Every role is impeccably filled, from Richard Gere and Julia Robers in the leads, all the way to Abdul Salaam El Razzac as the Happy Man (""Welcome to Hollywood, what's your dream?""). Yes, the story is catchy and the screenplay is wonderful, but what makes this movie so compelling is the way absolutely every role contributes to the overall tapestry, a tribute to Garry Marshall's attention to detail. Laura San Giacomo, Jason Alexander and Hector Elizondo are at their best in supporting roles, and even the bit parts - Elinor Donohue as Bridget the saleswoman, James Patrick Steward as the bellboy, R. Darrell Hunter as Daryl the limo driver, and so many others (the patronizing salesman, the snobs at the polo match, everyone) - are perfectly cast. It is this, I think, more than any other characteristic, than has prevented a Pretty Woman sequel - and Hollywood has been clamoring for one for nearly 20 years. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate the ensemble synergy here. Besides, who needs a sequel when the original just gets better every time you watch?"
"mcfly-31","5","1","3","11 October 2008"," Pretty Average....
","I remember this hitting home video about six months after its whirlwind run in theaters. $100 million bucks, the return of Gere, the juggernaut of Roberts. And not even halfway into the film I had a surprising reaction....people fell in love with this? Such a slight, unaffecting little story involving a ""hooker with a heart of gold!"" (as she was dubbed in the trailers) and a near-comatose businessman who seemed like he was on quaaludes. It's a pretty safe bet that the financial returns of this film were driven by young girls yearning for that White Knight and couples choosing a movie as a first date. Guys were probably bored crapless, and women swooned at Gere's money-spraying nice guy.<br/><br/>But even with that a major component, the film's vignettes are not that spectacular. Polo match, opera night, fancy restaurant dinner. Not exactly jets to Paris and moved into a mansion (a majority of the film takes place in a hotel room!). I guess the gals had reason to coo over Roberts' wardrobe fiesta, with the various dress-up sessions and flashy gowns she parades around in. And for the guys? Well, there is that polo match.<br/><br/>Not to say the film is totally worthless. Roberts obviously conveys a charm that appealed to both sexes, she wouldn't have become a superstar without it. Gere is a decent enough guy, so subdued that he doesn't pose any sort of threat. And the age difference (19 years!!) shockingly has no hampering effect on their chemistry together. Others supporting them such as Elizondo and Larry Miller's infamous suck-up salesman provide a few grins.<br/><br/>But the ""comedy"" side of the script is so light and harmless (""I nearly peed my pants""; mishandling of shellfish) you're nearly lulled into oblivion by the excessive breezniness of the story. Add on some cutesy ""Bwahahaa!"" bursts of laughter from Roberts childlike character, and a forced bad-guy climax involving Alexander's lecherous lawyer, and the cookie-cutter should be nice and broken in."

"vovazhd","5","1","3","12 October 2007"," Decent comedy-romance that lacks anything special
","Pretty Woman is a comedy-romance that uses a basic plot and tries to make it interesting. It tells the story of Vivian Ward, a hooker that gets more than she bargained for when she persuades a rich business man to take her in for the night. The man, Edward Lewis, enjoys her company and offers her payment for the whole week if she stays. Then the typical romantic relationship slowly develops, with a predictable outcome. The plot tries nothing new and is too simple to garner much interest. The balance between business and love could have been good but is underplayed.<br/><br/>The acting delivers mixed results. Generally, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts do fine as the main couple. Unfortunately, a few scenes are genuinely unconvincing. The side actors are not bad, but put up forgettable performances. The music fits well, and the ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" sticks out perfectly. The camera work and effects are average for the genre.<br/><br/>The movie was not bad, but also not one that I would readily watch again. It was too shallow and didn't have anything to bring me back. It has no depth or hidden messages, just the straight story. Pass it up unless your a romance fan."

I never realized how much good music adds to a film as it did to this classic Roberts film. The hotel manager (mr Thompson) played his part to the hilt. In the scene where he questions Vivian and she says she is the niece of Edward, Vivian's eyes do all the acting getting small and beady eyed. The great ones have it (Bullock, Roberts) the ability to do such great acting with simply changing a facial feature. I have watched this movie twenty times and will watch it another twenty times.

"PWNYCNY","10","1","3","8 August 2005"," Can a prostitute fall in love?
","This movie is not about prostitution. Rather it's about a prostitute who actually grows as a person. That's plausible. It can happen. In this movie it does happen. And that is the rub. The movie is on thin ice here because the audience has to accept the premise that a prostitute can actually learn to care about her john, which is asking a lot from the audience. If the audience does not buy into the character Vivian, then the whole movie becomes unwatchable. However, Julia Roberts does such a great job as Vivian that the movie works. She was the right choice for the role; she makes the character believable. Another actress may have played the role differently with different, less satisfying results.<br/><br/>Can a prostitute fall in love? In this movie it happens. What's the problem with that? Street hookers are people too and in this movie the street hooker changes. She wants and demands money; acts out; angles for that extra buck, but eases up when she realizes that the john who is willing to pay top dollar is also a good guy who is willing to treat her like a person, not an object. This scenario is entirely plausible. Total strangers meet under the most improbable circumstances and fall in love. This formula is classic Hollywood and in this movie the actors make it work. The man treats the woman decently and she responds. That makes for a good story. The audience wants the relationship to work. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful, upbeat movie, about two people who actually learn to care about each other. The man is a rich, cynical business man; the woman is a prostitute. What starts out as a business proposition evolves into something special, as the two characters evolve and reveal aspects of themselves that are endearing and engaging. At the start of the movie, both characters have contempt for the opposite sex. The man is in the middle of getting a divorce; for the woman, men are mere customers, nothing more. But when they meet, the chemistry is instantaneous. These two people transcend their personal biases to let down their defenses and learn to sincerely care for each other, which changes their behavior and enhances their self-esteem, thereby making them better people. For this reason this movie is worth watching.<br/><br/>Recently I had the opportunity to watch this movie again on a cable network. What a great movie! Talk about opportunity knocking! Ms. Julia Roberts was something like the fourth or fifth actress to be considered for the title role, and she is great in that role. The role was meant for her. She is the center of the movie. Ms. Roberts' performance is magnificent. She is THE star. Richard Gere is good, but Julia Roberts is the one who makes this movie great. Three cheers for Julia Roberts and three cheers for this classic movie."

I was here yesterday. You refused to wait on me? Big mistake! Huge! <br/><br/>Vivan and Edward then go out on a string of business occasions were Vivan was first extremely uncomfortable, and then got ust to the whole idea, and somehow forged friendships that weren't exactly supposed to be forged. <br/><br/>Edward's overall attitude changes throughout the movie. He decides to eventually ease on work, and to focus on his developing relationship with Vivan. <br/><br/>Now Edwards lawyer Philip, is growing enormously angry with Edward after Edward tells him that Vivan is a hooker.

","I have seen this movie many times and enjoyed it thoroughly. Julia Roberts gives a compelling performance as a hooker and Richard Gere as always is superb.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about this movie was that here were two people that were not proud of what they had become but because of their need to be loved for the persons they really were deep inside, helped each other find themselves.<br/><br/>I looked deeper into this movie and saw that it was not just a comedy but a story that people can change for the better when treated with tenderness, love and understanding something these two characters had not been shown for a very long time, mostly from their own bad choices, but not totally. How this movie goes about showing that, using the comedy touch is what moved me so much about this film.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in this movie is when Edward (Gere) takes Vivian (Roberts) to an elegant restaurant for a business dinner. I think this scene is the funniest as well as the most touching scene in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie shows that you shouldn't take people at face value and to look deeper into their character to find the real person.<br/><br/>Sure this movie is a fairytale but it has deeper meaning as well, I rate this movie 9 out of 10. I have also seen Runaway Bride, which I think was actually a better romantic comedy because the characters were more believable and shows what I meant about not taking people at face value. I admit I prefer a deeper love story rather than a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>If you are like me and like a deep love story and like Richard Gere than you must watch Sommersby, one of the best and most moving love stories I have ever seen and one of Richard Gere's best performances ever, if not his best."

","This is a beautiful film, and definitely worth a watch for all of the romantics out there...<br/><br/>It's important to remember that Vivian and Edward are individuals, and not dismiss the film as unrealistic merely because, ""No, that would never happen between a prostitute and a rich guy"". Both of them aren't the typical stereotypes. They are individuals, and what began as fondness grew to something a little deeper. Edward is swept away by Vivian, who leads him away from a life that had revolved around work for years (with the unheard of day-off, walking around with bare feet), and Vivian is swept away by her ""Prince"" (with the money to shopshopshop, the trip to the opera). The story is beautiful yet plausible because they are who they are, despite their faults, and they can see through each other's occupations to the person underneath.<br/><br/>Okay, in the real world this won't happen to everybody, and whether it will last or not is another story...

","Watched this movie again, for maybe the tenth time since it was first released in 1990, and it is still as fresh as ever. An angry business man who uses his money to destroy businesses, and the in the process hurt people, meets a street hooker, a real slut, and they fall in love. Alone, both are struggling to survive; together they form a bond that nothing can break. On the surface the story seems farfetched, even contrived. A rich guy hooking up with a slutty whore - no way. However, this why this movie is so great. The story is not only believable, but appealing. Despite the huge difference in their social statuses - Edward is loaded with money and spends it, while Vivian is struggling just to pay the rent - both characters have one thing in common - intelligence. In each one's respective circles, they are surrounded by people who are not only vile but stupid. The movie captures how Edward and Vivian immediately connect. It is the key scene in the movie and shapes the entire story. Botch that scene and the whole story collapses. The cast brings this story to life. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts deliver the best performances of their careers. Gere is somber and tense and Roberts is sassy yet a little menacing. Their chemistry is impossible to miss. They become the characters they are playing. The movie depicts the story in a straightforward manner. The movie shows how Edward and Vivian evolve, in the process bringing out aspects of themselves that were lying suppressed. Alone, they were fighting the world; together, the world is theirs. Tremendous story about the power of love."
"Nobody-27","10","1","4","22 June 2017"," One of the best romantic comedies ever made
","I remember watching this film when it first came out. Even as someone who at the time did not care for romantic comedies, I actually liked it. I mean, it was not another Eisenstein or Kubrick, but for what it was, it worked for me. That was some quarter of a century ago.<br/><br/>Then, recently I started watching all those romantic comedies that I avoided over the years, and this one came up. Why not - let's see how I feel about it now.<br/><br/>And I must admit, I was stunned, in the most positive way! Again, this is not Citizen Kane or City Lights. It is a fair tale set in the modern times, but what I loved about it, now that I have a few more years of experience under my belt, was that it was crafted with incredible attention to detail. <br/><br/>Everything, and I mean EVERY little thing was done impeccably: the smooth setup at the beginning, gentle and interesting enough that we are never bothered by how unrealistic it is. The dialogues which are never forced. Scenery, which obviously being set in Beverly Hills could not be better. And finally, the ending which works so well.<br/><br/>I generally don't believe in films created by a committee. Pretty Woman went through so many re-writes and test screenings that one cannot recognize the original idea in the final result. The original was supposed to be a gritty story about a hooker, and while more realistic, it could never achieve what the fairy tale story about a nice hooker with a big heart could achieve - that great feeling that there is still love in the world that maybe, just maybe, things could turn out really well for anyone. Yes, call me delusional or romantic, but all that really works in this film.<br/><br/>They say that there was a lot of improvisation in the scenes, and they were shot many different ways. I have also seen other films by Gary Marshall and was not impressed at all. This is the only one I liked. I am tempted to believe that the director was helped by the editor or someone like that to polish out what must have started as diamond in the rough.<br/><br/>Again, if you have not seen this film yet (highly unlikely), don't expect some ""haute cinema""; but do expect some great fun, and a decent romance mixed together. One must admire the fact that such a fairy tale was made in modern times and that it manages to keep one believing in it. Never was I reminded that I was just watching a film - that's how well put together it is."

On a trip across Hollywood Boulevard he meets up with prostitute Vivian Ward. Thus begins their $3000 week long encounter that will turn into romance. The Rodeo Drive shopping trips are priceless. After a day of trying to buy clothing and being turned away Vivian goes to Hector the concierge of The Beverly Wilshire Hotel where Edward and Vivian are staying at. He helps her buy a cocktail dress and gives her a quick lesson in table manners. After Vivian explains to Edward about how humiliated she was on her shopping trip he takes her on a shopping spree that anyone would be envious of. They go to Polo Match and Edward tells his business partner Phillip Stuckey played by Jason Alexander, that Vivian is a prostitute. She is furious when they get back to the hotel and they have a fight which Vivian leaves but is persuaded by Edward to stay out the week. This begins there transformation into a real romance. Edward realizes he hurt Vivian and does not like it. They go on a date to the opera and Vivian is in awe by the performance. He offers to put her up in New York, but she refuses. Her friend and prostitute Kit De Luca, played by Laura San Giacomo, visits and realizes that Vivian is falling for Edward. After seeing where his life is and what he has missed Edward changes his plans regarding his business, which causes problems with his business partner, Philip Stuckey. By the end of the film, Vivian returns home and Edward is ready to go back to New York. He changes his plans and following Vivian's dream as a child, he goes to Vivian's home and rescues her like a knight in shining armor. They movie ends as they kiss.<br/><br/>The theme that is relevant throughout ""Pretty Woman"" is that love can overcome any obstacle. This is true when the characters are placed in situations where their social status is so different but they overcome this. They also overcome their person feelings towards relationships and give it a chance and succeed. The motifs and clear through the film. A problem with the relationship presents itself and they overcome this. Another film to watch that teams together Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, and Hector Elizondo is ""Runaway Bride"". This is another romantic comedy where the theme is the same as ""Pretty Woman"". This film will give just as many laughs also.<br/><br/>""Pretty Woman"" is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and cry. They acting is wonderful and Julia Roberts won Best Actress at the 48th Golden Globe awards for her performance. Richard Gere and Hector Elizondo were also nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for the Golden Globes. Julia Roberts was nominated for Best Actress for the Academy Awards also. J.L.

Pretty Woman a funny romantic great film which should not be taken seriously. It's an amazing tale of a prostitute who is discovered one night by a rich millionaire businessman he takes her to his Penthouse he pays her $3000 dollars for the week and expect it to be the end...but on the cover and the plot it says fairytale so you know it is going to be a happy ending and of course it is it's a 10/10 film which is know more than a bitter-sweet comedy of which can be taken with a pinch of salt it's one of the best films of 1990 and is still loved WELL DONE JULIA YOU WERE THE STAR OF THE FILM"

Julia lights up the screen with her smile and I can see her being the type of person who could make a man change his mind about work. Her wardrobe was great, she looks good in a sack, and I loved the clothes they gave her in this movie. Richard is the perfect compliment to her beauty and spirit. Julia is the perfect foil for Richard's charms. The movie is a favorite of mine, I watch it at least once a month. It so good, it makes me cry with happiness."

","This movie is not realistic, not enough like Lord of the Rings, Shawshank Redemption, the Godfather, and Spiderman. Nobody gets killed; though there is a punch thrown, it's just not the same as Mortal Kombat or Saving Private Ryan. I mean, characters develop rather than just staying put. And I am offended at the send up of salespeople at upscale stores -- they have rights, too, you know! Trying to put businessmen as the leads is quite a reach -- these guys are never important in real life, as you can tell by watching all the other films.

","Firstly I heard many people keeps saying that it's the best romantic comedy film and Julia got an award for the best actress. Well, people are probably right about Julia's acting but her role seems doesn't fit her and the film is not romantic, it's a kind of relationship drama. (I didn't realise the type of Vivian's character even I never read a description of this film)<br/><br/>I've watched it for the first time after 30 years since it was released. It's a simple story about when a rich guy(Edward) meets a poor lady(Vivian) then they're started to talking and kissing each other.<br/><br/>I don't understand one big thing, how can they didn't realise that they are in love at the near end of film after alot of kissed and slept on the same bed? There is no display of strong love affection between Vivian and Edward. In real life, love is powerful and there are so many meaning if people understand what it does mean when they're interact each other before turn into a relationship. I hardly accept if he wants her for a part of his life because he should better know about her partly life. (you may know that this film was supposed to be darker but the script has been changed).<br/><br/>The story isn't interesting and it's not quite enjoyable film. There are few funny spoken lines, Julia looks so lovely but her type of character is wrong and Richard seems sensible but the connection between them doesn't work, a director/producer should pick someone else."

"n-mo","4","0","3","8 April 2020"," Light fare in a much darker context than you'd expect
","'Pretty Woman' is kind of a blend of 'Cinderella' on the one hand and 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' on the other, albeit without any sort of family dynamic or any pretense to honesty about the dark side of human nature. What's left doesn't amount to anything more than a yuppie fantasy, a time-wasting crowd pleaser memorable only for finally rocketing the career of Julia Roberts into orbit. At best, the glamorous and unrealistic portrayal of prostitution enraged feminists, whose own angry demeanor has put them off to men and whose worthless Women's Studies degrees have rendered them barely unemployable, thus putting them one step away from the streets themselves.<br/><br/>At worst, 'Pretty Woman' marks the start of the entry of softcore for women - previously confined to bodice-ripper novels read in dank closets - into the respectable mainstream. Throughout the next couple of decades it was followed up by any number of equally bland clones (notably by Richard Curtis), paralleled at the lower level by ""Trash TV"" and at the higher level by 'Outlander,' the trend culminating of course in the '50 Shades of Grey' sensation in 2011.<br/><br/>'Pretty Woman' is a hot mess, an important relic of Hollywood and pop-culture history and part of the puzzle to understanding how the entertainment industry has helped metamorphose the mother (chiefly) of the family from guardian of manners and traditional mores into defender of gay rights and champion of perpetual childhood (the ""coddled millennials"" we're always hearing about trying to ""find themselves""). Ironically, while this is the sort of tripe serious film buffs would have scuffed at upon its initial release, it's difficult now to see how it could be of interest to anyone but a serious student of cinema and pop culture. However, I would keep it as far away from my own family as possible."
"jayjaycee","5","0","1","6 January 2020"," Money rules the world
","""Pretty Woman"" is a 1990 romance directed by Garry Marshall starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies can be entertaining if they offer enough originality and are able to distance themselves from all the clichés and stereotypes that make the genre so infamously embarrassing. There's always the same pattern that's used in almost all of them and that's why it's so hard to find seriously entertaining romances. In this case, it doesn't make an exception. First of all, I personally don't think that Richard Gere is a great actor, because probably no character has bothered me less before. He might be charming for some and even handsome (even as a straight male I don't think he is), but what bothered me the most was that he barely gave his character any depth. There was no emotion and he literally had the same face over the whole run time and has not even succeeded once to convince me once. To be honest, it was surely terrible. The score would be a lot worse if it wasn't for his counterpart, the lovely Julia Roberts. The best aspect about this somewhat forgettable flick is her ingenious portrayal of Vivian Ward and her contagious happiness. It's not only that, she had so many dimensions to her character and it developed almost perfectly in the end. She almost makes it up for what her on screen partner failed to convey. Next to this, the screenplay mostly lacks both the perfect pace and the ability to convince me that the leading actors are in love. It's full of clichés and kitsch and doesn't offer any interesting turns. It consequently stays on the same, tiring level and even a supporting role of the great Ralph Bellamy can't compensate this mess. Their on screen romance is extremely unconvincing and I actually didn't believe him that she is more than a hooker to her. With the soundtrack it's a two-edged sword, at times it fits perfectly with the tone and then it's completely misused and hard to watch. The film combines excellence and terribleness and the latter prevails. In the end, it did nothing that shocked me, it was predictable from the beginning and it's sad to see that it didn't even try to give trouble to create something that no one would expect. But this would probably destroy the beloved happy end, doesn't it? All in all, this flick is a mess that obviously suffers from the curse of its genre and doesn't entertain a bit, except for a great Julia Roberts who probably played the role of her life. Aside from this, there's nothing original in it that I would consider worth a rewatch. Not for all the roses in the world. And what's even the moral of the story? People only treat you with respect when you're rich and have money? I don't think that's the correct message to convey the audience, especially young women..."
"moivieFan","7","0","1","16 December 2019"," A good movie for a rainy day
","Even though I am old enough to have watched pretty woman when it came out in theaters the first time I watched it was on VHS. That must have been about 1990.
My favorite scenes in the movie are the ones with the Lotus Esprit. I also enjoyed the sound track.<br/><br/>In my opinion the story is not the most original and its not surprising what happens at the end. I do think its a fun ride getting to the end even though you know what is going to happen."
"bowmanblue","7","0","1","7 November 2019"," Still holds up, despite its lack of originality
","Being a guy, I'm pretty sure that this movie isn't really meant for me. No matter how the film-makers dress it up, it's your basic 'rom com.' However, just because nothing about it is original, doesn't mean that it's not at least 'watchable' (and 'watchable' is about the highest praise I can ever give a romantic comedy, based on the fact that most of my DVD collection involves car chases and alien armies being thwarted by superheros in an epic New York battle).<br/><br/>Yes, I hate to admit it, but 'Pretty Woman' is actually very funny. No, it's definitely not original. It follows the tired old genre trope of: boy meets girl, boy loses girl and boy gets girl back again. But, if the characters are interesting and we care about them, plus they make us laugh along the way, who cares?<br/><br/>In case you're the one person who doesn't actually know the plot of this film, Richard Gere plays a high-powered businessman in Los Angeles who befriends a down-on-her-luck 'working girl' (Julia Roberts). At first he pays her for her company during business events. Soon there's a flicker between them that something more may happen.<br/><br/>So, you'd probably have to have never watched a romantic comedy film before not to be able to know what happens next. But it's not a film that's supposed to 'subvert your expectations' or with a 'twist' at the end. Everything flows from A to B nicely and along the way there are many memorable funny moments that you may since have seen lampooned in various popular culture outlets.<br/><br/>I know women tend to like this film more, but I have to say that - if you're like me, i.e. a guy who isn't really into the genre - and you find yourself having to watch only ONE romantic comedy, this could be the one for you. It certainly goes quickly and the two leads are just so charming that you can't help but root for them. Also, special mention to Hector Elizondo who adds just that extra little bit of heart and charm to an already heart-filled and charming film."

","Seriously, people are gonna tell you it never happens in real life but I think the script has more meaning to it. It portrays that every prostitute don't dream to be a prostitute but life and circumstances might force them to do so. Julia Roberts does an amazing job in bringing Vivian's character to life, both as a prostitute and a ""conservative"" pretty woman. It's like in Titanic where Leonardo goes to Dinner with the highballers but does so smoothly that no one notices he doesn't belong there. Richard Gere was great in his role, but being a billionaire, what are the chances that he would take home a prostitute from the street and listens to her advice on multi-billion business deals? Quite unlikely, but his acting, the soft tone, zero emotional reactions, harsh while being romantic at times made it so much real.

Julia Roberts was perfect, she's independent, happy, and portrays a positive role for women, because it's not that she was rescued by a millionaire and transformed from being a prostitute, but her dedication to change to the betterment for herself. She wanted to do well in life, and she saw this opportunity to improve. I give this movie a 10/10 as not many movies have me watching them so often, and making me genuinely feel a part of them.

","Pretty Women is an absolute American film classic. There are some Americans out there that haven't seen it but I know they must have at the very least heard of it. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere star as the films romantic leads. Julia is a prostitute in Hollywood who gets in this very rich man's car one night to give him directions in exchange for money. This man is of course Richard Gere. They go to his fancy hotel and talk and hang out and eventually get to sex before the night is over. I enjoyed the dialogue in the film very much, Roberts and Gere have some really good writing in the scenes they share together. And Roberts is just perfect in the role, I don't think anyone else could've played her character nearly as well as she did. And the same thing goes for Richard Gere, very professional actor, very calm demeanor, and I think that worked for his character in this movie. Another actor that I loved in the movie was hector elizondo, I don't particularly know why but I just loved seeing him interact with Roberts and kind of be her guiding hand with some things she had to learn. It was sweet and charming. The romantic chemistry is very natural and it flows nicely throughout between the two.

","For Edward Lewis business is everything; he makes a fortune buying struggling businesses and then selling their component parts for far more than he paid, Vivian Ward is a prostitute who plies her trade on Hollywood Boulevard neither of them expected their lives to change when he stopped to ask the way to his hotel in Beverly Hills. He isn't looking for company but she offers to show him the way there for $20; they get chatting and he asks her to spend the night. That would have been the end of their relationship but Edward's lawyer tells him he should bring a date to a dinner meeting with a businessman whose company Edward is trying to buy. He hires Vivian for the week; to make her look the part he tells her to get the right clothes and after some problems with snobbish sales assistants the two of them spend some serious money at another store. Over the course of the week they inevitably grow feelings for each other but that isn't all; Vivian seems to be softening Edward's business attitudes too.<br/><br/>This is very much a wish fulfilment story; Vivian is a latter day Cinderella and Edward is her Prince Charming the story isn't never likely but that doesn't stop it being a lot of fun. Early on it looks as if the story might be dark as Vivian walks past a location where the police are dealing with a dead prostitute but after that things are much lighter; even characters who try to be threatening aren't that menacing; the only real exception to that is Edward's lawyer who, upon learning of Vivian's profession, thinks he can have her too. Richard Gere does an impressive job as Edward and Julia Roberts is delightful as Vivian even if she is far more believable in the fine attire Edward bought her than the street clothes she is wearing when they meet. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Most of the characters are likable and those that aren't get what is coming to them and the ending is pretty much what most viewers would expect cliché perhaps but still enjoyable.

","Let's face it, the subject matter in ""Pretty Woman"" is iffy, and it makes for an unlikely fairy tale (although, between you and me, Disney could use more movies with prostitutes in its catalog). And the movie's charms might not work at all depending on how you approach this.<br/><br/>But I don't think Julia Roberts has ever been more likable than she is here, and that quality runs throughout the cast (except for Jason Alexander, going for maximum douchebag). It's fascinating reading about some of the edits made during production as this could've been a much darker movie. But it came out more than alright.<br/><br/>All of the pieces fall into place nicely here, and with Roberts and Gere, it's no wonder this was such a big hit. Is it reality? Of course not, it's a Garry Marshall romantic comedy. But it is exceedingly enjoyable.<br/><br/>I love this movie.<br/><br/>8/10"
"nzpedals","8","0","1","1 February 2016"," Here is my rather odd observation?
","Richard Gere's character is rich, powerful, successful. So he is used to ordering people around, his lawyer, everybody. He buys companies, strips them for the assets, sells ruthlessly.<br/><br/>There is a background story which is only hinted at as he meets a chick, and... How does someone like that form a meaningful relationship? I guess it happens all the time with rich and successful people, the partner (male or female) has to accept, and cope with all that the other one is. The main person has somehow, to maybe come down a peg or three and adjust to the wants and needs and attitudes and ambitions of the other person.<br/><br/>We do see a bit of this conundrum in Pretty Woman, but it is a thought that should, or could, be developed a lot more.<br/><br/>The special parts of PW is the obvious enjoyment that Gere and Roberts show each other. They must have really enjoyed the whole process. I did too. And I loved the few scenes with Laura San Giacomo... "" Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch."""
"neyenna","7","0","1","14 December 2015"," Pretty Movie, would see again
","This romantic comedy classic is definitely worth watching. It feels very 80's at times and it's just the perfect movie for a nice, quiet evening. Also, Richard Gere is the perfect gentleman and I couldn't imagine anyone playing the part better.<br/><br/>With Julia Roberts, however, I don't really buy it. I mean she looks beautiful in the gowns and evening dresses and when she's all proper - but I don't believe it when she tries to be a hooker. Besides, the screenwriters don't really give her a chance to be the hooker, anyway. The character change goes down a little to quickly for my taste. We only see her in her street dress for a couple of minutes and then, bam, overnight she knows how to be proper. During the first dinner with James Morse she acts a little out of place but that's all. After all, she's had all of thirty seconds of ""fork training"".<br/><br/>Personally, I think the bum-to-lady change was done better in ""My Fair Lady"" (although I liked that movie overall a little less). There we could really see Eliza becoming a lady not only from the outside but also in terms of her character. In ""Pretty Woman"", Vivian just knows all too suddenly how to behave and how to express her emotions in a more elegant way.<br/><br/>Another inconceivable element of the movie for me was why they all like her in the first place. To Edward at the beginning she's only a pretty face. Is that really enough? Same with the manager of the hotel, Barney Thompson. It seems he genuinely likes her, instead of just wanting to suck up to Edward by pretending to like her.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that she's not that convincing in the first part of the movie. It's not like she's portrayed to have this irresistible personality, or at least I don't see it. She is convincing, however, with the whole ""no one's ever made me feel this cheap before"" struggle. I can't know for sure but it seemed honest enough.<br/><br/>All in all, however, I really liked ""Pretty Woman"". The chemistry between the actors is incredibly genuine (as evidenced by the clasping-the-necklace-box-shut scene (which apparently was improvised)) and the music is pretty iconic. To me the kissing scenes were also a lot less clichéd than I expected. Especially the piano scene. Oh my God, Richard Gere in the piano scene.<br/><br/>In conclusion, would see again and totally recommend it."
"sflanders-03656","6","0","1","4 December 2015"," Romantic Comedy or Romantic Drama?
","Everybody loves a good romantic comedy with lots of laughs and a happy ending. Some favorites over the years are When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, and 10 Things I Hate About You. So the question is does Pretty Woman get to join these other wonderful romantic comedies? Now although this movie does have some funny moments, it has a more serious and dramatic feeling to it most of the time. So, no this movie does not quite fulfill the requirements for a romantic comedy; although, this movie is a genuine entertainment and fulfills the ""romantic drama"" genre very well. This movie makes you think about your values and how you feel about a lot of issues they involve within the lives of the main characters, and it makes you experience many different feelings. Uniquely, it does have some comedic moments in it along with the other dramatic moments I previously mentioned. It wants the audience to be completely drawn in by the mystery and drama yet it has to ease the tension some times by making them laugh.<br/><br/>In this movie Julia Roberts plays a hooker named Vivian Ward; not only is Julia Roberts one of the best romantic comedy actress' she plays this role outstandingly. She then meets incredibly hunky and most wanted bachelor Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere. He is driving through Hollywood Boulevard when he finds himself completely lost trying to get back to his hotel in Beverly Hills. So he sees the lovely Vivian standing on the corner and asks for directions. Being a hooker she offers him directions, but at a cost of $20, classic move. He lets her in his very expensive car and away they go off to Beverly Hills. Not only is Edward incredibly handsome he is very wealthy as well, so when they get to the hotel Vivian is star struck and the attraction is tied; the rest is history.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by the fact that it's not a very funny comedy since I was excited to slump down on my couch with a bucket of popcorn ready to laugh for the next two hours. In the aspects of a romantic drama though the movie was outstanding and I did not regret watching it. So, if you're ready to sit down and watch a genuinely funny film I would not suggest Pretty Woman, although if you wish to see a film full of romance and intimacy this is perfect for you and you will not be disappointed. I suggest to all audiences out there, if you watch a movie titled as a ""comedy"" don't be discouraged because you aren't laughing so hard your stomach hurts, but instead try to be optimistic because you could come across your new favorite movie."

","Pretty Woman is the Cinderella like tale of Vivian (Julia Roberts), a street wise and somewhat innocent prostitute, and Edward Louis (Richard Gere), a tough talking, and sincerely loving billionaire! Edward hires Vivian for a week so he doesn't have to deal with his two previously failed relationships (one with a girlfriend, and one with his ex-wife) for the week. While Edward puts in long working days with the client after another, Vivian lives the high life at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, goes shopping on Rodeo Drive (after being turned away by the snubbed shopkeepers), goes to a match of Polo, and goes to the Opera in San Francisco (they take his jet). In the midst of all this, Vivian and Edward fall in love, it's as simple as that. Julia Roberts, in the role that made her a star, gives a simply wonderful, witty, hilarious, and heart touching performance. Richard Gere gives a great performance as well, but he obviously falls back in the light that Julia shines on this film, she is without a doubt a true star! If you love Julia Roberts (and who wouldn't, she's a great actress!) this is the film to see! After all, it made her a star, and is a great example of her early work. Roberts and Gere are such a great team, they were later teamed again in Runaway Bride. Get it, see it, you'll love it!"

","Welcome to Hollywood! What's your dream? Everyone has a dream. Without doubt Pretty Woman is a product of the Hollywood dream factory where you can imagine yourself being Cinderella, or anyone else in the world for that matter, for two hours plus pop corn. Having said that, unless you take Hollywood fantasies soooo seriously you're ready to throw something at the screen, Pretty Woman is one of the sweetest, most enchanting movies imaginable, a drama about sex (very little shown) and over-the-top consumption that, after 25 years, has taken on iconic, if not classic status and is now the highest grossing romantic comedy of all time.<br/><br/>The terrific performances of Julia Roberts (nominated for an Oscar), Richard Gere, and Jason Alexander is the main factor that makes the film so special, but it also contains memorable lines, a relationship with believable chemistry, and a satiric portrait of the excesses of consumer spending and elitism. It is after all, a comedy and the film does not attempt to explore the dark corners of Hollywood, though there is talk that originally the ending was much different. While there is talk of a crack addict being pulled out of the dumpster and drug dealers hounding Vivian (Roberts), we never really find out what in Vivian's background led her to the choice she made or really learn what turned Edward (Richard Gere) into a cold and calculating money grubber.<br/><br/>The characters that we do see, however, are authentic. They are fragile individuals who have the ability to see possibilities beyond their self-defeating cynicism. Those who think that Pretty Woman glamorizes a sordid profession are quiet when it comes to the high-priced call girls in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Verdi's La Traviata (an opera the film pays homage to), or to Don Giovanni which depicts a compulsive seducer who cannot see past his own sense of entitlement. It is no revelation to say that Pretty Woman is unrealistic and lacks character depth but, in its own way, it is a celebration of the resiliency of the human spirit and its capacity for transformation. If you close your eyes and think hard enough, maybe even your dream can come true."

What results is some fun entertainment in seeing how Edward turns Vivian from a street-smart hooker to a beautiful and classy lady. It is also entertaining to see how Edward's hectic business life unravels as the story unfolds and how it results in an unusual bonding between him and Vivian.<br/><br/>The plot goes at a steady pace, but does tend to drag toward some parts in the middle of the movie. The acting was mostly spot-on, with Julia Roberts stealing the show in my opinion. But, also great was Hector Elizondo hotel manager Barney Thompson, who showed indifference but care into his character, and inserted a little bit of wisdom in the movie where appropriate. Gere was OK in his role, though, I thought he was a bit too emotionless at times.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad romantic comedy, which does not overdo on the sexual references and, instead, concentrate on the special relationship between Vivian and Edward and the rags-to-riches subplot.

","Some people say this movie 'glorifies' prostitution but I think it offers the perspective that call girls are still real people with good and bad qualities. I wouldn't say I respect the career choice, but I can still adore Vivian with her sense of humor, naivety, and confidence vs insecurity. She is human and believable as a character, which gives us hope because she gets to live out a fairytale.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a bit cheesy, but don't we all like the idea of being rescued by someone who falls for us in our 'worst' light? How could anyone not love this movie, and Vivian in her own right? She's adorably innocent despite her profession, vulnerable yet bolshy and her juxtaposition is fascinating. I enjoy watching the character change as she starts to see her self-worth, that's not just related to money but learning to love herself."

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","1","12 September 2013"," Pretty woman, walking on the streets, pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
","This is from Roy Orbinson 1964's hit song that reached its cinematic posterity 26 years later, with Garry Marshall's film of the same name. Oddly enough, when taken in the context of the film, the lyrics take a totally different significance since the titular 'pretty woman' doesn't quite walk on the streets for pleasure.<br/><br/>Of course, the song is used for the film's trademark sequence when Vivian tries new clothes from prestigious French sounding shops, fulfilling every little girl's fantasy. But there's something genuinely appealing in Julia Robert's performance, a sort of child-like eagerness to embrace a one-week dream and do whatever she wants because she got woman's most cherished accessory, not a handbag, not a lipstick or a mirror, but a credit card. Don't take that statement as patronizing and misogynistic please, ""Sex and the City"" convey the same message, and bluntly assumes it. What differentiates Vivian from the other feminist icons though relies on the roots of her constant enthusiasm, forever incarnated by Robert's unique smile  and irresistible giggles.<br/><br/>Indeed, no matter how much fun she has while seizing her luxurious days, we know that she's happy, more than anything, because she's in love. And the man might be rich, handsome and powerful, like a modernization of the 'Charming Prince' figure, there's something that oddly rings true in that peculiar love story. And this is a credit to two fine performances from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and a clever screenplay that doesn't take its premise for granted, starting from the obligatory meeting, which is the hit-or-miss of romantic comedies. Gere is Edward Lewis, he can't drive a friend's car and find his way to the hotel, he meets a prostitute named Vivian, she's not only attractive, but she's smart. She knows about car and end up driving him to the hotel. So, when he invites for just one night, that will turns into one week, plot-wise, the machine is working.<br/><br/>""I want the fairy tale"" she admits later, with an innocence that sweeps off all the dirt that has tarnished her life since she started walking on the streets. Never in the film, had she felt more sincere and more naively appealing. All little girls want the fairy tale, and that quote, if one thing, highlights the fact there still is that 'little girl' sparkle in Vivian's eyes, and her profession is only a logical consequence to unfortunate circumstances. But the film doesn't fall in the patronizing trap either, Vivian needs Edwards, but so does he. There's a clever parallel established by these two people's jobs, Edward buys out companies facing economic difficulties, to sell parts of them and make more profits. As she says, both screw people for money, and Edward is no more honorable than Vivian.<br/><br/>Both hearts reflect the other's truth, that's the mark of true love and that's exactly what happens to Edward and Vivian. There's a nice subplot involving one company Edward doesn't want to buy because he likes its chairman, who's a sort of fatherly figure, wonderfully played by Ralph Bellamy, and it's only after his experience with Vivian that he realizes he doesn't enjoy his job as she did and might have chosen the wrong path for some obscure Oedipal reasons. Vivian, didn't embrace her career with more passion either, but maybe she kept on hoping of a real love, one that would be incarnated by the only thing she couldn't give her customers: a kiss. And the pay-off comes when she tenderly kisses a sleeping Edward in the mouth, at that point, we know she loves him.<br/><br/>""Pretty Woman"" doesn't overplay the whole Pygmalion-theme, that one is handled by Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager who, from despising Vivian, grows fond on her and teaches her how to properly behave. But the film doesn't use their archetypes for the sake of cheap laughs, it doesn't need to, Roberts is hilarious because she stays natural in a world she doesn't belong to, and never condescending either, Edward is inspired by her spontaneity, something that cruelly lacks in his work of sophistication and cynical materialism, incarnated by his friend and lawyer, played by Joe Constanza. Constanza, as the only true antagonist of the film, is responsible of one of the film's saddest parts, after Gere comforted him that Vivian wasn't a spy. After being approached like a cheap prostitute, you could feel she was truly hurt by Edward's betrayal.<br/><br/>And this is what the film is about, two persons who don't want to be reduced to condescending label, one in the highest, and another in the lowest extreme. Being treated like a prostitute is the ultimate insult for Vivian because it totally negates her struggle to let her personality finally bloom, as Edward knows he's not that rich prick who only thinks in green bills. It's all about becoming yourself. I don't intend to make the film sound like an existential journey; it's still a heart-warming comedy but more intelligent and subtle than any comedy made today. And I'm sure in retrospect; many critics who despised the films would feel guilty for having labeled ""Pretty Woman"" too straightforwardly as a banal and commercial romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Rom-com, chick-flick, Cinderella story, feel-good story  cinematic jargon is rich of epithets to describe Garry Marshall's ""Pretty Woman"". Yet these words are too convenient and tend to veil the true poignancy and endearing chemistry between the two leads. Yes, we have the rich workaholic businessman with a disastrous sentimental life, meeting the streetwise hooker, with a heart of gold, but when played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts whose shining smile illuminates the screen like a lamppost in Hollywood Boulevard, the film turns out to far better than some cynical minds might expect.<br/><br/>At the end, I was left wondering: aren't the so-called stereotypes the names we give to obligatory plot devices when they're wrongly handled?"
"Benjamin_Cox","8","0","1","28 May 2013"," A romantic pantomime with real chemistry at its heart - 85%
","Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - ""The Accidental Husband"", ""27 Dresses"", ""Fifty First Dates"", ""Never Been Kissed"", ""Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason"" and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in.<br/><br/>Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of ""Cinderella"", ""Pretty Woman"" is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is ""Cinderella"" and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size...<br/><br/>So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said ""Go on, girl!"" during certain scenes, although she prefers ""Dirty Dancing"". I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much."

","""Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch."" - Kit<br/><br/>I could write this review in the dark. I've seen Pretty Woman so many times, I cannot count. I take that back: I can count how many timesI saw it in the theatre.<br/><br/>Back in Summer 1990 – yes, months after this opened, I saw it for the first time, in an empty theatre, during an afternoon weekday. I didn't want to see it, but everyone including my beloved Aunt recommended it over and over. And over. And over. So, I caved.<br/><br/>Six more viewings, including the last 2 on the same day, and I have had a record for me for one single movie unbroken since 1990. Yes, I saw Pretty Woman 7 times in the movie theatres. Obviously, I loved it back then. And still do. It's always like an old friend when I revisit this, albeit, one I can quote word for word, but still.<br/><br/>Granted the movie's one singular flaw is that it's not the most original concept. For that, on my personal scientific scale of rating movies, it lost one single point bringing the overall score to 99/100. Rarely, on my list, will any movie even get above 95/100, let alone 99/100and only one got to 100/100. So, when I even state the word ""flaw,"" I mean in the absolute smallest of ways. And besides, they address this with that one funny line: ""What, you want me to name someone? You want like a name? Oh, God, the pressure of a name... I got it. Cindafuckin'rella!"" – Kit <br/><br/>Actually, come to think of it, there's dozens of funny lines, motions, scenes. I laugh as hard as I cry during each viewing. This movie is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end with its perfect balance of drama, comedy and romance.<br/><br/>Emotionally beaten down Vivian (Julia Roberts – in a role that propelled her into space) had just recently begun streetwalking when she's picked up, initially for directions, by über-rich Edward Lewis (Richard Gere in a masterful performance) on Hollywood Boulevard. When it's realized she's a hooker with a heart and he's a hopeless romantic, they slowly begin a relationship, despite her being requested, um paid, to be at his ""beck and call"" for the remainder of his business trip in L.A.<br/><br/>Of course, things are going to get complicated as roles are defined, and others have been thrown into the mix, but these two actors were so incredibly believable, so real and had so many genuine reactions and improved lines/scenes, you will fall hard for their romance.<br/><br/>I've wanted to write this review of one of my all time favorite movies for quite some time. Sadly, I do not think, even with the countless (home) viewings, that I will do this movie justice. I will just say what's on my mind, and always on my mind when I see this:<br/><br/>Fantastic lines, great pacing, deep romance, believable faces, one of the best soundtracks ever, also great score, real and fun. From beginning to end, I get involved and not just because I've seen it before; it's just a journey I love to get involved in and always pretend it's my first time. So much so, that I literally smile wide (like the absolutely stunning Roberts in this) when a scene comes up I didn't allow myself to recall.<br/><br/>This has been, is and always will be one of my all-time favorite movies. It thoroughly improved on the old Cinderella story one-hundred times. And this version is absolutely timeless.<br/><br/>Side Note: As mentioned above, I've seen this movie 7 times in the theatre and the last 2 of those, on the same day. Just to explain, I had the day off of school, and was to meet my friends at the now-defunct Valley West Mall's dollar theatre. Actually, it was Tuesday's 50 cent day. So, while waiting on my friends, who did not have the day off, I decided on seeing Pretty Woman for the sixth and final time during the early afternoon. Little did I know, they, too, wanted to see it, so I went to go with them to the same theatre screen, the same day, to see Pretty Woman a seventh time.<br/><br/>Side Note II: Since I am a huge Superman fan, I wanted to break this 7x in the theatre record in 2006 with Superman Returns. Sadly, as much as I liked that movie (and wanted to more) I could only make it to 5 viewings. Here's to 2013's Man of Steel. I am going to try and break the record once more!"

","To maintain their wholesome image, Walt Disney Studios released ""Pretty Woman"" under the umbrella of their ancillary company, Touchstone Pictures. But ""Pretty Woman"", a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same.<br/><br/>The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because ""his father doesn't love him"". Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who ""provides jobs to shipbuilders"". She rescues him from depression and ""bad"" capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, ""bad"" capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in ""moral transactions"". They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships.<br/><br/>Like ""Indecent Proposal"", released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and ""just another career choice"". Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's ""The Soft Skin"", where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover.<br/><br/>To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a ""whore"". Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display.<br/><br/>4/10 - ""My Fair Lady"" meets ""Cinderella"" meets ""Pygmalion"". Worth one viewing."

","""Pretty Woman"" is a lightweight but entertaining fairy tale about Prince Charming. Everything about director Garry Marshall's upbeat romantic comedy is as contrived as it is sugar coated from subversion of any sort. Although it received an R rating, this sappy two hour plus love story shows what happens to a handsome but heartless Wall Street titan when he encounters a savvy street prostitute in Beverly Hills and how their lives change radically for the better. Despite its predictable plot, ""Pretty Woman"" wins us over with the chemistry and charisma of the principals. Richard Gere plays protagonist Edward Lewis with wisdom and suavity. He is a businessman who buys companies and then breaks them up and sells them off. Consequently, the milk of human kindness doesn't flow in his blood. Sheer coincidence brings our hero face to face with the heroine, young but gorgeous, and ""Pretty Woman"" charts their fate together.<br/><br/>Reportedly, scenarist J.T. Lawton's original script emphasized gutter realism over utter unreality. Marshall and his writers have sanded off all the rough edges. Our hero is in Los Angles when he discovers that his girlfriend is about to ditch him. He tries to drive a Lotus Esprit and nearly wrecks it. Kit and Vivian are prowling their share of the sidewalk when Edward cruises up and parks. Of course, he hasn't so much parked as jammed his car up so he cannot get it to run. He inquires for directions for Beverley Hills from her. He asks her afterward if she can drive the Lotus. They wind up at his Beverley Hills hotel and Edward buys Vivian for the night and then the week. He shells out thousands of dollars to get Vivian a proper wardrobe so she can accompany him in public and appear presentable. Chiefly, Edward wants to buy out a company that makes ships and sell it off, but the owner-founder, James Morse (Ralph Bellamy of ""The Professionals"") refuses to bow out without a fight. Edward did not have a good relationship with his own father Carson. Indeed, when Carter died, neither had spoken to each other in 14 and a half years. Initially, Edward savors the process of carving up Morse's company until he begins to see him as a human.<br/><br/>Richard Gere and Julia Roberts make Edward and Vivian very palatable, very sexy, and very sympathetic. The happily ever after ending is contrived. Interestingly, the two principals move onto to better things. Ostensibly, Jason Alexander is delivers the best performance as Edward's cutthroat attorney, Philip Stuckey, who has been with him ten years. Philip's abrasive treatment of Vivian alienates Edward and he fires Philip. Hector Elizondo has a memorable supporting role as the hotel manager who helps Vivian with her wardrobe. There isn't a single character in this romantic comedy that has any depth or subtlety. Marshall relies on wardrobe to define his characters and neither the protagonist nor the heroine is ever in jeopardy. The Beverly Hills shopping scene when our heroine returns to Rodeo Driver is amusing. The people who made this diverting epic create characters that you find yourself rooting for and liking and the villains get their comeuppance."

","Okay, so this movie is suppose to be a romantic classic and one of Julia Roberts trademark movie. So I decided to see it, this is a sappy movie and is pretty predictable most of the way through but for some reason it's kinda engaging. Maybe it's because of some good lines in the movie, as corny as it maybe sometimes though. So the premise is this, a rich guy picks up a hooker for some reason and likes her enough to the point he is willing to pay her 3 grand to stay with him for a week as an escort to events he needs or wants to attend. And one thing leads to another and so on. Now the chemistry doesn't really develop to the point you can understand why they like each other besides the superficial, materialistic or sex getting in the way. So in another words most of the comes off superficial and pretentious. The premise of a rich guy and a poor girl has been done so many times, but in this it just didn't seem all that developed. Even the parts about building a conscious isn't very believable either. But that being said it did a alright job of putting everything together in less than 2 hours. While in most Asian dramas that have a similar premise takes up 16 to 20 episodes and usually tends to drag. This movie will inspire other dramas to come that share the same or similar elements. In a way this is sort of like the 90's ""The Notebook"". Anyways overall this is a shallow and predictable flick with some sentimental stuff in it and to some degree it's entertaining.<br/><br/>6/10"

","1st watched 8/17/2010 -- 8 out of 10 (Dir-Garry Marshall): Well put together romance is one of the better ones in this genre, in my opinion. The story is about a rich man, played by Richard Gere, who's personal life is falling apart and picks up a hooker, played by Julia Roberts, on Hollywood Boulevard initially just to get directions but then ends up keeping her around for a week and of course pays for it. He's the type of person who is married to his job and does it well, and Julia's character works a job where love is out of the question with her clients(no kissing on the lips, basically). They are both hard nuts to crack in different ways but each helps the other to overcome their issues. Although the story is somewhat like a prince rescuing a princess story, it varies in that both parties are really rescuing each other. Garry Marshall, the director, does a good job of telling the story without adding too much cliché-driven jokes or side stories but instead just lets the story happen. Gere and Roberts bring their natural charms to the roles and they are a perfect fit for their characters. I usually don't like sappy endings but this one was really well written and it lifted the movie up to classic status, in my opinion. Bravo to Marshall and the gang for making this movie tasteful yet still for adults."

","I thought Michelle Pfeiffer, WInona Ryder or Molly Ringwald would make an excellent Vivian Ward.

The actresses that should play Julia Roberts role are Claire Danes, Anne Hathaway, Kirsten Dunst, Emma Roberts, Natalie Portman, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Carmen Electra or Megan Fox. I think one of these actresses would be great for Julia Roberts role because they are beautiful women than Julia Roberts.

Every character was perfectly defined and artists did full justice to their role. Julia appeared as over reacting some times but over all that was a great show by the director.

","Edward Lewis is a very rich man, but money, as everyone knows, does not buy everything, and as yet another failed relationship falls by the wayside, Edward faces up to the prospect of a hectic social week on his own. Enter a meeting with ebullient hooker Vivian Ward, who upon impressing Edward with her happy go lucky values, gets herself hired to be his escort for the week ahead, it's a week that both of them are unlikely to ever forget.<br/><br/>It almost became the in thing to stomp all over the respective work of both Richard Gere (Edward) and Julia Roberts (Vivian), adding fuel to the fire of those with an aversion to both actors is that the crowd pleasing Pretty Woman hails from that dreaded genre known as 1980s Rom-Com. Seemingly many can now not see just what made Pretty Woman so popular back in 1990. Gary Marshall's film was the fourth highest box office taker in 1990, grossing a domestic $178,406,268, and at the same time made the date movie hip again, so basically all you Pretty Woman haters can take both those facts to the bank!<br/><br/>As the opening credits emerge, Peter Cox (lead singer of pop band Go West) starts warbling about ""The King Of Wishful Thinking"", and never was a more appropriate song used to open such a genre piece before or since, and this is the key issue with Pretty Woman. Yes, the whole structure and plot devices are all fanciful splendour, I mean does anyone seriously think that hookers look and act like Julia Roberts? But really if you are entering this picture expecting anything other than a modern ""My Fair Lady"" like fairytale then the blinkers need to be well and truly taken off. It's also a point of worth to say that Pretty Woman has something to say outside of the main intention to lift hearts and make one smile, Marshall, aided by his screenwriter J.F. Lawton, tie in smartly the fact that Edward is as much a hustler as Vivian is, only difference being that Edward is incredibly wealthy and has therefore grown in public stature.<br/><br/>Both Roberts and Gere have brilliant chemistry, so it was no surprise to see they would work together again in 1999 on ""Runaway Bride"", and both actors are helped immeasurably by splendid support from Hector Elizondo as the hotel manager, Barney Thompson. The picture is laced with joyous moments that hark back to the golden days of screwy comedies laced with unlikely romances, and this was something that clearly struck a chord with cinema goers back on the film's original release. Yes it's a touch over sweet at times, and yes the ending is never really in doubt, but if you are prepared to invest some fluffy chilled out time with Pretty Woman then you can see and feel just why it was the big hit it was back at the start of the 90s. 8/10"

","Pretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition) has to be considered one of the most classical,romantic comedies made throughout the years.

This classic ""fairy tale"" movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest. This is not your typical romantic movie and I believe that is why so many people love this movie. Pretty Woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there. The 15th Anniversary Special Edition also brought some never-before-seen scenes, deleted scenes, and commentary. The deleted scenes are also a must watch, they are just simply hilarious, and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes.

","Overall this is a cute film but in many ways it's highly questionable. I remember when it was released a lot a people felt the film's flamboyant portrayal of prostitution sent a wrong kind of message. In many ways I agree with those people.<br/><br/>But putting the harsh realities of the real world aside, Pretty Woman is a fun little film. Never expecting to gross a lot of money, this was a completely unexpected hit in 1990. Keep in mind that Gere's career was going down the toilet and Roberts was still a relative unknown, despite her Oscar nominated performance in Steel Magnolias (and it was Gere who was chosen because of his looks and Roberts because of her charm and talent).<br/><br/>Gere and Roberts play extremely well off each other and they're chemistry is what makes the film a success. Roberts isn't believable as a prostitute for a minute but she's so charming you can't really hold that against her. Ditto for Laura San Giacomo, not always a likable performer but here she's a riot as Roberts's best friend. Hector Elizondo proves to be a real scene stealer, as always. Gere is really good as the lonely and somewhat cold business man, he's very low-key and he seems to realize that it's best to let Roberts chew the scenery with him supporting her (and he's a damn fine piano player to boot).<br/><br/>This is pure Hollywood fluff all the way and as such it's enjoyable. The upbeat music is fantastic (and has aged surprisingly well) and there are enough heartwarming scenes to ensure that a few hankies are in order for sentimental viewers.<br/><br/>Trivia note; I'll be damned if that romantic instrumental tune (credited to James Newton Howard) isn't a complete rip off of Bruce Springsteen's piano intro to ""Racing in the Street"" from his 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town. A useless trivia but I just had to mention it."

","I have seen this film too many times to mention and I have never tired of this charming fairytale. The plot is very simple. A young prostitute is picked up by a wealthy businessman and after spending the night with him she is offered an exorbitant sum of money to spend an entire week living in his hotel suite. She of course accepts and the rest is history.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts launched an incredible career from this film and her sweet and vulnerable portrayal of Vivian Ward makes you warm to her almost from the very beginning. Richard Gere is suitably debonair as the cynical businessman Edward Lewis who is captivated by Vivian's charms. The chemistry here is amazing and was not to be repeated in the disastrous Runaway Bride. This films ending is possibly one of the most memorable in romantic comedy history.<br/><br/>The important thing that critics of this film should bear in mind is that it is not meant to be taken too seriously. It is just a modern fairytale that girls everywhere can relate to on some level. Real prostitutes do not have Vivian's naivety or bubbly nature and of course in reality she would be expected to be much more jaded by her experiences. This film does glamorise the world of prostitution but this is not a serious enough film for this to warrant any real concern. Young girls will not watch this film and yearn to work the streets. They will see through to the real moral of the story which is that a persons life can change for the better no matter how bad things get. This surely cannot be a bad thing for them to learn."

","I had seen this film a couple of times before, I slightly questioned the morals of the story, but I'm glad I watched it all over again to get a proper opinion, directed by Garry Marshall (Beaches, Runaway Bride, The Princess Diaries, Valentine's Day). Basically in Los Angeles, Edward Lewis (Golden Globe nominated Richard Gere) is a rich businessman, with his good lucks and wealth he could have any woman he wants, but he is a workaholic. One night he gets lost looking for Beverly Hills, he ends up on Hollywood Boulevard in the red light district, he encounters a prostitute named Vivian Ward (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Julia Roberts), mistaking him for a possible client her roommate and best friend Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo) encourages her to approach him. Edward makes a deal to pay Vivian if she will show him the way, he is intrigued by her and hires her to spend the night with him in his hotel penthouse apartment, she is surprised he does not instantly want sex, he treats her to champagne and strawberries, after watching television they do eventually have sex. Next morning Edward's attorney Phillip Stuckey (Jason Alexander) informs him he will need a date for upcoming events, so he offers to hire Vivian for the week, she advises him it will cost a lot, he agrees to $3,000, also giving her money and cards to spend on suitable elegant clothing. Vivian's unsophisticated and overly sexual appearance however causes her problems, she is snubbed by clothing store saleswomen, and hotel manager Barney Thompson (Héctor Elizondo) is initially hostile toward her, but he slowly changes his opinion and helps her find clothing and teaches her dinner etiquette. Edward is amazed by Vivan's transformation, but dinner does not go well as the plan is for him to take over the shipyard business of James Morse (Ralph Bellamy), before dismantling it to sell as real estate, Morse and his grandson David Morse (Alex Hyde-White) abandon the dinner in anger. Later at the hotel Edward reveals to Vivian that he lives with the memory that he did not speak to his father before he died 14 years ago, Vivian fails to cheer him up, but she later consoles him, and they end up having sex on the grand piano in the hotel lounge. The next day, Edward wants Vivian to buy one dress, she explains her upset at being snubbed, so he takes her to a store and makes sure the staff will serve them, he leaves Vivian with money and cards, she goes on a shopping spree, she even returns to the store she was snubbed in, telling the saleswomen they made a mistake, and announcing she ""has to go shopping now"", leaving them speechless. The following day Edward takes Vivian to a polo match, he is sponsoring the event and hopes to continue the deal with Morse, Phillip suspects something about Vivian, Edward assures him she is a hooker, Phillip insults Vivian revealing that he knows she is a sex worker, and suggesting he hires her when she is done with Edward. Vivian is angry with Edward for telling Phillip what she does and plans to leave, he apologises and persuades her to see out the week, assured she will stay they go out for the evening to the opera in San Francisco, she is clearly growing closer to him and convinces him to take the following day off. Edward and Vivian spend the day entirely together talking and enjoying each other's company, during the night Vivian breaks her ""no kissing on the lips"" rule, and they make love for the first time, and she admits that she loves him just before she falls asleep. Edward insults Vivian when he suggests and she rejects him putting her up in an apartment to be off the streets, he leaves her without resolving the situation, Kit comes to the hotel to collect her money, she realises Vivian is in love with Edward, and reluctantly encourages her to pursue a relationship with him. Edward is close to closing the deal with Morse, but changes his mind at the last minute, he always dreamed of building something rather than tearing it down, he wants to help Morse, Phillip is angry they will lose money and confronts Vivian, blaming her for Edward's change, he attempts to rape her, but Edward arrives in time to stop him and throw him out. The week has ended, Edward tries to convince Vivian to stay, not because he is paying her, but because she wants to, she leaves and returns to Kit's apartment, Edward is due to return to New York, but Barney subtly persuades him to go after Vivian, in the end Edward climbs up the fire escape with a bunch of flowers, Vivian is happy to see him, it ends with them declaring love for each other and passionately kissing. Also starring Amy Yasbeck as Elizabeth Stuckey, Elinor Donahue as Bridget, Judith Baldwin as Susan and The Nutty Professor's Larry Miller as Mr. Hollister. Roberts is enchanting as the beautiful hooker with a heart, Gere is likable as the good looking work-obsessed wealthy bachelor, together they make the story plausible, it has a well-written screenplay, great performances, it makes you laugh in the right places, and it is a love story you can get into, all together it's an enjoyable romantic comedy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Richard Gere was number 76, and Julia Roberts number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Gere was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!"

Anyone who still wonders why this woman became the top box office star of the nineties needs to re-watch this film again.<br/><br/>As for the film's story, it's basically yet another variation on PYGMALION/MY FAIR LADY, but it is totally energized by Robert's fresh and incandescent presence. Richard Gere is fine but a little on the stoic side as Roberts' modern-day Henry Higgins (I couldn't help but wish he would have displayed some more of his trademark intensity), but Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo shine in memorable supporting roles. Best of all is veteran screen star Ralph Bellamy (THE AWFUL TRUTH, HIS GIRL Friday) who (at age 86) is funny and touching as Gere's business nemesis/father figure. Deftly directed by audience-pleaser Garry Marshal, PRETTY WOMAN is a must for individuals who like the romance emphasized in their romantic comedies."

","""Pretty Woman"" is an interesting fairy-tale-romance film. Although some elements seem just too unlikely, the film manages to capture the viewer and entertains greatly. Whilst the film has no real substance-not really any message- it never fails to achieve its purpose, and that is to entertain. Julia Roberts gives a decent performance as the innocent hooker who by luck transforms into an elegant woman. Perhaps the film shows that even the most sharp of thorns, a prostitute, can indeed change for the better. Unfortunately, as with most ""rom-coms"", the film is riddled with clichés, but always a certain uniqueness is present. Most elements are perfectly sound, acting and directing challenges are well met, however the film never excels in any particular way, which perhaps has led to its' success- a well-rounded simple film that almost any person can watch, and, however mildly, enjoy."

","I remember when PRETTY WOMAN first came out in the summer of 1990. I did not go see it then but remember how people made a big fuss about the movie. All these years, I had not watched the movie except for bits and pieces of it. At any rate, I took the time to rent it and actually found it to be a cute movie. In fact, it was better than I expected. Did I find the movie to be realistic at all? Absolutely not. However, it IS a fairytale and by viewing it from that perspective, I enjoyed it. The basic premise is that Julia Roberts plays a prostitute named Vivian who, despite her profession, is basically a good person. One night, Richard Gere (Edward) picks her up and decides he wants to use her for a night. He ends up using her for the week. During that time, he shows her a side to life that she has never been exposed to before such as attending the opera. The week goes by and they both find that they really like each other but they realize they need to part ways. Of course, this being a fairytale, he finds her and they go off to live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Again, if I were to judge the movie on how realistic I felt it was, I would say completely unrealistic. However, judging the movie for what it is, it showed that here were two people who, despite their both being totally different on the surface were actually quite similar. I.E. Julia Roberts's character Vivian is a hooker and Richard Gere's character Edward is a businessman who makes a living through mergers and acquisitions. My point is that that both characters basically use people to make money. Also, it showed how Vivian who was street-smart kind of softened Edward up a little and at the same time, Edward showed Vivian a life outside of prostitution. If there is one thing I want to say about PRETTY WOMAN, I want to say that I found the message to be that it is never to late to follow one's dreams.<br/><br/>As for this movie, I understand there were several script versions for it. At one point, Al Pacino was considered for the Richard Gere role. Personally, I imagine this would have been a darker movie had Al Pacino starred in it. Also, I understand there was a version where Vivian was on cocaine and her roommate Kit died of a drug over-dose. Had that version been made, the film would have been more realistic. However, as I stated above, this is basically a Cinderella story.<br/><br/>I want to mention a few things about PRETTY WOMAN. Probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie is where Vivian (Julia Roberts) walks along Rodeo Drive wearing her tall black hooker boots and her mini-skirt. Here she is completely out of place and when she goes into the fancy shops in an attempt to buy ""more appropriate"" clothing, the merchants refuse to help her. Then the next day, after a nice lady helped her, she goes to the merchants who would not help her and said ""Do you remember me? You wouldn't help me. Do you work on commission? Big Mistake!"" I liked that scene because as is so often the case, people tend to judge others only on the surface or think ""this person has no money. He's not well dressed."" When watching the DVD of PRETTY WOMAN, I also took the time to watch the movie with the narration by Garry Marshall, the director. That is very interesting as he explains how the different scenes were shot and why they turned out the way they did. It is also worth mentioning that this is the very last movie that Ralph Bellamy made as he passed away a year or so after the film was released. In conclusion, I want to say PRETTY WOMAN is worth watching some time when you just want to relax and not deal with reality."

All the while Vivian is just sitting there with her lack of any etiquette, making the audience fall in love with her even more.<br/><br/>Gere and Roberts have such chemistry and presence on screen, they just click from the get go, and look like two people having a great time at work. Gere has never looked more handsome, and I love how Edward changes his views on his business life after one week of time with Vivian. And I love how Vivian slowly lets Edward into her life, her feelings, and who she is as a person. I'm so glad Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for this role. It is what cemented her on Hollywood's A list.<br/><br/>Yes, Pretty Woman has an outrageous story, and in real life can probably happen once in a blue moon. But hey!

","I guess you could describe ""Pretty Woman"" as the role model for all romantic comedies. It's probably one of the first in the genre (I can't think of an older one right now) and is therefor alone already worth a watch.<br/><br/>Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is the prototype of the rich business man. He has plenty of money, he's good looking and has no big problems even though his girlfriend is leaving him right now. He is specialized in taking over companies in need, dividing them in separate parts and selling those parts for a big profit. Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) is some kind of business woman too. She's a prostitute working on Hollywood Boulevard, selling her body for big money, when she meets Edward who has hired her for the night. He is overwhelmed by her because she's the only one who has been able to surprise him in a long time. He offers her money to stay with him the entire week and to join him on several social events. At first she doesn't fit in, but she learns quickly and soon she grabs the chance he gives her to change her life...<br/><br/>Even though this movie is pretty predictable by today's standards, this still is a nice movie. The combination of Richard Gere with Julia Roberts really works well and both actors did a very good job by making their characters believable. The movie offers plenty of humor and that's all I ask from a comedy. That's why I reward it with a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10."

","I found Pretty Woman to be a very touching movie. It took the darker side of life(prostitution)and made it meet with the brighter side of life(business) and created a combo that rarely takes place in this world. It made a statement that no matter who you are and where you come from, your dreams can come true.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic thought out movie. The director should be thanked. Not by applauding for them but by shaking their hand.<br/><br/>Rarely do you see such a movie where the high chains and low chains of life collide. The movie showed how life on the streets was horrible and how being a business person can relay so much stress into your life. But most of all it fore played how well a dreamer on the streets succeed in playing the most important role in a business man's life.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts acted the part of Vivian the hooker to the greatest extreme. She played the part of a hooker who wanted more out of life than just a few bucks from the guys she hooked up with. Julia made the role a success therefore, leading the movie to a non stop success.<br/><br/>Richard Gere acted as the business man who wasn't ready for a new love, especially a hooker as a lover. It was amazing though how he found it in his heart to love one that didn't come from the same side of town as he did. Very sweet and touching if you ask me.<br/><br/>Both Roberts and Gere made a creative pair in the movie. They made the movie seem so believable. With out them two in the movie, the movie would have flopped at the box office. Their acting skills was what made Pretty Woman so touching, tender, funny, and real. Props to them all the way!<br/><br/>Summing up, Pretty Woman gets a 10 from me. It made me believe that anything is possible. Dreamers do have dreams that come true and real love doesn't always pick two people who come from the same side of town."

","I can't remember the first time that I saw it but whenever it was I was hooked. It's a classic fairytale of course with the hooker twist. When I was in college we had to look at this movie for a Advertising and Society class and analyze it. We touched on the begging scenes with the street person saying `Hollywood the land of dreams' and of course at the end when Vivian's dreams came true. I think that is hands down the best performance that I've ever seen from both Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. She played Vivian with such heart and it was so cool to see Richard break down her walls. One of the topics that we covered in my class was continuity. I know that I'm not the only one who noticed that during the scene when they eat breakfast for the first time we see her eating a pancake and when it cuts back to her she's eating a croissant. I laugh every time. <br/><br/>Pretty Woman is a love story that stands the test of time. 14 years later, I still watch it when it's on HBO. I watched it again about 2 weeks ago.

Romance in the form of 'Notting Hill' is easy to swallow and even enjoyable but a prostitute who lives happily ever after (or so it seems) is just laughable. Julia Roberts didn't even act that well so her Oscar nomination was just a lottery win but then again, the Oscars are just a platform for movie stars trying to prove they can act. Richard Gere didn't look and act much different than he did in his other roles. Hector Elizondo, by far, was the life of the movie as the kindly hotel manager who swoops down to Julia Roberts' aid when she comes in crying at being humiliated in a chic boutique. If the point of this movie was to give the prostitutes some credibility, it failed terribly. Just that annoying scene in the movie proved it - we women need a credit card and a man in our hand to rescue us from certain sacrifice in the hands of an upmarket store. Possibly, a decently dressed woman who couldn't afford the clothes wouldn't receive such treatment but she did because she was a whore and looked like one.

The only difference is she found someone rich and handsome enough to pay for her love, rather than just sex.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that on the voting scales, women consistently voted this higher than men. Men know the Richard Gere character deserves someone far better than some lowlife hooker, even if she is the overrated (I happen to think she's ugly) Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>But with women, it's the whole fairy tale they all desperately want to believe, that no matter how little they have to offer, no matter how low their standing in life, that their Prince Charming, their Mr. Perfect, their Knight in Shining Armour, or as in this movie, their Handsome Millionaire is waiting to sweep them off their feet.<br/><br/>Many women die lonely and bitter because of the myth this movie and others like it helps to perpetuate. But considering what they are expecting, it's hard to feel sorry for them... since they would have rejected and broken the hearts of many good, decent men while waiting for their dream.<br/><br/>I only wish I could vote 0 for this utterly vile piece of filth.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------end quote<br/><br/>All this is true, and despite it I couldn't wipe the stupid grin off my face.

Gere is a little lifeless at times, but I didn't have a problem with him for the most part. Hector Elizondo was, uh, sweet. Jason Alexander bugged me for quite some time. Laura San Giacomo was average.<br/><br/>The plot's decent, the writing's a little dull, and the the film seems to be three hours long or so. It did get very slow after a while.<br/><br/>
'Pretty Woman' is okay. It certainly isn't Roberts' best role or performance. It's something that I would watch twice and probably never again. That sort of thing."

","I know that this is an old film, but its great! The soundtrack song ""It Must've Been Love"" is a classic and works so well. The story of a rich guy falling in love with a 'poor' girl is a bit predictable but thats why I love it! Anyone who doesn't love this film has something wrong with them! This is one that should be in your video/DVD collection!"

","This is by no means a perfect movie. OK, so what are the chances that a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard would be this appealing?  What are the chances that she would actually come to mean anything to a rich classy guy? A more disturbing question: What is this movie saying on a moral level (especially to the teenage girls like me who watched it over and over when it was first released; this was before theaters clamped down on R-rated movie access)? Not that I think any girl is going to watch this movie and then go out and take up prostitution in hopes of meeting Mr. Right, but the question bears asking.<br/><br/>There are some very memorable lines and scenes (""the bad stuff is easier to believe"" still resonates with me, even though I'm no longer the trod-upon unpopular ""ugly girl"" I once was).  The supporting cast is definitely worth watching as well; I have an especially warm spot in my heart for Hector Elizondo because of his role as Mr. Thompson, and my husband was interested to see Elinor Donahue of ""Father Knows Best"", his childhood crush, in a bit part.  The soundtrack and score are nice.  All in all, it's a fun romantic comedy, if you're able to take it for what it is."
"smatysia","9","0","1","13 August 2002"," ""Take care of you!""
","A very entertaining film. It has its flaws, but you really don't care about them. Richard Gere re-animated a somewhat moribund career with this film by playing against type. His character is low-key, modest, quiet, and even a bit shy. And of course Julia Roberts in the title role really hit the big time with this one. She has such charm, such compelling charisma on-screen, that one doesn't notice her limited acting range. (Noticeably expanded by now, I'm speaking of her 1990 range.) For those who disparage Miss Roberts' looks, they seem immune to the spell she casts on me. True, her features are somewhat irregular, and she's a bit too thin, but that megawatt smile of hers covers every possible flaw. Laura San Giacomo did some of her best work here in a part that was regrettably much too small. Ditto for Hector Elizondo. Both came close to stealing the show, and would have definitely done so with a larger part, and a lesser performance by Roberts."
"shawn00","9","0","1","29 May 2002"," A Fun Romantic Comedy
","When it comes to romantic comedies, in my opinion, Pretty Woman is the standard. Every other romantic comedy since then has tried to match the magic formula that made this film so much fun.<br/><br/>So, what is that formula? Well, first, I have to be honest: I like adventure movies. I like movies with a plot, with something to figure out, with a bad guy to beat and an exciting road to conclusion. That being said, here is why I like Pretty Woman and why I think it's the best of its genre: It's got a clever story, great actors and a director that brought them together.<br/><br/>This is the role that defined Julia Roberts' career and she performed it perfectly. Vivian is smart, but not too clever, funny, but not a clown and charming, but not stuffy. You can't help but love this character, and that's a true testament to the actress that portrays her.<br/><br/>Edward (Richard Gere) is the complete opposite. He is stuffy, aloof and overly serious. The fact that Vivian changes that in him is the charm of this film. She goes from a pauper to a princess and he goes from a prince to a person. That's the magic!<br/><br/>Gary Marshall brings the characters and story to life in such a way that you can't help but enjoy this movie. Even if romantic comedies aren't your thing, Pretty Woman is for everyone. Just as the Excorcist defines horror and Star Wars defines sci-fi, Pretty Woman defines the romantic comedy."

","Edward Lewis is a rich, businessman who travels to Los Angeles for a business meeting. After meeting prostitute, Vivian Ward, Edward invites her to come and stay at his hotel for a week, so they can pretend there together in front of Edward's associates, etc. Vivian agrees. This starts of the beginning of a new friendship and a new relationship for both of them.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts gives a great performance as Vivian here. Richard Gere is okay, but a little annoying at times as Edward. Jason Alexander also gives a great performance Edward's friend Phil.<br/><br/>Pretty Woman is a pretty good romantic comedy with a cool cast involved. If you like the romantic, comedy movies like this and the leads here then Pretty Woman is for you."

"Josef Tura-2","8","0","2","15 June 2001"," Exactly as it should be
","This is a great movie, because it succeeded in what set out to do.  <br/><br/>It sets out to create a fairy tale and place it in a modern setting. The<br/><br/>characters know that this film isn't realistic, the audience knows it<br/><br/>and the movie makers knew it. Anyone who critiques this film for<br/><br/>not being realistic enough is missing the film's point. It is a myth<br/><br/>as old as human psychology and I see no harm in updating it for a<br/><br/>modern audience. The true test of the film is the chemistry of the lead actors and<br/><br/>the effectiveness of touching the core of the human longing for<br/><br/>something better. I found Gere, who is often painful to watch, to be<br/><br/>quite well matched with Roberts and I felt the story, although<br/><br/>sometimes trite, to be very effective in communicating the undying<br/><br/>Cinderella fantasy.  If one more user comments on this site to<br/><br/>remind us that dreams like these never materialize, I believe I will<br/><br/>scream.

","I remember back in 1990 how this film captured many peoples hearts, but the story is so hard to believe. This situation is uncommon in life. Richard Gere as businessman Edward Lewis who meets by accident a beautiful and carefree hooker played brilliant by Julia Roberts. Both teach each other about love and life. Different as light and dark with Edward being serious and Vivian always on the edge this shows love is possible for any person. That's why many like Pretty Woman so well because it is that they always hope for the rags-to-riches romance. I remember this best for the big superstar status it gave Julia Roberts."

"DeeNine-2","7","0","1","25 October 2000"," New spin on an old theme
","Pretty Woman is a popular and very familiar movie meant for a popular audience, the main attraction being the charisma of its two box-office buffos, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.<br/><br/>I always feel a certain sense of interest when anticipating a Richard Gere film. I know that in some way he will be slick and sleazy (e.g., Breathless (1983), Internal Affairs (1990), etc.) and I can get involved in his contrary nature. In other words, he won't bore me with a one-dimensional persona. Here however he is thoughtful, kind, considerate, intelligent--a non-sleazy, gray-suited business man with a wise and fatherly manner. Perhaps this is Gere's persona for his middle years...<br/><br/>In the case of Julia Roberts, not only is she nice to look at, she is interesting to look at. It is no accident that her face is one of the silver screen's dominate images from the nineties. She has a powerfully expression nature and can assume a role as easily as one puts on a coat. She is striking physically, the huge mouth, the delicate nose, the long limbs... She is also the quintessence of a woman who can appear ordinary or beautiful according to circumstances. I have seen her in two PBS productions of Nature. (Yes, she is a Hollywood star with compassion, or at least one who loves animals.) In one she is in Borneo with orangutans, and in the other in Mongolia with the descendants of Genghis Khan and the wild horses. In both cases she throws herself into the dirt and discomfort like a trooper without a hint of the glamour she left thousands of miles behind. She charms both the children of the nomads and the orangutans. In fact, one randy orangutan becomes so smitten with her that he starts to put the moves on, and has to be restrained! In other words she has an equalitarian, democratic, down-to-earth nature which sits well with a popular audience. She has made so many movies lately (hurriedly as her youth is expiring: she is now over thirty, the age of death for most Hollywood actresses) that I cannot keep up with them, so many that her ranking among the great stars of the screen is still up for grabs as we evaluate her many performances.<br/><br/>Will her role in Pretty Woman help? Although I found it difficult to swallow her fake bad grammar, the phony lack of sophistication, and the predictability of her golden heart, I thought it marginally plausible that such a striking woman COULD in some strange parallel universe be reduced to hooking in Hollywood. And I thought she did a creditable job by bringing some originality to a well-worn role. Certainly I believed in Julia Roberts, the whore, as much as I did in Elisabeth Shue, the whore (from Leaving Las Vegas (1995)). Had Roberts been portrayed as a drug addict--which of course Hollywood made a stringent point of NOT doing, since they needed Middle America to identify with her in order to sell tickets--I might have bought it. Most American prostitutes are drug addicts. That's how most of them they got enslaved into the business in the first place.<br/><br/>So what we have here is a variation on an old Hollywood fantasy: poor, underclass girl, through her natural beauty, lovable nature and good common sense wins the heart of a man of considerable means, thus upgrading her social and economic status, etc. In others words, this is a woman's fantasy-fulfillment movie all the way. The real question to be asked, though, is how did the chemistry between the two stars work? Do Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have anything to be jealous about? I think not, but judging from the box office success and the fact that they were paired again in Runaway Bride (1999), I am probably wrong. But see it and judge for yourself. Despite the cliché situation, this is more than a confectioner's diversion because of what it implies, and what we can learn, about the American psyche, circa 1990.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Get some hunky actor who falls for this woman, they have a bust up and then in the end after some soul searching the man sweeps her of her feet.
