","Much has already been written about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances. Solid and true, yes. They both deserve enormous accolades, Golden Globe and AMPAS-worthy, for these transformations and the effort of their craft. But I think the true heroes of this project are the Producers who took a chance on such dicey subject matter. Some reviews hail the project as ""A Crowd Pleaser,"" and yet, you realise, these are TRULY marginal characters, and not entirely likable, as some have already said, in an Era (1970s-1980s early AIDS crisis) that is nearly forgotten in this age of HIV exposure-as-a-managed-care-condition, rather than a death sentence, as it was between 1979-1995. As much as this could be a feel-good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktails, it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well-captured or documented adequately in quite some time. BRAVO to the Producers of this movie for giving this project the Greenlight, because the sexually-active youth of today would never know the Plague and tragedy that preceded their coming-of-age without a reminder like this."

","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not unusual for an actor or actress to alter their physical appearance for a movie role. Sometimes those changes become the story: Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Christian Bale in The Machinist are two that come to mind. Regardless of the transformation or make-up, what really matters is the performance and the character. Just ask Eddie Murphy (Norbit) or Gwyneth Paltrow (Shallow Hal). In The Dallas Buyers Club, we actually get two incredible transformations that lead to two stunning performances.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto each lost approximately 40 pounds for their respective roles as Ron Woodroof, the redneck, three-way loving, alcoholic, drug-addicted electrician/rodeo cowboy; and Rayon, the sensitive, street-savvy, would-be transsexual so desperate for a kind word. Their physical appearance will startle you more than once, but is quite effective in getting across the struggles of those infected with HIV virus in the 1980's. The numbers impacted exploded and the medical profession was ill-equipped to properly treat the patients.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story and a real life guy (Woodroof) who became a most unlikely beacon of hope for AIDS patients. Woodroof fought the medical industry, Pharmaceutical companies and the government (FDA, DEA, IRS). It's impossible to miss the message and accusations that most of these had a single goal of increasing profits, rather than curing the disease. And that's where the story lags a bit. Michael O'Neill and Dennis O'Hare are the faces of greed and bureaucracy, while Jennifer Garner, Leto, and Griffin Dunne represent the side with a heart. Woodroof seems to be a guy who just doesn't want to die, sees a business opportunity, and even learns a little bit about humanity along the way.<br/><br/>There have been numerous other projects that deal with AIDS, including: Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and the recent documentary How to Survive a Plague. This may be the first with a protagonist who is simply unlikeable, despite his passion and strong survival instincts. McConaughey doesn't shy away from the homophobic personality and cruel manner of speech that Woodroof possesses. We never doubt his frustration at those controlling the big picture, but we never really see him connect with those his brash tactics help.<br/><br/>McConaughey is on a dream run as an actor right now, and it certainly wouldn't be surprising to see him garner an Oscar nomination. But it would be a mistake to chalk that up to his losing so much weight - he really delivers a character that we won't soon forget. And let's not overlook Mr. Leto, who has been away from acting for 4 years touring with his band. He is a remarkable talent and a true screen presence. Compare this role to his Mark David Chapman in Chapter 27. It's not just the range of weight, but moreso the range in acting that so impresses.<br/><br/>Also worth noting here is the outstanding cinematography of Yves Belanger. This movie is shot in a way that brings out the intimacy of the moments, while not losing the big picture. Director Jean-Marc Vallee (The Young Victoria) and co-writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack work together for a solid foundation, but it's McConaughey and Leto that we will most remember ... and of course, the pics of the great Marc Bolan on the wall. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com"
"Rebel_With_A_Cause_94","9","187","221","20 November 2013"," A Facisnating True Story with Gritty Realism and Excellent Performances
","One of the best films I've seen this year! A raw, gritty, and incredible true story about a HIV diagnosed man who went to extraordinary lengths to survive at a time when the AIDS epidemic was at it's worst.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey who lost a significant amount of weight to play the role gives the performance of his career along with Jared Leto who's equally as good here. The two give quite possibly the best performances I've seen in a film all year in which I actually forgot I was watching actors in a film and instead felt as if I was watching real people. There's no doubt they will both receive nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>While this kind of story does feel a bit familiar overall, it's excellent screenplay and sense of realism along with the excellent performances make up for it. While it's defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch, it's a truly inspiring (and important) true story and one of the years best films.<br/><br/>McConaughey has been made out to be a bit of a laughing stock after starring in a series of really mediocre films. His recent performances however, have shown that the man truly is one of the best actors working in the business right now. Dallas Buyers Club is only further proof of this."
"lucasnochez","8","133","167","11 November 2013"," Review: Dallas Buyers Club
","Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010,  Matthew McConaughey's body of work was just that, a body that worked  well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of  romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996,  McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher's A Time To  Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like,  critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.  In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman's The Lincoln Lawyer,  a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some  of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in  what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent  memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be  casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.  While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time  span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of  McConaughey's unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and  proud Texan accent. And while I can't really imagine how a cowboy like  himself was cast in Christopher Nolan's upcoming science fiction  Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in  heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient  Ron Woodruff.  For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally  well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron  Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra- macho, bull-riding, money  throwing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling,  chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and  his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn't  until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized,  giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives  of many others.  Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty  day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his  hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested  medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of  AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United  States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a  close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the  ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced  doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral  treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic  money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the  realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working.  Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the  two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for  paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the  FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks  to Rayon's introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic,  homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his  opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual  discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors  physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey's drastic  forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty  amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon.  Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and  grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004′s indie The  Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical  spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a  candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal  struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the  United States in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and  edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for  wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic.  Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to  be a part of.  Although the year's lead actor category is going to be a full one at  this year's Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a  clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their  is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon.  His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a  large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto's  dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will  surely be rewarded.  Dallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting  effects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of  the United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park  living American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not  AIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government  fine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful  companies is wealth, or health.  Gritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic  based on a true story. Woodruff was a simple man, whose unfortunate  condition brought forth an incredible man who's zest for life inspires  others. Ron Woodruff definitely rode the bull in life; challenging the  powerful FDA, pharmaceutical companies and notions that were instilled  in his since birth. Thankfully for us, Vallee, McConaughey and Leto  ride the film into a place in our hearts, in an overly sexualized,  passionate display of what it's like to die ""with your boots on"";  dirty, gritty and with a fighting chance."

","After being diagnosed with HIV, electrician Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) learns he only has 30 days left to live. After getting an illegal supply of AZT, Ron finds that this isn't doing anything to help him. Eventually fleeing to Mexico, Ron learns of and begins to take a particular drug that hasn't been approved in the U.S. When he finds that this drug is improving his health, Ron sees an opportunity. After smuggling the drugs across the border, Ron, and another HIV patient named Rayon (Jared Leto) begins selling the drug to other citizens with the virus. During the process, Ron battles the medical field and the law in order to prove how beneficial his buyer's club is.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of the real Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club follow one man's actions on his mission to survive and how he started a revolution in a time when HIV/AIDS was a major issue. The story itself, not only is interesting, but it doesn't contain a dull moments. It filled with dramatic elements with dashes of comedic moments. It also features characters that we come to find ourselves close to. Every one of which gets their own time to shine. The film does jump around quite a bit, but it does so for the sake of the story and the events that are to come, and through every major point in Woodroof's life and battle with HIV.<br/><br/>Among the cast is Matthew McConaughey who easily gives the performance of his career as the blunt and clever Ron Woodroof. McCoaughey conveys different aspects of Woodroof with such ease. There are moments where he portrays Woodroof as being tough as nails, but then he can instantly shift gears into his emotional side. The comic relief aspects also come off completely natural. Jennifer Garner stars as Woodroof's female doctor friend Eve Saks. Garner does a fine job of giving off her charm as she always does, but with this performance we see the conflict her character is battling between her career and doing what is right. But the one actor who stands out the most is Jared Leto as the cross-dressing Rayon. Leto provides not only a lot of the major comic relief, but he also brings the heart of the story. We are shown Rayon as this carefree, happy-go-lucky character, but eventually we are shown just deeply affected this disease brings him emotionally, and Leto brings all of this to the table flawlessly.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is completely deserving of all of its Oscar buzz. From its powerful story, to its outstanding performances by the two leading males. Whether or not it is or isn't nominated for the 2014 Oscars, it is a film that has to be seen.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10"
"PWNYCNY","10","108","141","26 November 2013"," Outstanding movie about important themes.
","This movie is wonderful. It contains all the elements of a great movie. It has a strong script, excellent acting, compelling themes and terrific cinematography. This movie contains what is probably Matthew McConaughey's best performance. He carries the movie. He is in just about every scene. The movie deals with several themes - AIDS, terminal illness, government regulations, response to crisis, change of life issues, homosexuality, promiscuity, personal responsibility, and capitalism. All these themes are treated forthrightly.After watching this movie, one should come away with a better understanding and appreciation of the issues raised. But although the movie touches on themes that have political implications, it is first and foremost a drama. Although the movie takes some literary license, such as frank depictions of sickness and drug abuse, none of it is gratuitous. That is, it adds to the story."
"cait-853-774305","10","139","187","24 November 2013"," Matthew McConaughey...A STAR IS BORN
","At times Mr. McConaughey's acting abilities may have been in question, but doubtless there has always been a genius just waiting to explode. And explode it does in Dallas Buyers Club. Given a fully explored and developed character, he is the centrifugal force of the engaging plot of an American tragedy, seamless direction, lively dialogue and creme de la creme supporting actors. This actor, who proves he can blur the lines between acting and real, rises to the ranks of Dustin Hoffman, Sean Penn, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, our Grand Pere, Jack Nicholson, and his own idol, Paul Newman. Unquestionably, he deserves a spot in Academy Awards for Best Actor. At long last, given the opportunity, he has proved to possess truly exquisite talent; to be an actor's actor, worthy of study, deep respect, even awe. He skillfully brings to life an oddball cowboy character to the level of hero, and mesmerizes the audience at every single breath, by every stretch of his emaciated gorgeous heart, soul and body. Shirts off to Matthew McConaughey, and may you never doubt his abilities again."
"robert-259-28954","10","117","158","4 December 2013"," The best movie I've seen in years.
","After watching this film, I've run out of glowing superlatives to describe it. First of all, a word on Matthew McConaughey. I've always thought of him as a relative lightweight in the film world, the sexy leading man best designed for selling tickets and little else. I am happy to report that I was mistaken. Sadly, horribly mistaken. From the very first frame of this amazing movie, I was so amazed at his physical transformation that it took a half an hour just to adjust my eyes to the frail creature I saw before me. But it was real, just as his stellar performance both illuminated the way I look at the entire AIDS epidemic and the toll it takes on humanity, both gay and straight. This film happily avoided all previous clichés and typical treatments of the subject matter, transcending every other film I have seen regarding HIV/AIDS. For so long I have decried the serious lack of great film for ADULTS, with seemingly everything out today designed for pre-pubescent teenaged boys interesting in nothing more than mindless video games and moronic super hero sequels. As with many memorable independent films, this gem was elevated to heroic status with the incredible acting of McConaughey, in concert with the amazing Jaret Leto, providing the perfect foil to his perfect, character-driven role. Every, single reason for going to the movies is present in the glorious truth and humanity of this landmark effort, a ""must-see' for anyone seeking superior acting in profusion. If there's a God in heaven, Matthew and Jaret should both win the Academy Awards for Best Performance by a Leading Man, and Best Supporting Actor. Each actor went far beyond mere ""acting"" in this film, becoming so entirely immersed into character that they stopped acting and just BECAME. Don't miss this important and moving film."

In fact I jus saw this movie again on hbo, at 2 am. I dint got the time to write the review when I first saw the movie. I m writing this while am watching it on hbo. It's a sad thing that the cbfc here in India plays a spoilsport by censoring all the English movies even if it's aired after 1 am, while ignoring the trash bollywood item songs openly broadcasted in daylight. Fucktards, never cut the violence portrayed in bollywood movies but all action n horror movies are chopped here. Fucktards even went on to delete scenes from the girl with the dragon tattoo that too in theatres. Good Daniel Craig refused to allow that to happen. But ultimately it's people who wants to watch, they are deprived. Coming back to the movie, it was a very good movie with excellent acting and editing."
"howard.schumann","9","81","109","17 November 2013"," A brilliant performance
","At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, patients were advised to wait. In the six years following the first recording of the AIDS outbreak in 1981, more than 40,000 people in the U.S. died while waiting. In response to the clamor for action on the AIDS crisis, then Vice President George H.W. Bush has been quoted as saying ""If you want change, change your behavior."" Roger Ebert recalls, ""Politicians did not want to be associated with the disease. Hospitals resisted admitting victims, and when an AIDS victim died, some health-care workers would place the body in a black garbage bag. Funeral homes refused to accept the corpses."" <br/><br/>As described in David France's documentary How to Survive a Plague, activists such as the New York-based organization ACT UP began to protest against the government's callous indifference, challenging the FDA to change their drug approval procedure and the pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices and speed up their research process. In addition to the organized group protests, individuals also did their part and the determination of one unlikely crusader, electrician Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a homophobic ""good ol' Texas party boy,"" is the centerpiece of Jean Marc-Vallée's gritty and hard-hitting Dallas Buyers Club.<br/><br/>Written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and based on real events, it is the story of Woodroof's personal struggles after being diagnosed with AIDS and his efforts to spread public awareness of the disease and help reduce the suffering and extend the lives of AIDS patients. As the film opens, the heterosexual, drug-using and unabashedly promiscuous Woodroof receives the bad news from his doctors that he only has thirty days to live. Reacting with vitriol, he storms out of the hospital, cursing and making homophobic slurs while accusing the staff of making the wrong diagnosis.<br/><br/>After thoroughly researching the disease, however, and accepting the idea of his serious illness, Woodroof hears of a clinical trial for the new drug AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United States. His attempt, however, to become one of the participants is denied and he has to purchase the drug surreptitiously from an orderly. Unfortunately, he soon finds out that the dosage of AZT he is taking is toxic and his condition worsens. Refusing to give up, he visits an unlicensed American doctor (Griffin Dunne) in Mexico who has had some success with alternative treatments such as vitamins and protein-based anti-viral drugs.<br/><br/>Smuggling non-FDA approved experimental and alternative medicines into the U.S., he creates a business that allows him to distribute the drugs free of charge to AIDS patients who pay a monthly membership fee to join his Dallas Buyers Club, one of many such clubs that sprang up around the country. Woodroof is assisted in his venture by the drug-addicted transsexual Rayon (Jared Leto), a fellow patient that he met during his hospitalization. Though the film's depiction of Rayon does little to break the gay stereotype, their mutual engagement in helping AIDS victims helps Ron see his business partner in a different light than on their first meeting.<br/><br/>With the help of a sympathetic doctor, Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), Rayon and Woodroof work together while dodging Food and Drug Administration enforcers and the wrath of the pharmaceutical companies. In one of his best efforts, Matthew McConaughey, who lost 40 pounds for the movie, delivers a brilliant performance as the emotionally volatile but basically decent Woodroof. Though ultimately, not all alternative drugs proved to be useful, Woodroof and Rayon's determination in the face of powerful interests helped paved the way for development of new treatments, even though it took until the late 90s to come up with one that was fully effective. As a result of their efforts and that of countless others, HIV is no longer the death sentence it once was."

","In 1985, in Dallas, the homophobic electrician and rodeo rider Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a smoker and cocaine and alcohol user that frequently has sex with hookers and promiscuous women. When he faints in his trailer, he is sent to the hospital where Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) and Dr. Eve (Jennifer Garner) tell him that he is HIV+ and will die within thirty days. Ron also meets the travesty Rayon (Jared Leto) that is drug addicted that also has the disease. <br/><br/>Ron does not accept the diagnosis since he is not homosexual but a couple of days later he realizes that the diagnosis may be accurate. He researches about the disease and learns that AZT might be lethal for infected people. Further, he discovers that in Mexico there is a doctor with revoked license named Vass (Griffin Dunne) that uses alternative drugs in the treatment of AIDS. Ron improves his healthy and decides to sell the drugs in Dallas. He makes a partnership with Rayon and soon he creates the Dallas Buyers Club, where the memberships pay four hundred dollars per month to have the necessary drugs. But the FDA does not accept his research and he is oppressed by the authorities. <br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a great movie based on the true story of a terminal man infected by HIV+ that fights against the system to prolong his and his clients' lives using drugs not accepted by the FDA. Matthew McConaughey deserves his Oscar and it is impossible to recognize Jared Leto, also awarded with an Oscar. The story also denounces the participation of the pharmaceutical industry and doctors in the United States of America using unethical procedures to test and sell their drugs. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Clube de Compras Dallas"" (""Dallas Buyers Club"")"
"majic-5","8","64","94","7 December 2013"," Two shining performances

Both lead actors give sparkling performances, and in scenes where they share the screen, you might need sunglasses to handle the sun-bright intensity.<br/><br/>Of note is that this entire film was shot in only 23 days and Leto, in particular, said in an interview on the Daily Show, that he didn't have much time to rehearse, making the performance even more impressive. The only detraction was Jennifer Garner. She barely projects the authority of a nurse, let alone a doctor, even though female doctors in the 70's (and maybe today) were second-class citizens."
"bob the moo","Null","12","15","8 February 2014"," Consistent and engaging story told with a strong lead performance and a refreshing lack of sentimentality
","This film came to the UK with the usual awards hype that seems to accompany any number of bigger films that are released around this time, but I had made an effort to avoid it and didn't know too much about it other than McConaughey being talked up about his performance. Indeed I had ignored it as much as I could and to the point where I really knew the barebones of the plot – which was to say it was a true story of a guy who got HIV and, frustrated by the lack of medical treatment at the time, decided to start running effective drugs unapproved by the FDA across the Mexican border into the US. With this very basic grasp I did worry that the film would be sentimental, making a hero of the main character, playing up the plight of the infected and generally being the sort of film they wheel out for awards at this time of year, ticking all the topics off that gets voters onboard.<br/><br/>Happily the truth is that, although there is an element of this, the film doesn't overplay to this side of its nature and instead delivers a remarkable straight telling without too much excess. The character of Ron is a hustler first and everything else second and this doesn't change once he finally gets through the ""bargaining, anger, denial, acceptance"" stages of his diagnosis. As a result his efforts to bring in the drugs are not done out of some selfless act of wanting to help others as he prepares to meet his maker, but rather as part of his own fight for life he hits on a scheme to make money – and for the majority of the film this is the case. This central truth to the character really works to rob the film of sentimentality of him and therefore of the wider situation and it makes for a better film because we are engaged because we are interested rather than becomes a sweeping musical score or ""Oscar clip"" moment tells us to feel something. It does still do this and it does still bring out the sense of people struggling to live while the structure supposed to help them does little about it, but it does so in a way that is refreshingly free of smaltz.<br/><br/>Although this is a strength, it should also be said that the film doesn't manage to bring it all together as well as it should given the subject matter. It just feels like it falls a few steps short of greatness in terms really delivering an emotional punch that informs on the individual and the bigger picture at the same time – it does do this, but it is more consistent rather than building to this. Despite this it still works and although it lacks these real highs of delivery, it was functional and successful and I appreciated the lack of easy sentiment. The performances match this and in particular McConaughey gets the tone of the film and by return sets it. He is great, not because of the weight loss but because he delivers an unsympathetic character and convinces as him whether he is raging in denial, hustling or hurting. He is the heart of the film and it works as well as it works thanks a lot to him. The support characters are never more than supporting though, but of course Leto is strong in his role – not because he cross-dresses, but because he is the character and he makes Rayon about much more than the appearance. Zahn, Garner, O'Neill, Dunne and other recognizable faces all do solid work but primarily this is McConaughey's film.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club may not be perfect but it is consistent and it is engaging. I appreciate that it never resorts to easy smaltz or cheap sentimentality and it seems perfectly fine with its flawed character being flawed throughout the film. It is a well told story which links well from the individual's story into the bigger picture, even if it doesn't quite impact at that level as it could have done. Within the solid and effective frame of this story, McConaughey then seals the deal with a really strong lead performance as he takes yet another massive leap away from being that guy leaning against the title on the bus poster."

Half-way through the film, my friends and I looked at each other, in a bit of disbelief, unanimously agreeing that McConaughey deserves an Oscar for this. Jared Leto is also wonderful as Rayon, an AIDS-infected transvestite patient that will become a great friend and business partner, and that will trigger Woodroof's change of vision towards homosexuality. And it is not drastic. It comes in all kinds of subtleties and heart-warming moments. Hats off to Jennifer Garner as well, she is flawless.<br/><br/>Without ever offering a heavy-hearted tone, this is a story of perseverance and positivity with an interesting setting that sheds some light on an often forgotten page of history.

In Mexico he gets introduced to new drugs that help with HIV and AIDS but they are not FDA approved. Here starts the battle of Woodroff VS the FDA. He starts his own club where he treats people with AIDS and HIV, thats the main plot.

Some even thought he was gay, or at least bi. (Interviews with these people can easily be found online). In choosing to depict Woodruff as a redneck homophobe Dallas Buyers Club rather self-consciously opts for an unquestionably straight hero, while almost entirely airbrushing gays out of the picture. It also defames a real life hero who has nobody left to defend him. The truth, of course, is that the Dallas Buyers Club, like many similar ventures at the time, was largely run by gay activists. But they are nowhere to be seen here. Instead, we have the titillating composite figure of Rayon, the transvestite with a heart of (Oscar) gold. Again, interesting that the filmmakers opted to replace all those real life gays with a star turn for an actor in a dress. <br/><br/>Many reviewers have been happy to describe this movie as sensitive or daring or brave. In fact, it's just another piece of Hollywood exploitation, as timid and untruthful in its way as Philadelphia, and far more concerned with being a showcase for actors than with the truth of the story it purports to be championing."

","Before it seems that my ""review"" seems one-sided and completely negative, I want to emphasize it shouldn't take away from the performances from the two lead actors. I think they have done an excellent job overall.<br/><br/>My major criticism centers around the continuing inaccuracies of Hollywood and very simplistic portrayals of the complicated themes and issues affecting the players during the 1980s and 1990s during the US AIDS epidemic.<br/><br/>I understand the target audience is not going to need to know accurate history, certainly not in America, and also appreciate this is strictly intended for entertainment. I just find it ironic that political extremes always denounce propaganda while continuing to use it for their own means. I found the script very poorly done and wholly inaccurate with such severe bias after researching the real Ron Woodroof.<br/><br/>Conflicting information 1. Ron likely wasn't as extremely homophobic as portrayed. He was never as confrontational as depicted in the movie. He was also never in the rodeo. 2. All the treatments he was marketing were wholly ineffective in treating HIV/AIDS. Read for yourself on DDC (Zalcitabine) and others were downright harmful. In fact due to the lack of follow-up of the patients, many may have had an accelerated demise due to some of the combinations used (impossible to say of course). 3. The FDA had already loosened some of the restrictions on drug trials to fast track treatments. There were never any dramatic seizures like in the film. 4. Dr. Saks, who was horribly portrayed by Jennifer Garner and Rayon are fictional for dramatic elements only.<br/><br/>I could continue on. My issue is that proponents always say how great it is of Hollywood to raise awareness on a film. I appreciate this but it distorts history and harms how people react to ongoing crisis if this should arise again. It is like trying to pass on an action movie as based on a reality when we know it should be purely for entertainment."

","Great movie. Moving in its take on homophobia, intolerance and ignorance and damning in its take on government regulation, rigidity, corruption and stupidity. The big drug companies don't come out of this unscathed either.<br/><br/>The most powerful and moving aspect, however, is the transformation of an everyman into a champion for the greater good. (Admittedly, however, his motives were also commercially driven). While some people might have let their circumstances overwhelm them, he fought back.<br/><br/>Superb performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. McConoughey's role was the bigger one but Leto's was tougher (and, to a certain extent, possibly more fun!). Both of them had to make significant changes to their physical appearance for their role.<br/><br/>If ever somebody doubted McConaughey's abilities as an actor, this will put them to rest. Certainly, his 90s-to-mid-2000s roles relied mostly on his physical appearance and were more style than substance (A Time to Kill was the exception) but with his last few roles (this and True Detective especially) he has shown himself to be an actor of substance. <br/><br/>Supporting cast are OK, but not great. Jennifer Garner is the weak link in the cast. Not terrible, but she just doesn't seem to have the right presence or believability. Hillary Swank would have been a lot better for the role (and was originally cast, apparently, but had to pull out due to a scheduling conflict).<br/><br/>The only negative is that certain details, important to the plot, seem glossed over. I sometimes felt like a major moment had too little lead- up or background. More detail, even if it made the movie 30 minutes longer, would have been welcome."

","Dallas Buyers Club (2013)<br/><br/>What starts as an interpersonal drama with Matthew McConaughey leading the way, ends up as a more hard-hitting social message film with historical roots. It's about survival, accountability, American entrepreneurship, and AIDS. And McConaughey as Ron Woodroof is quite perfect, an amazing role played with a perfect mixture of restraint and excess as required.<br/><br/>It's necessary to mention as a secondary play Jared Leto, who plays a transgender woman, Rayon, also with AIDS. Woodroof overcomes his apparent homophobia to embrace Rayon as a partner and friend. Playing this kind of ""type"" might seem easy—like playing a racist sheriff or a grumpy old man—but Leto makes it complex and fair to that kind of person. (By the way, Rayon is fictional and Woodroof is not. The main story is true, including the making of a buyers club based on a model in New York that skirted laws for awhile.)<br/><br/>This is a movie ripe for praise and criticism both. It digs into an important subject and turbulent time. It also creates simplified versions of the people and their circumstances. Cries of inaccuracy (especially against the hospital, which is portrayed as pawn in the pharma corporate world) are fair but don't let them distract you. This is a drama, a dramatization, and it's well done to the heels. Beautifully rendered and truly filled with drama.<br/><br/>If the two actors deserve the most credit (and by extension the leading woman, a doctor played by Jennifer Garner, does not), the director needs to singled out here for capturing the feel of the times and the place (Dallas, filmed in New Orleans) so well. It's never distracting with affectation even as it is always interesting and colorful. And the story is told well and fast and without unnecessary sentiment."

","Homophobic, drug-addicted, alcoholic, womanizer, cowboy, diagnosed with AIDS, can all describe Ron Woodruff, the subject of Jean-Marc Vallee's new bio-pic Dallas Buyers Club. Matthew McConaugnhey plays Woodruff and has one of ""Hollywoods"" scariest body transformation every caught on film.<br/><br/>It's 1985 Dallas, Texas in the heart of local rodeo country. Upon being electrocuted on the job, Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey) awakens in the hospital to the news of him having contracted the HIV disease. After hearing of his thirty day life expectancy, Ron begins to find ways to procure the AZT drug, but when once his supply is up, Woodruff ventures to Mexico, where a non-licensed physician prescribes him non FDA approved drugs. With these drugs, Ron starts up the Dallas Buyers Club, where there is no fee for the medicine but there's a four hundred dollar monthly fee. <br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey gives the best performance of his career, next to his role in Jeff Nichols, Mud. McConaughey's transformation is hauntingly exquisite. The stages of weight-less is dominant in the film, from the opening scene of a sickly looking Woodruff having intercourse with two women in a rodeo bull pin, to his disturbingly thin, turkey neck after seven years with the disease. McConaughey will most certainly receive an Oscar nomination. There would be no Dallas Buyers Club without Rayon played by Jared Leto. Leto gives his best performance and with no doubt will be nominated for supporting actor. I was wholly absorbed in Leto's role. His transformation as a transgender male, battling the disease is frighting, note-worthy, and aggressively captivating. Jennifer Garner is also quite good in her role as Ron's Doctor. Steve Zahn, and Dennis O'Hare also provide fantastic minimal, supporting roles. <br/><br/>Jean Marc Vallee directs such a fine, touching film about a man with so much hate in his heart who grows, through his disease to learn to have an open heart and mind, which allows him to have true friendships with the unlikeliest of people. Such a remarkable film with so much heart, intuition, and bravery that should be enjoyed by everyone. <br/><br/>The film comes extremely heavy-handed in its subject matter, there will be the few who will hate the films pacing, but Dallas Buyers Club is one of the best films of the year. I give Dallas Buyers Club an ""A+"""

","In the front lines of transforming your physical appearance for the sake of the art, critics and audiences respond with gasps and eye-bulging at the shocking ""de-glamorization"" of our beloved Hollywood figures . Often times, it's used as a gimmick, lacking skill and talent to match the transformation. Christian Bale received lots of press leading up to and following his performance in Brad Anderson's ""The Machinst"" nearly a decade ago. Nothing about him or the film reached an epic proportion of legendary filmmaking or acting. Focus Features' upcoming film, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" executes solid imagery and profound performances that stands as one of the year's most ambitious efforts thus far. You can't knock anyone for trying to go for it.<br/><br/>Looking at what Matthew McConaughey achieves with the direction of Jean- Marc Vallée finally gives Hollywood and the rest of the world the realization of what an actor can do if they push themselves for the sake of the craft. It's not just a makeup trick, he embodies the soul of a broken man, reaching for a new-found purpose and demonstrating the human will to survive. McConaughey has hinted at this greatness for years now. He was in the realm of conversation last year as the lovable club owner in ""Magic Mike"" and impressed the lights out of many earlier this year with ""Mud"" from Jeff Nichols. Playing Ron Woodroof, a homophobic electrician that contracts HIV in the 1980's, the 43-year-old actor has tapped into an extraordinary and found humanity within a character that is often times unlikeable but continue to root for.<br/><br/>Vallée's direction of the story is impressive. He takes artistic liberties we haven't seen him attempt before and does a comparable job at bringing the unfocused and at times, jumbled narrative to the screen. Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack pen the script from an honest place. The ""Inspired by true events"" phrase that's plastered on the film's poster should have allowed a more cohesive and finely tuned story to be constructed. Their decisions on where to focus Woodroof's life during his first year living with HIV didn't give the film a thematic foundation to connect with. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching a socially political film that highlights the intolerance of homosexuals in the 80's or a politically-motivated drama that highlights the injustices that our own government takes on its people. You can make the argument that it's a blend of the two, but the way the events unfold and are represented don't necessarily ring authentic. If anything, they paint a poorly constructed portrait of homosexuals and victims of HIV and AIDS during a very difficult time in our nation where anyone was looking for an outlet of longevity. We know lots about the traumas and prejudices of our victims during the AIDS epidemic and the battles they fought just to simply live. There's no other message or values that the film presents that I haven't already heard in ""And the Band Played On"" and ""How to Survive a Plague.""<br/><br/>DBC-02693-RAs aforementioned, the performances in the film rise above any flaws that the script may slip into. McConaughey is the best I've ever seen him. Simply a delight from head to toe, beginning to end. What I haven't started to uncover is the revelation that is Jared Leto as the lovable and AIDS-stricken Rayon. Leto, who has been away from the game for some time as he focused on his music with his band ""30 Seconds to Mars"" showcases one of the year's finest turns and the best he's ever delivered. Every time the talented Leto is on-screen, he steals focus from everyone around him. He manages to illuminate the pain and horror of the human spirit as it deals the inevitable notion that fairly soon, you will die. You won't see a more devastating turn or a greater example of masking the real emotions of the being this year. A Supporting Actor contender has emerged.<br/><br/>DBC-00822-RThe beautiful and talented Jennifer Garner lays all she can into her role of Dr. Eve Saks, a doctor overseeing more than illnesses during the epidemic. While I will always remember her fondly in Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" in 2007, she simply doesn't have enough to work with to rally anything more than mere sympathy. Two co-stars, who are always great to see as the expand the filmography, is Denis O'Hare and Steve Zahn, both impeccable in their minimal roles.<br/><br/>As a whole, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is competent filmmaking executed by two outstanding performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Director of Photography Yves Bélanger is the best of the technical merits of the film. Aesthetically capturing tender moments from the side of a bed and the window of a car. Something that should be considered when looking at the film for awards prospects. At the end of the day, it's solid filmmaking. You can admire the attempt, but it missed some opportunities. I think the Oscar race has just added two solid contenders on its already growing list who are completely worthy of holding statues on the night."

","'DALLAS BUYERS CLUB': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Another likely Oscar contender is this biographical drama film starring Matthew McConaughey as an electrician/rodeo bull rider, named Ron Woodroof, who contracted AIDS (in Dallas in 1985) and started a business supplying many other victims of the deadly disease with the (unapproved) medication they needed. The film co-stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Garner, Steve Zahn and Denis O'Hare and was directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. It was written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and is based on a 1992 article, published in 'The Dallas Morning News', by Bill Minutaglio. McConaughey and Leto are almost guaranteed to get Oscar nominations (for 'best lead' and 'supporting' actor) and they deserve to. The film is a bit more of a long shot for 'best picture' but it's possible and would deserve that prestigious recognition as well. <br/><br/>The film begins in Dallas in 1985 when Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is told by doctors, while seeing them about a work injury, that he is HIV+ and only has 30 days left to live. Ron originally doesn't believe them because he, like many at the time, believed only homosexuals contracted the HIV virus. He's also extremely homophobic and outraged at the diagnosis (which he sees as an insult). After he learns more about HIV (and AIDS) he begins taking AZT (which he obtains illegally) but it only worsens his condition. He then travels to Mexico and meets Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne) who gives him the information and alternative medication (which is unapproved in the US) he needs to prolong his life and stay somewhat healthy. Woodroof then starts a business in the US supplying the medicine and vitamins to others, with the help of another AIDS patient he meets in the hospital (Leto). The FDA goes to war with him over this. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film because it's about rebellion and fighting the system and powers that be. In this case the system is the big business of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies, who are always purposefully keeping helpful medication from people in need in order to improve their profits. I also like movies with unlikeable characters that grow and learn throughout their journeys and become better people that not only end up helping themselves but many others as well. That's what Woodroof did; he started out only interested in money but ended up really wanting to help others. McConaughey is great in the film (in one of his best performances) and so is Leto. Garner is surprisingly good as well. The writing and directing is topnotch and it's just a very moving and inspiring film.

","Dallas Buyer Club is a great American biographical drama film! Co-written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. Set in the 1980s, the movie tells the story of a real-life AIDS patient, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) who smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS. Fighting against the orders of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ron must try to manage his 'Dallas Buyers Club"" while facing the opposition from the government agency that originally sent out to protect him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while the movie is based on true events, it's also highly fictional. A good example of this, is the supporting characters of Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), and Ron's transgender friend, Rayon (Jared Leto). Both were composite roles created from the writer's interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. While, some critics might see these examples of artistic license as offensive, due those whom resent the reinterpretation of real event historical events; I saw it as a huge colleague improvement. After all, both Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto did very well in their roles. Jared Leto even won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his accurate depiction of a fictional transwoman with HIV who helps Woodroof. To portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body to look the part. Nevertheless, it wasn't as extreme, as Matthew McConaughey had to go, through, as Ron Woodroof. McConaughey lost nearly 50 pounds, just to play the role in the film. The severity of the weight loss for these actors is getting way too dangerous. I can see McConaughey having problems, later in his life, because of this. Despite that, he was amazing in this movie. Kinda glad, he won Best Actor for this movie. However, while Woodroof was known for peculiar eccentric behavior, according to those who knew him; both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, with all the rampantly homophobic. Due to this, a lot of critics, believe that the portrayal of Woodroof in the beginning of the film, was very inaccurate and somewhat offensive, when many saw him, as a man that didn't harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. While, many of these real-life accounts are indeed mixed. Here is some truth about the guy. The real-life man did do hard drugs, and had a lot of sex, but also he was a family man, unlike the one, we saw in this film. I kinda do, hate the fact, that the movie cut this fact off from the story, because in my opinion, his ex-wives, family members and a daughter could help, push the character study, along, its character development. Despite all that, I do love, how the movie makes the main character transforms from a rotten person to a heroic one. Yes, he starts out as a homophobic, bigoted, promiscuous drug user, but he become very likable, over the course of the story, when he learns to take care of himself, eat healthy, and learns to appreciate and love others regardless of who they are. This is better than most tragic movies, are willing to give us. While, the movie's ending is bittersweet. I love the anti-corporate message demonstrated through drug companies' heartless action. It's true about what Woodroof says about the FDA. A good example of this, is the dangers of AZT when use to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. While, it's true that high doses of this drug is indeed toxic, it's also true, that AZT has worked for many patients at an appropriate dose. The use of AZT as a way to treat HIV/AIDS is still a highly target controversial, medical debate, even today. Just note that the drug does somewhat work, in small doses. Another good thing about this film is allowing the audience, in rethinking their apparent anti-gay sentiments. It indeed, changed a lot of opinions of straight people had on gay people. It also introduce mainstream audiences, to a realistic portrayal of transgender, outside of Comedy or Indies films. I love, how this movie was filmed. Lots of symbolism with the idea of riding the bull, sequences. Loves all the close up, and bait and switch camera movements as well. However, there were some historic inaccurate with some of the sets and props in this film. It's funny, noticing somethings in the background that clearly wasn't there in the 1980s. Overall: the diagnosis for this rodeo of movie has fine performances which are the highlights of Dallas Buyers Club, but you don't want to go believing too much of its history. The movie takes many shortcuts, compressing and compacting its story that it's hard to tell, which sequences are fiction and which are the truth. In the end, it's best for you to watch it, and judge yourself. I do recommended it."

","Having lived through the AIDS crisis, and having volunteered in the mid-80s with groups that were fighting AIDS, as I watched ""Dallas Buyers Club"" I kept wondering how true this ""based-on-a-true-story"" movie was. The idea that gay men rallied around a homophobic, heterosexual rodeo rider who despised the men he was ""helping"" just didn't ring true. So, I did some research.<br/><br/>There are good articles on the Huff Post, the Guardian, and other sites indicating that Ron Woodruff, the hero of Dallas Buyers Club, was at least bisexual if not gay (according to his wife, who should probably know), and got along well with gays. The prejudiced homophobe depicted in the movie is a fiction. The transgendered character, Rayon, is a fiction. The female doctor with whom Ron flirts is a fiction.<br/><br/>Fiction is fine, but why SO many ""fictions"" that fly in the face of ""truth""? I've read several reviews on IMDb praising the producers for having the guts to put such a difficult ""truth"" on screen. In my humble opinion, they've done the opposite. The truth is that gay men (including Ron Woodruff?) rallied and organized to fight HIV. While there were many concerned heterosexuals who helped, there were no homophobic cowboys riding their rodeo bulls to the rescue. But don't let the real truth stand in the way of creating a commercial product that can attract a wider audience and win a few acting awards for those involved."

Undoubtedly in the most outstanding performances of their careers Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are my favorites thus far for bringing home the goods at the Oscars for the nominations of Best Performance of an Actor in a Leading role and supporting roles respectively in the bio-drama DALLAS BUYERS CLUB.<br/><br/>If you had suddenly being told that you have only 30 days to live and that you have to make peace with this information how would you react? Rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) wakes up in hospital to this news which is shared with him by his attending physician. Woodroof who has been diagnosed positive of the HIV virus reacts to this revelation in anger. In fact it is this anger that fuels him to the distances that he reaches out for survival. Woodroof who was initially treated with the drug stated AZT did not respond positively to them. Instead the needle happy bull rider tried experimenting with medications and drugs to concoct his own special brew of HIV anti bodies, Strangely these events did lead him to certain discoveries that attracted the attention of the legal system whose waking wish was to shut him down. May it be money, may it be his human instinct to live, Woodroof along with Rayon (Jared Leto) did not give up which invariably resulted in the opening of the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB ; a business that dealt the FDA unapproved medication to HIV patients.<br/><br/>Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee has difficulty in controlling the rhythm of the screenplay and is wobbly at first. Trailer trash sex scenes and orgies and drugs engross the first hour of the movie which although has relevance to what Woodroof is all about did not contribute much to what the movie is entirely discussing about. Once Jean gets his feet firmly on the ground for a good 45 minutes with the actual matter the screenplay derails yet again when the battle between life and death becomes a political tussle in between Woodroof and the government. For starters the entire political involvement is abruptly handled with I would say less than 5 minutes of screen time and top of that to the audience it breaks rhythm and direction of the true struggle of Woodroof and Rayon. <br/><br/>What keep this loosely driven motion picture in balance are its two lead performers. The weight losses alone show the commitment and the help of makeup and hairstyling simple accentuates the entire performance even further. It's been sometime since a movie of this caliber has been in our midst. There is no room for excessive CGI. No room for artificial imagery and what we see is pretty much what goes on in front of the lens.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Exquisite work on the part of the leading men.

They do all the things required to win awards, but in the end, will this movie be remembered? I doubt it."
"MacTheMovieguy","10","4","5","23 July 2014"," heart wrenching enough, and inspirational enough, to make you stand up and cheer
","I will admit, as of the time I'm writing this review, I haven't quite seen every film of 2013. But as of this moment, I've seen 71 films, and Dallas Buyers Club is the best. Hands down. It's such a beautiful character arc for McConaughey that you can't ignore it, and the film itself is just heart wrenching enough, and inspirational enough, to make you stand up and cheer.<br/><br/>McConaughey is tasked with playing Ron Woodruff, a real-life cowboy, who contracts the HIV virus during the peak of the AIDS crisis, and when men like Ron Woodruff thought only gays could get HIV. Ron turns from being a lowlife uneducated hick, into a self-educated dreamer, who believes he has the key to keeping himself alive. After seeing a doctor who gives him 30 days to live, Ron embarks on a journey of self discovery, and learns more about the drug AZT than the doctors are willing to tell him. Ron finds research on other drugs, and alternative medicines that seem to be working, and he heads to Mexico to check them out. Ultimately, Ron decides to get these drugs back across the border. At first, it's so that he'll have them, and he can make money off of them. Then it becomes about sticking it to the doctors and ""big medicine"", but by the end of the film, Ron is clearly doing it for a more human reason.<br/><br/>A lot of that has to do with Rayon (Jared Leto), a crossdresser that Ron runs into while being treated for HIV. These two shouldn't get along, and they shouldn't be friends, but they need each other. Ron needs Rayon to help him distribute his drugs, and Rayon needs the drugs. Later, Ron needs Rayon as the only person he really trusts in the world, and Rayon needs Ron to be his ray of hope. Later, Ron realizes that Rayon is also his compass, and grounds him in this awful world where everyone around him is dying. Jennifer Garner rounds out the lead cast as Ron's doctor, a compassionate woman who herself is trying to figure out this epidemic, and whether or not AZT is more harmful than its worth.<br/><br/>Garner is fine in her role, but Leto and McConaughey shine. Both men lost an absolutely staggering amount of weight for their roles. They both embody the ""unhealthy dying"" look perfectly. Both men are completely transformative in their roles. This film was the opportunity of a lifetime for them, and they each succeed in giving an honest piece of themselves to the story. They are both wasting away on camera right in front of you, getting thinner and thinner as the film shoots. Leto as Rayon has some truly heartbreaking moments, one especially big one where he has to tell his father that he is dying of AIDS. There are Oscar moments riddled throughout. Both men have never been nominated, and I don't want to be in a world where they aren't nominated here for these performances.<br/><br/>I thought Dallas Buyers Club was the perfect amount of ""activist"" film mixed with ""tragedy"" mixed with ""stunning character piece"". It tries to be everything it can be, and actually succeeds, which is a rare feat for a film. This is a must-watch film for anyone who just likes to see a damn good movie."
"migueloliveira-16","7","4","5","30 January 2014"," Dallas Buyers Club
","I've been starting to watch more of Matthew McConaughey both in cinema and TV (True Detective) and I have to say that he is giving great performances. In this movie he's a man who's got a taste for alcohol, drugs and women and a hate about homosexuals. Then he discovers he's infected with AIDS and he's battling against it in any ways he can even if it means passing above the law. I don't really know if the movie is historically accurate because I haven't lived that years but in my view, even if it is not accurate, is a solid story, with a good written screenplay, and well acted. Jared Leto suffered a huge transformation for his role and adding to that delivered a good acting. Jennifer Garner is not very mentioned in the acting department but she should as she interpreted a doctor with her own doubts about medical care. Summarizing I liked it, it's not a must-watch but it is definitely a should-watch."

","Matthew McConaughey is the same guy he always plays, though at first a lot more homophobic, and maybe one of the worst human beings he has ever been, and he's played a lot of lawyers. It is a very well told story with a heart, and soul to match, no tears, just a tight story that stays on track. McConaughey's character is truly believable, and it makes sense that the only way things were going to get better was for people to stand up, and ignore what they were told to do, and do what they knew was right. Small time versions of this attitude are why there are states in America with Legalized Pot. I Enjoyed this story, like I said no tears, I was not pulled that strongly enough to care that much, but the story was solid, and true, and deserves to be told right like this. I would recommend this film as it has a lot of very strong, and important messages about people that we should all be more conscious of. It's not a heavy handed film though, you see some pretty sick folks, but things are handled well, and with true thought, and care."
"eplain-2","2","13","23","4 March 2015"," WAY over rated, & I wouldn't have awarded Leto.
","So many people speak ""about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances"", well, I disagree. These were 2 of the easiest roles to play (Especially Leto's). Any Baldwin brother could have done it (that's a dig, on both sides, yes it is). McConaughey loses a ton of weight and turns himself into a character so physically unappealing, I almost shut my TV off just because seeing him hit in Jennifer Garner was sort of gross (Not that she's a beauty by any stretch, but, well, it's a turnoff). Seeing his bare ass & testicles was less of a turnoff, and that's saying something. He forgets the old adage ""just because you CAN doesn't mean you should"".<br/><br/>Leto has the assistance of a ""million dollar"" team of makeup artists, and the work of those people should not influence someone to vote for him for an Academy Award. His acting was over the top at times and there was nothing appealing about his character, at all. Even evil characters can be appealing! make you love them and root for them, because hey! it's a movie. Leto hinges everything on the makeup, which by the way....was laughable most of the time, and that everyone knows Hollywood loves a flamboyant homosexual... you almost can't lose.<br/><br/>McConaughey... he gets to run through the halls of the Hospital going anywhere he wants at anytime screaming at people, yelling out every foul mouthed word he can, again NOT great acting as i see it. The character (again) NOT appealing, actually repulsive, you can't wait for him to stop, whatever it is he is doing, it's just too much. Again, you don't ever begin to ""love"" this....person. You don't like him, you don't even care for him. And it didn't help that he went from ""I want to save my life, to I am going to save all the AIDS victims in the world in about 1.5 seconds. Something was missing there.<br/><br/>This movie gets a 2, 1 extra point because ... I actually made it to the end! If you want to see a typical Hollywood movie where they twist the the facts a bit, re-write history (Just enough), make the children smarter than the parents, the patient smarter than the Doctor, The Mexican Doctor better than the American Doctor, the nurse smarter than the WHOLE hospital, the young wiser than the old, the defendant smarter than the Judge, the creeps of the world that can pass off as circus performers smarter than the EVERYONE above them.... well..... you get the point..... then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>PS- I watched American Hustle 3 times last month, I can't get enough of that movie and those characters!.

"bob-the-movie-man","9","5","7","20 February 2014"," Superb portrayal of a tragic period for health in the Western world
","After ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" I'd thought I'd seen all of the serious best actor candidates for this year. That was before I'd seen Matthew McConaughey's performance in ""Dallas Buyers Club"". The performance is simply outstanding: less showy that DiCapprio's in ""Wolf""; certainly less worthy than Ejiofor's in ""Slave""; but in my book, this would get my vote if I were an Oscar or BAFTA voter. He is nominated which is good: but he won't win I fear.<br/><br/>It is almost impossible to like McConaughey's character - Ron Woodroof - in this film. He is a racist, a bigot, a homophobe, a misogynist, a drug and alcohol abuser and has streaks of violence simmering just under his hateful and hating Texan skin. If there was anyone you would cross the road to avoid, it would be him. And yet McConaughey fills the role with such power and such passion he makes the story utterly gripping. Seldom have 2 hours flown by quicker in the cinema. There have been three physical transformations this year that have made you think ""that can't be good for him"": the first was Christian Bale's pot belly in ""American Hustle"". And then there's McConnaughey and co-star Jared Leto in this film. Clearly both have been on an extreme diet for a considerable period: less five:two and more seven:zero. Painful to watch: why do actors do this to themselves? The film, based on a true story, tells the story of Woodroof's fight to stay alive against the ravages of Aids in the mid-80s: he refuses to lay down and die, as all the doctor's predict, and goes on a one man crusade to identify and bring into the country - against the US Food and Drug Administration's approval - experimental drug combinations that will prolong his life. During this journey, of course, he comes into close contact with the gay community that in his previous life he so despised: and the mirror of his own past views is held up to him during his dramatic role-reversal through the reaction of his former 'friends' and colleagues to both himself and his new-found gay friends. This sets up a devastatingly powerful and emotional story.<br/><br/>Also of note are McConaughey's two supporting actors: Jennifer Garner as his doctor friend Eve and (particularly) Jared Leto as his transsexual friend Rayon: receiving a well-deserved Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>A word of caution for those easily offended: Dallas Buyer's Club features extensive sex and drug taking scenes, and whilst not as extreme as ""Wolf of Wall Street"", this is also perhaps another one not to take your maiden aunt or squirming teenage son/daughter to see. But for everyone else, this is a highly recommended film. Delightfully un-sugar-coated, thoughtful and gripping, and a triumph for the leads, the writers (Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) and Canadian-born director Jean-Marc Vallée (""The Young Victoria"").<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, ""follow the Fad"" at http://bobmann447.wordpress.com... thanks)."
"TiagoRicardo","9","6","9","3 December 2013"," A story about hope and respect
","It is really impressive the way that ""Dallas Buyers Club"" catches your attention. A remarkable and powerful story about a man with the HIV virus and who battles against the system to provide hope for those who see their life almost lost. The way that Matthew McConaughey plays his character is really impressive and it's one major factor that made me enjoy this movie more. It's a really powerful movie and one true contender to this year's Oscars. It's a movie about learning, about respect and about hope. The way that Ron's mind change about homosexuality provides also a certain touch of humanity and kindness to the story. With outstanding performances of Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is definitely a must-see!"
"StevePulaski","9","7","11","16 November 2013"," McConaughey should just live in the working class south from now on
","Dallas Buyers Club tells a classic anti-hero story concerning an ailing, homophobic bull rider who tests HIV positive upon visiting a doctor. He is told he has a mere thirty days to live. As expected, he brushes off the doctors warnings about being deathly sick, saying it's impossible for him to be ill because he is no ""daisy-puller"" and is straight as an arrow.<br/><br/>However, this stubborn arrogance will be both his drawback and, ultimately, his method for success. He becomes desperate, paranoid, and deeply self-conscious, making the decision to travel to Mexico to obtain a series off unapproved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs that he read about online. It's the 1980's, the HIV/AIDS scare is hugely prominent in pop culture, and FDA approved drugs seem to be doing more harm than good. Our anti-hero plans to show the public they're being poisoned, cheated, and lied to by an agency driven by profits and not the greater good of the American people.<br/><br/>Our anti-hero is Ron Woodroof, played, once again, by a stellar Matthew McConaughey, who has finally earned enough money where he can partake in films with ambition and a fabulous storyline (kind of like the opposite of Robert De Niro). This is only McConaughey's umpteenth venture into bonafide, working class, trailer park culture, with such winners as Bernie Killer Joe, and Mud already firmly secured under his belt. Once more, he gives a beautiful performance as an unlikable character doing unlikeable things, however, making us still appreciate and root for him in the end. He is assisted by the likes of a transgender female (Jared Leto, in perhaps the riskiest role of his career) and viewed uncertainly by his physician (Jennifer Garner), who is conflicted whether or not to allow him the luxury of running a buyers club, providing people with unapproved but helpful drugs, or to keep patients coming back to her hospital to provide them with sub-par care and assistance.<br/><br/>The writing team of Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack rarely take a wrong step in portraying Woodroof as a contemptible, but admirable man hungry for life, not survival. In order to do this well, they downplay all emotional significance in the film to vague hints the audience can take either way. Some scenes, we could definitely believe Woodroof is beginning to have feelings for his transgender partner. At other times, we can maybe sense a potential relationship between him and his physician. But Borten and Wallack have bigger fish to fry in a story with much more to it than a schmaltzy love story.<br/><br/>Politically, the film can be analyzed both ways. We can see that the aforementioned writing team and the directing talents of Jean-Marc Vallée may be trying to promote alternative medicine in America - a case which definitely needs to be made, and only makes more sense as we see its significance in the 1980's. In a country driven more by pharmaceutical sales than ever before, the case should be made for several kinds of alternative medicine, and having Woodroof's story portrayed on film is liable to spark conversation and even a debate about the benefits and the need for other options.<br/><br/>A scene in Dallas Buyers Club explains why this was tricky then and is even more tricky now, with corporate profits being at the forefront of concerns most of the time. Woodroof storms in on an HIV support group meeting, hooked up to an IV on wheels, when an agent of the FDA is speaking at the seminar. He states how these big, government-controlled corporations keep the real, beneficial drugs closeted and the research that proves their reliability hidden and instead approve drugs that act either as placebos or as weak solutions to a macro-problem. As expected, Woodroof is thrown out after less than a minute of sensible ranting, and this marks one of the many scenes in the film that will spark outrage and disgust amongst audience members.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club, thankfully, has numerous people behind it that takes its material seriously and see the wealth of social commentary the screenplay provides. Between a fearless and completely believable McConaughey as the lead, to Jared Leto's sensitive and heartbreaking performance as a man already ostracized in society with additional huge problems, the talents writing team, the equally intelligent director, and the softly-colored visual palette of colors, the film succeeds on nearly every level in terms of a biographical piece, an interesting drama, and, once more, the story of an anti-hero we simultaneously love and hate. The film's trailer included an amazing song by the band The Heavy titled ""What Makes a Good Man?"" and I simply can't think of a better song to summarize this movie's subject matter and greatness in terms of intimate focus on a character with a poor personality but a strong mentality.<br/><br/>Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Garner. Directed by: Jean-Marc Vallée."

","Sorry, but as a young man I watched friends and strangers live this scenario. The two male leads are fictionalized fantasies of the personalities of people that would have lived through this. Losing a bunch of weight to play a role does not make the performance real, or ""lived in"", or stellar. <br/><br/>Don't believe the hype of this film, it is only a film, a vehicle for people to further their careers. <br/><br/>The lead characters don't seem to live in, or inhabit the true nature of people facing their demise, instead it seems to be a vanity play for accolades and publicity. Sorry, nope, this film's reflection of this time never happened. This is not how real people were conducting themselves, this isn't how they acted, this film did not portray their human motivations and emotions accurately. This was a film that tells a dramatic story about a time when people died from a disease, and prejudice and incorrect information was everywhere, not a proper reflection of the reality. <br/><br/>Lest you think I am cynical, think again. The reality I witnessed in the eyes of people who were dying, who scrambled for anything to save their lives, was not portrayed in this movie. This film is nothing more than a dramatic story, about a real time in human history. <br/><br/>Let's not hype these performances by the leads as exemplary acting, because no person I met in those days ever acted like these two leads. But if you are a director, and never met real people who lived this reality, and then sought to make an ""actor's vehicle"" drama, -- you would create characters like these, characters that are neither accurate in their human condition, psychological motivation, or reality. <br/><br/>And if, as I suspect, there are some folks involved in this production who did live this reality, I would bet that when asked if this movie reflected the reality of the time they would answer likely answer, no, not at all."
"proud_luddite","7","2","2","12 October 2019"," A brave look back at the troubled 1980s
","This film is based on the life of Ron Woodroof, a drug-addicted Dallas rodeo cowboy who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. The film follows his journey from homophobia to a crusade of getting non-toxic medical treatments for him and his fellow AIDS-sufferers.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" can be praised for its fine job of recalling some of the most difficult times in the 80s including the ostracization of anyone diagnosed with AIDS regardless of their sexual orientation. Equally praiseworthy is its coverage of a negative situation that continues to this day: the collaboration of government medical systems with pharmaceutical companies who conspire to ban healthy treatments in favour of toxic drugs that harm patients as they create big profits. Placed in the negative spotlight is the U.S Food and Drug Administration as Ron imports healthy treatments from other countries.<br/><br/>In the lead role, Matthew McConaughey is very believable in all the character's contradictions including the transition from a homophobic redneck to a righteous helper of many gay men. His unlikely kinship with an MTF transsexual (well played by Jared Leto) is moving though a confrontational scene in a grocery store is a bit unbelievable. Jennifer Garner also does well as a young doctor who is caught between bureaucratic career aspirations vs. a more truthful way to serve others."

I went into the movie thinking ""Okay, another Oscar-winning movie to mark off the seen-it list,"" but came out with a dropped jaw! This movie closely resonates with me as I was born with a retrovirus that gave me all kinds of health problems, and the doctors didn't know what it was (thank goodness).

"ElMaruecan82","10","2","2","31 December 2016"," Doctors said he had only thirty days to live, but what do they know?
","2013 had its share of real-life stories from the over-flashy and needlessly indigestible ""American Hustle"" to Scorsese's very-entertaining-but-no-""Goodfellas"" ""Wolf of Wall Street"" and the respectable but polarizing ""12 Years: A Slave"". Here you have one biopic that could have easily fallen in the trap of sentimentalism or blind militancy but didn't, because the director Jean-Marc Vallee knew this was the sort of story to make half the film and needs nothing but honest storytelling, straightforward directing and great acting.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" tells the story of Ron Woodroof, a rodeo player, sleazy, coke and sex-addict and homophobic redneck, not a nice guy at all. Karma will play a dirty trick when a doctor diagnoses him with the HIV virus and doesn't give him more than thirty days to live, but Ron will not only contradict the prognostic but will live long enough to fight the pharmaceutical industry and provide AIDS-patients the medicine they really need. It's a long crusade against the major companies who test the effect of a drug named AZT, supposed to cure some cancer-like AIDS effects. Ron, who bribes a hospital worker to get AZT, discovers that the medicine only makes people survive for a short amount of time while the right doses of very specific drugs (vitamins and peptides) can make them live. The drugs are available in Mexico and other countries but they're still frowned upon in the United States. That's the situation.<br/><br/>This is not just a fight for health, but for the freedom to chose the way you want to cure yourself. Ron doesn't see himself as a crusader, he's just a man who acts and moves forward, he doesn't give a damn about what doctors said, he's practical, if a cocktail of drugs made him live long enough to survive the prognostic, he must blow the whistle and make the other patients know, the rest is only judicial matters and he can handle it. So, he opens his own business and sells drugs he manages to smuggle in exchange of a 400-dollar membership in the ""Dallas Buyers Club"". As time moves on, the membership implodes and proves the efficiency of the new treatment, to the point that his first treating physician, played by Jennifer Garner, questions the ethics of the pharmaceutical lobbies' methods.<br/><br/>What makes ""Dallas Buyers Club"" such a great story is that it never ceases to stop delivering information, it is a real enlightenment about the first years of AIDS and how it started to spread and be only perceived as a gay or junky disease, and what better way to show it from the perspective of a man who starts as homophobic. There's something of a poetic irony that Ron suffers the same rejection and, no pun intended, gets a taste of his own medicine. What we witness in the first and second act is a brilliant metamorphosis of an individual from a sleazy macho man act to a human being who over steps the bounds of discrimination and understands that the same way, viruses don't make differences, no person should. He changes and for the better. That's the stuff great stories are made of. It's not just about health but about dignity.<br/><br/>And even with such a premise, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" could have been a cheap emotional underdog story, but you never really see the transition because all through the film, this is Ron acting as a militant, smuggling, phoning, bribing, lying, disguising himself, confronting the doctors, the cops, the FDA, only near the end, you can see the metamorphosis. And the key to Ron's transformation is the character of Rayon, a young transsexual who's rejected at first, but eventually inspires Ron one of his first powerful reactions to homophobia. Any other film would've made It too preachy and obvious but here, it works because it's just plays it straightforwardly, without any hint of a possible agenda. It is about people.<br/><br/>And Matthew McConaughey delivers the performance of a lifetime as a man who wouldn't take crap from anybody because he's moved by the most basic human instincts: rage and survival. When he learns about the news, Ron goes through the five emotional stages of grief, he's in denial first, but then gets angry because he understand he screwed his life by having unprotected sex, he's scared and started with bargain, but then he's not resigned in the sense that he accepts his death, he's enraged because he knows people can at least live with the cure but aren't given the proper medication. Ron wants to live, he wants his friends to survive too, so nothing can stand between this thirst for living and his struggle, only AIDS can defeat him and he knows any month earned is a victory, and there's no defeat because it is not a fight to be ever over.<br/><br/>Watching ""Dallars Buyers Club"", I couldn't help but feel deeply attached to the protagonists, their sadness and anger, and I was shocked to see industrial big shots depriving people from their basic freedom. I don't expect everything to be 100% accurate but I want to believe it because I know humanity can be that cruel and cynical, and sometimes, the sleaziest persons can reveal themselves in such extreme situation. As sad as AIDS was for Ron, it made him a better man than he could ever lived had he not been HIV positive. It was a destiny and a magnificent one. <br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a powerful drama, served by spectacular performances and a great reminder of the suffering caused by AIDS on a psychological level, it even hit a personal chord because I had my share of worries and I will never forget how tasty the air felt when I was told that my test was negative."

","<a href=""/title/tt0790636/"">Dallas Buyers Club (2013)</a> is a great film for so many reasons but what will win your heart over is the level of authenticity and honesty shown in the various character portrayals. McConaughey and Leto are simply spellbinding in their roles - both completely immerse themselves into both the physical and psychological state of their characters and show just what commitment to a role should look like. Together, they bring a sense of realism that elevates this biopic to first-rate material. The way both themselves, as well as their relationship with one another, evolves is a sight to be seen and done plausibly so. The on-screen text is a wise technique that makes us feel the passage of time and so we can understand how McConaughey's Woodroof has transformed from the sleazy, impudent person he was to the compassionate, altruistic individual he becomes. The movie is marvellously executed with its great writing, compelling themes and beautiful cinematography that captures the run-down, gloomy feel of the Dallas neighbourhood. It feels almost as a place of regret, where people's dreams have died in its shadowy abyss. The town's sense of lifelessness contrasts the sheer determination and vitality of Woodroof, a hero who defied all odds and whose relentless effort to merely cure himself developed into an inspiring story that showed the effect one man's resilience can have on others."
"Mobithailand","9","2","2","10 April 2016"," You will feel uplifted by the film's portrayal of the indomitable human spirit. Go for it.
","This is a difficult film to watch, as the subject matter is very grim and it hails back to those scary, depressing years of the mid- eighties when people across the world were dropping like flies with alarming frequency, after contracting HIV-AIDS. Although there is still no absolute cure for AIDS, significant medical progress has been made since those terrible years and these days many people with access to the latest drugs are able to live almost normal lives for many years, and have pretty much normal life-spans.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of Ron Woodroof, a Texan homophobic electrician, and rodeo performer, who contracted AIDS in the early 80's. He was given thirty days to live by a local hospital but succeeded in remaining alive for seven more years by illegally importing and taking unapproved drugs. Along the way, he starts the Dallas Buyers Club, which is a device by which he is able to provide illegal drugs to fellow sufferers free of charge in return for paying a club membership fee. He also modifies his homophobic attitude and he strikes up a close friendship with a transvestite who becomes his business partner.<br/><br/>Rumbling along in the background of this tale is Woodruff's battle with the authorities, particularly the FDA, who have serious objections to his drug buying and distribution activities and continually battle to shut him down, put him in jail and deprive him and others of drugs that can clearly prolong their lives. It has taken more than 20 years to bring this story to the screen, which is hardly surprising, given the seemingly unappealing storyline. When it finally went into production, it had a scant budget of only $5.5 million and the entire film was shot in a mere 25 days.<br/><br/>Yet this low-budget film that was put together in less time than it takes most film producers to choose their cast has so far grossed $27million in the USA as at April 2014 and no doubt continued to put countless more 'bums on seats' in the following months. It garnered 6 Oscar nominations and won three, including Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a shining example of one of my favourite hobby-horses - that Hollywood doesn't need to spend obscene amounts of money to make good, successful films – but that's an argument for another day. In my opinion, Dallas Buyers Club succeeds because, in spite of the deeply depressing subject matter, it tells the story of a man who refuses to meekly accept his predicted demise, and rails against the bureaucracy and authorities who would have him pass away quickly and without a fuss. By taking things into his own hands, he not only prolongs his own life, but also those of his fellow sufferers. It is a classic David and Goliath story: a dying, badly educated, Texan hick, against the might of the American government.<br/><br/>But none of the above would have made the film stand out from the crowd if it wasn't for the quite extraordinary performance in the lead role by Mathew McConaughey. It really is a 'tour de force.' Not only did McConaughey look the part, (he lost so much weight that he must have been in imminent danger of collapsing from malnutrition), but he positively acted his hind teeth off.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, I did think that the portrayal of Woodroof's extreme and outrageously homophobic behaviour at the start of the movie was a bit over the top. If we accept the fact that he was a bigoted, ignorant Texan, it just didn't ring true (to me) that such an intolerant homophobe could dramatically change his ultra-extreme views in such a short space of time – even given the unique circumstances. To my surprise, after I had seen the movie, I found that my views are indeed valid.<br/><br/>Amongst others, there is an article in The Dallas Morning News, commenting on the accuracy of the film, which states that:<br/><br/>""people who knew him said that he was not homophobic While Woodroof was known for outlandish behaviour, according to those who knew him both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, describing him as ""outrageous, but not confrontational"" and not as obviously homophobic earlier in his life.""<br/><br/>The opening scenes, in which Woodroof is mind-bogglingly abusive towards gays and the gay community, are amongst the most uncomfortable to watch in the whole movie. I can kind of see the justification in showing a dramatic contrast between his original homophobia with his later, more moderate behaviour, but I do think it is a shame that this aspect of the story is patently untrue. It seems to have been a cynical ploy to get more bums on seats. This is my only criticism, as the film romps along at a good pace and holds your interest throughout, so if you think this is the kind of dramatic movie that might tickle your fancy, then you could do a lot worse than Dallas Buyers Club.<br/><br/>It is well directed, beautifully acted, (not only by McConaughey, but also by the rest of the much-talented cast), and although you suspect the final outcome, it doesn't detract from a genuine desire to know how it all goes down. You will empathise with the victims of this dread disease and most viewers will feel uplifted by the film's portrayal of the indomitable human spirit.<br/><br/>Go for it!"

","I was planning to watch this movie for a long time 'cause as you know it had won 3 Oscars and also nominated for other categories in 2014 AW.So, i finally watched it yesterday and without a doubt,it was outstanding. When the movie started I was blown i saw Matthew McConaughey this much skinny,it reminded me of Christian Bale from The machinist.The lead character Ron Woodroof represents a local hotshot who lives careless bachelor life and doesn't give a damn what other people think about him.When he diagnosed with AIDS,everyone thought he might've engaged in homosexual activity and they all started to keep their distance from him which actually happens in our real life.You know when i first heard about AIDS,all i heard was it occurs because of unprotected sexual activity and other stuff.Very few people accounted the other facts like sharing the same injection syringe with other people.In this movie we actually see how society reacts to this kind of problems and only look for the worst fact.This film also portrayed our hatred toward homosexuals in the 80s.Jared Leto played Rayon's role incredibly,i don't think anyone could've done it better.I'm eagerly waiting to watch him in suicide squad.Ron is a self motivated and optimistic man.When he found out that he has AIDS,he researched and began to try every possible med or treatment he could find.Thus,He went to Mexico and when he started feel better and saw that people like him are dying because of wrong treatments,he decided to stand against the FDA.We see that how pharmaceutical companies bribe Drug Administration to push their drugs despite its lots of dangerous side effects.its pity that this kind of corruption actually happens around us and we are the victims of it.Eve(Jennifer Garner) represents those doctors who value the patients life more than anything and protest against pharmaceutical company's conspiracy.It was very clever of Ron that when he came to know that he cant sell those approved drugs,he established ""Dallas Buyers Club"" with the help of Roney.Later he became less concern about money and tried to provide treatment with his money.In the end he fought for legal right to take protein but the judge couldn't do anything but admonished the FDA for their corruption. Ron Woodroof fought very much for himself and all the AIDS patients.what can u say he got his reward for his courage and all these struggles by living 7 year more than his doctor's predicted."
"bryank-04844","8","2","2","22 August 2015"," 'Dallas Buyers Club' is more than just a depressing story. It offers hope and redemption in some dramatic and even comedic ways throughout. This movie is a must see.
","'Dallas Buyers Club' is a fresh take on the familiar AIDS story. The film has a knockout script and amazing performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. The true-life narrative about a heterosexual Dallas man diagnosed with HIV in the '80s is not as down-trodden as it might seem at first glance. This little indie movie deserves attention for more than just McConaughey's name and the drastic weight loss he underwent for the role.<br/><br/>McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof, who starts the story as extremely unlikable. We meet him during a drug binge while in the middle of a three-way with some trashy girls. By day, he's an electrician for the city of Dallas, and by night, he's an urban cowboy not above yelling racial or sexist slurs at anyone. McConaughey pulls this off nicely, as if he wants you to hate him. But when a minor accident sends Woodroof to the hospital, his blood test results reveal that he's positive for HIV and that his T-cell count is dangerously low. True to character, he yells at his doctors (Denis O'Hare and Jennifer Garner) for implying that he's homosexual and getting the diagnosis wrong. Clearly, he's in denial.<br/><br/>After some research at the local library, Woodroof comes to terms with his illness, even though the doctors say that he has about 30 days to live. He tries to get on a drug trial with the new experimental medication called AZT. When he's turned down, he makes a shady deal with one of the hospital's lower-end nurses to sneak him some of the medication. Upon taking it, his condition worsens. After more research, he finds out that AZT is more harmful than good, and researches natural vitamins and proteins that can help keep the virus at bay.<br/><br/>Woodruff travels the world in search for these drugs. In his own uncharming way, he decides that he can make some money selling them to others with HIV. In an effort to keep authorities away from this business, he opens a ""Buyers Club,"" which means that he sells a monthly membership to people, and in return they receive a monthly drug dose for their illness. Since Woodroof is known as a homophobe and is disliked in the gay community, he forges a partnership with Rayon (Jared Leto), a transvestite who also has AIDS, but is a key to moving the vitamins around town.<br/><br/>One of director Jean-Marc Vallée's goals here was to show how the FDA and other government officials were not in the game of making sick people feel better, but rather to line their own greedy pockets with money from a drug that was clearly not working. Another aspect that Vallée focuses on is Woodroof's transformation from an asshole to a decent guy who ends up helping others. McConaughey achieves this perfectly. When he gets a dose of his own medicine from a former friend who puts him down for being gay, Woodroof's face displays the horror of what he's done to others. This role will probably get McConaughey an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Garner has less to work with her and her character is a little one-note, but she turns in a solid performance. Leto, on the other hand, fully dives into his character. We feel all the emotions that surround him, even his flaws and his downward spiral.<br/><br/>'Dallas Buyers Club' is more than just a depressing story. It offers hope and redemption in some dramatic and even comedic ways throughout. This little indie movie is a must see."

Otherwise i found the rest of the film intriguing and educational. especially in regards to history, aids, HIV, medical procedures and medical proceedings. The acting was all round very good.

","Much of the credit for giving this factual based film 9 out of 10 is due to the amazing acting from the leading role man Matthew McConaughey, portraying the aids infected alcohol and sex addict Ron Woodroof in a most convincing way. This part is just perfect for him and one simply forgets that it actually is acting, something that I think rarely happens any more. But perhaps more convincing is the achievement from supporting actor Jared Leto as the transsexual prostitute Rayon. Such a fantastic role performance has to have been awarded somehow. Brilliant, and did he really get that skinny for the part? The rest of the cast all do their jobs very well, but the two mentioned are simply outstanding and take modern method acting to a new level. For once the people in the makeup department really should be honored. The rest of this review is easy. To make such a good film, all people in the cast and crew have done a brilliant job and I always have a big liking for letting the small parts and extras show in the picture.

","Inspired by actual events, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" focuses on the dying years of a Dallas hustler who goes out of his way to face up against the FDA to help AIDS patients get the treatments they need to reduce the suffering after discovering that he himself has this unfortunate disease.<br/><br/>Ron Woodroof (1950-1992)(Matthew McConaughey) is a part-time electrician and a part-time rodeo entertainer who lives in Dallas, Texas. One day he gets admitted to the hospital on account of a work incident, Mr. Woodroof's hospital admittance becomes more serious than he has expected. The doctors discover that Woodroof has AIDS. Though he's not an excessive needle pusher or a homosexual, he refuses to believe that he has what he believes to be a ""gay disease"". But the tests he receives confirm that he has AIDS and according to his doctor Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) that he has only one month to live.<br/><br/>With life hanging on by a string, Woodroof confiscates the experimental drug AZT as a way to stall the illness from getting worse. And when he finally runs out, he ventures off to Mexico in search for other antidotes. What shocks him is that AZT is a poisonous substance and that if AIDS won't kill him, AZT will, but he finds a concoction that will do the trick. A victim of his own selfish purposes to make a profit, but with the assistance of a transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto, his clientele begins to expand. The larger his client based, the more homophobic and narrow-minded he becomes.<br/><br/>If he thought he could keep this operation running any longer, well reality starts to come into play. It isn't before very long that the FDA would storm on and repossess his antidotes and warns him that he will be arrested on account of trafficking. Therefore, with that in mind Woodroof establishes a subscription-only-conglomerate known in which he calls ""The Dallas Buyers Club"" where he's not officially selling drugs, but memberships. Woodroof embodies the AIDS community that these remedies actually works. And even though he's a gay-bashing jerk of an individual, but his cause is actually helping those he truly despises. Meanwhile the FDA whose payroll comes from the major pharmaceuticals, these corporate shrills are unintentionally killing them. Rod decides his destiny is to bring down the FDA and ensure that he's doing it for the sake of a cause.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey has really outdid himself here, by sacrificing his own physicality to lose a substantial amount of weight to turn away from his usual boy-toy personae making him almost unrecognizable. On a mental note, famous for his lovable romantic characters to play a rather crude, narrow-minded homophobic despot. But still, in spite of his flaws, we still love the man for what he's doing and we love McConaughey because he makes this character believable and truly deserves the accolades that was given to him.<br/><br/>Jared Leto also looks unrecognizable under all that makeup and dresses to play Woodroof's assistant Rayon. Leto avoids the silly humour like a he's going to a costume party to play a very sympathetic and endearing character. Jennifer Garner has the more complex initiative as the morally inclined Dr. Eve Saks, but she still manages to pull it off flawlessly. The supporting players are equally poignant with Denis O'Hare as the corporate siding physician Dr. Sevard and Steve Zahn as Woodroof's cop buddy, Tucker.<br/><br/>The wonderful script by Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack is saturated in character development. And even though the characters have their share of strengths and flaws, it scores high points in effectiveness and believability. The ingredient that makes this film very effective comes in terms of the relationships within the characters and that we were able to understand a complex character who's quite unlikable but still manages to hold a place in our hearts. Borten and Wallack succeed in avoiding overly done sentimentality and succeeds in keeping it standard which might seem dull to some viewers.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Marc Vallee give this cinematic project a documentary feeling to it. It's never flashy and the story is executed as all the events are transpiring before our very eyes. We see no sympathy within the characters as no one's sugarcoated and that harder truths come uncompromising. It's not pretty, but straight to the point and leaves no stone unturned. It's not always pleasant, but life was never meant to be fair. And even though the production value lacks in connection, the style of storytelling makes this movie significant.<br/><br/>When coming to see this movie, brace yourselves for two hours of engaging characters, who lack moral vibes while defending themselves against corporate shrills for the sake of a good cause. The movie depends on a motivating script intense performances and the realism involved. It won't change your life, but it will make you ponder who our government really cares for."

","A brawling cowboy, Ron (McConaughey), is given 30 days to live. Ron considers himself invincible and embarks on a journey to survive, showing us what life is like in the face of death.<br/><br/>Ron gets fired, is ostracized from friends and eventually locked out of his trailer. He is alone. When introduced to an experimental drug, AZT, Ron risks life and limb to get his hands on it and eventually begins to sell it to fellow AIDs patients. His business begins to thrive as he befriends Dr. Saks (Garner) and a transvestite (Leto) who pry at his character and mold him into a completely new man. It is very enjoyable to watch the change. <br/><br/>What is so captivating about McConaughey's portrayal is that we get to see him not as the charmer we all know and love but as a cocky, gritty, weak, vulnerable, and transformed person. This is undoubtedly an Academy Award winning to any who watch.<br/><br/>You need to see Ron at his weakest, fighting to stay alive while breaking down the remnants of a cocky cowboy. He becomes a rather sharp business man, yet finds himself passing out from time to time. It's a A+ showing from McConaughey and a performance with the likes of A Time to Kill & Lincoln Lawyer.<br/><br/>The movie itself is an interesting ride through the 1980s AIDs crisis, riddled with facts and legal caveats which Ron and his sidekicks exploit. You will see how under-funded research really was at the time and notice the awful stigma attached to AIDs patients.<br/><br/>A shallow viewer may pass over this movie, hating it for being a story about a ""recognizable sort of redeemed bad boy"" (JESSE CATALDO- SLANT MAGAZINE). Some may find the filthy nature of Ron and the focus on transvestite and homosexual culture repulsive but these people are missing a gem of a movie. Some viewers went as far as to say this movie was cliché'd and portrayed health care pros in a bad light to which I would say-- It's only a movie. The grittiness of the film was not well received by all either as there are many nude sex scenes and drug use. It is a rather mature film.<br/><br/>The movie is steeped in darkness, balanced with heart and laced with a silver lining of cool that only McConaughy can bring. Highly Recommended!

","In 1985 Dallas, electrician and hustler Ron Woodroof works around the system to help AIDS patients get the medication they need after he is himself diagnosed with the disease. ""Screw the FDA, I'm a DOA!"" With a deadly virus in his body and red tape around his throat, Ron Woodroof is fighting back. An imperfect man fights for survival during an uncertain time in America. Inspired by true events, Ron Woodroof's story of strength is told in Dallas Buyers Club. Matthew McConaughey portrays the real-life character. He lost 18 kg for his role of a man dying of AIDS. That's not just a number. The ashen complexion, the red, sunken eyes, the gaunt face and the skeletal body — laid bare to unsparing light — tell the story of a disease that ravaged not just the body but, in the 1980s, left a scared, uncomprehending world looking at something they barely understood. After his friends shun him owing to the 'disease' and the doctors give him 30 days to put his affairs in order, instead of succumbing to depression, he becomes his own physician. He discovers and smuggles unapproved but effective drugs into the US from Mexico and other countries for himself and to make money. What seems like a standard plot is elevated to excellence by the lead actors' remarkable performances. There's more to McConaughey than the drastic weight loss. From getting the Texan mannerisms, swagger and his character's juvenility right, to producing a range of emotions, he reinvents himself and gives the performance of his career. It would be a shame if he doesn't bag the much-coveted Oscar for it. Leto is a revelation too and deserves the accolades coming his way.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club may not be the authoritative story on the AIDS scare of the 1980s, but it's as good as any.<br/><br/>Ron died in 1992, seven years after he was diagnosed with HIV. This is his incredible life story, told with a dash of humour and an empathy-evoking narrative. Brilliant would be an understatement."

","1985; Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is an electrician and small time hustler from Dallas. His life basically consists of care free sex, rodeo, and hustling. However, Woodroof's life ends up being turned upside down when he is diagnosed as being HIV positive. Following his diagnosis, he is given a drug known as AZT which is a drug that is being trialled at the local hospital. However, when Woodroof discovers that this new drug does more harm than good, he decides to set up the Dallas Buyers Club with fellow patient and AZT Guinea Pig Rayon (Leto). Woodroof and Rayon offer patients an alternative to the harmful AZT drug that is offered at the local hospital - they offer patients unlimited medicine and treatment in exchange for payment of $400 per month which buys the patients membership into the buyers club. Woodroof's activities end up getting him in hot water with the FDA (Food & Drug Administration)due to the fact that Woodroof is selling unlicenced medication to patients. However, Woodroof is undeterred and is prepared to take on the FDA whatever the cost.<br/><br/>This film was excellent; from the moment it's revealed that Woodroof is diagnosed as being HIV positive, he really does get into his character. Woodroof's emotions range from denial, anger, and then acceptance. Once he's at the acceptance stage this is when he decides to set up the Dallas Buyers Club. The build up through all of these stages is gradual and McConaughey once again shows his talent. I really hope he keeps doing these serious dramas as he is far better in these type of roles than he is in some of those crappy rom-coms that he's done in the past. McConaughey's superb acting is coupled with some terrific writing - even though Woodroof is rather objectionable at the start, he actually shows some really good qualities. Although he is profiting from other sufferers what he's doing still has a certain dignity about it as he is affected by the same illness - the very fact that he's helping people and giving them a second choice was so touching. I think what made it even better was his tenacity, no matter what the FDA threw at him he would always try and find another way to overthrow them - he never gave up on his cause and I really respect anyone that shows such determination.<br/><br/>The second thing that was great about this film was Jared Leto - it's no wonder that both McConaughey and Leto won best actor and best supporting actor respectively. I think they both thoroughly deserved these awards. When they were both on screen together they were excellent, but they were both strong on their own as well. Their on screen chemistry is amongst the best I've ever seen and they had me laughing several times. Leto must have had a right laugh playing the role of Rayon - even though it's a serious film, Leto really 'camps it up' in his role as the transvestite Aids sufferer and if anything he probably over does it a bit. Having said that, given his character and material it clearly works better by him over doing it than under doing it so it's not meant as a criticism. I wouldn't be surprised if a few people didn't recognise him as he looks so different to how we're used to seeing him. Like McConaughey, Leto also lost an awful lot of weight in his role and again like McConaughey his acting was superb.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I'll say in my reviews that 'this film is not for everyone' but I honestly think that this is a film that everyone should see. It is somewhat downbeat at times, but then again there are many humorous moments as well (particularly between McConaughey and Leto). This film will particularly appeal to fans of biographical films or films about one person trying to overthrow a large corporation/company. There's not really much more I can say - just make sure you watch Dallas Buyers Club. You won't be disappointed."

","The character Matthew McConaughey portrays is not a saint. He did some very good things, that helped a lot of people, but his intention was not to be heroic from the get go. And the film does portray him as a man with faults and flaws all the same. It's that fact that really elevates the movie above other rose tinted movies that show everything to be smooth, soft and nicely done.<br/><br/>This one gets down and dirty (sometimes literally) and will not be everyones taste. Even though or because the Academy Awards did think this was worthy of some statues. You may argue that there must have been a better performance in 2013 than that of Jared Leto. But you can't criticize him or think less of the movie, if some other people made that decision. Plus he is good in this movie, whether you like the character he plays or not.<br/><br/>Not an easy movie to watch, this will keep you on your toes if you allow it to."

","Dallas Buyers Club is an incredibly realistic, raw and gritty movie. It tells the story of Ron Woodroof, a man diagnosed with HIV who goes to incredible lengths to keep on living. The acting in the movie is amazing, Matthew McConaughey is perfect as the main character. He is amazingly diverse in the role, in some scenes, he portrays Ron as being a really tough guy, but he is able to change to an emotional scene in a heartbeat. Jared Leto blew me away as Rayon, a cross-dressing man with AIDS. At first he looks all happy and care-free, but as the story progresses we see just how affected he is by his disease. The rest of the cast are very good as well, all the doctors and government officials and Ron's friends. I just thought Jennifer Garner wasn't the best in her role, she was kind of so-so in the dramatic moments her character got, and her interactions with Ron felt a bit unnatural, she was good, but she just wasn't on par with the leading men. But it's McConaughey and Leto that deserve all the praise, which thankfully they got.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the real life story of Ron Woodroof. It's very interesting, there are no dull moments at all in the movie, it is an incredible drama, but there some comedic elements as well, specially during Ron's interactions with Rayon. The screenplay was amazing, the dialogue is incredibly interesting, it makes you care a lot about the characters. It has a lot to say on the FDA about how they take some time to approve or reject drugs, and how they don't allow certain drugs that actually work to be administrated in hospitals. <br/><br/>I thought the technical aspects of the movie, directing, editing, cinematography. Especially the editing, Jean Marc-Valleé and Martin Pensa did a great job, I really enjoyed the scenes where Ron is travelling and looking for drugs. <br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club certainly deserved all of its Oscar nominations and wins, it has powerful performances and an emotional story, one of 2013's best movies.

","'Dallas Buyers Club' is directed by Jean-Marc Valleè and stars Matthew McConaughey (in what might be the single best performance I have ever seen in a film), Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner. <br/><br/>I have to say, this film is just fantastic. The story, about a man named Ron (McConaughey), who is diagnosed with AIDS and his fight against the law to find and distribute a better treatment for the disease, is driven by some of the best acting I have ever seen by McConaughey. Jared Leto also gives an outstanding performance as Rayon, a trans-gendered man who also contracts AIDS. It may not be the most historically accurate piece of cinema I've ever seen, but the characters in this film help to completely immerse you, at points you actually feel as if you're there alongside Ron throughout his fight for survival. <br/><br/>Then, of course, there's Jennifer Garner, but I've learned to accept that she'll never improve as an actress. Garner's performance was... acceptable as best. (Better luck next time, Jen.)<br/><br/>If I have one complaint about this film, it's that the pacing is a bit off. For example, at one point the film jumps from Day 8 of Ron's battle with AIDS to Day 28. Though this was done by means of a montage, it was a bit confusing to see so little happen on the screen and be told I'd just watched 20 days of events in a 90 second montage.<br/><br/>Aside from that, everything else is executed so very well. The brilliant acting, well told story, setting and character development all come together to create a truly great film that will surely go down in cinematic history. I give 'Dallas Buyers Club' a 9.5 out of 10."

","'Dallas Buyers Club' could have gone all kinds of wrong. It's the sort of story that just seems to invite heavy-handed storytelling and over the top acting. Thanks to a thoughtful approach by director Jean-Marc Vallée and career defining performances by stars Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, it transcends bio-pic clichés and ""disease of the week"" melodrama to deliver a story that is ultimately about the strength of the human spirit and the importance of taking matters into your own hands.<br/><br/>'Dallas Buyers Club' is not a great film, but it is a very good one, and one worth watching for reasons beyond mere entertainment value.

","Dallas buyers club is a hell of movie. It is powerful, moving, touching, delicate and harsh at the same time. It has a European fell to it, and it is Oscar worthy. But, it is boring.<br/><br/>1) The acting. I write this review after the Oscars have been given and I believe that the Academy has done a great job this time. Matthew McConaughey is absolutely brilliant. He has shown that his acting capabilities are sky-high. His (disturbing) physical transformation, his strong southern accent, his charisma, his performance of a man broken transformed into a man so strong is magnificent. Not giving him an Oscar would be a crime. But, the one that truly rocked the cradle was Leto. I do not remember one person in my movie watching career that gave such a performance. He literally swept McConaughey in every scene they shared (take into consideration that McConaughey's role is the best one this year). One scene in particular points out his supremacy - the father-son talk where the suit Leto wears fits him like he was a woman! That kind of acting is a role model even for Daniel Day Lews. Garner was cute, nothing more. Cute is the word that describes her entire role and acting (but one can forgive her, she had Leto and McConaughey to deal with).<br/><br/>2) The story. This is where the movie fails. The story had everything it needed to become a historical movie: political correctness, the problem of AIDS awareness, the ""evil"" FDA, the small man's fight against the government etc. etc. It utilized non of these. The story focused entirely on the acting and the characters and halfway through the movie, I became bored. When I become bored during a movie, there is something very wrong with it. I can understand that this type of a movie is supposed to be like this but I can remember movies like The Insider that really worked up the story and held you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>3) The music. Terrible. Just terrible. There is almost no music, and where there is some, it is just not fitting.<br/><br/>4) The directing. Masterfull. Vallee gave it a slow paced (a bit too slow paced) note, he new exactly when and where to do what. Every scene fits perfectly into the big picture. This is textbook directing. But, a bit more risk would not have hurt.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one movie you should watch. It is powerful and moving, with brilliant performances but without a strong storyline. I simply cannot shake the feeling that more could have been done."

","A free wheeling chauvinistic ,homophobic, cocky and offensive rodeo - Ron Woodroof takes a daily dose of drugs, alcohol & women with working as an electrician somewhere in between these hobbies. When confronted with death itself coming in the form of the 'gay virus' :HIV ,he responds aggressively and ignorantly lives in denial continuing his toxic lifestyle. The truth slowly dawns upon him as every moment slips away painfully . In his pulse-less search for the cure to his virus, he realizes the dirty business that hospitals are .He decides to walk away from the corrupt hospitals which give approved but toxic drugs and starts a clean business but with unapproved drugs. Thus, giving birth to a Dallas Buyers Club. Dallas Buyers Club is a touching ad important story in which two characters exceptionally stand out due to brilliance in acting ,Ron Woodroof played by Matthew McConaughey and Rayon played by Jared Leto. <br/><br/>Matthew does his role flawlessly and admirably well. From conveying emotions of shock on learning of his medical condition to that of suffering from a heart attack, the Oscar awardee makes no mistake in any frame of the film.Yes ,Just read that aloud again . He faked a HEART ATTACK. (Awestruck)He keeps the masculine spirit of woodroof intact throughout as he offers his prayers to god in a strip club. The intricate variations in the character can be observed on screen as he transforms from being a homophobic and rugged cowboy to a responsible human being. Taking on the role of a diseased person with abnormal habits was a mammoth task . Matthew takes this up boldly by flaunting a skeletal look in the film which is not a very pretty sight. The sound of fading pulses and his appearance make it hard for viewers to even breathe. From being the romantic hero in romcoms like how to lose a guy in 10 days to this important film , Matthew takes a huge leap. His subtle display of the character of a simple man who takes appreciation modestly is showcased as he smiles like a bunny in the climax feeling happy to be recognized for his efforts. That smile right there in the end is priceless.<br/><br/>Quote:""Screw the FDA ,I'm gonna be DOA.""<br/><br/>Jared Leto's performance comes as a huge surprise as he plays Rayon the good natured homosexual. Rayon is the only character which keeps you entertained with humor and portrayal of the feelings of a homosexual. Jared does complete justice to the character by playing it fearlessly on screen. The pain of not being accepted, feeling like a misfit shown by Jared will leave you in tears. Those feminine antics and unconditional love that rayon shows absolutely stand out in the film.Scenes with Rayon's father are acted commendably well as they allow you to imagine the love-hate relationship they must have shared. By the end of the movie, Jared succeeds in leaving a void and making you feel incomplete and sympathetic towards rayon.An Oscar well deserved .<br/><br/>Quote: ""i wanna be pretty""<br/><br/>The relationship that Ron and Rayon share is a very wry and intimate gesture of love. They have a fantastic chemistry throughout the film and make good business partners. Although the initially homophobic Ron tries to keep Rayon at a distance, the space between them narrows as the story progresses. Ron is left deeply scarred when Rayon dies which makes him a person who sincerely wants to help the infected even in a time when the business runs poor on cash. Few characters like Ron's physician, his so called friends and a bunch of angry faces have a lasting effect and do their part in the film well.All the main characters on the whole cry the universal struggle for normalcy.<br/><br/>DBC, all in all , is a fantastic film with an important and powerful script which tells the true stories of a person who refused to die,a person who stood up against the system, a person who had faced abandonment and a person diagnosed with AIDS ,genuinely and bravely. Making a movie based on a true story and a dry topic like this restricts the story in a film which is exactly what happened in this case. Bottom line: Amazing acting ,Important film.<br/><br/>""Strange. Life is strange."""

","A scathing retroactive commentary on the sins of the FDA and the failures of the US government as the AIDS epidemic was kicking into high gear. Matthew McConaughey (the latest actor to reap rewards for grotesquely altering his appearance) is barely recognizable in the leading role, a rail-thin, homophobic cowboy who contracts the disease at a point in time where it was widely believed that gays were its only victims. The dose of reality he's fed is swift, bitter and thoroughly justified, though that doesn't make it any easier to watch. His journey is an impressive one, if bittersweet, and his emergence from drunkenness and ignorance is a key point. Heartbreakingly vivid, especially in its portrayal of the contradictory lengths the government is willing to go to preserve the interests of its real masters, it deserves credit for refusing to hammer the point until we're all feeling blunt and dulled. I appreciated the ride and agreed with each core message, though naysayers could certainly accuse it of having an agenda."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","2","11 March 2014"," A complex character, a dark era and a pinnacle performance
","In a time when TV is dominated by shows about morally twisted main characters you can't help but root for, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" fits right in, plus it adds a layer of historical relevance and social responsibility those shows usually lack. <br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey, another rising trend unto himself, stars as Texan Ron Woodruff, electrician and rodeo bull-rider whose loose ways with drugs and women lead him to contract HIV. By the time he discovers he has it, it's full-blown AIDS, and the doctors give him 30 days to live. Both outraged and desperate to prolong his life, he researches the disease and discovers AZT, a drug currently in trials, is the only medication available in the United States. Unable to scrounge some up with any consistency, Woodruff heads to Mexico and smuggles in unapproved drugs, enough to sell them to others who have HIV/AIDS. He establishes a ""buyers club"" so that he isn't selling drugs to clients (illegal), but instead selling a membership to a club that gives clients access to drugs.<br/><br/>If McConaughey has reached an apex with his string of independent roles in the last few years, this film is it. In ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" he works his ""alright alright alright"" machismo into a complex character who undergoes a major transformation from the story's start to its end. Considering AIDS was largely known as a problem in the gay community at the time, Woodruff was incensed at the notion that he could have it. Eventually, however, through getting to know a number of LGBT individuals including Rayon (Jared Leto), his transgender business partner, he comes to love and defend them. McConaughey makes this real and sincere, with help from Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack's screenplay.<br/><br/>The story jumps forward often to show the highlights and lowlights of Woodruff's operation. Woodruff, it seems, is both the film's protagonist and antagonist. More often than not, his reckless handling of untested drugs is what lands him in trouble, whether in the hospital or the hands of the FDA. His cyclical behavior pattern provides the ups and downs of the plot, and allows him to build relationships with the supporting players including Leto and Jennifer Garner, who plays a doctor at Woodruff's near-most hospital.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" is McConaughey's show, but Leto in particular does a nice job winning the audience over. Rayon has some challenging, eye-opening scenes as well as some intense personal moments, and Leto becomes her with a certain subtlety. There's no question the bulk of his praise comes unwarranted from simple-minded audiences who believe it's impressive and brave for a straight man to play a transgender character, but he does a lot of things well in the role that the attention isn't completely misguided.<br/><br/>Nothing that director Jean-Marc Vallee (""The Young Victoria"") does is especially noteworthy, but ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a tight and well-told package of a film that utilizes strong storytelling technique and editing and provides some insight into a period of all-too-recent history. It runs clean start to finish without any notable blemishes, which is of course an achievement unto itself.<br/><br/>McConaughey's performance will be forever remembered as the memorable achievement of ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" but it's a pristine piece of filmmaking that does the little things right from the script to the editing to the makeup. It doesn't reach the echelon of great modern period pieces, but it deserves the label of a great film.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more"

","Dallas Buyer's Club was the first movie for which I felt compelled to write a review, such is my passionate love for it. A jarringly honest and uncensored window into the struggle against bureaucracy for a legitimate cure for AIDS, It brought my stomach to my chest in its most sorrowful of moments and made me laugh at its lightest.<br/><br/>Considering that it is not an action movie, nor set in outer space, one may puzzle as to why it was nominated for 'Best Achievement in Editing' at the academy awards this year- that is, until they have seen the film. Both the pacing and mood set by the cutting style were equally incredible. It utilised brilliantly silence, muffled ringing and dull blurs of colour to create a dead, tired trance scene at the start of the movie, so infective that I felt almost sleepy. Using similarly formulated scenes to break up the movie gave the audience an awareness of time and effectively drove home the transformation that Ron underwent by allowing a viewer to subconsciously compare and weigh each 'section' of the movie. The thought put into the film's direction, particularly structure, is incredible. <br/><br/>Both Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey achieved perfection in their roles, playing parts from malnourished drug-addicts to suave and charismatic businessmen.<br/><br/>These, among other masteries and small perfections were what made Dallas Buyer's Club such a joy to watch."

","In Dallas Buyers Club, Mathew McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof, a Texan who in 1985 tested positive for HIV. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, Dallas Buyers Club is undoubtedly one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>Ron Woodroof is an electrician, as well as a rodeo cowboy. One day he wakes up in a hospital bed and the doctors tell him that he is diagnosed with AIDS, and has 30 days left. He finds out about a drug called AZT which is still in the testing phase, but thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. He ends up taking some AZT in unmonitored doses. But when his condition worsens, he goes to a Doctor in New Mexico who gives him some unapproved medicine that's actually better. Woodroof then takes it upon himself to smuggle the medicine into Dallas.<br/><br/>Seeing how Woodroof lived his life, Whether it's doing drugs or having sex in the place where they keep the bulls (I've later found out it's called a bucking chute), you can see why he got AIDS. Back then people thought of AIDS as the ""Gay Disease"" so it's no wonder all his friends assume Woodroof is a homosexual thus turning their backs on him. Friends like these, huh? Later on, Woodroof meets Rayon, a trans-woman who is also HIV positive, and of course Woodroof is disgusted by her at first. But after some time spent with each other, they end up opening the Dallas Buyers Club where you don't buy the drugs, you buy a membership and get the drugs for free.<br/><br/>First off, you can't talk about the movie without marveling at how good the acting is. Mathew McConaughey, who for the longest time was just another pretty boy whose filmography consisted of the same generic romantic comedies, really stepped up his game in 2013 with the release of Mud and Dallas Buyers Club. I honestly never knew he was such a good actor and he rapidly became one of the actors that I look forward to the most. The movie also marks the return of Jared Leto to the big screen after a five year absence. Leto plays the role of Rayon, a transgender who is also diagnosed with AIDS. Now Leto has been in good movies before and has delivered some fine performances, but I think it's safe to say that this is definitely his best yet. Jennifer Garner is also in the movie playing the role of Dr. Eve Saks.<br/><br/>Both McConaughey and Leto lost a lot of weight for their roles. We've seen this before from Actors and Actresses like Christian Bale in The Machinist, Michael Fassbender in Hunger, and Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby. Jared Leto also went through a body transformation for a role before when he gained 67 pounds for the movie Chapter 27. Where he played Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's killer.<br/><br/>All the good acting wouldn't have meant anything if the director doesn't know what he's doing. Thankfully Jean-Marc Vallée does know what he's doing, and he's done a very good job. The movie has this raw, gritty and dirty vibe to it that really works to its advantage.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyer Club is a powerful movie that sticks with you. Ron Woodroof was a man who got handed the short stick in life and decided to try and fight it, or die trying with his boots on. Great movie that everyone should see."

The best part about Dallas Buyers Club is that it can switch between comedic & emotional moments, effortlessly! What is even better than the film are its performances. Matthew McConaughey has given the performance of a lifetime as Ron Woodroof. He truly deserves the Oscar for Best Actor(even though I was rooting for Leonardo DiCaprio). McConaughey completely transforms himself by shedding lots of weight, in order to accurately portray an AIDS patient. Jennifer Garner is impressive as Eve. However, the standout performer is Jared Leto as Rayon. Leto who also deserves his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, effortlessly transforms himself into a trans-gender & is totally believable as the adorable Rayon. Dennis O'Hare is great as Dr. Sevard. Steve Zahn is brilliant as Woodroof's cop buddy, Tucker. Michael O'Neill is menacingly spectacular as FDA agent, Richard Barkley. The supporting characters are effective as well. The bottom line is, Dallas Buyers Club is a must watch. Do not miss it!"

","'Dallas Buyers Club' tells the true story of Ron Woodroof and his efforts to get alternative medication to AIDS patients in America. He's an interesting character. His motives are never straightforward. Sometimes he seems like nothing more than an extortionist, and yet at other times he shows he has a heart. We are taken on the fascinating story of this man, performed brilliantly by Matthew McConaughey.<br/><br/>McConaughey seems to cop a bit of a rough time in social media and television shows like 'Family Guy'. But he really seems to have hit his stride in the last two years. Every performance he turns out is memorable. He appears in two of the Best Picture nominees at the Oscars for 2013 (this and 'The Wolf of Wall Street') and is quite likely to take home Best Actor for 'Dallas Buyers Club' (ironically the only person challenging him for that award is Leo Dicaprio in 'The Wolf of Wall Street'). And deservedly so. It wasn't just his body transformation that was amazing (he lost 21kg) but his acting as well. A powerful performance.<br/><br/>Jared Leto was the other stand out. I knew nothing about his role coming into the film, so I was quite taken aback when we were introduced to him. He also lost a lot of weight for his role. But more than that he was a scene stealer and nailed the character perfectly. The disappointment for me was Jennifer Garner. She had very little screen presence and turned in a pretty forgettable performance.<br/><br/>'Dallas Buyers Club' doesn't tug at your emotional strings as much as I feel it could've and for that I applaud it. It isn't simply trying to make you fall in love with a character only then to take them away. It takes the high road and focuses on the story and what this passionate man did in an undesirable situation. A great watch."

","A powerful movie of 1 flawed man's battle to live, not just on his own terms, but also using any means available, and those not made available by the bodies that govern people in the US. This is a very important, timely and topical movie, and I don't know if the audiences watching this are focusing on that aspect at all, or will the issue be swept under by the onslaught of superlative performances like how it happened with 'Erin Brockovich'? Unfortunately, I got to watch the chopped version, though it also did not deter much from the power inherent in key sequences.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is a shoo-in for a win, IMO, as is McConaughey, though the transformation could have been depicted better (however, its not as in-your-face as Bale's was in 'American Hustle' causing audiences to focus on that instead of on the character himself).<br/><br/>Garner finally has something to do with, and she chews on it as she can. Gone are those expressions sans confidence - this is a welcome return-to-form (though my friends says the same of her leading 'Butter' as well, but I'm yet to watch that, so this will remain my frame of reference).<br/><br/>From a man who's given a finite time to live, who goes into denial, but then comes through to grapple with the reality that he's been given, and rise above that, while also trying to use unorthodox means to do that, is no mean feat. I am now primed to read up the real story of Ronal Woodroof, and see if it affected anything at all. This makes a close companion-piece to 'Fire in the blood', and if someone watches this, they will be able to immediately understand why I made this correlation.<br/><br/>Not to be missed, esp. on the big screen, preferably uncut."
"seaview1","9","2","2","1 March 2014"," The Art of Survival in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB
","The fact it supposedly took nearly twenty years to bring the true story of Ron Woodroof to the screen is a somber fact which has not muted its impact over time. This heart wrenching chronicle of one man's desperate attempts against all odds features marvelous performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.<br/><br/>It is 1985 in Dallas, Texas, and rodeo rider, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), has an accident and ends up in the hospital where he learns he has the HIV virus which causes AIDs, a death sentence which, according to his doctor, gives him thirty days to live and put his affairs in order. Stunned by the news, which heretofore was a sexually transmitted disease among homosexuals, Ron learns the grim truth about AIDs, a growing global epidemic. What's worse is the lack of any effective treatment even as trials for the experimental drug AZT begin via the Food and Drug Administration. Frustrated by ineffective drugs and running out of time, Ron takes matters in his own hands and begins to research the disease and travels to Mexico and other exotic locations for possible answers. He tries drug and vitamin combinations, a kind of AIDs cocktail, and begins to sell these to others. He even finds a way to circumvent the law forbidding his selling drugs by offering memberships. Helped by a fellow AIDs patient, Rayon (Jared Leto), his 'clinic' sees an explosion in membership as his cocktail gains in popularity. As the FDA and the IRS attempt to shut down his operation, he wages a one man fight against the forces that would close his enterprise and a hope for AIDs patients.<br/><br/>It is interesting that the world has come a long way in the treatment and survivability of AIDs, but back then there were severely limited resources. Also the stigma and intolerance of being gay was more pronounced. Ron's homophobic reactions evolve over time in a very convincing, realistic way, and he is affected and transformed to the point where he even takes on Rayon as an unlikely business partner and even friend. That relationship, that unlikely pairing, is what makes the story fascinating and at times poignant.<br/><br/>That it took a deadly malady to give his a life purpose and definition is the supreme irony. By no means a saint, he has casual sex partners when he isn't snorting cocaine or boozing it up, and when he isn't scamming a buck, utters a plethora of profanities when it suits him. He is a survivor and hustler who proves his resourcefulness in obtaining his drugs and vitamins even resorting to disguises, schmoozing, and legal maneuvering.<br/><br/>McConaughey (Contact, The Lincoln Lawyer) lost as much as 47 pounds for this role to depict the AIDs ravaged survivor; it's the role of a lifetime. Leto (Requiem for a Dream) equally excels as the transvestite and drug addict who befriends Ron and provides a window into the world of gays and more potential clients. Jennifer Garner registers a strong performance as a sympathetic doctor caught between treatment controversies.<br/><br/>You almost wish that the filmmakers (director Jean-Marc Vallée and screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) had expanded upon the machinations of the FDA and pharmaceutical drug companies which held sway over life and death particularly in a standout scene near the end as Ron confronts the FDA in front of an audience. But this is primarily an intimate portrayal of a rebel, one whose self discovery leads to remarkable action and a profound effect on many others.<br/><br/>You do wish some of the plot lines had been more developed. For instance, Ron's police friend, Tucker, has a scene with his elderly father involving a drug; it would have been nice to develop that subplot which figures later when Ron needs help in a sticky situation.<br/><br/>The film is a low budget production, but that enhances its realism. A bittersweet story full of the charm and vigor that McConaughey brings to Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club lingers long after its closing credits as a testament of an imperfect person in an impossible situation who left a memorable mark."

"Turfseer","9","2","2","26 February 2014"," McConaughey is superb as redneck homophobe transformed into compassionate, alternative health activist
","'The Dallas Buyers Club' is the first mainstream film that has the guts to question both the efficacy and legitimacy of Orthodox Medicine's early AIDS medication research as well as highlighting the unhealthy relationship between the researchers, doctors and pharmaceutical companies, who pushed toxic treatments on an unsuspecting public. The man who led the valiant crusade against this nasty coterie of entrenched interests was the unlikely Texas electrician and part-time rodeo cowboy, Ron Woodroof (played brilliantly by Matthew McConaghey), who went from being a redneck homophobe to a tolerant, alternative health activist.<br/><br/>When we're first introduced to Woodroof, he's the epitome of what some may call 'Trailer Trash'. Woodroof pals around with his homophobic buddies, has sex with prostitutes and uses drugs like candy. After sustaining a work-related injury (he's zapped by a faulty electrical current), Woodroof's brought to the hospital to recover. The tests reveal that he's got AIDS and he's told he has 30 days to live. First Woodroof's in denial but remembers that he had unprotected sex with an intravenous drug user. As he researches causes of AIDS in the library, it dawns on him that his drug use in general probably was also a big factor leading to his illness. As we break into Act II, Woodruff's life is upended as he's ostracized by his community and must fend for himself as he seeks a cure.<br/><br/>When AZT first came out, the double blind experiments prevented subjects from knowing whether they were getting the real thing or a placebo. Woodroof is forced to bribe a hospital worker to obtain the drug but after using it for a short time, finds his health getting worse. When his supply at the hospital runs out, it's then that he hears about a doctor in Mexico, Vass, who might have some AZT. It turns out that Dr. Vass was barred from practicing in the US after giving his patients non- approved, alternative medications. It's this Dr. Vass who enlightens Woodroof about the dangers of AZT and how it's completely toxic. He gives him the protein, peptide T, along with some other non-toxic medication and Woodroof finds himself getting better. I'm not sure if the medication did the trick or it simply was the lack of flooding his body with toxic stuff like AZT that stabilized the very ill Woodroof, but whatever the case, this Dr. Vass was on to something.<br/><br/>After his health begins to improve, Woodroof gets the idea that he can make money by importing the alternative AIDS medications and selling them by subscription (Dallas Buyers Club members must pay $400 per month to get the medications); he smuggles them into the US dressed as a priest and claiming they're for his personal use. Earlier, Woodroof met a transsexual diagnosed with AIDS by the name of Rayon (Jared Leto) who he tries to avoid due to his homophobia. But after his own bout with the illness, Woodroof becomes more accepting of Rayon, who becomes his business partner, bringing in new clients from her contacts in the gay community. <br/><br/>'Dallas Buyers Club' is perhaps the first mainstream film that criticizes both allopathic medicine and big Pharma. When Dr. Sevard finds out about the buyer's club, he castigates Woodroof because his efforts are interfering with his AZT trials. It's obvious that in the doctor's view of things, only orthodox medicine has the right to grant access to treatment for AIDS sufferers. Worse is the attitude of the FDA in the form of point man Richard Barkley, who ends up confiscating Woodroof's medications and threatens to have him jailed. Later, Woodroof attempts to challenge the FDA's new rules which make it illegal to dispense alternative medications for AIDS sufferers. While Woodroof loses in Federal Court (the Judge sympathizes but argues that legally, his hands are tied), he emerges as a hero to the gay community along with progressive sympathizers.<br/><br/>Not everyone in the medical community views Woodroof as a demon. Gradually, Dr. Eve Saks comes around to his point of view. She's right however, when Woodroof gets angry over the fact that Rayon was taken to the hospital and given AZT while he was away. Dr. Saks tells Woodroof that ultimately Rayon died from her own drug usage and not from one or two days of AZT treatment. The idea that Woodroof would lash out like that is understandable given the fact that he had just learned of Rayon's death. But ultimately,Woodroof's blaming Rayon's death solely on AZT (especially for the short time she was administered the drug), was irrational.<br/><br/>If there is one sour note in the film, it's in one of the closing credits. We're informed that due to Woodroof's efforts, AZT was modified so that it was less toxic and millions of AIDS sufferers were saved. I hardly believe that Woodroof would have been happy with such a statement. The whole point of the film was that Woodruff was a crusader who fought for alternative medications and he himself lived longer, not because of toxic pharmaceutical products but because he took benign alternative ones--which perhaps gave his body a better chance than the kind of medicines touted by mainstream physicians and their government minions.<br/><br/>In the end, even Woodroof's alternative medications were not enough to prevent him from dying of AIDS. But he lived seven years longer than his initial diagnosis of 30 days. 'Dallas Buyers Club' not only bravely holds up a mirror to a medical establishment that has for too long been given a free pass in regards to increased scrutiny but it's also a perceptive tale of a man who transformed himself from a bigot and self-centered materialist to a compassionate healer with a moral and humanitarian core."

","Alright, alright, alright.... I was very impressed with the performance that Matthew McConaughey has given in this movie. His physical commitment, drama level and everything he did to create the whole character. Also Jared Leto was very good. I loved his part in this movie. Their commitment to these roles made it all very believable. For Matthew, I think it is his best part ever. Kudos to the actors, directors and everyone involved, but especially to Matthew McConaughey! I gave it 9 stars in total. 1 DVD I will add to the collection for sure! I hope this will also shed again some more positive light for the gay community. Afterall, we are all the same. I have nothing bad to say about this movie at all."

","Nominated for a well deserved 6 Academy Awards this season, including Best Picture, Best Lead and Supporting Actor, and Best Hair and Makeup(which only had a $250.00 budget), this film is truly a fearless performance given both by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.<br/><br/>The story is partly based on the true life of Ron Woodroof, a man diagnosed with HIV virus in the 80's. This was about the time Rock Hudson came clean about having the disease himself and finally revealing he was a gay man. No one in the medical field understood what the disease was or how to help patients with it, let alone have a cure for it - which in turn made normal everyday individuals panic when around someone diagnosed with HIV. Fearing that it would be caught airborne and not virally, people would disassociate themselves with individuals that had it and not take time to understand the disease or the person.<br/><br/>Ron is a hard talking, drug fueled, womanizer: an electrician by day and in his spare time a rider of bulls who cons betting men out of money. Through a series of events he winds up in the hospital and has his blood tested, finding out that he is HIV positive. Not wanting to hear the news that he has been given an ""expiration"" date of 30 days, he storms out of the hospital and proceeds to live his life the way he always has, hard and fast. Once giving the news to his friends, he soon finds himself an outcast with nowhere to turn. When he hears that there is an experimental drug called AZT holding clinical trials, he is determined to get his hands on it. Ron does not seem to be getting any better even though he is taking this drug, illegally I might add; so he makes a trip to Mexico where his life is drastically changed. Ron is taught that what you put in your body can dramatically change the course you are on.<br/><br/>Ron soon meets the ever charming Rayon ( Jared Leto) who is a man dressed in women's clothes. She stands for everything that Ron hates. Both being diagnosed with HIV, they decide to embark on a crazy idea: bring the medicine that will really work to the people that really need it - so they form a Buyers Club. For a monthly fee, patients will be given access to medicine that will help with pain and their life expectancy. However it is illegal and the FDA does not look favorably on this type of club since they are the main supporter of the drug AZT. <br/><br/>As the audience, we get to see Ron, not change who he is, but adapt to his circumstance. He grows to understand people and not be so hard and hateful. He learns that sometimes the people that we keep around are not our true friends, but the people that are around us when we are at our worst are the true friends. Jennifer Garner, Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, and Michael O'Neill round out this stunning cast.<br/><br/>The movie is quite graphic with strong language, drug use and nudity. McConaughey drastically lost 45 pounds for this role and at times appears quite emaciated. This is a movie to watch when children are not present for sure. My only complaint about the film would be that I would have liked to see the story delve a little further into the later part of Ron's life showing how he learned to cope with the disease. I highly recommend seeing this film if anything to understand that the epidemic of drug companies out to make money has existed for a long time and continues on today. All in all it's a great story and deserving of every award given this season. Shouldn't we all ""Dare to Live""?"

","Above all, this is a very moving and poignant film. It incorporates a variety of issues which work together to make it an outstanding picture, such as: prejudice, romance, friendship, compassion and struggle. The acting is superb and portrays each theme to its best. To find out that the film is based on reality made it even more moving and sparked even more admiration for the main character. From beginning to end, I was totally engaged with the story and was made to feel sympathy, admiration and even contempt for various characters which is one sign of a great film. At times, the film was quite funny which made it even more enjoyable and added to the range of emotions that you feel when watching. The ending was completely fitting of the film and was a great way to link the start to finish as well as to sum up the main character perfectly."
"CMTiago","8","2","2","19 February 2014"," The strenght of the actors
","As has been said, Dallas Buyers Club is a movie that depends on the hard hitting performances of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. I have to say I agree with this. The directing is actually one of the least redeeming parts of the film, the script grows but yet isn't anything extraordinary and this not being a technical movie there isn't much to applaud in that process of filmmaking.<br/><br/>So this movie presents the real life story of Ron Woodruff, a southern ""cowboy"" that upon learning that he has been diagnosed with HIV sets out to make a difference for those suffering from the same fate, and this after he first dismisses it. McConaughey is simply great in this challenging role. His physical transformation was a point that was very much praised, but his emotional take on the character was a big assist to the success of the performance. This is a guy who really changes for the better and the actor makes sure we realize this. In an equal level, Jared Leto gives one of the best performances not only of his career (perhaps is very best), but also one of the best of the year and one that will surely be remembered for the ages.<br/><br/>DBC is a movie that relies on top quality acting and thank god they got the right actors for it. Surely the biggest contender in both actor categories at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"

","This is a must see film. You can argue about the accuracy of some of the details if you are very familiar with the AIDS epidemic and drug therapy, like I am, but don't. Forget about any such deficiencies you may see and marvel at the simply astonishing performance of Matthew McConaughey. The physical transformation he underwent to play the role is mind blowing, on the level of DeNiro in Raging Bull and then some. And his immersion in the character is even more incredible. Absolutely the best performance of the year. He has some serious competition for the Best Actor Oscar, to be sure, but I hope he wins it. This kind of total performance deserves high praise and recognition. And, the same should be said of Jared Leto without any reservation. That's all you need to know. If you get more out of this film, then that's gravy. Minor deduction made in my rating for some of the literary license taken with reality. The core of the storyline is unfortunately quite real."

","I can't understand why this film is flying so low, under the radar of plaudits. Yes i have heard praise being charitably thrown its way. Coins compared to riches that are pouring over others. It is a spectacular story; incredibly inspiring. I feel no need to divulge information about it as believe me it is best to go (with or without knowledge of the events) and just watch it, enjoy it, soak in what has become a rarity these days of a compelling story, and a riveting powerhouse performance. You maybe get 3 or 4 a year and this is one. A superb film that ironically isn't being weighed down by an unfulfillable bandwagon. I mean when Matthew McConaughey won the Golden Globe for best actor it was seen as a slight shock, when in my book if Di Caprio wasn't going to win it then the next best scenario, without a shadow of doubt, was indeed him. It really is a great performance and a magnificent film. <br/><br/>8.5/10"
"bbewnylorac","8","2","2","15 February 2014"," Great movie
","This movie has got a lot going for it. In Ron Woodroof we have the classic anti-hero -- an arrogant, hard-drinking, womanising electrician who has his entire world overturned when he is diagnosed with HIV. Instead of lying down and dying, he resolves to try to live as long as he can by finding the latest experimental drugs, forms a club to distribute them to others and becomes an unlikely activist against big pharma and the government. Matthew McConaughey is great as Ron -- he has just the right degree of swagger and determination. He doesn't go over the top. Ron never comes across as a saint -- he's got many faults and he constantly makes mistakes but somewhere in there is a good heart. Jared Leto, however trumps him in the role of the transsexual Rayon. Wily, steely yet at times vulnerable, Rayon is a great partner in crime and there are some great scenes, such as when Rayon is touched that Ron sticks up for her in the supermarket when they comes across a bigoted friend from Ron's pre-AIDS days. I love how the period detail such as music, hair and clothes aren't over-done. I love how the movie doesn't go too much for the schmaltzy, meaning of life scenes. To me it's about a quiet but awesome kind of heroism. Ron is someone who wakes up one day and is told he has 30 days to live. He has no one to support him and a very bleak future but he picks himself up and does something about it. I felt the movie was let down a little by a weakly written doctor character played by Jennifer Garner, who has little to do except frown and look worried."
"TheSquiss","8","2","2","14 February 2014"," AIDS will end Ron Woodroof's life, but it just might save his soul.
","1985, Dallas: Electrician and occasional rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a stereotypical redneck who drinks, smokes, snorts and screws his way through life. He is forthright, judgmental, homophobic and upon reading of Rock Hudson's AIDS related death, regards it as just reward for being a ""faggot"". AIDS is, after all, the 'gay plague'.<br/><br/>When Woodroof lands in hospital after an industrial accident and blood results show that he is HIV positive with just 29 days to live, his immediate reaction is rage and denial. He discovers a clinical trial for a new drug, AZT, but his attempts to buy himself onto the trial are thwarted and he is introduced to Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), who offers a different treatment. Woodroof might be ignorant but he is wily, far from stupid and sees a business opportunity. But nothing is straightforward and the disease that will end his life just might save his soul.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club is an insightful reflection of the good that came out of something and someone rotten. Whereas 1993's Philadelphia took on the role of education and breaking down the barriers of homophobia, Jean-Marc Valée's film assumes that we already know what is good and just, and those who still share Woodroof's twisted views won't come within a mile of Dallas Buyers Club.<br/><br/>There is nothing schmaltzy about Dallas Buyers Club. This is not a self-conscious weepy designed to yank on your heartstrings. Yes, it is terribly sad and frequently stirring but it is also funny for the audacity of Woodroof's plans and his doomed flirtations towards his doctor, Eve (Jennifer Garner). More than that, it is sweet and tender with the evolution of Woodroof's relationship with transgender AIDS patient, Rayon (Jared Leto). And in the midst of the quarrels, sickness and political shenanigans, Dallas Buyers Club has time to be silently beautiful, particularly when Woodroof finds himself covered in butterflies. It is a magical moment of calm both for him and for us.<br/><br/>McConaughey is on a fantastic roll of fine performances in a succession of wonderful films (Mud, Killer Joe, The Paperboy). As I have written before, he is in serious danger of becoming a heavyweight amongst Hollywood's royalty if he continues in this vein. Much has been written about his dramatic weight loss for the role and though it is startling, it is not the achievement here that we should celebrate. It is his performance alone that should warrant our attention and admiration.<br/><br/>When you get down to it, Woodroof isn't a terribly nice man; he is the trailer trash brother of Jordan Belfort, but he is real. His prejudices stink and he's never going to be in the running for pope. McConaughey doesn't play him as a beautifully scripted flawed character but as a real man with a body-rotting death sentence who is subjected to the prejudice and hatred he once dished out. With the loss of job and friends and a burgeoning loathing of authority and injustice, Woodroof finds both his cause and his allies in the gay community. McConaughey maintains the abrasiveness and judgment of his character though the direction of it subtly alters. It is a performance that grips the viewer and may well become one that (re)defines McConaughey.<br/><br/>With his sensitive, engaging performance as Rayon, Jared Leto has leapt to the forefront of the cinema-goers' consciousness after a career hitherto as a solid peripheral actor. There is nothing gauche or gaudy about his Rayon and again this is a multifaceted character that is sensual, sassy and terribly damaged by a father's judgment. Leto brings much of the light relief to Dallas Buyers Club though Rayon's story is perhaps more traumatic and affecting than Woodroof's.<br/><br/>Adorned with awards already, when Sunday's BAFTAs arrive and the Oscars shortly after, Dallas Buyers Club may not triumph with the top gong, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to see both McConaughey and Leto walk away with gold. And, no discredit to their fellow nominees, but both will thoroughly deserve it.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"davidgee","8","2","2","11 February 2014"," An uncomfortable trip down Memory Lane
","Matthew McConaughey's performance is the powerhouse at the centre of this movie. The script distorts the historical facts in small but significant ways to give the story momentum and to point up the desperation of the situation HIV patients were in back in those dark days when the only licensed medication was AZT, which was more killer than cure. Ron Woodruff (who was almost certainly bisexual) is here rampantly straight and stridently homophobic until his diagnosis forces him into the company of all those gay men who were the principal victims of Aids in its early days. Rayon, the drag queen who joins Ron in his life-saving enterprise and then becomes his buddy, is a fictitious character but a gift of a part which Jared Leto sinks his teeth into with the kind of relish William Hurt brought to KISS OF THE SPIDER-WOMAN (1985). Jennifer Garner gives a nicely understated performance as the overworked doctor who is not supposed to be sympathetic to Ron's efforts to circumvent the FDA.<br/><br/>For those of us who lost many good friends and colleagues back in that terrible first decade of the Plague Years, this is an uncomfortable trip down Memory Lane. The final scene is ludicrously over-the-top but perhaps forgivable as an attempt to end this morbid movie on a brief high.<br/><br/>DALLAS BUYERS CLUB succeeds at every level, entertaining us with the sheer pace of its story, overwhelming us with the mesmerising acting by Matthew McConaughey (who deserves all the awards that are coming his way) and vividly reminding us of the fatal ineptness with which successive administrations and the pharmaceutical companies responded to the challenge of HIV/Aids."
"cleary-joshua","8","2","2","11 February 2014"," Both fascinating and horrifying, but ultimately flawed in its execution...
","It's Oscar season, and therefore biopic season. So far this Oscar season, I've seen the two true stories: ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Captain Phillips"", both told in extremely different ways. One is a subtle and frequently brutal drama, the other is a gripping thriller. So add to this line up ""Dallas Buyers Club"", a heartfelt, occasionally witty drama about a man who is suffering from AIDS and decides to make some money out of curing the disease. It's an odd set of films to say the very least, and I'm not entirely sure whether this really fits in there. It is both fascinating and horrifying at times, but is ultimately flawed in its execution.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaghey stars as Ron Woodruff, a foul and debauched rodeo cowboy, who suddenly discovers that he is suffering from HIV/AIDS and is given 30 days to live. Unhappy with the medicine available and its effects, he decides to import foreign drugs illegally for both his own personal use, and to sell to others for profit. The man is clearly a genius, constantly finding loopholes and managing to keep the business going, saving a great number of lives. His friendship with Rayon, played by a cross-dressing Jared Leto, is the most interesting part of the film, since Woodruff is originally extremely homophobic and hates the association he gets with the gay people he is saving. He eventually becomes a great friend to Rayon, and their closeness as friends becomes very apparent towards the film's ending.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are stunning, and it is not just McConaghey's weight loss that needs commenting on, even though it is absolutely incredible. Woodruff is portrayed as the perfect anti-hero, saving people's lives but originally for the wrong reasons. I couldn't help but be reminded of Oskar Schindler, a business man like Woodruff who realised his power and saved thousands of Jews. However Woodruff is far more, because he is originally completely foul and offensive to the people that he would eventually go on to save. Jennifer Garner gives undoubtedly the best performance I have ever seen her in, and there is a scene that I don't want to spoil towards the film's end which is completely believable and heartfelt on her part.<br/><br/>Despite all of these great things the film does have its flaws, and like so many films these days, the running time is the main problem. It lasts just under 2 hours, and drags at times where not a lot is happening. The best parts of the film are the more interesting exchanges, and when the plot is static and we're not learning anything new, it feels overly padded. I didn't come out of the film feeling like I'd just experienced an incredible film, but just an interesting story with good characters and fine acting. A small part of me feels cheated that this is up for Best Picture, but ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't.<br/><br/>But these are merely initial reactions to what was on the whole an enjoyable film, and I do recommend it anyway, if only because Matthew McConaghey's performance is one of his finest, and it's an interesting look into one small part of such a poorly documented time in modern American history."
"rubenm","8","2","2","9 February 2014"," Lust For Life
","One of the thoughts I had after seeing 'Dallas Buyers Club', is how quickly time passes. I remember those days of spreading aids panic quite well. Living in Amsterdam at the time, which prides itself on being the gay capital of the world, I witnessed the fear from close by. To me, this seems like not so long ago. But seeing the film, I realize it must be ancient history for many people. <br/><br/>It was a time when it was normal to smoke cigarettes in hospitals. When everyone still drove big, gas-guzzling cars (at least in the US). When mobile phones were a brand new innovation. When the internet didn't exist and you had to go to a local library to get information about a new disease. When homophobia was rampant. When doctors used mouth-caps when they met HIV-positive patients. <br/><br/>But 'Dallas Buyers Club' is more than a very good account of this crucial period in medical history. Its strength is based on the character development, as much as on the historical events. Maybe even more. Essentially this is not a film about aids, but about Ron Woodroof. He slowly transforms from a typical Texas homophobic redneck to an open-minded person who not only accepts gay persons as his friends, but even stands up for them and learns to love them in his own way. Not in a melodramatic, tear-jerking way, but naturally, without his losing his foul-mouthed and no-holds-barred lifestyle. <br/><br/>Much has been said about Matthew McConaughey's wonderful acting in this film. But almost just as good and remarkable is Jared Leto as his gay 'partner in crime' Rayon. Both men are complete opposites, but they find each other in their will to live, and fight the disease that threatens this ambition. Woodroof is determined to take the anti-aids treatments the FDA won't allow. By selling the semi-illegal aids drugs, he is drawn closer to the gay community most of his clients belong to. <br/><br/>The film focuses on the characters of Woodroof and Rayon, and less on the legal war between the FDA and the aids patients. Some of the legal aspects of the story remain shady. Why has the sale of the semi-illegal drugs to be organized through 'Buyers Clubs'? Why could Japanese companies only sell Japanese drugs to Japanese doctors? What exactly are the stakes of the final lawsuit between Woodroof and the FDA? The film doesn't spell out the answers to these questions, but that doesn't really matter. We understand the main problem: the FDA's procedures are not suitable for an immediately life-threatening disease like aids. <br/><br/>The story is divided in numbered days after Woodroof's diagnosis, counting from 'day 1' tot 'day 2265' or so, when he dies after seven years instead of the thirty days the doctors had given him initially. This is a nice and smart feature: the higher the day count, the more the audience supports Woodroof and his lust for life."
"jdkraus","9","2","2","7 February 2014"," An ultimate character study that shows us how one man can evolve and live with dignity
","""Dallas Buyer's Club"" is about Ron Woodroof, a man who works as an electrician and moonlights as a rodeo rider. To say in the least, this film is a character study. The opening scene sets the standard for what type of guy Ron is—a sleazy drug abuser and alcoholic who enjoys threesomes with beautiful girls. He is your typical white-trash Texan hick. However, when he turns up HIV positive, or as he calls a ""faggot disease,"" this puts him in a situation of desperation. He heads to Mexico in hopes of obtaining a new experimental medication. He later befriends a modestly polite trans-gendered man named Rayon and starts a business with him, which involves smuggling non-FDA approved drugs for AIDS patients and selling them, dubbing this business as The Dallas Buyer's Club. <br/><br/>While Ron's character is anything but admirable, his actions prove otherwise. He goes above and beyond to what was initially only helping himself into an individual who cares and assists for those he once discriminated. He evolves and becomes a passionate and larger than life character. Facing imminent death either brings out either the best or worst in us. It is the former with Ron. It's more than comprehensible as to why McConaughey has earned the recognition he has been receiving for his performance. He immerses himself into this person's persona with flawless perfection and he carries the film with bold energy. Viewers might as well forget about the dreadful movies he has made in the past years. This is a new, reborn actor altogether. To make me enjoy a character that I would not normally like in real life is awe- inspiring. Bravo Mr. McConaughey. Bravo!<br/><br/>Jared Leto as Rayon takes acting to a new level. Who would have thought that an actor who has not been in a movie for four years could transform his appearance, voice, mannerisms, and personality into a unique character like Rayon? Perhaps even the sturdiest method actors could not master this challenge and Leto does so with finesse. He is a real screen stealer and he plays his character with stark empathy and even a hint of pity. He gives us someone we can care about. I honestly could not get enough of him. I wish he had been given much more screen time. Jennifer Garner fills in as a backseat rider, playing the doctor who tries to help Ron and Rayon. Though she does not achieve greatness as McConaughey or Leto, she does make a likable and emotional character.<br/><br/>The visual style relies heavily on a documentary-esque technique—mostly hand-held filmed under natural lighting conditions with field/on-location audio recording (note: making some of the dialog hard to hear at times). The cinematographer captures the film's plot with tight close- ups and other claustrophobic-like angles, forcing the audience into the uncomfortable, emotionally intense situations of the characters. The editing progresses the story relatively decently, but it feels rushed in some subplots and overly drawn out in others. The high-pitched frequency sound effect used to emphasis the progressing illness/AIDS symptoms and growing disorientation of the main character adds another measure of subliminal feeling.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyer's Club"" is not a movie meant for everyone, especially for people sensitive towards homosexuals and perhaps even die-hard neo-conservatives. Nor is this a fun one to watch on a day-to-day basis. This is a film that stands on goodness and shows us that despite all circumstances, one man can change and try to make a positive difference for others who cannot. It also shows us that people like Ron Woodroof will not go down in death without dignity or a fight. 9/10<br/><br/>This is one of the best films of the year."
"zuhair_v","8","2","2","7 February 2014"," When underdogs shine
","'I still got HIV?'<br/><br/>The naivety forged in that one line alone has made me regain my faith in McConaughey, he has my respect as an actor again.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1985 with the news of Rock Hudson being treated for HIV in a Paris hospital (on a newspaper dated July 25th; Hudson died on October 2nd, same year) and his sexual preference.<br/><br/>'D'ya hear Rock Hudson was a c*ck sucker?'.<br/><br/>'All that fine Hollywood pussy just bein' wasted on a guy who smokes his fu*king friends.' - McConaughey spews those lines with pristine hate and disgust. This is where we begin to understand Woodroof.<br/><br/>Back in the Eighties the disease was widely associated with homosexuals and bisexuals. It was perceived to be contained within latter category. To have AIDS was a taboo, it still is and this film tells us the true story of Ron Woodroof; a rodeo, a hustler and a promiscuous drug addict whose discrimination against gay people and racial slurs are as potent as a Black Mamba's bite.<br/><br/>As we move on we sense the red-tape, the payoffs and the FDA regulations, which bar better and safer medicines to help AIDS patients lead normal life compared to patients being treated (still) with AZT; a prescription drug that gives temporary relief and a sooner death by decreasing the T cells and the overall immunity of the body. Woodroof heads to Mexico to smuggle in the safer, more effective medicines. The immigration interrogation scenes are ingenious. <br/><br/>Jared Leto has always been one of my favourite underdogs, right from 'Requiem for a Dream, 2000' to 'Alexander, 2004' and now this. His range is wide and carries a sense of mysterious sensuality with it. Oliver Stone realised that. In 'Club', Leto is brilliant, confident and quite appropriately dressed for the part that he pulls it off smooth as a hustle hand.<br/><br/>As Woodroof develops full blown AIDS, he changes. The change is shown in many ways. The film reaches out to us and simply tells us how and what is it like on the other side of sunshine. As Woodroof's entrepreneurship grows it faces prosecution from the FDA, the IRS and the police but it also gives people time to live 'normal' lives. A once hardened hillbilly, cowboy will always be that, even if the odds are perpetually against him.<br/><br/>Rediscover McConaughey and revel in the tale of one determined son of a bitch who, by the end, is frail and exhausted yet he puts on his aviators, grabs the long braided ropes on the bull and dives right into the deep of saddle bronc riding.<br/><br/>However, not before a slight nod that he slips into the scene. A nod that stays with you for a long time."
"Reno-Rangan","9","2","2","7 February 2014"," If 'The Machinist' for Christian Bale then 'Dallas Buyers Club' for Matthew McConaughey
","Day by day, movie by movie he's getting better and better. Who? Matthew McConaughey. I thought 'The Lincoln Lawyer' was his best, but then 'Mud' came and I was shocked about his performance. Now even better in this movie, in fact the best from all of them. The first thing popped out in my mind was the Christian Bale's 'The Machinist'. Because of his weight reduce for the role in the movie was phenomenal. In this movie as well McConaughey did same homework for a movie character and it was just awesome.<br/><br/>You can ask anybody who saw the movie will say McConaughey's performance was astonishing. But you know what I surprised in the movie other than him, Jared Leto. You will gonna observe his next best performance in here only after 'Mr. Nobody'. Yeah, I was shocked by his appearance, he totally had the movie along with McConaughey.<br/><br/>The movie was based on the real story about a person from the 80s who had HIV+. The movie briefs his struggle to survive against the dangerous disease as well fight against the law. The story was very good, it says 'no matter what, you never give up'. How far would you go to fight in order to survive when law and medicine failed its duty along with losing your best buddies. It was just like the other perspective of story to 'Puncture' where a man fights to prevent spreading this same disease.<br/><br/>If 'The Machinist' for Christian Bale then 'Dallas Buyers Club' for Matthew McConaughey. He nailed it, the character was totally looked like from the state of Texas and none others would have done like him. Definitely one of the front runners for Oscar in the best actor category. This great performance will be a biggest breakthrough in his career for sure. And that makes he's in watch-out list from now on."
"peterp-450-298716","7","2","2","6 February 2014"," An example of impressive acting
","I swear it, Ray, God sure was dressin' the wrong doll when he blessed you with a set of balls.<br/><br/>I admit. Everyone will probably repeat this infinitely times. The acting of Matthew McConaughey is irrefutable top level. I'll do it just one more time ... the acting of Matthew McConaughey is top level ! After I saw him in ""The Lincoln Lawyer "" where he plays a lawyer who works from out of his Lincoln, there was a sign of sheer acting talent in the movie ""Mud"". ""Mud"" isn't an average movie. You like it or you hate it. But it it does show that he isn't an ordinary actor. The metamorphosis in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is even more spectacular. Physically it must have been quite a sacrifice in order to lose that much weight. The image of him lying in the hospital next to Rayon and his hospital pajamas reveal a skinny leg, is shocking at the time. How he plays that hotheaded Woodroof sometimes, is really a joy to watch. With that Texas accent he talks like a cheeky rascal and a few moments later it sounds flattering and seductive. He likes to taste the pleasures of life : Sex , Drugs and Rock 'n Roll. I must admit I hardly recognised him at the beginning with that big mustache, those big glasses, the stetson on his head and that skinny body. The moment they told him in the hospital he had AIDS was memorable. The way he reacts is a perfect display of how a heterosexual person would react that never used hard drugs (using a needle). He denies it completely and rejects the assumption to have AIDS. Instead, he returns to his camper and organizes with his drinking buddies a wild orgy with lots of booze, cocaine and willing rodeo ladies.<br/><br/>Jared Leto plays the role of Rayon brilliantly. A transvestite who tries to bound with Ron, but gets taunted by the latter in a humiliating way. The moment Rons friends turn their backs at him (also a strong fragment) and they avoid him like he's a leper, is the point he starts tolerating Rayon, although he keeps making teasing remarks. Leto was convincing as an addicted but attractive transvestite.<br/><br/>During the whole movie there is an interaction between dramatic and humorous moments. There is the monopolizing role of the FDA in terms of legalized medication. They focus more on the profit margins and seem to forget about the effective healing effects of certain medications. You can enjoy the humor both in conversations as in certain situations that arise. The bond of friendship that develops gradually between Ron and Rayon is the main storyline.<br/><br/>Frankly, it was hugely entertaining until the club was founded. From there it was a little less interesting and actually more of a boring presentation of Ron who travels the world looking for suppliers and new drug cocktails. And again a fight against the FDA while Ron gradually degenerates (although this isn't actually shown explicitly). A strong,humorous and touching start that significantly begins to captivate to the end. Personally I think the role of Eve by Jennifer Garner even was a minimal contribution to the whole. The doctor in Mexico was, compared to her, a more interesting character role.<br/><br/>In ""Philadelphia"" the movie got weaker by dragging in the cliché court scenes. In this movie it's the constant fight against a government agency such as the FDA which begins to irritate. But despite that, it's a hell of a movie, with two excellent performances done by two excellent actors.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

","The story of ""an unsung hero who brought hope to those who had none""<br/><br/>Amidst a lot of sexual scenes and swearing is a true story with a lot of depth and heart. Ron Woodroof part time rodeo cowboy and full time electrician from Dallas Texas was an avid drug user and womaniser, known for his country ways and homophobia, Woodroof contracted aids from an unknown origin in the 1980s. A time when aids was still a death sentence and the FDA had one product AZT- a product that was fast tract to human trials with limited evidence as to its actual benefits. Woodroof was given 30 days to live, and as a risk taker made a bet that he wouldn't let aids win so easily. The Dallas Buyers club tells the story of Woodroof's journey to finding not a cure but drugs that would ease the pain and symptoms and give people more time. Woodroof eventually found drugs, minerals and vitamins (all non-approved by the FDA) with promising results for HIV positive patients not available in the USA but in other countries such as Germany, China, Japan and Mexico. As selling non approved drugs are illegal to move in the USA, Woodroof set up the Dallas buyers club with his business partner and fellow aids victim Rayon (Jared Leto) whereby they would sell membership and give the drugs for ""free"".<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey first signed up to the feature 5 years ago, however the film had been in the making for a further 15. Screenwriter Craig Borten inspired by an article about the infamous Dallas buyers club, met with Woodroof a month before his passing (in 1992) in order to gain as much information as possible to make his real life story come to life on the big screen. The film was initially set to be made in the early 90s with Woody Harrelson cast as the lead and Dennis hopper set to direct, however the movie lacked support and was pushed forward each time, dropping actors and directors along the way. Amongst the list to play the main role were: Brad Pitt (late 1990s, with Marc Foster to direct), Ryan Gosling (2008, with director Craig Gillespie) and then finally Matthew McConaughey (with director Jean-Marc Vallée).<br/><br/>Due to the symptoms of HIV both Leto and McConaughey adopted extreme weight loss regimes in order to appear daunt and ill for their roles. Leto dropped 30lbs whereas McConaughey lost about 50lbs. Their dedication to the roles were undeniable in their physical and emotional presence on screen. McConaughey has made strides rather than steps from the Rom-Com shirtless male lead to Oscar worthy roles as that of the Dallas buyers club.<br/><br/>This biopic directed by Jean-Marc Vallée successfully educates the audience with this bold story of the pain and anguish suffered by an unsung hero who brought hope to those who had none (but at a price).<br/><br/>4 Stars ****<br/><br/>The film is currently nominated for 6 Oscars:<br/><br/>1. Best Motion Picture of the Year.<br/><br/>2. Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role – Matthew McConaughey.<br/><br/>3.

"freemantle_uk","8","2","2","4 February 2014"," A brilliantly acted bio-pic
","Matthew McConaughey used to be the butt of many jokes: but in recent years he has had an acting resurgence in recent years, earning himself an Oscar nomination for Dallas Buyers Club, being considered one of the leading contenders. Dallas Buyers Club is a very compelling film about Ron Woodroof, a homophobic, yet intelligent redneck who is diagnosed with AIDS and has only 30 days to live. But after taking an experimental drug, AZT, actually makes his health worst he ends up taking an alternative course of treatment in Mexico, leading Woodroof to import drugs into America which are not approved by the FDA and selling memberships for a Buyers Club which he would give AIDS sufferers alternative drugs. But as AZT makes sufferers worst, the DEA and FDA targets Woodroof and his Buyers Club.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a superbly acted film, deserving of the nominations McConaughey and Jared Leto have received. Both were excellent and believable as they display raw emotions and go through a physical and mental change during the film. Woodroof goes through a journey of enlightenment as views and motives have changed. Jennifer Garner too was excellent in the film as a doctor who supports Woodroof and Rayon (Leto) and it is a shame she has not received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Marc Vallee and writers Craig Borton and Melisa Wallack do an excellent job at showcasing the period and culture of the time, showing the rampant homophobia and lack of understanding about HIV and AIDS with people thinking only gay people catch the disease and people can catch the disease in the most minor way possible. They show Woodroof's alienation and rejection from his friends and having to start again because of the culture he lived in. Vallee uses TV news reports to get effect at showing the wider picture involving the approval of drugs and how AIDS sufferers were protesting the FDAs feet dragging.<br/><br/>Vallee lets performances play out naturally by using a hand-held approach and following actors in long takes, using cuts appropriately. But I do think he was a little lazy at overusing a technique of playing a loud high-pitch noise and smash cutting to black when something really bad or emotional happened.<br/><br/>There were some fictional element but the film does felt authentic about the drama and the world it portrayed, getting many details right. But by the third act the film felt a little rushed and if I have to nitpick it felt a bit too convenient that Woodroof's cop friend was around for police raids and for dramatic moments.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a brilliantly acted, compelling drama that is worth checking out."
"hkauteur","9","2","2","2 February 2014"," HK Auteur film review - Dallas Buyers Club
","In 1985, Ron Woodroff (Matthew McConaughey), an electrician and avid rodeo enthusiast with homophobic views, contracts the HIV virus and is given 30 days to live. His doctor Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), tells him about the testing of an anti-viral drug named AZT – a drug thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. Discovering that AZT is actually harmful, he switches to other non-FDA approved drugs ddC and peptide T and partners with Rayon, a transgender woman (Jared Leto), and creates the Dallas Buyers Club, providing drugs to patients for a membership fee.<br/><br/>Making his resurgence this year with a return to dramatic roles, Matthew McConaughey dives into the Ron Woodroff character with an incomparable passion and commitment in years. The monologue McConaughey delivered in the finale of A Time to Kill sent chills down my spine years ago, and since then I have been waiting for years for him to quit doing romantic comedies and now the wait is finally over. Looking dangerously emaciated and painfully frail, McConaughey brings a complex humanity beneath the swindling, trashy, rude exterior in Ron Woodroff. Never in any circumstance would you ever want to hang out with Woodroff, but you feel sympathy for his plight and cheer him on as he rids of his homophobia and starts helping other people. This is McConaughey's career best.<br/><br/>From the sparse art-house way he chooses his parts and dividing time with his music career, Jared Leto has gone unnoticed under the radar, most people still only remember him from My So-Called Life. Rayon is the single most compelling on screen character I have seen this year. Leto tackles the role with such love and human warmth, breathing charm and a sense of humor into Rayon, the role transcends from being a flamboyant woman trapped inside a man's body but a human being who desires to be truly loved. As Rayon tells her estranged father in a scene, ""It's not a choice."" I would never presume to know the life experience of transgender people, but after seeing Leto's deeply moving performance I feel much closer. Campaign or awards politics aside, both actors should win the Oscars, period.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Marc Vallée adopts a hand-held cinéma vérité style that brings rawness and immediacy, taking its heavy subject matter head-on and naturally lets the characters tell the story. Even with the latter introduction of the FDA subplot, the story never becomes a political debate about whether the law truly meets human needs. Dallas Buyers Club is a fascinating, powerfully moving story and told passionately by its makers. It is one of the year's best films."
"pcrprimer","9","2","2","26 January 2014"," Powerhouse performances by both Leto and McConaughey
","Admittedly, I didn't know anything about what the Dallas Buyers Club was prior to watching this movie. I did however know how HIV and AIDS were viewed in the 80s, and I think that this would be a very accurate representation of that. Most of the publicity has been given to the performance of McConaughey, but I think Leto has not received the public attention that it deserves in spite of the Golden Globe victory. Aside from physically losing a lot of weight, the accents and mannerisms are spot on for both actors. The movie effectively shows a very tumultuous time in the 80s, and how things once were. The bullriding scene at the end definitely has symbolic value, though I'm not exactly sure what it means aside from how Ron lived his life possibly."
"Jacobhemphill96","9","2","2","26 January 2014"," One of the best films I've ever seen.
","So many people rip on McConaughey, saying he's a bad actor. I honestly do not see how anyone can think such a thing. He is incredible and Dallas Buyers Club definitely takes the cake. He plays Ron Woodroof a rodeo cowboy and electrician who is diagnosed with the HIV virus and only given 30 days to live. He is told about a new drug called AZT that hopefully will help slow down the virus. He illegally obatains the drug through shady deals with a janitor at the hospital he's at. Shortly afterward he's back in the hospital and finds the drug AZT to worsen the situation. Sharing the hospital room is Rayon, a transvestite played by Jared Leto in a brilliant performance. Though initially hostile toward Rayon the two obtain much better vitamins and minerals from Mexico and start the dallas buyers club for all the AIDS patients. The charge is $400 a membership and if your a member you get all the drugs you want. I don't wanna give anything else away so just let me say definitely go see this movie"
"Laakbaar","8","2","2","25 January 2014"," A great story, well told
","Something went very right with this movie. The direction, writing and acting all blended perfectly into a rich and interesting film that expertly shows us a 1985 Dallas we never knew. Vallée tells a good story about the lives of people most of us will never meet. Vallée is clearly a director to keep an eye on.<br/><br/>The plot is this: an ordinary Joe (a straight redneck type) gets AIDS, has problems getting properly treated, and stumbles onto alternatives that seem to work better than the drugs being tested on him. Like others, he tries to make money from his discovery by smuggling in some drugs and selling these alternatives outside the pharmaceutical and medical system. He becomes popular. The doctors and FDA get onto his case and do what they can to shut him down. He fights back and becomes a hero.<br/><br/>Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey are astounding. McConaughey's portrayal of Woodruff's desperation and addiction is harrowing. I have to confess to you that I didn't even realize Rayon was being played by Jared Leto until I got home. These fine Oscar-worthy performances rival the ones delivered in American Hustle. When did McConaughey and Leto get so damn good? We used to joke that McConaughey took his shirt off in every movie.<br/><br/>There are many details in this tapestry. You'd have to see it several times to catch it all. The filmmaker has a lot of things to say about fate, class, how we deal with illness, the American medical system, medical ethics, sex and relationships, addiction, homophobia, and so on. At times this is a gritty, uncomfortable movie to watch.<br/><br/>What I also liked about it is that the dialogue and the various scenes rang true. <br/><br/>Woodruff (played by McConaughey) was a great character. A scrappy, difficult lowlife addict who saw an opportunity and had enough wherewithal to take advantage of it. Regardless of whether Woodruff is actually like this, this is the kind of character McConaughey can really sink his teeth into. A redneck rebel loser fighting the system.<br/><br/>McConaughey's irascible Woodruff kept the film from becoming too much of a downer or too melodramatic. The movie is not a tearjerker. It's difficult to feel sorry for someone like Woodruff. Nor would he want you to feel that way. It's a good thing that the movie avoided too much melodrama and pathos, because with this subject matter it could easily have gone down that road.<br/><br/>This movie is worth about 8.5, but I'm going to round it down for a few reasons.<br/><br/>I understand the movie oversells certain points. Was Woodruff actually right, as the movie seems to say? Is AZT that evil? Is Peptide-T that important? Was the FDA as evil as portrayed in the movie? From what I've read, this was not the case. Does anyone today even agree with this movie's point of view about the buyers clubs and AZT? It's a bit too easy to blame the government and big pharma.<br/><br/>Also, I'm ashamed to say that my judgmentalism towards drug users, addicts and losers stood in the way of my being able to fully enjoy the film.<br/><br/>I found the movie a little slow at one point, and it was a little too serious for my liking.<br/><br/>It's timely to have an AIDS movie because too many young people are not wearing condoms."
"vikas-taank","9","2","2","25 January 2014"," Astoundingly Brilliant Cinema
","Dallas Buyer's Club well, actually raised my standards of evaluating a sensible cinematic creation. After watching ""Wolf of the wall street"" , I didn't find this movie below par in any of the standard and surprisingly it appealed me in the subtlest way. Mathew , the lead actor has proved his mettle in the sub prime of his career. Mathew McConnuaghey for being so original and you can't imagine this kind of performance unless you watch this flick. He made himself loud and heard. Watched him in cameo in wolf of the wall street and trust me he sounds like a seasoned actor. You can't miss Mark Hanna from wolf of the wall street. The movie reminds me of one of the finest movies I have ever watch like Requiem for a dream and Magnolia or the Trainspotting. You must watch this enigmatically plotted and so original movie of this year and the years to come. If I have to choose between Mathew and McConnuaghey for the Academy Award for the best Actor in the lead role, I would vote for Mathew . Sorry De Caprio I would give the old timer a chance to be known for his excellent acting."
"shawneofthedead","9","2","2","22 January 2014"," A bruising, beautiful story of survival against the bleakest of odds.
","For almost two decades, the intense, thought-provoking script for Dallas Buyers Club made the rounds in Hollywood. At various points in its troubled, scrappy lifetime, directors like Marc Forster and Craig Gillespie and actors including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling had been attached to the project. Each time, plans fell through and the movie never got made. Finally, in 2013, this last incarnation of Dallas Buyers Club - sensitively directed by Vallée and starring McConaughey as a physically ravaged victim of AIDS - was cobbled together on a paltry budget of US$5 million. The result is electrifying, and easily one of the best films of 2013.<br/><br/>Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is a fast-living, rough-talking rodeo cowboy and electrician - a man of bigoted, homophobic views, who's living and dying in Dallas in 1985. He doesn't realise how swiftly he's dying, however, until a chance accident lands him in hospital, where he's diagnosed with HIV and given thirty days to live. Desperate and determined not to give in to his diagnosis, Ron bribes a hospital worker to get him samples of experimental drug AZT. When he realises that AZT might be more harmful than helpful, he starts smuggling unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into the country - first for his own personal use, then for the fellow AIDS victims who join his Dallas Buyers Club.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club certainly sounds like it might be an exercise in sentimental claptrap: a difficult man is softened by his illness and receives a second lease on life, during which he becomes a champion for the very individuals against whom he used to harbour irrational, discriminatory hate. It hardly seems original, and should be something you've seen a hundred times before.<br/><br/>But Vallée's film burns bright and fierce, in much the same way as Ron does. The character work in Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack's screenplay is sublime. Rude, ornery and devilishly confident, Ron remains a prickly bastard throughout, strangely selfless in how gloriously selfish he is. At one point, he's offered the use of a house to conduct his largely illegal business - and he just can't fathom how or why people would want to help him out for free. He staggers and swaggers through the film, refusing to die when the doctors say he should, tough and confrontational to the end.<br/><br/>The people who come into Ron's life when all his friends have left it are just as lovingly realised. The unlikely bond between Ron and Rayon (Leto) – an AIDS-positive transgender woman – forms the emotional cornerstone of the film. Rayon first falls afoul of Ron's casual discrimination before she becomes an essential part of his business. The way in which she takes up residence in his life is executed skilfully - in small rather than big gestures, in tiny moments that build into a spiky, credible friendship that's all the more effective for being so genuine.<br/><br/>Ron's relationship with Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) is similarly well-developed. It begins in adversarial fashion, with Eve no doubt writing Ron off as a jerk when he practically explodes with denial over his diagnosis. But Eve, too, gets a second chance in life to go on a smaller journey, as she tries to reconcile her chosen profession with its almost callous disregard for the millions of HIV-positive people who are wasting away without access to drugs that might actually help them.<br/><br/>Anyone who's not watched Dallas Buyers Club might wonder why McConaughey and Leto have been scooping up accolades galore during awards season. Cynics will chalk it up to the extreme physical transformations they both underwent for the sake of the film. McConaughey lost 21kg off his sun-bronzed, muscle-bound frame; he is skin stretched across bone, older and more fragile than you've ever seen him. Leto shed almost 14kg for his role, before donning a layer of make-up and an array of skirts.<br/><br/>But it's what the duo do with their ravaged bodies that's truly remarkable. McConaughey has spent the last two years steadily chipping away at his rom-com past, and seals the deal with Ron Woodroof. He is staggeringly good in the part, refusing to water down the character or make an obvious play for audiences' hearts. Instead, he disappears almost completely into Ron's stubborn refusal to accept his death sentence - it's somehow touching that, in McConaughey's hands, Ron's vulnerability doesn't shine through in a scene when he breaks down and sobs, but in a tender, odd moment in a greenlit room full of butterflies.<br/><br/>Leto, too, is unforgettable as Rayon, who shimmers through the film - a bright, swirling mess of life, love and, tragically, addiction. It would be easy to marvel solely at Leto's physical transformation, but there's so much more to his performance. Rayon feels achingly real, her heartbreak and yearning trapped inside a body that doesn't fit the way it should.<br/><br/>It would be easy to assume the worst of Dallas Buyers Club - to think that it'd be predictable and gloomy, brooding and preachy in its misappropriation of Ron's life. Certainly, it leaves out some crucial facts to create a more streamlined story: Ron had a sister and daughter who don't feature in the film at all, and AZT is demonised to an extent that ignores its life-saving properties for AIDS patients in lowered dosages (save for a title card in the end credits).<br/><br/>Taken for what it is, however, the unexpectedly funny Dallas Buyers Club is a beautiful heartbreaker of a film: one that, like its main character, teeters constantly on the edge of death, but is really about the power, joy and possibilities of life. Ron Woodroof is the unlikeliest of heroes, because he's not a hero at all: just an ordinary man who - while fighting, scheming and hustling for his life - figures out a way to help other people too. It's as prickly, complex and oddly uplifting as any story about hope and survival can be."

","I saw both Club and Hustle this past weekend. Hustle has great acting but left me a little cold when it came to the characters. Club on the other hand, pulled me in emotionally, allowing me to care for this group of characters. MM and Leto both are amazing in this film. MM is going to win the Oscar and Leto is a revelation, also locking in the Oscar for supporting actor. If there ever was a sure thing, place your bets on these two guys for Oscar gold! I found the conflict for the Ron Woodroof character to be very interesting, having to fight his lifelong macho upbringing to now, very clearly, seeing how the other half lives, by truly walking in there shoes.

","When I was growing up – more specifically: coming out, I saw a ton of films based on/around AIDS. It didn't help that I came out during the unfortunate AIDS boom of the early to late 1990s.<br/><br/>I was indeed sad because I didn't have many films or media to attach onto during these troubling times. But, mercifully, I did not ever acquire AIDS. If I had, that is, I wish God would've granted me the pleasure of meeting the real leads in this fantastic film.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club showed me a completely different and (wow) thinner side of Matthew McConaughey. He lost so much weight for this role – that's obvious, but his change in character from within, his depth, his tone and stance stood above all else in this movie.<br/><br/>Naturally, you meet this person in the beginning of his journey, this Ron played by McConaughey, and you would hate him as much as I did. But, his mercifully and absolutely joyous transformation – even when infected – is breathtaking. This man, McConaughey, will earn his first Best Actor Oscar just as much as Heath Ledger did for The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Now, this is not to take away from Jared Leto's fantastic performance as Ron's ""pal,"" Rayon, or the other great actors in this film. Everyone did their part, as did the movie. Original, bright, fresh, engaging and thoughtful, Dallas Buyers Club surprised me and kept me going.<br/><br/>Incredibly straight (as he will mention many, many times) electrician and part-time rodeo rider, Ron, acquires AIDS from one of his many, many female partners. After a (long) bit of acceptance and defying the odds, he becomes one of the less sought out drug-for-good dealers for the AIDS community.<br/><br/>There are no heroes here. No one to cling to while you watch. But, there are humans. Humans that do eventually make you want to become friends with and side with. Some you want to learn more about and do better with your own life.<br/><br/>Soon into this wonderful feature, you will forget the lead is Matthew McConaughey and know this person as Ron. Someone who was an ass, someone who is dying and someone who comes back to right his wrongs.<br/><br/>McConaugheyyou have my vote for Best Actor for the 2013 Oscars. You better damn get it. And the rest of youyou better damn see this movie.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: I feel bad for Jared Leto. He did excellent here and in any other movie, he would shine and erase anyone else off the screen in the viewer's memories. But, McConaughey was just that good, Leto, in all his fabulousness, will just have to wait for another picture to show how good he/she is."

","I remember when the AIDS disease became the epidemic in the 80's - I worked in a hospital and the education we received was very involved. To watch the reactions by Ron Woodruff's friends with the news of his diagnosis is accurately portrayed. The film does a good job of the things that those with AIDS went through. The frustration of the victims in getting treatment, of having the respect they deserve as a human being. Matthew McConaughey is not my favorite actor - but this performance is incredible. He shows his anger, frustration, his weaknesses and his smarts - and it is all so believable. Jared Leto gives an award winning performance - he does an incredible performance of another troubled man in this imperfect world. He deserves many more acting roles - such a good talent. An incredible movie about an imperfect person who made a difference and so well presented."
"EmpireBusiness","9","2","2","17 January 2014"," Phenomenal
","Every few years we come across a movie that provides us with more than what we can take in. Make no mistake, Dallas Buyers Club is one. It is unlike other similar films where the protagonist who deals with a deadly disease and tries to overcome it with sex or ticking boxes on their bucket list. We can expect a few scenes that are mainstream in these kind of movies but don't take this movie for granted. <br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey impresses you so much that you actually start to question if it is indeed him. He fits the profile perfectly and I loved the way his physical appearance keeps changing throughout the movie but his acting remains A+. <br/><br/>The movie makes us think about us as human beings and how death can motivate someone so much that it makes a huge difference on the society. If someone with very less time on his hands can achieve something so big and win so many hearts, what are we all doing with our lives? This movie plants that question deep inside our thoughts.<br/><br/>I loved how they didn't exactly kill him off on screen towards the end of the movie like all these movies usually do. I needed some time alone after watching this movie. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and think about making this world a better place."

","First, let me start off by saying this is by far one of the most powerful, and moving films I've seen in recent history.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey was spectacular as an HIV-stricken heterosexual man, alongside Jared Leto, who was extremely convincing as a Pre-Op Transvestite. Not to mention Jennifer Garner's stunning performance.<br/><br/>While having a few risqué scenes here and there, the film itself was extremely engrossing and absorbing. I was glued the entire time.<br/><br/>I wont say anymore, as I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but it was spectacular, and I urge everyone to give it the chance it deserves.<br/><br/>8.5/10 (8.1/10 on IMDb)"
"cordenw","5","18","37","18 January 2014"," Not bad, a little thin on interest level but watchable.
","Talking about thin, Matthew did go to the limit with his method acting here. I've seen more meat on a jockey's whip... but that's what he had to do to make an essentially weak film hold your attention. I thought Jennifer Garner was a bit of a cardboard cut out, as were all of the medical staff, but the guys at the bar were pretty convincing. <br/><br/>Anytime they show Texas in a movie I'm hooked, so I'm going to watch 'til the end, even if the dust turns to mud as it did in the latter parts of this show. The casting guys in Hollywood have drawn a big blank with Feds lately and this gang are just as hollow as the other big movies. Mind you I did work with a lot of them in my time and a lot of them were ungulates like these characters. Could be they did it on purpose. <br/><br/>Is it just me or are the movies replacing cigarettes with cocaine these days and promoting it as a lifestyle? There must be some sort of policy change going on to legalize it (and collect taxes), as the last three movies I've seen have the protagonists snorting it through garden hoses; American Hustle, The Wolf of Wall Street etc. It seems to be an essential part of any plot if you want it to get on the screen. I must live a very sheltered life because none of the people I know do it... mind you I live in an old people's home! <br/><br/>So before they bring me my pills I should summarize; Pretty lightweight stuff, we all know that the FDA is a tainted organization but the script could have done a better job with the material at hand. I prefer Matthew in his lawyer or handsome brute roles, this was straying too far from his paydirt. The rest of the cast could have come from one of those CSI shows that I never watch."

","A friend of mine told me today that the film had made quite an impact on him, and I couldn't agree with him anymore if I tried. It did move me quite a bit, too because it did something very few films are able to achieve: to tell a story with honesty, without flashy effects, distracting cinematography or editing tricks. This one focused on the story, the acting, and the message.<br/><br/>Most of the credit should go to the two leading actors. Both Matthew and Jared are sensational, combining their drastic transformations to portray the characters as realistic as possible, but no make up or gimmickry would have worked if it hadn't been because these two gentlemen poured their souls into the project. They channeled the entire range of emotions that must have existed in those two extraordinary individuals. Both were flawed human beings who recognized their differences and similarities, who sought the best in the other, and who tried hard to make a difference while living under very difficult conditions.<br/><br/>The story deals with a man who tries at first to come up with a way to survive, only to realize there is a market in the suffering of others, but unlike the establishment that he ends up fighting, he discovers his soul aches when he realizes that profits sometimes result in more pain or even death. He learns to understand that the differences in perception are the result of the environment we're raised in, that we will never understand the others unless we walk in their shoes. He also realizes that there is blood money involved, and that the money gods are indeed difficult to resist or conquer.<br/><br/>Here is an extraordinary man who is given a month to get his affairs in order and ends up surviving nearly eight years, dealing with his own handicaps and all the other obstacles he encounters as he first saves himself, saves others, and tries to tell the world that there might be a way to stop many from dying, but this might prove to be too much of a battle.<br/><br/>It is a moving story that will hit you hard because it hides very little. Rayon is a particularly heartbreaking character, with sad eyes that shine with hope, yet are clouded by the horrific realization that death is around the corner. His scene with his father is shattering, and his interactions with his partner will make believe that there is always room for hope and love. The story presents everyone without portraying anyone as special, perfect, but as real people with real problems and real pain.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" might start as a cynical and hard film to watch, but it does earn one's respect, admiration, and most importantly love. There is still hope for Hollywood to find real gems in the middle of the artificiality that we so often encounter."

In ""The Dallas Buyers Club"", Ron Woodroof does just that. Sure, he's in it for himself, sure he has little or no respect for the members of his buyers club, but through months of contact and shared life tragedy, he begins to care for others, despite himself. <br/><br/>His is not a transformation of Biblical proportions. Woodroof is a man who learns first hand what it means to navigate the medical system and deal with the FDA, who is the big villain in the movie, near the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. He may be a homophobe, but he hates the government more and learns to sympathize with gay men, at least in regards to healthcare. <br/><br/>His career and his upbringing have taught him that women are for sex, period, and his macho hereto-posturing influences his homophobic reactions in the movie. However, that homophobia gets played back at him as people learn he has AIDS. Jared Leto is excellent as Rayon, a club member and gay sidekick to Ron. His character might be a bit twisted, ala Devine, for the Academy. But he should get an Oscar nomination. As will Matthew McConaguhey. If it wasn't for Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance as the sympathetic Solomon Northup in ""12 Years a Slave"", McConaguhey would have a good chance at an Oscar. In many ways his performance was harder, more multidimensional and complicated then Ejiofor's. This is a year when two performers could win and would be deserving. But the character of Ron Woodroof is despicable in so many ways (and why I think McConaguhey was so good) that the academy can't give it to him. Besides, Mr. Ejiofor is also Oscar worthy. <br/><br/>It was nice to see McConaguhey play another serious role after almost throwing away his talent on terrible romantic comedies (as opposed to the few decent ones, like ""The Notebook""). Speaking of careers ruined by their good looks, Jennifer Garner doesn't suck in this movie. She is adequate as Dr. Saks and she doesn't sleep with the main character in this movie. Congreatulations. Perhaps these two handsome stars can do some serious drama or better written more complicated romantic movies. That would be good for us all. <br/><br/>Rating: Pay full price, see it twice. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"
"ramair350","10","6","10","14 December 2013"," Outstanding - truly Oscar material - both acting and story
","This is an exceptional film in all respects. I was amazed to learn that the movie is indeed based on a true story, and fortunately there was not a significant degree of artistic license used for the film.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey is amazing in the lead role, and Jared Leto delivers an equally powerful performance in a supporting role. Both of these gentlemen absolutely should receive Oscar nods.<br/><br/>The overall style is artistic but not overly so. The movie has the independent and organic feel gained from location shoots, as opposed to a corporate-focus-group-baked studio.<br/><br/>A film that gets a 10 from me must be moving, entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking. Dallas Buyer's Club delivers on all counts. 10!"
"farron34","9","6","10","24 November 2013"," Great film!
","A very well made biopic of sorts about Ron Woodroof. The story features strong personalities, which make for great characters, who were very well developed. The story neatly encompassed the life of Woodroof along with the creation and evolution of the Dallas Buyers Club; touching on the legal complications as well as the social stigma included with such an organization. <br/><br/>Cinematically, the camera work was done well, and I liked the way it was edited. I thought the music worked well, as in it wasn't very noticeable – therefore unable to illicit an emotional reaction. I thought the direction was solid, and in turn, prompted stunning performances by both McConaughey and Leto. If McConaughey isn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance here, I will be surprised. Overall a nicely executed and historically significant drama. <br/><br/>Be sure to check out my film review blog (http://farronfilms.wordpress.com) for hundreds more reviews!"
"blanbrn","10","6","10","23 November 2013"," Blunt and entertaining real life raw story of one man's fight to live!
","Matthew McConaughey really is starting to do wonderful work in film and this is very clear with his performance of Ron Woodroof, a role that was meant for Matthew as he makes this real life Texas cowboy seem so real. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is one emotional, raw and tragic film that shows a viewer that sometimes a person must take matters into their own hands. As for one Ron Woodroof it was a matter of life and death. Set in 1985 at the early start of the AIDS dawn in Texas near Dallas Ron Woodroof(Matthew McConaughey)is a hard living ""Jack Daniels"" drinking and drug snorting partying type who loves having casual sex on the side with wild women when he's not being a bull rider or working as an electrician. And after upon discovery that he has HIV and told he has 30 days to live, it's then that Ron starts a plan. You guessed it Woodroof can't get the expensive AZT drug in America and many other drugs he's heard about the American FDA won't approve so it's now time for some globe trotting from Mexico to Japan to get and transport some non approved drugs for himself and many other AIDS patients back to the United States! Ron even starts his own business calling it the ""Dallas Buyers Club""! As Ron is fighting more and more to prevent getting full blown AIDS. In a beautiful and raw supporting role is the help that Ron gets from an AIDS patient and AZT user named Rayon a bisexual hooker and strong drug user(in Jared Leto's best ever role!) Thru it all Woodroof fights the establishment to the fullest he's clearly not a yes man! This film showed that one man's voice was for the fight to live and the freedom to medicate and experiment with the will to live, I'm glad ""The Dallas Buyers Club"" showcased one great antihero in Ron Woodroof."
"Robert_duder","9","5","8","17 December 2013"," A fascinating story punctuated with potentially the two best performances of the year
","Dallas Buyers Club is a fascinating, really well made film. It deserves the solid 9 I am giving it. It was entertaining, educational, based on a true story and the characters are just really captivating. Unlike most films there aren't really any ""heroes"" in the movie, these characters are very real and very much victims of circumstance in many ways. The film is a critics dream but they wouldn't be wrong this time because this is a powerful story and the film also gives us not one but two of the best performances of the year and two of the best I have ever seen but we will get to that. I do find it interesting that many of the write ups and implications of our main character Ron Woodroof is that he helped AIDS patients get medication they need. That is true to an extent but he was also (if the movie shows the truth) self-serving. He wouldn't let anyone take the drugs without being paid first. Still he became a hero by circumstance and he makes for one incredibly fascinating larger than life character to watch. I don't necessarily think the film is any great amazing feat of movie making but it is a powerful story and the director owes all the success to an incredible cast.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey has had a diverse career between mainstream and critics choice type films. He has proved himself again and again in things like A Time To Kill and even this year's Mud. However, this is almost certainly his best performance. Even ignoring the fact that he emaciated himself to look the part, he is mesmerizing as the awful, bigoted and dying Ron Woodroof. He actually manages to make a man who is sort of horrible likable or at least you relate to him. In my opinion out of all the great roles this year, he deserves the Best Actor Oscar period. That's not even to say he's the best performance of the year, nor is he the best in this film. The best performance I have personally seen all year is by the incredible Jared Leto who unequivocally gives the performance of his lifetime. He is unbelievable as a pre-op transsexual. But that isn't even the beginning of the depth of his character Rayon. He's a drug addict, he's been outcast from his family, he is struggling to survive and to find a place in the world. Leto is a huge ten in his performance. He would be supporting actor and if he doesn't get that Oscar...its a complete travesty. The relationship between Woodroof and Rayon is incredible and from the moment they meet, the bond they forge is bizarre and yet so charismatic and heart breaking. Poor Jennifer Garner who is decent in the film is buried in the shadow of these two men in their role. Garner is decent but certainly doesn't stand out. Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Kevin Rankin and Michael O'Neill were also particularly good in their supporting roles of various sizes.<br/><br/>This is the only film I have seen from Jean-Marc Vallee and I don't mind to imply he isn't a good director. I just think the actual film making aspect of the movie was good but not amazing. This film is amazing because of the two lead performances that are beyond stunning. They make a 7.5 or maybe an 8 movie into an easy 9. Obviously the film's content is a little heavy and set appropriately in the mid-80's but the time frame doesn't hit you in an obvious way. It simply is when it is and the 80's era doesn't overshadow the point of the film but yet is vital in understanding the fear of the AIDS virus, homosexuality and the life of someone like Rayon. A powerful film that must be seen and I hope gets a lot of attention at least for its stars. It might not be something I'd watch again and again but it was still one of the best movies of the year. 9/10"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","5","8","12 December 2013"," Wonderful Performances in a Real Human Story
","Dallas Buyers Club (2013) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Rather remarkable story of Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a homophobic Texas man who learns that he's got AIDS and the doctors are only giving him a month to live. In a frantic search for drugs to treat the disease, Woodroof ends up starting a business by importing drugs that could possibly help those dying. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB isn't exactly a very cheerful movie to watch but there's no question that it's one of the year's very best movies and that it contains two of the most memorable performances of the past several decades. I'm not going to hold back the praise for McConaughey or Jared Leto who plays a cross dresser who is also dying of AIDS. We'll start off with Leto but there wasn't a single second in the film where you didn't believe him as this character. The scenes of his struggling with his drug addiction. The amount of emotions he's able to bring out of this character is quite remarkable to watch. Jennifer Garner, Steve Zahn and Kevin Rankin are also very effective in their small roles as is the barely recognizable Griffin Dunne. As for McConaughey, it's rather amazing to see how far he's came as an actor and it just goes to show what an amazing talent he is. Once he got away from those dreadful ""blockbuster"" pictures he's proved himself to be one of the greatest actors working and he offers up perhaps his finest performance. Obviously the first thing you're going to notice is the amazing weight loss that he put himself through and visually this lets the viewer know how sick he is. We get to feel how sick he is through the performance, which is just incredible to watch. This guy really isn't a likable character as he does and says some horrible things but he is a human and this is what the actor really brings out. The film itself certainly contains a message about the FDA and how things were done back in the day. Thankfully the film never preaches nor does it go for cheap, ""Oscar-bait"" moments. Instead we're given a real story with real humans and director Jean-Marc Vallee does a remarkable job at bringing it to the screen with such emotion. The film has a tremendous look to it and there's no question that it has a big heart to go with everything."
"AaronWidera","9","5","8","29 November 2013"," Absorbing tale
","Although Matthew McConaughey has done a lot of crap films, I usually do enjoy seeing him in good films. I enjoyed his performances in Mud, The Lincoln Lawyer, and of course Dazed and Confused, among others. But as good as he was in those films, he still never completely disappeared into those roles. This is not necessarily his fault all the time; he just exudes a lot of his personality naturally.<br/><br/>Although Mud came close, this is the first film for me where MM disappeared and the character of Ron Woodroof came alive. It's more than just the actor becoming skinny; from the opening scene, you can feel his sickness. Both MM and Jared Leto are never over the top in the ""Hey Look at Me, I lost a bunch of weight so I could get an Oscar nomination"" way that some other actors have been in other films requiring massive weight loss.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is most successful in the beginning, when it recreates vividly how really frightening and stigmatizing the AIDS epidemic was early on. Woodroof fights against both external and internal prejudices, and then takes on the fight against the FDA. The second half still holds up well against the first half, as the viewer is completely absorbed in Woodroof et al's plight and fight for survival.<br/><br/>One criticism of the film I've read is that Woodroof goes from homophobic to accepting his homosexual business partner and customers rather easily. I don't find this to be a valid criticism. For one thing the film covers a long period of time, with gaps of time between one scene and the next. Secondly, the film is not about Woodroof's transformation from bigot to tolerant human being. It is about struggling to survive in the face of disease and a heartless bureaucracy that gets in the way of his survival. It is thru the process of this struggle that he realizes that he and those around him are all part of the same struggle.<br/><br/>The ending of the film should not be a surprise, but the director ended it perfectly, without undue sentimentality. Definitely one of the better films of this year."
"robkillian","1","17","38","7 June 2014"," Offensive and Cliché'd
","This false and inauthentic film lifts up a straight, white, dishonest 'victim' of AIDS in a story designed to remind us of the overwhelming tragedy of AIDS in an era unfortunately not forgotten. This cliché'd film is not in any way truthful to the time or to those whose deaths it was meant to commemorate. This film is not truthful in any manner as to the characters it uses to tell this inauthentic story. Medicine is portrayed inaccurately. Gay characters are not portrayed accurately. Nurses and Government bureaucrats are not shown in any way accurately. I cannot for one minute understand how this film got to be distributed or held up for the whole world to see. Here we have a straight man who is infecting dozens of unknowing women with porn like sex throughout this movie and we have the 'gay' character floating through the movie in a dress and acting fey without even a kiss or a touch or a glance of sexuality. We have medicine, in an era where thousands of health care professionals gave their all to try to save those infected with AIDS, as greedy money hungry uncaring 'assholes'. Buyers clubs sprung up in many cities around the U.S. and other places. Hundreds, if not thousands of doctors and other health care professionals put their careers and licenses on the line to 'write scripts' to stock the shelves of these buyer's clubs. But, not in this move. Fake. Bad, Cliché'd and not worth the time it took to write this review. Don't waste your time on this horrible movie."

","Focusing on the AIDS epidemic of the 80's, this movie faces a thematic giant head-on and does a damn good job doing so. I can't praise Matthew McConaughey's performance enough in this. Good lord, he demands every ounce of your attention for every moment he's on screen. His physical transformation (along with Jared Leto's) is astonishing. The writing is impeccable. The cinematography very pleasantly surprised me. An aesthetically pleasing film at most times with so many great shots and excellent camera work. Captivating editing that really ties the film together, moves the story along at an admirable pace, and highly effectively kept me as the viewer enthusiastically along for the entirety of the ride. An incredible story told on screen with immaculate artistic direction, driven by absolutely killer performances.<br/><br/>""Sorry lady, but I prefer to die with my boots on."""
"samfischer88","10","3","4","18 February 2016"," Great Portrayal of a Difficult Topic
","I saw this about two weeks after the Oscars, so I was well aware of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's fantastic performances. I honestly wasn't expecting them to be that brilliant though. Between those two, there hasn't been a movie that included such transformations before. These characters were written perfectly to fit the story, and the actors did a great job in the portrayals. The characters were honestly not very likable at times, but the view cares for them. Their struggle is real and the viewers stay on their side, hoping for it all to work out in some way. <br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is set in the 1970s and 80s, as Ron Woodroof lives through the height of the HIV scare. Everyone had negative stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. DBC shows us what people living with the disease had to go through at the time and how much pain they had survived. <br/><br/>The story is dark and hard to watch at times, especially as the people with HIV/AIDS saw their health deteriorate. The realism is outstanding. The story shows all sides of their lives. Woodroof obviously had he biggest transformation as he goes from a judgmental redneck of sorts to truly identifying with the people he once hated. The story is transforming and eye opening. <br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that you should see. In my opinion, Dallas Buyers Club has one of the best if not the best combination of actors ever. McConaughey and Leto transformed themselves into unrecognizable characters, which was a treat. When you add those two performances to the fantastic story at hand, you will end up with an excellent movie. Thats what Dallas Buyers Club did, and it is worth a watch; 8/10"
"gulherme","10","3","4","10 February 2016"," A movie with social argument to save life in all world
","Dallas Buyer Club is a movie about what a man can do to survive, it can be obvious, but this film shows how bureaucracy can cost thousands of life when misused. Although the name suggest it isn't a movie about consumerism, this is about a man fighting for his life, a right clearly expressed in the Bill of Right and the U.S. Constitution. Beside the ignorance of few doctors and they distance from patient's life.<br/><br/>Dallas is how to use the system against the system, the American health care system is expensive, mixed from public and private organization and don't have a universal insurance. One of the main arguments is a drug can't be sell without testing, and the Food and Drugs Administration is really slow to analyze new drugs that it can be too late for some patients.<br/><br/>The fact people aren't fighting for they life change the ethical question behind why some people need to create organizations to tried save their lives. To properly evaluate this argument, use drugs without permission, we need to know how the system block a person to have access to use things can save they life.<br/><br/>Is unequivocal the Leto acting is amazing, and he won his Oscar. I strong recommend this movie to watch and think about our health system and what we can make to improve our heart."
"anuj-56868","8","3","4","23 January 2016"," All it takes is will
","As everyone else must have mentioned first things first. Each character portrayed their role to perfection that is why this movie has got so good reputation.<br/><br/>Now I will talk about my point of view. The thing i liked the most was the will to stay alive by Ron Woodroof and his willingness to help others. The transformation from being some one who does not gives a damn to the one who cares about each and everyone around him is the real thing. Not everyone can transform like Ron Woodroof did in his real life and Matthew McConaughey in its reel counterpart. Matthew McConaughey perfectly demonstrated the pain what Ron Woodroof might have gone through. He really showed the willing to have more of life whatever he can get. The urge each and every dying person has. In my opinion the everyone ""dying or not"" should have a will to do something that is what they all might be lacking if they are not succeeding."
"photographyscotland-969-933420","8","3","4","22 August 2015"," Really Enjoyed This!
","I was surprised that this film missed out on Best Picture because it for me it beat anything else that year in terms of substance, intensity and creativity.<br/><br/>Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor winners here were well deserved, but I think Best Picture would've been justified. I thought Jared Leto's portrayal of the transvestite was amazing, so convincing in terms of fragility and the frustration of being a woman in a man's body, in addition to all the little quirks of mannerism exhibited by effeminate men.<br/><br/>There is so much in this film for the budding film student to consider, it's an absolute treasure of essay worthy material. The single most important topic in the film for me is a man's right to choose alternative medicine as a legitimate treatment for disease, in this case the focus was AIDS, but could also be seen in the context of cancer or anything else. <br/><br/>The ethics of big pharma is covered which is held in contrast to the ethics of the individual entrepreneur played brilliantly here by Matthew McConaughey. While the activities of big pharma are protected by law, the corruptive profit motive at the core of American industry is suggested in the film to be at odds with the public's best interests when McConaughey's entrepreneurial character offers a homeopathic alternative which appears to work. The authorities try everything in the book to put him out of business but the entrepreneurial spirit at the heart of his American Dream to challenge the pharmaceutical industry establishment refuses to concede defeat.<br/><br/>There is a sting in the tail however and I wont mention it here because it is a spoiler for those yet to see this movie. There is a lot more to this movie which includes bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, class struggle, to name but a few of society's least attractive characteristics. Dallas Buyer's Club is a huge dose of gritty realism we haven't seen for quite a while and a true story it appears. Go see it!"

Both Matthew & Jared deserve all the accolades received for their full on efforts in making this film. Jennifer Garner played her part to a T seamlessly however not Oscar nomination worthy performance. She was already outshone by Matthew & Jared. As one reviewer already posted...they forgot that they were watching actors & not an actual reality/documentary film. What more can anyone expect from a film/actor than to portray their roles as true to life as possible. Such sad but amazingly well put together film. Well done all involved!"

","There are some films you watch for entertainment, and others you watch for a deeper meaning. Dallas Buyers Club is definitely one of the latter. Its themes range from survival to corruption to cooperation. The story, while a little raucous, shows how humans have an instinct to survive at all costs. It also shows how money trumps all, especially in the United States and how people who would normally think badly of each other can be driven together by corruption and survival to do what is right and do it selflessly. <br/><br/>The acting is also very impressive among the leads. Matthew McConaughey gives the best performance of his career as Ron Woodroof. His tenacity and boldness carry the film almost single-handedly. Jared Leto alleviates some of the burden, as does Jennifer Garner. Both do stellar jobs in their supporting roles. The rest of the cast adds very little to the film; however, they do not detract either, shifting the focus onto the leads. <br/><br/>The overall look of the film strives for realism. The cinematography is a little too shaky at times; however, it mostly adds to the film, breaking down a barrier between the actors on-screen and the audience. Overall, Dallas Buyers Club is not for the faint of heart. However, it is an emotionally rewarding film that will please almost all of its viewers."
"never_relent","9","3","4","4 March 2014"," The Movie is about living
","The movie is not quite about AIDS, the much it is about coldness and meaninglessness. I reached the multiplex some 10 minutes after the movie had begun, but the drift of story and the direction is too easy to grasp, and yet so abominable. Matthew is an electrician. The recklessness in his life has a reason he has learned to care for none as a gesture in return to his upbringing. By the end, he does talk about his memories of being a kid, of having a father of being taken care of. Then all those experiences which began as a thrill in the evenings and pretended as sense of freedom slyly and slowly had become addictions and only way to keep the brain from wondering what went wrong, why his life was the way it was. He became so mellow with being that insanely drunk guy in the blinding mist of cocaine and screams, moans of whores and random girls. Movie does not have any noticeable music I can imagine the horror of musicians though. He's not a bad guy at all it's just who he is—callous and kind of rejecting and condescending. But somehow this is how men seem to be normal where he lives. Then one day while trying to save a guy from being amputated at the rail-yard where he works, he gets shocked and passes out. He wakes up in a local hospital and blood-tests turn out to bear a news, a dead-end to his horror—they confirm that he is HIV positive. Was it whores, was it queers, was it recklessness? So, he's admitted and right next to his bed is this biological boy who feels like a girl—Jared. Matthew is homophobic not by heart but by trend. His homophobia is like their love for MTv top 40. But Jared is a very loving girl inside a guy's body. They play cards and Matthew(character's name Ron) loses. He is there after having tried to lose the sight of this HIV+ thing too in cocaine, liquor and whores. But he had to, for probably first time, accept that this one is different. A drug company comes up with a new drug AZT which is up for a test for 1 year and having done a lot of research on his part, Ron tries to get his hand on AZT by bribing a Mexican ward-boy. He was given only 30 days of life according to Doctors when first diagnosed positive for the virus. On 30th day, he goes to Mexico and gets those drugs which are legal everywhere else except in U(FDA just won't approve of 'em for some unspecified reasons which make it seem like a programmed fork of drug companies). He lives to see the 32st day. He keeps on getting those drugs and succeeds in convincing the custom department that it all is for his personal use. All along, he has to experience rejection from his friends who have begun to believe that probably Ron has been sleeping with homosexual guys(71% of international HIV + cases were associated with gay sex relations). It was shattering, but Ron had already grown up in Antarctica of human compassion—Dallas, Texas.<br/><br/>Matthew dies 7 years after being diagnosed HIV+. He lived the most after the news of HIV+ blood in his veins.<br/><br/>The fact that movie bears all along the reel time is that there is loneliness no matter how much sweetness Hollywood and POP songs and Ads and sitcoms and popular fiction and all coat the reality with, there are guys who go to bed alone wondering what went wrong and how feeling sad for oneself is gay. And this is what the film is about, the coldness because we expect a happy end, a lovely glossy life like walmart outlets and richness. People try to find passion, they trick themselves into thinking that probably if they get rich, their lives will get better they try to escape accepting that it is all illusion. It's just love which men seek to give and feel. Jared happens to play this thing in his character and he did a splendid job."

","Dallas Buyers Club throws you straight into the deep end, with no floats. They don't dance around the facts, and reality hits you hard. Matthew McConaughey slims down to an incredible size for this role and plays his part with huge conviction. The story tells of a man who goes to hospital for a work related injury, to be told he has HIV. Doctors tell him he has 30 days to live, but in denial takes no notice of the warning. Finally, he comes around to his disease and finds AZT is the only drug that can prolong his life, he goes in search for it it Mexico. Jared Leto plays an amazing supporting role, as a Transgender patient also with HIV. Fantastic direction, but will definitely not be appreciated for its full potential by some, because of the nature of the film."
"Kicino","8","3","4","25 February 2014"," A Marginal Man's Transformation Brings Hopes to Humanity
","It is a great movie. I thought Leonardo DeCaprio would win the Oscar before I saw this but now I am not so sure. Matthew McConaughey is so convincing in transforming himself into an AIDS patient who never quits fighting for his own life. He even walks like such an unlikeable character: a swaggering womanizing drug user who works as an electrician. His stares, snarls, swears, and care are all so impressive. <br/><br/>Based on a true story, The Dallas Buyers Club tells us how Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), after being diagnosed of AIDS in 1985 and only had 30 days to live, refused to wait to die but chose to fight head on with the disease, the medical community and government bureaucracy to obtain/smuggle pharmaceutical drugs that worked for him and other patients like him. <br/><br/>What I like about the movie is the spirit Ron Woodroof represents: he never quits and he never takes no as an answer. He is smarter than he looks. Initially denying his condition, he researches into AIDS, how people got it and what is being used to treat the disease. He lives around the system to survive on the edges. But he is not just surviving. <br/><br/>By the end of the movie he has transcended his battle for mere existence/surviving into selflessly helping those in desperate need as he is. There is a sense of admirable quality in him despite his promiscuity and abuses in drugs. Countering the plight of his rapidly diminishing life amid an incurable disease has overshadowed his homophobia and the chase for monetary reward. His desperation has driven him to work around, inside and outside the system, thus challenging the inflexibility of law and bureaucracy. <br/><br/>Ron is a gambler throughout the movie, from hustling bets on the rodeos, to trafficking unapproved drugs from Mexico and bribing officials and professional to get what he wants, to setting up a group to supply unapproved but workable drugs to patients who need them. He has tremendous confidence and uses whatever works to get what he wants. All through his life, he energetically grips very tight control on his life, just as he holds tight onto the rodeo.<br/><br/>This is essentially a story of the marginal people. Ron and his transsexual partner Rayon (Jared Leto), together with the Dallas Club Buyers members, mostly gay, were shunned by society in the mid-80s when AIDS was first discovered. Being diagnosed with AIDS with limited knowledge on its association with the gay community and few effective medicine available, they were never taken seriously by the mainstream society even though their lives were threatened. Yet, through Ron and the hard work of his club, we can see a respect for humanity regardless of people's lifestyle and sexual orientation. <br/><br/>While the real Ron's sexual orientation is unclear (perhaps for marketing reasons and dramatic effect, Ron is portrayed in the film as strictly straight and even flirts with his doctor), the film portrays a natural yet convincing shift of an angry, redneck homophobic into a diligent researcher/experimenter who put his own life on the table. <br/><br/>Spotting a chance to make money, he begins to work closely with the gay community. As their deterioration slow down he feels more confident of his own way of combating the disease. Yet when his partner eventually dies, either from the toxic new medicine or his own abuse in drugs, Ron realizes that death is the final equalizer therefore even financial difficulties of the club is not a problem anymore. At this juncture, we can see, and as Ron tells us, he does not merely want to live, but also leave a legacy during the limited time he has on earth. For that it is admirable. <br/><br/>Excellent performance of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto who shed 47 and 30 pounds respectively for their roles. Bravo to the journalist who interviewed the real Ron Woodroof a few weeks before he died which inspired producers to make this movie. Hats off to the producers and script writers who turned such a depressing and misunderstood matter into an encouraging crusade of humankind. <br/><br/>If we believe life is beautiful, then law, bureaucracy, business, and medical research should put human's wellbeing in the utmost priority. Our protagonist has vividly demonstrated this. Must see."

I must confess that a whistle of disbelief escaped me when I saw that he won the Golden Globe, and not in the ""Musical or comedy"" category! But I should know better. Even when I didn't watch ""Mud"" (2012) (which I intended to do but just couldn't make the time), I remember reading about how he has served notice that he has come a long way from the pretty face with enviable biceps in ""Sahara"" (2005). ""Dallas Buyers Club"" cements this transformation, with not only the aforementioned win, but also Critics' Choice. Oscar is 5 days away, and the world is holding its breath.<br/><br/>The true story of Ron Woodroof in the 80s inspired this movie which strives on several favorite elements for makers of motion pictures. The story is about how Woodroof, diagnosis with H.I.V. and a month to live, persevered for another seven years during which he helped hundreds of fellow patients via the ingenuous titular vehicle through which he distributed drugs (supplemented by health products) technically not legally marketable, but ironically already FDA approved.<br/><br/>Of the drama-generating ""elements"" alluded to above, the most significant is the well-proved David-Goliath scenario: underdog vs big power. Against the self-interest of governing bodies (FDA leading the pack which includes IRA, Customs and Immigration etc) and big business, Woodroof struggles to get these ""prohibited"" drugs into the country for distribution to people whose life depend on them. While homosexuality is not really a key subject matter for this movie, whenever A.I.D. is involved, it inevitably becomes an issue, particularly in the 80s. And then, there is this also a familiar ""odd couple"" situation involving Woodroof and his business partner, a sensitive, vulnerable transvestite brilliantly portrayed by Jared Leto who, just like McConaughey, is on his way to Oscar showdown carrying the double honor of Golden Globe and Critics' Choice wins. The fact that Woodroof starts out as an out-and-out redneck and homophobic makes this unlikely development of business partnership particularly intriguing, and ultimately friendship that much more poignant.<br/><br/>While this movie has its share of sex scenes, particularly in the beginning when Woodroof is a pleasure-seeking rodeo cowboy, there is only the faintest hint of romance, if at all, between our protagonist transformed and a sympathetic doctor portrayed capably by Jennifer Garner."
"Diddisnap","10","3","4","22 February 2014"," Overrated ? Not in the Least !
","Fantastic and moving story. Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Garner gave their best performances to date in my opinion. The movie does open your eyes to the realities of how pharmaceutical companies take full advantage of people here in the states. For those who were not around in the early 80's or at least at an age of understanding of when the Aids epidemic really became public. This movie is a good example of how things were in the beginning and the fight it took for the victims of this disease to stay alive, especially the victims who could not afford proper treatment. In the early 80's, the majority of people died and there really wasn't any hope. We have come a long way since then. This movie is a fight for survival but it doesn't get too serious, there are many funny moments as well."

","Aids, Dallas Buyers Club, Drug Treatment, Film Review, HIV, Homophobia, Jared Leto, Jean-Marc Vallee, Jennifer Garner, Mattew McConaughey, Movie Review, Pharmaceutical Industry, Rodeo, Ron Woodroof<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club – 15/02/2014 @ The Watershed, Bristol.<br/><br/>February 17, 2014 <br/><br/>Apparently that chest beating chant which Matthew McConaughey teaches Leonardo Di Caprio in the film 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is based on his real life warm up rituals which take place before a scene. If it produces performances like this, it is definitely something he should keep up as his performance as Ron Woodroof is incredible. Through physical transformation and commitment to his character, he really embodies the role, making the character believable and increasingly likable as the film goes on.<br/><br/>Ron Woodroof is the hard drinking, fast living, macho redneck who possesses racist and homophobic views. He is a rodeo bull rider who enjoys what this lifestyle brings to him, casual sex and drugs & alcohol. His macho existence is majorly interrupted when he is hospitalised due to a work related injury and is subsequently diagnosed with HIV after routine blood tests. Initially, Woodroof is in a stage of disbelief as he believes HIV is a disease which 'fa**ots' get, but after some research, realises anyone can catch it. There is a drug called ACT which is on a trial run to treat HIV, but when Woodroof refuses the treatment because it is doing nothing for him, he sets out to find alternative, non toxic treatments to prove to help himself and others who are suffering from this disease. He enlists the help of a transvestite who is also diagnosed with HIV named Rayon (Jared Leto) as she has many contacts in the gay community. Together, they help many victims and make a lot of money with their scheme which exploits a legal loophole.<br/><br/>The films main strength is the gradual change of Woodroof's character, from macho, homophobic redneck to more accepting and caring individual. While he is not perfect and his way of helping people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS is not entirely ethical (he only helps people who can afford his asking price) it is still a marked improvement. He goes on further and takes on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claiming that they are not doing their job properly and that they are short sighted with their funding of the apparently ineffective ACT treatment. It is a believable transformation which does not yield to cliché Hollywood sentimentality. This is testament to Matthew McConaughey's acting, as well as the fact he lost 3 stone for the role. He may win the Oscar for Best Male Performance in my opinion. Jared Leto also gives an excellent performance as I feel he works just as hard as Matthew McConaughey in terms of physical transformation. Also Jennifer Garner, although out-shined by the aforementioned performances is also good as Dr Eve Saks, a Doctor who sympathises with Woodroof's mission.<br/><br/>The film making itself may be a little scrappy at times, but with it's balance of humour, drama and sadness, it is a watchable and effective film with strong performances and a thought provoking subject matter which leaves you questioning the motives of the pharmaceutical industry.<br/><br/>Check out my film review blog - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com"
"antagonist117","10","3","4","15 February 2014"," A deeply empathetic movie about the messy early responses to the AIDS crisis
","At the start of the AIDS crisis people knew little about the disease except that it was a virtual death sentence and that it seemed to be selectively affecting homosexuals and drug users. Doctors didn't know how to treat it, governments were slow to react, and large parts of society reacted by blaming the victims, and shunning them, instead of showing empathy. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a movie about empathy, set at this uncertain, pivotal moment in American history. Most movies are exercises in empathy, even when they don't mean to be, because they ask us to view stories from perspectives other than our own; this is one of the great strengths of the cinematic art form and one of the best proofs of its value. In ""Dallas Buyers Club"" the main character, a homophobic coke-head electrician and bullrider who lives in a trailer park (Matthew McConaughey), is the person we accompany through the early part of the AIDS saga. It is hard to imagine anyone coming to the end of the movie without respecting him, feeling for him, and liking him, even though few of the people who seek out a movie about the AIDS crisis are likely to be in sympathy with the hateful slurs or the self-destructive lifestyle that define him at the story's beginning. The movie is about his own journey toward empathy as well, and it is fascinating to notice how his unique perspective colors that journey and defines its limits.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable consequences of the early AIDS era, and a recurring theme in the memoirs and narratives that have come out of that experience, was that many HIV-positive individuals took it upon themselves to become self-taught experts on the medicinal, scientific, financial, and legal issues surrounding their diagnosis. When hospitals and the FDA and the general public seemed helpless at best and apathetic at worse, communities emerged among those most affected that provided conduits for information and support, and in some cases used other-than- legal means to give desperate members access to untested, unapproved treatments. In this film, the titular Dallas Buyers Club is one such community. Its singleminded, brash, charismatic, lying, stealing, drinking, politically-incorrect leader is the Robin Hood of a ragtag band of individuals whose perspectives he does not share and cannot quite understand, but to whom he is intimately tied by a shared medical fate. The other person we, and he, know best is a transgendered and usually-stoned free spirit from the club scene named Rayon (Jared Leto), but there are glimpses of people from other walks of life as well, from the young and broke to an older, white collar couple in a committed relationship. The perspectives of medical professionals runs a similar gamut, from an unlicensed homeopathic type south of the border to a tool of Big Pharma to a concerned but cautious doctor played by Jennifer Garner. What is sobering is the realization that although all of these people want a cure, they come to the table with such different backgrounds and ideals that fighting each other is easier than fighting AIDS. McConaughey's character, on the phone with a doctor, pleads, ""I see where you're coming from, can you see where I'm coming from?"" ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a movie about seeing where people are coming from, and a damn good one."
"fas97","10","3","4","10 February 2014"," Phenomenal performances by Matthew and Jared
","Man this movie is deep, Ron was a wreck less womanizer, Rayon was a poor drug addict which got caught up in the HIV problem. These are performances by actors which usually do not live up to the expectations. Matthew is awesome, he is so damn skinny it makes you sick to look at his physique. Jared is almost un-recognizable. What a compelling question about how the Pharmaceuticals run this country. The FDA was bought and paid for and this clearly shows their approach (bullying the alternative medical options) to protect the Pharmaceuticals. This film is well directed and enlightening to the human spirit it portrays in Ron."
"A_Voice","6","3","4","3 February 2014"," An ordinary story with some extraordinary performances.
","If not years best film, it certainly had years' best performances, namely Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. The story however, at least for me seemed a little far fetched and clichéd at times.<br/><br/>Ron, a rodeo is diagnosed with HIV. In order to live longer, he tries every possible medicine he can come across. When he finds few non-approved medicines to be effective in keeping him alive, he plans to make money through those. But in turn ends up helping numerous AIDS patients across Dallas.<br/><br/>I had certain problems with the films, like it was a little cause of concern for me as to why he never ran out on his stock of medicines even if he was raided by the FDA (I might have missed something!). Also, the way he gets those medicines so easily smuggled inside the US is suspicious.<br/><br/>Barring the problems there were a ton of pros of this feature. First the characters: The characters of DCB are so strongly penned the they end up sticking with you, especially Jared Leto's character. It might even change homophobics' perspective of transsexual and homosexuals, just like it did for Ron. While Ron may not be the typical happy go lucky type of AIDS character, he certainly is a memorable one. You might feel bad for Ron but at the same time you will hate him for his mannerism and behavior. You might acknowledge and understand his will to live, but at the same you will question his methods. In short, Ron does not need your empathy, he is far too great for that.<br/><br/>The film breaks the traditional 'trust your doctor' approach of patients, specifically those who are sure of their impending death. It inspires us to fight and live, in a way we haven't seen before. Of all the AIDS movies we see, there is just one message, ""life is short, live it to the fullest"". But DCB not only gives this message but also has a new and a more prominent one ""Dare to live"". Live your life to the fullest and live long, whatever it takes.<br/><br/>Direction: Jean-Marc Vallée manages to have a strong hold on the characters as well as the story, he is precise and shows us what we need to see, but not what we want.<br/><br/>Script/Story: Excellently written with some memorable characters.<br/><br/>Acting: Matthew McConaughey easily gives the best performance this year. He certainly will give Chiwetel Ejiofor a run for his money at the academy awards. I won't be surprise if it ends up with a tie. Jared Leto, the actor turned singer is easily mistaken as a singer turned actor, if you know what I mean. Probably the best and most heart wrenching performance in his career. An Oscar is a surety. Jennifer Garner and others are convincing.<br/><br/>Music: The score was average, but well executed, given the small budget.<br/><br/>Overall a nice and a different film. Not the traditional AIDS film, memorable nevertheless."
"The_Film_Cricket","8","3","4","14 November 2013"," Matthew McConaughey reminds us why he became a movie star in the first place.
","""The Dallas Buyers Club"" opens with a scene that doesn't mean much at first. We are at a rodeo; bull and rider are let out of the pen. The bull flails around in the ring while the rider holds on for dear life. Elsewhere, overlooking the proceedings, are a man and a woman in shadow engaged in what can only be referred to as mercenary sex. Later when that man is declared HIV positive it becomes clear that it is he, not the bull rider, who is really playing a dangerous game.<br/><br/>The man is Ron Woodroof, a real-life rodeo stud and electrician who was diagnosed in 1985 with HIV and, after a period of denial, engaged his skills as a hustler to extend his life seven years after being diagnosed with only 30 days to live. How Ron got the disease is pretty easy to figure out. He lives a life of excess that would have made Henry VIII blush. He's not a nice guy. He's a party animal with a cocaine habit, who guzzles booze and chases skirts with such ferocity that it almost seems exaggerated. Like his buddies at the rodeo, Ron is a hard-headed homophobic, a misogynistic louse whose response to the news that he is HIV positive with ""I ain't no faggot."" He tells his doctor to shove it before storming out of the hospital. Looking at his gaunt, skinny frame and pallid skin we are left to wonder why Ron didn't figure out something was wrong sooner.<br/><br/>The news that he is suffering from a ""gay disease"" hits him hard. Newspapers have just announced the death of Rock Hudson and it pushes his fellow homophobes away. Yet, he's not satisfied to lay down and die. He begins doing research and tries to get his hands on AZT, the only FDA treatment available at the time. Wading through a network of health officials whose only response is ""No . . . I'm really sorry,"" he determines to get some kind of help. From here it is difficult to discuss important plot points without spoilers. So, be warned.<br/><br/>Ron is spurred into action that not only extends his life but also helps a lot of other people in the process. He discovers an American doctor in Mexico (a barely recognizable Griffin Dunne) who is willing to sell him the medication that he can then smuggle back across the border. In an effort to skirt legal issues, he develops The Dallas Buyers Club, a club in which fellow AIDS patients pay him a $400 annual club fee and get their drugs for free. He even makes friends with a pre-op transsexual named Rayon who has the disease himself and becomes Ron's connection into gay clients. Ron's tepid friendship with Rayon doesn't crack his homophobia, but it pushes him into a mode of respect that never feels phony. There is a mutual respect that develops that is touching even while it can't necessarily be called a friendship.<br/><br/>Ron's story is told through a brilliant performance by Matthew McConaughey, whose days as a rom-com himbo seem to be safely behind him after two years of wonderful work in ""Killer Joe"", ""Magic Mike"", and ""Mud"". This is the single best performance of his career, a brave virtuoso piece of acting that reminds us why he became a movie star in the first place. McConaughey lost 38 pounds to play this role and his appearance is striking. We're use to the handsome, tanned actor with the Adonis-physique, but here he has shed all that. Ron is rail-thin with sunken facial features and bad skin. We're reminded of many of the young men who succumb to the disease early on – healthy men with youthful eyes staring out of a frame that was slowly withering away. Yet, McConaughey's physical transformation is only part of what makes his performance work. He isn't afraid to play Ron as a cantankerous jerk. Our sympathy comes from his transformation from self-involved louse, to a man determined to help other AIDS patients who are being written off as ""the living dead."" The other great performance in the film comes from Jared Leto as Rayon, a sarcastic pre-op transsexual who becomes Ron's liaison to find gay patients for the club. Rayon is gay but he's not over-the-top. There's a sensitive heart beating beneath is transgender apparel and his approach to Ron is very touching. The two man have a mutual need but it isn't in a formula way. It is a form of respect that doesn't quite tip over into friendship. Leto has always been an understated actor and here he turns in his finest performance. He deserves and Oscar nomination next spring.<br/><br/>You only wish that the rest of the movie were so original. The movie gets into the by-the-number elements of the plot and dispenses them often with underdeveloped characters and predictable drama. Jennifer Garner has a criminally underwritten role as a doctor who is by Ron's side when he first gets the bad news but later comes to have sympathy with what he is trying to do. The rest of the doctors come off as cold and unfeeling, usually approaching Ron with a lot of negatives. So, you're left with two great performances in a movie whose script needed work. That's okay because it's a flawed story led by an unflawed performance by Matthew McConaughey, one that signals that this wonderful actor is at the top of his form."
"davetomkins","9","4","6","18 February 2014"," Outstanding.
","Dallas Buyers Club is not normally the sort of film I would go to watch but given all the hype it had to be worth a look. I was hooked from the start. Matthew McConaughy gives a staggeringly good performance (losing that much weight - 47lbs! - must've been difficult) whilst Jared Leto steals the show as Rayon, the unlikely business partner that Ron ends up working with.<br/><br/>It is an extremely bitter-sweet movie, and describes the despair, hope and uncertainty surrounding mid-80s AIDS patients in detail but without shoving it down your throat. What is even more impressive is the way McConaughey shows the journey that Ron Woodroof takes, from abusive, blinkered rodeo redneck to tolerant, hard-nosed businessman with more than an eye for the medical laws of his country.<br/><br/>It's an absolute triumph in my eyes; however I feel that McConaughey & Leto will be sadly overlooked at the Oscars due to the bigger budget and more popular 12 Years A Slave. That's not to say 12 Years doesn't deserve it - they both do. But I just don't think that Dallas Buyers Club will get the awards I am certain it warrants."
"EAA123","10","4","6","8 January 2014"," Oscar worthy performance
","I went into this movie blind not knowing what to expect, but it blew me away. Mathew McConaughey's performance was reminiscent of De Niro's Raging Bull performance. Mathew McConaughey lost so much weight, making himself look so awful, you really believed he had aids. Oscar worthy performance if you ask me. This movie also had the time period down. Felt like I was really back there in that time period. You could truly feel the love/hate/friendship/relationship between Jared Leto's character and Mathew McConaughey's character. You loved and hated them both at times, but you knew they were designed to help each other. Jennifer Garner's performance was heartfelt as well."

","During the early dark days of the Aids epidemic in America the powers that be took scant notice or chose to ignore the phenomena that was wiping out a certain segment of the population ( needle sharing druggies, gay men) at an appalling rate. Given the social standing of both groups in the eighties the government refused to sound the alarm bell, allowing instead for the FDA to take its time approving other drugs beyond the hard on the system AZT. Working at that time as a state health investigator in that field I encountered dozens of HIV positive individuals who claimed it made them sicker than they were and some stopped taking the med. South of the border in Mexico there were drugs proving to be more efficacious without FDA approval. Enter Ron Woodruff rodeo electrician,con man and hedonist who decided to do something about it when faced with the deadly diagnosis.<br/><br/>In The Dallas Buyers Club Matt McConaughey creates a vivid warts and all portrait of the man who refused to take no for an answer and it is by far the best performance of his career. Painfully thin and skeletal looking McConnaghy's sickly visage belies a healthy determination to fight the system's apathy in an offbeat David and Goliath struggle. By employing his con man skills to circumvent the law and distribute the unapproved meds to the infected he starts the Dallas Buyers Club out of a dubious motel by selling memberships. The DEA however does not take it lying down and it results in raids and court battles.<br/><br/>McConaughey dominates the picture as the surly pugnacious Don Quixote tilting at the government with a solid assist from Jared Leto playing his infected, drug addled transsexual Sancho Panza. As a physician and Woodruff's only ally working within the system Jennifer Garner comes across flat and dispassionate whiffing on more than one scene with McConaughey and disapproving colleagues.<br/><br/>Things lag slightly towards the end but director Jean Marc Valee states his case plainly and solidly without hysteria on this one time hot topic that has cooled considerably over the years as the disease is no longer an automatic death sentence due to advancement in meds and education. You may quibble about the size of Ron Woodruff's contribution and his unorthodox methodology but there is no denying his effort to help a desperate population in the darkest days of the disease as anything else other than courageous."
"quotey-cake","3","11","23","4 March 2014"," Important topic, but I just didn't care
","When I first heard about this film, I didn't immediately want to see it, but after assurances from friends that it was very good, I decided to give it a watch. However, I was incredibly disappointed. The overall subject of the film is of course very important and widely overlooked by the mainstream film industry, but the portrayal by McConaughey made me not care about a condition that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. I understand that a character doesn't have to be inherently likable to make a good film, but when they don't have one redeeming quality, it is hard to find any sort of compassion for them. Knowing that the story is based on true events, it could be that McConaughey is simply playing a character very well and his portrayal could be spot on, but I felt no emotion towards him other than mild disgust for the entire film. He is rude, misogynistic, sexist, homophobic, selfish and greedy, and at no point seems to actually change any of these qualities. Yes he starts selling drugs to AIDS sufferers (including gay people) but only when he can make enough for a decent profit. The only times in the film when he is decent to someone are when he gets something out of it, making for a character that I could barely watch, let alone have sympathy for.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is the film's saving grace as Rayon (all three of the stars I am giving this film are for his performance), with an incredible performance deserving of his recent Oscar for best supporting actor, but once Rayon is out of the picture, the film becomes lifeless and boring, barely worth watching to the end. <br/><br/>As a side note, the film just barely passes the Bechdel test, depending entirely on whether you count Rayon as a woman or not. As Rayon is referred to all the way through the film as ""he/him"", not just by Ron, but his long time friend Eve, it does not, and as such contains a grand total of one fully established female character - hardly a diverse or balanced cast."
"FilmMuscle","7","6","11","23 November 2013"," An Oscar-Baity Film That Takes Risks
","At this point, we seem to have a general idea of what films serve as the ""Oscar-baity"" kind- the movies that explore homosexuality, illnesses, historical events like slavery, etc. Dallas Buyer's Club appeared to be yet another example based off of the promotions and premise alone, but I'm glad that the film took some daring risks with that notion. Instead of the archetypal sympathetic protagonist the Academy tends to prefer, Matthew McConaughey portrays the typical redneck: a bigot who despises the gays (or ""faggots"" as he constantly names them) and seemingly possesses xenophobia as well, judging from his racially insulting remarks, but he ultimately ends up testing positive for HIV. On that note, I believe that this is definitely McConaughey's brightest performance in that he takes on a far different role instead of the heroic or, at least, moral characters he frequently personates. <br/><br/>Dallas Buyer's Club refuses to incorporate the predictable and generic character developments that most famed stories depict with the protagonist usually learning from his past mistakes in a- frankly- forced and unnatural manner, and that's usually the picture that many ""Oscar-baity"" films paint as the Best Actor winner plays a noticeably flawed human being who ends up loving the individuals he once spited once everything's been said and done. With this piece of cinema, McConaughey maintains fairly convincing progress throughout, never ceasing to exclaim profanity. In reality, believe it or not, there are absolutely the kinds of people that never change and persistently hold on to their prejudice or other various beliefs, no matter the advancement of certain circumstances. Even though the casual audience or corporate producers expect a stereotypical protagonist and that same ending (never once realizing that they're watching the exact same plot every single time), this instance refrains from that, but oh well, that's another conversation that'll be left to discuss later. Anyways, I respect that about the film, and I respect any film that centers on substantially flawed persons (ones who murder, hate, engage in other criminal activities, etc, etc.). So, in that regard, I totally applaud the focus on Ron Woodroof's (McConaughey's) arc. Jared Leto also delivers an exceptional performance as a transvestite who has tested positive for HIV as well, and though Leto fills in the shoes of a baity and unoriginal character that the Academy simply adore, one can't possibly ignore his captivating presence. <br/><br/>Once the credits roll, I opine that the acting department is what essentially helps the film stand out. The story, itself, exposes the incompetence of the FDA and the medicinal industry, and although it was most relevant during that time period, it rings true nowadays likewise. However, the film felt quite lengthy despite the fact that it's less than two hours long. I'm not entirely sure if it was the pacing or the repetition within the plot, but the picture clearly didn't pass me by. In sum, despite the crucial substance the film offers in the form of corruption- notice that I'm not one of the moviegoers who're easily swept by all the hype and buzz- all I will discover myself raving about, once the year has come to a close, is its superb acting."
"drjgardner","8","6","11","13 November 2013"," Great acting in a story that needed to be told
","Marvelous acting and an interesting story help compensate for an over long film that fades at the end. But lay aside the ending and bring a cup of coffee to help you through some of the slow moments, because you will be treated to some of the best acting of this year or any year. I've never been a fan of Matthew McConaughey but here he gives us his A game and his A game is equal to anyone's. It's not merely that he underwent dramatic physical changes, it's his emotional tone which is so on target. This is his career best and quite remarkable.<br/><br/>But he's not the only game in town. Jared Leto clearly comes into his own with this film, well beyond his previous work. And Jennifer Garner's brief role provides one of her best performances since she left ""Alias"".<br/><br/>The film is not only worthwhile for the bravura acting, it's also a very interesting look at the politics behind big Pharma, and the collusion between physicians, drug companies, and the government. This was a sad chapter in American health care, and though it is a subplot in the larger film, it is overdue for some scrutiny."
"whatalovelypark","3","4","7","22 October 2015"," Another overly simplistic biopic
","I find these biopics very hard to watch, though this is better than most.<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie is the hypocrisy. At one point the main character, Ron, argues that a study in the Lancet proves that a certain drug works, a drug that he is prevented from getting access to. Yet a theme throughout the movie involves an evil hospital doctor trying to stop people using drugs 'that work' so he can test a drug so a pharmaceutical company can get rich. How would he test that drug? Using exactly the same method that was used in the Lancet paper. Indeed, as was presented, it's difficult to know if something is working or not if patients are taking a range of drugs. You can't attack the scientific method and applaud it simultaneously.<br/><br/>In many ways this was an advertisement for cowboy science, which, as numerous scandals over the years have shown, is not a good idea, regardless of how desperate you are. Of course, the desperate patients (or their families) will probably be suing the companies and hospitals if the drug is later shown to be harmful and if it wasn't tested properly. This movie is a lawyers delight.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie didn't get much beyond a politician explaining a war in terms of 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. The performances were pretty good, though the script was not memorable. I don't think I'll be quoting lines from this movie.<br/><br/>It could have been such a better movie if it was presented in realistic greys rather than straight black and white. The story has been given the Hollywood treatment, and they know what they're doing. It got the crowds."

","Everything about this movie is greatthe script, the story, the development, the editing, the visuals, the characters—all of it is captivating and interesting. The movie has all the right emotion and all the right drama to make the film memorable and intriguing. However, I have to say that Matthew McConaughey's performance was the one thing I enjoyed the most.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed McConaughey's acting—I just haven't enjoyed a lot of the movies he's been in. However, as of the last few years, he's been moving away from romcoms and more towards the dramatic and it's really given him a place to show off how talented he is. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" really became another canvas for him to showcase his craft as he took an already interesting and potentially drama-filled product and made it really come to life. Ron Woodroof's battle with HIV and his desire to set up an organization to help others suffering from it during the major epidemic in the 80s is already interesting and engaging but McConaughey's ridiculously strong performance only made the film that much more attention-grabbing.<br/><br/>And it's not like the rest of the cast were any slouches either. Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto both play major characters in Woodroof's life and journey to establish the Dallas Buyers Club (although, their characters WERE completely made up for the film) and both of them were performing fantastically. There was also a spark of magic as the relationships these two had with the character of Woodroof took a film that was already dramatic and interesting on the surface and gave it added dimensions and depth and, ultimately, created a film that felt very personal and emotional.<br/><br/>Honestly, there was nothing I didn't like about ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and it really was put together well—the lighting, camera work, script, story, and (especially) the editing—but it was the performances and the chemistry that the main actors displayed. They made a film that was already hard-hitting with its drama and were able to successful make it real and personal. They integrated themselves perfectly into the final product and it came back a film that is just as powerful as the quote that is on the Blu-Ray case says it is.<br/><br/>Hi! My name is Rev.

","Film Review- The Dallas Buyers Club (2013) by raroe<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey for a long time as been one of my favourite actors, anything he is in I tend to enjoy (except for the numerous rubbish rom- coms but hey every ones got to pay the bills) this was no different.<br/><br/>The story of Ron Woodroof who is diagnosed as HIV positive in the 1980s, The film explores Ron's attempts to not only survive his situation but make a lot of money from it buy selling unapproved medicine. Over the years there as been some great transformations from actors becoming a character but I do not know any iv seen that is better then McConaugheys, both physical and mental transformation is explosive on the screen. Acting at its best.<br/><br/>I have not even mentioned the supporting performance by Jared Leto, who also plays a man suffering with HIV. who also physically transformed into his character who happens to be a transsexual. Leto is believable and brilliant.<br/><br/>My favourite film this year. Also my nod for the Oscar for best picture.<br/><br/>http://raroe.wordpress.com/"
"Amari-Sali","8","3","5","1 January 2014"," Though AIDS for most is a death sentence, it also can be that jolt which changes people's lives.
","Trigger Warning(s): Vocal Bigotry<br/><br/>I've been meaning to see this film for a few weeks and the first time I tried to it was sold out. Something that hasn't happened to me in years. So of course that heightened my interest, as well as the Oscar buzz for both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. So after purchasing a ticket online, which is always a smarter decision, I finally got to see this.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>The focus of the film is on an electrician/ bull-rider named Ron Woodroof. When we first meet him, he is the embodiment of your stereotypical redneck. He is sexist, racist, homophobic as hell, and then he finds out he got AIDS. Now, mind you, when Woodroof gets AIDS it is the 1980s so the disease is assumed to be solely something homosexual and drug addicts get, and while Woodroof may like coke he almost beats the crap out of anyone who dares hints he is gay. But, once he reveals his diagnosis to a friend, that is all they see him as, and with his health failing and him in denial of the disease, he finds himself in a position where either he can live to the 30 days Dr. Sevard (played by Denis O'Hare) prescribed, or fight.<br/><br/>Thus leading to what the majority of the movie is about. Woodroof's fight to live begins with him doing research while we, as an audience, slowly see how the health care industry, if not many of the world, decided to handle those with AIDS. Whether it be showing them as guinea pigs for the pharmaceutical industry, with FDA approval; or as social pariahs, especially those of the gay community, that is the world Woodroof finds himself in, with disdain for being associated with what the movie makes out to be an almost sole gay issue, outside of one sole woman.<br/><br/>Well, perhaps really two. Now, though Dr. Eve Saks (played by Jennifer Garner) maybe one of Woodroof's love interests, and the one who helps him with AIDS and through other issues, truly the woman who deserves the most credit for helping Woodroof evolve as a person is Rayon (played by Jared Leto). Rayon is a trans-gendered, pre-op, woman who helps Woodroof go from this bigoted man into one who seemingly does have a heart. The two form a bond in which while Woodroof travels the world in order to find drugs which deal with the symptoms of AIDS, as part of him running the Dallas Buyers Club, Rayon handles the fort and is almost the Virginia to Woodroof Bill Masters (from Masters of Sex).<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>One thing I love about this movie, amongst the other movies out recently featuring some butt hole as the lead, is Woodroof actually evolves in the movie, rather than pretty much stays the same person throughout. Also, like most movies, there is a good bit of comedy to get you through the movie, but perhaps what really needs to be praised is Jared Leto as Rayon. Many times in movies, a supporting actor being good can be considered when they outdo those who are considered the lead. However, Leto instead plays the part of supporting actor in such a way where while he may not outdo McConaughey, he almost seems like the crutch, or walker, which keeps the film moving and I think without Rayon this film wouldn't be half as good as it is.<br/><br/>As for McConaughey, unlike his likely competitors for various awards, what you must note is that Woodroof is the sole one which has heart. For though he is a bit of a bastard, with him actually evolving past that there is the slight desire to move past the person who we were introduced to. Also, the way McConaughey, and Leto as well, physically seem to falter due to their characters having AIDS seems more than simply makeup and them being skinny, but something which can actually, perhaps, make you forget that the real people who this is based on are dead.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>When it comes to issues though, I really couldn't find many for while I wasn't fond of the hate speech, most of those who participated got proper comeuppance. Also, I found it weird how only Woodroof and one woman were the sole, seemingly, heterosexuals with AIDS. Outside of that though, nothing really pops into my head. Though, after reading a bit about the film, I must admit it would have been interesting to see Woodroof's daughter in the film.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>To me, many of the bigger release which are getting Oscar buzz have a bit too much focus in trying to be funny than telling a story, and while Dallas Buyers Club surely has its moments in which the actors are trying to make you laugh, it feels like they are truly trying to use someone's real life story to do more than entertain you for 2 hours. Hence why I say this is worth seeing for, amongst the tales of con men and others, this to me stands out based off the films I've seen this season."
"loum-882-674578","8","3","5","27 December 2013"," The Louie ""Dallas Buyers Club"" Movie Review
","This is a true story of a man from Dallas who was your typical manly cowboy who contracted aids in the 80's. Matthew McConaughey did an excellent job at playing the real life person Ron Woodroof. He portrays the trials and tribulations of trying to go outside the system to get non approved medical help, dealing with the prejudice of his disease, his unlikely alliances with people that he would never before even consider being in the same room in. In addition his partner Rayon who is a transvestite played by Jared Leto was absolutely stupendous. Both Mathew and Jared will get nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor and I will be completely shocked if Jared does not win hands down. The metamorphosis of the individual characters and story line are truly great and kept your interest the entire movie. This movie will be enjoyed by all and I give it a solid B+."
"bobsgrock","Null","3","5","3 December 2013"," Matthew has AIDS
","Dallas Buyers Club is the type of film that seems to only receive the green light if a brave enough, or obtuse enough, high-profile actor attaches himself to the project, usually as both starring lead and producer. Matthew McConaughey joins the list, following in the footsteps of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and others. However, none of them changed their physical appearance to quite the dramatic level McConaughey has. Losing nearly forty pounds for the role of Ron Woodruff, a Texas man diagnosed with AIDS in 1985, the pasty, sallow skin stretched over a diminished skeletal structure certainly is a shock to most audiences, especially considering McConaughey is best known as a genial, strikingly attractive lead in various romantic comedies. <br/><br/>Moving away from that genre since 2009, McConaughey seems to have gotten tired of being boxed in as an actor and has put together a most impressive resume capable of showing his true potential as an actor. This is his most ""method"" performance, comparable to the likes of DeNiro in Raging Bull, although to the opposite extreme. Yet, beyond simply losing weight and gaining a mustache, McConaughey really digs deep into this character, willing to go to any length to show his drug abuse, unsafe sexual behavior and overall self-destructive tendencies as being rooted not just in Woodruff's life but in his community as well. Many of the early scenes in the film depict him at his favorite hangouts: the rodeo, where he seems to constantly hustle others, the bar where he downs shots and cigarettes like candy, and work where he shoots the breeze and more cigarettes. The main problem with the film is that just about covers its character study of Ron Woodruff.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, one gets rather frustrated at the seemingly inept structure and logic behind this story. For example, after being told that he has AIDS, Woodruff refuses to believe it, which follows what has already been shown. However, after some confusing visual tactics and a couple blank stares into the camera, he moves voraciously over books and articles, finding out enough information to be able to search out a certain drug he has read will slow down the HIV virus. Obvious to anyone who has seen this sort of rebel with a cause story before, the hospital and FDA refuse to give him anything more than a place in a study they are performing attempting to find out the effects of this drug. Rather than die by chance, he travels to Mexico, gets in contact with a formerly licensed doctor and discovers, or at least believes without much conviction, that there are alternate treatments which are not available in the U.S. due to said FDA. The battle lines have been drawn.<br/><br/>What follows lacks the energy and conviction one would hope for in a film of this type. McConaughey is game for this role, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. The problem is that the director, Jean-Marc Vallée, refuses to let him loose. Countless scenes seem so restrained and controlled that we get little sense of a man on the verge of dying from an incurable illness, which I can only imagine must be one the most terrifying and harrowing feelings possible in life. However, the film does not seem interested in such feelings, only in pushing the narrative forward but even that is disjointed at times. Jennifer Garner's frumpy doctor, with no life outside of work other than sitting at home and drinking wine, lacks any real interest or importance at all. So when she confronts Ron about a very serious development in the story, her lines come across as static and silly. How could she feel the way she claims to if we have seen little of this behavior? <br/><br/>The other noteworthy performance beside McConaughey is Jared Leto, an actor who seems to wait out for these kind of roles. Playing a transvestite and looking like the lovechild of Sigourney Weaver and David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, he too is game for going all in and leaving nothing to the imagination in this portrayal of two men on the brink of death and willing to go all in. Yet, the film maintains its breadth-over-depth stance. By the end, all we are left with are more questions about who exactly this Ron Woodruff was. Scenes involving his starting up the buyers club have the only true excitement and movement in the film. He travels the world looking for exotic and unavailable drugs and doctors who will write prescriptions for him. It's a sad fact when these are the most interesting sequences in a film revolving around people dying of the most devastating disease discovered in the last century. Perhaps Hollywood isn't ready to tell this type of story yet. Philadelphia was close but got bogged down in cliché courtroom sequences. This film bogs itself down by relying on obligatorily timed moments that leave nothing to chance. This may make for a safe story, but it cannot fit the true happenings of a person battling AIDS."
"ghost_dog86","8","3","5","19 November 2013"," If you thought Matthew McConaughey was skinny in ""Mud""
","These past two years have seen Matthew McConaughey go from B-list comedic actor, to arguably one of the top ten dramatic actors working today. And undoubtedly an Oscar nomination awaits McConaughey for this performance.<br/><br/>My extremely long synopsis: In the mid 80's, coinciding with the emergence of the drug AZT, a stereotypical homophobic Texas redneck named Ron Woodroof is informed by doctors that he is HIV positive and has thirty days to live. However, when he discovers that AZT does much more harm than good and the drugs that seem to be helping people are essentially illegal, he goes to Mexico for treatment. And upon discovering there is profit to be made off of the sale of non-FDA approved drugs that actually work, he decides to smuggle in the drugs and go head to head with Big Pharma by starting the Dallas Buyers Club (with the help of a homosexual cross-dresser played by Jared Leto) a club which provides its members (AIDS patients) with alternative medicine. There is also a pseudo-love story subplot concerning Ron and a doctor, played by Jennifer Garner, but it doesn't add anything to the story, so who cares.<br/><br/>Another aspect which adds little to the success of this film is the direction from Jean-Marc Vallee. Yet I don't count on many other critics making that statement in their reviews since McConaughey's physical transformation as well as his performance is such a welcome distraction, that it takes pressure off everyone else in this production.<br/><br/>Problems do arise when, on more than a few occasions, the script sets up a lighter comedic atmosphere than appropriate, considering the subject matter. That said, when Leto's character is introduced into the story (around 40 minutes in) even though he does play the comic relief of sorts, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" seems to become less about the comedy and wit and more about the dramatic entertainment. Furthermore, while critics will be going gaga over McConaughey's performance (as they should) Leto's great supporting performance demands to be recognized. Why he doesn't focus solely on acting and give up on that horrible band of his, is beyond me.<br/><br/>Side Note: Yes, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is entertaining, touching and even powerful at times, but with the story's focus being what it is, this is a movie that will still come under understandable scrutiny for one reason in particular: Much like ""The Help"", the hero of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is an outsider. What I mean by that is, in some people's eyes ""The Dallas Buyers Club"" will be nothing more than a movie about a homophobic cowboy with a heart of gold, who must come to the rescue of the poor, helpless homosexuals. And sadly because the plot and characters aren't really that layered, this criticism is unavoidable even though the movie itself may work.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Overall, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a four star film, with a couple of five star performances."
"meeza","8","3","5","2 December 2013"," The cure of this picture comes from McConaughey and Leto
","Dallas Buyers Club"" did not have a complete subscription of exemplary dosage, but it is still one you should buy into. Matthew McConaughey delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Ron Woodroof, a real-life Dallas electrician homophobe who was diagnosed with AIDS during the mid 80's. Woodroof took the opportunistic route and formed a ""buyers club"" to import and sell non-government approved drugs to AIDS patients via a membership program. Let's just say Ron Woodroof just ran with it and wanted to raise the roof of his bank account. Director Jean Marc-Vallee does a credible job in orchestrating the picture with the ""business opportunistic"" angle than making it a predictable sympathetic movie in dealing with the film's theme; however, the third act of the movie was way too wearisome for my taste and I was about to ask for a refund for the ""Dallas Buyers Club"" during the film's last 30 minutes. The writers' club of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" did a good job in scribing some clever zingers mostly coming from Woodroof's character. But no doubt the strengthening endurance of the movie was the lively performance from McConaughey and from Jared Leto who plays Ron's homosexual business partner Rayon. It will not be too difficult to sell the excellence of their thespian work in ""Dallas Buyers Club""; no doubt both will be soon joining the Oscar Nominee Club. So for the most part, medicate yourself with acting greatness from McConaughey & Leto in the ""Dallas Buyers Club"". **** Good"

","As my title suggests I would have preferred a different Director. The gratuitous sex scenes and nudity did nothing to enhance the plot. They were just to put bums on seats. The subject would have worked without it. We get the idea the main character is trailer trash, no need to keep harping on about it. Yes you do come to care about him throughout the film. The main characters were solid enough, but there was no need sell out! It is possible to maintain artistic integrity without this type of cop out. I love other films of this genre, for instance I loved MILK, but really didn't care for this. Van Sant would have done a much better job. I've also been reading much criticism from the trans-gender community over the poor portrayal of trans-gender people in the film."

","The film is based on Ron Woodruff's real life. It is a story of an AIDS patients' battle with the disease and life.<br/><br/>1986, Dallas: Ron is diagnosed with advanced AIDS, and he is told he has only 30 days to live. Unfortunately there are no approved drugs in the US at that time. Ron starts to do research on medication out of a strong willingness to survive. He visits doctors in other countries and buy lots of AIDS drugs and alternative therapies. He does this business and takes the drugs back to the US. In the beginning, he just sells some drugs for money. But later on, more and more AIDS patients reach out to him. Rayon is one of them. With Rayon's help, Ron establishes an organization called ""Dallas Buyers Club"". They provide drugs to their members - AIDS patients. The club gets bigger and bigger and attracts many AIDS patients around the world. In the story, Ron is fighting against the FDA. He is brave and is struggling with that. Ron passes away in 1992. He lives 7 years after he was diagnosed AIDS with only 30 days to live. <br/><br/>I think this movie definitely deserved an Oscar award. The story is so special, interesting, thought-provoking and touching. <br/><br/>The hero and the supporting actors are very impressive. I believe they lost a lot of weight to play AIDS patients, and almost totally changed their real appearances. I really like Rayon. Jared Leto's acting is vivid. The friendship of Ron and Rayon is so touching in the end. Ron's roar and horrible sadness with Rayon's passing away reflects AIDS patients' hopelessness and helplessness.<br/><br/>I am happy to see the progress of medicine and society in my life. AIDS can be treated and the discrimination has been corrected. However, we still have a long way to go. I think Ron Woodruff would be pleased if he saw the progress nowadays."

","Dallas Buyers Club is phenomenal! with the amazing performances of Matthew, Jared, and Jennifer. A well-acted and well-directed film.

Of all the drama film that I've watched, DBC is definitely first in the line. Matthew was amazing, portraying a cowboy diagnosed with AIDS, he really nailed it.

","It's 1985 Dallas. Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a hard-partying womanizing drug-user bull-rider. Rock Hudson has just come out with AIDS. When doctors gave him the diagnosis and 30 days to live, the homophobic Ron rejects it at first. Eventually he bribes a janitor to steal AZT. When the drug becomes impossible to steal, he goes to Mexico to see unlicensed Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne). He tells him that AZT is poison and starts putting a drug cocktail to treat his symptoms. With the help of transvestite Rayon (Jared Leto), he brings in drugs from outside the US and forms the Dallas Buyers Club. People pay a standard fee to receive all the drug treatments. The hospital and the DEA is bent on shutting him down in favor of the AZT trial. Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) is sympathetic but feels powerless to help.<br/><br/>The performances are amazing. Sure the weight loss is shocking, but they're doing more than skinny acting. Matthew is laying it all out in a complex performance. He is cocky and combative but also extremely vulnerable. Both Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner are superb support. The hero is not quite the saint as in 'Philadelphia', but that's part of its strength. This is a great performance."

But not necessarily because of his transformation, but what he managed to do with that transformation. The part that sticks out the most to me in this film is when his character is becoming incredibly sick. He is sitting at the motel with his boyfriend, and he begins to cough up blood. He begins to cry out ""I don't want to die."" The moment was so incredibly human and simple, but so perfectly done.

Without a doubt, the best performances of both to present (and I think the Academy will back me on this). Both actors play characters who are superficially difficult to empathize with (especially Ron), however, through a great script and powerful character portrayals, by the end of the picture we feel great emotions for Ron and Rayon. We also become invested in the complex relationship that develops between these two unlikely companions.<br/><br/>Great acting, great script, great sets and costumes. I should add that the story itself is very interesting. I did not know about the existence of this type of ""buyers club"" prior to the film, so I actually got a history lesson as well.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is, to me a highly emotional testament to the human spirit and will to fight against all odds."

The lengths these actors went to convey their characters was jaw-dropping to say the least. I commend this director on a flawless capturing of such a deep story.

","I absolutely loved this movie. I am always attracted to films that chronicle characters who go through dramatic personal growth, and Dallas Buyers club delivered in a way that was both touching and heartbreaking. A man starts out with not a single care for his own well being, let alone that of others, and when he is faced with the very epitome of the human condition, and by baby steps that begin with selfish motivations, he grows into something so much more to so many people. In fighting his own battle, helps others to fight theirs, and eventually he becomes a better man. Mathew's acting is brilliant, as well as Jared Leto's portrayal of an emotionally damaged, hard-shelled transgender person living with AIDS. I literally did not see Jared Leto at all while watching the movie, because he quite literally became the character. In a day and age where movies can equal big bucks, and some are produced just for that purpose, whether they are quality films or not, I was caught off guard by how great Dallas Buyers Club was. I was especially skeptical going in, considering that so many just plain strange films have won the major categories at the Oscars in the last decade or so. Violence for the sake of violence, gimmicky film making, and surreal, shallow plot lines have ruled at the Academy Awards in past years...Django Unchained being one prime example, in my opinion. But, this film gave me what I like best, which is a great story that gripped my emotions and made me think!"
"herbqedi","10","2","3","8 March 2014"," Absolutely Remarkable Movie and Performances
","I am avid movie lover and have seen more than 2,000 movies in my tome - and remember most of them. The best male lead performance I have ever seen is Paul Schofield in a Man For All Seasons. In second place, I had Paul Lukas in Watch on the Rhine - until now. I've long liked McConnaughy and found him very impressive in We Are Marshall and The Lincoln Lawyer. Neither performance set me up for this. His every mannerism, every nuance, every way of carrying himself in every scene and every situation is utterly on target. This is a terrific movie and almost the entire cast is flawless but the lead performance is truly in a class by itself.<br/><br/>The next point I wish to make is that this is one of the few of the very many independent movies I've seen that involved HIV and the gay community without hitting the viewer over the head with it even though it was 100% central to the plot. What I mean is that there was none of the normal obligatory gilding of the lily just to make sure the viewer gets the message.<br/><br/>Also interesting is the fact that both McConnaughy and Leto (also 100% Oscar-worthy) manage to play larger-than-life characters convincingly without ever acting larger-than-life. It's a subtlety and rare that actors can play such characters without chewing up the scenery but both manage somehow to do it which speaks quite well for the director. <br/><br/>The pacing is considerably better than most indies or Hollywood non- action dramas. I only looked at my watch once. Griffin Dunne is noteworthy in his supporting performance. Jennifer Garner is far better than in the last movie she did about battling Big Pharma, Love and Other Drugs. She still tries a quarter-of-an-octave too hard, but that's really getting picky in one of the best movies I've seen in this century thus far."

","Dallas Buyers Club is a MUST SEE film, the best film, in my opinion in 2013 and in quite some time. Matthew McConaughey was at his best and obviously had to go through some major physical transformations. He puts on a performance of a lifetime and is now rewarded with the honors. Not to forget Jared Leto's amazing, top notch performance and also went through a lot of physical transformation, which may be overlook by Matthew's performance. The film covers an era of America's denial of the seriousness of HIV / AIDS and also shows the dangers of what the FDA can present to the health and medicine marketplace. The emotion this film integrates is like no other, there are moments of laughter, sadness, and redemption as these stars put on a memorable display of art and magic. This film is by far a 10 and a must see by all walks of life."

Matthew McConaughey with a disappointing start to his film career proves that he is one of the best actors right now! The performances from Jared Leto and McConaughey are outstanding! Not only their unbelievable character transformations but the emotion, the power, the rawness they brought to their roles is something very special.<br/><br/>Riveting story, incredible performances! A film that needs to be seen!"

","McConaughey lost 38 pounds. Jared Leto, god she is beautiful. By plot if you think this movie has the flavor of depression, you're wrong. The damn movie is full of performances, Academy Awards second me in this. As Ron Woodproof, McConaughey lost everything making sure that he looks like the one with the broken immune system. On the other side, the version of Jared as Rayon is flawless, he anyway isn't new, we all know his capability from 'Requiem for a Dream', as a fag his expressions are spontaneous especially in the scene when Ron for the first time was being nice to Rayon, didn't know how many caught insects in their mouth. Every frame of the movie is admirable, Biographies hardly needed a change from the actor, unlike this one and exactly why its better than so many of its kind."
"Suave785","9","2","3","7 March 2014"," A touching drama with some Texas kick
","You have to take this movie at face value for what it is. The movie is a pure representation of the train of thought that was so prevalent in the 80's. I grew up in the 80's in the south and a lot of my own opinions were based on biased opinions. I was told that HIV and AIDS were diseases that only affected those that were gay and sinners. I was even told that the disease might of got its origins from men from Africa having sex with monkeys and bringing it to the US. We all know that is not true but back then it didn't matter. I really liked this movie because it didn't try to sugarcoat how America and even the lead characters felt about a disease that most people still don't understand. Matthew McConaughey has always been a favorite actor of mine as he brings that southern accent to the bring screen that reminds me of home. He did a good job of letting his Texas roots run deep in his role. Jared Leto also made another unbelievable transformation for this movie and probably is the best method actor of our current generation. You take those two actors and you add a superb supporting cast and you come out with this gem known as The Dallas Buyers Club. A great movie about a very painful subject in life. The movie gave me a chance to experience some of what I viewed in a negative light as a youth and opened my eyes. While this film opened very many eyes it is so obvious to see that a movie with this type of message and content most certainly could not of been made 20-30 years ago. The presentation of this movie on a global scale shows how far we have come and that through tragedy and sickness comes some of the most loved and cherished moments in ones life."
"bm2759","9","2","3","7 March 2014"," Oscar winning performances
","Wow. No wonder Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto won Oscars for this film. They're both brilliant in showcasing two faces of AIDS sufferers which oppose each other; one being a fighter doing all they can to prolong their life and the other succumbing to their disease by giving in and not taking their treatment seriously. What's beautiful is the characters themselves are polar opposites and this disease brings them together which results in helping many people.<br/><br/>Unlike Philadelphia which gave us a personal story which shows us a complete journey of an AIDS sufferer til death, this film instead chooses to highlight how different people react to a disease differently. It also highlights how much of a joke the US health system is, particularly in how they addressed AIDS - other countries were putting out drugs which were effective and easier to access; whereas the US would put a harmful product out as a reaction to public need without proper analysis whilst also limiting access. When the film ended I wanted to see more of Ron Woodruff's story or at least a photo of what he looked like.<br/><br/>It's a must see film that will surprisingly make you laugh too."
"ted-peterson","10","2","3","28 February 2014"," An Ayn Rand, Objectivist Statement About Self-Interest
","Spoiler Alert: Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. <br/><br/>Back in the '80s many people thought HIV and AIDS were the same thing. There was a lot of ignorance on the part of doctors and practitioners alike. <br/><br/>What this movie show and shows well is that ignorance can be overcome. It's easier for a person to be moved than an institution. And it accurately shows how self-interest is a better motivator than restriction. Ayn Rand would have seen this message and understood how self- interest can motivate a person to accomplishments far beyond his or her reach. <br/><br/>But the movie is not an Objectivist propaganda piece nor is it a total condemnation of the medical field. It is a condemnation of how restrictive thinking can harm many more people than it helps and that is the bigger message in this multi-messaged movie. <br/><br/>McConaughey plays Ron Woodruff a real-life character in every sense of the word. He's a hard living, hard drinking rodeo rough-stock rider back before professional bull riding became a popular TV and international sport. There is no way to know how accurate the story is but one suspects that the real Ron embodied many of the most negative qualities of the ""redneck"" lifestyle including prejudice. <br/><br/>But in a very ""Atlas Shrugged"" or ""Fountainhead"" sense, self interest can open a person's eyes and apparently that's what happened to Ron. <br/><br/>McConaughey has taken some pretty gritty roles. His portrayal of Ron closely resembles the character he has created for his character in ""True Detective"" a cable crime drama. But the grittiness of strip joints, drugs and alcohol don't override the interesting parts of this movie. They are there like a painting may have blue pigment but not be a blue painting. It's there to show where Ron came from. He was medically ignorant and so into self-satisfaction that he never gave a thought to anyone else. There is a moment in the movie when he returns to his single wide only to find ""Faggot Blood"" pained on his door and every side of the trailer. His still ignorant friends think he must be a ""faggot"" to contract HIV and AIDS. There is no indication that their opinion was ever changed which shows that self-interest is a greater educational tool than propaganda. <br/><br/>Ron battles everyone but especially the government who through petty functionaries (After all, they are only following orders and the law.) fight ever move assiduously to enforce restrictions that have no purpose other than to line the pockets of established US drug companies. In that sense, the movie is a pot boiler where nobody wins and every success is nothing more than a stop at an oasis during a long desert march. <br/><br/>There are many drugs that are sold internationally that are not approved by the FDA and many that are. A quick scan of TV ads for legal drugs to combat everything from arthritis to high cholesterol gives a list of side effects that are perilous indeed. One wonders. . .<br/><br/>The fight for sick people to injects what the hell they want in the Libertarian sense will go on as long as drug company self interest are heeded above individual self interest. <br/><br/>The ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a must see movie. It's at least as good as the Pacino effort ""You Don't Know Jack"" about another stalwart who is fighting to ease the pain of patients in opposition to the feds. <br/><br/>M 10 The characters are well done all."

","I am guessing only a (native) Texan will ""get"" a Rodeo-riding, multi-girl pounding, 80's homophobic/racist redneck, per se. But as an outsider (residing in Bogotá, Colombia), I think Matthew McConaughey's performance was *superb*. For an ""ignorant cowboy"" he put a hell of a fight with the FDA people, let alone the AIDS disease & HIV virus, as well as with his arrogant, self-serving persona. This is a story about reality, morality, courage & self preservation. Watching McConaughey transformed into 130lbs of anger & determination was highly entertaining, as it was convincing. Maybe Hollywood ""pretty boys"" have more to offer than good looks!!"
"comicman117","9","2","3","9 February 2014"," A Terrific Experience
","Dallas Buyers Club opens with a scene of Matthew McConaughey humping a woman while at a bull riding venue. There is no dialog in the scene, just the sound effect of ""screeching"". This opening scene more or less sets the audience up for what they should expect the film to be like. Certainly, it is one of the more interesting ways in which a director opens his film this year.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is based off the story of Ron Woodroof, played by Matthew McConaughey, who lost 40 pounds for this role and almost dominates the film. Woodroof was a handsome, macho, playboy, homophobic bull rider, but after he was diagnosed with HIV, due to unprotected sex, he starts to see things a little differently. After getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Woodroof gets AZT to treat HIV/AIDs, but due to consuming AZT, as well as substance abuse, Woodroof comes close to dying. Realizing this, Woodroof starts a worldwide search for a fallen doctor (Griffin Dunne) who prescribes antiviral drugs. Along the way, Woodroof meets Rayon, a transvestite who changes Woodroof's views on homosexuals, and played by Jared Leto, who is completely transformed in this role, with makeup and weight loss much like McConaughey. Becoming an inspiration for HIV/AIDS people everywhere, Woodroof, along with his friend Rayon, starts The Dallas Buyers Club, a new place for HIV people, which eventually leads him directly in conflict with the FDA.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club shows how ""greedy"" and untrustworthy pharmaceutical companies can be. The film actually seems to support two different sides. On the one side, you have Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) and Richard Barkley (Michael O'Neill) representing the ""corrupt"" side of things. More motivated by money than anything else, they don't even seemingly bother to look at how good their prescriptions are. The other side is the ""good guys"", the ones who seemingly want to help: Eve (Jennifer Garner), and Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne). Some people are just in it for the money and are not to be trusted.<br/><br/>The acting is, for the most part, pretty great. This film relies heavily on its performances. As mentioned above, both McConaughey and Leto lost a lot of weight to play their roles, and both actors are very skinny. McConaughey, as Woodruff, delivers an Oscar worthy performance. His accent fits the character perfectly, and he portrays an abuser with tremendous power. When McConaughey says ""#uck"" when he discovers that he is truly diagnosed with HIV and AIDS, his scream is delivered priceless. McConaughey, as an actor, has gone through a major career change, and is no longer considered a joke among his peers. He went from being a promising actor, the male lead in ""lousy romantic comedies"", and to where he is now, a real serious dramatic actor. The fact that he manages to snag so many award nominations, and even win a few, as well the Oscar possibly, speaks volumes of how much he has changed as an actor.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be the first to say the film's most outstanding performance is not from McConaughey himself, but from Jared Leto as Rayon. His voice, his makeup, its all done perfectly, transformed into his role as a transvestite. Sometimes, I even swear he was a woman. His performance in Dallas Buyers Club, feels very much like a Leto performance, as it continues his willingness to do anything for a role. It's not hard to see why he is the front-runner this year for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Most of the other performances in the film are good, but those two are especially outstanding. Jennifer Garner is unmemorable in the role as Eve a doctor. Though Garner isn't awful, her performance leaves much to desire. Thankfully even the writers realized that, as the film seems to be more about the relationship between Woodroof and Rayon, then that of Woodroof and Eve. Denis O'Hare and Michael O'Neill are just playing stock corrupt doctors and aren't developed much beyond that, which may be considered one of the films biggest weakness, though it didn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>The direction by French Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee is especially good. Just about every shot is clear. The decision to have scenes without dialog and just ""screeching"", was especially interesting. If this was in the wrong hands, it could have potentially been disastrous. The editing is also good and the film flows at a nice pace, being a little less than 2 hours. Dallas Buyers Club is an extraordinary film which shows just how far one man with AIDS went to find a cure. The acting and directing makes the film and it is definitely one of 2013's very best."
"natalierosen","10","2","3","9 February 2014"," Phenomenal Acting
","This was an excellently performed film and, indeed, about an era I remember well, but would, in fact, like to forget. It was a time when the gay male friends I knew were feared even by me--a lifetime lefty liberal seemingly humane and empathetic. I remember reading the headlines of this new so called ""gay cancer"" that grabbed my attention as I made sure not to drink from my gay male friend's glass or even let him use my soap. I am ashamed of all this now. We did not know and let fear and stupidity rule the day like Arthur Miller's crucible told of witches, and demons and man's feeble attempt to deal with that which he did not understand. We think in our era we are better than that but no I suspect we are the same as we continue to see the other demonized and even killed.<br/><br/>This film, a true story, is as riveting as it is sad. Sad that we as a nation wasted precious time because we could not look at the ugliness of AIDS and we could not stop thinking it was a gay disease. It wasn't just a gay disease it was an every man's disease as the virus made no exception just for gays. So many would not touch those we deemed untouchable. It was an era of ignorance, hatred, and vicious homophobia as if it were not enough that gays of that time hated themselves and did not need the mark of Cain or the scarlet letter to fuel the fans of hatred already entrenched.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey was brilliant. The Best Actor Academy Award category will be a hard one from which to choose, indeed, as those nominated are excellent in their own right but McConaughey is no less so. Jared Leto as supporting actor won the Golden Globe award and may win the Academy Award as well. He was superb. <br/><br/>This may be a difficult to watch film but it is a necessary to watch film as we try, however, feebly, to exorcise our own demons and frailties from our souls."

They both lost a vast amount of weight, Jared had to wax his whole body, to fit their roles and come across believable and true.

","In perhaps one of the most emotionally charged, brave, brilliantly acted films of the year DALLAS BUYERS CLUB opens door to emotions and facts and history that to this day remain tightly closed - a film about the AIDS plague. Based on a true story and written with sensitivity by Craig Borden and Melisa Wallack and directed with equal verve and insight by Jean-Marc Vallée (The Young Victoria, C.R.A.Z.Y.), this is a film that lingers in the mind long after the closing credits. It deserves to be seen by everyone, not only for the incredibly fine performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, but because of the questions it raises about the interplay of disease, drug companies and current governmentally controlled medical practice guidelines.<br/><br/>Texan Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is an electrician, a rodeo cowboy, a heavy drinker and cocaine abuser, and a woman chaser for casual sex. In 1985, Ron is blindsided by being diagnosed as H.I.V. -positive and given 30 days to live. Yet he will not, and does not, accept a death sentence. His crash course of research reveals a lack of approved treatments and medications in the U.S. (especially the prolonged investigation of AZT), so Ron crosses the border into Mexico where he discovers Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), a discredited American physician with his own battery of drugs to fight AIDS. Woodroof learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the U.S., challenging the medical and scientific community including his concerned physician, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner). A true homophobe, Ron finds an unlikely ally in fellow AIDS patient Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual who shares Ron's lust for life. Rayon also shares Ron's entrepreneurial spirit: seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines and supplements, they establish a buyers club, where H.I.V.-positive people pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Ron's pioneering underground collective beats loud and strong. With a growing community of friends and clients, Ron fights for dignity, education, and acceptance. In the years following his diagnosis, the embattled Lone Star loner lives life to the fullest like never before.<br/><br/>In addition to the brilliant performances by McConaughey and Leto, there far fine cameos by Jennifer Garner, Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Donna Duplantier and Griffin Dunne. This is a stunning cinematic achievement."

","Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) has been diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. But surely that's a mistake because he ""ain't no homo"". ""Dallas Buyers Club"" does a good job of establishing the character of Ron Woodroof with that of what he needs to do to survive. He lives in Dallas, lives a very disgusting lifestyle and should be close to dead. But he also likes making money and disregarding authority.<br/><br/>McConaughey, as he is able to do, imbibes Mr. Woodroof with enough charm and likability that we care to follow him, but the faster we get past his less charming moments the better. The film hits its stride when we meet Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual also suffering from AIDS/HIV, and when we travel to Mexico to secure drugs otherwise unavailable in the United States.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a bordering-on-illegal club that Woodroof sets up to sell drugs to fellow sufferers. It serves a dual purpose of providing needed to care to a disenfranchised community of society and making Mr. Woodroof more money. He's this AIDs patient / cowboy / business man that really is pretty amusing. Along with the Texas accent and swagger, it's the type of mix that only McConaughey can pull off.<br/><br/>Rayon and Woodroof have an interesting relationship in the beginning. The homophobic Woodroof can't stand the transsexual Rayon but Rayon can put him in touch with the homosexual community which has the money and need to buy life-saving drugs. Woodroof has to face the conundrum of money versus homophobia. He chooses money.<br/><br/>That early comedy moves into drama as we learn more of Rayon's life, which is not a happy one. But Woodroof continues with this Texan swagger as he attempts to win over Eve (Jennifer Garner), a doctor in charge of the HIV drug trials and who prefers to do things according to protocol. Woodroof, of course, does not like doing things according to protocol.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" does mostly follow protocol but it was the many light and humorous moments of the movie that are most memorable."

I had never seen any of his work before, and I am excited to see more from him, hopefully soon. His finished product is an incredible, heartbreaking, emotional and beautiful piece of film. Something I am most of all impressed by is its very low budget of under six million dollars. It is common for movies in recent years to have bloated budgets ten times the size of this one, in the 50-60 million range, and not pack even one-tenth the punch as this movie did.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are all outstanding and noteworthy, and the chemistry between the actors is fantastic. McConaughey, Leto and Garner bring the characters to life and make them feel real opposed to many ""real life"" movies where the characters end of feeling plastic.<br/><br/>I would definitely see this movie again.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","2","3","15 January 2014"," Vibrant and gritty, hilarious and heartfelt. Extraordinary turns from McConaughey and Leto.
","First off, Matthew McConaughey gives the best performance of the year. He's a swaggering rock star in the form of a beat down cowboy. Watching him is pure catharsis. This is a film about prejudice. On one side, there's the AIDs victims, the majority are homosexual males and some of which are fairly effeminate. On the other side are the brute working man; over-masculine, excessive and ignorant. The former are desperately looking for treatment, the latter are having threesomes. While we follow the prejudice of McConaughey's Ron Woodroof, it's difficult to not have some prejudice against him ourselves. But as his opinion is altered throughout the film, so is ours on him. Woodroof's charm and passion for justice, despite his vices, is utterly magnetic. McConaughey is hilarious and heartfelt. While it's surprising he can deliver a performance like this after a decade like the 2000s, the character is not too far from his style. Perhaps he's finally found the right fit. I really like his performances in the recent Mud and Killer Joe and I think he proved his talent in the 90s with Lone Star and Dazed and Confused, but Dallas Buyers Club is a pure 'born to play' role. <br/><br/>Directed by French-Canadian Jean-Marc Valee, there's a distinct European vintage style to his work, the only other film of his I've seen is the French-language C.R.A.Z.Y. The cinematography and costume design are gritty and saturated, but vibrant and alive. It feels like it was shot in the 80s. The film is full of compelling contradictions like these in all aspects of its design. It's a shame that the editing is not similar. It's punchy. Too punchy. I can't count the amount of times Woodroof passed out and it featured a harsh cut to black. It's exhausting and overstimulating. Which, you could say, reflects the tone of the film and characters ideally, but it affects the power of its payoffs and can end up confusing. It's one of the films where I read the script beforehand and my main problem was the pacing was too rushed. Fortunately it doesn't affect my investment in the characters. As McConaughey has said in awards speeches, the script has been passed around 86 times and that's a surprising figure given that it's such a great underdog tale. That said, I do feel like it's oversimplified in points, particularly with miracle drug vs. poison and the magical disbarred doctor who can cure AIDs. Feels a tad too Hollywood.<br/><br/>However, while I disagree with critics who consider the above mere pedestrian, we all agree on worthy praise to Jared Leto. He's a strange actor, there's something cold and artificial about him, but entirely sincere. His most memorable performances before Dallas Buyers Club are probably Fight Club and Requiem For A Dream where he was memorable, but outshone by his cast-mates. Given the hype, I was underwhelmed with Leto at first. While Rayon is certainly unique to this world, he's not necessarily granted cinematic entrances. Perhaps this is a case of an actor making the best of a relatively weak character. However, once he's stripped off his identity and put in a suit to talk to his father, the humanity of Leto's performance is laid bare. It's a portrait of a man facing mortality and what to do with his last days and Leto absolutely shattered my heart. While reading the script, I wasn't sure if Leto could really transcend the page and he didn't exactly let me down at first but boy did he surprise me when the big guns were pulled out. Although I prefer Fassbender in 12 Years A Slave for this year, it will be a well deserved Oscar win and one we wouldn't have been able to predict not even a year ago. Dallas Buyers Club is an entertaining and poignant film that's worth watching beyond its two star performances.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This film tells the story of a HIV infected man selling an unapproved cocktail of drugs to help the HIV infected people in Dallas.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey was a heart throb who appears topless in romantic comedies. He was known for his looks and his muscles. In the recent few years, he matured in both his looks and his acting skills. From a psychopathic character in ""Killer Joe"", a sadomasochistic homosexual character in ""The Paperboy"" or a lonesome fugitive in ""Mud"", he shows much skill and versatility in his roles. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" pushes his impressive portfolio even further, as he loses much weight and transform himself into an emaciated person for the role as an HIV infected man. His transformation is quite alarming, and reminds me of the classic transformation by Christian Bale for ""The Machinist"".<br/><br/>Jared Leto is also amazing as a man who identifies as a woman. His / her mannerisms and even the voice is so convincing. The time when he walks into his father's office, retorting his father's remark about God is truly heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The plot raises questions as to where we should draw the line of what is right and what is wrong. Is smuggling life saving medicine wrong? What drug should be approved and why? There are so many questions left for the viewers to ponder on.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a very good drama, with excellent acting and a very touching plot. I hope it wins a few Oscars."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.2/5 stars<br/><br/>July, 1985. While taking bets on a fellow bull rider at the rodeo Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) glances at the day's newspaper. The headline notes that actor Rock Hudson has admitted to having the AIDS virus. Muttering some profanities, Woodroof goes on about his business. Sadly, he'll soon learn that AIDS is also his business.<br/><br/>Featuring two bravura performances, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a hard hitting drama that looks at the world in the early days of the AIDS epidemic. An accident at work causes Ron to go to the hospital, where his blood is tested. When Ron learns that he is HIV positive he goes into denial, claiming to anyone that will listen that he's not gay. The news worsens when his diagnosis shows that his illness had escalated into full-blown AIDS and he is given a mere 30 days to live. With time running out, Ron does some quick research and learns about the experimental drug AZT. When the hospital refuses to grant him access to AZT, which was still in trials at that point, he reacts angrily. ""Screw the FDA,"" he says, ""I'm going to be DOA!"" He finds a contact at a local hospital that steals the drug for him in exchange for money but soon that avenue closes. Later, Ron learns that the drug is readily available in Mexico from an unlicensed MD - played perfectly by a nearly unrecognizable Griffin Dunne – who informs him that the highly toxic levels in AZT has nearly left him dead. With his own prescriptions of alternative medicines he nurses Ron back and gives him a fighting chance against AIDS. Realizing how effective the non-FDA-approved drugs are, Woodroof begins importing them for his own use, but also to ""give away"" to those who need it – provided they can afford the hefty monthly fee necessary to belong to his ""club"". This is where the seeds for the ""Dallas Buyers Club"" – an establishment that challenges the unfair and inconsiderate system – are sown. The great conflicts set up here are Woodroof's efforts to fool the Border Patrol, the FDA, the DEA, and the doctors who put regulations before the slim hopes of desperate, dying patients.<br/><br/>Woodroof, who is initially presented as an entirely unlikable bigot, partners with Rayon (Jared Leto), a flamboyant transgender he meets at an early hospital stay. Rayon's task is to recruit club members, while Woodroof works to outsmart the FDA. A great touch — the way this friendship of convenience builds. McConaughey delivers the brazen, foul- mouthed laughs and Leto tugs at your heartstrings. Their relationship is the true heart of the film, just as McConaughey and Leto's performances are its strength. Each actor was called upon to become frighteningly emaciated in order to play these men who clung to life with pure tenacity.<br/><br/>In the past couple of years Matthew McConaughey has transformed himself from the smiling guy with the Texas-twang in countless romantic comedies to an actor to be reckoned with. Dropping almost 40 pounds of weight for the role, his sunken eyed character bears no resemblance to the smiling, handsome star many fans are familiar with. In fact, if you didn't know that McConaughey was playing Ron Woodroof, you might be hard pressed to identify him in the film. But it's not just the physical changes that make this performance so good. A definite homophobe, Ron soon finds himself the subject of jokes and innuendos by his former friends when his condition is learned. Ron learns the new rules life is teaching him. McConaughey portrays the real-life Woodroof on screen as a complex combination of sharp edges and unbridled gusto. He has an improbable vitality that emerges from some unfathomable wellspring of strength. The man should have been dead, but instead outlived his 30-day sentence by seven years. Enough time to build a mini-empire and become a soldier against a broken system.<br/><br/>An utterly unrecognizable Jared Leto plays a cross-dressing gay AIDS patient who sees Woodroof's traveling/smuggling pharmacy as a lifeline, and ignores Ron's homophobia long enough for them to team up and steal an idea that's worked elsewhere. Leto is entirely transformed. His inflections, demeanor, movements, mannerisms, and expressions are all aligned in service of his radical transfiguration. That outer work pales in comparison with the stunning vulnerability of his performance, though.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club, which is notable for the actors' physical alterations, is ultimately about the transformation of a man from a homophobic wastrel into the leader of a grassroots campaign for survival — both his own, and those he once reviled. The based-on-true-events story follows McConaughey as Ron Woodroof - a gambling, womanizing, homophobic, self-proclaimed one-man rodeo drunkard who becomes an unlikely anti-establishment hero. He emerges as the leader of a fight to get non-FDA-approved drugs and supplements to AIDS patients during the volatile early days of the epidemic.<br/><br/>Ron Woodroof's story has a universal appeal in that it examines the way in which our greatest challenges call upon us to be more than we could ever imagined to. In the film, Woodroof says, ""I've only got one life; I want it to mean something."" His illness assured that it did. When we are broken there is an opportunity for us to reform and allow our better selves to emerge. That's just what this rodeo-loving, whore-mongering, whiskey-drinking, son-of-a gun did; and in the movie version of his life, he does so in a highly entertaining way to behold.<br/><br/>The films is a pro-active, uplifting and thoroughly entertaining jaunt through AIDS history, and the epic commitment of its actors to do right by it. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is not only one of the best movies of the year, it's easily one of the best movies of all time."

","9 of 10. While on the surface this is a film about AIDS, it goes way beyond it into government corruption at the FDA. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto do their best to replicate and go beyond Christian Bale's body reduction to skin and bone in The Machinist and The Fighter. While Matthew retains recognizability, I needed the credits to verify who Jared played.<br/><br/>As deserving as the lead actors are of recognition, the story and supporting characters prevent the film from becoming a simple Oscar melodrama to feature actors in a tear jerking story. The actors playing the corrupted corporate stooges at the FDA, DEA, hospitals, and in court are essential to giving the film depth and intensity. The characters are complex too. It's not often you get a bull riding rodeo fan, oil rig working tough guy Texan who is also an electrician addicted to gambling, drugs, and ""pussy"".<br/><br/>Set in the mid to late 1980s while drugs/procedures were still in the exploratory phase for AIDS, it has a lot more to say about how drugs are approved and prescribed than any other non-documentary film that's ever been made.<br/><br/>Addendum: A thank you to Tony Heck for reminding me of Puncture (2011), even if his review is short sighted and tedious. Puncture is another great, fact-based film involving needles, drugs, and AIDS. It takes more of a legal focus and lacks the acting and action of DBC, but does indeed have a better overall story. Getting into an argument, however, over which of the 2 is better is really only relevant for long winded critics who are ignoring they are enjoying 2 of the best films ever made."

","Dallas Buyers Club is a low budget biographical movie, portraying the life of Ron Woodroof, a Dallas electrician who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986 and who soon after that started the 'Dallas Buyers Club' – a club made exclusively for people diagnosed with AIDS who paid a fixed membership fee and in return got as much experimental drugs (that were also unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration) as they needed. At some point in the development of the movie, first Brad Pitt and afterwards Ryan Gosling, were attached to play Ron Woodroof, but the role finally went to Matthew McConaughey – which turned out to be a magnificent casting choice, but I'll get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) engaged in activities he likes best – having sex with women, doing drugs and watching bull riding. However, his life soon takes an unexpected turn when he has an accident on his job, ends up in a hospital and is there informed by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) and Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) that he has AIDS and will die in 30 days. He doesn't believe them at first, but when he starts feeling more and more sick, he decides he will do anything to survive, including starting the aforementioned Buyers Club.<br/><br/>Despite being a movie based on a real life story that deals with difficult topics, like living with AIDS, fighting the 'system' (FDA) and fighting for survival, Dallas Buyers Club is a surprisingly funny movie. The movie works both as a depiction of a real life drama and a black comedy - much of the humor comes from Ron's interaction with his transgender friend Rayon (Jared Leto) - and I enjoyed both of these aspects equally. Matthew McConaughey is an experienced actor in both this genres and he was the perfect choice for the role of Ron Woodroof. His performance was absolutely amazing and I think it's safe to say he will be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. And speaking of Academy Awards – Jared Leto is amazing as Rayon and I wouldn't be shocked if he got more recognition, in form of a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I'm not much of a Jared Leto fan, but I must admit he was incredible in the movie.<br/><br/>Of course, not everyone in the movie was as good as McCounaughey and Leto. And with that, I mainly mean Jennifer Garner, who was just bleak and underwhelming as Dr. Eve Saks, and personally I wouldn't have minded if her character had been completely cut out of the movie. Actually, both her character and Jared Leto's character Rayon were made up exclusively for the movie (which is rather obvious since they fall into stereotypical Hollywood character clichés) but while Rayon's character and his relationship with Ron works and is somewhat plausible, the character of Eve was the movie's third wheel. However, McCounaughey and Leto have more than enough charisma to make Dallas Buyers Club a very pleasant and funny experience.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"Red_Identity","Null","2","3","4 January 2014"," Amazing acting
","I liked this film quite a bit, but it really belongs to Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Both are absolutely amazing in their roles, but Matthew impressed me more simply because I haven't thought he's been great in any of his other recent performances. In fact, I'd thought people were overrating him, but he completely disappears in this. He owns the role, through and through, and instantly makes Ron likable in spite of how he starts off. I really have nothing else to say, the script and directing are pretty good but the film wouldn't be anything without these two central performances. Garner was decent, although I would have liked a more capable actress in the role."

","There are two artistic things in the movie. One is rodeo, and the other is the hand-painted wildflower paintings left by Ron Woodroof's mother. The cowboy represents the struggle, and the wildflower symbolizes warmth. In other words, the leading actor Ron is a cowboy, expressing his unyielding spirit, and the supporting actor Rayon is a wildflower, reflecting the warm side of the movie."

"austincoleman-66971","10","1","1","21 February 2019"," A damn PERFECT performance
","Matthew McConaughey's work in this film is sensational.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this, the cynic that I tend to be, I was waiting for the ""other shoe to drop""...i.e. a wasted scene or bit of dialogue, but it never came. Every moment of MM's portrayal of Ron matters. A lot has been said of the physical measures that both MM and Jared Leto (who is also brilliant) took to become these characters. As impressive as that is, the emotional aspect and genuine investment elevates these performances to new heights.<br/><br/>This story is heart wrenching and the screenplay is so fantastic in vividly capturing a difficult subject and conflict.<br/><br/>It isn't a perfect film holistically...there are parts of character development (albeit very few) that seem a bit rushed. The main antagonist is pretty generic. However, in the shadow of the main characters, it simply doesn't matter and does not warrant less than a score of 10 in my book."
"deloudelouvain","9","1","1","29 January 2019"," Wonderful movie with outstanding performances.
","2014 was a great year for the Academy Awards. Dallas Buyers Club won three Oscars and they deserved it especially the best performance by an actor in a leading role for Matthew McConaughey, and the best performance by an actor in a supporting role for Jared Leto. What a devotion of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto to loose respectively 47 and 30 pounds to play their characters. Matthew McConaughey looked really bad, which was the point, and deserved credits for his devotion but also for his best acting performance ever. He was just incredible in his role, and so was Jared Leto. The rest of the cast was also really good. Add to that a fascinating story based on true events and you get a movie that doesn't let anybody indifferent. The pharmaceutical industry in the United States is one of the biggest, shameful and corrupted system in the world and nobody seems to care over there. It's been going on for decades and still nothing changed. The right for medication at a fair price should be mandatory instead of trying to earn as much money as possible from people that are dying. The USA and all his citizens should be deeply ashamed that there is still no affordable medication for everyone. If you're rich there is no problem in the USA, but if you're unlucky not to be super rich and you get hit by a terrible disease you might as well just shoot yourself in the brains. My wife is American by the way, and when she came over here to live in Belgium and later Spain she couldn't believe the difference of price she had to pay for the exact same medication. The whole American health system is a farce and that for a country that sees itself as a world dominating power. Watch this movie and maybe you'll learn something from it. Dallas Buyers Club is a wonderful movie about that whole corrupt system that keep the sick ill as long as possible to make mega profits and take away any dignity left from dying people."

","Well ain't that a bummer...! You (Matthew McConaughey) work your ass off - quite literally, in this case - to deliver a career defining performance, only to have every other scene stolen from you by Jared Leto! And not just that - add to that the fact that Leto's performance seems so effortless, so natural, so born-to-play-this-role, one can imagine the experience of being so breezily upstaged would be almost more painful for McConaughey than his gruesome weight loss...!<br/><br/>I'm kidding of course, but it must be said that I was truly, truly impressed with Leto. His Rayon is mesmerising.
In any case, I'm very happy that both men received Oscars for their parts because they so well deserved them.<br/><br/>Also, Jennifer Garner deserves a mention for her gentle, understated performance. Here is not a glamorous Hollywood star, dishing out all she has in order to be noticed. This is a very real, true person - who, even if she didn't exist in real life, deserves to be where she is because it simply makes sense for her to be there.<br/><br/>This is quite a beautiful film, and its story needs to be told. I can only imagine the impact Ron Woodroof must've made in the lives of everyone around him, and so many people after."

","""Dallas Buyers Club"" is definitely worth the detour for this true and incredible story worn by Matthew McConaughey whose charisma sparkles! It is indeed all the internal evolution and also the physical evolution of this character, Ron Woodrooff, which is remarkable ... Evolution which is made throughout its fight against the disease and at the same time against the system put in place by the FDA ... His awareness that will lead him to change completely at all to find himself at the head this Buyers Club where another way to heal is possible, is quite phenomenal. Lost and HIV-positive individuals like him, will be able to take a little hope, which is also put forward to captivate us completely ... On the other hand, the relationship that is installed against all odds, between Ron and the young transvestite Rayon, is also interesting to follow to be very touching, very moving! In this regard, all the latent homophobia in the film takes on a very different dimension and color depending on the various protagonists of this story. Of course, there remains the whole financial and ambiguous aspect through the hospital, the doctors and these blind and destructive treatments by AZT, of which the FDA is the guarantor. In the end, a very beautiful film about this scandal updated in the United States in the 80s!"

","Matthew McConaughey is best known for staring in God-awful romantic comedies that no one likes.

After diagnosed with the deadly disease, he challenges the status-quo of the FDA, smuggling in life-saving drugs from around the world and forming his ppm sup[port group/medical organization. Perhaps what makes this performance so stunning isn't just the dramatic weight-loss required by the actor, but how his character isn't someone who you see in movies that much. A drunken electrician from Texas with Aids doesn't sell that often to studio executives, and it's refreshing to see a tale work so well with such an interesting lead character. Jared Leto is also terrific as a fellow Aids patient working with Woodroof.

"zkonedog","7","1","1","17 May 2017"," A Film For Breaking Down Conceptions & Boundaries
","Growing up in a conservative family, I was often sheltered from topics such as drug abuse and homosexuality. Out of sight, out of mind was the prevailing thought process in that type of upbringing. Upon getting educated and learning to think in my own terms, however, I've become much more open and understanding towards issue that may have slipped below my radar in years past. As such, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" was an eye-opening film for me for the way in which it allowed me an entrance point (via Hollywood drama) into some hard-hitting issues involving drug abuse, the gay community, and even the American health care system at large.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of real-life figure Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey), a very bigoted, prejudiced Texan who discovers (in 1985) that he has HIV. At first shocked and angry over even the association of having a ""queer's disease"", Ron eventually begins to accept his diagnosis and delves into the research on how to treat it. At first, he associates with medical doctor Eve (Jennifer Garner), who is hopeful about an experimental new drug yet to be sanctioned by the FDA. When Ron discovers that the drug may just as well be poisoning him, however, he begins his own treatment plan that leans heavily on non-sanctioned drugs from Mexico. Along the way, he meets Rayon (Jared Leto), who challenges many of his conservative beliefs about the gay community and just human beings at large.<br/><br/>I think ""Dallas Buyers Club"" works so well (and garnered so much acclaim) because of the fact that McConaughey & Leto's characters are basically direct conduits to many viewers. There are many people out there (and I'll still put myself in that group) who view homosexuality from a distance lens, and Ron Woodruff (in the character's initially stages) embodies that perfectly. Once he is forced to interact with that community (primarily through Rayon), he comes to learn that it isn't the ""big deal"" or taboo he once thought it was (a reaction that I think many people, including myself, have had as the gay rights movement continues to gain momentum). Director Jean-Marc Vallee hits all the right notes in crafting a story that is deeply emotional and can easily cross over into the lives of many viewers.<br/><br/>Only helping matters is the incredible acting. Leto utterly transformers himself into Rayon, while McConaughey continues his rather surprising late-career transition from ""king of the silly rom-com"" into a very accomplished dramatic actor. His physical transformation for the film is also quite stunning, reminding me of Christian Bale in ""The Machinist"". Clearly, these were ""all-in"" roles for him & Leto. Garner holds up her end of the story nicely, providing a presence who is caught in the middle of her chosen profession (medicine's) way of doing things and Ron's more free-wheeling style (that seems to be producing better results). When all is said and done, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" can be evaluated just as much as a film about the process of testing drugs for disease control as it can for anything else.<br/><br/>Simply put, I'm glad I ""took a chance"" on ""Dallas Buyers Club"", as it turned into a very good experience for me. Many people will dismiss the film because of its subject matter, but to do so would be to rob yourself of a cinematic & dramatic treat. To be completely honest, the only reason I'm not giving the film an even higher star rating is because I'm just so new to many of the topics touched on that in many cases I'm not even ready to put all the pieces together quite yet. The bottom line, though, is that I very much enjoyed the experience both literally (as a solid film) and personally (expanding my social & culture horizons)."

Together,they formed the ""Dallas Buyers Club"". <br/><br/>As mentioned,McConaughey provided a great character performance which could probably be considered his career best.This alone could be a reason to merit an excellent rating and great reason to watch the film.In addition to that,it is also a relevant film about the A.I.D.S. epidemic as well as the A.I.D.S. and H.I.V. virus that does not involve queers and gays alone.Finally,it provides the viewer lots of knowledge about the subject matter both in the past and the present about it."

Ron tries to beat the system to help other people with AIDS. A lot of the time, films with Oscar buzz tend to be highly overrated. I end up being disappointed more often than not. I was honestly expecting more of the same with Dallas Buyers Club. I couldn't have been more wrong if I tried. Not only does it live up to the hype, but it surpasses it. This is filmmaking at its finest. It had been a while where I felt so much emotion from a movie. Ron Woodroof won't be for everybody. He is abrasive and doesn't change who he is for anyone. He will test your patience and many people will be mixed on him. As much as I didn't like him at times, I couldn't help but respect his fighting spirit and his perseverance. His will to live was inspiring. He did a lot of bad things, but he also did a lot of good things as well. He even managed to evoke sympathy from me at times. He was polarizing and a fascinating character. Matthew McConaughey is truly impressive as Ron. He deserved his Oscar. I'm not all that familiar with Ron, but Matthew was phenomenal in the role. He hit all the right notes. Jennifer Garner is solid in her role. She's really improved over the years. Jared Leto steals the show at times. His incredible performance is right up there with McConaughey's. <br/><br/>This movie was extremely inspiring, moving, frustrating, heartfelt, among other things. It packs a wallop.

This unexpected event leads him to do whatever he needs to stay alive, and therefore, setting up the fore-mentioned 'Dallas buyers club' to get around FDA regulations in order to get access to efficient treatment for many suffering patients.<br/><br/>The movie itself contains dark humor and can be surprisingly amusing, especially when it comes to the relation Woodroof has with his transgender friend (Leto). This movie is a humanity lesson that's brilliantly taught by director Jean-Marc Vallée.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the overall aesthetic of the movie. This was one of the thing that hit me first. For a low-budget film, the director managed to make it look amazing. Editing, props, make-up are all perfect.<br/><br/>The performance of the actors is amazing, at least when you're talking about McConaughey and Leto. They both bring a lot of humanity to this movie and both have been through major physical appearance changes. They utterly deserved their Oscars nomination. The other performances, despite being intrinsically solid, may seem a little weak compared to the main character's.<br/><br/>Dallas buyers club could have been one of those average, cliché movies, but it is a masterpiece. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

","Beautiful. That is the one word I would use to sum up this movie. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto give performances that will be remembered for a lifetime. Both individuals were more than deserving for the rewards that they received. The film's cinematography, dialogue, and acting were all some of the best that I have seen. Yes, there are many vulgar and borderline repulsive scenes, but this helps display the effect that the director was aiming for. <br/><br/>One of the biggest things, for me, is the meaning behind this movie. The struggle of HIV and AIDs is such a major problem. This film was not just made for entertainment, good reviews, money, etc., it was made to show those who may be struggling with these terrible diseases that they are not alone. If you happen to catch Leto's Oscar speech, he hits the nail on the head. This was not for the actors, the producers, or the film industry. This was for those individuals dealing and suffering with this dilemma. My heart goes out to all of those people, and that is why my heart loves this movie so much. <br/><br/>Originally, I gave this film 9/10 strictly because I was trying to look upon it as a critics point of view, but my heart and my mind are saying ""forget the critics."" I love this movie, and it is easily one of my favorites. <br/><br/>10/10"

","Dallas Buyer Club is a fantastic movie and it's further proof that the McConaissance is indeed real. This movie explores important themes regarding the relationships between homosexuals/transgender people and heterosexual people. The movie shows that we are just humans and it does not matter our preferences. The movie is filled with fantastic performances and underneath the rough exterior of the film, it has a heart. It knows how to pull the strings of our emotions as there are some incredibly powerful scenes. This movie is about the growth of human beings and how we can achieve the impossible if we try.<br/><br/>Jean-Marc Vallee's film is based on the true story about a Texas cowboy named Ron Woodruff. He is diagnosed with HIV and he takes the news very hard. But with the help of a fellow HIV patient and a transgender named Ronny and a kind doctor named Eve, he decides to help him and fellow patients get proper treatment. The only problem is the FDA is the main enemy as they do not allow any of these drugs to be used. Now Woodruff must publicly battle the FDA to gain any hope of survival.<br/><br/>This film features not one, but two landmark performances. Matthew McConaughey might have delivered the best performance of his life as the foul-mouthed Ron Woodruff. Throughout the film, we see how the character change and how he accepts people he normally wouldn't have, thanks to Matt's strong performance. Jared Leto makes a very mesmerizing return to the big screen as the transgender, Ronny. His performance is just so powerful and so sad. Jennifer Garner also delivers the goods as Dr. Eva.<br/><br/>Overall, The Dallas Buyers Club is an incredible movie that takes place in a time where the AIDS crisis was at its height and everyone was racing to find a cure. Powered by two magnificent performances, this movie was a prime player for the awards season and luckily it got all the attention it deserved. It's funny how a film with such a small budget can reach great heights and soar above films with budgets ten times as much. This movie should serve as an inspiration for those fighting HIV or AIDS. This movie shows that we should never give up fighting, no matter the cost. I rate this film 9/10."
"clas_mail","9","1","1","27 December 2014"," Exceptional story
","In the age of CGI monsters and graphic novel superhero movies, it is refreshing to see that one can still make an exceptionally good movie with a $5M budget, and be rewarded with a few Oscars for it.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers club has started at the point that any movie is supposed to start: a good story. The complexity of the main character and the very peculiar string of events makes it very unlikely for such a wonderful story to be completely made up, although I'd sure as hell watch every movie of the writer that could. The fact that is based on real events, like in most cases, neither adds nor retracts anything from the merits of the movie.<br/><br/>To me, the outstanding aspect of this feature, is the unusual ethical complexity of the main character. We are faced with a guy who passes as pretty regular amongst his peers and a complete product of his environment. To most viewers' standards, I guess he's rather unlikeable. And the good thing is, the movie does not try to make him any more likable. It is a great directorial ability, to tell a story entirely made of facts, leaving all judgments to the audience. And it is interesting to see how, although staying true to himself, the character of Ron Woodroof undergoes a massive transformation.<br/><br/>His homophobia and his exclusively pecuniary motivations are shattered and in the course of his journey we discover his humanity coming out in full bloom from deep beneath multiple layers of social prejudice. And if it was for this aspect only, the movie would still be very good. But the story touches on a much greater number of ethically gray social aspects: the prejudices linking homosexuality with AIDS in the 80s and 90s, the interests of the pharmaceutical industry confronted with the interests of their clients, regulation of food and drugs and the fairness of outcasting or outlawing the unorthodox elements that dare to think outside the box.<br/><br/>It is how far outside the box Ron Woodroof dares to think that drives the story forward, and his ingenuity in always finding regulation loopholes is a big part of what drives the story forward. Funny how the producers chose a Canadian director for a movie that makes the FDA look so bad, thus completely fulfilling the cliché of horrible health care in the US. It is also scary to think that American directors would actually hesitate to take on the topic.<br/><br/>Quite a few memorable scenes in the movie, from the one when Ron forces his homophobic fried to shake his cross-dressing homosexual partner's hand to the one that nearly brought me to tears of the old homosexual couple donating their house to a cause that started as a profit driven enterprise and became the only hope of many hopeless cases. It is the reverse journey of the pharmaceutical industry and it shows the dangers of not including an ethical element in the development of commercial products.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure if Matthew McConaughey's performance is exceptionally good, or if it's just the weight loss and the make-up. He's rather hard to recognize, if that's any worth. And his posture and accent place him right in the heart of Texas, just like the character he's embodying, although this might actually be the merit of the casting director. I am sure he deserved his Oscar ahead of Christian Bale's American Hustle, although I'm curious to see what Bale would have made of this part.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Garner and this movie doesn't help her cause. She's good, granted, but she benefits from an exceptionally well written part.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is, I think, the revelation of the movie. I thought everything we feel for the character is entirely down to his acting. And by no means I would have expected this from him, the pretty boy with a pop star image playing Alexander the Great's sexual partner.<br/><br/>Griffin Dunne's Dr. Vass is a very interesting part and I would have loved to see it developed a bit more, especially in terms of motivation and awareness of own impact.<br/><br/>So that's my take on a movie I felt a strong urge to write about, most likely because of its ethical implications. Great story, great writing, great directing and quite possibly Matthew McCounaughey's best role so far. And despite his best effort in both, this movie is so much better than Interstellar it defies comparison. Possibly because it doesn't rely on expensive CGI. And it's 2D."

Starting with his socially illegal pleasure seeking ways in Texas this story takes a turn when he finds out that he has aids.How his hatred towards the Homosexual is deceased and he tries to make a better living for people affected by aids is what the movie is all about.This movie has a high degree of profanity,realistic characters and a and a blood curdling depiction of the hardships faced by patients.This is a treat to watch,although the thick cowboy accent might not be understandable for certain audience,the movie comes out Brilliantly."

","I rate movies very carefully, with lots of thought put into what digit I wind up settling on. For me to choose 9/10 says one thing: that this person, I, truly believe this film is worth that number (keep in mind that a 9/10 in the film industry is considered a home-run, not that professional film critics use methods such as a 0-10 numbers rating system I'm sure, but you know what I mean) based on a number of key elements. The casting is spot-on - this is the sort of role that Matthew McConaughey really sinks his teeth into and rides out all the way. First off, the A-list actor shed a whopping 38 pounds of himself to portray an HIV-AIDS patient, and secondly, his middle-fingers-up ""fuck y'all"" rodeo persona comes naturally to McConaughey it seems. Jennifer Garner, as usual, plays the squint-eyed, uptight female role, and plays it to a tee. Maybe she's like that in real life so it's not hard for her, or something. I'm not an overly- huge fan of Jennifer Garner, but she certainly has talent, no doubt about that. Jared Leto - I couldn't place him at first - does a phenomenal job portraying the role of Rayon, a trans-gender HIV-AIDS patient who partners up with Ron Woodruff (McConaughey) - at first, Woodruff is intensely homophobic and downright offensive-talking toward Rayon, but warms up to him, and eventually makes Rayon a business partner.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film - very moving, kept me sucked in all the way through. A very ""human"" film."
"GeoPierpont","8","1","1","18 November 2014"," Tragic Reminder of Not Too Long Ago
","I worked as an AIDS Hospice Volunteer in the 90's and seeing firsthand the despair and loneliness experienced by these victims helped identify with the characters portrayed in this film. Extremely moving story with exceptional performances provided an educational and inspiring vehicle for audiences worldwide.<br/><br/>The transformation of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto was alarming as they were nearly unidentifiable. The dedication to their craft seemed unhealthy and did not feel these extremes were necessary to convey the plot. Matthew's take on this role hovered on overly theatrical which sometimes invalidated the plight of his character. Tone it down darlin'. Leto on the other hand totally nailed Rayon and he sure does make quite an impression of beauty, tragedy, and compassion.<br/><br/>The availability of medical information on HIV/AIDS at that time was so restricted and limited, it was a testament of the will to survive that he overcame his death sentence for seven years. I am not aware of all the facts behind the scenes but know of many others with Chronic Illness who became their own advocate in researching treatments outside of conventional methods to pursue cures or improve quality of life. A sad disheartening statement is presented that demonstrates the divergent paths of Big Pharma and the lone patient desperate for help.<br/><br/>The LGBT community was extremely organized and powerful in achieving great strides to provide access to drugs that addressed this illness. I would have liked to see more of how they impacted the success of their plight for assistance however, the main character was not in this category so perhaps more emphasis would be inconsistent.<br/><br/>It was gratifying to see a gradual acceptance by a straight man of the LGBT community despite his profit motive. There is much room for improvement even at this date. <br/><br/>Overall, an inspiring look at one man's mission to overcome FDA, IRS, and DEA regulations to help his fellow sufferers. High Recommend."

","A racist cowboy who lives on the edge receives the awakening of his life during a 'routine' doctor's exam in the mid '80s. During a hospital stay Ron Woodruff, a sex-craved rodeo pro (McConaughey), is truly disgusted by - and ultimately befriends - his roomy, transvestite drug addict Rayon (Leto), all the while being treated medically, emotionally (and irreverently) by Dr. Saks (Garner). What happens during this fantastic emotional roller coaster is a bit predictable, but heart-warming in a tragic sense however is seriously informative along the way. I strongly suggest you watch this with a very close friend, as you will want to digest and/or discuss this movie to great lengths afterward."
"brchthethird","10","1","1","14 November 2014"," One of the best films of 2013
","Matthew McConnaughey gives the best performance of his career yet in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, the story of Ron Woodruff and his struggle to obtain medicine, legal or otherwise, for his AIDS. There was also outstanding supporting work by Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto, who played a transgender AIDS patient named Rayon. When the movie begins, we are introduced to Ron Woodruff, a hard-drinking, sex-crazed, racist and homophobic man whose life is falling apart. As time progresses, he makes a gradual change to becoming a man who values his (and others') lives more due to his illness. He is also a man who doesn't give up or give in, as evidenced by his multiple run-ins with the FDA and the DEA, and symbolized by the final frames of the film. And more than anything, that is what I think the movie is about: overcoming when the odds are against you. This is a powerful and moving story, based in fact, which deserved every award it received at the Oscars. Matthew McConnaughey, on somewhat of a winning streak lately, put in some of his finest work here and went the extra mile by making a significant physical transformation to inhabit the character and person of Ron Woodruff. Jared Leto also deserves mention in this regard for his transformation as well. Jennifer Garner also does well as Ron's doctor and (eventual) friend, one of the few people not afflicted with AIDS who sees his plight and tries to help him. Her performance was imbued with a certain kindness and gentleness which I found rather appealing. As far as technical qualities are concerned, Jean-Marc Vallee did a great job directing, the cinematography was excellent and I thought that the music was good as well. There's really nothing to complain about with this film at all. Sure, it might have been Oscar bait, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this was one of the best films of 2013."
"Rickting","8","1","1","28 October 2014"," Great acting. The rest of the film's not bad either.
","Mathew McConaughey has made an unexpected comeback after years of being something of forgettable roles, which has culminated in his Oscar win for this movie. Dallas Buyers Club, a story about a hustler trying to get medicine to AIDS patients after being diagnosed with the disease, is the kind of movie which would sink without good acting. This needs a good lead performance to carry the movie, and good supporting roles as well. Thankfully, DBC has both in spades. McConaughey pulls off a difficult role with great skill and conveys the character change and personality of Ron Woodroof brilliantly. Arguably even more impressive is Jared Leto as a trans woman with HIV, who steals the show. Leto's performance is without a doubt one of the best performances of 2013 and they both deserved their Oscars. DBC is an actors' movie, but don't let that make you forget it's also a very good film. Despite it's grim subject matter, unlike certain other films nominated for best picture this carries a sense of hope, and makes the film more powerful as a result.<br/><br/>The direction is very good, as is the script which mixes bleakness with hope and adds some humorous moments as well. DBC is in many ways a character study and it is an excellent one. There are many emotional moments but they all feel genuine and honest. DBC is a powerful and emotional film which may in many ways just be another drama, but it's moving and without a doubt worth watching for the acting alone. It's certainly not without its flaws. The humour occasionally feels out of place, certain characters feel like two dimensional antagonists and it has a somewhat clichéd framework. Dallas Buyers Club is not a ground breaking or massively striking drama; it is another drama film, but a very good one. I've seen 7 of the 9 2013 best picture nominees and this is the 6th best, although it's certainly above the over praised American Hustle. People won't really remember it too much in a few years and it isn't a film I would be interested in reviewing but it is a very good character study and I've very pleased to have seen it. Best of all, although it's got many depressing moments it is also quite uplifting.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Even though not a lot happens, this was still a really good movie. Mcconaughey definitely deserved the Oscar. However, I wasn't impressed by Jared Leto and don't know why he won all the awards. Just because he got skinny doesn't mean it's a great acting role.<br/><br/>The movie is about Ron, a cowboy that drinks, does drugs, and has random sex. He finds out he is HIV positive and is given 30 days to live. He decides to take his health care into his own hands and does what he can to get a hold of drugs that may help him. He goes to Mexico and gets thousands of pills. He starts up a business called the Dallas Buyers Club in which he gives the drugs to members. Basically, he is a drug dealer, sort of helping people, but also trying to make as much money as possible. He teams up with Rayon, since he can get him more customers and needs the drugs too. And Jennifer Garner plays the doctor that thinks AZT is not a miracle drug and thinks Ron is right for trying something different.<br/><br/>Ron lives longer than expected and sees the day the FDA changes its regulations by making drugs more available to dying patients.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A really good drama. Check it out."

","This is hands-down one of the best movies I have ever watched. Leto's amazing, McConaughey's amazing. A wonderful story that drags you through personal emotion and conflicts that resonate with today's society. Beautifully directed, brings up controversial subjects in regards to law-making authorities as well as gender issues. I don't have any more words to describe this movie, it really sells itself. The setting remains true to the theme of the movie. My only concern is the validity/truthfulness of the story in terms of how he accomplished his requested task. I believe this should have won over 12 Years a Slave because 12 years was supposed to be emotionally gripping, and I didn't sense that from those actors; but I did with DBC."
"professorharoldlloydhill","10","1","1","12 September 2014"," Jennifer Garner was snubbed for an Oscar Nod
","Dallas Buyers Club is not my kind of film. It's very hard to watch in some places, but what makes it so good are the performances. This has probably been said time and time again about this film and no doubt since two of the actors have won Oscars AND Golden Globes. McConaughey is almost unrecognizable, and a revelation as Woodroof. The hunky charismatic RomCom leading man is nowhere to be found here. Instead he is a hard drinking, smoking,womanizing slime-ball, who quite honestly deserves what he gets, AIDS. What the film does that I am not sure really happened is attempts to humanize Woodroof by giving him a companion in his drug buying business, a transvestite named Rayon, played by Jared Leto. Leto is also a revelation is this role. He plays Rayon with conviction and sensitivity, and at some points had me choked up. The relationship between Woodroof and Rayon becomes the main relationship of the film, and these two people really do come to care for each other. Jennifer Garner, as a sympathetic doctor who befriends Woodroof and Rayon is the other standout in this film, and personally i feel like she was snubbed for an Oscar nod. She has several standout scenes in the film, and holds her own with both Leto and McConaughey who are both playing at 100% at all times. Denis O'Hare and Michael O'Neill round out the cast as essentially villains of the piece, and each play their roles well too. O'Hare's character, a doctor, is only acting out of the fear and prejudice of the times, not knowing what AIDS is and what it can do. McConaughey's Woodroof is acting out of desperation, also for the same reasons, so obviously these two characters clash. O'Neill is an FDA agent who is determined to keep Woodroof down, but amazingly he perseveres. What this script does is take an unlikable man and humanizes him to make him likable and it succeeds. Somebody should have just given Garner an Oscar Nod!"
"victuki","7","1","1","27 August 2014"," Good Story and Performances
","Jean-Marc Vallée directed ""C.R.A.Z.Y."" in 2005, a family drama that became an instant cult movie. The performances, settings and music (there is a fantastic moment around Pink Floyd's ""Shine on Your Crazy Diamond"") made this movie special, and left no one indifferent. So when I found out Vallée was the director of this project, I got a good feeling about it. In addition, Matthew McConaughey, who has completely changed his style in every aspect (Please watch ""True Detective"" (Nic Pizzolato, 2014-) to know what I mean), a good cast and a story inspired by true events sounded really good. And it was an Oscar candidate already, so go figure. Matthew McConaughey is Ron Woodroof, an electrician and rodeo fanatic with a excessive and reckless sexual life. Eventually he contracts aids, a disease that back in that time was considered to be a homosexual-profile one. Without proper knowledge and treatments about it (it was still a new illness) he finds himself researching to extend his life, and by doing so he becomes a beacon of hope for many other people, whether affected by the same disease, like Rayon (great Jared Leto), or Dr. Eve, the doctor who treated Ron in the first place. This is a hero's journey, from the very hell to salvation, his own and many other's; this is a path of redemption, love and acceptance. The perception of life, every second of it, changes dramatically, and such story is worth telling every time. But I have to be honest here, and I can't stop wondering: Why is always this kind of movies the ones that get the Oscar? Again, as I said in the previous entry, I am not saying they do not deserve this or any other awards for this project. But I notice a tendency to be extreme melodramas the only ones to get this attention, and it bothers me. I like to think there are different stories, as good as these, or even better in some ways, so there is no need of dwelling on misery to tell a good story. As I said, kudos for the film, its great, but I feel that only for a change, films like ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""(Ben Stiller, 2013), or ""Amelie"" (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001) are also amazing stories, unique and touching, but it seems that optimism is not as artistic as drama nowadays. A real shame, but in the meantime, I rather daydream..."

","It is the mid-80s and the AIDS causing virus is swiftly become a concerning epidemic in America. Little is known about the disease, littler known is its treatment, and its latest victim is Ron Woodroof – a blue collar, hustler and straight-up Texas cowboy and he going out swinging hard, creating the Dallas Buyers Club.<br/><br/>At a time when HIV was poorly understood and research to treat the virus was slow moving, in part by the FDA, diagnosis was a death sentence. With a startlingly low 30 day prognosis, Woodroof is just bullheaded enough attempt to outlive his prognosis, by any means necessary despite the legal ramifications. Based on a true story, Dallas Buyers Clubs tells of Woodroof's quest for medication, bypassing regulation, by heading straight to Mexico. Along the way he sees a booming market of desperate people, and creates a members-only club with an unlikely business partner Rayon, a trans woman.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays the machismo Ron Woodroof and his casting could not be more on point. Who else can play a Texas cowboy than Hollywood's own leading man? His commitment to the character is obvious due to his physical transformation and withered frame of a deathly ill man. The role was made for him and that might be the problem – it feels like he is just being Matthew McConaughey with AIDS.<br/><br/>The real star of the film is the trans business partner Rayon. Jared Leto is pure and true in his portrayal of the trans Rayon, albeit a bit hokey. He is transcendent, there is absolutely not a drop of Leto visible, not for even a fraction of a second. Once Leto's character is introduced the movie takes a powerful step in the direction of captivating Oscar worthy cinema.<br/><br/>In less capable hands this story could have easily been sappy, bland, and straight-forward. Its lack of insipidity is thanks in part to the relatively unknown script writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack. and director of the film Jean-Marc Vallée.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","11 July 2014"," Brilliance of two actors
","Dallas Buyers Club received recognition in the form of both Academy Awards for Male Actors, both main and supporting, becoming the fifth overall and the first in over a decade to win both. This is fitting, seeing as the two award receivers in question, Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, do give some of the most grounded, real and hauntingly human performances seen in a while. This is their tale and the movie shines solely because of them.<br/><br/>It's mid-80s and AIDS hysteria is in full swing. No one knows what this new, terrifying disease is all about and no one expects the victims to live longer than a few weeks. History tells us that thousands simple wasted away in hospitals, hooked up to machines to alleviate their pain. But there were some who refused to give up, who went out and looked for cure no matter what. This is a story about one such man.<br/><br/>McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof beautifully. Outwardly and at first he's your typical Texas rodeo jock, full of swagger, empty promises and dirty innuendos. Yet as the movie progresses, you start to see the core of iron within him. You start, partly despite yourself, to appreciate his determination, his intelligence and his willingness to do what others will not or can not do.<br/><br/>Leto is certainly somewhat overshadowed by McConaughey's excellence, but his performance shouldn't be dismissed either. Rayon, a HIV positive homosexual works as a classic foil. He's the sensibility to Woodroof's bluster, the emotion to his logic, the inside view into a world Woodroof has previously dismissed altogether. Both are subtle and nuanced performances even though their characters are crude, vulgar and outlandish.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club will win you over with its plot, storytelling and most of all characters. It's one of those movies where you cannot really find any faults even though it might not otherwise become one of your favourite movies. Heavily recommended."
"brando647","8","1","1","2 July 2014"," Another Fantastic Turn from Matthew McConaughey
","As I mentioned in my comments for Ron Howard's RUSH, 2013 was a year full to the brim with great films inspired by true stories. From the Formula-1 raceways of RUSH, I moved forward nine years to the tale of one Texas man's battle with HIV and how he came to help others with the same affliction. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB was another film whose positive critical buzz drew me in. Quick bit about me: I'm not usually attracted to ""factual"" dramas because I know the plots are generally manipulated by the filmmakers to amp up the tension. Very few remain truly faithful to the source events and, based on what I've read about DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, it's no different. But I'm still a sucker for a good movie and I'd been reading about Matthew McConaughey's performance for a few months prior. It's the tale of Ron Woodroof (McConaughey), a Texas man's man who spends his days as an electrician and his nights chasing hookers and booze. When Woodroof begins suffering from dizzy spells and blackouts, he goes for a checkup and is informed that he's infected with HIV. Pretty nasty case, too, with a projection of only 30 more days to live. When he finally comes to terms with his condition, he tries to get into the hospitals drug trials for a new HIV treatment known as AZT. He's cast aside and refuses to give up, doing his research and finding new sources of experimental treatments from around the globe. Recognizing the potential to help others and make some serious cash, he starts the Dallas Buyers Club to distribute these drugs to other patients while he continues to dodge the ever-looming FDA who seeks to shut him down.<br/><br/>I don't know which elements of DALLAS BUYERS CLUB are true and which aren't, but I know that the story and characters, crafted by writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, are engaging. Everything you may have heard about Matthew McConaughey's performance is true. He's really given his career a much needed overhaul, going from generic romantic comedies to much more challenging roles in movies like KILLER JOE and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. I'd almost forgot he could actually act until last year. Woodroof is another character that doesn't fit the usual hunky goofball role he'd come to be associated with. At the start, Woodroof is thoroughly unlikeable. He's racist and homophobic. He's a perpetual drunk who loves hookers and gambling, and he embodies what most people probably imagine when thinking of a Texan from the mid-eighties. It was not a tolerant time. When he's thrust into the position of a social pariah, he manages to work past his prejudices and becomes a hero of sorts for those with AIDS and no means of managing their illness. His partner in crime is Rayon, a transsexual played by Jared Leto. Rayon is a colorful character and Leto's been getting a lot of attention for his performance. He really does a great job and disappears into the character (which isn't hard with the amount of makeup and costuming) but he didn't fully hit his stride until the second half of the film where Rayon's falling apart at the seams due to the virus as well as side effects from AZT treatment. When Rayon hits rock bottom, you start to see why Leto was so popular for supporting actor nominations.<br/><br/>When you stand DALLAS BUYERS CLUB against other ""factual"" films from the year, it doesn't quite achieve the same level of quality and I believe that to be the case because the story itself just isn't as interesting as those of RUSH or 12 YEARS A SLAVE. This movie is very much a character-centric piece and the plot sort of shambles along while McConaughey and Leto do their thing. When you boil it all down, it amounts to Woodroof finding innovative new ways of dodging the FDA regulations and the FDA catching up to him, throwing as many obstacles in his path as legally possible. As a result, the movie hasn't got a very smooth pace and the ending sort of sneaks up on you. Still, it paints a vivid picture of the AIDS epidemic of the eighties and serves as a reminder that pharmaceutical companies prioritize profits of saving lives. The film makes a devil of the FDA, as a soulless government agency that only cares for enforcing the rules without worrying about how it affects the population. Based on what I've learned of the modern food industry and the FDA's part in it, I'd wager to say much hasn't changed.<br/><br/>Accurate or not in it's portrayal of Woodroof's life and struggle, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is an inspiration. It's one of those films that comes along every so often to give us hope that one man can stand up and challenge government bureaucracy and make ripples large enough to affect the lives of millions. It's loaded with powerful performances (except for Jennifer Garnershe didn't pop as anything special amongst all the other more engaging roles). It's a powerful movie and serves as yet another example of McConaughey's strength as an actor. Check it out if you haven't."
"mrrockey","7","1","1","23 June 2014"," A Gripping, Powerful Film With an Amazing Lead Performance from McConaughey
","Dallas Buyers Club is one of those movies that could've easily turned into a schmaltz-fest had it fallen into the hands of a lesser director but thanks to a restrained, low-key style of direction from Jean-Marc Vallee, we get a powerful, gripping drama about the redemption of a man with AIDS. But why does it work? Let's find out!<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club tells the true story of Ron Woodwoof, an electrician and rodeo cowboy living a wild, crazy life in 1980's Dallas loaded with drugs, sex, gambling, and rodeo riding. Woodroof is a true Southern man, he is racist and homophobic and is not afraid to show it. It all changes one day, when he is diagnosed HIV+ and has only 30 days left to live. At first, he is in denial about it, but after doing a little research, he starts to believe that he really does have AIDS and tries to seek help at the hospital, only to have Dr. Eve tell him that there's no FDA approved drugs for HIV at the moment. So he bribes a hospital nurse for a drug called AZT to treat his condition but the drug ends up deteriorating his health instead. So he goes to a Mexican hospital where he is treated with two non-approved drugs, ddC and protein peptide T and they actually end up working for him. So he imports these drugs into the U.S. to sell them for other HIV patients.<br/><br/>Even though this has been stated a thousand other times in other reviews, I feel like I still have to say it, Matthew McConaughey is amazing in this film. His arc in the film going from a xenophobic, carefree rodeo cowboy to a caring, compassionate man who wants to help people of all races and sexuality is both touching and believable. He starts out actually quite unlikable in the film with his coke snorting, prostitute banging, money gambling lifestyle where he doesn't seem to give a sh!t about anything in life and has this bigoted worldview around him but throughout the film, we see him slowly change into a different person in a believable way. He develops a friendship with a transsexual named Rayon, he starts giving his drugs out for free(taking in membership fees instead), and starts doing it with CARE for people rather than just out of money. His standout scene is when he breaks down in his car, contemplating killing himself, it's a really powerful scene and towards the end of the film, you really do become attached to this character because of McConaughey's amazing performance.<br/><br/>But McConaughey's performance isn't the ONLY thing that's driving the film, it also has a lot to do with the direction. As stated before, this film easily could've been a schmaltz-fest, but Vallee goes for a very low-key, realistic style of direction that makes the drama have more impact than had if he gone all out with schmaltz. Vallee's direction is very minimalistic, he doesn't tell you how to feel for each scene, he just lets you experience it. There's no sappy score playing in the background, no super dramatic character moments, no emotional speeches, and no scenes that really try to tug at your heartstrings, the emotions in the film are very restrained. When a certain character dies in the film, he just dies. We never see him make any final words to Woodroof or have any character cry dramatically over his body. We DO see how people are affected by this but it's done in a realistic fashion where the tears are rough and angry. This may make the film sound COLD, but it actually makes the film ultimately more touching because it makes you feel like you're really taking a peak into someone's life and not watching a fabricated movie version of it, even though the film is highly fictionalized.<br/><br/>Another strength of the film is the script. A lot of movies featuring characters fighting against a system often portray the authority as very one-dimensional and cartoonishly rotten. Here, the writers were smart enough to treat the story with respect by portraying the authority realistically. They're not mustache-twirling villains, they're simply people who disagree with Woodroof's way of thinking and thinks that only drugs approved by the FDA should be allowed for public use. While we tend to side with Woodroof, the FDA never does anything that makes them really evil and make you hate them. I'm glad the writers didn't divulge into cliché Hollywood stereotypes of authority.<br/><br/>I've already praised McConaughey's performance but the rest of the cast is equally excellent. Jared Leto completely loses himself in the role of Rayon, leaving no trace of the actor behind. Not only does the makeup look convincing on him, he also walks, talks, and ACTS like a real transgender! If someone just came across a sneak peek of this film on their TV, they'd probably think Jared Leto really was a transgender in this film. I've heard a few people complain about Jennifer Garner's performance in this and while I'm generally not a fan of her, she actually does a good job in the film as Dr. Eve. Her conflicts with the system is actually believable and her romance with Woodroof is surprisingly effective. They have good chemistry on screen and their relationship together doesn't deride on silly Hollywood romance clichés.<br/><br/>Overall, Dallas Buyers Club is a gripping, powerful film with an incredible lead performance, restrained yet effective direction, a smart script, and a great supporting cast. 8/10"

","Review: This is an extremely well made movie about a man suffering from aids and who finds medicine that helps him love longer than presumed. The acting is amazing by all of the cast, especially McConaughey and Leto who deservingly won an academy award for there roles. The storyline is very well out together by the director, who draws you in to the movie right from the beginning to end. This is living proof that it's amazing what you can find out after a little investigation into the world of medication and the politics behind it. Anyway, the movie is quite deep so you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it, but it's very entertaining and an eye opener for anyone whose interested in this subject matter. Enjoyable! <br/><br/>Round-Up: McConaughey smashed this role to pieces. The whole weight lose thing, really did work for his character and the chemistry between him and Leto was brilliant. The film really did deserve all of the praise that it received from its audiences because the director added some wit to the deep subject matter. I know that this film won't be everyone's cup of tea, but you can't fault the amazing performances. I'm still amazed that it's a true story. It really does show how messed up politicians are. <br/><br/>Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $55.2million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there deep dramas about a man trying to find a cure to live longer with aids. 8/10"
"Kop_Reaz","9","1","1","7 June 2014"," Legendary Performance
","First thing comes to mind about this film is the performance of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Of course it's Oscar material that deals with AIDS, homosexuality and transgenderism of 80's. But those are not the reason behind the success of this film. McConaughey and Leto's legendary performances earned them big success in 2013's film awards. McConaughey in fact redefined himself.<br/><br/>The movie was inspired by true events. It shows the survival of real life AIDS patient Ron Woodroof. McConaughey portrayed Woodroof's character in the best way possible. Leto also played excellently the role of a HIV positive trans-woman Rayon. Beside them other artists did very well at their role.<br/><br/>The settings, score, script, makeup & hairstyle everything were perfect for a very good movie. Everyone involved in this film should be proud of their work. <br/><br/>Lastly, Things may have improved since 80's in USA, but third world countries can learn one or two things about AIDS from this film, that HIV is not the end. ""Dare to Live."""
"Kingpatel27","9","1","1","10 May 2014"," Great Film A Must See!!!
","A great film truly wonderful watch, great performances from Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner Films can be lifted by their performances, just as careers can be resurrected by the embrace of difficult choices. Though grounded by a resonant real-life story of struggle and survival, Dallas Buyers Club offers an example of both, Dallas Buyers Club can hardly be described as a comedy but the idea of a group of eccentric small-timers taking on the big bad bureaucrats has a comic resonance. This film also gives you and incite on how easily HIV can be caught and could effect someones life. Really recommend please watch as soon as you can if you haven't already."

","I really do. I was prejudging this movie from the trailer, to the start of the movie up till few minutes (about 20 minutes) into the movie. I don't usually like this kind of movies just because of the slow flow which this movie has. The scene by scene were a little bit longer than needed in my pre-judgement. I thought so up until I got sucked into the story, lost my pre-thoughts, and was then just feeling every emotions that the story were relaying. And then I realized how powerful those scenes were and how important they were to create the mood and feel for the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I really enjoyed it and liked it from beginning to the end.<br/><br/>If leaving a review requires criticism, the one and only thing I could think of were...<br/><br/>Jared fell out of character a couple of times in the movie, which isn't anything bad but I see everyone leaving criticism so I thought I have to leave at least one also.<br/><br/>Other than that, the entire movie is just powerful.

","'I still got HIV?'<br/><br/>The naivety forged in that one line alone has made me regain my faith in McConaughey, he has my respect as an actor again.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1985 with the news of Rock Hudson being treated for HIV in a Paris hospital (on a newspaper dated July 25th; Hudson died on October 2nd, same year) and his sexual preference.<br/><br/>'D'ya hear Rock Hudson was a cock sucker?'. 'All that fine Hollywood pussy just bein' wasted on a guy who smokes his f*cking friends.' - McConaughey spews those lines with pristine hate and disgust. This is where we begin to understand Woodroof.<br/><br/>Back in the Eighties the disease was widely associated with homosexuals and bisexuals. It was perceived to be contained within the latter community. AIDS was taboo, it still is and this film tells us the true story of Ron Woodroof; a rodeo, a hustler and a promiscuous drug addict whose discrimination against gay people and racial slurs are as potent as a Black Mamba's bite.<br/><br/>As we move on we sense the red-tape, the payoffs and the FDA regulations, which bar better and safer medicines to help AIDS patients lead normal life compared to patients being treated (still) with AZT; a prescription drug that gives temporary relief and an earlier death by decreasing the T cells and the overall immunity of the body. Woodroof heads to Mexico to smuggle in the safer, more effective medicines. The immigration interrogation scenes are ingenious.<br/><br/>Jared Leto has always been one of my favourite underdogs, right from 'Requiem for a Dream, 2000' to 'Alexander, 2004' and now this. His range is wide and carries a sense of mysterious sensuality with it. Oliver Stone realised that. In 'Club', Leto is brilliant, confident and quite appropriately dressed for the part that he pulls off as smooth as a hustle hand. He also made a cameo in 'Fight Club (1999)'. What are the chances of that?<br/><br/>As Woodroof develops full blown AIDS, he changes. The change is shown in many ways. The film reaches out to us and simply tells us how and what is it like on the other side of sunshine.<br/><br/>As Woodroof's entrepreneurship grows it faces prosecution from the FDA, the IRS and the police but it also gives people time to live 'normal' lives. A once hardened country-boy, cowboy will always be that, even if the odds are perpetually against him.<br/><br/>Rediscover McConaughey and revel in the tale of one determined son of a bitch who, by the end, is frail and exhausted yet he puts on his aviators, grabs the long braided ropes on the bull and dives right into the deep of saddle bronc riding; however, not before a slight nod that he slips into the scene. A nod that stays with you for a long time."
"bravesfanc","7","1","1","8 April 2014"," Deserved the Oscars
","This has been reviewed quite a bit so all I'll say is that if you were on the fence about watching the film, just do it. The acting alone is fantastic and both actors deserved the awards they won. I didn't know about this story until I watched the movie. It's a sad story but also kid of uplifting.<br/><br/>I don't think I would watch it again, and I say this because as good as it was, it was depressing and dark. It was amazing that when he first finds out he has the virus he's told he has 30 days to live. He ends up living for another 7 years. Awesome on his part and even though what he was doing was technically illegal it was all for a greater good, even though he was profiting from it.<br/><br/>Again, I think if you're not sure about watching it, just do it."
"cinematic_aficionado","8","1","1","1 April 2014"," A standout movie
","The struggle of a dying man. You have 30 days to live, so what do you do? Bypass the system and come up with a cure for an incurable disease. The film deals with an emotional theme about an impossible struggle undertaken by an ordinary man.<br/><br/>A free spirited Texan is diagnosed with HIV and is given a month to live. In response he refuses to acknowledge his downfall and discovers a fault in the system's dealing with such cases thus trying a cocktail of medication which defies all the odds.<br/><br/>What makes this film great (and it is one of the great recent ones) is the lack of a 'wow moment' or any sort of extraordinary reversal of circumstance. Instead we partake in a man's struggle with death. He knows its coming sooner than expected but his unyielding spirit refuses to let him give up of be content. He wins the battle for life, a day at a time and cannot ask for more.<br/><br/>It is also very upsetting to observe how ""the system"" refuses to acknowledge an alternative way and because of financial incentives continued supporting a way of managing HIV that was plainly inadequate. Another encouraging outcome of the situation Ron Woodrof faced is to quell an attitude that one could effortlessly describe as homophobic.<br/><br/>Emotional and a roller-coaster of situations where the fighting spirit shows its true might."
"lahirimoy","8","1","1","1 April 2014"," Sterling movie with masterly performance.
","In Short- 'Ain't nothing out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in 30 days'.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that Matthew McConaughey will win an Oscar for the best actor? Then you watch Dallas Buyers Club and you realize the benchmark he has set for other actors. And then we get to watch his small role in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and the very dark and thrilling 'True Detective (TV Series)'. Watching him from his 'A Time to Kill' days, he has really grown as an actor and outdone himself many a times throughout his career. He surely deserved an Oscar. Nobody could have justified the role of Ron Woodroof more than him. <br/><br/>Not mentioning Jared Leto's performance will be a failure as a reviewer and a misdemeanor as a avid movie goer. He aced the character of a trans-gender woman who is dying of AIDS( a role which must have been very tough to play but he made it look a piece of cake ). <br/><br/>The shades of gray that have been written into the script make the characters seem more real. AIDS connect them and puts them in the final journey of self-discovery. The film very aptly depicts the stigma attached to AIDS. And also delineates the die hard human spirit and the dignified portrayal of survival against astounding odds. <br/><br/>Finally, the Direction is brilliant. Generally, 'Based on true story' tag has been used extensively and hence, has worn out the attention of the viewers. So, nowadays it is more challenging to use this tag and to keep it at that, but Jean-Marc Vallée simply aced it. This film will definitely boost up the spirit of many patients, give them hope and make them strong. A must watch. <br/><br/>Welcome to The Dallas Buyers Club."

","From the opening scene, watching Matthew McConaughey show his chops as the emaciated rodeo cowboy who finds out he has AIDS, I couldn't take my eyes away from this movie. Of course, it's not because it's fun to watch. The development of his character as he parades his homophobia to where he is made to realize what gay people face every day, particular in a historical context at the height of the epidemic that shook the world. There is a personal and a social justice issue portrayed here. The villains here are the federal agencies. Unfortunately, Hollywood does tend to single out someone or something to direct it disdain. In reality, when faced with this epidemic, there was a lot of confusion as to how to treat it and while it is sad that they stood in the way of approval of some drugs, they really did have a job to do. Desperate people do desperate things. But oversight really was necessary. That said, it doesn't matter. McConaughey's performance, along with that of Jared Leto, make this one of the most intensely character driven movies I've ever seen."
"Bob-45","9","1","1","30 March 2014"," Great movie. More importantly, great message about the FDA
","""Dallas Buyers Club"" does not fit in my usual tastes of subject matter. I saw it primarily because of Matthew McConaughey, who has evolved from a ""caterpillar"" to a ""butterfly"" over the last 15 years. I hated McConaughey in ""Contact,"" tolerated him in ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Failure to Launch,"" but loved him in ""Reign of Fire,"" ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" ""The Paperboy,"" ""Killer Joe,"" ""Magic Mike,"" ""Mud"" and this movie. Imagine my surprise when I discovered Jared Leto's fine performance AND the GREAT message about the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Rockefellers CREATED the FDA as a shill for ""Big Pharma"". The FDA harasses, threatens or outright outlaws alternative medical treatments, which could save live. The FDA usurped this power; it has NO power to do so and is not even Constitutional. Recently the FDA ordered the REMOVAL of natural Statin from Red Yeast Rice, even though natural Statin is SAFE, unlike the Statin drugs used to lower cholesterol. Independent studies can measure the efficacy and safety of drugs; and alternative medical treatments and natural products can safely replace MOST prescription drugs. A board-certified MD, who practiced alternative medicine three days a week, once told me, ""If you had AIDS, I could cure it. However, if I did, I would lose my license and go to jail."" THIS is the legacy of the FDA. By the way, during the time period of this movie, the NEW YORK TIMES reported French doctors were CURING AIDS by passing a patient's blood through tubes exposed to ultraviolet light.<br/><br/>I also need to mention the fine performances of both Jennifer Garner and Griffin Dunne, who play sympathetic doctors, one of whom has lost his license over prescribing non-approved treatments. I gave this movie a ""9"" instead of a ""10"" because the last quarter tends to drag and the ending feels a bit flat. However, the message is so important, and the performances so fine, I urge every adult to see ""The Dallas Buyers Club""."
"downie-pat","9","1","1","28 March 2014"," Best film of 2014 so far
","Engaging and sensitive film about a topic that isn't often portrayed on the big screen. McConaughey gives the performance of a lifetime and has obviously done some serious slimming in order to play the part.<br/><br/>Ron - the main character starts off as a dodgy low life but by way of his misfortune makes his hustler talents work for him and others. The fight against the Food & Drug Agency is fascinating and insightful showing how corporations through corruption will forego human life for profits. <br/><br/>This was a film that made me think and reflect at the end of it which for me indicates a worthwhile cinema experience."
"yris2002","8","1","1","28 March 2014"," Great picture. Well-deserved Oscar for Matthew McConaughey.
","This is of course not the first movie dealing with aids and aids-related issues, and Dallas Buyers Club shares with them a very sharp touch, when brutality becomes necessary in order to keep credibility and authenticity. This picture is brutal, from beginning till end, brutal in scenes, dialogues, faces, gestures, but also keeps a very strong and touching sense of humanity, and this is what makes it a great picture, it oozes humanity from every pore, with a sense of authenticity which gives gooseflesh. And the greatly acting cast contributes to a fleshy and yet soulful performance. At last, Matthew MacConaughey has been given the opportunity to prove to be a talented actor, and the academy promptly recognized this matter of fact. He is definitely the central and driving force of this strong movie and his performance proves mesmerizing both in his strong and frail moments. Of course his weight loss proves impressive in contrast with his usual sex-symbol image, but what impresses is not just the physical impact but also his authentic acting, which makes him a real character and puts he drama of the story brutally and realistically in front of our eyes. It would be unfair not to mention the bravura of the other characters, especially Jared Leto, whose performance was really touching and heartfelt."
"nadalnam","9","1","1","27 March 2014"," It was no less than superfluous
","The blend of emotion and sophistication was displayed by the phenomenal actors McConaughey and Leto. The amount of dedication that they exhibited simply cannot be disregarded. The weight loss is simply just the frosting of their dedication, but their dedication is illustrated in their roles. McConaughey acted as a discriminating HIV positive male who fought for his life against the FDA, while Leto acted as a trans-gender female prostitute who was also HIV positive and was discriminated. Also, they won an Oscar each for their roles. The inspirational storyline and acting simply states that this movie is worth every second of your time."

","I had high expectations of this movie and so I am glad it did not let me down. Kudos to McConaughey, because after years of watching him in romantic comedies as a golden haired hunk, I had no problem buying him as the gritty Ron Woodroof. He was very convincing in the role, as was Leto in his. It tackles a dark subject with just enough humor to make it watchable, yet serious and, ultimately, optimistic. What impressed me the most was that in the few touching scenes, they didn't go the traditional We-will-do-just-about-anything-to-make-you-tear-up Hollywood route, and kept it free of melodramatic and cringe worthy exchanges. <br/><br/>All in all, it was interesting and entertaining."
"bkoganbing","9","1","1","24 March 2014"," ""Remember it's a business""
","Dallas Buyers Club is a film about those rough days in the middle 80s during the heights of the AIDS epidemic. I lived in New York City in those days and for two decades lost innumerable friends and loved ones to this plague which attacked the human body's immune system. The plague started in New York and San Francisco and both cities with a large LGBT population which had its struggles with indifference in government, but generally had the good will of the populace. That was what would become the heart of blue state America.<br/><br/>But this story as its title says takes place in the heart of the reddest of states. Matthew McConaughey is an electrician and part time rodeo bull rider who lives a swinging lifestyle of unprotected sex and liberal drug use. Ways certainly we know AIDS can be acquired, but back then the religious right hawked for it was worth that AIDS was the ""gay disease"". Just stop being gay and AIDS will cease, no need for government reaction to the epidemic.<br/><br/>McConaughey starts out thinking exactly that way, he can't conceive that a good Ole Boy like himself could get a disease reserved for homosexuals. His friends think the same way and pretty soon he's shunned by his fellow rednecks. <br/><br/>But after he's told that he has maybe 30 days to live, that's something he just won't accept. He also research's promising drugs and non- pharmaceutical remedies to deal with the virus. He's fought every step of the way by the pharmaceutical establishment because as we are told by Dr. Denis O'Hare it is a business first and foremost.<br/><br/>McConaughey is nothing if not resourceful. In the process he acquires a whole new set of friends including his doctor Jennifer Garner and a transsexual AIDS patient Jared Leto. McConaughey finds that fighting the disease takes a lot more fortitude than riding bulls. His evolution of mindset is what got him his Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Jared Leto received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for transforming himself in just about every way possible. The contrast between McConaughey and Leto is also a lot of what drives Dallas Buyers Club. Leto's homosexuality and cross dressing have alienated him from his wealthy family. He keeps feeding his drug habit, having a lot of unprotected sex because even if he's cured he feels he has no reason to live and no one to care about him, not even family. Family rejection is a powerful thing to overcome, a lot can't do it. I've seen enough in my own life with people I know and still know in terms of family rejection. It's the biggest obstacle, the fear of family rejection to coming out. Leto shows how real that fear is and how some just can't deal with it. So many broken bodies because of the disease have broken souls within. Unless you are a hardcore Tea Party follower you will be moved to tears by what Leto does with the part.<br/><br/>Besides those Oscars, makeup naturally won an Oscar both for Leto's and McConaughey's transformation to diseased people. It's also a testimony to the dedication of so many AIDS activists even those who came from strange places like Matthew McConaughey's character."

McConaughey played the role of a man with AIDS and his rebirth in a perfect and touching way. We see the fall of a man who couldn't understand the real value of his life and who couldn't appreciate people different from him, and, after that, the rise of a new man who doesn't give up and, through sufferings, understand the real value of life, friendship and respect."

","Dallas Buyers Club is a game changer for law budget movies which proves that a good story doesn't need a big pile of money to make it great. <br/><br/>The first reason why I say that is Matthew McConaughey. If you had any doubt that he is a top-notch actor, this is your last chance to change it. Not even for a second I felt that I was watching Matthew, but instead Ron Woodroof. The rest of the cast was amazing, especially Jared Leto, who impressed me deeply. Playing a transsexual character is no easy job, but he delivered an outstanding performance which I believe will stick with me for a long time.<br/><br/>The rest of the credit goes to writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack. An unfinished or unpolished story destroys a low budget movie. But likely this is not the case of Dallas Buyers Club.<br/><br/>What I like the most about Dallas Buyers Club is the fact that all characters are three dimensional and it is up to you to decide who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. This kind of freedom is a prefect example of giving you pretty much free choice of your opinion. After all this is most important aspect of a movie."

They genuinely transform into these characters, these people, which is a rare thing — even among the best actors. Thankfully, the movie isn't just all about the acting. It's also a great story. <br/><br/>Based on true events, Dallas Buyers Club — directed by Canada's own Jean-Marc Vallée — is about Ron Woodruff (McConaughey), a homophobic drug abuser diagnosed with AIDS. Told he has 30 days to live, he scrambles to extend his life and eventually finds help in an FDA (Food and Drug Administration)–unapproved pharmaceutical drug in Mexico. He decides to smuggle the drug into the United States. With the help of a transgender woman (Leto) whom he increasingly befriends, he sells the dugs to HIV-positive patients. But as more and more people turn to him for help (and he becomes more compassionate along the way), he starts to face the wrath of the FDA, forcing him to fight the system — not so that he can keep making money, but so he can help those, like himself, in need.<br/><br/>It's the kind of inspirational story that Hollywood can often do so well — where one person stands up and fights the system for what's right. It's a really well-done, classic David and Goliath tale that you become invested in and root for.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean Dallas Buyers Club is all upbeat, of course. It's a harrowing, emotional movie about AIDS, after all. But, like life, the movie is a balance of a lot of things. It's inspiring and maddening, heartfelt and sad, funny and serious. It also balances a mix of different kinds of stories. <br/><br/>It's a character study. It's a look at how people can completely change. It's an underdog story. It's an exposé of the problems with the FDA. It's a look at how awful AIDS can be.<br/><br/>But what's most inspiring about the movie isn't just its theme that anyone can make a difference. It's that a selfish, hateful person like Woodruff can do a 180 to become the kind of noble person who genuinely wants to make a difference by helping people. Dallas Buyers Club is an emotional film for a lot of reasons, but the biggest reason is the idea that everyone deserves to live a good life and enjoy what life offers. Sometimes that means doing whatever it takes to make that happen — whether it's for ourselves or for others."

","Finished up Dallas Buyers Club with the wife & I gotta say, we both loved it. McConaughey & Leto were outstanding. Just absolutely amazing. Now I see why these gentleman won the awards they did. Such a moving, thought provoking piece. Just fantastic work all around. I have to say, seeing Matthew in a role like this is awesome. Between this and his work on True Detective he is really coming into his own. Something this writer always thought was possible and is long overdue. More performances like this from either actor and your looking at the 2 next all time great actors. I'm 32 and was just a baby when the outbreak of Aids occurred in the early 80's. It was hard to see how people were treated that had the virus no matter there sexual orientation."

","Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey) is a Dallas electrician, who gets the HIV virus in 1986, and he's given 30 days to live by the doctors, who treat him in a local clinic. Ron tries to get into an experimental trial for AZT, an experimental drug that treats HIV, but is rejected for the trial. Undaunted, Ron buys all the AZT he can on the black market, but his eyes are opened when he goes to Mexico, and is treated by Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne) who treats Ron with a cocktail of vitamins and drugs that the FDA hasn't approved yet. Ron gets the idea of going into business with a transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto) who Ron met at the hospital. The business involved Ron smuggling illegal drugs from Mexico, and opening up the Dallas Buyers Club, which offered members drugs in exchange for a 400 dollar membership fee.<br/><br/>The government learns of Ron's activities and soon the FDA, and IRS are trying to shut down the Dallas Buyer Club, but Ron is as tenacious as a man facing a death sentence can be. Ron sues the FDA, for access to these unapproved AIDS drugs. Does Ron win his lawsuit? How long does he live after only being given 30 days to live? <br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie,not because everybody holds hands and sings Kum Bayah, but because it perfectly encapsulates the mood of people in the 1980's about AIDS. The mood in one word was a mood of fear. People were dying of an unknown disease, most commonly linked with gays, and everyone was afraid. The people who had AIDS didn't want to die, and would do anything to prevent from being a statistic, and the people who didn't have AIDS, didn't want it, and didn't want to associate with people who had AIDS. It also shows how Ron Woodruff, initially in denial, really did his research on HIV medications, and really tried to help others live. Thismovie is not perfect, there is a moment where it spouts statistics and sounds like an after school special, and the movie is a bit long overall. In the final analysis, Dallas Buyers Club rises above cliché because of the remarkable performances of McConaughey and Leto.<br/><br/>McConaughey gives a powerhouse performance, he is unapologetically homophobic, and racist, but his pure survival instinct forces him to associate with gays and others that he probably wouldn't associate with in order to live another day. He never quite loses his taste for bad habits, drug use, prostitutes, and that makes his character all the more real. Leto is a perfect counterpoint to McConaughey, kind and gentle, even giving MConaughey's character a leg massage when his calf gets cramps. There is a heartbreaking scene featuring Leto, I will not give it away but it is his best scene in the movie. They both deserved their Oscars. Jennifer Garner was pretty good, I wouldn't say she held her own, but she wasn't bad, and even had a memorable scene of her own.<br/><br/>The story is a bit long, the pacing is a bit slow at times, but those are minor flaws, in a very good film.<br/><br/>To join an exclusive club, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com."

","If it's not because of great performance from it's leading actor, 'Dallas Buyers Club' would be a failure and forgettable. Luckily, Matthew McConaughey responds the challenge confidently and even beyond it. He really portrays Ron's character as a stubborn selfish person who try to survive from AIDS. Undeniably Matthew McConaughey is flawless and no wonder he is appreciated with an Oscar from his performance in 'Dallas Buyers Club'. He shows commitment on acting as a professional actor by transforming his body and give an all-out performance. Not forget to mention Jared Leto who also steals attention as Rayon. Overall 'Dallas Buyers Club' is inspiring and strong in storyline but it felt boring sometimes in some scenes."

","I watched this movie some time ago when it first came out and after seeing the performances of the actors I knew they would win it all. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's performances are the best of their careers and should be known as the best out of most actors careers as well. Their amazing transformations of their looks and their personalities are unbelievable. Any actor who's willing to take on such a daring and taboo role deserves recognition. <br/><br/>Jared Leto's character is a role most actors wouldn't dare act because he plays a transsexual which is still a choice that is an issue to many people so most would be afraid of the consequences. Jared brought amazing talent's into realizing this character and made their role so powerful yet at some instances his character brought the lighter enjoyable and even happy moments of the movie. <br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey finally went out of his sappy romance movies and showcased his talents which you have not seen since ""A Time To Kill"", he deserved the Oscar for best actor because he gave it his all to show such character development in his character, to give us a character whom at first we despise and in the end we love is something very difficult yet he did.<br/><br/>Not only do I congratulate the actors for taking on roles on a subject very rarely talked about; the Aids ""plague"" as some say but I thank the producers for producing this movie and having the guts to put this out there to the public. While some may say this is like ""Philadelphia"" it is not, this movie while it's about the HIV epidemic of the 80's it's also about the personal journey it's victims go through and in particular how it can change a homophobic close minded character into someone who's really human.<br/><br/>While this may not have any car chases, it brings you through ups and downs in these characters lives, their relationship with each other, their hopes and sorrows. It shows you almost a first hand experience on what it's like to live with Aids and how it effects people. It will make you see others differently, maybe even make you care about those you love more because it shows you the good and the evil people can be subjected to the same disease and disease can happen to anyone. Great meaning, acting and script. This year's best!"

","Make no mistake about it, this is NOT your typical AIDS movie. Those of you who are all caught up with that hype should just stop reading and go somewhere else. Dallas Buyers Club is a deeply upsetting but masterfully crafted piece of genius filmmaking. I have never felt so sorry for any movie character quite like Ron Woodroof. He's a flawed cowboy who's made a few too many mistakes that ends up putting his health in fatal jeopardy. The odds are not in his favor, but he has time to kill, and he makes up for it by selling an illegal drug that prolongs the lifespan of the average AIDS patient. Enter, the Dallas Buyers Club. His partner is crime is a transsexual named Rayon played by Jared Leto, who flirts his life away, but all in hopes of becoming a beautiful woman. The fact is, McConaughey and Leto give the performances of their lifetime. While I don't think this was the movie that deserved their Oscar, I can proudly say that it is the best performances they've done to date and that is deserving enough of the award. The story is also very engaging, fueled with Jean-Marc Valee's unprecedented direction. He's practically the next Darren Aronofsky. This is an urgent, meaningful movie and It deserves your time in watching it."

","Saw it on DVD. It is set in Dallas during the 1980s but filmed in New Orleans. In fact near the end when Ron is driving and gets out of his truck, it is under the ramps to the New Orleans bridge to the West Bank, and one sign even shows it to be an on-ramp to I-10. <br/><br/>The film was nominated for a number of awards and Matthew McConaughey in the lead role of Ron Woodroof won the Oscar for best actor. To prepare for the role of a man with AIDs he lost a reported 30 pounds for the shoot. And watching the film I can see why he won the award. <br/><br/>Jared Leto also does a fine turn as Rayon, the homosexual cross-dresser who became a partner in Ron's business to distribute medicines, which became known as the Dallas Buyers Club. The deal was each ""member"" paid $400 a month to be in the club and the medicines were free. Leto also won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role.<br/><br/>I always like seeing Jennifer Garner and here she is Eve, a doctor that treats Ron when he first is hospitalized, and who later becomes sympathetic to his cause. <br/><br/>The credits say the characters are fictional but certainly Woodroof was a real person and this movie tells his story. He really was diagnosed in 1986 and given only a few months to live, but in fact lived an additional 6 years. He attributed that to the medicines that he took, sourced from many places around the world, rather than rely on the ""approved"" treatments of the time."

","The opening sequence of Dallas Buyer's club speaks volumes about what to expect and the film doesn't disappoint.Every movie relies on one strong aspect and Dallas Buyer's club is an out an out actor's movie. It has a solid story line and a crisp narrative but its the performance that the lead and the supporting actors bring to the table that make it a memorable journey. Matthew McConaughey comes up with the performance of a lifetime and keeps you engaged with his portrayal of a Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof. Its the way in which his character goes through the transformation over the three acts of the movie and how his motivations change over the course of the film makes you root for him. The change in motivation and the subtle way in which he goes through it is something that stays with you long after the the film has ended. The first thing that comes to mind after watching Matthew McConaughey is that this guy deserves an Oscar for it and the fact that he got one just goes on to prove that this is THE BEST performance of the season. Jared Leto in the supporting role of cross dresser Rayon is equally engaging. Jared has owned the character and takes you on such a emotional ride that you feel for his pain. Jared portrays the inner conflict of Rayon, his insecurities and fear with such conviction that you are moved to your core another well deserved Oscar performance that was rightly won. Jennifer Garner does justice to her part but there is hardly anything that she could do here, but gets overshadowed by the other actors. The story of the movie is crisp and the brisk pace at which the narrative progresses just makes the film much more enjoyable. It helps that the film is based off real events and that it questions the medical system, but at its core its a story of one man standing up for what is feels to be true, his zest to survive and his journey to realize that there is more to life than money. The narrative does loose its steam at times and the direction though adequate is not at par with the script or the performances of the actors.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies which stays with you long after you have left the movie screens and the performances come back to you even after years."

","In 1985, the is somewhat a true story. The characters Eve (Jennifer Garner) and Rayon (Jared Leto) are fictional characters created to enhance the story. There are many inaccuracies in here regarding Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) and if you want to know the real scoop you need to do a keyword search on Ron Woodroof or do Wikipedia. This was done for the purpose to make people aware of AIDS and for entertainment. However, AIDS is still a serious problem.<br/><br/>I don't think I have ever watched a movie whereby the main character is so fully invested into the character he is playing as McConaughey is playing Ron Woodroof. He deserved every bit of the Best Actor Oscar. But, truth be told, he should have won that award long ago for other movies he was in. But, that's just me. <br/><br/>We are introduced to Ron as a gambler, sex addict, boozer andwell you name it. The opening scene has him performing a sex act at a rodeo with a scene of bull-riding in the background. Later in almost the very next scenes, we see an orgy and with threesomes thrown in. You see some nudity but everything else is up to your imagination. <br/><br/>Then, Ron Woodroof contracts AIDS. He goes from denial, anger, thoughts of suicide to finding a drug that will cure him. He goes to Mexico where he learns that the experimental drug AZT causes severe side-effects including death and he is shown alternative medications. And, they work. It is here he decides to stock up on these meds and ""sell"" them to other AIDS people across the border. He establishes the Dallas Buyers Club.<br/><br/>Ron's confrontations with FDA and Border Control Officials are somewhat suspect as presented in this movie, and just when we think he will be arrested, the next scenes show him back in Dallas taking care of his new business. So there is a lot we are not told regarding these border crossings and FDA battles. <br/><br/>Transvestite Rayon (Jay Letto) becomes Ron's friend and helps with the business. Letto received the Best Supporting Actor Award.<br/><br/>So you know what is going on, but it is in the telling that brings all this to light. The telling is informative and spectacular as you are riveted not knowing what is coming next. Great acting by all, especially by McConnaughey whose dialogues are spot on.<br/><br/>This is real stuff, There is real pain in being hurt, shunned, and living a life quite alone. I don't like to see people in pain regardless of the cause and even though this is ""just a movie"" everything you see has happened to people with AIDS. ""There is nothing new under the sun"" Pain is pain. See?<br/><br/>At the end of the movie there is a statement that AZT strength was reduced and turned out to actually save millions afflicted with AIDS. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Drug Use: Yes. Language: Yes."

","Dallas Buyer Club is so far, the best role Mathew McConaughey has ever performed but not only that, it is also a tribute to those pioneers who fought the AIDS in the late eighties and a fierce criticism to the American health system, where sometimes it seems that industry regulators set everybody's interest aside, in favor of a small group of companies. The movie leans on the terrific performances of Jared Leto and Mathew McConaughey, the transsexual and the taught bull rider, two antagonist characters who can't stick together in the beginning but eventually, they end up forming a solid duo. The metamorphosis suffered by Ron Woodroof as AIDS pops in his life is not only physical, sickness also transforms his mentality to make a leader of himself on behalf of fair regulations for medicines and chemicals. Thus, eventually one ends up with the feeling that Ron was not simply a bull rider, alcoholic and homophobic but one of the best examples of the critical mass in the US"

"blanche-2","8","1","1","28 February 2014"," AIDS in the '80s
","If you watched your friends die of AIDS in the '80s, you will have an emotional connection to Dallas Buyers Club, which is the true story of the rebellious Ron Woodroof.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays Woodroof, an electrician, homophobe, womanizer, and rodeo rider, who is diagnosed with AIDS in 1986 and given a month to live. At the time, the only drug available was AZT, which did not help Ron. He then starts seeking other treatment and ultimately forms The Dallas Buyers Club, smuggling non-FDA approved drugs from everywhere he could and distributing them to other AIDS sufferers all over the world. Woodroof himself lived until 1992.<br/><br/>Part of Woodroof's realization that we're all human and helping AIDS patients came from his strong friendship with Rayon (Jared Leto), a transgender also diagnosed with AIDS. He is also befriended by a compassionate doctor (Jennifer Garner) who doesn't believe that AZT is the answer for AIDS and is interested in other drug protocols.<br/><br/>I actually have never believed, and don't believe now, that pharmaceutical companies are interested in a cure for AIDS -- maybe an AIDS vaccine -- but there is too much money in stopping the progression. Also, let's face it, AIDS has become big business, with the growth of organizations to serve the HIV/AIDS communities as well as foundations dedicated to research.<br/><br/>Consequently, nothing about this film and the behavior of the FDA surprised me, and I have to agree with what was said by a judge in the film - terminally ill people should be able to try anything they want if they believe it might help them.<br/><br/>My big problem with the movie is that I believe Woodroff was bisexual, and I don't understand why he isn't in the film. It seems to me to be a cowardly move.<br/><br/>The performances are exceptional -- but then, both McConaughey and Leto have been given exceptional roles that are also sympathetic. Sometimes it's hard to separate all of that from performance. When A Time to Kill was released, I transcribed an interview with Matthew McConaughey. Back then, he had a dog named Miss Hud and asked his agent if he could meet Paul Newman. Suddenly he started making fluff and taking his shirt off. But the talent exhibited in this movie was always there, as was the commitment -- along the way he got lost in the money, I guess. This had to be a role close to his heart -- he is from Texas and has probably met men like Woodroof. He does a beautiful job.<br/><br/>As Rayon, Jared Leto is magnificent, totally believable, giving a poignant, warm performance. He's long been a versatile human being, and this is a wonderful achievement.<br/><br/>If you didn't live through this period, this film will perhaps not have the effect on you that it will have on others. The death sentence, the distancing of friends, the refusal of some hospital workers to touch you (as happened to a friend of mine) -- men too young to die, at a time when nothing could be done for them. If people became angry with the FDA, it was for good reason, though they did rush things along. Part of it was the political pressure exerted by gays and good for them.<br/><br/>Today, thanks to people like Ron Woodroof, it's possible to live with this disease. For the thousands and thousands who died, they just contracted the disease a little too early.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws, this is a thought-provoking film about a miserable time."

","Dallas 1985. Ron Woodroof is a heavy smoking, drinking, coke head, casual sex having kind of guy. He is a stereotypical cowboy redneck: racist and homophobic. Not at all the man you'd want to cheer for, while in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. That said, watching Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of an HIV+ man who won't let himself quit, was a different ad amazing experience for me. Survival is his only choice. His remarkable portrayal with natural cadence of speech and emaciated condition really sales the man you want to like. It's a good look back at what it was like to deal A.I.D.S. in the eighties. Jared Leto's performance in this movie signals that a five year absence was well worth the wait. It almost makes you want to cryif I could, Iwould have. Leto sold his character. He was the heart behind McConaughey success in the film. Not my at all the type of film I would watch, but it was an experience worth the trip for me."

","So, who would of know Matthew McConaughey can perform as a highly descent actor!? After the likes of endless rom-coms such as 'Failure to launch'(2006) and 'How to lose a guy in 10 days'(2003) this new found serious-acting Matthew is a breath of fresh air. He has recently dived into a pit of dramatically induced pieces that favour his style of witty to versatile well.<br/><br/>In Dallas buyers club we behold the surreal true story of Ron Woodroof, a sweaty grease ball of a Texan. From the start we witness his life innovate. He starts off as a cheap cocaine (and even cheaper hooker) doing, gay-hating piece of trailer trash.<br/><br/>After a chance work accident he finds himself in hospital, 29 days to live and HIV positive, a diagnosis he is unable to process. The apparentness of the illness is surreal, a previous well-built McCaughey appears gut wrenched and frail in a Christian Bale-in-The-Machinist severity. The previous up to snuff Matthew seems non-existent; replaced by this gaunt aged emaciated individual.<br/><br/>The illness that is consuming his life seems fight-able to Ron, making it compelling for the audience to witness. As he tries to carry on his usual crummy day-to-day he finds himself held back. Abandoned by his friends- who stereotypically perceive him as having 'faggot blood' and with no job, Ron refuses anguish and travels to Mexico to acquire unapproved drugs that stall the disease.<br/><br/>Enlightened by a still obnoxious Woodroof he exploits the opportunity for a quick buck. With the unlikely be-friending of fellow AIDS patient and transvestite Rayon (Jared Leto) Dallas Buyers Club is created, a legal dodging membership (which includes the drugs as a bonus) for a monthly compensation.<br/><br/>At first Rayon and Ron clash, their two different identities repel them from each other, Ron's wild homophobia targets directly towards Rayon, yet still Woodroof is slowly over won by Rayon's sweetness and charm. Together Leto and McConaughey work together in harmony on the screen, lifting this gritty drama to surviving saga of day to day triumphs around the USA government. The duo's work is easily the most dramatically capable pieces they have ever ventured into.<br/><br/>Both parts are truly sublime but McConaughey excels above all. His schemes never falter but still you a left warmed up to Ron even though his 'charitable' efforts towards fellow AIDS sufferers are more like a personal business. Perhaps you are effected by Ron's life due to his effort to romance his former doctor Dr. Eve Saks (Screen Actors Guild Award winner Jennifer Garner) or just his defying illness and ability to preserve and stick at life.<br/><br/>Overall this film is an impressive contribution to the film year. Although not easy to watch as the downer of the subject is hard to consume the screenplay and realism brought by the acting and plot uplifts the audience. The inspiring true (and important) story is easily one of the year's best films. Dallas buyers club is just one of the recent illustrations of McConaughey's contribution to notable acting, which I am sure with develop over the next few years to become the peak of his acting career.<br/><br/>Impressive must see: 9/10"

","Ron Woodroof, hard drinker, recreational drug user, partaker of casual sex, and all round hard-livin' man's man, is diagnosed with HIV and given 30 days to live. After initially railing against the situation, he knuckles down to research, discovers that the US medical establishment is so restrictive that helpful medications are not available. Time is pressing, so he sources supplies from Mexico and, from there, it is a small step to sourcing supplies for others. The medical establishment is not happy...<br/><br/>Based on a true story (though with one or two significant fictitious amendments), this film is always fascinating. It has two sides and, although you are always in Ron's camp (notwithstanding that he does not appear to be a nice person in any accepted sense), there is justification in the argument that, without proper scientific trials, you don't know whether a particular treatment is truly effective. This, of course, is no consolation if it is being withheld despite the fact that it is the only possibility of staving off certain imminent death).<br/><br/>Jared Leto as flamboyantly transsexual Rayon is terrific, and the developing relationship between him and the homophobic Ron is enormously moving, and forms the heart of the film. But the film overall belongs to Matthew McConnaughey. His commitment shows in the physical transformation he took upon himself - looking gaunt throughout, his wasted skeletal presence in the final courtroom scenes is heartbreaking - but his performance throughout is a big part of making this film as powerful as it is."

","Sex addict, junky, drunk, redneck, racist, homophobe, trash, scum, asshole, prick, one of the many adjectives that define our protagonist in Dallas Buyers Club. In fact through out the film our protagonist never changes except for one thing - will to live. Amazingly, we love this guy throughout the film. This film appears to be the Gran Torino of this year.<br/><br/>If someone went up to me five years ago and were to tell me that Matthew McConaughey will be one of the finest actors in 2014 I would of not only laughed but would have gotten angry. But it's true. Our shirtless texan would win actor of the year at the Roscars (Ryan + Oscars). He's in two Oscar nominated films (Dallas Buyers Club and The Wolf on Wall street) and in a very underlooked film called ""Mud"" which he also excels most performances this year.<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Marc Vallée who really hasn't put out anything worth caring about is a true story (kind of a rag to riches of human nature) of Ron Woodroof. A gambler of bull riding (rides a pretty good streak because if he loses he usually just runs) that lives day to day and tomorrow isn't a certainty until he receives news that he is HIV positive.<br/><br/>Given only 30 days to live he ignores every doctors orders and finds his own cure by visiting Mexico and finding a non FDA approved substance that prolongs his life. He smuggles this back into the United States dressed as a reverend and swears it's for his own use. He sells it on the black market saving many other AIDS patience teaming up with Rayon (Jared Leto) a cross dressing faggot - words of Ron.<br/><br/>Ron learns not only learns how life is precious but also accepts (I use this term loosely) homosexuals, cross dressers etc. Calling it Dallas Buyers Club allowing people to join with 400 dollars for a month of meds. Making lots of money and extending others' lives until the FDA shuts him down.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a comedy by most means but it is an excellent character study and you'll get plenty of private moments with Ron. Jennifer Garner plays Eve, a doctor that attempts to befriend Ron while keeping her job at the same time which doesn't approve of Ron's new business. Probably her best performance since ""Juno"".<br/><br/>The movie definitely mocks the FDA (Food drug administration) which is the villain in the movie. One of the best lines in the movie when Ron is called a ""common drug dealer"" he responds ""Oh, I'm the drug dealer? No, you're the F*****' drug dealer. I mean, goddamn, people are dyin'. And y'all are up there afraid that we're gonna find an alternative without you."" The FDA is nothing but a business. Ron shops in a grocery store and tears up every bit of food which has the ""FDA approved"" slogan but still reeks of pesticides and unnatural hormones. Excellent screenplay in this one.<br/><br/>I think I might start giving most actors that I had the displeasure of watching before another shot. It took Matthew McConaughey till he he was 45 to take better scripts (roles that require the shirt on most the story). I have to admit this is my favorite acting performance this year. Even over the great ""12 years a Slave""."

","In 1985 Dallas, electrician and hustler Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) works around the system to help AIDS patients get the medication they need after he is himself diagnosed with the disease.<br/><br/>While ""12 Years a Slave"" is likely the winner of Academy Award for Best Picture, this review will make the case for ""Dallas Buyers Club"". Personally, this is the stronger film and the more important film.<br/><br/>We all know that Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto gave the best performances of their respective careers here. The extreme weight loss (and health damage it caused) is enough to deserve an award, but then to go on and give powerful performances is just amazing. Leto is more than convincing as Rayon, a pre-op transsexual woman. If he does not win, something is wrong with the world.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey has only risen over the years, going from cult movies (""Dazed and Confused"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next generation"") to romantic comedies (""Failure to Launch"" among others). He has now gone on to repeated success with ""Killer Joe"", ""Mud"" and this film (not to mention his brief part in ""Wolf of Wall Street""). His acting may continue to be honed, but will he ever surpass this role? I think not, and for that reason he needs the award.<br/><br/>Back to the film as a whole. While ""12 Years a Slave"" deals with the historically emotional subject of slavery, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" brings us a far more hard-hitting story. The 1980s are not so long ago that we cannot remember them, but are just far enough ago that relatively few to practically none of the people suffering from AIDS at the time are still with us today. Only a few decades later, HIV infection does not have to be the end of the world, and this film shows the turning point in that battle.<br/><br/>Further, there is the interesting distinction that Woodroof made between ""not approved"" and ""illegal"". This makes for a brilliant plot point -- what he was doing was not importing illegal drugs, but merely ones that were not granted a seal of approval from the government yet. Whether that makes such medication illegal or not is fascinating -- and then the loophole of selling memberships rather than selling drugs... brilliant again! The film is both emotional and highly intelligent.<br/><br/>Parallels have probably been drawn -- with or without success -- to today's issues of marijuana legalization, FDA approval of current drugs, or the health care system as a whole. But this is not necessary for the film to be meaningful and enjoyable.<br/><br/>The only issue I had was Woodroof's transformation from a bigot to someone who at least tolerates homosexuality, if not fully accepts it. He seems to transition much quickly than one might expect. Allegedly, the real life Woodroof was not anti-gay and may even have been bisexual. That would have worked well, or at least toning the bigotry down in the early scenes. Getting from A to B in two hours is plausible, but A to C or D? Not gonna happen."
"classicsoncall","8","1","1","23 February 2014"," ""If it sucks, I got it.""
","As I'm watching some of the early scenes where Rayon (Jared Leto) and Eve (Jennifer Garner) are on screen together, I'm thinking to myself, how is it possible that Leto is prettier than Garner? I just couldn't wrap my head around that idea. Just like you might not be able to wrap your own head around the idea that Leto and Matt McConaughey both lost some big time poundage to get into their roles here. If I didn't know McConaughey was the Ron Woodroof character before the picture started, I wouldn't have had a clue who the guy was. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>So I have to plead ignorance to the history depicted in the film. I know film makers take huge liberty when making a picture, so I don't know how much of this is true or poetic license. Certainly Woodroof's wheeling and dealing all over the world stretches credibility given his white trash, trailer park origins, so I'll simply have to take that as a given. Actually, I was dumbfounded as soon as he started using a computer.<br/><br/>With all the politics and money involved in bringing new medical advances to reality, the story itself is believable enough. We've seen it before where bad decisions are made just because the monetary stakes were so huge, and from that standpoint the picture is both noteworthy and frustrating at the same time. But beyond that, it's the performances you have to see here even if the entire story were fictional. You'll be transfixed by the characters of Woodroof and Rayon as they navigate their way through the picture while virtually morphing their appearance from one scene to the next."

","Matthew McConaughey is amazing as Ron Woodruff, a foul-mouthed Texan electrician and rodeo rider who is addicted to drugs and sex. When injured on a job, he is taken to the hospital in 1985 where he learns from two doctors (Denis O'Hare and Jennifer Garner) that he has contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. They estimate that he has 30 days to live and tell him to get his affairs in order. Woodroof cannot believe he could have that disease. He storms out of the hospital convinced that they screwed up his blood tests.<br/><br/>Ron buys AZT from a hospital orderly, and when that dries up he heads to Mexico. He is advised that AZT is toxic and is put on a regimen of supplements. He finds that this alternative treatment helps him, and he returns to Texas with a car load of the supplements. He partners with Rayon (Jared Leto), a drug-addicted transsexual he met in the hospital, and soon they are recruiting AIDS patients in support groups. To avoid being accused of selling non-FDA approved treatments, they set up the ""Dallas Buyer's Club."" Members pay $400 for all of the treatments they need. Before long, Ron is traveling the world for experimental drugs to add to his offerings.<br/><br/>The government comes down on him like a ton of bricks - the FDA, the IRS, Big Pharma - everybody wants to shut him down.<br/><br/>This movie is based upon a true story, and it is fascinating. McConaughey and Leto give Oscar-worthy performances."
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","1","21 February 2014"," McConaughey nails it.
","4 years ago Matthew McConaughey's embarrassing run of romcoms (Fool's Gold, Failure to Launch, The Wedding Planner) hit its nadir with the abysmal Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, and all looked bleak for the once promising star. Then after a two year sabbatical, the Texan struck back with critically acclaimed turns in Lincoln Lawyer, Killer Joe, Mud, Magic Mike and The Wolf of Wall Street, all within 24 months. The career transformation is elevated even further here with his Oscar nommed and Golden Globe winning performance as redneck cowboy turned AIDS patient Ron Woodroof. Refusing to give in to the sickness and enraged with the limited medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AIDS, Woodroof starts up the titular club in order to supply non-approved (but not illegal) drugs to those suffering from the disease, causing major ripples within the system in the process. Despite being a true story (from 1985), Dallas Buyers Club comes after a long line of similar stories told on film and subsequently can't shake its clichéd and predictable trimmings: egotistical pig finding his humility, unlikely friendship between polar opposites, big bad corporation stomping on the little people, etc. Yet the shortfalls in the screenplay are more than compensated by the amazing on screen commitment and charisma of the leading trio. As transvestite homosexual Rayon, Jared Leto is sympathetic, engaging and thankfully grounded despite his surface-level flamboyance, whilst Jennifer Garner is in career best form as Eve, a by-the-book but empathetic doctor who genuinely just wants the best for her patients. However this is undeniably the McConaughey show and boy does he nail it."

","I love slice of life movies and particularly ones that tell a real tale. I lost friends in the 80's in Sydney from AIDS. This movie brought it all back. My friends started disappearing, then there was AZt the saviour - well not quite. They disappeared but slower. I hung out with a bunch of gay guys, me and my straight partner. It was an accident of association. A bunch of mostly kiwis then one climbed out of the closet and we all became friends with a new group of people, gay people. I frequented gay nightclubs, The Laurels a take off on the academy awards for gays behaving badly, social events, weekends away, fabulous. I met Larry who the lead in Priscilla Queen of the Desert is based on. I also met people just like the queues at the clinic young, old, promiscuous and devoted loving couples.<br/><br/>Anyway I wander. This film, which I saw with my 23 year old straight son was absolutely reliving it, right there, experience. I have read the book and I think the enactment was fantastic. Intelligent, unenlightened and working on it - amazing.<br/><br/>The portrait of the fight with FDA was so good, haunting and a reflection on USA big brother knows best. Incredible to think that all this happened before the internet. He has to search through physical books and articles.<br/><br/>I was also impressed that this didn't wallow into a pity party. It was at a time before AIDS was really understood so it could have easily.<br/><br/>A great movie - I hope it gets a chance at an Oscar but then lots of movies I love never get anywhere near it and things I think are pointless and stupid do - who knows.

"saschakrieger","8","1","1","20 February 2014"," Riding the bull
","The contrast could hardly be any greater: In the opening of Dallas Buyers Club, the viewer enters the rough macho world of American bull riding, a world inhabited unashamedly by people from the lower social strata of the ""lone-star state"". Next we are in a hospital: friendly, white, anti-septic, efficient. Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey) belongs to the former universe: a bull riding (although we only get to see him at that at the very end), womanizing, gambling homophobic redneck of the worst kind. Thrown into the latter environment and confronted with an HIV diagnosis, he has to try and cope with a world he doesn't know – that of the peak of the AIDS scare in 1985 – one in which he finds himself weak, facing his own death, in which he's ostracized by his former buddies and shares his fate with those he despises, such as the transsexual Rayon (Jared Leto in a rare return to what the 30 Seconds to Mars front man still does best: acting). After initial denial, Woodruff stubbornly sets out to defy the doctors' prognosis that he only has 30 days left to live. He goes to Mexico, finds alternative drugs and – back in gambling and money-making mode – starts a business selling those drugs which have not been approved by U.S. authorities yet, fighting the systems and reluctantly having to question his own beliefs.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's film. Not only did he lose over 20 kg to play the emaciated Woodruff, he becomes his character in the best possible sense. McConaughey starts out as an entirely unsympathetic and rather despicable homophobic and misogynistic man in dirty jeans and T shirt and he follows his character's development into a conscientious campaigner, savvy businessman and caring friend without entirely turning him inside out. The redneck is still there in the end, the macho, too, the swagger having become perhaps even greater. McConaughey and director Jean-Marc Vallée avoid any Saul to Paul cliché, they show a man who does what he needs to survive a little longer, whose selfishness results in helping others and ultimately something resembling compassion, whose gigantic ego enables him to fight against the odds and become a completely unlikely hero. Who has nothing heroic about him: McConaughey does not idolize Woodruff, he does not explain him – he is there, plain and simple, in all his ugliness, meanness, and prejudice. He is no saint but a fully fleshed-out human: very flawed but with an almost obscene will to live. The subtlety with which McConaughey depicts his character, the uncompromising way with which he inhabits him, carry the film and make it a convincing plea for humaneness and compassion with the conviction that it can be found anywhere and in any place. Dallas Buyers Club reminds the viewer that it is not the ""good people"" alone who affect change, that progress can start with anyone.<br/><br/>Vallée's best move was to give the film entirely to McConaughey, aided by a cast headed by Leto whose portrayal of Rayon between self-assured pride and broken despair should earn him more than the Oscar nomination he already has (as does McConaughey). Vallée focuses on Woodruff, gives him a carefully designed environment of mid-1980s shabbiness, dynamic photography that reflects the unsteadiness of this driven man, and pale washed-out colors placing him clearly in a world and time when fear brought out the worst in otherwise seemingly civilized people. The discriminatory atmosphere of U.S. society at the time is hinted at, as is the questionable role the authorities played when it came to dealing with the AIDS epidemic. If you took McConaughey out of the film, Dallas Buyers Club would at best be a very conventional and highly average drama – with him, however, this is an outstanding and memorable film about how hard and how easy it is to be human. At the end of the film, Ron finally rides a bull. In a way, he hasn't done anything else.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"

Based largely on real events and characters, Dallas Buyers Club rises painful but important issues regarding discretion/sovereignty, health care, medical tests, marketing of pharmaceuticals - among others. I personally can understand respective arguments given by the authorities, except for the mortally ill; I find that those people should use each and every opportunity for getting better as worsening of health is no subject here anymore.<br/><br/>All the above is dealt in a gripping manner, and even if you guess the outcomes, it is still interesting to follow the events and ponder on and over different attitudes, ways of life and activities. And the two most colorful types: Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof and Jared Leto as Rayon/Raymond - with both big physical and spiritual sacrifices in preparing for the roles, the outcome is superb, and I really hope they will get their Academy Awards they fully deserve. They outperform all the others, and following them on screen enables to feel both passion and compassion in this gloomy and rather hopeless surroundings.<br/><br/>All in all, Dallas Buyers Club is a good movie, but the topics and approaches make it difficult to watch it repeatedly or recommend it to everyone (including those with contacts with fatal diseases) - similar to e.g. Philadelphia or Leaving Las Vegas."

McConaughey's role here is the reason to see the film and he is very well supported by 30 Second to Mars front man Jared Leto as cross dressing hard knock case Rayon a role in which to could be delivering a gold statue to the actor.<br/><br/>With such show stopping lead performances the other areas of Dallas Buyers Club do feel like a lesser success with the storyline and journey of a man who defied the government, doctors and his own beliefs not really packing the punch it could of with such a multi-layered arc. Jumps in time through the film feel unnatural and the direction of artistic specialist Valle not being in anyway a standout which is a surprise considering some of the locales that the film pays a visit to. Another downfall of the film is in the supporting cast who with McConaughey and Leto leading a charge fall far behind the pack with this evident in particular with Jennifer Garner in a underwritten and slight role as the good doctor.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a must see movie thanks to the once in a blue moon transformation of an actor with what is evidenced by McConaughey. The movie features him in almost every scene and when the film is held up against the man who truly is Ron Woodroof the film pales in comparison, getting 6 Oscar nominations is therefore a little much for a film made around acting.

","Set in the mid-1980s, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB focuses on the life of Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), who imports the medicine that fellow AIDS victims need, while circumventing the official system in the process. What sets Jean-Marc Vallée's film apart is its refusal to sentimentalize the material: in McConaughey's performance he comes across as both homophobic and insecure. Even though he forms a close relationship with cross-dresser Rayon (Jared Leto), it's clear that he views homosexuality as somehow deviant. On the other hand, once he has been diagnosed with AIDS, Woodroof is ostracized by his fellow-Texan drinking buddies, who accuse him of being gay. We may admire Woodroof's ingenuity, as he exploits the system to procure supplies of drugs for his buyer's club, but we remain unsure as to his motives; is he performing a service or simply proving to himself that he can defy the doctors' prognosis that he has only 30 days to life? Or both. The film is deliberately shot in washed-out colors; this is a dark, subterranean world of seedy bars and ascetic hospital wards, where AIDS sufferers try to cope with the trauma of living with the disease, while being exploited by doctors such as Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare), who are more interested in profit motives than patient welfare. McConaughey and Leto are simply outstanding. Both of them had to lose considerable amounts of weight for their roles; their performances - especially as AIDS wreaks its ravages on them - are both understated yet intensely affecting. Definitely worth an Oscar or two, hopefully."

","""DALLAS BUYERS CLUB"" is an exception movie with Oscar winning grade performances from Matthew McConaughey. It is ultimately a triumphant look at the tenacious will to live when death is waiting for you by your side. Matthew McConaughey played Ron Woodroof, a real person and a character flawed with a devil-may-care lifestyle that was carelessly lived on the fast lane. Through him, the movie takes you into the 80's and show a first person view of the milieu of HIV, its impacts on a personal and human scale and all the bigotries and greed that are either reaffirmed or evoked as a result. The battle that Woodroof won was not just against the grip of the disease, but also against a system of inappropriate control of the drug by a FDA that was driven by the drug company. In the end, the movie is a kind of tribute to those who lived and died because of the virus and it is shown through the humanity, the experience, the will and the redemption of this character, Mr. Woodroof."

","Ron Woodruff(Matthew McConaughey)is portrayed as an electrician and part time macho bull rider in Dallas, Texas in the mid-eighties. He was shown to have strong homophobic views and was devastated to learn that we had HIV through unprotected sex with a drug user. His doctor, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) gives him 30 days to get his affairs in order. Ron is, firstly, dismissive of her diagnosis but then remembers his prior contact. He gives the finger to his doctors & friends, who shun him. The movie charts his education with regard to the limited options in the USA and his travels worldwide to buy the unapproved (by the FDA)drugs to prolong his life. He realises, before his doctors, that the drug AZT had a negative effect. He meets Rayon (Jared Leto)who is an AIDS infected, trans-gender drug addict. He firstly see Rayon as everything he finds abhorrent about homosexuals but then realises that he needs Rayon to sell his drugs to the gay community. Woodruff creates the Dallas Buyers Club to sell his illegal drugs, $400 membership fee & free drugs. I guess that this is a modern day ""Streets of Philadelphia"", reminding us of the panic & ignorance in the eighties when AIDS was mentioned. The grudging friendship between Woodruff & Rayon was very poignant. The performance by the two male leads is spectacular. Their physical appearance is breathtaking, especially McConaughey during the court scene at the end of the picture. The scene that will stay with me was with McConaughey & Garner when he tells her ""I feel I'm fighting for a life I ain't got the time to live"".

","Matthew McConaughey's career was leading up to the masterwork that is Dallas Buyers Club (2013). The man has always struck me as an actor who played roles beneath his ability of the sake of a paycheck. At the apex of his popularity the Southern-fried hunk seemed to be languishing in the romantic comedy doldrums; How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Failure to Launch (2006), Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2008), et al.<br/><br/>Then came the 2010's, and McConaughey surprised the masses. It all started with the supremely underrated The Lincoln Lawyer (2011) which didn't get that much attention from audiences yet McConaughey's performance garnered near universal praise. That film in addition to memorable supporting parts in The Paperboy (2012) Magic Mike (2012) and Bernie (2011) led to his breakout year 2013, which includes a supporting role in Wolf of Wall Street (2013) and a lead role in film festival circuit darling Mud (2012). Now he's poised to win the Best Actor Oscar for his work in Dallas Buyers and make no mistake he will deservedly win.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club starts with Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) having a steamy three-way in the darkened hallways under the Dallas rodeo. He fancies himself a bit of a hustler and a delinquent though when not at the rodeo or consuming booze and cocaine, he's an electrician. After an accident at work he wakes up dazed and is told they did blood-work on him and discovered he's HIV-positive. The doctors (Jennifer Garner and Michael O'Neill) estimate he's got thirty days to live.<br/><br/>The hard drinking, hard living Woodroof goes through quite a dramatic change over the course of the movie. An admitted homophobe, Woodroof is ostracized by his peers because according to them he's got f****t blood. He finds a community of people going through the same thing and at first tries to exploit them for profit. That's when he meets Rayon (Jared Leto), a transvestite who sees the opportunistic hick for what he is but nevertheless helps him with his burgeoning business. And what is this business you ask? Well you'll have to watch the film.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, McConaughey will likely win the Best Actor Oscar for the following reasons: The actor lost all most fifty pounds to prepare for a role that at the beginning is heard to like the impossible not to love. He plays a character that addresses a still, very prevalent health issue in this country and does so with bravado. Finally, his Woodroof goes up against some heavy players' i.e. big pharmaceutical.<br/><br/>The other strong performance and likely Oscar recipient in Dallas Buyers Club is the revelatory Jared Leto who has been absent from films for four years to focus on his music career as the front man for 30 Seconds to Mars. He likewise lost a considerable amount of weight for the role of a lifetime. Like William Hurt's performance in Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985), Leto doesn't ham it up and mold the character into an offensive stereotype of homosexuality. Instead he creates a sympathetic character who is far from a mensch yet partially redeemed through his actions. In other words a true, live, fully fleshed out character.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a superb film about a sinner turned saint who fumbles into greatness through an unbearable tragedy. He goes up against impossible odds with a positive attitude and a sinister grin towing the line between a community leader and advocate and an opportunistic drug smuggler. If you're a believer in grace and redemption and a fan of outstanding acting, you need to watch Dallas Buyers Club. I promise you by the time the credits role, you'll love McConaughey's style. He's gone a long way since The Wedding Planner (2001) I tell you what.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

","One of the most memorable things is the weight loss to the two lead actors both Matthew and Jared. Jared Leto is unrecognizable as the mincing cross dresser. Matthew is painfully thin especially considering what he used to look like. Apart from the weight loss Matthew does give a convincing and believable performance. So does Jared. Their performances are deserving of the awards won so far. Jennifer Garner is less perky than usual and is good too. The story doesn't drag and has some humor and light heartedness which keeps it from getting too depressing. Maybe it didn't have to emphasize the drugs and promiscuity quite that much - just enough to show how he was infected.<br/><br/>What is unexpected is how interesting the story about the treatment drugs and the FDA. Not since And the Band Played On has there been such a good movie about the disease from a medical scientific point. The government interference in the best treatment and having to go abroad for better options is a good lesson for any disease."

","""Welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club!""<br/><br/>One of the main themes in cinema during 2013 had to do with reinventing oneself, or at least I found it a common thread in several movies (American Hustle and The Wolf of Wall Street being the main examples). As good as those movies were, nothing defines the term better than Matthew McConaughey who completely reinvented himself over the last couple of years and has become one of the best Hollywood actors. 2011 was a turning point for him with a great performance in The Lincoln Lawyer and then he followed his success in Bernie, Killer Joe, The Paper Boy, and Magic Mike. This year he blew me away in my favorite film of the year, MUD; he also delivered a short but memorable performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, and now he was mesmerizing in Dallas Buyers Club. He has been racking up awards this year for this great performance and is the frontrunner to win the Oscar as well. I would pretty much see him in anything he's doing right now and I actually began watching his new HBO series, True Detective, which looks promising. The reason why I dedicated so much lines talking about him more than I did about the movie is because he is what makes this film so entertaining. Dallas Buyers Club would just be an average film without him, but his performance is so powerful that it becomes the main reason why you should see it. It's not just about the physical transformation he went through, he also delivers a raw and energetic performance that makes Dallas Buyers Club such a transcendent film. <br/><br/>Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a Texas homophobic redneck working as an electrician while making some money on the side as a rodeo cowboy. He's a heavy smoker, drinker, and frequent drug user who likes to engage in casual sex. His life takes a drastic change after the doctors discover that he's HIV positive and will most likely die within 30 days. Not accepting his death sentence, he begins to do some research and discovers that there are unapproved drugs that could help him extend his life. He crosses the border into Mexico and finds that the alternative treatments are effective so he decides to smuggle them into the U.S. Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare), the doctor who diagnosed him, is against this treatment as he is testing his patients with a trial drug called AZT which the pharmaceutical companies are pushing to get through. He does find some sympathy in Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), but there isn't much she can do to help him. However in the hospital he finds an unlikely ally in the transvestite Rayon (Jared Leto) who doesn't care for government regulations either and together they establish a buyers club where members can have access to these unapproved drugs for a monthly fee. This is where Ron's battle begins as he not only has to fight his disease, but the government as well while trying to smuggle more effective drugs to the country.<br/><br/>If you need another reason beside McConaughey to go see Dallas Buyers Club than Jared Leto might just be it. He too has been piling up awards this season for his supporting role as the transvestite Rayon. He also delivers a memorable performance that makes this film even more entertaining. These two characters are the driving force of the film. The film is powerful and engaging thanks to them because it really doesn't say anything new about the AIDS plague during the 80's or the ridiculous government and pharmaceutical regulations. The story does deal with these issues, but if you want to really become enraged about them there are many other films that do it much better, like the documentary How To Survive a Plague. What this film has going for it are the performances from Matthew and Jared, and those two should be the only awards it receives come Oscar time. Gravity may have blown you away thanks to its spectacular visuals and technical achievements, but Dallas Buyers Club will blow you away thanks to these two characters. The many flaws the film may have concerning pacing and script don't take away from the mesmerizing experience of seeing these two actors reinventing themselves the way they have in this film. They are responsible for transforming this average biopic into a compelling and engaging one. Keep living!"

","Dallas Buyers Club was a great surprise for me. Matthew McCounaghey puts here his bes career performance by far, and in my opinion the best performance that I've seen in the entire year. He lost 44 pounds and incorporated the Texan with the HIV disease perfectly. He really disappears in the role. But above that all, the story has a lot of layers, but it always goes ahead, never get boring or something, because somehow these layers(the conflicts in his personal life, and how his life changed after he discovered he had HIV, and how the Dallas Buyers Club is build). The development of the protagonist is excellent, every detail in the story is important, has a goal into the film. As a result, the story always goes ahead, it never stops in pointless scenes. I also find quite easy to get through the film. The story is full of conflicts, and as I said, it never stops in being interesting. It's after all, about real life happenings. I find interesting when the Bio- film is made entirely based in a period of the life of one person, and not about trying to resume a person's life in 120 minutes. Being said, everything depends on how well the story is told. And Dallas Buyers Club is, guaranteed, a great story. The most entertaining film of the year. 8.8/10"
"mark-durfor","6","3","6","13 February 2014"," Dallas Buyers Club is a so-so movie with brilliant performances
","marksmoviemind.blogspot.com<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is based on the true story of an electrician / rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) and his unlikely campaign to spread awareness and provide comfort and medicine for those who contracted AIDS. The story is set in Dallas in 1985 where Woodroof works hard and plays even harder, drinking, smoking, abusing illegal drugs and having casual sex. After seeing a doctor after a work-related injury, Woodroof is informed he has the AIDS virus and is given a month to live. At first, his ignorance and bravado prompt a defiant denial. Once he comes to terms and accepts the facts, he refuses to accept that there's nothing he can do. He does whatever he can to find treatments to at least prolong his life. In the process, he befriends and helps others who are afflicted with AIDS, others he would normally have nothing to do with. He dances dangerously between two worlds: the public world in which he provides assistance and medicine, and the private world trying to stay hidden from the FDA and authorities. <br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Matthew McConaughey) and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Jared Leto). Leto has been nominated and won dozens of awards for his role as Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club. Rayon is a cross-dressing prostitute who starts as Woodroof's business partner and ends up his friend as Woodroof's greedy nature evolves into compassion. When hospitals refuse to give Woodroof any treatment for his AIDS because the medicine has not been approved by the FDA, his investigation leads him to Mexico. There, Woodroof concocts a scheme to make a lot of money by smuggling the experimental medication into the United States and distributing the drugs to those who need it. In an effort to evade the FDA, Woodroof starts the Dallas Buyers Club and sells memberships, not drugs. The drugs just come with the membership. At first, this is just a way for Woodroof to prolong his own life and make some money in the process. Somewhere along the way, he finds himself compelled to actually fight for the right of those with the AIDS virus to obtain treatment and to be treated not only for their illness, but also as human beings.<br/><br/>The movie is exactly what the preview proclaims it to be: the story of Ron Woodroof dealing with contracting the AIDS virus, fighting with hospitals that are handcuffed by the FDA as far as what treatments they are allowed to administer, fighting with the FDA which is less concerned about actual treatment and more concerned about profit, and fighting with stereotypes about those who have contracted the virus. It's a sad story, it's upsetting, and it was brilliantly acted by McConaughey and Leto who definitely deserve the Oscar nominations they have received. But I don't feel the movie itself is worthy of the nomination for best picture of the year. I felt is was slow and boring at times in spite of the outstanding acting performances. I gave it 3.0 stars as I don't feel it was a waste of money, but I'm not excited to see it again and this won't be making it to my personal collection. I'd say it's a good renter or matinée in the theatres."
"CEBaum","8","3","6","6 November 2013"," A gritty, efficient film
","This isn't the sort of film that wows with writing or directing (especially the former). Instead, it's a simple, issue-driven drama that serves as a vehicle for some first-rate performances. Dallas Buyers Club isn't likely to stand the test of time, but it does provide an effective platform for Matthew McConaughey's continuing career renaissance, as well as a return to the silver screen for actor/singer Jared Leto.<br/><br/>Any number of films have covered some aspect of the AIDS crisis, including last year's documentary How to Survive a Plague. This true-life story, however, tackles the topic with a protagonist who's anything but what one would expect. Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is a free-wheeling, hard-living Texas good ole boy, as heterosexual as they come. In the opening scenes, he drinks, fights, participates in the rodeo, and throws a few homophobic slurs at Rock Hudson. Suffice it to say that he's far from an ally to the LGBTQ movement.<br/><br/>That doesn't exactly change when, after collapsing in his trailer park home, he's diagnosed with HIV. Initially offended by the mere idea that he could even have the virus, Ron eventually comes to grips with his situation. The fire in his eyes, initially a lust for life, suddenly becomes a burning desire to survive. Of course, obstacles abound, namely the medical establishment. Even kind-hearted doctor Eve (Jennifer Garner) is initially determined to make Ron stick to a trial medicine that seems to do more harm than good. Ron, not content with the timeline of his so called treatment, decides to take things into his own hands with a trip into Mexico.<br/><br/>At its core, Dallas Buyers Club is a classic story of a rebel railing against part of the establishment. With conversations about healthcare taking up so much space in current public discourse, the film couldn't feel more contemporary, even though it begins in the early 80s. Having the AIDS crisis as a backdrop proves to be fertile ground for director Jean-Marc Vallee and writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack. Neither the writing nor directing handle the setting with histrionics or melodrama.<br/><br/>This is a gritty, efficient film, and a complete 180 from Vallee's last film, the stuffy and unremarkable The Young Victoria. Proving himself an adept chameleon of a director, Vallee lends a (sometimes overeager) energy to the proceedings that gives the story a sense of urgency. With its hand-held photography and reportedly brief shoot, Dallas Buyers Club certainly feels kinetic and alive, even as it tackles a story with painful, life or death consequences. Every now and then Vallee's energy threatens to overwhelm the film – as in a montage of Woodroof traveling abroad – but by and large he gets the job done with just enough flair, all while leaving room for his actors.<br/><br/>Whatever Dallas Buyers Club may be lacking in its overall execution, it makes up for with McConaughey and Leto's committed performances. McConaughey lost a frightening amount of weight for the role, but his appearance is dealt with so matter-of-factly that it's never used as lazy characterization. So many films involving body transformations fail to provide actors with anything to really do beneath their transformations.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club, at the very least, gets the transformative aspect out of the way without any pretense. McConaughey is allowed to be active, physically and emotionally, and the film is better off for it. While I'm still partial to his terrifying turn in last year's Killer Joe, his work here is another excellent addition to his current critical resurgence. Leto, as the cross-dressing Rayon, is also effective in his sheer commitment to his character's mannerisms. Just when the film seems ready to leave Leto with nothing to do on an emotional level, the script throws out some material to give the actor a chance to show why we should be glad that he's acting again. There are tears and pained expressions in Dallas Buyers Club, but they're all a far cry from cheap, manipulative melodrama.<br/><br/>Ultimately, part of what keeps the film from being more than a performance showcase is its reticence to dig deeper into the far-reaching consequences of Woodroof's illegal ring of unapproved HIV medication. Other ""buyers clubs"" are mentioned, but for the most part Borten and Wallack's script is almost entirely focused on Woodroof's world. The man's story, and his gradual adjustment from his worst homophobic tendencies and attitudes, is compelling, but it also feels as though it needs to be grounded in a fuller context.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it's a difficult balance to strike, but in this case the small focus does rob the film of deeper, more lasting impact. As a story of righteous anger and rebellion, Dallas Buyers Club has enough heart and intelligence to make it recommended viewing. But as a look at a major social movement in a turbulent decade, it can't help but feel like a footnote, despite the excellent performances leading the way. Jordan Baker. FMR"

"naq-1","5","23","88","12 October 2013"," Stunt Acting
","This is an example of a movie with over-the-top Stunt Acting, where both Matthew and Jared have taken the idea of weight loss as a character trait and turned it into a justification for an Oscar nod. Although Jared does do an admirable job at keeping himself slim and in character for the role of the Tranny Rayon, Matt just can't help himself and slides right down into his old reliable ""good-ol' Texas boy"" character, and does nothing to change from the dozen other times he has played the same role.<br/><br/>It is also disconcerting to see that the issue of treatments for AIDS becomes secondary in the tale, because this is deemed ""entertainment with a cause."" Whereas the story should be concentrated on the effort to find even a ray of hope in AIDS treatment, we instead get sidetracked into Ron Woodroff's egotistic cry for attention, and baldfaced greed when he starts his ""Buyer's Club"" which is really just a way to get rich quick.<br/><br/>In terms of Ron's homophobic attitudes, there is nothing in the film's execution or in Matthew's acting which leads us to believe that he has acquired a new perspective, and in fact, it plays out that he is just about as annoying at the end as he was at the beginning.<br/><br/>Overall, it would have been more enjoyable if the director was not so concerned about making sure that Ron was portrayed as a womanizer, since the excessive number of scenes that revolve around hetero-sexism tends to overshadow any hope of ever really giving AIDS patients a chance to present themselves as anything more than mere cardboard cutouts-- every other person who occupies Ron's world is background to him and his enormous, over-bearing, bloated ego. And unfortunately, I think that maybe it's not Ron's ego at all, it really is Matthew McConaughey's ego that blocks out any other character who threatens to turn up in his own private Idaho."
"jmdarden-25102","10","2","4","7 October 2019"," Another astounding performance by Matthew McConaughey...
","Like other films McConaughey Matthew shines in, I've seen Buyer's Club several times. Most recently I've binge-watched Season One of True Detective, a must-see for any McConaughey fan. His versatility is unmatched. But, not to get off track, Dallas Buyers Club is just one of those incredible performances where I, as a viewer, completely lost the thought that I was watching an actor perform, so deep and believable it was almost like watching a documentary. Above everything else, it was so moving the watch a racist homophobe transform to a humanitarian whose goal was to help those who were sick have access to the medications they needed to have a chance to live a bit longer, sometimes a matter of just weeks or months or in the case of the real person he portrayed, a matter of years. It was a sobering, heartbreaking reminder of how little the US government agencies did simply because HIV+/AIDS was a""gay man's disease"", brought on by lifestyle choices. Shocking and embarrassing as a country. And it's easy to think how things have grown/evolved, however I shudder to think how it might be handled in todays environment of Twitter rants coming from the White House...not so different coming from a Global Warming/Climate Change denier. Sorry to get off track but just one good and recent example: Trump claims that pollution in San Francisco can be blaimed on the homeless drug addicts tossing their drug infested needles in gutters where they wash out to sea only to cycle back into the city's water supply. A 30 second search taught me that SF's water supply is not based on sea water through a treatment facility...aye aye aye. Has so much really changed in 30+ years?!? Although, thankfully, especially w efforts like Bill Clinton's 100 million effort to help slow the spread and increase the treatment of HIV/AIDS across Africa just one example of success. Again, sorry I'm off track!"

","First of all, I was very impressed by the acting job done by Matt McConoughey. I had previously thought of him as a lightweight melodramatic actor. He has proved me wrong. He can handle the heavy load. His performance was worthy of an Oscar, and it was rightfully given to him. The screenplay was riveting because it showed the AMA and FDA for what they really are; thieves and profiteers. The medical community in the US would rather see thousands of people suffer and die rather than have them get medication from another country that could actually help them. An FDA approved drug has all the validity of a film that is condemned by the Catholic Church because of adult content, like Midnight Cowboy. Obviously, the Church had no clue about quality of film; it was just concerned with the moral issues. The same is true for the FDA and AMA. They are not concerned about effectiveness; only approval of American drug companies. This film is on par with Philadelphia, and in some instances, superior to it. A film not to be missed."

","Matthew McConaughey gives a no-holds-barred, Oscar-winning performance as real-life medical rights pioneer Ron Woodroof, a profane, prejudiced Texas electrician/rodeo aficionado/crooked gambler, who contracted the HIV/AIDS virus in the mid-'80s (through either unprotected sex with an HIV-positive female or through drug use) and was given 30 days to live. Belligerent in his quest to keep himself alive--and finding no relief from the ""wonder drug"" AZT--Woodroof began obtaining powerful drugs from Mexico, Japan and other countries. Unapproved in the U.S. by the FDA, these 'illegal' medications proved to keep Woodroof alive, and also the many HIV-infected people who lined up outside his motel room to purchase them (much to the chagrin of the local medical professionals). McConaughey, painfully gaunt and thin, performs without a shred of vanity; his startling work here shows an actor of great courage and depth. As his drug-addicted transvestite sidekick, Jared Leto (also a deserved Oscar winner) is McConaughey's equal; their slowly developing admiration for each other is convincingly nonchalant, spare and lovely to watch. Jennifer Garner gives her finest performance to date as their doctor, who begins to realize her AZT studies are doing more harm than good, and Denis O'Hare is excellent as Garner's colleague-cum-adversary. A well-realized and incredible drama for adults, hampered now and then by prosy dialogue but almost always kept on-track by the performances, as well as by Jean-Marc Vallée's tight direction. *** from ****"

He's given so little development that there is no emotional impact from his death. He and his plight exist only to drive the development of McConaughey's character, and his death is designed to spur him on. It's a little sickening, especially how this terrible period of history for gay people has been turned into a faux-soulful story of redemption for a straight man.

Knowing that he cannot sell the medication, he decides to call his operation a club with dues and leave it to the members to decide what they wish to and prefer not to take or prescribe to for treatment.<br/><br/>In the end, although not made perfectly clear by this movie, Woodroof's motives change to a more humanitarian nature as he utilizes all of his ill-gotten wealth to help other AIDS victims. <br/><br/>There was an extreme amount of nudity, sexual situations, and drug use.

Matthew McConaughey is fantastic as Ron Woodroof, and is certainly a great choice for the year's best actor choice. However, through there are many great actors involved in the film, Jared Leto absolutely steals the show as Rayon. His performance is not only stellar, but deeply emotional and personal, and his onscreen presence puts your eye on him in every scene- in the best of ways. The film starts off rough, and may be a little hard to dip your feet into, but once you get past it, the film is one battle after another and can easily win your heart with every frame of struggle it has to go through till the end. The direction is brilliant, as well as the writing, and though the cinematography may be only average, it's much appreciated feeling the truly realistic nature the film is going towards. In the end, Dallas Buyers Club is one hell of a hard ride, but a one well earned.

This film goes beyond that to shine light on homosexuality, transgender, AIDS and how the society portrays them as. <br/><br/>Mathew McConaughey and Jared Leto was amazing from beginning to end, with Jared Leto's portrayal of a transgender woman being so flawless, and Mathew's being a Texas cowboy so on point that it definitely deserved the Oscar! <br/><br/>This is what happens with new science, the ever unknowing and if you're to watch this movie, you're set for a good ride of thought on humanity, capitalism, greed, science, medicine and life itself! Definitely recommend it!"

","I really thought Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner were very good at their performances in this film documentary. I have never seen McConaughey look super thin, even though he is normally a thin man in real life. This movie does show how AIDS and HIV were treated so poorly in the 80s and early 90s. I was so sad when Jared Leto's character died of the disease. He reminds me so much of the guy who died of aids from the musical ""Rent"". I nearly was in tears seriously, it was so emotional. <br/><br/>After the ending of the movie, it does make you think and really, we should look after those in need of help while having HIV or aids!"
"filipemanuelneto","7","1","2","26 May 2016"," A razor-sharp movie, but also free and neutral
","In this film, the irreverent and provocative Ron Woodroof, a Texan womanizer, discovers his surprise, that he has AIDS, and decides to seek medication and more effective treatments than those that existed at the time, making them available to those who do not they could afford, and combating the prejudices that exist around the disease, and that he also shared. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, the film has screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, with Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner in the lead roles.<br/><br/>The recipe for success of this film begins with the story: it is a true story based on people who really existed and who fought to humanize the lives of AIDS patients, a disease with no cure but more understood today. However, McConaughey's Woodroof is not a hero, is far from it. It begins to be a hateful and prejudiced character, and only at the end we see how his fight changed the way he thinks. In any case, this is definitely the consecration of work of this actor, who has achieved an outstanding performance, as well as Leto, whose sensitivity and fight against social prejudices made him a symbol of a certain type of AIDS patients. Moreover, both actors were awarded the Oscar for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. A prize, I think, more than deserved. The film has a good photograph, visual and sound effects do their role, as well as the soundtrack, which is not surprising.<br/><br/>There are several notable films about AIDS universe, homosexuality and drugs. In fact, most of the films that address one of these issues end up invariably by address or touch the other two. ""Philadelphia"" is a paradigmatic example. This is a film with feelings but tries not to be cheesy with it, and not focus a lot on advocacy, flags or any kind of argument. Seen on this light, this film does not seem to be biased, which is very positive and difficult to achieve when you make a movie around socially divisive issues."

","A straight man (a homophobic straight man, nonetheless) with HIV when AIDS was thought of as a ""gay man's disease"". A person with HIV in the 1980s, when there were virtually no effective treatments available in the United States. That's the nearly impossible position in which Ron Woodroof found himself, and it's his real-life story that's told in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" (R, 1:57).<br/><br/>Woodroof (a gaunt Matthew McConaughey) is a Dallas electrician by day, cowboy when the rodeo is in town and a partier – whenever. His high-risk behaviors land him in the hospital where he is told he has HIV, and 30 days to live. Woodroof does his homework, but is unsuccessful at securing a steady supply of helpful medicines, until he travels to Mexico and brings back enough for him and a few dozen of his closest friends, provided those friends can pay. Woodroof becomes unlikely partners with Rayon (Jared Leto), a cross-dressing gay man, who helps bring him customers and the Dallas Buyers Club is born.<br/><br/>Woodruff copies a business model, of sorts, that he learns is being used in other cities, and begins selling ""memberships"". Members are entitled to a variety of drugs and medicines (some natural and some experimental) that are not available in the U.S., but procured from a growing list of locations all around the world. Woodruff gets help from a local doctor (Jennifer Garner) who gradually comes to understand that he really is helping people. Woodroof, however, is battling the local authorities, the medical establishment, the drug companies, and even his former friends, all of which perceive him as a threat, for various reasons. Meanwhile, he develops full-blown AIDS. Although he lives much longer than originally projected, he knows his days are numbered and he wants his life to mean something.<br/><br/>The strength of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is its acting – mostly that from the two main characters. McConaughey and Leto both give earnest and heart-breaking, but somehow uplifting and definitely award-worthy performances. (Editor's note: Both men eventually received Screen Actors Guild Awards, Golden Globe Awards and Oscars for their work in this film.) Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for this film begins and ends with the acting. The story is interesting enough (not to mention important, yet little-known), but the movie drags, and it feels much longer than its 117 minutes. Its entertainment value, although bolstered by its talented leads, is still relatively low. ""B-""."

But the bulls weren't the only thing Ron rode bareback...he also had a craving for frequent and casual sex, at a price. Woodroof was openly racist and homophobic, who would be considered courageous after being diagnosed as HIV+. Angry and in deep denial after being told he had to get his affairs in order with probably thirty days to live, if lucky; Ron began gathering all the information he could about what would become called AIDS. It is 1985, and doctors have yet to have all the answers to the questions. Determined not to die of a ""faggot's"" disease; Woodroof would be enlightened that the new disease was not limited to homosexuals.<br/><br/>The drug AZT was known through clinical trials to help fight AIDS; but other experimental drugs were yet to be government-approved.

He seems to lead a life with little real substance.

Like the moth's emerged from caterpillars we witness in one scene, Ron transforms into a person who can surmount his former prejudices and accept others as valued human beings. This film is about the basic human needs we have in our lives, and we gives us a unique opportunity to watch months pass by in someone life. During this journey we witness the big changes that being diagnosed with a life threatening disease can spur. The questions like why do we live and what have given to the world arise.

After Ron Woodroof learns that he is HIV positive, I was in awe of his determination to find medications that would help him, as well as other individuals infected with HIV at any cost. Ron did not take his prognosis as a death sentence but rather as a green light to begin a search to find a treatment.

"votekpack","10","1","2","7 May 2014"," Watch this!
","Dallas Buyers Club Movies these days have become so overplayed, using the same ideas over and over again to generate money for big movie production companies and the A-list actors in them. It's rare to have a movie come around which brings something new to the table, a breath of fresh air. A movie that introduces different ideas, plots, and characters you actually care about. When you see these types of movies it really makes you ponder upon how many movies in the past few years you genuinely enjoy. I for one am critical about almost every movie that I see, so when one comes along that I enjoy it's exciting. Dallas Buyers Club is one of those special types of films. The type that amazingly render every emotion you have, because this movie is funny, relatable, and touching all at the same time. Directed by the great Jean-Marc Vallee, Dallas Buyers Club is about the amazing story of Ron Wooddruff, a Rodeo Cowboy/Electrician whom is diagnosed with AIDS. Woodruff is played by the impeccable Matthew McConaughey, which to my surprise plays this role to perfection! Given his past works have been cheesy romantic comedies, McConaughey really steps up his game in this film. The movie really begins when Woodruff is diagnosed with AIDS. Upon hearing the news Woodruff first denies that the diagnosis is correct and accused the doctor who ran the diagnosis of calling him a homosexual. Something important you should know about Woodruff is that he is a homophobic man, and back in the 1980's when this actually occurred AIDS was known as the homosexual virus. Woodruff ran with a tough crowd of friends who cracked jokes about Ron being a homosexual, and even vandalized his house with spray paint writing ""faggot blood"" on his trailer home. The sickness begins to make itself brutally aware to Ron when he faints and starts losing weight rapidly. Unfortunately Ron cannot receive the medicine being sold at the time to treat AIDS, and takes desperate measures to treat himself. Ron does extensive research of his own and what he finds shocks him. He believes that AIDS patients are not being efficiently treated and are being told lies about which types of medicine can heal them. This discovery turns Ron Woodruff the Rodeo Cowboy/Electrician into a leading AIDS activist. The character of Ron Woodruff goes through a transformation during this period, and it's what makes this movie a gem. The plot is unsolvable, it's unpredictable, but it's one hell of a ride. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, not another run of the mill."
"billygoat1071","9","1","2","7 May 2014"," Off The Prescription
","Dallas Buyers Club has a point about legitimate hospitals lacking legitimacy on their medical guarantees. Once the biggest pharmaceutical has become the majority's only reliance, they can easily manipulate their patients. Their agenda isn't the main focus though; we just know that there is a conspiracy theory behind the American clinical government towards the AIDS issue. That part of priceless cynicism instantly caught my attention, but the message doesn't aim there, because definitely this is a dramatized biography of Ron Woodroof who struggles with his condition and fights against their sneaky plan. Taking us to his personal realm is quite mesmerizing. Probably a little more slice of power could make it a lot satisfying, but the phenomenal acting and clever direction already makes the overall film gripping.<br/><br/>The very beginning already shows the example source of Woodroof's disease. In other areas of his life, he just goes through a loop cycle from rodeo bets to drug saddling. The guy doesn't seem to value his life until he finds out his condition after an accident at his work. The main arc of the character is basically how human beings will always fight for their lives, even when their luck has nowhere to go. The first act of the story is simply a powerful one, mostly because of the well handled performance of Matthew McConaughey. McConaughey lets the audience ride with Ron's hustler adventures and personal feelings, which makes a totally compelling character study.<br/><br/>The next acts finally follow the most intriguing topic of them all. This is when he starts smuggling the illegal-yet-functional drugs for the AIDS victims which leads to the titular club. What makes this effective is it's how straightforward the schemes are. The information comes around, but it doesn't over explain stuff. It just lets the audience casually figure out what both Ron and the hospital are up to. The film also has a sentiment about how unfair for homosexuals getting the harsh blame for the disease. Although it wanted to care about the victims, Rayon is the only example that gives all the sympathy because the rest of them are mostly faceless. Jared Leto is the heart of the film and of course he steals all of his scenes, in an affecting way. The direction is pretty basic, but the lack of grander visual flair gives real value to the character moments.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is no doubt a very interesting movie. Very minor things to complain however are the facelessness of the other club members or probably some subplots that deserve a more impacting consideration. Well nevertheless, it is still an engaging film, mainly about an unlikely determination to live even without much of a plan or ambition for his future. Plus a background of antagonizing a more authorized medical company that could be a topic worth talking about. Or that's probably just me too hooked with the subject. But really, every bit of it is just interesting."
"burlesonjesse5","8","1","2","7 May 2014"," A character study with rock solid performances that steer it to glory.
","As an actor, Matthew McConaughey has given some unforgettable performances. He seems to be in every movie these days. He plugs away with romantic comedies (Fool's Gold), recycled action films (Sahara), and forgettable sports endeavors (We Are Marshall). After he hit one out of the park with 2011's The Lincoln Lawyer, I knew he was on to something. Next to that screen turn and his unrecognizable yet memorable stint in Dazed and Confused, his mark as an AIDS inflicted cowboy in Dallas Buyers Club, remains his most stripped down, most uncoiled, most brilliant performance to date. As the initially unlikable Texan Rod Woodruff, McConaughey sheds all of his McConaugheyness and makes you forget that it's actually him, but rather a roughed up character going from womanizing sex addict, to self made man, to budding entrepreneur, to full on messiah.<br/><br/>Now ""Buyers Club"" isn't something I would throw into the Academy's Best Picture pile (of which it is nominated) but it's still a solid film. The performances are the key points here and this is strictly a character study. Along with McConaughey trading scenes with Jared Leto (playing a transvestite), you literally have blatant, thespian fireworks. Dallas Buyers Club is a deeply disturbing, momentously staked out drama that travels at a very fast clip. With the exception of an unclear yet contradictory ending, I'd say it's almost perfect.<br/><br/>Directed by Canadian born Jean Marc Vallee and featuring its star/co- star shedding what seems to be a huge amount of weight to prepare for their roles, Dallas Buyers Club chronicles the life of wild man Rod Woodroof (McConaughey). The year is 1985 and we see this man living on the edge, not thinking about tomorrow, and mocking the day when he has to associate with a same sex lifestyle (there is a discussion about the late actor Rock Hudson that enhances the proceedings). When Ron lands in the hospital by way of an on the job accident (electric shock), he discovers that he is HIV positive and has 30 days left to live. In denial initially and defensive, he parties like there is no tomorrow only to realize that his health is failing and that he doesn't have much time. After succumbing to befriending a nearby AIDS patient (irresponsibly drug-addicted, homosexual Rayan played by Jared Leto who gives probably one of the greatest performances in the history of film), the two of them form an unlikely friendship and build an empire based on selling illegal prescription drugs to other dying patients designed to boost their immune systems. When certain authority figures get involved (namely the food and drug administration and a conservative doctor), and their operation becomes daunting, these two renegades carry on to help the decaying breed to prolong their lives a little bit longer.<br/><br/>With a series of individually coarse scenes, Dallas Buyers Club (based on a long overdue realization of a true story) fails to possess a righteous sense of time and place (with the exception of some recognizable 1980's hair styles) but it does hit hard. Its fast paced yet sporadic narrative, explains to us that the director wanted to tell a grand true story without catering to how accurate the mundane setting is. He doesn't shoot things in an elaborate way and he doesn't concentrate on outside atmospherics. However, what's on screen washes over you with a visible dirtiness, and a portrayal of a forbidden lifestyle that grabs you from inside.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a powerful film that unfortunately ends abruptly while contradicting the effects of the drug Azt (which I thought was the answer to this horrible disease). Nevertheless, it stills draws you in though with its powerful acting stints coupled with the nervous yet confident desperation of its main character. ""Buyers Club"" is relevant. And you might look away at times only to ""buy"" into its lasting, exhaustively bold impression."

","The criticism that I read of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is that the hero is a bigot who sees his consciousness changed, as opposed to the gays who sought to raise people's consciousness. Even so, Matthew McConaughey does a perfect job as the fast-living homophobic racist forced to accept his AIDS affliction and starts importing AZT against the desires of the FDA. Other things on which the movie focuses include an immigrant who gets injured on the job but can't seek medical help for fear of getting deported. Jared Leto is also really good as the HIV-positive trans woman who helps McConaughey's character set up the buyers' club. It's a fine look at an era that ravaged the country, especially since AIDS continues to affect millions worldwide. McConaughey and Leto deserved their Oscars."

The Lincoln Lawyer, Killer Joe, Magic Mike, The Wolf Of Wall Street, The HBO series True Detective and now Dallas Buyers Club. Jared Leto, I know him primarily as the lead singer of rock band 30 Seconds To Mars. He was in critical success like Fight Club, Panic Room, American Psycho in small roles and he also starred in 2009s Mr Nobody as the main character. Dallas Buyers Club is where I want these guys to jump from, Leto I want permanently acting and McConaughey needs to keep the ball rolling, because he has made one of the biggest turnarounds of any actor in recent memory, no more Rom-Coms, from now on McConaughey is the real deal.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is the story of Ron Woodroof, and his struggle with the Aids virus. Woodroof himself is a very despicable character at first, the lowest of the low, he's a drunk, racist, homophobe and any of the old McConaughey charm is lost in his riveting portrayal. After learning of his contraction of the disease he brushes it off as he how could he get a virus only 'Faggots' have. He soon reallies that the diagnosis may be true and befriends a transsexual names Ryon (Played by Jared Leto) and sets up the 'Dallas Buyers Club', a place where all HIV Positive sufferers can come and get all the medication they like... for a fee. Woodroof see's this as a way to survive and make money at the same time but eventually, his heart, in true Grinch fashion' grows 3 sizes and he starts to truly care for all the people he has helped.<br/><br/>I don't need to say that McConaughey and Leto were committed to their roles. they both lost a dangerous amount of weight and Leto went method and didn't break character for the whole shoot. These guys are A level stars because of this film and I hope we get to see McConaughey continue this winning streak he has been on (His next film is Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan) and I want to see Leto back, full force, in the film industry, he has been away too long.<br/><br/>Why an 9 then? thats what you may ask, well because of Jennifer Garner. She was not good in this. She was monotone, boring, lifeless and i'm not talking about her professional scenes where she's meant to be like that because, she is a doctor after all. Im talking about when she's meant to show emotion, when we are meant to care about her as a character but nope, we don't because Garner can not carry the type of role she's not even trying to do justice to.<br/><br/>Overall, Dallas Buyers Club is inspiring, a story of a man who learns to love through his life threatening disease is what I took away from the film and the fact it won Best Actor and Supporting Actor for McConaughey and Leto is no surprise in my eyes."

After taking a medication, he ends up healing it. Following this success, he begins selling the medication to people around the world in order to make a profit with the help of a drag queen (Jared Leto). The performances were really outstanding, McConaughey and Leto did a pretty decent job with their acting and I definitely like well the story progressed throughout the film.

"Bunuel1976","7","1","2","26 February 2014"," DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (Jean-Marc Vallee', 2013) ***
","While this can be seen as typical ""Oscar bait"" material – dealing as it does with terminal illness and gender-bending and being a biopic on top of all that – there is no denying that it is a compelling and stylishly- handled affair (among the film's six nominations are ones for Best Picture, Original Screenplay and Editing). I had never been that much impressed with handsome Matthew McConaughey's work prior to this, given that it was mainly restricted to what passes for a romantic comedy these days; still, I am familiar with such dramatic films as the John Grisham adaptation A TIME TO KILL (1996), Steven Spielberg's AMISTAD (1997) and the Malta-shot WWII submarine flick U-571 (2000) and, for the record, I have yet to catch him in CONTACT (1997), William Friedkin's KILLER JOE (2011), MAGIC MIKE (2012) and Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET – which is itself one of this year's major Oscar contenders, so I will be getting to that one soon enough.<br/><br/>However, McConaughey's exceptional performance here really breathes life into a basically unsavory character – even if I doubt his shenanigans were truly as colourful as they are depicted throughout the movie! He plays a virile and hard-living rodeo cowboy who suddenly discovers he has contracted AIDS; after the initial incredulity, rather than wallowing in self-pity, he embarks on a private crusade to look into means of treating the HIV virus – especially when it transpires that the only legally prescribed drug in the U.S. was more life-threatening than health-restoring, causing him to go underground in other countries like Mexico and Japan and eventually start a booming business (which is what the title refers to) sharing his findings with other afflicted patients. <br/><br/>One of his closest collaborators is cross-dressing junkie Jared Leto (equally impressive), whose obvious knowledge of the gay scene – which McConaughey abhors at first but then learns to tolerate – is essential in procuring him eligible 'clients'. Both actors are deservedly at the head of their respective category in next Sunday's Oscar race (having already won the Golden Globe and SAG awards); almost just as assuredly 'in-the-bag' is the film's remaining nod for Best Make-up And Hairstyling – which unflinchingly illustrates the increasingly devastating effects of the disease (McConaughey even slimmed down considerably for the role). The supporting cast includes sympathetic doctor Jennifer Garner, Steve Zahn as the protagonist's long-suffering cop brother and a practically unrecognizable Griffin Dunne in the part of the discharged physician, relocated to Mexico, who alerts McConaughey of his alternative (and more beneficial) cure. <br/><br/>As I said earlier, the hero's brushes with the customs and medical authorities – entertaining though they may be, with the protagonist often disguising himself as a sickly priest – seem a bit far-fetched under the circumstances; ditto the unlikely presence of ""rodeo groupies"" servicing competing riders before entering the arena! Actually, the most shocking aspect of all this is that while McConaughey cleans up his act when hit by the disease – jettisoning booze, drugs and processed food – he finds it hard to curb his hedonism and still engages in watching porn, frequenting strippers and even make love to an attractive full- blown AIDS victimand Leto himself expires from a drug overdose! Incidentally, despite the clearly defined time-frame of events, the movie's production design (or, for that matter, T-Rex-dominated soundtrack) never really brings out that unmistakable feeling of being in the 1980s!"

"DarthVoorhees","7","1","2","14 February 2014"," Sensational performances from McConaughey and Leto but there is no conflict at the heart of the 'Buyers Club'
","I don't think Hollywood has quite managed to make a mainstream film about the stigma of being gay and having AIDS. 'Dallas Buyers Club' has elements which are utterly outstanding and I am sure you can assume that they deal with the acting. I am not quite sure if it is my personal desires of the film but I thought the film didn't quite explore the deeper societal experience of having HIV/AIDS. While there are individual strong looks at the character of Ron Woodroof I think the film fails to be about ideas even though it thinks it is. <br/><br/>The acting in this film from our leads is outstanding. Matthew McConaughey gives an Academy Award caliber performance. This is a role and performance that should be looked at by actors trying to understand the deeper nuances of how a character changes over the course of a film. McConaughey's exploration into Woodroof and how he evolves from being a homophobic bigot into a redeemed healer is really something to behold. I don't think there's been a performance recently that shows the evolution of a character's thoughts and soul as well as what is done here. McConaughey rightly gets a great deal of praise for the limits he pushed his body past but there is much more that adds to his performance as Woodroof. I love the way he deals with characters who are against his initial preconceptions about homosexuals and AIDS sufferers. Woodroof's bigotry is clearly a defense mechanism against his own deep insecurities. McConaughey shows the exterior and we see the facade fall. A piece of acting I think is often overlooked is how an actor reacts to his cast mates. McConaughey deeply listens and we see in his depleted body and face that this character is at a point where he must listen to stay alive. It's a brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is a chameleon and that's all that really can be said. I don't think Rayon is all that complex a character. Leto makes up for the script's shortcomings. It takes a really special performance to give a weak character the appearance of being fleshed out. Leto uses his body the same way McConaughey does. He obviously studied the notion of what it means to be female. Transgender characters are not touched upon by mainstream films because I think they are still scared despite the appearance of an open liberal Hollywood. Leto's performance is groundbreaking and humanizing. <br/><br/>Those are the strong points and here are the weak ones. Unfortunately the 'Dallas Buyers Club' gets pretty damn predictable as the movie tries to dissect the AIDS crisis. I think our culture does not want to look back at this time in the way we should look back on it. How society treated AIDS patients in the wake of the epidemic is one of the blackest and most disgusting moments of American history. The script I think leaves some things to be desired in the creation of the conflict against Woodroof's buyers club. The acting by the opposing antagonist played by Denis O'Hare is dull and so base that it almost feels like a made for TV romp. AIDS is such a charged topic and I wanted to see more about the conflicts it caused and how Woodruff eventually did become something of a hero. The only depth the pharmaceutical companies are given is that they are money hungry capitalists with the FDA in their pockets. McConaughey's Woodroof brings up some interesting points about the ethics of charging AIDS patients fortunes as they die. I would have liked to have seen stronger character development with these opposing forces and better acting. <br/><br/>Leto and McConaughey's performances are not to be missed. I think however that I and I am sure a few other film goers are still waiting for that honest and blunt portrayal of the AIDS crisis. The one which gives a nuanced look into the ugliness of what created the violent homophobes and the greedy people who profited off of misery and death."

","Dallas Buyers Club(2013) - meet Ron Woodroof a homophobic electrician, rodeo and a real-life AIDS victim given 30 days to live. He decides to participate in selling non-certified pharmaceutical drugs first given to him by a ""doctor"" who works in Mexico. These drugs help people whom are tested positive for aids. He finds a loophole in the legal system which allows him to sell these drugs as part of a membership for the ""Dallas Buyers Club"". These clubs took place all over the US at this time. He runs into a lot of problems along the way with law enforcement and the FDA and he also loses many friends. The character development in this film is outstanding. Ron befriends a transvestite man ""Rayon"" who helps him in his scheme to sell these drugs and Ron loses his homophobic views completely and becomes a better man. The acting is incredible and the story is very gripping. Definitely worth a watch. My Rating: 8/10"
"ArtandJoyofMovies","6","1","2","1 February 2014"," A 25 day film shoot and low budget came at a price.
","I know many folks will just freak out at TMG's relatively low rating for this movie. After all, TMG is a huge Matthew McConaughey fan. What he had to do to prepare for this role makes me admire him all the more. The story line is great. McConaughey's personal performance is off the charts awesome. There are lots of good messages in this film. So what is the problem? It is a movie. This is rare occasion I would say ""a book would be better.""<br/><br/>McConaughey plays electrician and part time bull rider Ron Woodroof who comes down with AIDS. Ron is not gay, but likely contracted the disease through unprotected sex or drug use. The revelation blows his mind and his friends away. Lacking effective treatment in 1985, he forms a ""Buyers Club"" to import drugs from Mexico and around the world that show promise to at least mitigate AIDs symptoms. He is a modestly successful hustler at this effort. Access to experimental drugs, not approved b the FDA in the United States perhaps helped some, but at what costs of false promises? It also threatened the tradition medical research community and government law enforcement. I admired the David versus Goliath theme. I treasure any small guy that stands up to big government. But a 25 day film shoot and low budget came at a price.<br/><br/>TMG always says the measure of a film has to be whether after the credits go up, can you honestly say you enjoyed it. ""Enjoy"" takes many forms. A film might make your laugh; another make you jump for joy; inspire you; thrill you; educate you; frighten you; or make you cry and deepen your humanity. The latter is where this film came close.it just missed. I walked out of this film feeling bad and no better for having seen it. Joy Lynn and I argued about this for hours. I just need to feel something more when I walk out of a film. No way would I sit through Dallas Buyers Club a second time.<br/><br/>How could this film have been better? A little comic relief for one. A little less stereotyping perhaps. (Not all guys who drink beer and enjoy rodeo are homophobic.) A little more balance perhaps. I did not buy into a successful, research doctor as hot as Jenifer Garner falling for a red neck, bigot with AIDS.<br/><br/>So my heartfelt apologies to Matthew for a performance of a lifetime for which he truly deserves and Oscar. ( I also feel his performance in Mud (2012) deserved and Oscar along with the film). A nod as well to Jared Leto for his performance as ""Rayon"" a cross dressing gay, trans-gender wannabe. Leto was more than convincing and reached my heart and my compassion. I still suggest this story would be better as a book instead."
"tavm","7","1","2","27 January 2014"," Dallas Buyers Club has fine performances by Matthew McConaughey, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Garner
","Before I review the movie proper, I have to give props to the filmmakers for making it so I didn't recognize this was shot in New Orleans, which is a two-hour drive from where I currently live. My movie theatre-working friend also didn't know when I showed him the credit that ID'd it and he'd seen this movie before. Anyway, I liked both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto in their roles and am glad they won their Golden Globes. If they win the Oscars, that would be nice, too. McConaughey's character may be something of a bigot but he becomes quite human when confronted with his AIDS treatment. And when he meets Leto's character in the hospital room, Leto becomes quite an ally even though he's not above telling what he really is at one point! I also liked Jennifer Garner's performance as their doctor and friend. The movie doesn't go for big emotions but it makes one feel for the characters, just the same. So, while not perfect, Dallas Buyers Club is very compellingly made. So, yes, that's a recommendation."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","15 January 2014"," Live And Let Live.
","Bolstered by career-best performance from Matthew McConaughey & another swashbuckling role by the ever adaptable Jared Leto, Dallas Buyers Club tells the true life story of Ron Woodroof, an electrician & rodeo who, when diagnosed with the HIV virus & predicted to die within a month, starts smuggling unapproved medicine into the country to help other AIDS patients when he finds the drug's effectiveness in improving his symptoms. The film also covers his battle with FDA over the corruption that exists within the organization that was built for the betterment of suffering people.<br/><br/>Smartly directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, well-researched, nicely scripted, steadily edited & covering the country ambiance pretty well, the best part about Dallas Buyers Club is its performances. Matthew McConaughey gives an spectacular but intricately layered performance as the homophobic Ron Woodroof and embodied the right physicality & personality to play the character. Jared Leto is one of those immensely versatile actors whom you can give any role & they'll end up completely getting into the skin of it. And that's what Leto does here while playing an HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, with whom Ron makes a business deal as she can bring him clients for the medicine, and gives a performance that easily goes down as one of this year's strongest. Jennifer Garner was alright as she didn't have much to do here anyway.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Dallas Buyers Club is a pretty good, if not great, motion picture that is greatly helped by the performances of McConaughey & Leto to be worth of your time & money. It might be disturbing to watch at times for some viewers but in an emotionally captivating manner, it shows the plight of people who know they'll be dying very soon but are still daring to live by trying whatever means possible. One never really learns the true value of his/her life until it's too late for them to get it back & that's what this film is trying to reflect to some extent while also making a powerful statement about the the injustice & abandonment a person suffering from AIDS still faces around the world. Give it a try."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","2","15 January 2014"," Moving yet unsentimental, with a towering performance from McConaughey
","It's hard to imagine a time when the words 'starring Matthew McConaughey' spelled bad news. Two years of wise choices, good films and career-redefining performances have turned the actor into one of the hottest actors around. Killer Joe (2011) and Mud (2012) showed his ability to play dangerous, mysterious and unpleasant characters while maintained that Texas charm and charisma. It seems like they were not much more than a warm up for Dallas Buyers Club, where he plays the skeletal Ron Woodroof, a boozy, cocaine-addled, womanising redneck electrician and part-time rodeo rider, who finds out that he has AIDS and just 30 days to live.<br/><br/>Initially, he reacts angrily, threatening the doctors (Denis O'Hare and Jennifer Garner) after they ask him if he has engaged in homosexual activity. With the knowledge of his impending death, Ron studies the disease. He cannot wait for trial testing of an experimental drug named AZT, and so pays a Mexican janitor to smuggle it out of the hospital for him. When he travels to Mexico for more AZT, Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), an American doctor who has had his license revoked, informs Ron that the AZT is killing him. He instead prescribes him drugs unapproved in the US, and soon enough, Ron's health has improved and he has lived way beyond his initial 30 days. With the drugs unavailable in his home country, Ron smuggles them across the border, setting up a buyers club for AIDS patients that soon becomes extremely popular for its terrified patients.<br/><br/>McConaughey's performance isn't the only one that impresses. Jared Leto, near unrecognisable as transvestite Rayon, injects a remarkable subtlety into his performance. Rayon didn't exist in the real-life story, and would normally come across as the token larger-than-life character that the Oscars seem to love so dearly. Yet the delicate tragedy of Rayon's heroin-addicted character combined with Leto's performance, is the foundation for Ron's fresh outlook. There's no moment of realisation where Ron has a U-turn on his homophobia, but his reluctant friendship with Rayon - and Rayon's ability to bring in the gay market on the buyers club - speaks louder that a close-up with sentimental music.<br/><br/>Jennifer Garner's Eve is also a fictional addition, and her role is one of the main negative aspects of the film. Not that she's bad, it's just that her character is overwhelmingly unbelievable. The film includes her to add a pointless romantic angle to the story, bowing to the familiar characteristics of the biopic. But Dallas Buyers Club doesn't try to tug on your heart-strings by blaring out a score or making it's protagonist reverse his personality. Ron starts out as a mumbling, racist redneck and ends a mumbling, racist redneck. But the energy he put into living hard, having threesomes with whores in coke-fuelled trailer parties is soon channelled into something positive, and his personality and sheer stubbornness manages to achieve things that most people could not. And that is a more powerful sentiment than telling us that life is like a box of chocolates.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","In the 1980's, I was an a knowledge hungry teen in Houston Texas. School did not make sense to me, and the information from my family life, and the education system, was just not enough to understand the world around. In particular, my education system did not even encroach on the happenings outside the city (Houston), and that was very sparse. Except of course for a special viewing of the Space Shuttle launch, but we know how that tragedy ended.<br/><br/>So, in my search for enlightenment about the life I was about to be let loose into, I found more conflicting stories about AIDS, HIV, Homosexuality and Drug use.<br/><br/>There where just as many stories on both side (true / false). I cannot tell you how frightened I was as a child, based on many of the lies about these 4 TABO's. These stories came from the school's, parents, and the co-works in the refinery/construction business I was in for many years in Texas.<br/><br/>But I can tell you, that it was strong enough to want to pursue the truth most of my life.<br/><br/>With that said, I was floored when I saw the performance that Mathew gave in this film.<br/><br/>The characters of his friend's, and co-workers where well depicted, and really propelled me back to my days in construction. As did their shallow minded hatred to anything different.<br/><br/>I was especially touched by the edgy comradery that formed between Mathew(Ron) and Jarod (Rayon).<br/><br/>I also felt touched by the initial disregard for life, or authority by Rayon, but later turning into self realization, that he is not settled with his inner daemons, and emotions. (too few in life are).<br/><br/>All-in-all, I give this a two-thumbs, and two-feet, and borrow two-more-hands from a friend to give to this movie. But, this is NOT a light hearted movie, nor is this an easy emotional experience. This is a realty depiction of the most influential epidemic of my lifetime, and certainly for the next few generations."

","Matthew McConaughey is currently giving the performance of his career in ""Dalls Buyers Club."" <br/><br/>And while that may not be saying much, since McConaughey's career hasn't exactly been an example of acting genius, I should add that his performance is impressive in any context, not just in relation to his own resume. He plays Ron Woodroof, a man who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and given a month to live and decides to take his treatment into his own hands when he begins to gather evidence that AZT, which was being pushed hard by the FDA as THE big AIDS drug at the time, does more harm than good. He opens up a ""buyers club,"" in which people with HIV can enroll for a $400/month membership, including access to an alternative drug cocktail. In this way, Woodroof hovered just outside the boundary of legality, because though he acquired the drugs illegally, he wasn't technically selling them. He was selling memberships, and the drugs were a perk.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" can't escape that syndrome common to many movies that are based on true stories -- the screenplay feels written to hit all of its marks and cover all the basic facts rather than to explore characters, themes or dramatic possibilities. If the subject matter is engrossing enough, this doesn't necessarily have to be a drawback (last year's ""Argo,"" for instance). The subject matter of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is certainly interesting, but it didn't have a lot of relevance for me personally. I was 10 in 1985 and the AIDS epidemic isn't something that impacted me or anyone I know personally. The film tries to beef up its universal relevancy by implicating the FDA in general and its focus on making money rather than on protecting the public. But that storyline is only one of many the film charges through to make sure it crosses its ""T""s and dots it ""I""s.<br/><br/>But still, it's a very good movie, and the accolades the cast is receiving are well deserved. Along with McConaughey, Jared Leto is excellent as a wayward transvestite, and Jennifer Garner, who no one is talking about, is quite good as well as a doctor who has misgivings about her own industry's practices.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a very nasty film. I am not referring to the fact that it's a film about AIDS--talking about that is important. No, I am talking about the style and content. The main character, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) plays a repellent sort of character and the film is certainly not one that you'd want to watch in front of your kids or your mother. Ron is a vulgar man--with a language like a sailor, a penchant for strip clubs and skanks and he uses ant-gay slurs repeatedly. Because of this, you may want to think twice before you see the film. Its also very, very unpleasant. I am not being so much critical as passing on information so you can make an informed choice.<br/><br/>It's interesting because I did a bit of reading about the real Ron Woodroof. While he was far from a saint, sources I read said he was not this nasty or anti-gay--and this ramped up a lot for the film. Had the film been less vulgar (and truer to the real character), it would have wider appeal. HOWEVER, my complaints withstanding, the film was made for a pittance, earned a lot of money AND won three Oscars--one for McConaughey. So, what do I know?! Just think twice about seeing the film--it's just amazingly nasty and isn't the sort of think I particularly enjoy. <br/><br/>So see it if you'd like. The acting is good and McConaughey did an amazing job."

The process by which a person must find credibility could be bought and sold, but it can not be awarded to anyone who has a God given gift (for which we all do). My review on this movie is positive, but it shows the success of only one man who had broken passed the barrier of probably our modern worlds most greatest flaw.

","Dallas Buyers Club is unashamedly accessible and formula-driven, while bringing to the fore various social concerns: ideal, conscientious, mainstream filmmaking, then. On the surface it looks like a kind of Philadelphia for the 21st century. But Jean-Marc (The Young Victoria) Vallee's film isn't simply a film about discrimination; it's also about the relationship between the public and Big Pharma, the ethics of controlled drugs trials, and the cooperative human spirit.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, the story begins in 1985. A self-destructive rodeo named Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) discovers he has HIV. Regarding it as a disease for ""fags"", he dismisses (and defies) the medical establishment's 30-day prognosis. He researches drugs - and alternative drugs. Woodroof becomes a dealer in non-FDA-approved medicines, ""smuggling"" vitamins and proteins from around the world. He then sells memberships on US soil, giving the pills away for free. Needless to say, a showdown with the FDA looms. Along the way, Woodroof befriends a transgender woman, Rayon (Jared Leto), and a sympathetic doctor, Eve (Jennifer Garner).<br/><br/>The ""McConaughnaissance"" will be complete with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar later this year, but this is the movie that could (and should) nab McConaughey an Oscar. It's not the best or boldest movie in his astonishing run since 2011's The Lincoln Lawyer, but his is a fierce, detailed, unsentimental performance worthy of recognition. Leto is very moving in the supporting role. Garner, sadly, has less to get her teeth into, largely reduced to a sympathetic sideliner.<br/><br/>Despite its subject matter, the film is not unrelentingly grim, and there are frequent bursts of humour, particularly in the increasingly tender odd couple banter between Ron and Rayon. It's a story with a natural drama at its core: two extremes (the alpha-hetero and the flamboyantly camp) uniting against the weight of an aggressive, punitive institution; a story that can't fail to inspire, provoke, and outrage in equal measure."

","After you've seen enough of them, you begin to identify their characteristics. There's this particular type of music that are tailored for the awards season, and more specifically, for the Oscars. They are released on a certain date, and they have a certain cinematography and editing. The plot usually revolves around a certain character that faces a big challenge, usually due to a systemic injustice (eg: slavery, or the way pharmaceutical companies make business with AIDS medicine), and in the process of overcoming this challenge, the character goes through a deep transformation and comes out as a hero. If it's based on a real story, even better. And this is somehow bothering: it's a cold reminder that after all, Hollywood is an industry, and within this industry there's a particular niche for movies that are nominated in the Oscars, who aim at a specific target market and make money out of priding themselves as ""quality movie"", as certified by the Academy. It's almost a joke the way in which the first ten months of the year Hollywood releases cr*ppy movies with weak plot lines and millions spent in visual effects, and then towards the awards season cinemas are flooded with allegedly ""better quality"" movies. Dallas Buyers Club is one of these.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, the Oscars do award better than average Hollywood movies, and they Oscar movies are indeed of ""better quality"" than the rest of what Hollywood makes. In this case, a special effort was made for the casting. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are simply superb, and they definitely deserve their Oscar for Best Performance. Both of them are unrecognizable in their roles, and they pull out an amazing acting when interpreting their characters. Of course, the role of a terminally-ill AIDS patient is specifically designed for giving the actor enough cues to pull out an Oscar-worthy performance, but it works. Jennifer Garner is not bad, but she is completely overshadowed by the other two actors. The story is pretty good, quite predictable (after all, the character is told at the beginning of the movie that is going to die) but enjoyable, and definitely emotional. So while you have to be psychologically prepared for watching a tough movie about AIDS, you will definitely not regret having watched this movie."

","I think it was only when awards season started that I heard more about this film, including the drastic measures two of the stars went to bring this real life events movie to the big screen, so I was very intrigued to see it, from director Jean-Marc Vallée (The Young Victoria). Basically, in Dallas in 1985, homophobic electrician and rodeo bull riding cowboy Ron Woodroof (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Matthew McConaughey) is diagnosed with HIV, he is predicted to have only thirty days to live, he refuses to believe this, but he remembers an unprotected sexual encounter with a user of intravenous drugs. He is shunned away by his family and friends due to his illness, but Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) assures him of tests for antiviral drugs, including one called AZT (azidothymidine) that could prolong life for AIDS patients, and the only one allowed for humans by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), he is also told the only way to determine if the drug is working is with half sick patients getting the drug and the other half getting placebos. Ron starts bribing a hospital worker to get him more AZT, but he finds his health deteriorating, but he is also taking cocaine excessively, he at one time ends up hospital again, and sharing a ward with and being hostile towards HIV positive transgender woman Rayon, formerly Raymond (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Jared Leto). He next drives all the way to Mexico to get more AZT from a hospital, there he meets Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), who had his medical licence revoked, he confirms the drug is ""poisonous"" and ""kills every cell it comes into contact with"", so he prescribes him ddC (dideoxycytidine) and the protein peptide T, they are not approved by the U.S., but three months pass and his health is much improved. Ron sees this as an opportunity to make some money, selling these to other HIV patients, with them being illegal he gets away with getting them over the border posing as a priest and swearing that they are for personal use, also Saks sees the negative effects of AZT to HIV patients, but her supervisor Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) says it cannot be discontinued. Ron sells the drugs from Mexico on the street, and after being back in contact with him Rayon becomes his business partner as she can get him more contacts, the ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is established with $400 a month membership for HIV patients, becoming very popular, and over time Ron respects Rayon and sees her as a friend. Sevard learns of the club after Ron has a heart attack and ends up in hospital again, he is angry of the alternative medication use and it interrupting his trial, and FDA member Richard Barkley (Michael O'Neill) threatens to have the club manager arrested, but Saks sees the positives of what the club is doing for the sick people joining, she is powerless to do anything to stop the laws halting the distribution of illegal drugs, but she and Rib strike a friendship. Barkley does get permission for the police to raid the Dallas Buyers Club, but Ron only gets a fine, but the FDA make it illegal to have unapproved drugs used, cocaine addicted Rayon begs his father for money to continue funding for the club, and sells his life insurance policy, so this allows Ron to travel to Mexico again, but he is devastated to learn that Rayon has died being put in hospital and put on AZT, this also upsets Saks, and she is asked to resign for involvement in the Buyers Club activities, but she ignores this and says that she should be fired. Over time Ron has compassion for homosexuals in the club, and he sees making money as a lesser concern, so he makes the drugs more the priority, but it is 1987 Peptide D becomes difficult to get hold of, he files for a lawsuit against the FDA for the legal use of the unapproved protein, explaining the benefits, the judge shows compassion but cannot do anything to combat the laws, the film ends explaining that FDA eventually did approve Peptide D, and that Ron Woodroof finally died of AIDS in 1992, seven years after doctors predicted how long he had left. Also starring Steve Zahn as Tucker, Dallas Roberts as David Wayne and Kevin Rankin as T.J. McConaughey, who lost over 3 stone of weight for the role, plays the man keeping himself alive and making money trying to help other people in the same position superbly, you see him as a hero rather than a victim to his disease, Garner is likable as the sympathetic doctor, and Leto, who lost over 2 stone, almost steals the show as the camp and lively but also fragile transsexual. This real life based film apparently took over twenty years and a number of attempts to bring to the big screen, and when you realise the drastic measures the actors went to for the realism it really does grip you, it is refreshing to get an alternative pretty much unsentimental view of the AIDS crisis of the 80's, with plausibility of homophobia and racism, all combined adds up to a refreshing and subtly brilliant drama based on a true story. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Very good!"

","""I ain't selling drugs no more counselor. I'm giving them away by selling memberships...you get all the meds you want...welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club."" Ron Woodruff (McConaughey) is a stereotypical redneck in the 80's. He is racist and homophobic, and in between getting drunk works as an electrician at a construction site. When a work accident lands him in the hospital he is told that he is HIV positive and has 30 days to live. This changes his whole world, his old friends are replaced by new friends, he changes his out look on life and is now doing everything he can to help others like him. Even if that means skirting the law. After all the talk about the performances in this movie I was excited to see it. They were great but I think that skewed the way people felt about the movie. I'm not denying that McConaughey and Leto deserve awards, because they do but I wouldn't consider this an amazing movie. Don't get me wrong though, this is a good movie and should be seen and I think it does deserve all the accolades that the actors are getting but the movie Puncture just had a grittier feel to it and I liked that one more. I know the two really don't have that much more in common then one man trying to change the system while dealing with a drug problem but that one made me care more about the main character. While Ron does have some good qualities that come out in the end you have a hard time liking him. Overall, a good movie with great acting that should be seen. I give it a B."

","I saw ""Dallas Buyers Club"", starring Matthew McConaughey-Magic Mike, Tropic Thunder; Jennifer Garner-Juno, Dude,Where's My Car?; Jared Leto- Lord of War, Fight Club and Steve Zahn-A Perfect Getaway, Sahara.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story, concerning the AIDS crisis. Matthew plays an electrician/part time rodeo bull rider in the 1980's. He gets some unsettling news after a routine doctor visit; he has AIDS and only about 30 days left to live. After the usual denials-he thought only gay people got it-and the emotions that most people go through after such a diagnosis, Matthew reads everything he can find on the subject and decides to use other forms of medications. They are not illegal drugs, they are just not approved by the US FDA. He has to travel to other countries-Mexico, Japan-to bring the unapproved drugs back and gets around the legal aspects by starting the Dallas Buyers Club-anyone can join for a fee and all the drugs are free. Jennifer plays a doctor that believes in what he is doing. Jared is a gay transdresser-he has not had the surgery but does prefer to dress like a woman-that befriends Matthew and becomes a business partner. Steve plays an old childhood friend of Matthew's, who is now a policeman. I read that Matthew lost 38 pounds for the role. It's rated ""R"" for language, sexual content-including nudity-and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental."

","Based on a true story, I did a little research and learned that the details in this flick are accurate regarding some of the legal and medical aspects, but some of the other plots and characters were for entertainment purposes only. Throughout the movie you can't stop thinking to yourself that wow, Matthew McConaughey lost almost 50lbs for the role. You kinda wonder if he was even feeling well during the filming. But after watching this I left the theater wondering why all the blame pointed towards the medical industry but not any on the consequences of personal responsibility. The acting from Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto is very good, the other smaller roles seemed like something from a B-movie."

And the film is an unremitting bummer, not that I insist on happy endings but...Jeez!<br/><br/>ON THE OTHER HAND -- Jared Leto does the best job of a man actually BEING a woman I've ever seen. So much that he's like the essence of woman, an archetype that shows us how different we are. Down to the last nuance, he nails it. And makes us feel it. A truly magnificent portrayal.<br/><br/>I'm supposed to put in ten lines of text or IMDb won't publish my review, so let me once again make myself perfectly clear -- watching Matthew McConaughey is torture -- watching Jared Leto is moving, unforgettable."

","Matthew McConaughey's performance stunned me, in a way that a beautiful painting does, where you gaze at it progressively more and recognize the depth and brilliance of it, just like that. Though I have to admit I have a soft spot for profound depictions of a character that showcases the multi-dimensional facets and leads us to experience him in a beautifully humane way. Ron (Matthew McConaughey) starts as this hyper-macho, intrepid, sexist, homophobic, hedonist that is addicted to sex, but as we get to know him better and the ravages of AIDS start to kick in, we see his beautiful evolution from a prejudiced, impatient, egotist to an acceptant, inclusive, and sacrificial person that attempts to live in an existential way. AIDS had to bully him into producing a legacy for himself, in an attempt to survive and find strength to live.<br/><br/>Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) was a really important element in the movie as the grim reaper for all these people with AIDS. It was the symbol of corruption, greed, and complicity within the hospital that Ron had to contend with. In the initial scenes we see Eve (Jennifer Garner) criticizing the brazenness of the pharmaceutical industry for pushing a medication that is not known to be safe for the public in order to make a profit, and Dr. Sevard gives her a gentle reality check when he justifies the industry's actions by calling it ""just business"".<br/><br/>Eve is the symbol of hope of reforming the Medical services, a young, good-hearted, compassionate doctor that is resilient and unrelenting despite many obstacles, even by the sexism and impulsivity initially by Ron. She was repeatedly Ron's hope that what he was doing was actually making a difference in people's lives. Even when he was not successful at causing significant change against the pharmaceutical industry, the people with him, especially Eve was there inspiring him to do better. At the end he did leave a legacy, a legacy of hope and perseverance, that despite any pushback he was relentless in his desire to improve the lives of others."

"inbetweendays-99648","5","0","1","21 March 2020"," A story of true grit and perseverance
","Dallas Buyers Club is a story of true grit and perseverance. The very intimate and personal journey of two very different men struggling for human dignity. Prejudice and bigotry are broken down as the two men become friends as they reluctantly work together to find treatment for people diagnosed with HIV.<br/><br/>In 1985, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was just becoming understood and primarily associated with the gay community. When we meet Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), we get a glimpse into his character and personality. He's an extremely homophobic hustler with a wild lifestyle of heavy drinking, cocaine, and sex. One day while at work, he gets called to come to help a migrant worker who got his leg caught in an oil drill and gets electrocuted. While in the hospital, Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) and Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) give him his grim HIV positive diagnosis and only thirty days to live. Ron reacts with anger and denies that he would have a disease that only ""faggots"" get. He goes on a cocaine and sex binge to drown out his emotions. The thirty-days-to-live diagnosis haunts Ron, so he decides to go to the library to do some research and realizes that the diagnosis is accurate.<br/><br/>After learning that AZT is the most effective drug to treat HIV, he goes back to the hospital to find out how to get some. However, the drug is in clinical trials, and he cannot simply buy the drug. He convinces Dr. Saks to get him in the trial where he meets a drug addict transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto) who also has the virus. He is disgusted by Rayon but now relates to him on a level he never thought possible. The trial is taking too long for Ron, so he buys AZT from a hospital orderly. When that runs out, he decided to head to Mexico to see a Dr. Vass.<br/><br/>As Ron is driving along thinking. We watch as he realizes the severity of his diagnosis becomes too much to bear. He pulls over on the side of the road. We are introduced to his desperation in this intimate moment. This is the first time we see Ron's real emotional struggle with the disease. This scene is crucial to help build empathy and compassion for because he started out as such a horrible guy. He pulls himself out of his despair and continues on. When Ron gets to Mexico, Dr. Vass gives him a combination of vitamins and other drugs he's found more effective in treating HIV. Ron makes a dramatic recovery and decides to smuggle the drugs back to the U.S. to make a profit.<br/><br/>Back in the US, Ron makes an unlikely partnership with Rayon to get the drugs to the HIV community. Ironically, they team up and become friends in their fight against the FDA, who continually tries to shut them down. Caught in the middle is Dr. Saks. She discovers Ron is treating her patients. She is caught in a moral dilemma. She understands why policies are in place, but sympathizes with Ron and decides to help them. Ron finds a loophole in the system and opens the Dallas Buyers Club. He sells monthly membership dues in exchange for free drugs. Ron helps many people in his last years of life and becomes a decent human being in the end. His prejudice is reversed, and he fights for the people he hated so deeply at first.<br/><br/>The first film to tackle homophobic prejudice was the film ""Philadelphia,"" starring Tom Hanks in 1993. Both films did a fantastic job of showing the physical toll the disease takes on the body. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto lost a significant amount of weight to add to the sickly look that was needed to make them look authentic. Makeup was used to add lesions and sores and to further deteriorate their physical appearance. Throughout the film, a high-pitched sound appears when Ron is very ill, and his state of mind is stressed. Dallas Buyers Club carefully crafts the two lives of two very different people coming together to fight for the same cause, breaking down prejudice and becoming friends along the way."

","Going into the film, I knew nothing about the story or the man it's based upon, Ron Woodruff, and to put it out there, I am a bit disheartened to hear and read that so much of the story is based upon exaggerations and outright lies, especially with two characters, Eve, and Rayon being complete fabrication in order to put the character of Ron into various circumstances and in order to show his changing of opinions and beliefs regarding those in the LGBTQ community.<br/><br/>With that said, I felt like the character of Ron in strictly film sense was an interesting one, and a few of his lines, were very witty and made me chuckle a few times throughout the mostly somber run time, which focuses on Ron finding out he is HIV positive, later having AIDS and how he manages to start this organization, The Dallas Buyers Club, in order to help people who have HIV and AIDS get treatment other than AZT, which according to the film is harmful and toxic to humans, while Ron's various drugs that he has acquired aren't.<br/><br/>The camera-work and cinematography are well done in sections, working to accentuate the emotions and feelings of the characters and situation on the screen, and the supporting character of Rayon is quite fascinating in her ability to be a foil to Ron's rough nature, with Leto's performance being noteworthy and memorable.<br/><br/>The film compels you to side with Ron and Rayon as well as Eve later on in the film as she breaks away from the protocol of the medical community in Dallas, as all three are seen as the underdogs wanting only to fight for their survival and the survival of so many inflicted with AIDS and HIV. Ron himself is even viewed as a hero, right until the end of the film.<br/><br/>I started off having a great impression of the film, but this is an instance where once I learned the real story behind it all, I grew to dislike the film and while it is a well-made film in the technical aspects, the liberty with which the filmmakers went with their portrayal of the character(s), nonexistent and otherwise, and the story itself grew to be too much and I cannot recommend this film to anyone other than for the solid acting by both McConaughey and Leto in their performances."

The superstitions against those who suffer from HIV, the homosexuals and the outcasts are the main subject along with the illness and the drug companies who would rather sell their ineffective medicine than have another one being approved.

The correct fact is that the early drugs were presented often by the media as miracle cures by the media. The fact is there is still no real cure even now.<br/><br/>This film creates a fictional hero that would have been a great person if he had actually really existed. It feels like he did because of the script writing and powerful script ending.

","A conventional biographical drama, Jean-Marc Vallee's ""Dallas Buyers Club"" stars Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof, a heterosexual but homophobic man living in 1980s America. When he is diagnosed with AIDS, a disease then stigmatised as being a ""gay illness"", Ron is subjected to the very abuses he once hurled toward homosexuals.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club's"" second act watches as Ron struggles to get his hands on pharmaceutical drugs which may help his condition. As the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned such drugs, Ron procures them through illegal channels. Eventually he begins smuggling unapproved drugs to other patients with AIDS. In doing so, he prolongs the lives of many.<br/><br/>""Dallas Buyers Club"" is primarily interested in mapping Ron's transition from prejudice to tolerance. Like the original ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, which gave chauvinistic white racists a taste of their own medicine, ""Club"" takes a homophobic and possibly racist rodeo cowboy – your quintessential Reaganite – and pushes him toward ""compassion"". In this regard, Ron strikes up a relationship with a transsexual called Rayon (Jared Leto). Though well-meaning, Rayon's character simply exists as a disposable plaything to foster the growth of heteronormatives. He's the fatally doomed queer character who's sacrificed so that the straight, white protagonist can find a sense of purpose (the film doesn't understand that transsexuals aren't the same as cisgender gays).<br/><br/>And so via Rayon, Ron shifts from skirt-chasing bigot to compassionate crusader. To make this shift he must first become anarcho-capitalist extraordinaire, a shift which epitomises the film's unabashedly American values; work hard, start a business, earn a cool million and you too can be an Oskar Schindler. HIV can't stop the American Dream.<br/><br/>Obvious, cloying, and mistaking excess for ""good acting"", ""Dallas Buyer's Club"" is at its best when it's demonstrating the sickening levels of hatred homosexuals habitually deal with. It also hints upon the xenophobically inhumane calculations of the decade's public health system, in which racial and sexual differences became synonymous with abnormalities and illness. The film also captures well the various modes of self-care that individuals infected with AIDS sought out in the early days of the pandemic, a time when treatments were expensive or non-existent. During this period ""buyers clubs"" - underground economies that proved to be more reliable than the exclusive corridors of government-funded clinical trials – became a necessary alternative for surviving AIDS. Though deemed ""illegal"", they'd become a symbol for progressive social movements, movements which flew in the face of the FDA and Big Pharma. The film co-stars an out-of-her-depth Jennifer Garner.<br/><br/>7/10 – Worth one viewing. See ""The Children's Hour"", ""Puncture"" (2011) and ""How To Survive a Plague""."

","Back when I was a young lad about 12 years old I remember staying up late one night to watch something on TV, during one of the ad breaks the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my young life came across the screen. It was the late 80's and the ad featured a group of what looked to be everyday normal people being lowered into a bowling lane as pins, at the other end a tall dark cloaked figure holding a sickle in one hand and a bowling ball in the other, the Grim Reaper figure bowled the ball down the lane and as the ball advanced towards a young girl she stood crying before being bowled over and then pushed aside as a new set of pins was brought down. The standout memory for me from that ad was the mother holding her baby and the way the baby flew out of her arms and hit the ground as she was picked off as a spare. The first time I seen this ad it shocked me so much I burst into tears and had to have my mum explain to me what it was all about. I had never heard of AIDS or the virus it was associated with but because of that ad to this day it still terrifies me. Dallas Buyers Club has been acclaimed worldwide as a masterful piece of storytelling, telling the story of a man and his life struggle when he learns that he has caught the AIDS virus in the late 80's. Ron Woodroof has been given 30 days to live his goal now is to make those days last as long as possible. The film is based loosely around Ron Woodroofs last years and his struggle against the FDA and the drugs available so he can live. Ron finds out that there are drugs in other parts of the world outside of Texas that are not legal in the USA so he does what he has to, to bring those drugs into the country so he can not only save his own life but the lives of hundreds of other people as well. Ron starts a ""buyers' club"" where people pay $400 per month and get given all the drugs they need to help them extend their lives. He meets Rayon a transvestite who he agrees to partner his Buyers Club with and together the duo do exactly what they have set out to do selling alternative medicines to those who really need it all the while dodging the FDA and their laws that have been made to stop him. Matthew McConaughey (The Wolf of Wall street, Magic Mike) stars in Dallas Buyers Club as Ron Woodroof, a rodeo cowboy electrician, the character he portrays on screen is phenomenal, the actor actual lost 21 kilos to play this role and it really does show. On screen Matthew looked shocking, the character he played was a sexist homophobic racist man, not a single care in the world but for himself and his sex drug filled lifestyle. It's not until later in the film where he meets Rayon a transvestite AIDS patient that Ron starts to see the virus for what it really is. Rayon and Ron become business partners and best friends as much as possible. Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream, 30 secs to Mars) plays Rayon, I found his portrayal to be a little stereotypical though, his walk, the way he talked and moved, don't get me wrong he was great but it did seem very forced and over the top to me. Perhaps that's my own personal prejudices getting in the way there, I can't really say. Once again though I will say he was very good in his role. Jennifer Gardner (Alias, Electra) plays Dr Eve Sacks, one of the Dr's in the hospital who is in charge of the testing of the AZT drug, the new medical cure for AIDS, she was also very brilliant in her role. It is a very heavy film, a heavy topic that most people still find uncomfortable to deal with including myself. It's not meant to put fear into you as the Grim reaper ad did but it does make you think especially if you have known people who have passed or who are currently living with the virus. I found the story and the way it was told to be slow in places, having a movie based on real life though can't be all excitement all the time. Personally I didn't fall into the story, I didn't feel the emotion that I have heard thousands of other viewers felt whilst watching. I found the story harsh and troubling but not enough to move me as it set out to do. It was portrayed exceptional well by all involved it's just not my cup of tea so to speak."

","Matthew McConaughey's strong, vivid characterization supports this film and keeps the interest going, even when the story can't always maintain interest. It's sort of a ""one man against the system"" tale, and so in that sense the main character, Ron Woodroof, was a type of hero, though also a flawed one (continuing to smoke, drink and abuse drugs even against his doctors' advice). McConaughey's acting is totally convincing and realistic and he deserved his Oscar for it. Jared Leto also won an Oscar, but for most of his scenes I kept wondering why, as it was a minor character without much interest, just part of the background, but later in the film his performance began to stand out. Jennifer Garner is decent as the doctor with strong principles (except for the fact that she almost dates one of her patients). Good points are made about the FDA and its too-cozy relationship with Big Pharma, a huge problem which still persists to this day. Worth watching for McCanoughey's performance."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","19 August 2014"," Funny, emotional and dramatic
","""Dallas Buyers Club"" has been the icing on the cake of Matthew McConaughey's very well-received performances from the last 3 years and complete career change after appearing in many not so well-received films and romcoms earlier in his career. It brought him a whole collection of awards including the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Musician/Actor Jared Leto meanwhile took home the prize for the supporting category for completely disappearing into the character of a transsexual. Admittedly, makeup and costume help him a lot as well and the character could hardly be more baity.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, of whom you may have seen ""The Young Victoria"". Here he has a lead actor who totally carries the film from start to finish, a truly captivating performance by McConaughey and he hits all the comic (the priest for example) as well as dramatic notes perfectly. There are still not that many movies dealing with HIV as you might expect there would be, given it is still one of the most frightening developments of our time. Maybe that is also why this film made such a difference last awards season.<br/><br/>Chapeau also to Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack who are pretty new to the writer's branch and came up with a high-quality script here. If you take a deeper look, you will also find lots of historic significance. One of these would be for example the medication scandal or another is the way in which Aids is only perceived as an illness that homosexuals can get. It takes a deeper look by the main character into the matter to read about the actual facts. This movie is a story about tolerance, changing perspective and true friendship (the supermarket scene).<br/><br/>The first scene of the film is actually a very telling one. We see McConaughey's character during intercourse with two women. There he risks his life just like the bullfighter in the background, possibly more. It's just not so obvious. Right afterward, the film seemed like the downfall of the main character and I expected the diary to run for the whole movie, which would have been truly depressing. However, it did not thanks to the medication and this made ""Dallas Buyers Club"" despite the topic an uplifting story full of hope."

","A Texan straight male discovers to have HIV in his organism in the eighties, a decade in which the virus infected almost only the homosexual population. So, considering also that the disease was highly mortal in such period, I can understand the psychological problem that Woodroof gets into. However, even thought the main character begins the movie as an extreme homophobic and chauvinist, things get better when he starts dealing with the transsexual portrayed by Jared Leto. The film shows an interesting ambient in which people were desperate to get any attention from the government, which didn't seem to feel interest for anything else than money. The script is original for the most of the time, albeit sometimes remembering me of 1993's ""And The Band Played On"". Photography and overall directing are beautiful and quick, making the story flows. But, what really makes this movie good, is the exceptional performance of Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto, who prove all their talent while portraying such controversial characters. I'm not of those that state ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is the best movie made in the last years, but it is surely very memorable and another mark for the genre. It could've still been better if there were more impacting scenes, but it never fails on being a sincere drama focused in past decades."

","The production values of this movie were pretty low. The sound was awful. In many scenes, the dialogue could not be heard clearly without turning the volume up so loud that the sound effects were overwhelming. It made we want to turn the closed captioning on, except the movie has none. The on-screen titles were also much smaller than they needed to be.<br/><br/>The story that is being told is pretty clear. Everything is thrust at the viewer in black and white, not in shades of gray. The FDA agent is made out to be a cartoon character, unwilling to seize even blatant drugs being brought across the border for purposes of distribution. It seems the story of Woodroof has been sensationalized more than was necessary. But this is in keeping with the filmmakers' (note apostrophe) technique of making everything black or white with no shades of gray."

There's a really good work from the main actors, McConaughey and Leto, they're two actors that really give everything (even physically) to portrait their characters, and that gives a lot of weight to the film and credibility to the story. I didn't liked so much Garner though, maybe in contrast with the other two she looked washed out.. More than the actings, and with all the respect I have for the subject and everyone that can feel affected by it, I didn't think that the movie itself was that great.

Not hardly. <br/><br/>This was a hard movie to watch. I can't say I enjoyed it, but I was deeply moved. I'm old enough to remember the AIDS crisis, which seems like forever ago now; I remember feeling slightly annoyed at how the gay community had manipulated the tragedy for political gain. I had no idea then what brave people were doing to try to and stay alive against the actions of the medical establishment as well as the government, which was deep in the pockets of pharmaceutical companies. This movie was eye-opening in more ways than one. I wish it had been made twenty years ago, when it was actually written. Shame on Hollywood for ignoring it for so long. Props to McConaughey for bringing it into the light. He deserves the Oscar, as does Jared Leto, who never ceases to amaze in his quest to get ""closer to the edge"" as an actor. Jennifer Garner doesn't get a whole lot to do as one of those ""composite"" characters that is mainly a mouthpiece for the movie's theme. But she rocks the eighties vibe just fine."

","I heard a popular entertainment announcer comment on Matts switch from ""hot surfer dude to serious actor"". Why?...because he lost weight and looked ugly and disgusting in this film? I would recommend she watch A Time to Kill-released in 1997. Mathew has always been a serious actor. He just happens to be attractive. And as such is treated like most actresses. Just like the likes of Paul Newman and other attractive actors before him. I think if there were more meaningful scripts written (like this one) that leave the audience with something more to think about than the stupidity of zombies and blood sucking freaks you would see more incredible performances. But an actor can only give what the script asks for. At least there are some good parts written for actors...actresses on the other hand have to take the same old T&A parts if they're beautiful women, at least for the first 10yrs of their careers. Anyways...this was a serious part, and hopefully it spoke to those who still practice unsafe sex as well as to those who hold the power of healing in there hands. This movie is worth watching, although the gratuitous sex scenes were too graphic to allow your kids to watch, which is too bad cuz it could make them think twice before..."

","Jean-Marc Vallée (of 'C.R.A.Z.Y.') quite craftily directs this well-written and efficiently-acted true story. The free-wheeling life of Ron Woodroof, a Texas cowboy and electrician, takes a turn when he gets diagnosed with AIDS and told to have only 30 more days to live. Ron, homophobic and racist, laughs at his luck for getting a disease which was mostly associated with homosexuals in that era. It takes a terrible disease like AIDS to finally make him a good and inspiring human being. The story is about his struggle and fight against the FDA to get proper medication for himself as well as other patients; it plays out quite well and keeps you interested till the end, starting from the stereotypes and discrimination faced by AIDS patients to the evil side of many agencies/institutions which are actually meant to protect the people rather than harming them, it shows how people, in their desperation to extend their life even a little, have to resort to whatever is available to them.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner together in a good movie, to help us erase our memory of watching them together in the horrible 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past'. And to have Jared Leto as the snappy but kind cross-dresser Rayon alongside them was a real treat. Leto and McConaughey hold the movie together with their incredible transformations and brilliant performances; their commitment to the craft is really commendable. Both the actors are almost unrecognizable, and we completely get sucked into their screen lives.<br/><br/>An intriguing and gripping story of medical activism; takes you back to the early days of the AIDS epidemic, filled with fear and helplessness."

","'Inspired from a real story' can provide the premises of good movies and bad movies, or I should put it in different words - movies I like and movies I do not like. They are usually good when they aim higher than replaying on screen the facts but also succeed in extracting the human truth behind the journalistic truth. It's not only an issue of credibility, as reality surpasses fiction in many cases in creating incredible situations, and real life characters can be extreme to the unbelievable in good and evil. It's an issue of adding that minimal dose of emotion that justifies the decision of viewers who chose the movie channel rather than Discovery. It's just that it must be real human emotion.<br/><br/>Combining docudrama and melodrama Dallas Buyers Club describes that moment at the beginning of the spreading of AIDS when no cure or even treatment to decrease suffering was available and the lack of information about the disease, its origins, ways of propagation was leaving space to prejudice. We still encounter this in some remote countries, but than, 30 years ago this was the situation in the developed world including main stream USA. Ron Woodroof lives the transformation between being the ultimate macho stereotype man, homophobic and ignorant to the stunned victim of the disease who decides to fight for the right to live his own way - which is also the way of the rebels in the American system in periods of pioneering. Actually America was pioneering new territory at that point in time with the initial initiative fighting not only the external threat but also the internal sclerosis of the medical and legal system.<br/><br/>Yes, the acting of Matthew McConaughey is brilliant and he deserves the Academy Award that he may get for this role. Unfortunately this is the only artistic statement of quality in this film. The rest is enveloped in a package of melodrama, with a script that does not offer any interesting or surprising development, and director Jean-Marc Vallee and supporting actors Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto not succeeding to overcome the stereotypes and the melodrama. I was quite hesitant to go and watch this film which is out of my preferred genres and zone of comfort or entertainment, unfortunately the reasons to hesitate were justified."
"pefrss","7","0","1","20 February 2014"," An unlikely hero
","I resisted seeing this movie because I avoid homophobic , constantly swearing rednecks in real life and had no desire to watch one on the big screen either. . On the other hand I lived through the second half of the eighties as a newly divorced woman scared to enter any sexual relationship because of that new STD, which nobody really knew for sure how it was transmitted. So I was curious to see how the film portrayed that time. In the late eighties I visited San Francisco on a regular basis for at least a few days every month due to my work. So I saw quite a few of these emaciated skeletons trying to survive and I remember well the stories about the non-existent drugs or much too expensive drugs. I also remember the fear in the Hollywood community after Rock Hudson died. People were afraid of kissing or even filming with actors who might be homosexual.<br/><br/>I have a few issues with the movie. It was a little bit unbelievable to me that this guy who lived in a trailer became suddenly a world traveling successful businessman while being at the brink of death. I do not think that in reality somebody so ill could bring up so much energy and become such a well informed person, especially considering that this was before the Internet and research was much more difficult . I also read that the real Woodruf was bisexual and married and his initial diagnosis was not thirty days only. Hollywood always feels that reality is not worth while portraying. I also did not buy that the female doctor would fall for the guy. <br/><br/>That said I have to say that I was especially moved by the performance of Jared Leto . He succeeded in portraying the desperation somebody who is going to die must feel. I also liked the performance of McConaughey, but I just did not believe that somebody like him exists. <br/><br/>In the thirty years since the Aids crisis exploded, attitude has changed and of course knowledge about the subject. We should always remember things like that when we form an opinion about anything. In my lifetime so many attitudes have changed and what was unacceptable is now at least tolerated if not embraced like for example gay marriage."

","Riding the tidal wave of accolades and awards recognitions, will DALLAS BUYERS CLUB assist the vehement renaissance of Matthew McConaughey to decisively harvest an Oscar statue as the top honor? The odds are very rosy and clearly he is the front-runner now, the only weighty competitor is his THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) co-star DiCaprio, whose overdue condition may facilitate him to snatch the highest kudos.<br/><br/>DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is a dark horse in the BEST PICTURE race and altogether it picked up 6 nominations, apart from BEST LEADING ACTOR, Jared Leto is also having BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR trophy in his bag. Both men's weigh-lost exploits are purely meritorious for the sake of taking ""acting"" with full-blooded dedication, which usually works every time, say Daniel Day- Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT (1989, 8/10), or Tom Hanks in PHILADELPHIA (1993), right, the film is also about AIDS, but Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is an out-and-out straight man, a dissolute rodeo actually, who is as parochial as his working-class peers, homophobic, ribald and unlikeable, squandering his life immoderately without repentance. <br/><br/>So, when HIV resides inside his body, as if the almighty God generously give Ron a chance to redeem his meaningless life, it is a customary one man's fight against the venal DEA, the monopolized pharmaceutical enterprise and the collusive hospital MDs, but there is a missing point, like many biographical narratives, all the achievement comes rather easily in a way that we audiences never comprehend what makes the protagonist ""the chosen one"", as for Ron, it is his macho heterosexuality distinguishes himself from the massive homosexual patients, thus the clash and metamorphosis is very theatrical, but how does he manage to be the pioneer in the business of illegal medicines deserves more detailed dissection. <br/><br/>Director Jean-Marc Vallée (C.R.A.Z.Y. 2005, 8/10) is not a novice in dealing with gay-themed feature, although DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is more of an assigned job for him, a light touch comes effectively when he wields the rodeo clown metaphor to manifest Ron's inner fear, surreptitious and hallucinating. The make-up team is quite praiseworthy too with so many damaged goods to take care of, the impact is authentically appalling. <br/><br/>From denial to acceptance, McConaughey unleashes an energetic personification with electrifying panache, self-destructive, uplifting and utter poignant, Ron is not a likable person, but in the end of the day, he becomes a better man, an unorthodox hero. Leto, on the other hand, sets an immaculate epitome of a woman's soul trapped in a man's body, his most emotive scene is the only time he wears a baggy man's suit to ask help from his estranged father, awkward and uncomfortable, his vulnerability is all over the place. Jennifer Garner, as the good side of the hospital doctors, is almost characterless and generic, a major disappointment in the storyline, her patronizing poise is perpetually obtrusive, it is a character should not occupy so much of her screen time, we would love see more of Leto instead. <br/><br/>It is never a winning battle for Ron, the obstacles are too redoubtable to conquer and Ron doesn't have the time either, we might wallow in the staged success, but the reality tells us it is a tough one to hem in the lucrative pharmaceutics within a modulated system, the ""life first"" rule certainly is easier said than done."

","I'm trying to keep a balance on Dallas Buyers Club. <br/><br/>The plus side is packed. Exposing the corrupt stranglehold American big pharma and the FDA have on the health system — that would probably survive even a functioning Obamacare — is as vital a challenge as any artist — or, dare we dream, politician? — could take on nowadays. The transformative but deeply felt performances of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are strong enough to crack the David Russell team's Oscar grip. McConaughey's reforming redneck is so compelling yet nuanced he saves the film from sinking into an Aaron Brokovich. <br/><br/>Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee does a superb job of exploring a social terrain possibly as remote to him as that of his The Young Victoria. One felicitous touch among many: the film's last shot is of Woodroof on a bucking bronc. The film closes on a freeze. By hanging up there forever he's an image of his last 30 days lasting seven years. But also—one life/death affecting the stretching future. Does our hero last the ride, score some points, maybe even win a few bucks? We'll never know. Because it doesn't matter. Just as whether he managed to transform the FDA into compassionate sense doesn't matter. All that counts is that he tried. He took on the irrational beast and did what he could. <br/><br/>But then there's a bit of a negative side. For such an important social issue, the film still seems oddly commercialized. Somebody's judgment gland failed when police buddy Tucker crops up every time our boy gets into trouble. Is the Dallas cop shop so small that one guy will plausibly be so often there? Those happy accidents give the otherwise well oiled plot a creak.<br/><br/>More problematic is the film's sentimentality. The film grabs every conceivable chance to wring our heart-strings. There's the ubiquitous Tucker's drama in the grocery aisle, the tension between the dewy-eyed Good Doctor and her Bad Doc boss, Woodroof's obligatory eruption at the hospital after Rayon's death, the gang's cliché clap at his return from court. I know this vat of sugar makes the social comment pill go down, but it risks acid reflux. <br/><br/>Why couldn't we have been led to think some more rather than just emotionally to gush? For example, are there not any reasons to justify the FDA's insistence on testing drugs before admitting them? Have there not been nightmare cases on the other side? Any criminal activity without the present rationalization perhaps? <br/><br/>While I enjoyed the ride as much as anyone, I soon found myself wondering what a European film on this subject might have been. Without the driving motive to leave its audience feeling good — catharsized, ""calm of mind, all passion spent"" — we might have had a film that provided a more circumspect and comprehensive approach to its so very important subject matter.

","The accolades heaped upon Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are well deserved, and this film is definitely one of the best I've seen in 2014. However, it is what I consider a weak year in the Best Picture category.<br/><br/>There are times when this film feels gritty and real enough to come off the screen, but there are also times the film comes across as a Lifetime television melodrama. The story tended to lose me when the ""big bad drug companies"" and the ""evil FDA"" were shown to practically dance on the graves of AIDs victims while lining their pockets and protecting their positions in the war to find a treatment. Just a little bit of humanity in the doctors and FDA officials would have gone a long way and added a bit of complexity to the story that was painted as all too black and white. It is harder to believe people do purely evil things knowingly, than to believe people simply do the wrongs things with the best of intentions.<br/><br/>That being said, there is plenty good to find here. The story is crisp and efficient, and the characters are all well rounded, believable, and compelling.<br/><br/>Recommended as one of the top three films of the year, IMHO."

","As a movie star, Matthew McConaughey is more known for his shirtless torso than his talent as an actor. However, in the past two years, he had been taking in roles that have been attracting Oscar talk. The association of McConaughey and Oscar was previously unthinkable. Now this year, he may just finally snag that Oscar nomination, if not the award itself.<br/><br/>Set in the 1980s, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is the name of a club whose membership allows patients of AIDS to acquire bootleg medications not yet approved by the FDA. This was established by the most unlikely person, the womanizing, boozing, homophobic, rodeo-loving, redneck drug- addict Ron Woodroof (McConaughey). <br/><br/>When AZT was not working well for him, Woodroof sought out a maverick doctor in Mexico supplying these experimental drugs, and smuggled them back to the States. Together with Rayon (Jared Leto), a flamboyant transsexual also with HIV, as his unlikely business partner, Woodroof fought the establishment on behalf of AIDS victims and their access to medications.<br/><br/>Jared Leto was unrecognizable both physically and behaviorally as Rayon. This lead singer of the rock band 30 Seconds to Mars had completely transformed into a different person. Leto was very active in films from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. He was in notable films like ""Requiem of a Dream"" and ""Fight Club."" His last memorable role was in the infamous ""Alexander"" in 2004, which sort of presages this present role of his. He has come back to film a big way this year in this darkly comic role, and may even be up for an Oscar nomination of his own as Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Matthew Mc Conaughey had been stereotyped into shallow rom-coms throughout the 2000s in films like ""The Wedding Planner,"" ""Failure to Launch,"" and ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past."" The awards buzz started in 2012 with his roles in ""Bernie,"" ""Killer Joe,"" ""The Paperboy,"" and especially ""Magic Mike"" all flirting with Oscar talk. Early this year, he continued his streak with ""Mud"" and finally this one in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" His physical transformation from his well-known buff surfer body to that of an emaciated AIDS patient was impressive, but more importantly it was his total commitment to the complicated role that may finally give him the big prize.<br/><br/>The film itself is well-made by director Jean Marc Vallee, with disturbing images of Woodroof's raunchy lifestyle contrasting with his crusading work later in life. But this film is really all about Matthew McConaughey and his growth as an actor. His performance as Ron Woodroof is the main attraction of this film."
"jadepietro","7","0","3","2 December 2013"," Tex-Mix
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>In Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey's first appearance is downright shocking: a pale skeletal image of this actor's former robust muscular self. We're use to seeing this good old country boy cavorting, drinking, and leading the wild life from his other film roles. But here, we also see the ugly side of this screen persona: drug abuse and rough sex amid bitter vitriolic and bigoted remarks. The actor has taken on the serious role of AIDS patient Ron Woodroof, a real life character who fought a courageous battle more so against the bureaucratic FDA than the disease itself. <br/><br/>As portrayed in this film, Woodroof is an arrogant Texas womanizer, a mean homophobe, a narcissist, and a heroin addict. He is a man with no moral center, no sense of compassion. a man filled with swagger and ego. Suddenly told he has 30 days to live, Ron lashes out at anyone he can: doctors, friends, gays. No, Ron is not the least bit likable, nor caring. He takes matters into his own hands: refusing AZT treatments, taking on the medical and governmental establishments, going across the border to get illegal drugs to help his immune system, starting a prescription service for his contraband, becoming a richer man in the process.<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, the film shows the prejudice against AIDS patients and clearly presents the anger. What it doesn't do is connect the political roadblocks and emotionally tie you to its main character and his plight. Woodroof's conversion from homophobe to crusader never seems real. It's as if some pieces are missing to this enigmatic character. Certainly, it's not the fault of McConaughey's gripping performance. The actor never plays it safe in his acting choices, even though the film plays it safe with its narrative structure and factual information. The screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack tends to overlook important details as its encompasses the years from Woodroof's initial doctor's visit to his extended and borrowed time as a political militant. Dallas Buyers Club just stays too clinical and remote in its storytelling of this 80's epidemic. <br/><br/>Woodroof's ultimate redemption seems to hinge upon his friendships with a kind doctor (a winning Jennifer Garner) and Rayon (Jared Leto), a transgender individual who also suffers from this fatal disease. Leto's acting as the self-destructive Rayon is astounding, even more effectively conveyed, although I am not diminishing Mr. McConaughey's triumphant portrayal with this statement. Mr. Leto successfully avoids the gay stereotype of the wise-cracking, sage effeminate and inhabits the role with a tenderness and vitality, and also has the necessary poignancy which he adds to the nuances of his character. The physical changes of the two actors, who lost nearly over 80 pounds between them, is startling and helps to give, pardon the pun, some heft to its conventional story.<br/><br/>Dallas Buyers Club is a worthwhile film to see. It boasts two of this year's finest performances and deals with a complex and important issue, even if the end result tends to simplify and gloss over its serious subject. GRADE: B-"

","Ron Woodruff, played by a shockingly thinned-down Matthew McConaughey, is a ""homophobic,"" rodeo riding, womanizing, boozing, drug-addict electrician, showing his true colors before receiving the diagnoses that he contracted HIV.<br/><br/>While playing cards with his red neck buddies, Ron's heard griping about actor Rock Hudson, the first AIDS related death to put the fatal disease on the map. Here we learn, in a somewhat forced manner, what kind of person he is or was. But THE DALLAS BUYERS CLUB truly succeeds at taking a trip to the mid-eighties, when AIDS was only linked to homosexuality.<br/><br/>Woodruff, basically given a thirty-day death sentence, goes from a bitter addict in denial to a maverick businessman forced to cope with the disease, selling a ""cocktail"" of vitamins and other drugs, acquired in Mexico, which were healthier and more successful than the government sponsored AZT.<br/><br/>On the forefront is Woodruff's gritty, determined persona, initially street-dealing and eventually getting patients legitimately signed up for a program (the ""Buyers Club"") to receive more helpful medication.<br/><br/>Too bad the film never fully discusses what transactions were legal or illegal at the time, painting the DEA as a one-note villain as Woodruff becomes somewhat over-glorified, without having too many obstacles, blunting both his roguish intensity and the needed suspense of a story centered on taking big risks, worldwide. Meanwhile the friendship between Ron and his sympathetic doctor, played by Jennifer Garner, provides an essential bittersweet friendship (a non-romantic romance) remaining bland and peripheral.<br/><br/>Oscar buzz is already being thrown in McConaughey's direction, but the dark horse candidate is Jared Leto's cross-dressing Rayon, becoming Woodruff's business partner, confidant and, ultimately, his gateway to understanding the lifestyle he once abhorred. In one sense, Rayon is liken to Tom Hanks' character in PHILADELPHIA while Woodruff, surly and narrow-minded like Denzel Washington's lawyer, eventually grows enlightened.<br/><br/>Though the film loses steam in the final act, becoming more of a political statement than a wheeling-dealing biopic, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB remains entertaining and enlightening the whole way through."
