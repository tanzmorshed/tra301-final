","Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.<br/><br/>What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to.  Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed.  As Willis asserts ""It's already happened,"" while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself.  It's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of dementia.<br/><br/>Besides this, 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.<br/><br/>Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery.  With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters.  The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination.  As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman.   Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist.  She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'<br/><br/>Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness.  Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"bob the moo","Null","140","159","13 February 2005"," Imaginative, clever, engaging and very enjoyable  one of the best sci-fi's I've seen
","In the future humans exist underground, the surface having become uninhabitable due to the release of a virus years before in 1996. The ruling classes are scientists and large sections of the population are held as prisoners in tiny cells; prisoners who ""volunteer"" to help work out what happened back in 1996 that killed off 99% of the population. Requiring information about the visit, James Cole is sent back to 1996 to gather what information he can. However, sent to 1990 by accident, Cole finds himself in a mental hospital where he meets From the very start this film marks itself out as being very much a Terry Gilliam product and those who hate his work will probably dislike this film for the same reason. However, pleasing people like that is not my concern and 12 Monkeys is actually one of Gilliam's most accessible films as it sets his imaginative style within a narrative that is satisfyingly complex and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. The story is not perfect though, the connection to the start is nice but the ultimate twist behind the virus just seems to have been thrown in to keep the film tidy; a minor complaint though because even then the main thrust of the story (Cole) keeps it together. The twisting plot plays with both Cole's and our sense of reality and it is genuinely gripping from start to finish Gilliam's direction is superb, whether it be the realistic world of the 1990's filmed with clever angles and shots or the wonderfully twisted world of the future, it is all excellent and was such a pleasant find in my local cinema at the time.<br/><br/>The film benefits from great turns from the cast. Willis was having a bit of a career resurrection in the mid-90's when several films showed us that he could actually act  for me, 12 Monkeys was one of them. Willis is superb as he spins from madness to sanity and back again; he underplays all the way and is so much better than the wise-cracking everyman that he is better known for. Pitt is just as good but in a different way. Getting an Oscar nomination that he deserved, Pitt risks overdoing it but pushes his crazy performance as far as he can without being indulgent  I'm not saying he is perfect but I would could this as one of his best performances to date. Stowe is very much in the shadow of these two but she holds her own well. Morse, Seda, Meloni and Plummer are all good in minor roles but really the film belongs to the lead three  Willis in particular and Pitt in a great supporting role.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great sci-fi; the story is great and is only helped by Gilliam's imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong, with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat, imaginative, engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam's films, it stands out as one of the best American sci-fi's of the past few decades."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","226","262","15 September 2007"," So you're telling me those people in the mental institution are... crazy?
","Just kidding, I rented 12 Monkeys the other day because I am a huge Bruce Willis fan and I heard some things about the film. Some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything in it: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.<br/><br/>James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send James to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more, and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.<br/><br/>12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Like I said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. But the whole movie was just great, the cast, the sets, just the whole picture was a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast.  Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss!"
"The-Ambassador","10","19","20","28 November 2014"," Pure Mad Genius Filmmaking
","It is unfortunate that all big budget films cannot be as good as 12 MONKEYS. But alas is that not what makes these once in a while films so special? Obviously director Gilliam is a rare talent, a treasure. But even for him 12 Monkeys outshines nearly everything else he's ever done. (And that says a lot. Brazil after all is another incredible film.) But this movie has two things going for it that ale it rise to the very top of the top. #1 it features a stellar cast who all equally deliver fantastic performances. This is Bruce Willis at his peak -- before he sold out and went all Die Hard, when e still cared about being taken seriously as an actor. Same with Brad Pitt. Many attribute this film as the first time Pitt showed the world that he truly was an actor and not just another pretty face. (He further proved that point in Fight Club and many others through the years -- Money Ball, Tree of Life, et al.) and then there's Madeline Stowe. Besides the stellar acting though 12 Monkeys accomplished something even more important: it gave us the opportunity for future films such as Memento and Inception. 12 Monkeys not only featured a non-linear approach to time travel, it did so erratically boldly dynamically and unapologetically so, allowing future filmmakers, like the aforementioned referenced Nolan brothers, to feel safe stepping even further out on those limbs. 12 Monkeys opened that door and so many others. This is a film you can see over and over and still see something new in it AND be moved by. A classic by all standards."
"nycritic","10","82","98","29 July 2005"," Trying to Save the Future, Which Is the Past
","Stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. The fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film. He gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy. His world, the world in which TWELVE MONKEYS transpires, is a place where the mad run wild, where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect, where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence, where madness looms at every corner. This is a very dark movie, but his very best, most linear (despite the plot twists which hold up under examination), and one which gets better with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>A tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of Life On The Planet As We Have Known It leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity's fate on the Earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the Earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time, among them one James Cole (underplayed to great effect by Bruce Willis). Cole could be any person. We don't know anything about him, but in a way, that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. What we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality: he may have already been at the scene of the Event of 1996.<br/><br/>It's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. When taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets Jeffrey Goines (spastically played by Brad Pitt, Oscar-nominated here) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction, and later Cole believes he has seen Goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? He doesn't know. Later he meets a psychologist, Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane, and that she's seen him before. This becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that Something Terrible is coming This Way, especially when she meets him six years later: she has seen Cole before. At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (Jeffrey Goines?) has apparently escaped, not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. The questions arise: have these events happened? Are they going to happen? Who is really a part of this, or better yet -- is everyone, down to the smallest player, a part of a Greater Plot? Or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which Time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again? <br/><br/>These questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece VERTIGO in which Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton mourns her own brief existence (""You took no notice,"" she says, as Cole and Railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in). Snippets of dialog from VERTIGO form a foil to the dialog between Railly and Cole and later, when Cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for Railly, he comes face-to-face with her in disguise (looking almost exactly like Eva Maria Saint from NORTH BY NORTHWEST) as the swelling Bernard Herrmann score plays the emergence of Judy Barton, dressed as Madeleine Elster. It's a fascinating sequence, more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films: Madeleine Stowe plays Kathryn Railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself ""Judy Simmons"" while helping an ""insane"" man named James Cole; James Stewart plays a detective who tries to help ""insane"" Madeleine Elster who will later re-appear not once, but twice, first as brunette Judy Barton, and later, as Madeleine. Action and re-enaction, play and re-play."

","""Twelve monkeys""'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. ""Twelve monkeys"" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in ""Die hard""). No matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It's got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, ""twelve monkeys"" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties."

","A convict from the year 2035 is assigned a mission in order to win parole. He is sent back in time by a group of scientists to try and discover the source of a fatal plague that wiped out most of the human race. A plague which did not kill animals. In his travels he discovers mysterious graffiti announcing the arrival of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam has always been an interesting film director and visual stylist even when some of his movies are uneven. With 12 Monkeys he perhaps produces his most wholly satisfying work. It's a consistently compelling mystery within the framework of a time-travelling sci-fi narrative. It's a fairly complex story, so attention is demanded of the viewer. This is perhaps the chief strength of the film, however, as the labyrinthine narrative is one that benefits from multiple viewings. There are still some elements of ambiguity even at the end, so it's a film that actively encourages discussion.<br/><br/>There's a good cast too. Bruce Willis was on a bit of a run in the mid 90's and this is one of the great films he appeared in at the height of his powers. On the other hand, it's one of the first films where Brad Pitt was allowed to display his acting chops and show that he was a lot more than just a pretty face. While in visual terms, it's as interesting as you would expect from a Gilliam movie; although not as phantasmagorical as some of his more personal fantasy features. In 12 Monkeys he was a director for hire but it's not immediately obvious. Perhaps the distance this gave him actually helped instill some discipline that made the whole more cohesive on the whole. Whatever the case, this is an excellent sci-fi film with a compelling central mystery."
"philip_vanderveken","9","98","120","15 August 2005"," This is amazing stuff
","Normally I try to avoid Sci-Fi movies as much as I can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this ""Twelve Monkeys"" I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...<br/><br/>What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.<br/><br/>Even after several viewings, I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. However, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10."
"j30bell","8","115","150","23 November 2006"," Full of Gillian-isms, Empty of Willis-isms - in a good way...
","There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled ""Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts"". It ended with a simple message saying: ""please don't do any of the above in my movie"".<br/><br/>There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.<br/><br/>I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.<br/><br/>Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.<br/><br/>I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.<br/><br/>Whatever the truth of the rumour above, Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I watched it again, I realised that it hadn't really aged. I had changed, of course. And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. A first rate film. 8/10."

","I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were ""Awesome. Just awesome."" I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so.<br/><br/>The story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. This film was the first one that Terry Gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. Back with Universal after his long, arduous battle with them over ""Brazil"", Terry had achieved what he wanted most; the ""final cut"". Terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.<br/><br/>The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. It contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called ""The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys"". It tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success."
"Infofreak","Null","115","153","24 January 2003"," A brilliant movie. One of the very best science fiction movies of the 1990s, and one or Terry Gilliam's greatest achievements.
","I grew up on Python and have followed Terry Gilliam's subsequent directorial career for more years than I care to remember. Half his output leaves me cold, the other half dazzle me beyond belief. 'Brazil' is his movie that I would rate the highest, but I've come to think that I have unfairly underrated 'Twelve Monkeys'. I have always enjoyed it, but I've only come to realize just how good a movie it really is. Sometimes I think it is even better than 'Brazil'. It's a close pick. Unlike 'Brazil' Gilliam didn't come up with the script. He basically was initially involved as a director for hire. Thankfully the script itself (by David and Janet Peoples) is first rate. On top of that Gilliam manages to stamp his own style and approach on to the material without sliding into complete self-indulgence as he sometimes does. The budget of this movie wasn't anywhere near as large as you would imagine from the impressive results on screen. It looks superb. Gilliam coaxes  first rate performances out of Bruce Willis (quite a surprise) and Brad Pitt (not such a surprise, see also 'Johnny Suede' and 'Kalifornia'). Madeline Stowe is also very good, as is Christopher Plummer, and in a small but important role, David Morse. It's difficult to fault this movie. It is a joy to watch, and improves with each viewing. I also highly recommend Chris Marker's 'La Jetee', the short experimental film which inspired 'Twelve Monkeys'. It is also brilliant."
"rbverhoef","10","44","57","30 May 2004"," A fine sci-fi thriller
","With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with time traveling. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories.<br/><br/>The movie constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and ""they"" send someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. You could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.<br/><br/>'Twelve Monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. You are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. May be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me."

","A linear travel within a non-linear structure. It's a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this come-and-go between present, future and past. However, the movie's linearity can't be avoided: it's the very work of the projector, the unfolding of the narrative.<br/><br/>What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world with little space for free-will.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic's prophecy, according to which a plague would rule the Earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus.<br/><br/>Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: return to the mid 90's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus. There's no way to change the past: all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present (that, for us viewers, is the future) find the cure. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the present better.<br/><br/>In his ""returns"" in time, Cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present.<br/><br/>The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect ""volunteers"" (this word is incisively ironic) to embark on the journeys to the past.<br/><br/>The scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel, and Cole ends up on wrong dates - this will, later in the plot, work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe).<br/><br/>We can see, through the evolution of the story, that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality.<br/><br/>There is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climactic - appears. It modifies itself, according to the evocation of Cole's memories, that come up in his dreams.<br/><br/>In an airport, a man is shot dead while running, armed, toward someone else. A blonde woman runs after the murdered one.<br/><br/>This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the narrative) and the future (adult Cole) Throughout the narrative, Cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist, doctor Peters (Morse), that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease.<br/><br/>What was can't be changed. And, in Cole's case, what was is what will be. Eternally.<br/><br/>A film not quite well understood for many. To me, nothing less than a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Other good movies with similar theme: The Back to the future trilogy (that has another angle regarding the ""mad scientist"" character, and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - particularly in the second film -, it is way more optimistic than Gilliam's work, that is an odd Hollywood picture).<br/><br/>In another register, there is ""Wild strawberries"", one of Bergman's masterpieces, that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences.<br/><br/>I've never watched ""La Jetée"", but only because I can't find it."

"Eumenides_0","10","19","24","20 February 2005"," Intelligent & Creative Science Fiction Movie: Gilliam's Best Yet!
","Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  I especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.<br/><br/>The story itself is engaging: one man, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. With such a complex movie, it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess, but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.<br/><br/>I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. It marked me a lot: I remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines  almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.<br/><br/>There are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. The twist is brilliant, but I prefer this ending for emotional impact. Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr. Railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense, the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.<br/><br/>The twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain. Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. It's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece."

","Great story keeps you glued to your seat. Representation is extraordinary. There are so many layers in this film and they have been coordinated masterfully so that their is not a single boring moment in this film. Bruce and Brad are fantastic as always. Put all this together it's a feast for a film buff. I never imagined Brad Pitt could pull a role like this one. I know he is a great actor and all that but his portrayal of that insane Jeffrey is a real powerhouse performance. The costumes could have been a little better though. All the scientist from the future world looks a bit of old fashioned. But the overall performance makes for that. Bruce Willis has always impressed me with his acting and this one is no different.

But good there is also a pause-button. Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the First World War and how messed up it all might look like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna be. It's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. One of my big favourites."
"dnjjr","10","9","11","18 April 2006"," Terry Gilliam's Mind-Bender with Heart
","NB: Spoilers within. This great movie is ""about"" so many things, all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story.<br/><br/>The ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! Such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot, coming from the magnificent work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker's ""La Jetee."" Without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. But there are many other levels speaking here.<br/><br/>The movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of James Cole (Bruce Willis, doing the best work of his career here). His journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again. The other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (the wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters. For me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene. By this point, James  once gripped by an unshakable determination  now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality; while Dr. Railly  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced, after absorbing James's proofs, of his horrific predictions. Her desperation to get through to James and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come.<br/><br/>Gilliam makes us care about these characters, especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives. The balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite. And the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through James's dreams. It is here, just after James has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind. See Jose and the gun (Just before this, the references to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and identity switching/confusion are brilliant.) This is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people; it not only holds up under repeated viewings, it demands them. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny, and suspenseful stuff.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent, especially Brad Pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as Jeffery Goines, crazed and spoiled, but ever the survivor. And there is David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the biggest accolades belong to Terry Gilliam, surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding ""Brazil."" (Lots of parallels, of course, especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings: lunacy within, lunacy without.) Every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone. The soundtrack is terrific, too.<br/><br/>This is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come."
"MartinHafer","6","32","49","21 July 2012"," Not my kind of thing....
","Obviously, a lot of people adore ""Twelve Monkeys"", as it's currently #180 on IMDb--placing it among the very best films ever made. While I recognize that it is an amazingly unusual plot (done before in the short French film ""La Jetée""), it just isn't the sort of film that appeals to me--though I generally do like fantasy and sci-fi films. I guess the film's weirdness and very slow pace just didn't appeal to me--perhaps you'll love it.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays a criminal from the future who has been sent back in time to try to prevent a HUGE apocalyptic event in which most of the people on Earth will be wiped out in 1996. Now I NEVER understood why they put the entire future of mankind on a criminal nor did I understand why they just didn't send dozens or thousands back in time to make 100% sure the plague would not occur. Regardless, he arrives too early--back in 1990. And, unfortunately, he's seen as a crazy man and is sent to an asylum. There, he meets a goofy psychiatrist (are there any other type in films?!) and a real crazy guy (Brad Pitt). How will these three folks work together to either cause or prevent devastation? See this film if you want to know.<br/><br/>Aside from seeing Frank Gorshin in a very unusual role as the man running the asylum, not a lot appealed to me about this one. I didn't dislike the film--I just never felt all that interested. Part of this might be because I never liked ""La Jetée""--part of it might be because Madeline Stowe's character seemed really hard to believe (sort of like Ingrid Bergman and her incredibly gullible character in ""Spellbound""--another goofy female psychiatrist with no personal boundaries and a tenuous hold on reality). All I know is that I wanted to like this movie but didn't. However, I did respect that it tried to be different and quite complex. Worth a look, though I can't figure out exactly what everyone loves about this one."
"Don-102","9","17","25","27 June 1999"," Finally, A Time Travel Story Done With Suspense and Originality.
","Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films of the Sci-fi genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality.  An apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 MONKEYS never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. Excellent use of Philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen.  He is actually sane, but the people of the future (or present if you will) distort this guy's head so bad through time travel, no wonder he unravels.  He gets sent to World War I just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the Army of the Twelve Monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it. They finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance, we get to see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and an ominous Brad Pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years.<br/><br/>Stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that Willis may not be as cracked up as he seems.  A captivating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of ""seeing"" each other before, in another place or time.  12 MONKEYS is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present, when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world.<br/><br/>The brooding city of Philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for Willis' plight to complete his mission which is, against all usual Hollywood stereotype, NOT to save the world.  He is gathering information.  The film plays tricks on the viewer as well, placing Willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin.  This must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but Gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making.  He even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like TIME BANDITS, and BRAZIL.  The screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films.  If you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS.<br/><br/>RATING: 9 of 10"

It compelled me from the moment it started to the second the credits started rolling. I've seen it many times and each time I see some small symbolisms that I didn't notice before, but I don't think I'll ever be able to grasp every single symbol that Gilliam put into this brilliant film. I'm honestly blown away by how ingenious the story is every time I see it. It's surely a science-fiction but it's almost like a thriller in the many twists and turns that the plot takes and every time I see it, I'm still amazed. The complexity and detail that Peoples and Gilliam put into this film is breathtaking. Truly one of the marvels of cinematic history. Of course I also have to mention Brad Pitt's absurdly charismatic performance which is among the best I've ever seen. Bruce Willis is also quite good."
"Spectator_Consumer","10","7","9","28 August 2005"," Is it Sci-Fi or Psychosis?
","The central plot of the movie appears to be Sci-Fi, but, in the end, is it really?<br/><br/>Ostensibly, we learn, humanity is nearly wiped-out in 1996 due to a super virus, so humans from the future send someone (Bruce Willis) back to investigate to supposedly find a cure for use in the future. This narrative unfolds as one would expect if a person appeared claiming to be from the future; Willis is put in a psychiatric institution. This is where 12 Monkeys begins to distinguish itself from the typical time travel film.<br/><br/>Because we are following Bruce Willis'character both in the future and the past, the viewer can't say for sure whether Willis' character is actually from the future, or merely psychotic. The movie somehow is able to maintain the plausibility of both possibilities up until the very end. Sane or insane, time-traveler or nut-bucket is what the film plays with expertly.<br/><br/>Theories abound to explain one version or another. My personal view is that a) you're not supposed to know if it's real or fantasy, that IS the point, but that forced to pick b) I'd go with the Sci-Fi sanity explanation. I favor the explanation that both the doctors/wardens of the future and Willis are caught in a temporal paradox which plays itself over and over, much like the movie we get to see repeatedly every time we pop in the DVD. Events are bound to happen because Bruce Willis is unable to stop the virus outbreak.<br/><br/>Some feel that Willis himself enables or even is necessary for the virus to be unleashed in the first part. This theory holds that the red head that steals and unleashes the virus is partially inspired from Dr. Railly's first lecture in which Willia and his buddy from the future, ""Jose,"" play a part in the Dr's presentation on the ""Cassandra Complex"" where someone knows the future but cannot change it. The red head feels the human race does deserve to die but is rebuffed/ignored by Dr. Railly, perhaps fueling his desire to disprove the Cassandra complex and deliver a world destruction he has foreseen. Theorists on this line also point to Dr. Railly's call to the Virus lab which causes the head scientist to give up security to the red headed guy, allowing him to steal the virus in the first place. The major problem with this theory is initial causation.<br/><br/>If Willis from the future is needed to create the virus dispersal event how did he ever end up a time traveler in the past to begin with? If he is needed for the virus outbreak, how could it ever have happened in the first instance if only the young Willis was at the airport the very first run through? <br/><br/>The better explanation, to my mind, is that if you assume the time-travel sanity POV, Willis must NOT be necessary for the virus outbreak at all, and that he once viewed the event without seeing himself involved, only to be sent back and become involved, creating the childhood memories for future paradox loops. By this theory, we're only watching one showing of the loop, where Willis is involved, but can't thwart the virus outbreak. The only major defect in this scenario is why would the people from the future send him back to begin with considering the final scene on the airplane where the woman from the future sits next to the red head and claims to be in insurance (indicating the people in power in the future desire the virus to get out...so why send Willis to investigate?) <br/><br/>None of the Sci-Fi explanations is without logical paradox, which leaves the more mundane psychosis explanation which, since it is based on logical/mental inconsistencies can explain everything by means of delusion. Sure some argue the bullet, the picture, the kid in barn etc, but, since we get the story through Willis we can't really trust any of it.<br/><br/>As you can see, this movie is complex and presents very interesting questions. Everything about the film shines as it uses the medium to create the two possible narratives simultaneously. This couldn't have been an easy movie to write, edit or direct, and yet all are superb.<br/><br/>Also one, has to point out Brad Pitt's role is perfectly acted. Pitt's performance is worth the price of admission or rental even had the movie been terrible. Not only excellent, but simply an amazing portrayal of an insane man. Pitt deserved an Oscar for best actor.<br/><br/>If you haven't had the chance to view this yet, make a point to."

I'll see anything by Gilliam... you know its going to be something interesting.<br/><br/>1)Brad Pitt's acting.  Come on, Brad... your character can't be THAT crazy? I would have appreciated a little more subtlety to his insanity.  This led the viewer not to take his character seriously (let alone a global threat). His acting was very over the top and ineffective.  Four years later he figured it out in Fight Club... in which he was superb.  Unless he makes some horrible career moves, Pitt will be remembered as one of the premier/bad-boy actors of this period in film.  <br/><br/>2) The ending... just flat out bad and melodramatic.<br/><br/>With some fine tuning, I believe 12 Monkeys could have been right up there with Seven or Silence of the Lambs as a great film of the 90's.  However, it just isn't."
"g-bodyl","9","6","8","14 March 2013"," Very Good Science Fiction!
","Twelve Monkeys is a very good science fiction film in part because it has a visionary director at the helm who doesn't believe in following the rules of cinema which of course is Terry Gilliam and also it has a very good portrayal of time travel which is kind of different they way it's used in this film. Despite some good, clever action scenes, this is not a straight-up action film. Instead, it's more of a thriller that likes to challenge viewers and that it does successfully. It helps that there are a few mind-blowing twists and turns thrown in.<br/><br/>This film is about a jailed guy, James Cole who is sent back in time to prevent a virus that wipe out the majority of the human population by 1997. He meets a psychologist and together, they try to find the 12 Monkeys cult which is believed to be the ones that let the virus out.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. Bruce Willis and especially Brad Pitt are on top of their games in the movie. Brad Pitt really gives it his all by playing a mental person with a weird imagination. Bruce Willis is really good as the guy who just wants to do his job and leave. Madeleine Stowe also does a good job even though I thought she was confusing at times.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good film both as a narrative and a technical display. Both worlds, past and future, are depicted as grim and dirty. It must have influenced 2006's Children of Men, because that is what the bleak landscape reminded me of. This thriller reminds me of the old Hitchcock films and the early Shymalan films with the kind of plot twists the movie has. This is a really sci-fi film and it holds up well. I rate this film 9/10."
"The-Sarkologist","9","6","8","7 January 2012"," Keeps you enthralled right through to the end, even if you have seen it before.
","This movie is brilliant, and I would say as close to original as movies go, except that it was inspired by a 1965 French Short film called La Jetee. It is a tragedy in a sense, though you are not quite so sure how it is going to end, though you do suspect that it is going to end badly: it is just one of those films. However, throughout the film Cole (Bruce Willis) has visions of a man being shot at an airport and a blonde haired woman running to him. For the most part we do not meet a blonde haired woman, the only woman we get to know is a brown haired psychiatrist (Madaline Stowe).<br/><br/>It is now the future and six billion people have been killed by a virus and the rest of humanity has been driven underground. The interesting thing is that the animals are immune to this virus. Throughout the movie we are constantly referred back to the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and are informed that they will release the virus, yet how can an insane boy create, let alone steal, such a powerful virus that will wipe out humanity yet leave the plants and animals? This movie involves a lot of time travel, and the purpose of this is to get a sample of the virus so that humanity may inhabit the surface again. Cole believes that he must stop the virus from even beginning, but that was not his mission. He was never ordered to stop the virus, just to get hold of it. As is said, ""it is all about following orders."" The mission that Cole is on is not the mission he was sent on.<br/><br/>The time travel doesn't work fully. People are sent back in time but in most cases they do not get to the time they are supposed to. Cole, at first, is sent back to 1990 instead of 1996, and lands up in a mental hospital. This is very dark and dirty and really underlines the horror of humanity. Jeffery Goines (Brad Pitt) gives us a definition of insanity here, and that is not following what the majority follows. The world is a world of majority rules, and if you don't follow the majority then you are considered mentally ill. This is very true, just look around and see how minorities are treated. I remember a time (and it still is) when you were a geek if you used a computer.<br/><br/>The Cassandra Syndrome is brought up, and is connected with the prophets of doom that are appearing more and more rapidly the closer one gets to 1996. They are warning the world of the disease, the passage from Revelation where the angel pours the bowl of disease upon the world is read out a number of times, but nobody ever believes them. Nobody wants to believe that the world that they love is coming to an end. Yet belief and reality seem to play a very major part in this movie, especially around Cole. At the start he believes that the world will end and that his future is the present, but the more time he spends in 1996 and the more time he spends with Katherine Raily (Madeline Stowe), the more his sense of reality becomes twisted. The last time he visits the future, he enters it as a dream and returns to 1996 as reality. By the end of the movie, in Cole's mind, the whole virus is something that comes from the mouth of a mad man. Yet the more he tries to deny what is happening, the more the evidence piles up to prove to him that what is going to happen is true.<br/><br/>Erbert brings up the style of the movie and the scenes that it is filmed around. Almost everything in the movie is dirty, decaying, and falling apart. We catch glimpses of skyscrapers and the beauty of civilisation, but are brought into the reality of the slums and vagrants. The future is not something to look forward to, but rather something to shun, and the most important part is that it cannot be changed. Cole says ""it is like a movie that you have already seen, you know what is going to happen, but every time you see it, you notice different things."" So true, he realises that he knows what will happen, he has seen it, and he knows that even if he tries to stop it, it is only bringing him closer to his doom.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is a movie that portrays the bleakness of the human existence. Though there are a few that live lives of luxury, to the majority, it is a bleak world falling closer to destruction. Cole says that he wants to make 1996 his reality, but as we look around at what Gilliam shows us, there is very little to distinguish it from his future. There is still a race of overseers and underlings, the virus just causes the balance of power to shift in another direction."
"Chandler81","9","6","8","24 October 2002"," Inspired Insanity
","12 Monkeys is a rare treat that diverts from the traditional Hollywood fare one might expect from the film, being directed by Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python fame) and starring big-name Hollywood stars Willis and Pitt. However, rather than tell a 'time travel' story that deals with consequence and effect, 12 Monkeys instead tells an ambiguous tale of a central character walking a fine line between reality and insanity.  The viewer can easily make a conscious decision while watching the film to buy into the time-travel story and Cole's plight, or they can interpret the film as the delusional visions of a clinically insane man.  Gilliam's fantastic work offers evidence to support both interpretations, and the film can be enjoyed many times as the viewer picks up the many clues to determine their own interpretation of the events.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic; Willis plays Cole with both alarming savagery and arresting sincerity.  Stowe is as talented as she is hauntingly beautiful, and her role as the non-believer gradually accepting an unbelievable reality becomes increasingly compelling, as we see her own grip on reality crumble as Cole's does.  Pitt is outstanding; his delivery of complicated machine-gun dialogue is both funny and disturbing, and although his character takes a back seat for a large portion of the film, he nonetheless greatly enhances the film with his presence.<br/><br/>12 Monkeys isn't a film that has broad appeal.  Its imagery is largely very gritty and dirty - a stark contrast to the early scenes that are exceptionally stale - its story ambiguous, and there are plenty of simply bizarre scenes and characters.  Still, it is a film that will reward the patient viewer with a clever and moving vision of a tortured soul and his heartbreaking struggle."

","'Twelve Monkeys' is a film which has a certain audience. It's a shame Terry Gilliam's films don't have as big a fan-base as other types of film and director but his fans are loyal.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Bruce Willis' flashback and him waking up in this strange prison-like place which automatically frightens you, the first half hour of the film is like this. One particular part is when Willis is walking through the abandoned shopping centre, it's a very atmospheric film. <br/><br/>The plot is very interesting, it can become quite confusing at some points but, as with a lot of Gilliam's films, it all ties together at the end. The camera-work in this film works really well and provides a lot of the atmosphere and tension in the film's plot. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is pretty good. The two main strengths in this film are of course Willis and Brad Pitt. Bruce Willis is an actors who has been type-cast unfortunately but this film broke the mould. He does not do any typical Willis-like actions and although he is the film's protagonist, he doesn't seem that way at all in this, he portrays a muddled, odd person who eventually tries to save the day. Brad Pitt is astonishing, it's the best I have ever seen him perform. It shows how great he really is as an actor and he's not just a pretty face.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film if you have seen a Gilliam film before and enjoyed it. If you have never liked any of his films you will probably not like this one. If you've never seen any then at least give this film a chance, it deserves a lot more credit than it received."

","Terry Gilliam has made a career of trying to make films markedly different from the mainstream. That's a riskier career path than following the trails everyone else is using. It's neither more nor less commendable, although there are those who worship distinction for it's own stake.<br/><br/>A good movie is worth watching whether it's original or derivative and a bad movie is still a bad movie even if it's uniquely bad.<br/><br/>Gilliams record, apart from his Monty Python related work, includes the enjoyable TIME BANDITS, and BRAZIL, a masterpiece, IMO. BARON MUNCHHAUSEN is, perhaps, better left in the bin along with the careers of the executives who green-lighted the project.<br/><br/>TWELVE MONKEYS is, like BRAZIL, an essay in dystopia. Both movies revolve around malfunctioning societies. In the world of BRAZIL, we have a parallel universe which crosses 1930s-style fascism with an unmistakable Monty Pythonesque sensibility. In TWELVE MONKEYS, it's a future in which humanity is driven into a quasi-police state in a world dying from the results of bioterrorism.<br/><br/>Also like BRAZIL, TWELVE MONKEYS focuses on the efforts of an inhabitant of the dystopia to escape. In BRAZIL, the escape is retreat into a fantasy world. In TWELVE MONKEYS, a literal escape into the past is paralleled by an attempt by the protagonist, played by Bruce Willis, to destroy the dystopian future by preventing the event which causes it's creation.<br/><br/>In both films, the theme is that escape is impossible. But, TWELVE MONKEYS takes a very different tone from BRAZIL, where the fantasy interludes were at least partly light, if always ending in frustration. And, even though the world of BRAZIL was ugly, the film took such an offbeat look at it that there was humor relieving what ought, when all the decorations are stripped away, have been a depressing reaction. TWELVE MONKEYS is not funny. It's dystopia is offered up more or less straight, so the future world scenes set an ugly tone.<br/><br/>The present world scenes do not copy the light tone of the fantasy scenes of BRAZIL, either. They are more ""realistic"" then their future world counterparts, but not really lighter in feel.<br/><br/>As a result, whatever other merits TWELVE MONKEYS has, it tends to be a dark, dissonant piece. <br/><br/>As others have written, it attempts, in part, at least, to be an art film. And, it takes a relatively difficult plot concept, which is bound to alienate and lose some of the people who watch it. Essentially, it's a - fairly trivial - argument about predestination, and the absence of free will. The end is inevitable, despite the protagonist's best efforts to change it. <br/><br/>Alternatively, one might view the whole film as an exercise in solipsism, if the Bruce Willis character is seen as insane and hallucinating the entire plot.<br/><br/>Either way, frankly, there a bit of the air of a freshman dormitory in a liberal arts college to the piece. An impassioned argument over a philosophical issue by people who feel more deeply than they think.<br/><br/>However, the plot is well thought out and consistent.The outcome follows from the premises and the internal logic of the plot is, well, logical. The ending is not just grafted on. It's a - if not necessarily ""the"" - natural outcome of all which went before it. If one is attracted to the ""coming full circle"" aesthetic of story telling, there's not much to complain about.<br/><br/>The acting is good, especially both Bruce Willis, as the put-upon everyman, and Brad Pitt, in one of the most odd, yet compelling, roles of his career.<br/><br/>All in all, an interesting movie. Not one to come to looking for laughs. It requires some effort, and it's depressing. But, entertaining, to a degree.<br/><br/>The Winona Ryder character, from BEETLEJUICE, would love it.<br/><br/>bsl"

","""12 Monkeys"" is the best cinematic sci-fi I have seen since Blade Runner (1982); and it is no co-incidence that it was scripted in part by the gifted David Peoples who helped write the screen play for Blade Runner. Never mind that time travel to the past is an absurdity. We're forced to rise above that because Gilliam presents time similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut did in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), namely that all time is happening ""simultaneously"" and especially right now, forever.<br/><br/>We are reminded that time is an illusion. Our experience and perception of time is, as it were, linear, allowing us a comprehension of ""time"" similar to what two-dimensional creatures might have of three dimensional space. ""Time"" does not exist. It is a construct from the way we compare events. Notice that when James Cole dies Dr. Railly is not sad because Cole lives on in the person of his younger self, the child at the airport watching his death. This will be the case for eternity.<br/><br/>There are some funny bits in the script. After Cole beats up the pimp to save Dr. Railly, and forces a trade of teeth (to evade the trackers implanted in his teeth), and the cops come, the pimp says, all hurt, ""I was attacked by a coked-up whore and a crazy dentist."" Another nice touch is to have the virologist father of crazy/visionary Jeffrey Goines sound like a southern politician instead of your usual mad scientist. I also liked it when psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly said, ""Psychiatry is the latest religion...I'm in trouble. I'm losing my faith."" She's right: psychiatry and clinical psychology in general is a secular religion."

","I knew Terry Gilliam's movies were all but predictable, but I had to see Twelve Monkeys in order to truly believe it.This is the only Gilliam movie I've seen so far, but it blew me away so much he's already one of my favorite filmmakers.<br/><br/>The story may seem a little bit classic(a man is sent back in time to stop a disaster), but Gilliam immediately makes it original:convict James Cole(Bruce Willis) ends up a few years before the plague breaks loose, so no one believes him and he's locked up in an asylum.He has to convince Dr.Railly(Madeleine Stowe)he's not crazy, while he spends his time with ""fellow"" nut-case Jeffrey Goines(Brad Pitt).The Twelve Monkeys have to be stopped...<br/><br/>If you thought you knew what dark sci-fi flicks are like, think again.In terms of atmosphere, this is a perfect mix of Blade Runner and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest(the asylum riot is visually great). The script is incredibly good, and the same is to be said about the performances:Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt are amazing(the latter was Oscar-nominated for this role), playing two guys they wouldn't be associated with under the normal circumstances.But when we're talking about Terry Gilliam, can there actually be any normal circumstances?"
"moviemanMA","8","4","5","10 July 2005"," There's no monkeying around when it comes to this movie
","Terry Gilliam is one of the original six members of the Monty Python cast. His works include Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life, where he helped direct two and helped write all of them. He also directed Jabberwocky where he used Lewis Carrol's poem and some of his Monty Python buddies to make a movie. In 1995, he decided to make a movie that was a little bit different.<br/><br/>Inspired by a previous film called La Jetee, Twelve Monkeys is a science fiction thriller/drama that revolves around James Cole played by Bruce Willis. This man has ""volunteered"" to go back in time to try and stop deadly virus from spreading, killing five billion people and leaving the animals in charge on the surface. He is first sent to the wrong time period, 1990. His destination was supposed to be 1996. Instead he winds up staying in a mental hospital. He becomes allies with a crazy man by the name of Jeffrey Goines. Brad Pitt is wonderful as this ""nutty"" of a character. His portrayal of Jefferey gave him an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>What happens now is Bruce is transported finally to the right time period, after being brought back from the mental hospital. Now he must use his psychiatrist from the mental hospital, Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and her car to try and stop the virus from getting out into the open. Cole must now find out if what he thinks is reality is just all in his head and he really isn't being brought back and forth from the present to the past, or as Railly sees it, from the future back to the present.<br/><br/>This story is very well written. Writer David Webb Peoples is no rookie when it comes to writing a screenplay. His previous triumphs were Blade Runner, thought to be one of the best science fiction movies of all time, and Unforgiven where he received an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is a great movie you can watch over and over again and still find something to like. Whether it is Brad Pitt giving his best performance ever on film, or just the plot and how Gilliam illustrates it for us, this movie is a classic. There's no monkeying around when it comes to this movie"
"Thomas-Giffin","9","5","7","16 April 2012"," A stunningly good film!
","Now this is a beautiful, twisted piece of genius.<br/><br/>Easily the best thing that Terry Gilliam has directed (if you disagree, you're wrong!), this film is incredibly well directed, insanely well acted and a story that demands attention and rewards what attention you give it.<br/><br/>The story is time-travel at its core. It cleverly removes a time-travel paradox by not sending Bruce Willis back in time to change the future, instead he is simply told to observe and gather information to help the future repair and rebuild. By removing the idea of James Cole (Willis) having to 'save' the world, the emphasis is instead on the futility of life in 1996. The narrative contains many setbacks and tiny scenes and moments which mean nothing in themselves but each comes back with massive force and power by the time the credits role. It's a marvellous piece of storytelling and an exercise in how to tell a non-linear, confusing story and simply and as stylishly as possible.<br/><br/>By the way, I have never seen Bruce Willis on such form, ever. He is strong, resilient but he conveys such weakness at times, it's amazing. His James Cole is often as confused as we are but towards the end starts to build up incorrect ideas with such conviction and sense that we (as viewers) wonder if and how the carpet will be taken form under our feet. Madeleine Stowe gives her Kathryn Railly a fierce intelligence and charisma which remains a constant throughout the film. Brad Pitt is on top form too as the slightly odd (to put it lightly) Jeffrey Goines, with similar characteristics and ideals to one of his more iconic roles, Tyler Durden (Fight Club).<br/><br/>On top of all the praise I've given it so far, it has a charming tie-in to several Hitchcock films (most notably Vertigo) in a similar way to La Jetee, the film that inspired 12 Monkeys. <br/><br/>So really then, an incredibly well made, well acted, confusing story told quite simply. Add to this several references to classic films and art and it is a beautiful film to boot.<br/><br/>If you get the chance and you've not seen it yet, please watch this film."

","I have a certain amount of respect for film-makers who venture to create a time-travel movie, simply because of the risk and complexity involved; it is no secret that many of these films are flops due in part to the uncertainties of the science, and the confusion they cause many viewers as the events unfold on-screen. As such, it is difficult to convey the paradox(es) established in these stories in a single Motion Picture as opposed to say, a novel. That being said, TWELVE MONKEYS works because it manages to overcome these flaws (for the most part) and provide viewers with a fresh, intelligent, and logical movie-going experience that is bound to stay with them for a while. My initial impression of TWELVE MONKEYS was that it appeared to be a combination of DONNIE DARKO and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, with a hint of the deep-lying anti-societal messages (and the Brad Pitt) contained in FIGHT CLUB. I loved these movies, and needless to say, I loved TWELVE MONKEYS.<br/><br/>The storyline is a very good one, spanning as many as four different time zones in order to tell the story. This is simply a wonderful science-fiction movie, with an underlying dark, brooding psychological thriller aspect, reminiscent of course, of DONNIE DARKO (though the latter was released six years after the former; it's just that I SAW DONNIE DARKO first).<br/><br/>The direction by MONTY PYTHON's Terry Gilliam is superb, as are the cinematography and set design, with one of the opening shots of Philadelphia's City Hall overrun by animals setting the dark mood for the rest of the film. The acting by Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe is sufficient, but Brad Pitt was the stand-out for me, though his portrayal was admittedly over-the-top. It's just that every time the movie shifted from his character, there was an appreciable drop in energy. I guess even the Academy thought likewise, enough so that they saw it fit to nominate him for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>TWELVE MONKEYS is a unique, intelligent, logical, and edgy Motion Picture that will challenge viewers and keep them involved throughout. The main character in the movie doesn't set about to change time (as is the case in most of these sci-fi time-travel movies) thereby creating another paradox; instead he sets about to study the events of the past in an effort to better the future. The screenwriters, David and Janet Peoples, set the movie in such a way that the viewer gets to decide what happens/happened, and as such TWELVE MONKEYS has sparked numerous intellectual debates, and will continue to do so for some time.<br/><br/>9/10. 3.5. stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 150 at #123. Highly recommended."

","This film remains one of my all time favourite's, and every time I see it I find something new that adds to the meaning of the story. I was surprised that Terry Gilliam, the man responsible for all of Monty Pythons crazy animations, directed the film, which was brilliantly written. It is a masterpiece that requires serious concentration and more than one viewing to make sense of it all. Brad Pitt's character is brilliantly acted and shows his ability as an actor in a role far from the Hollywood hunk style roles he is used to. The fact that time shifts without warning back and forward throughout the film makes events sometimes unexpected, but I prefer this type of film to the simple A to B type predictable films that Hollywood pumps out. I could watch Twelve Monkeys over and over without ever getting bored of it and highly recommend it to others."

The writer has performed a brilliant yet odd story in many different ways. twelve monkeys is very different to all the other big Hollywood film, it is a lot more clever and mystifies, it's something that must be watched with such delicacy and you must listen in to every word.<br/><br/>An unknown lethal virus has wiped out 99% of the populations in 1996, the 1% of the population is hanging on just by a thread, they manage to live to the year 2035, but must live underground. Eventually a convict volunteers to go back to the year 1996 to study how the killer virus occurred and to see if it could be stopped, it was apparent that it began from a mysterious army of twelve monkeys. It seems that everything will go well when the convict is mistakenly sent back to the year 1990, because of the dilemma the convict not knowing that it's the year 1990 and not the year 1996 is arrested and put in to a mental institution. In the mental institution he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist and Jeffrey Goins, the insane son of a scientist and virus expert.<br/><br/>The story is different yet it's with twists and turns to have your eyes glued to the screen and with flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past and more. <br/><br/>Now thinking of the performances Brad Pitt is the takes the cake acting as a complete insane loony which were brilliant that should have earned him an Oscar. Bruce Willis also has an outstanding shy performance (completely to die hard, it shows as that he can act many different ways).<br/><br/>twelve monkeys is a very well thought of film that is completely different to the average action/Sci-Fi routine.

Then let's make it over long - and as a final let us put in a really depressing ending that make the audience think twice about watching another movie. And... we all make a lot of money."" The problem is that the audience doesn't make any money - they pay for the spectacle. At least you could respect them enough to give them an intelligent movie with a final that makes sense.

","Does the story of Twelve Monkeys have some similarities in what is currently happening with the COVID-19 virus? The reason that people are up in arms with the implications of the pandemic is because the strain is strong and we don't want to wipe out our civilization with sickness and death. This is precisely the grim reality that this film depicts: A New York City where there are no humans roaming the metropolitan landscape. Only animals that escaped from the zoo can be seen.<br/><br/>My relationship with this movie has been misunderstood. I played Brad Pitt's character in a re-enactment at the Beverly Hills Playhouse in the intermediate class at the Los Feliz location. I felt that I could relate to the character due to my own personal bout with mental illness. Of course, my acting teacher wasn't on the same vibe and I got a terrible review with my acting portrayal.<br/><br/>I feel that this was Brad Pitt's best work because being able to play a character who is suffering from schizophrenia and is loaded up on a cocktail of medication in a psychiatric ward is very challenging and required an awful lot of research. I watched some supplemental behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film and Brad Pitt really did his homework in order to bring the character to life.<br/><br/>As for Bruce Willis, he is the star and main character of the film and deserves some plaudits too. I find the subject of time travel to be a fascinating one as well.

He starts complicating his story before it's even established, and embroiders and embroiders; hoping he can escape his basic shallowness. (""It has to be important! It's elaborate!"") He gets very serious before the audience is on board. Loudness, chaos, eye-popping sets, and cinematography, big acting...? It's all there. But thirty years into his career, those are still no substitute for a decent script, or depth of ideas. The self-important tone here suggests Gilliam believes the thoughtless raves he gets with each movie. In the end his bloated, overcooked stories always reveal his major goal is to throw 2o mawkish, Mannerist moments up on the screen. <br/><br/>12 Monkeys is just empty calories for your eyes.

"hall895","5","8","14","12 October 2015"," Intriguing story, lackluster execution
","In 2027 James Cole is a prisoner living beneath the streets of Philadelphia with some of the very few survivors of a virus which wiped out most of humankind back in 1996. Somehow these people living under the streets have invented time travel. OK then. The scientists in charge send Cole back to 1996 to collect information on the virus in order to develop a cure. Why, if you have time travel capabilities, the focus is on finding a cure for the few people alive in 2027 rather than stopping the virus from wiping out the species in the first place is not particularly clear. Anyhow Cole's mission gets off to a bad start when he ends up in 1990 rather than 1996 and immediately finds himself placed in a mental institution. This is all very weird. It's about to get much weirder.<br/><br/>Cole ends up jumping back and forth in time, quite befuddled by the whole experience. Anyone watching this film will also feel that sense of befuddlement. It's certainly an intriguing story but one which director Terry Gilliam never really got a firm grasp on. The film ends up being a bit of a disjointed mess. You're drawn into the story but ultimately end up lost in this movie's complex maze. Bruce Willis turns in a solid performance as Cole. He's solid and reliable, giving this film which threatens to veer out of control some desperately needed grounding. Brad Pitt is the other big star. He plays Jeffrey Goines who is one of the craziest crazies in the institution. Pitt plays the part with wild-eyed manic enthusiasm. The effect is quite jarring. Yes, Jeffrey is supposed to be crazy but this is some serious overacting on Pitt's part. Madeleine Stowe plays the female lead, Kathryn Railly, Cole's doctor at the institution. Cole pops in and out of her life. Initially she thinks he's nuts but as she processes new information she may have to re-evaluate that position. Unfortunately the chemistry between Willis and Stowe is lacking, the relationship between their characters falls rather flat. And as their relationship becomes more important in the story that becomes a big problem for the movie.<br/><br/>Ultimately 12 Monkeys is a rather frustrating film. It has an intriguing premise but the story does not play itself out in a very satisfying way. Things get muddled pretty quickly and the story twists itself into some confusing knots. The film tries to spring some surprises but telegraphs some of its twists way too soon, which is part of the reason the ending is not nearly as powerful as Gilliam would hope. Meanwhile Gilliam's assortment of visual tricks throughout serve no purpose other than to distract and annoy. Stowe's performance lacks energy, Pitt's has too much energy. Christopher Plummer is underused. Willis does a fine job but too much of what surrounds him disappoints. For all the jumping back and forth in time the film is rather slowly paced. The story may interest you but there really is not much in the way of entertainment. You would imagine a story such as this would be full of exciting moments but excitement is in very short supply. 12 Monkeys held great promise but in the end that promise is not fulfilled."
"Quinoa1984","10","6","10","29 April 2000"," Confusing, but after a while it comes together, extremely well
","When I first saw Twelve Monkeys, I felt like saying ""WHAT?! I was also twelve years old (odd coincidence), and I was so wrapped up into the atmosphere of the picture, this very worn-in future and grungy, underground style of science fiction. Years later, after having seen the film several times more, it sinks in a bit clearer, though the mystery around it, a sort of questioning that is posed more for the viewer to figure things out, stays around. It's one of the truly challenging works of not-entirely-classifiable science fiction films to come out of the 'mainstream' Hollywood in many years. It deals with madness, time, and how we chose to have our destinies stay the same or change or do anything to find out about ourselves, and it's done in such an entertaining fashion that it's got layers to it. It is a tale of a man (Bruce Willis) who is sent from 2029 to 1996 to stop the end of the world, which will take place very soon (a possible plausible thing considering the amount of possible ways to destroy the world through chemicals, especially towards the end of the 20th century).<br/><br/>But, it doesn't start off there; first we get a series of scenes set in a mental hospital in 1990, with Brad Pitt's character as the deranged wildcat in the hospital. There's even a love story- in a manner of speaking- that unfolds between Willis and Madeline Stowe's character that is so unconventional that it is hard to find where the tension stops and where the real compassion begins. What ensues is strange yet intriguing; we're sure up to a point of where this might lead, but the final revelation still ranks among Gilliam's best. Disturbing and yet some great entertainment that doesn't sit like a lump for its audience to chew. The sparks and gears have to work in your head during this one, as layers get stripped and you have to piece it back together once it's done. But it's done in such a way that is totally apart from pretension. For art-film viewers the sight of Willis and Pitt might be a bit jarring, and likewise for the mainstream action-adventure crowd the amount of intense and odd camera moves will seem one-of-a-kind. For me, it's one of the best films of 1995, even the 90s."

","Onetime cartoonist Terry Gillian has a vivid Gothic imagination, but also a long track record of proving that this alone is not enough to define a good film-maker. Unfortunately for Gilliam, his films are not just bad, but unusual and bad as well, and so while many bad film-makers have made fortunes, Gilliam has repeatedly lost Hollywood millions. 'Twelve Monkeys', a science-fiction thriller starring human ape Bruce Willis, isn't quite as bad as it initially promises to be, but features characteristically wacky editing and a self-consciously confused plot, as well as what must be Brad Pitt's most annoying role ever. Its visual richness can't hide the simple truth that it's insufficiently funny or clever; and what's sad is that the same can be said of most of Gilliam's other movies. As a set designer, he gets top marks. But as a director, he makes a pretty good cartoonist."

","I expected to find myself disappointed in TWELVE MONKEYS. I was not. I loved it. It's probably Terry Gilliam's best film, but then again every time I see a Terry Gilliam movie I always find myself saying this. (Except for BRAZIL, which I must confess I did not like.) TWELVE MONKEYS is, I suppose, a time travel movie; but when I was watching it I never considered it to be one. It's so bizarre and multi-layered and multi-genre that I didn't have time to stop and label it as one specific kind of movie. It's a drama, it's a horror, it's a thriller, it's a comedy, it's a satire, etc. It has everything.<br/><br/>I would be willing to recommend it on the superb acting alone - Willis gives one of his best (perhaps even THE best) performances of his career, and Brad Pitt is similarly at the top of his game. (His nervous and verbal ticks are classic stuff.) Gilliam keeps this going from beginning to end, never losing momentum. It's interesting from the first shot to the last, and I think TWELVE MONKEYS contains far more depth than many of Gilliam's other films. This is the ""epic"" of Gilliam's career. Because of this fact, some of his die-hard fans will claim it's not any good, because it's not the typical Gilliam style. It's a bit more dramatic, perhaps, than his other films (particularly the ending).<br/><br/>But Gilliam's vision is still clear in every frame (with the awkward camera angles, blue tints, crazy outfits and styles and surroundings). I love this movie."

","I tend to hate big Hollywood movies cause they are garbage, and this one was a perfect example...I honestly had no idea it would be in IMDb's top 250.<br/><br/>Willis plays a man in an underground post apocalyptic future and hes sent back in the past to try to find out information about the group of people responsible. He goes back and ends up in the wrong place, or perhaps wrong time. Then a bunch of crap happens and I paid attention but was so bored I didn't really care.<br/><br/>I was making mental notes as I watched to kill boredom. I was thinking it had some great set designs. I was thinking that Bruce Willis had no hair, but yet he looked older than usual. I was thinking the acting was great and Brad Pitt actually did a great job for a change, he's usually so boring. I also was thinking the music was not at all fitting.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam has directed a few movies I like and he did a good job here with 12 monkeys, not a great job just a good one. Not his best work as a director, and its sad cause he could've done so much to add character to this dull film.<br/><br/>I like many sci-fi films, but this one was a bit too crazy for me, We knew the future, he claimed it couldn't be changed, yet he seemed to fight to save it. It has all kinds of tie-ins from the future and the past and they try to make it seem surprising, but its kind of like they are treating the viewers like idiots. I mean we all get where the film is going from the first 10 minutes....<br/><br/>Such a let down, I was not thrilled, I was not shocked, I was not excited...I was bored...really damn bored!"

"monkeysgalore","10","3","4","5 April 2020"," Science Fiction Masterclass
","A masterwork of science fiction, 12 Monkeys deserves all of the credit it's achieved over the years. With top-notch performances all around, a smart and twisty script, and atmospheric, almost cartoonish-ly effective directing from Terry Gilliam, this movie is quite an experience.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Madeline Stowe are in fine form here, with Willis as charismatic as ever. He has the same determination as his other protagonists, but gone are the witty one-liners and caustic asides. Brad Pitt is throughly psychotic and gives a very OTT performance, which actually really works.<br/><br/>Like most high concept sci-fi movies, 12 Monkeys establishes a dark and depressing tone with a bleak future, while attempting to deal with some bigger issues. I think the film's ultimate message is to enjoy life and not get so caught up in one goal that you don't stop to enjoy anything. This is most clear when Willis' character is in the car and he leans out the window and smiles with the wind on his face while listening to music. This is a pivotal scene, and arguably the most important moment in the movie.<br/><br/>The approach to time travel that the film takes is also more interesting, which is that the future can not be changed. The mechanics of this are interesting, as is how the characters try to deal with it. It gets pretty complicated and mind bending after a while.<br/><br/>This movie has crazy cinematography, several cool fight scenes, Brad Pitt being crazy, and Bruce Willis eating a spider. It's completely crazy.<br/><br/>Definitely check this masterpiece out. Culture yourself."
"davidmvining","10","3","4","23 March 2020"," One of Gilliam's finest works
","Watching all of a film director's movies in a row provides a certain clarity around theme, especially regarding a director like Terry Gilliam who's movies always revolve around very similar themes, mostly dealing with the intersection of fantasy and reality. It's evolved from the hopeless disconnect of perpetual optimism of Denis in Jabberwocky to the fantastical escapes by Kevin, Sam, and the Baron in Time Bandits, Brazil, and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen to the broaching of mental illness and grief for both Parry and Jack in The Fisher King. Twelve Monkeys uses the ideas of time travel and mental illness to ask a lot of the similar questions Gilliam had been asking for over a decade. Namely, he was asking about where the line between fantasy and reality should be, whether we should cast off imaginative thought in our day to day lives.<br/><br/>The movie is intentionally muddy about what is real and what is not, giving equal cinematic treatment to things in the past and the present (or present and the future, from the audience's point of view). Gilliam loves his Dutch angles and the exaggerated focus inherent in wide angle lenses in closeup on a characters' face, and it's always meant to imply a skewed reality. In that way, he films both everything in the future and everything in the psych wards using the same methods, saving the more traditional straight on framing for smaller scenes where Cole, the main character, feels some sense of calm, like when he's driving with his psychologist and listening to music. This sense of disorientation lends itself to the central path that Cole follows where he questions the nature of his reality.<br/><br/>So, the reality that he starts in is a future where humanity has all been wiped out from a virus, relegated to a meager existence underground ruled by a scientist collective that's solely occupied with finding a cure. They have developed time travel technology and send back undesirables to gather information about the origin of the pandemic. The science is imprecise, so people get thrown about into all sorts of times like the middle ages, World War I, and 1990 when the target is 1996, a few months before the start of the outbreak in 1997. They know that the epidemic started in Philadelphia and focus on a terrorist faction called the Twelve Monkeys that plastered the city with graffiti about how they ""did it"".<br/><br/>Cole first gets sent to 1990 where he's immediately picked up and placed in a mental institution. He's an unstable person to begin with, but time travel and his talk about the present being the past just tells the authorities that he's a loony and deserves to be there. Again, this section of the film is filmed in the same exaggerated style as the stuff from the future, implying that we should treat both of them with same level of fantastical skepticism. And therein lies the literal mystery of the story: Is the future we see a construct of Cole's mind or is the past he's trapped in equally real?<br/><br/>There's a small moment that I think helps illuminate this. When Cole first appears in the mental hospital, he's cornered by a man, dressed in a suit, who talks about mental divergence and how he's actually on another planet at the same time getting ready to quell the barbarian hordes on Pluto. He provides this literal possibility for Cole's condition, and then we never see him again. Perhaps this man in the suit wasn't mentally divergent, but actually was in two places at once.<br/><br/>As with any Gilliam film, that literal question isn't the point. Also, with any Gilliam film, the madman ends up being right. At the center of Cole's struggles with his grasp on reality is Dr. Kathryn Railly, his psychiatrist. She comes into the film as dead certain of her ""religion"", as she calls it, of psychiatry's grasp on the real vs. the unreal. However, as Cole keeps disappearing and re-appearing, even appearing in a photo from World War I, her faith in the certainty of her convictions gets shaken.<br/><br/>The framing device of the whole movie implies the cyclical nature of Cole's existence. He has dreams of a memory from his childhood, from before the outbreak, where he's in an airport and witnesses a shooting. As the movie moves along and he becomes familiar with more principles in the 90s, we start seeing more of their faces in the recurring dream. This is most evidence when we see Jeffrey Goines, a fellow mental patient and the leader of the Twelve Monkeys, in his vision only after Cole meets him. I think this raises some practical questions about the ability to change time as well as Cole's grasp on reality, but again, they're not really the point. The point is that this dream, this fantasy, grounds him and provides him direction, giving him purpose in the face of all the questions that assault him.<br/><br/>There's a wonderful twistiness to the film that's more than just being clever. The movie is certainly that, but at the heart of it is Cole's journey. He's so wracked by doubt about the basic fabric of reality around him, played wonderfully by Bruce Willis, while Kathryn Railly tries to use her view of the world to make sense of it all. The score is oddly French, probably a nod to La Jetee, the French short film that inspired the movie. Brad Pitt is a maniac as Goines. It's Gilliam's most polished looking film while also maintaining his very particular flair. It's a very good movie, produced well, and with a surprisingly smooth production history, that stands as one of Gilliam's finest works."

Know he must escape the hospital and continue his mission.<br/><br/>With a brilliant script, a unique vision and a superb cast, 12 monkeys makes it mark in cinema history as one of the best time travel movies to grace the screen. 12 Monkeys is a film that will take multiple viewings to comprehend, and even then there is still new aspects of the film that appear to you with every viewing. Everything in this film clicks together so well, making it one of the best films of the 90's.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam is a director that looks at the world at an angle, he brings this angle to his films. One only has to view his previous films, such as Brazil to see how far off the edge this guy is. With 12 Monkeys he brings us a film that is off the chart is bizarre weirdness, but is able to make the film make sense in the end. Which is hard for any time travel flick. Unlike other films that deal with time travel, 12 monkeys makes the entire act of time travel seem believable. Gilliam has an impressive track record and 12 monkeys is near the top of it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt stands out in this film as the totally insane patient that befriends Willis. What did Gilliam do to make Pitt so nuts in this film? Simply take away his cigarettes. Maybe Pitt should stop smoking all together and his other films will be as good as this one. Pitt gives this dark and morose film a funny bone. Willis, who normally is mediocre in his films shines here. Along with Stowe, this cast brings a whole new level to the film.<br/><br/>The film itself is off the wall and ahead of it's time. It's dark and brilliant. The only fault would be that in some scenes it drags a bit. 12 Monkeys is a film that will still be talked about in years to come. It is definitely one of the best films for everyone involved. It's madness starts from the first shot right up until the last second, it never lets it's out of place style end. Which is what makes this film so good."

Terry Gilliam really is a genius! and you will find yourself rooting for Willis while thinking he's incredibly bizarre at the same time, plus I loved how it let the audiences think for themselves. It is very confusing at times, and it has some very violent scenes as well, plus I loved the scene with Willis and Stowe near the end at the Movie Theatre!.

Brad Pitt is also incredible here, I'm not a huge fan of his but I absolutely loved him here, he was extremely hilarious, and wonderfully way OTT, but somehow he managed to keep it interesting and not over do it, I loved his character, and think he deserved his Oscar nomination!. Madeleine Stowe is incredibly gorgeous and is amazing here, she had brilliant chemistry with Willis, was incredibly sexy, was extremely likable, and was totally convincing overall, she is able to play any role! (Stowe Rules!!!!!!!). Christopher Plummer is OK as Pitt's father but didn't have much to do and was somewhat wasted.

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","4","6","29 January 2007"," History evades human control
","This is a remake of the French film « La Jetée », and yet it is completely different. The film kept the time-travelling dimension, the catastrophe that killed five billions human beings and forced the survivors to live underground in some kind of medically managed prison for everyone. The time-traveller is a volunteer in this prison who is trying to reduce his time by volunteering to the surface to pick insects and samples of life out there, and also to the past to find out what happened in 1996, and eventually prevent the catastrophe. But that is about all, except for the boy at the airport and the man killed there with the same twitch in the punchline as in « La Jetée ». But the film develops three other dimensions. The first one is the reaction of the world of the past when confronted to this time-traveller from their future. They just put him away in some asylum where he meets the woman of his dream as one of the doctors there. This reaction reveals the strange blindness of humanity because they consider anyone who is in anyway different, divergent as one says, as being insane. In this world you have to conform to the little box where fate, in fact social determination, has put you. You can be normal, or you can be a deranged preacher, or you can be a whore or pimp, or you can be a homeless bum, or you can be a criminal, but beyond there you are insane. That makes society absolutely blind to anything that is slightly off the line because they refuse to see it. This is perfectly exemplified with this army of the 12 monkeys, a clandestine criminal organization that has stolen some dangerous bacterial germ and is going to spread it in half a dozen cities in the world. The film also develops the relation between the time-traveller and the lady of his dream. It is a real relation. Medical at first, then it is an abduction, then it becomes some kind of love or cooperation. The lady then is no longer dead like in the French model. She sure is alive and she ends up believing him about what was or is supposed to happen on December 13th. But they fail or rather fate, history, destiny succeed. He dies and she runs after him and the criminal with his bacteriological samples can escape. The world is doomed. This is the third development of the French model. You cannot change history. This already was in H.G. Wells's « The Time Machine ». But this time it is central in the film. At the same time he plays on two embodiments of the same character in the same scene but duplicated by one who is time-travelling. This is an essential element of the trilogy « Back to the Future ». But you cannot change history that follows its own rules and cannot be tampered with. What is to happen has to happen. Total fatality. Strangely enough it does not have the same meaning as in H.G. Wells. No sentimentality about it. Just the brutal realization that humanity has vainly thought and believed they could make history. This new idea was common in H.G. Wells's time. Today it has become some oddity from our marxist positivistic past, some oddity that very few people believe in any more. History is going its own way along its own rails with its own reasons and any human being in this history has to follow the flow. They can swim or they can let themselves be carried by the current, or they can sink in a way or another. But they will not stop the stream nor change its course. A river has never been able to go up the hills : it has to follow rules that have little to do with us, such as gravity and slope.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

Before i go further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins( Brad Pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe) who eventually teams up with Bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually Brad Pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away."

It amazes me that so many people can watch something like this and think it is a masterpiece. I like some time travel movies, and absolutely loved ""The Butterfly Effect"" (director's cut). It seems all you have to do is have a big budget for effects and a couple of big stars like Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, and if it's a complicated sci-fi story, fans of the genre will fall all over themselves to praise the result. This one was laughably bad, and the two leads had no chemistry whatsoever. I thought ""Inception"" was over-complicated and overrated, but compared to this it was superb.

","I love weird sci-fi movies. I love plot lines that make no sense, and scenes that take insane amounts of imagination to even comprehend. Unfortunately, being someone born and raised on Twilight Zone episodes and old 50's and 60's sci-fi movies, I think I've seen every sci-fi plot that has ever been used. Maybe that's why I found 12 Monkeys just downright predictable in every way. And I'm sure if you're like me, and you've seen most of what the genre has to offer, this isn't going to thrill you or make you think any more than a children's cartoon with a space ship episode.<br/><br/>Good: <br/><br/><ul><li>12 Monkeys had quality. It took it's time to make everything it did and said believable to watch. That is something that is missing in a lot of newer sci-fi movies, and it's refreshing to see it here.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some neat images. Nothing groundbreaking or genre-defining, but there is a lot of sci-fi imagery that is pretty cool to see on film.</li></ul><br/><br/>Bad: <br/><br/><ul><li>The acting isn't completely horrid, but it's so over-the-top and sometimes and sometimes downright cliché that I couldn't help but smirk at most of it. Bruce Wills acts like a complete retard in some scenes, and a macho action hero in others. Brad Pit is ridicules.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cheese. I'm sorry, but the camera angles are pure and utter cheese. I assume it's meant to be childish purposely, but with a movie like this, it just takes away the ability to even care about anything. Likewise, the music is horrible. I can understand the monkey theme song, fine. But was it really necessary to have cartoony classical music to boot it? Come on now. Also, there is an unnecessary amount of male rear nudity that, once again, takes away any seriousness. You put a guy's butt in a serious movie and it's always a way for the audience to ask: ""Wait, is this American Pie?"" </li></ul><br/><br/>Typical: <br/><br/><ul><li>The story has been used so many times in so many different movies/books, what was the point? I guess this is the first time the screwed-up-time-travel plot hit the mainstream big-screen, but it has been used in so much more things before it, it's almost like a slap in the face when you get to the heavily clichéd and predictable ending. There are a few points of semi-originality scattered throughout, but what makes the difference? Go watch two random episodes of The Twilight Zone (from the 60's, might I add) and I can guarantee one will make you think: ""Hey, wasn't that also the plot from 12 Monkeys?"" I don't know how anyone can find this confusing; it's just run-of-the-mill. Average at best.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The romance spin was so cliché I found myself wondering if it's even possible to have an American movie without a romantic subplot. Ben Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation says it best: ""What if in some parallel universe every movie had to have a subplot where people square danced? That would be absurd, right? It's no different than EVERY last American movie having a random romantic subplot. It's absurd and pointless."" </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The slow pace builds quality, as I said, but that's also a major problem: 12 Monkeys is slow. I fell asleep during the middle and had to finish it the next day. The majority of the movie is boring talking scene that say things you figured out from the first trailer.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall: Really, was it necessary to make this movie? Sure, it had some quality and maybe it was a little out of the ordinary back in 1995, but those are the only two reasons 12 Monkeys didn't get a 1/10 from me.<br/><br/>If you consider yourself a true sci-fi fan, there is no reason to watch this.

","Like most of Terry Gilliam's works, this has the air of a great film not quite being made. His baroque vision of the future is wonderful. Civilisation underground after the plague is a hellish dystopia saturated by the same incompetent control-freakery he portrayed in Brazil. Some of the images are spectacular, particularly the wild animals running loose in an American city. Gilliam's narrative playfulness, throwing Bruce Willis back and forth through time before the story really starts, almost rescues the plot from clichés. Not entirely though. This was designed as a blockbuster thriller and is only original by those dreadful standards. But the chief problem is the cast. Willis, while being less annoying than normal, is a monosyllabic grunter. Madeline Stowe only really does a job as the usual beautiful scientist-cum-love interest Meanwhile Brad Pitt is allowed to give us the full scope of his non-existent talents. An evil genius hammy even by Gary Oldman standards, he is virtually unwatchable."
"tedg","Null","6","12","29 May 2002"," Brass Monkey
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam disappoints. He makes a competent film. He often folds narrative through time as he does here. He uses architecture as a central element in his shots. He is bold with camera perspectives. He creates alternative and strange worlds. He often deals with class actors who do their best work for him. He tweaks the scifi genre in sort places. All of that is true here. All of that is stuff I like.<br/><br/>But this film has no coherence. It is not enough to have a clever space and a clever camera angle if the aren't coordinated to create some effect. It is not enough to have Brad wonderfully careening if your eye isn't in the right space. There's just so much good stuff here all jumbled about. Little is controlled or exploited.<br/><br/>I contrast this with `Fear and Loathing' which had several advantages:<br/><br/>--Gilliam knew he screwed up on this one and was smart enough to know what to fix<br/><br/>--He was able to write his own script. This one has two many literary devices to comfortably be shoehorned into a novel cinematic framework.<br/><br/>--He had Depp, who understands how to act in a way that defines the space the eye only imagines. Depp's character was hallucinating and the hallucinations mapped well to Gilliam's sense of an alternative universe.<br/><br/>Not here. Willis and Pitt work really well together, each at the end of explored personal territory, but it isn't the same territory Gilliam shows us. Hitchcock -- who is relied on here -- affirms reality instead of redefining it.<br/><br/>Usually I can find some clever self-referential irony in this: a story about dissonant perception told in a manner that is perceptually dissonant. But it seems too competent a notion to put on this project. Things are different with `Loathing.' Better.<br/><br/>One think: I kept looking for someone to say ""minkee"" after Peter Sellers' famous, Python-inspiring bit in ""Return of the Pink Panther."""
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","7","15 December 2015"," Stop monkeying around and go see 12 Monkeys. This movie is insanely good.
","It's time to revisit this 1995 neo-noir science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam. After all, this film has recently made history once again, when Syfy Channel has chosen to adapted it, into a television show in early 2015. With that said, I have to say, unlike the show, which is a remake of the film; the original movie '12 Monkeys' is more of a reimagining, than a remake of the 1962 French short film, 'La Jetée', written by Chris Marker. While, it's true, that La Jetée and 12 Monkeys have some similarities; such in the case, of the main character, which both has a man redreaming of a childhood tragedy and time travelling to stop it. Still, these films couldn't easily be compared with each other. Marker's La Jetee is about a man trying to escape the aftermath of World War III in post-apocalyptic world, by travelling in the past to find his love; while 12 Monkeys is about, a man, James Cole (Bruce Willis) sent to the past, gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet. Although, La Jetee inject their story with an intimate humanistic quality, juxtaposing romance with an eerie atmosphere of impending disaster. The big different is that 12 Monkeys screenplay written by David and Janet Peoples is much more grandeur with its theme; interlocking dramatic social commentary about the world's environment, the struggles of mental help, and how people view religion. Could psychiatry be seem as a new religion!? Is Faith is a delusion!? Does the march of time, prove that what we deem insane, today; might seem normal, tomorrow? These are the brilliant questions that this movie brings to us. While, yes, this film does perversion the original intent of Marker's film message, but, Gilliam's version gives more to the table then the 1962 nuclear holocaust drama. It's reasons like these, why it feels like Gilliam's version is more like its own standalone masterpiece of contemporary cinema, rather than a remake. Plus the special combination of directorial vision, superb writing, and mood enhancing cinematography delivered an engaging piece of dramatic fiction. One thing, that this Terry Gilliam's film has, over that French short film is a superb cast. Bruce Willis delivers one of his most nuanced performances as Cole, creating a strong yet vulnerable man who must overcome his own fears of madness in order to save humanity. Brad Pitts plays against his pretty boy typecast, here, as the crazy, and paranoid schizophrenic, Jeffrey Goines. Meanwhile, Madeleine Stowe gives alright performance as Dr. Kathryn Reilly, who must call into question all of her long held beliefs, and face the insanity of the world around her. I like her lectures on abnormal psychology and the theoretical ""Cassandra complex"". It was somewhat brilliance, nevertheless, her falling in love scenes with Cole need some work. It wasn't convincing. Another great thing from the film is the music by Paul Buckmaster. It's so eerily with its creepy circus like theme. However, I do have to say, the movie does have some faults in the eyes of some critics. As with most Terry Gilliam films, this film is often dense in grim darkness to the point, that certain people find them, somewhat depressing to watch. The whole bittersweet ending is a bit hard to take for some. Another problem is all the film references and shout outs such as 1958's Vertigo, 1931's Monkey Business, Blade Runner & 1985's Brazil. It comes across as a cheesy homage. Terry Gilliam's 'Monty Python"" cartoony style of realism mixed with sci-fi fantasy is a bit jarring. In my eyes, the pacing is a problem as well. I didn't like the repetitive annoying nature of the childhood flashback dream sequences. It was a bit overwhelming. I also didn't really buy, those dream-like scenes, Gilliam has, as a great example of human thought. La Jetee, somewhat address this matter, better with its slide-show, motionless black & white style. It seem more like a dream in the unconscious mind than Gilliam's version. The still moving images works best when exploring dream, memory and the concept of time with its simplicity. However, as a grand motion picture film, 12 Monkeys is superior in that field. La Jetee can barely be count as a film. Another problem in the film is the complex story. It seem to be missing a lot of things to make it, perfect. There are a lot of unexplained sequences in the film such like the 'Bob"" scene that really doesn't add up, logically. The whole 'butterfly effect' is also a bit confusing, when you take in 'You Can't Fight Fate' aspect. So, why, then, do the future scientists give Cole a gun to change history? Did Cole alter history or not? Also, what was 'the insurance' lady, talking about? We might never know. Some viewers found these unanswered questions to be a bit muddled. Despite that, I do like Terry Gilliam's brilliance. The fact that he doesn't dictate his story to the viewers; rather he allows them to discover its subtleties and secrets on their own, and then draw their own conclusions is good. It makes the film even more interesting to watch with a group of friends and everyone's perception of the ending is contrary. It's this idea of open interpretation that makes 12 Monkeys so timeless. Overall: It's worth watching and worth discussing about. A must-watch."

","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is not your average film. There are a lot of hidden things you won't see at first glance. To really appreciate it, you have to see it at least twice, but preferably more. The story revolves mainly around Willis, who claims to come from a future where a terrible virus has whiped out almost all of mankind. Animals once again rule the face of the Earth, while what remains of humanity lives benath the surface. The outbreak of this virus coincides with the rise of the ""Army of the Twelve Monkeys"", an animal rights movement, and they are being held responsible. So Willis, a convicted criminal, travels back to the 1990's, to track them down, and save the future.<br/><br/>This may seem pretty straightforward, but looks can be deceiving. As the film progresses, and things become clearer, Twelve Monkeys turns into a weird trip, where nothing is as it seems, and noone can be trusted. The main characters all deliver powerful performances, with Brad Pitt, as Jeffrey Goines, as possibly the films' funniest, weirdest, and most confusing character. It wasn't until the second or third time I saw this film, that I completely understood the story, and the events that took place. So if by chance, you don't figure it out the first time, take my advice, and watch it again, and again, and again, until it all becomes clear. Because one of the great strengths of this film is that however brillant the storyline may be, it's impossible to explain it to anyone."

","Twelve Monkeys is a time travel fan's dream come true.  It is highly complex, well acted and is incredibly logical.  Of course, it's also quite confusing and takes a while to get into. You'll probably get little of what's going on the first time, which is likely to turn a lot of people off. However, this is the sort of movie that you can watch five times and still wonder what will happen next, simply because in your quest to understand exactly what is going on you missed a scene.  This doesn't mean that it makes no sense, rather it just gives the audience a lot of subtle information that's hard to pick up.  It's also very spooky and effective, and will probably give you the creeps after each viewing.<br/><br/>In short, if you're up for a heavy, convoluted but overall quite satisfying experience, give Twelve Monkeys a try.  Go into it with the proper attitude (and don't watch it with someone who's seen it - they'll just feel the need to explain it to you) and you should come out a devoted fan."

","In the year 2035, surviving members of the human race have been driven underground by the spread of a deadly virus that was released by a madman back in 1996. These people have managed to create a livable environment under the surface and are so advanced in intelligence that they have even mastered the time continuum. now it's time to send someone back to 1996 to try to undo the harm that was done then so they can reclaim the planet from the animals and insects, who apparently were unaffected by the disease. Who do these brilliant folks pick for this all-important mission? This being a Hollywood movie, the choice falls upon an inarticulate sociopath who can barely string two sentences together. Great choice, guys...and the movie goes downhill from then on as Bruce Willis rambles on to anyone who'll listen about his mission, as if he expects to be believed and can't understand why these idiots don't believe that he's a time-traveler on a mission to save them. He also acts like he's heavily into barbiturates. In a supporting role as the hyped-up wacko who ends up helping to destroy the human race, Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe Award which, in this case, tells more about the Golden Globe Awards than it does about Brad Pitt, whose performance resembles a high school kid's idea of an insane person.

Mr B.Pitt shows off a bit as the maladjusted son of the corporate Bad Guy (Mr C.Plummer who,for some reason,choses to play him with a terrible Southern accent).Miss M.Stowe plays the only other serious part in the film,a psychiatrist entrusted with the care of both Mr Willis and Mr Pitt - surely a job too big for any one human being.The rest of the cast are comic book figures.She does a nice line in confused disbelief,an attitude I imagine she shared with a fair percentage of the audience.<br/><br/>But the point in ""The Twelve Monkeys"" is not in the acting,the writing or the plot.It is a signature piece for the wildly iconoclastic Mr. Gilliam,and it is entirely his creature.

Is it an action movie about Bruce Willis dealing with the inevitablility of (ahem) Armageddon? Yes to all! The film even takes a jab at ITSELF when the lead character watches a film he saw as a kid & comments that the movie's the same, but HE's changed, so it's all different.

"Leofwine_draca","6","4","8","23 November 2016"," Complex, one of a kind story is only fitfully entertaining
","Terry Gilliam, the man responsible for the many wacky cartoons in Monty Python's Flying Circus, directed this film which turns out to be clever, haunting, and also extremely confusing. The plot twists and turns every ten seconds, and is set in half a dozen time periods, so you need to keep all your wits about you to work out what exactly is going on. Strangely enough though, in some instances the film seems to completely lose the plot and meanders along for quarter of an hour or so before kicking back into gear, so that it's about half an hour too long in the end.<br/><br/>These minor quibbles aside however, TWELVE MONKEYS is a refreshingly intelligent slice of science fiction. As I've mentioned before, time travel films always appeal to me because of the paradox aspect, and I've always been hooked on themes such as these. Bruce Willis turns in one of his more interesting performances as the anguished, belaboured time traveller, who spends most of the film either being beaten up or humiliated, yet finds his own humanity at the end of the film. He is given solid support by Stowe, Plummer and Brad Pitt, who comes across well as a twitching lunatic.<br/><br/>It's difficult to review a film like this because of the complexity, but everything on the production side comes across glossily, while the music and atmosphere puts it into the same class as art house fare like THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN; there's a definite French flavour to it. TWELVE MONKEYS is clever stuff, but also liable to give you a headache if you don't watch out, and in that respect it can be frustrating. However it does have a quality ending which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen it. Good acting and good direction, let down only by occasional moments of silliness, make this film interesting viewing for those in the right frame of mind."
"eagle_owl","8","4","8","28 February 2005"," Shows far more originality than 99% of films.
","Bruce Willis plays James Cole, a man from a future where the world has been devastated by a deadly virus, who is chosen to go back in time and try to find out how this came about.<br/><br/>Directed by Terry Gilliam, Twelve Monkeys bears many similarities with his earlier film Brazil, but somehow feels more complete. Brazil was a weird, and at times brilliant futuristic parable, with crazy characters offset against grim cityscapes. However it failed to mesh into a coherent whole, and had a plot that amounted to little more than a dash from one mad sketch to another.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys largely succeeds in improving on the things that didn't work in Brazil. Gilliam has reined in some of his more bizarre ideas, and paid more attention to keeping the plot moving, making this a far more balanced work. Even so, Gilliam remains true to his own uniquely quirky style, making Twelve Monkeys strikingly different from the average science fiction film.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays a character far removed from his usual action movie stereotype. As a man set adrift in a strange world, he demonstrates that he can do more than just blow up buildings. Brad Pitt also gives a terrific performance as a mental patient, although it does become a tad irritating after a while.<br/><br/>Being a time travel film, there are many plot holes in Twelve Monkeys, but this is unavoidable in any film on this theme, since whatever approach is taken to the possibilities of time travel you are bound to create inconsistencies. For example, this film's notion is that the time in which Cole lives is the present, and everything up until this point has already happened, so it is impossible to change the past. However, surely every action that Cole takes in the past must impact on events in some small way, through the very fact of his presence.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is an ambitious and impressive film. Of course many of its ideas are derivative, but it shows far more originality than 99% of films. It succeeds in being simultaneously entertaining and thought provoking, and deserves to be regarded as one of the best science fiction films of the 90's."

","I like the bit with the monkeys. I didn't count them so I can't confirm if there are 12 or not"
"FlorianLaur","10","2","3","8 February 2020"," One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made
","12 monkeys has got to be one of the best movies about time travel ever made. It's witness to the height of movie making in the 90s that gave us such gems as this one, American Beauty, Se7en, Terminator 2 and L.A. Confidential (although not technically 90s). Movies still had a deeper story and didn't forcefeed the solution to the audience.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis gives his best performance, other than his great work on Moonlighting. The scene in the car with him and the radio is Oscar-worthy to me. Madeleine Stowe makes me wonder what ever happened to her, she was a great actress.<br/><br/>The key to understanding the movie is to understand that there are two approaches to time travel. Some say you can change the past. But the more realistic approach is that you can't, because whatever happened in the past has already led to the present.<br/><br/>In 12 monkeys, most of the movie takes place in the past, BUT the main storyline is in the present/future.<br/><br/>Cole is doomed from day one. He isn't sent back to stop the virus (that can't be done, or the present/future wouldn't exist to begin with. Merely by existing, it proves that the past can NEVER be changed). The characters in the movie even talk about this several times.
Cole is basically sent back to die. Why? Because he is caught in a strange time loop. We have the young Cole that will always see his older self (that shouldn't be there anyways) die at the airport. He will grow up to be the older Cole from the present. But he always will be sent back, because he has to die in the past (maybe that's why he is in prison too at the beginning of the film).<br/><br/>Cole tells the scientists that he won't come back. So he has to die. They achieve this by giving him the gun. This also assures that the virus will be released. It's a moebius loop. This has and will always happen in the past time line. This also explains why Kathryn feels she has seen Cole before.<br/><br/>The scientists basically use Cole only to get information. They need to travel back to the point before the virus mutated. When we see the scientist shaking hands with Peters, she is basically infecting herself with the virus, making sure the scientists have a sample of the original virus to work with, thus creating a cure in the present.<br/><br/>If you keep that in mind (that the present can't be changed), the movie isn't that hard to understand, except for the Cole paradox. I guess because the movie also progresses in the present/future, that's the reason why Cole will eventually seize to exist. He will just always grow up to the point where he is sent back in time to die, to grow up again to be sent back to die to grow up again etc.
Still, by doing that, he did help mankind to finally take the next step and gave them a future again. It's just sad that it'll be one where he never saw the ocean..."

","Who doesn't like atmospheric movies? Those that can drag you into their world and make you feel like a part of it? Atmosphere is that aspect of a movie which can make up for other ill made aspects. It's like a glue which makes entire movie experience coherent and credible.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is one of those movies. From beginning to the end it drags you every moment more and more into it's milieu. Sometimes it's a futuristic milieu and sometimes, rather most of the times, pretty ordinary 90's ambient. And still everything ordinary somehow tastes extraordinary. That's because we're following a story from Cole's (Willis) point of view. Going back to the past felt for him like being born in entirely different world. Clouds and air. People and the way they dressed and looked. Everything was different. And yet everything kinda looked so familiar. Like he had seen it before. This emotional element of somehow rediscovering this world as natural in contrast to unnatural and quaint underworld plays a pivotal role in engaging the viewer into Twelve Monkeys ambient.<br/><br/>What else makes a good sci-fi movie? I believe one of the most important aspects is seriousness. Not that seriousness without any kind of humor, but rather that one which takes future events and the way they correlate to us today seriously. Twelve Monkeys does it both ways. Past and future are being delivered to the viewer in a somewhat cataclysmic manner. You know how everything is going to eventually end, but still believe inevitable might somehow be side moved. I won't go into much detail of how good Willis, Pitt and Stowe are. But I'll tell you that both Pitt and Willis nailed very demanding roles. As one reviewer said it, Cole experiences serious time travel side-effects which makes the entire movie look more credible. Too bad Pitt hadn't won an Oscar for this role but got it for 12 Years a Slave where he just didn't have enough opportunities to show everything he's got. Madeleine Stowe play more important role than it might seem in the beginning.<br/><br/>I'd even say that she plays an almost central role. Not only is this movie amazing as a sci-fi movie, but it also has a very powerful romantic side as well. I'd even go so far as to say that sci-fi elements serve as means to reinforce romantic and personal struggles one faces in a world in which only some people decide ""whether something is right or wrong"".<br/><br/>I'll finish with a short note. This is one of those movies which, if seen correctly, can make you appreciate life more. It can provide you with material for reflection in forthcoming months. Be sure to get most out of it."

","Many time-travel films almost require viewers to hold a degree in quantum physics or be able wrap their brains around complicated concepts to understand the plot. Fortunately, ""12 Monkeys"" goes a different direction: it's a mind-bending, time-travel adventure that is both intellectually stimulating yet also easy enough to understand even for a casual viewer.<br/><br/>The basic plot of the film focuses on James Cole (Bruce Willis), a prisoner from ""the future"" (1997; where all surviving humans now live underground due to an apocalyptic event), who is sent back in time to try and gather information to prevent the catastrophe. While skipping through time, Cole meets two people, Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and mental patient Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who ultimately prove crucial to his mission of saving humanity from an underground existence.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this film is that while most time-travel plots are either overwhelming or overly simplistic, director Terry Gilliam finds the perfect mix here. Upon completion of viewing, I was quite certain that I understood what had just transpired (a feat never to be overlooked when dealing with time-travel). Only after some auxiliary study did I begin to consider some alternate interpretations, none of which cheapen that original reaction in any way.<br/><br/>The acting is also solid, with Willis progressing the Cole character very nicely (from completely lost--like the viewers--to informed and ready for action), Pitt turning in a good show as the manic Goines, and Stowe portraying the every-person who, like viewers, must be convinced that all of this is really happening.<br/><br/>I can recommend ""12 Monkeys"" to any and all fans of science fiction, mystery, suspense, and action films for its ability to strike the right balance between mind-stimulating material and overall comprehension (i.e. it doesn't let itself get bogged down in ideology or technicalities). Plus, I have found it to be a unique experience in that it can easily be viewed multiple times, as little tidbits can/will be noticed each time through."
"ElMaruecan82","9","2","3","31 December 2016"," What could have been a bizarre neo-""Brazil"" mess of a plot turns out to be a spellbinding and intelligent Sci-fi thriller, maybe Gilliam's masterpiece...
","""Twelve Monkeys"" is a Terry Gilliam movie, so you know you'll feel lucky if you gather half of the plot at the end of the film. <br/><br/>It is also a film whose story-line relies on time travels, swinging back and forth between the 90s urban hell and a dystopian future where humanity has been almost wiped from the surface of the Earth. The cinematography is so bleak and gritty that the future and the present (the past too) are like blue and red M&M's. But ever since ""Brazil"", we know Gilliam has an inclination toward urban nightmares and dehumanizing technology.<br/><br/>""Twelve Monkeys"" also centers on a protagonist named James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man who is so tormented that he can't even tell if he's really living his own reality. And in this exhausting ride, he meets a young fanatic poor man's prophet, played by Brad Pitt, and in his disjointed mambo jumbo, tries to grab some bits of truths that can help him to find shadows of truth in this existential mess. <br/><br/>So, basically, we have a movie made by the most anarchic and extravagant movie director (and he's quite polarizing on that level), playing on different time-lines and operating a real ping pong game of a narrative, and with psychological confusion to spice up an already complex plot. Yet, despite all these elements, this is perhaps the closest to a coherent and consistent plot I ever encountered in a Gilliam film. This is the film that could have been a bizarre nonsense, but it works, and the reason is quite simple: the film had a story, and much more, a compelling one.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to make a lecture about screen writing, but for all its complexity, the film makes no secret about the set-up and the primal mission: humanity has been wiped out by a mysterious plague (five billions is quite a death toll) and people have been forced to live under the ground while animals have taken over the Earth. And as a way to emphasize the cataclysmic aspect of humanity's future, even time travels won't prevent the plague from happening, this is no ""Back to the Future"", the film is set in a frozen time-line and what Cole can only do is bring samples or information about the original form of the virus so the scientists who sent him can study it in his present.<br/><br/>This is crucial because the film cleverly toys with its own premise: things are meant to happen and all humans can do is minimize the consequences. But there's a feeling of impending doom governing the script and while we try to believe in the 'happy ending', we know that whatever Cole will try to do, he'll only lead himself to what is meant to happen. The movie mentions the Cassandra's syndrome inherent to people who knows about the tragedy bound to happen but can't do anything to prevent it because no one would listen, this is Cole's tragedy, something in the same vein than Oedipus. There's a flashback memory scene repeating itself as some muddy leitmotif, it involves a young kid witnessing a murder in an airport, a blonde woman and man with a ponytail. Although we suspect what is going on, the climax doesn't lose any of its impact.<br/><br/>We're prepared to the finale, there's even a scene where the film ""Vertigo"" is screened on the theater and Cole knows this is his story in a nutshell, some dreamy vision and obsession with a girl, and a story that will keep repeating itself. That's the core of ""Twelve Monkeys"", it's a nightmarish time loop where a man is entrapped and where, during this short entrapment, he'll escape from his condition with a scientist played by Madeleine Stowe. And you've got to love the irony: just when he feels he might be wrong about himself, she's the one believing him. This is the soul of the film, a relationship between a man who couldn't even believe himself, and a woman who could but not to the point that she was able to stop the inevitable.<br/><br/>This is a formidable twist on the eternal obsession of Sci-fi geeks and their ""what if"" scenarios, you know: what if someone could go back in the past and kill Hitler or prevent September 11 from happening. ""Twelve Monkeys"", although relying on an improbable premise, perhaps features the most realistic take on time travels.<br/><br/>This is a jigsaw puzzle as a plot with great acting, including Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated performance that launched his career, proving that he wasn't just some Tom Cruise wannabe, and it all takes a second viewing to reassemble all the pieces and even get some hints of subtle brilliance. This is a real triumph from Gilliam who, for once, didn't indulge to some of his annoying trademarks and didn't punctuate the film with some crazy fights, and for a movie that deals with madness and a hero who suspects some things are made out of his mind, any spectacular intrusion of a dragon or a samurai wouldn't have surprised me.<br/><br/>But the British director restrained himself; he knew he got one hell of a story at hands, so there was no need to wrap it up in another extravagant fantasy. This lucidity made the film, as it is basically ""Brazil"" with a plot. And whenever someone will tell me that I have no reason to be skeptical over ""Brazil""'s reputation, I'll lay the ""Twelve Monkeys"" card and say that this is at least a film that features the same dystopian future, the same 'world is hell' message, the same maddening confusion, but it makes sense and not just on a psychological level. I was surprised of how emotionally involving it was.<br/><br/>I used to consider ""The Fisher King"" very highly but I might regard ""Twelve Monkeys"" as Terry Gilliam's masterpiece."

","This psychological thriller starring Bruce Willis is something beautiful to behold. A virus leaked in 1996 that wiped out most of the humans and let the animals roam free once again. The last of humanity lives underground in a nightmarish prison. In order to be pardoned, people will travel back in time to try to find information on the virus (It can't be stopped, it already happened). If the info is found the people in the ""present day"" (the future) can cure the virus. Bruce Willis is sent back and ends up in a mental hospital for what seems to be manic depressive paranoid schizophrenia. As the story goes on, this man learns quite a bit about the virus, and who created it, alongside of his psychiatrist who starts to believe him as evidence piles up proving so. Of course, this movie does a really good job at being ambiguous as to whether this is all really happening or if it's all within the mind of a cray person. So many little details in this movie give it an excellent story, with a compelling plot and characters. Brue Willis plays both crazy and non-crazy so well, you are never quite sure where he stands. Brad Pitt is an excellent secondary character as well. Altogether this is an under seen and underrated film.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This movie opens with ""... 5 Billion People Will Die From A Deadly Virus in 1997 ... The Survivors Will Abandon The Surface of The Planet ... Once Again The Animals Will Rule The World ..."" - Excerpts from Interview with clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, April 12, 1990 Baltimore County Hospital.<br/><br/>In a dystopic near-future, criminal James Cole (Bruce Willis) is forced to volunteer to go up to the surface and collect samples. He is given the opportunity to reduce his 25 to life sentence by time-traveling to 1996 and gather information on the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Back in 1990 Baltimore, county psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is brought in to examine James Cole after a fight with 2 cops. He is locked up in the county sanatorium where he meets manic babbling Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). He pleads to make a telephone call but the time hasn't come yet. He's suppose to be in 1996. Meanwhile he keeps having flashbacks of an incident as a kid. The future pulls him back but he's thrown back into the wrong time period again. When he finally arrives in the right time, he kidnaps Kathryn Railly.<br/><br/>This is chalk full of Terry Gilliam goodness originality. I love the craziness. I love his style. This is the closest to portraying madness coherently on the big screen. Bruce Willis inhabits the regular guy under stress and then there is the wild madness coming from Brad Pitt. Madeleine Stowe is also terrific. I love the various settings. I love the crazy future. I love the decaying present. I love the asylum. I love it all."

"Steffi_P","9","2","3","29 January 2012"," ""Certain unnamed realities""
","The future dystopia has been a staple of sci-fi movies for around forty years now, and for even longer in sci-fi novels. However there are only so many ways you can show the world going to buggery before it gets a bit samey. Twelve Monkeys however is a future dystopia movie that mostly sidesteps looking at said dystopia, and instead twists through time to reveal where things went wrong in the first place.<br/><br/>Although sometimes thought of as a non-linear movie, Twelve Monkeys in fact follows the personal timeline of its hero as he zips back and forth, and in broad outline is not actually amazingly complex. However, the David and Janet Peoples screenplay does not make any clear opening statements – apart from a couple of lines on a title card which are put in dubious context. We then plunge straight into the flowing narrative and have to glean what the movie's about in bits and pieces along the way. While this demands close attention from the viewer, it works very well to embroil us in the world of a confused outsider.<br/><br/>This confusion and oddity is deepened in the approach of director Terry Gilliam, who uses rather overt stylisation to make the world of Twelve Monkeys as distorted and alien as possible. His near-constant Dutch angles and claustrophobic camera positions (racked up or toned down depending on protagonist Cole's mental state) could easily become tiresome, but the focus on macabre set design, unusual faces and familiar objects made to look outlandish allows us to get swept up in the wonkiness of the whole creation. At times, watching it feels a bit like being unpleasantly drunk. But don't let this fool you into thinking there isn't precision to all this. Knowing that the story often relies upon the audience recalling some tiny detail, Gilliam uses a number of cunning tricks to fix something in our memories, for example Madeleine Stowe's distorted voice on the words ""Merry Christmas"" or the fact that Dr Peters has those distinctive ginger locks.<br/><br/>As Gilliam garnered his reputation as a belligerent maverick, he also began to work with more and more prestigious Hollywood stars. Twelve Monkeys sees Bruce Willis in a role that is arguably to his type, with a fair bit of macho action, but with a presentation that is very much counter to his usual confident demeanour. He's actually very effective in this lonely, vulnerable guise, seeming mysterious yet sympathetic. The most memorable turn is that of an exuberant Brad Pitt. Pitt's madman act is derived mostly from the hammy madman acts of Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper, and it's really just as overdone, although there is some amazingly complicated business he's doing with his fingers that is at the very least distinctive. Gilliam seems to have achieved the impossible and make Pitt look, not unattractive as such, but disappointingly plain. Madeleine Stowe gives a strong and steady performance, a credible turn in what is really the only straight dramatic role. Her best highlight – and the most poignant moment in the whole picture – is that ghost of a smile in her final scene.<br/><br/>While Twelve Monkeys in many areas falls some way short of perfection, it works better than many movies with stronger components, simply because good or bad everything is of a piece. Pitt's overacting, Gilliam's extrovert camera, the improbable converging of events in the storyline, these all fit in with the strange and giddy rhythm of the movie and its grim yet oddly sentimental mood. It is far from the typical sci-fi fare that gets the geeks salivating, but it is an absorbing thriller and one that, even through its unreality, carries a striking humanity."
"Lucabrasisleeps","10","2","3","1 January 2009"," Complex and engaging thriller
","I can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. It is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still I can't decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first movie of Terry Gilliam that I have seen. My first impression? I was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex(to be confusing).<br/><br/>The movie is set in the future. A man James Cole(Bruce Willis) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past(1996 to be specific). A virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to get some information about it. Also involved here are a psychiatrist called Kathryn Railly. The love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life. The loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life. ""You want to see the ocean, be with her"" is especially a poignant line in this movie. It chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. Therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. The complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters.<br/><br/>The performances are quite good. Bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. His desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. I have to check out his other movies. The gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is quite a treat to watch. EVer since I saw this movie, I have become so obsessed with her. She has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him.<br/><br/>The end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. The length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. And every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary.<br/><br/>Good thriller 10/10"

","A killer virus in 1996 has wiped out billions of people, in the year 2035, a convict is selected to go back in time and gather information about the virus' origins.<br/><br/>It took me a few viewings to firmly get close to just how marvellous this film is, nothing at first is ever crystal clear, even now after watching it again I find my partner and I having differing opinions as regards the finale. So with that in mind I really wont expand on the plot structure of the film, if you haven't seen then I urge you to do so, and then watch again and again until its glory hits you in the face.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys finds director Terry Gilliam crafting his mind meddling panache with other peoples sources, writers David & Janet Peoples (Blade Runner & Unforgiven) to be exact. The Peoples extract the best premise from French short La Jetée, give it a pounding time jumping head spin, and then gleefully thriving on the paranoia of killer virus' that were laying waste to many in the 1990s. Enter Gilliam to bring it all together, showing restraint from his outlandish (yet incredible) vision that he used for Brazil in 1985, Twelve Monkeys still ends up something of a complex masterpiece without over stretching the viewers' patience. There is no glossy Hollywood smears in the film, this isn't the type of film where Bruce Willis (never better) saves the day and cracks a quip at the end, or a film where Brad Pitt (again, rarely better) shows off his pectorals to get bums on seats in the theatre, this is a cold unnerving film that demands not only to be watched, but also respected.<br/><br/>Now about that ending...........thank you Terry Gilliam, genius. 9/10"

","After a virus wipes out no less than 5 billion members of the human race in 1996-1997 (just a year after the film was released, pessimistic much?), the remaining survivors are forced to take refuge underground, leaving animals to rule above ground level. The lead character James Cole, a convict, is sent back in time to 1996 to gather information on the virus for scientific study, but arrives six years early in 1990 and is put into a mental institution, at which point the plot becomes too complicated to easily sum up, which just makes it all the more surprising how effective this screenplay is.<br/><br/>""Twelve Monkeys"" is a dream come true for science fiction fans. In a genre market over-saturated with space operas, borderline fantasy action films, and straight to DVD garbage, it is extremely rare that a compelling, challenging, and intelligent movie like ""Twelve Monkeys"" even gets made. What's even better than the fact that this got made is that it got top-notch treatment. The talent behind and in front of the camera is astonishing. Directed almost flawlessly by Terry Gilliam, the film is brilliantly-acted, shot, and scored. Standout performances include Bruce Willis in the lead and Brad Pitt in a manic performance that proves he is not just a mildly talented Hollywood star.<br/><br/>The film's rather complicated time travel plot is admirably handled in the script by David Webb Peoples (who also has to his credit Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction classic ""Blade Runner"" and Clint Eastwood's 1992 revisionist Western ""Unforgiven"") and Janet Peoples. Cinematography and score among other technical elements are of a high order and help bring the screenplay to life. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is the outstanding production design. It happens so often that good ideas get shoddy execution in genre films, but here you have one which is so well-designed that on occasion the visuals are so fascinating you'll miss a crucial bit of information because you weren't listening properly. <br/><br/>""Twelve Monkeys"" is a dense and difficult film and is certainly not simplistic popcorn entertainment, but this is a film that rewards careful analysis and multiple viewings more than most others. This is an intelligent and captivating science fiction film which is extraordinarily acted and comes together beautifully.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I ask for only one thing in a time travel story: Whatever rules you establish for how it works and what the effects of paradox are, you follow them. They can be totally ridiculous from the standpoint of both physics and common sense, but whatever rules are established early in the story must be obeyed as the story continues.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys does this. There are a couple of points where the story could cheat, but the director/writer avoided the temptation. On top of being internally consistent, the plot is compelling and the ending is dramatic. The sterile future world contrasts well with the dirty polluted world of the past, and viewers will slowly understand the irony that it is the dirty, polluted world that the time travelers are hoping to restore by changing the past. <br/><br/>A beautiful film."

"dee.reid","10","2","3","31 January 2007"," Gilliam's ""Twelve""
","It's been a while since I've seen ""Twelve Monkeys,"" but I still remember that it is most definitely one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, perhaps one of the best of the 1990s. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is a fascinating piece of science fiction, with ""elements"" thrown into the mix that can only be the work of director Terry Gilliam. The script by David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples, inspired by the original French film ""La Jette"" by Chris Marker, tells the tale of a future planet Earth in the year 2035, after a deadly virus has decimated mankind and humans are forced to live underground. Of course, there are criminal elements, and one of these outcasts, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is offered a chance at a clean slate if he volunteers for a mission that is literally out-of-this-world: travel back in time to the year 1996 to gather up information on the virus so scientists in the future can develop a cure. But a mishap occurs and he's sent too far back to the year 1990. Once there, he is hospitalized as insane and meets a wacky fellow inmate named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) and is cared for by a disbelieving doctor (Madeleine Stowe), who eventually grows to realize Cole's telling the truth. Cole is bounced back and forth between the future and the past so much that he eventually grows disillusioned by his own perception of reality, unsure what time he's in or where. Like Cole's ordeal, the film ""Twelve Monkeys"" packs a mental punch; we too become unsure of our surroundings and great effort was made by the filmmakers to create such confusion. The performances are pretty astounding, especially from Willis (whose ""acting"" ranks as some of his finest) and Pitt, who's an absolute blast and provides some gallows humor, but to be perfectly clear he's totally loony, and may or may not be linked to the group of young, radical animal-rights activists responsible for the unleashing of the virus. Gilliam's imagination again runs rampant in another ""future"" tale, like his earlier ""Brazil"" (1985). ""Twelve Monkeys,"" to be sure, is one wild trip that is definitely worth taking.<br/><br/>10/10"
"p_adkins2004","9","2","3","20 December 2006"," Dystopian visions
","Directed by the master of dystopian visions, Terry Gilliam, Twelve Monkey bombards the audience with a complex, yet digestible, film - which unlike it's fellows in the genre, is also heatwarming. Bradd Pitt and Bruce Willis enter career altering roles, which demonstrate their immense talent and no doubt paved their way for future roles.<br/><br/>The direction and photography of everything from the set pieces to the 1996 Philidelphia are breathtaking, to the point where the viewer is fully emerged in the film, becoming part of the concept - yet still being aware enough to fit the jigsaw plot together.<br/><br/>This film is a true classic and my favourite Gilliam film (although Brazil is very close), I think it will go down in history as one of the best sleeper hits of the 1990s. It has certainly paved the way for future films of a similar films (just look at the clear resemblances to Gilliam ideas in films such as Children Of Men).<br/><br/>Also if you pick up the DVD, the additional documentary film 'The Hamster Factor' is a very insightful view not only into Gilliam's film but the entire Hollywood studio process."

","Anyone familiar with Terry Gilliam's work will know he is a man who loves the weird, the eccentric and the bizarre. In case you were wondering, this is the guy responsible for Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It was this very tendency towards the outrageous that kept him at arm's length with production company Universal Pictures, up until the release of 1985's ""Brazil"", written and directed by Gilliam. When this risk of a picture paid off, it earned him some credit with Universal, allowing him to later accept the position of director for David and Janet Peoples' ""Twelve Monkeys"".<br/><br/>The year is 2035, and the dregs of humanity have been driven underground by the spread of a virus that has wiped out 80% of the population, leaving the surface to the animals. In an attempt to obtain a pure sample of the virus, scientists send ""voluntary"" convict James Cole (Bruce Willis) back in time to 1996. Upon arrival, Cole is mistaken for a crazy man and put into a mental institution. While here he meets beautiful psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and deranged mad-man Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). Soon he becomes irreversibly caught up in the lives of these people, and the lines between reality and insanity become dangerously unclear<br/><br/>Who would've thought that one of the Monty Python boys could turn this rather clichéd Sci-Fi flick into something new and exciting? And yet that's exactly what's happened. Gilliam's extraordinary vision keeps the film just surreal enough throughout that the audience is guessing to the end as to Cole's true state of mind, in a masterful manipulation of audience response, on a par with David Lynch.<br/><br/>The most intriguing thing about Gilliam's characteristically idiosyncratic film noir venture is its eerie, almost apocalyptic depiction of modern America. Through the eyes of Willis' confused and emotionally vulnerable character, the world as we know it seems darker, more sinister and the society thereupon built seems to ominously and unknowlingly teeter on the verge of a inevitable tragedy. ""All I see are dead people"", Cole despairingly confides in Dr. Railly, with a depressing conviction that for once has the audience actually hopeful that the main character is crazy.<br/><br/>Working with this are some simply superb performances from the lead cast. It was agreed by both Gilliam and Willis from an early point that this was not to be a typical ""Bruce Willis"" movie, in that it was going to be more character-depth and less action. Willis delivers on his promise, giving an emotionally restrained performance as the confused and vulnerable James Cole, unsure of his own hold on reality in a world that feels strangely familiar. Madeline Stowe is competent as always, but it's no secret that the star is Brad Pitt, who should have won an Oscar for this disturbingly convincing portrayal of a complete and total nutter.<br/><br/>And if all this weren't enough, the film's been given an erratic, discordant accordion score to boot; interspersed when thematically necessary with more harmonious string section, depending, of course, on whichever of the two Cole is feeling. <br/><br/>All up, ""Twelve Monkeys"" manages to be a surprisingly unique interpretation of what could have been a dull repetition of decades of the genre, almost to the extent of which it creates a genre of its own. Impressive stuff."

Performance wise this movie is great, you have some good material from Stowe and Willis but most importantly Pitt (got Golden Globe for best supporting actor and was nominated for an Academy Award) who adds in a looney performance similar to his role in Fight Club.

But I don't think it knows it's an apocalyptic vision.<br/><br/>The film is about James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man from the future who goes back in time to stop the disaster that sent him underground from ever happening. But that's the simple way of describing it. The story is in a constant fight as to where to go with the plot, with probably a dozen sub-ideas that could turn into something. It's twisted and elaborate and almost impossible to explain to someone without them saying ""what?"", but like ""Memento"" or ""The Matrix"", when you watch it, it makes sense. But these plot developements are delicious fodder and keep it moving, allowing characters like Brad Pitt's pitch perfect sort-of-insane ""Jeffrey Bowen"" to take a bow (deserved that Oscar nod, BTW). <br/><br/>The film's eccentricity takes hold of it. From the cinematography, to the accordian theme that playfully plays throughout the film, to the excessive production design that you know was made that way just because they felt like it (though it does help make the film what it is). And more often than not, the miserable conditions of Mr. Willis or whoever else may be feeling miserable at the time come across the screen in an almost tangible way.<br/><br/>But behind the running cinematic joke, and the dark atmosphere of the film, it drives itself home where it must, and Bruce Willis, surprisingly, performs in what is probably one of his best roles. There's a frusterating and pitiful scene when he is desperately trying to make psychiatrists in 1990 accept the fact that he's from the future. They don't buy it, and he realizes that on top of his original task, he now has to find some tedious way to make these people believe him. Teamed with the talented Madeleine Stowe, the duo help create a touching relationship that grounds the film, as it turns out, on a deep personal level.<br/><br/>The film doesn't necessarily scare you into thinking all this would happen in real life, we've heard it too much before, and I don't think that was the goal of the movie. But by the end of the film you've been given a healthy sense of dread for the poor characters in the film. How often does that happen? Though when they play the Louis Armstrong classic ""Wonderful World"" during the credits, it stamps and seals the irony of it all, and does exactly what Mr. Armstrong probably didn't intend the song to do in the first place."

Turns out the pandemic is real, while not nearly as deadly as this film's (yet). Time Travel, OTOH, ain't happening anytime soon. Damn.<br/><br/>B: I really wish they'd given Gilliam ""Dune"". While I love Lynch, Gilliam's insanity would've had a field day with that material.<br/><br/>Anyway, see this if you haven't. It's one of Gilliam's best, and, as pointed out by other iMDb reviewers, it's a great performance by Willis, filmed back when ol' Bruno still gave a crap about the acting craft. There's some real nuance in this. If you asked, even Silent Bob might agree..."

","If you are somehow aware of a future apocalypse, and you tell it to the people, you would be treated as crazy. It is called Cassandra Complex, derived from a Greek legend, and is what happens to the protagonist Cole.<br/><br/>Cole, a prisoner in the dystopian world of 2035, is send to 1990, and later to 1996. We learn from him that 99% of human race will be eradicated in 1996 and 1997 by a deadly virus, and his purpose is to obtain information about the virus before it mutates.<br/><br/>He explains his situation to the people, and naturally is put in a mental asylum. He is a rough and vulgar man, having volunteered to the task only for a pardon, but somewhat shows a sense of duty, as heroes played by Bruce Willis always do. He meets Kathryn, a beautiful and sympathetic psychiatrist who you would want to make believe yourself more than anyone else. Actually how she comes to believe him is the most interesting part of the film.<br/><br/>As a time-travel mystery, the plot is quite complicated. To be honest, I needed some help from explanation websites to understand the details after watching it. It seems to me that some pointless distractions make it more complicated than necessary. And although I know he was nominated for an Oscar for the role, I don't find the Brad Pitt character that interesting or attractive, compared with the two leading characters, and even with the creepy David Morse.<br/><br/>But it still has true tension and thrill that compel you to follow the story to the end. It's exciting to watch the time-travelling twists where an act can solve a problem and cause a new problem at the same time. I love the scenes from the post-apocalyptic 2035, like scientists singing Blueberry Hill and the face of an elderly female scientiest magnified in a lens. The entire film is filled with dizziness and nightmare, but strangely beautiful."

","I can't believe it took me so long to finally watch this gem, although I am a hardcore Gilliam fan (but obviously not hardcore enough to watch his 160 Mill box office runs, haha).<br/><br/>He started small and came up with a very expensive looking production design, featuring vintage sci-fi, steampunk and many weird twists. I was impressed by the interrogation room (although they used designs by Lebbeus Woods), the interrogation device ball, the use of abandoned opera buildings, rehabilitation centre (as mental institution) and re-building an airport terminal in a regular congress hall. The worn-down atmosphere's and no-man's-land-sceneries add enormously to the dark vibe, which is contrasted by the sweet, melancholic orchestra/tango music by Astor Piazolla as soundtrack. Once again, like in Brazil, Tideland and what-not films, the sceneries are just WOW.<br/><br/>I also loved the camera framing (e.g. often VERY tilted wide angle lenses when it comes to true scenes of madness, e.g. with Brad Pitt in the mental institution - maximum distortion of reality) - and it was the first time, I saw Brad Pitt actually doing some serious acting that was NOT based on the normal personas/character's he's used to play. Same goes for Bruce Willis, showing him in one of his rare not-in-character roles (weak, vulnerable Bruce here, wow!).<br/><br/>Overall, I also enjoyed the documentary based on the film production of 12 monkeys and it gives a lot of insight into the whole process. Gilliam is for sure one of those directors who loses his heart to the production and works with a wonderful team (and is not afraid to tell the world about the fact that he's merely sorting the strings while other great artists on his team pull them). I am sure, he'd be LOST without the ability to make movies.<br/><br/>I am so happy that UNIVERSAL gave him the money to produce the film and Gilliam battled his way through all the hollywood-ish guidelines to produce something that features HIS known style and voice. Sure, there are other films that are even more ""gilliameske"", but this one had enough budget to pull off a really impressive production design, actors, filming team and what not!<br/><br/>I did really enjoy the film visually - and yes, storywise, too: it takes a few watches to truly grasp all the hidden details and there are many ways to interpret this - for sure it fires up the brain-machine to do some work. So go, see it - it is and remains a groundbreaking science fiction film of that era!"

","As far as 'futuristic-apocalyptic sci-fi movies' goes, it's a really minimalist take on that idea tbh... there's no flying cars or robots, though there is some time-traveling, which really is the extent of the 'futuristic' theme in the movie. The movie was OK, but it fell into a weird little crevice where there's not enough action for it to be considered an action movie, and not enough drama/suspense for it to be considered a full drama either. The movie deals with time-travel AND teleportation, so you'll be left thinking ""WTF just happened?"" multiple times in the movie because of it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance in the movie however, out-shines everyone else in the movie... it's so good, his performance is damn near blinding!"

","I first saw ""Twelve Monkeys"" when it was freshly released. I was totally confused and couldn't follow the plot at all, even though I wasn't that young. I thought it was total nonsense, and, since I well-educated in the sciences, I just generally considered time-travel plots to be tripe.<br/><br/>Wow, how things change with time. I really get the movie this time around, and, very surprisingly, because of the way that time travel is used in the plot, I think that element of the movie worded brilliantly well. This is just a super strong film for which Bruce Willis is perfectly cast (like most movie stars, they only really ""work"" in a limited number of roles). To me the only thing that puts me off a bit is that they seem to have raided most of the set and the same make-up artists from ""Brazil"". It's not that the movie was really hurt with this apparent economy, but that it could have benefited from a little bit more originality in these elements. Still, I'm really just picking nits.<br/><br/>Initially, I was going to just write off this film and not watch it again, but I' super glad that I didn't do that. What's more embarrassing is that I was watching the movie with a guy well into his social security years who's really into Sci-Fi and he didn't have any problem following the plot at all. Makes me feel like a moron. Still a great movie, although I might not be the genius I like to think I am. In an event, if Sci-Fi is your thing, I can't recommend this brain-twister high enough."

"truemythmedia","8","1","1","15 June 2019"," Gilliam to Revisit Again and Again
","The more I explore certain directors, the more I realize that many of them are only really trying to grapple with one or two themes over and over again in different settings. This is definitely how I feel about Terry Gilliam. It won't come as a shock to any of my readers that ""12 Monkeys"" deals with themes of sanity/insanity, reality, fantasy, identity, resistance of authority and cultural manipulations, destiny, and legend. You could say the same about ""Brazil,"" ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,"" or ""The Fisher King.""<br/><br/>What makes ""12 Monkeys"" a lesser-Gilliam-film is that it doesn't do those things as well, with as much dear characterization, or tongue in cheek darkness as his other films. Bruce Willis' (""The Sixth Sense"") James Cole isn't an especially interesting character as he is more of a puzzler than an actor. He mostly just thinks about the army of the twelve monkey and how he might stop them from carrying out a dastardly plan that sends humanity to the brink of extinction but at the end of the day I don't really care about him that much. His journey doesn't move me. In a film that is about exploring the edges of our protagonists reality and sanity that is a huge problem.<br/><br/>Enough about the things that don't work. This is Gilliam so the fun is in what does. The production design, as always, is top notch. Even though much of the film takes place in ""the normal world"" Gilliam is able to draw out the extreme nature of the mind jam that Cole is in by creating the extreme environments he interacts within. The asylum, the 1 2 Twelve Monkeys HQ, and the airport are all hyper realities that blend with the future underground world in tone. This is needed to keep the illusion that either world could be true or both or neither. If one looks and feels remarkably different than the other then it seems to be a clear delineation between reality and falsehood.<br/><br/>Gilliam is the master of this. He makes the insane seem real and the truth seem incredible. He blends them in a way few directors are capable of, using exactly the elements which another film would see as too extreme as the subtle hints to the audience that the entire world is insane.<br/><br/>When I say that this is a lesser-Gilliam film, I don't mean that I think that or even that it isn't very popular. It is a highly rated film but I think that is mainly because of his films, ""12 Monkeys"" is far more accessible and therefore, says less and says it with less deft sleight of hand and nebulous morality than his other films. The very thing that makes it more in the eyes of many is what make it less in the eyes of others."

","Twelve Monkeys, a1995 scifi movie that proves that producing an epic scifi is beyond any special effect or technology capabilities.
The storyline is engaging, it makes the all the characters have a real role in the movie and not merely supporters for the main character, Brad Pitt is indeed brilliant, explaining why he got an Oscar nomination. However, in my humble opinion, the acting chemistry between Bruce Willis and the talented Madeleine Stowe make this a memorable movie.

An old picture from a World War One history book. The feeling (by several characters) that they have ""been there"" before. Like ""Kpax"" the ""hero"" (Bruce Willis) is thought insane, so much so that he begins to doubt his own sanity. He is from the future but has no gadgets and arrives almost naked. He is yanked back and forth through time and is ""volunteered"" to try and stop a madman from releasing a plague that destroys 90% of the Earth's population. It's haunting, but not really enjoyable as we all know that ""you can't change the future"", or so we are told.

"classicsoncall","8","1","1","8 November 2017"," ""Maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out.""
","I approached this picture with some trepidation, as I caught Bruce Willis in ""The Fifth Element"" some years ago and wasn't impressed by that sci-fi story at all. This one I thought was pretty well done considering the time travel aspect involved, something that can usually make your head spin but in this film you could keep track of things if you paid attention. A neat thing I learned coming out of the picture was the definition of a Cassandra complex, a psychological phenomenon in which someone's accurate prediction of a crisis is ignored or dismissed. How often do we hear after the fact that someone had a premonition of an earthquake or a plane crash and decided to change their plans? Kind of spooky.<br/><br/>This was a bit of a different kind of role for Bruce Willis. He wasn't called on for those smug looks he's known for and he wasn't a hot shot who had all the answers. As good as he was though, you have to hand it to Brad Pitt for his manic portrayal of mental patient Jeffrey Goines. I've thought about it for a while now, and if I ever had the opportunity to appear in a movie, it would be as the kind of character Pitt role-modeled here. I thought he was a little over the top at times, but again, he was a mental patient, or shall we use James Cole's (Willis) definition - mentally divergent.<br/><br/>Following the story along in it's non-linear approach wasn't too difficult, but there were a couple of things that didn't pass muster for this viewer. A romantic involvement between Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Cole? I don't care how much they might have gone through, that was just too far fetched for me. Also, there's no way one can make the case for Young Cole and the Bruce Willis Cole to exist in the same time and place. I know, it happened in ""Back to the Future"" too, but I'm not buying it.<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed the twists that popped up in the movie and the dystopian feel of the picture's setting didn't intrude on the story. It could be I caught this one in just the right frame of mind to find it entertaining, enough so I might give ""The Fifth Element"" another try. Oh yeah, I got a big kick out of a Bruce Willis line in the story when he said to Kathryn Railly - ""All I see are dead people"". I would never have guessed that ""The Sixth Sense"" came out four years after this one."

","In a futuristic world where most of the human race has gone extinct as a result of a purposely released virus, convict James is sent into the past, numerous times, in a desperate attempt to discover the author and try to develop a cure. Bruce Willis' character, with his time travels, seems to become more and more confused about which is the present or which is reality, beginning to doubt his mental condition. At the same time, he must focus on the mission he has been assigned, fact which will prove to be more problematic than expected, as he is easily stolen by the beauty of nature, as he's never seen it before. Add a female psychiatrist to the equation and you'll get a very complex and tangled storyline in which James struggles to find his place.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed its plot, I feel that James is being dragged away from one place to another, always being the wrong man at the wrong time, always suffering or being injured and thus, being unable to do more to defend the beloved or to advance into his investigation. Although unexpected and unpredictable as the entire movie, I was somehow disappointed by its finale, which doesn't do anything to bring the slightest change to the apocalyptic situation."

","The first time I saw 12 Monkeys was (gulp!) about 20 years ago (wow time flies). I saw it again this evening and the impetus for me watching it again was the self same titled TV series on SyFy. As I was watching the TV show I began wondering how much likeness it had to the movie as my memory of 20 years ago is a little fuzzy. Just to digress a bit... I know where Willis and Pitt have been the last 20 years, but where has Madeleine Stowe (Kathryn Railly) been? <br/><br/>12 Monkeys is definitely one of my favorite time travel movies. It does suffer from the same paradox and conundrum issues that a lot of time travel movies do, especially when the time travel is to prevent a particular event (i.e. if you went back in time to stop said event and were successful there would no longer exist a reason to go back in time which leads to the question: would that same event still occur since you never went back to stop it????). Paradoxes aside, the movie was a blast.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt did a bang up job as the certifiably insane, Jeffrey Goines. I had forgotten just how cuckoo he was in the movie and how well he did as a nut case. Willis was decent as well. I almost forgot he did non action-hero roles. The accordion rich, French music score ground my gears a little bit but it wasn't too distracting. And I couldn't be too upset considering the movie was based upon the French film ""La Jetee"". The story was gold, so much so they've made a TV show based upon the movie. Another, now, oldie but goodie from the 90's."

","An intriguing portrait of a dystopian future, an insane meditation on madness & an interesting take on the idea of time travel, reality & memories, Twelve Monkeys must've been one of the most creative examples of science-fiction filmmaking when it was released but looking back now, it doesn't feel as impressive anymore despite the innumerable twists & turns it has to offer.<br/><br/>The story of Twelve Monkeys presents a future in which almost all of humanity has been annihilated by a deadly virus which has forced the remaining survivors to live beneath the surface. The plot concerns a convict who's sent back in time to collect more data on the man- made virus, which seems to be connected to a mysterious organization called The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.<br/><br/>Directed by Terry Gilliam, the film has a strangely unnerving atmosphere looming over it from start to finish which is further helped by its eccentric set pieces, clever use of camera angles & unconventional editing which tries to engage the viewers with its constantly shifting tones & twists. And its background score is no slouch either for it further enhances its moody ambiance.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast of Twelve Monkeys stars Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt & Madeleine Stowe, and all three of them are crazily good in their given roles. Willis chips in strongly as the convict who's sent back in time, Pitt is completely deranged in his role but is also the most impressive of the three, and Stowe's character is able to hold on to her sanity for the most part.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Twelve Monkeys is full of intricate themes, ideas & homages that's presented in a manner not everyone is going to enjoy. It does play with the viewers' minds & is a bold piece of filmmaking but its acting also comes off as exaggerated on many occasions, its romance subplot feels unnecessary, the entire production appears somewhat dated & for me, it also failed to live up to its legacy. Multiple viewings advised."
"sddavis63","8","1","1","31 January 2015"," Brilliantly Disorienting
","This certainly isn't your average, run of the mill movie about time travel. It's a confusing and disorienting story that left me at least guessing for much of its run time about what actually was reality. The performance from Bruce Willis was wonderful. As James Cole, he plays a prisoner in a nightmar-ish future earth, where most of humanity has been wiped out by a virus, and the remainder have had to retreat underground. Cole is chosen to go back into the past to the point just before the plague erupted, not to prevent it - because you can't prevent what's already happened - but to bring a sample of the virus back to his time.<br/><br/>Willis did a marvellous job with this character. He is himself disoriented from the start (time travel isn't as easy as some movies make it out to be) and, making no sense to anyone he speaks to, he finds himself locked up in a mental institution.<br/><br/>It's in the mental institution that we meet the other two central characters: Dr. Raillis (Madeleine Stowe), who starts with the assumption that Cole is insane but gradually comes to believe his story, and Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines, the unbalanced son of a famous scientist who's central to how the virus is released.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie is that almost to the end, as a viewer I had some doubts about Cole: was he really from the future or was he delusional. That's finally answered, but it took a while and it was fun to speculate. <br/><br/>It's a well done movie, often chaotic and confusing and disorienting, which was actually a good way of getting the viewer into the head of Cole, who must have been feeling exactly the same way.

Probably Gilliam's biggest success to that time, and possibly still his biggest success today (2014), though he continues to make great films. And looking back on it, approximately twenty years later, it is as good as ever. They took ""La Jetee"" and fleshed out an entire world.<br/><br/>Beyond the great concept, excellent sets and impressive cast (Brad Pitt in a break-out role) is a story that is so cleverly layered. Is Cole a time traveler? Is he crazy? Is the Army of the 12 Monkeys real? Who are they? And can the future be changed?"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","15 December 2014"," Bruce Willis & Terry Gilliam team up for a memorable sci-fi flick
","Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys"" is a modern science fiction classic inspired by a celebrated French short film from 1962 (Chris Marker's ""La Jetée""). Set in the near future (at the time), the movie accomplishes the rare feat of living up to its inspiration (and, arguably, surpassing it).<br/><br/>The story's protagonist is James Cole (Bruce Willis), a man who supposedly travels some forty years back in time in order to gather data related to a catastrophic viral outbreak. In addition to biological samples, he seeks information concerning a mysterious group known as the 'Army of the 12 Monkeys'. However, this fantastic scenario may be all in his head, which is what psychologist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is arguing. Nevertheless, Railly feels strangely drawn to Cole for reasons that elude her.<br/><br/>The cast is a pretty good one with both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt contributing performances that significantly depart from their usual star roles. Pitt landed an Oscar nomination for his performance as a manic mental patient who may be the mastermind behind the shadowy 'Army of the 12 Monkeys'. Bruce Willis was scarcely less impressive in the demanding lead role. The female lead, Madeleine Stowe, also performed well in a less showy role. Apart from the principles, though, the cast is mostly undistinguished, barring a few exceptions like Christopher Plummer and David Morse.<br/><br/>Directorially, the movie is distinguished by Terry Gilliam's unique vision. Odd camera angles and freakish settings produce a visual experience that mirrors the main character's doubts regarding his sanity. The memorable main theme enforces this feel, while the other soundtrack choices (including Fats Domino's ""Blueberry Hill"" and Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"") contribute an interesting sense of nostalgia. Though the cinematography may be fairly dull at times, this is acceptable as it was an intentional stylistic choice.<br/><br/>Where ""12 Monkeys"" arguably shines brightest is in the sometimes convoluted but always compelling storyline. Taking a setting & concept that isn't entirely novel, the screenwriters managed to craft an involving science fiction story that successfully juggles reality & delusion. While I'm not sure of how first time viewers will react, it's a story that continues to hold my interest after multiple viewings.<br/><br/>In the end, it's difficult to predict someone's reception to this movie since it is somewhat demanding. You'd be advised to pay close attention due to the narrative shifts and ever-present questioning of Cole's sanity. However, attentive viewers should be rewarded with an uncommonly well-realized science fiction movie that ranks among the best of the genre."
"bowmanblue","8","1","1","27 November 2014"," Python meets Terminator
","'Twelve Monkeys' is Terry Gilliam's mind-bending time travel epic which tells the story of convict, Bruce Willis, being repeatedly sent back in time to discover the cause of a mysterious virus which wiped out 99% of humanity.<br/><br/>It doesn't have Terminator's action sequences, but the plot is kind of similar, plus Gilliam shows his flair for depicting his weird vision of the future by showing us a world that is a cross between Brazil and Time Bandits.<br/><br/>Despite Bruce Willis not always receiving that much praise for his acting abilities, he comes across pretty well here as a vulnerable and confused man, trying to make sense of the weird situation he finds himself in. (A very young) Brad Pitt also co-stars and steals every scene with his odd eyes and borderline psychotic personality disorders.<br/><br/>It's a great film, but you have to be in the mood for it. I've watched it about three times in the space of nearly twenty years and loved it every time. I have to feel like sitting down and really trying to get my head around who's doing what and why.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's not just like Terminator where bad guys fight good guys. You may have to think a little with this one. If you're a fan of Terry Gilliam's work, you should love this. If you've never seen anything he's done before, you may have to tread carefully with this one and check out some more reviews before you decide to commit over two hours to looking into his twisted mind."
"Tweekums","9","1","1","15 October 2014"," A fine time-travel movie
","In the not too distant future, in a world that has been decimated by a plague, James Cole's dreams are haunted by a childhood memory. In this memory he is at an airport and he sees a man gunned down while a woman looks on in anguish. Cole is volunteered for a special mission to find the source of the plague; most notably what it has to do with the 'Army of the Twelve Monkeys'. This mission involves being sent back in time to 1996 at least that is the idea; in fact he ends up in 1990 and is promptly certified insane! Here he meets psychiatrist Kathryn Railly and fellow patient Jeffrey Goines and has a profound effect on each of them before he vanishes from a locked room. The next time Kathryn sees him is when he kidnaps her in 1996 and demands that she take him to Philadelphia; he is raving like a madman but eventually she starts to believe him but if what he says is really true most of humanity will be dead soon.<br/><br/>This is one of the best time travel films; Terry Gilliam's way of showing us the story makes us wonder if the protagonist might be insane even though we've seen that what he claims is true. Bruce Willis does a fine job as Cole; a man on a mission who is also forced to question his own sanity. Madeleine Stowe puts is a solid performance as Railly and Brad Pitt is great as the obviously crazy Goines. There is a good sense of danger and not just to the Protagonists; it is clear that Cole is dangerous to those around him. Some films are best just watched once but this stands up to repeat viewings; indeed knowing the ending will help you see new details when you watch it again. While the ending isn't exactly a surprise it still has an emotional impact. Overall this fine film is well worth watching if you like sci-fi that is a little strange!"

Maybe its a bit of all of it because 12 Monkeys has all of this.<br/><br/>The way this film is made, you can actually keep up with what is going on even though there is travel in time happening - not like some time travel films where you can't tell where they are or where they have been half the time.

","This time travel movie is definitely up there in my favorites! Brad Pitt is amazing as the crazy side character he plays. Bruce Willis completely pulls off the confusion and disorientation of his time traveling. Terry Gilliam does an excellent job crafting a heck of a strange world for us to explore.<br/><br/>I am starting to notice a trend in time travel movies, where they end up dark and horrible. I guess maybe this is just a natural extension of what might happen if we actually did discover time travel was possible, but whatever it is, I like it! In a world of commercial movies where there's a lot of emphasis on having a happy ending, this movie (as well as Timecrimes, and some of the others in this genre) aren't afraid to show us just how scary things might get. <br/><br/>For anyone interested in time travel movies, I recommend this one for sure!"

I also loved he inevitable approach to the future, that there really is nothing we can do. I found that interesting. The set design, because this is Gilliam we're talking about, was also very, very beautiful, descriptive, gritty, and raw. I don't want to get into the details of the plot but all i can say is that it has its twists. Definitely one of GIlliam's best and one of the most entrapping films I've seen in quite some time."

"bkrauser-81-311064","9","1","1","6 December 2013"," Terry Gilliam's Take on the Future
","""5 billion people will die from a deadly virus in 1997...the survivors will abandon the surface of the planet...once again the animals will rule the world."" Thus with these words, Twelve Monkeys (1995) begins its opening credits. It's an ominous prologue for an ambiguous yet amazing movie brought into the world by writers David and Janet Peoples and molded into a tangible and indelible entity by director Terry Gilliam. Yet to say Twelve Monkeys is a tale about a dystopian future would be an understatement.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys begins with our hero James Cole (Bruce Willis) waking up from a reoccurring dream, seemingly placed in a prison of sorts against his will. His is to be volunteered for a mission on the surface of the earth. He is then informed by a group of scientists that they have the ability to time travel and can go back to the events preceding the deadly virus that wipes out most of humanity. They want him to go back and gather information on a group of radicals known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys; perhaps bring back a sample of the virus in its original form before it mutated. Thus Cole goes through quite an odyssey bouncing back and forth through time to connect the dots.<br/><br/>﻿﻿The film co-stars Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt who along with Willis bring their incredible acting abilities to the table. Much hubbub has been made about Pitts performance as the comically deranged Jeffrey Goines and by all means he certainly deserved his supporting actor nomination. However Willis's frailty and uneasy confusion is a real sight to see when you consider that no one besides Gilliam and M. Night Shymalans has thought to put him in anything other than pulpy action thrillers. His character is our assumed surrogate for our feelings and as his mind slowly breaks apart before us we start to mistrust his judgment and even his sanity. They say that the insane don't know they're insane. From their perspective everything they see or do is rational and normal. But in Cole's case, he looses his grip on reality when he declares himself insane. <br/><br/>By the midpoint of the film Madeleine Stowe's character psychologist Kathryn Railly becomes our sympathetic inference but near the end we even start to lose her in the ether. Insanity is a very relative term and while giving its audience a very stylistic yet conceivable image of apocalypse, Twelve Monkeys forces us not only to question the rational of the characters but our own sanity as well. It's a theme that director Terry Gilliam has explored in nearly all of his films, the nature of insanity within our society. While his earlier films such as Time Bandits (1981) and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) had a much more hopeful viewpoint on delusion, his later films, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Tideland (2005) and Twelve Monkeys are much more fatalistic.<br/><br/>Fatalistic yet brilliantly envisaged. For like Gilliam's magnum opus Brazil (1985), Twelve Monkeys can be interpreted in multiple ways. In the film, Cole speaks while watching Vertigo (1958), ""The movie never changes, it can't change but every time you see it, it seems different because you're different."" During test screenings, Twelve Monkeys got mixed marks echoing Cole's sentiment. Is Twelve Monkeys an easily defined genre movie? No. Can it be seen as a time-travel picture? No. Can I conclusively confirm the film is about insanity at all? No. Yet it works and works well.<br/><br/>I close my review with part of a Persian poem that I think captures the depth and enigmatical aura of Terry Gilliam's triumph:<br/><br/>Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; To-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair: Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why: Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where. -74th Quatrain of the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

"saytosandeep","8","1","1","9 September 2013"," MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Mystery
","Don't go by the title, it's not about animals. It's a pure science fiction based on the concept of time travel. The idea here is complex and even execution does not try to make it simpler for you. You need to provide your full attention to it in order to understand the sequence of events and correlate them to unsolve the mystery. The lead actors Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe play their part with perfection but it is Brad Pitt who steals the show with his portrayal of a maniac. The screenplay is water tight and background score is first-rate. There are lots of interesting conversations over understanding of human psyche. You would not like to miss it if time travel fantasies intrigue you."
"estebangonzalez10","7","1","1","14 August 2013"," The Army of the Twelve Monkeys
","""I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?""<br/><br/>That is the question that the audience has to ask itself during this sci-fi mentally ill time traveling futuristic movie. Is the lead character mentally ill or is he really on a mission traveling through time in order to find a cure to a deadly virus that has wiped off nearly all the population and forced the few survivors to live underground? Director Terry Gilliam has created a memorable sci-fi flick that like all time traveling films has a few in-congruencies but still manages to hold the audience's attention. Gilliam is better known for his work in Monty Python, but he's also directed different types of genre films like The Fisher King (dramedy), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (adventure), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (Fantasy). He has a pretty respectable filmography as a director, although I still think he did his best work in the 90's. This film has a strong screenplay, but it will be remembered for the strong performances from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Twelve Monkeys is a dark futuristic film similar in some ways to Blade Runner although it kind of diverges all over the place with so many ideas. This is an inventive film but I don't know how many ideas were taken from Chris Marker's 1962 short film, La jetee, which inspired this movie. The screenplay was adapted by David Webb Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) and Janet Peoples. His influence from Blade Runner seems to be mixed in the screenplay here as well. This is a very fun sci-fi film although full of really weird moments.<br/><br/>The film takes place sometime in the future after a deadly virus wiped out over 5 billion people and the few survivors were forced to live underground. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a convict who is sent by a group of scientists to the past in order to gather information about the virus. The scientists want to study the virus so they can create a cure and live in the outside world once again. Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 instead of 1996 which was the year in which the virus began spreading, and he ends up in a mental hospital after attacking several police officers. At the mental hospital he is treated by Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and he also meets another patient named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who happens to be the son of a famous scientist (Christopher Plummer). Cole at first begins to search desperately for the ""Army of the Twelve Monkeys"" because they are believed to be the group responsible for spreading the virus, but later he begins to question himself and believe that he might actually be insane himself. This is a puzzle that he will have to piece together with the help of Railly. <br/><br/>This is the puzzle that Gilliam invites the audience to solve along the way and keeps us guessing as the plot unfolds before our eyes. I'm not a huge fan of futuristic films, but Gilliam's vision here is pretty hypnotic and poetic. Most of the film actually takes place in the past, but there are several elements introduced that keep us guessing what will happen next. There were a few stand out scenes like the one in which Cole and Railly are at a movie theater and begin commenting on how despite having seen the movie before the perception of it changes every time, similar to what is happening with Cole through his time traveling. Does his presence in the past change things in the future? Can he find the virus on time in order to save the people in the future? These are a few questions that the film raises. The more you think about things the more flaws you will find, but that doesn't take away anything from this sci-fi film. I really liked Brad Pitt's performance here for which he received an Academy nomination, although he lost to Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects). The film runs a bit long, but it never ceases to entertain.<br/><br/>Rating: 7,1/10"
"Burnedmyguitar","Null","1","1","5 August 2013"," Is he mad or are we? - Director Terry Gilliam
","This film continues an ongoing thread of discussion in film history, about the subjective nature of memories and how they effect the perception of reality. It wears its specific references on its sleeves (and rightfully so): in the opening credits it says inspired by ""La Jetèe"" (1962) and later on the main characters literally watches ""Vertigo"" (1958) in a movie theater. The scene in ""Vertigo"" where they count the rings on the redwood tree align these films closest touching points, and reveal the overall story structure because they all exist in each of the three films. This is one of the most relevant use of a reference in any film I can think of, where we who have a memory of all three films, replicate in our minds the effect felt by the main characters in all three films - especially this one. A brilliant trick which evoke the memory of ""Vertigo"" and ""La Jetèe"" in the viewers mind, and thereby plant a memory just like in the mind of the main characters of these films. A memory which reflects the use of memory in the film, a memory encompassing a whole life of memories, from a young kid until his death. A memory of this film where we know the start (because the scene takes place in the third act) and with the reference we know the ending, but we still don't know how we're getting there.<br/><br/>This film cleverly exist in a vortex in between these other two films, drawing a references here and there into its core which create a new jumbling but cohesive meaning. The result is presented from a subjective point of view, where the explanation of why and how exist in the other films. The other two films explained more thoroughly the overall story, the bigger picture, while this is the experience of the subjective journey at the center of its swirling madness. <br/><br/>I can go on and on about the references to Hitchcock and the history of the subject, but it wouldn't tell you anything about whether the film succeeds in its mission and also, I'm sure you can find a better analysis elsewhere on the internet. :)<br/><br/>A film doesn't have to be a complete original to be great, even remakes can be better than the original films, it just have to be great within its own framework. A theme which this film wants to confuse and confront the viewer with is madness, and what it is in humans and societies. And I feel it fall short in this aspect of the story compared to that of the subject of memories. It compares the madness of the majority (e.g. the twelve monkey's army)and the individual (e.g. Dr. Peters), as well as who we lock up and don't, in a muddled way which for me is one of the things that drags the overall rating down by a margin.<br/><br/>Why I don't necessary think this film reaches the same level of greatness as the other two films mentioned, could have something to do with that this film wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the other films. It's a very good film that stands on its own legs, but it still needs the support from the other films holding each of its hands to remain upright and it still doesn't stand as tall as the others. It gives the subject a fresh perspective but not a new one, and never really starts taking its first wobbling steps towards a life of its own in that territory."

Very good and ingenious production design as usual with Gilliam, but in 12 Monkeys he also managed to keep everything under perfect control - he's a bit of a hit-and-miss director in my opinion.<br/><br/>The mystery part works well, the different scenes in different times all fitting together like cogs in a well-oiled gearbox.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, even if the re watch-value is not that high (knowing about all the twists takes away some of the fun, still rewatchable for the great performances). What keeps this from 10/10 for me is the ultimately depressing story."

Twelve Monkeys succeed most in a field that many others fail, there is a script that is on the verge of perfection and a story perfectly developed. We travel between future and paste, real and surreal, and everything is well balanced and makes sense. The conclusion makes this one of the best time travel movies ever made, but don't get me wrong, this is not one of those movies specifically about time travel. Every time I watch Twelve Monkeys I get a higher concept of it, and it has become a classic to me. 9,5/10"

","As I saw this movie the first time it was just amazing. The different settings and story lines and also the acting was very appreciate. In my opinion it was one of Bruce Willis' best performances, Brad Pitt was also good in his role, he proved that he can play more difficult roles. In Se7en which was published the same year he did also a very good performance but his role in that movie was not so sophisticated.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys may be Terry Gilliam's best movie, among Brazil which has also this kind of ""Terry Gilliam Fantasy"". But in a nutshell it is very difficult to describe that movie without spoilers. But in common the plot is that James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back from the year 2035 into 1996 to stop a pandemic that will cause the death of millions of people in the next two years. But now I have to stop because now the spoiler alert is alarming. But nevertheless you have to pay attention in every part of that movie.<br/><br/>The only point that makes the movie not a masterpiece is that the role and the acting of Madeleine Stowe in this movie is not very convincing or interesting. But yet every single character is important for the movie. So pay attention and you will experience a nearly perfect movie. Maybe Terry Gilliam's next movies can spread that ""Terry Gilliam Fantasy"" of Twelve Monkeys."

","Without a doubt one of Gilliam finest moments. A perfect vehicle for him, although he did not write it himself. He manages to inject it with his own trademark quirkiness and idiosyncrasies without losing focus, as he have done in the past. Here he has, as in Fisher King, a strong script to work from. He is utterly unlike any other director out there, balancing the melancholy drama and black comedy elements with great skill. I remember being blown away by the first scene with Brad, what a total transformation! I hardly recognized him, and to be able to do what he does here is a sign of a serious hard-working actor. The intricate story lends itself well to multiple viewings, and I have returned to this film many times since 1996, and I probably will continue to do so. The score is also remarkably original for a Hollywood production. At first Piazollas accordion may seem to be a too bold a move, but it soon becomes clear that it works beautifully. The rest of Paul Buckmasters score is also right on the money. Now I would love to see Gilliam adapt something by Philip K. Dick.

"jamiecostelo58","9","1","1","18 December 2006"," Masterpiece
","Twelve Monkeys will go down as a true classic. It's the story of power and subsequent death, told in a superbly directed manner. A welcome change for Bruce Willis, a seemingly weak mannered Cole, who cannot change the fact the universe will come to an end, and cannot change the fact of time no matter how hard his attempts are. Terry Gilliam brings us a detailed analysis of the balance of power (or Cole's lack of it) to chilling effect, along with an equally strong ending, which may make us believe what really is 'sane'.<br/><br/>I loved this movie upon first viewing and I still do. Willis proves himself an actor of all genres, not just your typical action hero as proved with the Die Hard films, but also as a vulnerable and weak individual who tries to do whatever he must to save and help others, but simply cannot because of his own severe issues, such as his performance in the excellent Sixth Sense as well as Tweleve Monkeys. A terrific nail-biting film. 9/10"

Brad Pitt was also good as a maniacal scientist.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best Sci fi movies out there and from my side, I highly recommend, but pay close attention because this is a movie in which every single scene is connected to another.<br/><br/>Overall, twelve monkeys is a very good movie that is something different and the director does a good job in pulling it off. It thoroughly deserves it's place on the IMDb top 250."

","Why waste time and write a comment on an old science fiction movie of the nineties? The special effects are executed so much better nowadays, aren't they?<br/><br/>Number one: You don't even have to accept this movie as Science Fiction. The story is told as if we were witnessing the main character (Bruce Willis) losing grip of reality, as if everything we see might only exist in his mind. Movies sort of only exist in our mind, by the way. <br/><br/>Number two and all the way to number twelve: I don't believe Terry Gilliam will ever top this: It's not just his best movie, It's an all time instant classic, with a terrific script and a stellar cast.<br/><br/>Disconnection and misinterpretation are key words in this feverish update of the H. G. Wells classic ""The Time Machine"". But in Gilliams deconstructed version, the Sci-Fi technology is reduced to visual madness, and human life is reduced to fear of contact, both inward and outward in life. Everybody's in cages, and when they try to break loose or are set free, they just become even more disconnected and visually surreal. Every time you try to loosen the knot, it turns out you're just tightening it.<br/><br/>It won't take you long to realize that this movie unfolds like a classic tragedy. But the story will keep twisting and turning long after you've finished watching the movie. To me, that's as good as it gets, if you decide to waste some of your precious limited time on earth at watching movies - without the possibility of escaping by time machine to the nearest banana outlet or whatever you fancy in life."
"johnshinnick","10","1","1","16 October 2005"," A post-pandemic psychological pretzel starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt.
","This is one of my favorite movies. I saw it on the big screen twice and about 50 times on DVD. Each time, my appreciation for the script, editing, direction and acting continues to grow. <br/><br/>It is an amazing drama, rich in layers and dark humor.<br/><br/>On the big screen, the story was so overlaid with complexity that I missed it entirely. I went back the second time to find clues to the storyline. The post-apocalyptic vision and Cole's psychological conundrum are so entwined with time travel that the story cannot be evident on the first viewing. It helps to enter the world a few times to wear the skin of the main character.<br/><br/>Gilliam has undertaken to tell an amazing story, but he asks his viewer to be a partner in the telling. His Monty Python sketches were that way, too, with the humor lying somewhere beneath the surface, inviting you to go down the rabbit hole with Alice. <br/><br/>On the big screen, I was entertained by Brad Pitt, who is sometimes hilarious, but his antics caused me to overlook Bruce Willis, who plays the perfectly sane straight man forced to question his own sanity in a perplexing situation. Even without the problem of a world-killing pandemic, all of us should be able to identify with the problem of the central character. James Cole's psychological overlay adds a lot to the telling of the story. <br/><br/>In lesser hands, 12 Monkeys dystopian vision would be just another piece of pulp science fiction. The psychological dimension enriches the deeper mysteries and gives the film ""legs.""<br/><br/>Today's headlines warn of an impending world-wide pandemic. England is preparing for 50,000 fatalities, and most other countries are groping for some way to head off a major world-wide catastrophe. In light of our reality, 12 Monkeys' post- apocalyptic vision strikes a cord each time I see it. <br/><br/>If we are tiptoeing along a similar precipice, we should get it right... we don't have the luxury of time travel to fix the problem."
"lee_eisenberg","8","1","1","21 September 2005"," Could this really happen?
","Usually, we expect Bruce Willis to only act in the stupidest kinds of movies, but he does a different kind of role here in ""Twelve Monkeys"". Sometime in the future, a virus has wiped out much of the human population. There are some convicts locked up in a facility, including James Cole (Bruce Willis). Cole is hired to go back in time to find the cause of the virus. But several unexpected things happen in the course of his adventure back in time. Things which may or may not bring him closer to the truth than he realizes.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam, always one for the bizarre, created something really interesting here. More than simply a ""disease story"", ""Twelve Monkeys"" looks at the virus from the future, giving one a tingly feeling. Good support from Madeleine Stowe as Kathryn Railly, trying to help Cole find out what caused the virus, and Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines, who may or may not be associated with the virus. Not like any movie that you've ever seen."
"mentalcritic","9","1","1","15 July 2005"," Terry Gilliam's other masterpiece
","Terry Gilliam excels at portraying a world gone mad. That much is clear from a single viewing of either 12 Monkeys or Brazil. What 12 Monkeys has that Brazil does not is a little more experience and expertise. By contrasting the maddest kind of future with an equally mad past, Gilliam creates a nightmarish science fiction world where contrast is the meat in one very odd sandwich. For Gilliam, it is one of many masterpieces. For lead actors Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, it was the turning point in careers of varying prestige. Although Pitt had yet to truly make a splash as the darker half of a strange personality in Fight Club, Willis had literally turned portraying the vulnerable, less than superhuman hero into an art form some seven years previous in Die Hard. Both have since gone onto bigger, although not necessarily better, things. Willis is asking the sky for a fourth Die Hard film, and Pitt made no less than twenty million dollars for his most recent film. Neither of them could have achieved that without this film.<br/><br/>What makes 12 Monkeys especially stand out in their careers is that it refuses to follow a conventional storyline. While it does have the tragic heroine thing all through the main story, it evolves in a manner rarely seen in Hollywood. Madeleine Stowe proves herself in a role that must have taken quite a toll on her physically and emotionally. Her disbelief at the start of the film and her growing sense of belief in Willis' story towards the end is very palpable. Brad Pitt manages to feign a kind of insanity in a very convincing manner. The moment where he feigns being cross-eyed as he enters a room is frightening. But the real star of this show is the story, which links together fragments from alternating periods of both the past (our past, that is) and the future in a manner that gives the film a great sense of economy. There is nothing redundant in 12 Monkeys, just a plot that leaves the viewer gobsmacked at the end.<br/><br/>If there is a weakness in 12 Monkeys, it is in the scenes of the future. Borrowing heavily from the playbook he used in Brazil, Gilliam builds a future where scientists coerce cooperation from prisoners, often by drowning them in visual and audio stimulus. I doubt that Gilliam's intent was to paint scientists as a cruel, evil mob. Perhaps he tried to contrast the scientists with Stowe's compassionate doctor, but the Monty Python-style acting of the future scientists does get on the nerves. Christopher Meloni sticks his head in as a police lieutenant who delivers one of the best gags in the film. It is the one that, in fact, makes a convert out of Stowe's character. This way of linking the past with the future as her character spraypaints a message onto a wall as Pitt spouts out a theory about how she could know what he is up to becomes one of the classic moments in cinema. I will not speak of the film's ending, but when you see it, you will be amazed by the continuity links. This is one tightly put-together film.<br/><br/>Paul Buckmaster creates an original, timeless score that punctuates the wild mood swings Willis' character endures. As Willis acts out the questioning of his own sanity, a desire to be what he calls ""well"", and eventually his acceptance of a patently impossible situation, Buckmaster's score delivers a suitably downbeat punctuation. The music is part of what makes the misery of the situation so tangible. As Willis recites the last half of Stowe's message to the future, the music turns the action into a ghost story. The real kicker is the string and accordion theme when the army of the Twelve Monkeys appears perfectly conveys the sheer nuttiness of its leader. Many of the people who have changed our world, for better or worse, were very much mentally divergent, as the film puts it. Einstein, for example, is believed to have been a sufferer of Asperger's Syndrome. Pitt's character, a real sod by the name of Jeffrey Goines, will never be as loved as Einstein, but Pitt does manage to inject some Einsteinian quirks into the character. In spite of the fact that 1996 is now the past, the scenario depicted seems more believable than ever.<br/><br/>I gave 12 Monkeys a nine out of ten. I am still in two minds as to whether it or Brazil is Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. Either way, it is worthy of watching at least once. If you enjoy science fiction without the need for an uplifting message, then this film has a good chance with you."
"YesterdaysJam","9","1","1","26 January 2003"," Visually stunning
","A post-apocalyptic future gets the ""Gilliam"" treatment - and it's visually stunning! But is this future real ? - or is it the psychotic imagining of mental patient, James Cole (Bruce Willis). That is one of the delightful conundrums of the film, and it is not resolved until near the end (it IS resolved, despite some idiotic postings on IMDB suggesting otherwise).<br/><br/>Don't dismiss the film simply because of Bruce Willis' name on the cast list - he is far less annoying in this film than in every other film that I've seen him in. Likewise, Brad Pitt's atypical role is thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>Even after many viewings (about 7 in my case), the themes of madness and fate, and the `monkey' motif stand up strongly. One of my favourites."

"Dark Eye","9","1","1","24 December 2002"," One clever movie
","Quite an impressive work by Terry Gilliam, and that's a nice change after all the mind-twisting numbness of Brazil.<br/><br/>12 Monkeys has a brilliantly constructed plot about the destruction of mankind by a virus, but I won't go into the plot details here. Bruce Willis gave one of the best performances in his life, but I don't agree with the majority of people about Brad Pitt's acting. He is quite distracting and a bit exaggerated, but obviously he's having a time of his life playing a nutty character.<br/><br/>The best moment is when the character is in the theatre, feeling a sense of deja vu, that he is somewhat re-living a phase of his memory. That scene became genuinely creepy when Hitchcock's Vertigo is playing in the background.<br/><br/>For those of you who struggled with Brazil (watched it several times already) 12 Monkeys is more fun and comprehensible, but by no means I'm suggesting that the movie itself is simple-minded. If there is any criticism, I'll say that the ending is just isn't satisfying enough. After all the twists and thrill, one would expect an equally, if not more, startling ending. But it ended in a way like someone has walked around in a circle.<br/><br/>Highly recommended viewing!"

The plot is excellent; it succeeds in involving the audience in the post-apocalyptic experience.

"JamesKLambert","10","1","1","26 November 1999"," Close to a perfect movie
","I usually call 12 Monkeys my favorite film, because I like the idea of time travel, but hate so much of how I have seen it done.  I can easily see this film becoming a cult classic and/or being widely talked about as sadly `overlooked.'  Though I am quite aware that the film is not for all tastes, I do not see how any lover of cinema could call this a bad film.  Like a fine meal, how can you not appreciate the preparations that went into it, even if you do not have the pallet for it?  I have never seen another time travel movie that is so well thought out, were everything ties together in a perfect circle, and there are so many details and insights to discover/change/question upon further viewing.<br/><br/>Most of the criticism I have seen of 12 Monkeys seems to be based on taste or on insults and name calling without substance.  If it is simple personal preference I can understand that, but when they say it is lacking in its plot, camera work, acting, etc., that leads me to believe that many people simply do not understand it, or they have some jealous chip on their shoulders against big name stars.  I remember seeing 12 Monkeys in the theater, and as the credits rolled two people behind me were talking over what happened.  The first said they did not understand, so the second proceeded to explain the ending, though it was obvious that she too was not getting it.  I know it sounds pretentious, but it takes a level of sophistication that I do not think most casual movie watchers have.  In many ways I think this film does for time travel what 2001 did for space movies: It tries to think through every detail more completely.<br/><br/>WARRING!  SPOILERS ENCLOSED FROM HERE ON:<br/><br/>And the last line of the film is so wonderfully delivered to give a double meaning and a ray of hope  I think the only last words I like more are from A Touch Of Evil.  But once again that's just a personal feeling.<br/><br/>
As for the often-overrated La Jetee, that some people think should not have been `remade,' it is a visually stunning and poetic film.  But La Jetee lacks the well thought out fullness and development that 12 Monkeys brings to the story, and I therefore would not call this a remake (the credits say it is `inspired by,' which is more correct).  My biggest problem with La Jetee is that it is not great science fiction, it is an intellectual cop out and could be better labeled as `fantasy.'  In La Jetee a man from the near future is chosen to go back into the past to get items necessary for human survival after a nuclear war.  He is selected because of his strong memories and obsessive dreams about the past.  The scientists are able to amplify these dreams in a way that allows him to enter the past.  It is far fetched, but those are the rule it sets up and I as the viewer was willing to accept them.  The plot problem comes in when they decide to send him into the far future.  How is this possible?  He has no memories of the future for the scientists to latch onto.  The film breaks its own scientific reasoning, which breaks my suspension of disbelieve, and tells me that the writer got sloppy.  Worse, the idea of going into the far future, because if they are there they must have found a way to survive, therefore they can save us so they can be born, is so much illogical nonsense as to be childish.  This is a clear sign of writer's block.  La Jetee got its hero into a situation that it did not know how to get out of, so it decides to call on the hand of God (the far future people) to solve the problem.  Whenever you introduce previously unknown and all-powerful characters late in the story it is an obvious script failure.  This offers no opportunity for your character to grow, to sink or swim on their own, and leaves the audience feeling gypped. Hamlet should regain his father's kingdom or bring down everyone around him in his maddening quest  you don't have the Virgin Mary suddenly appear, give him back his sanity, and put him on the throne.  It's just not good writing.  12 Monkeys corrects La Jetee's error by never going into the far future, while also added more details that pull everything together in a more intelligent manor.  In La Jetee the main character's actions has nothing to do with the nuclear war, but the main character's actions in 12 Monkeys are an integral part of the virus that almost wipes out the human race.  This is a far superior plot.<br/><br/>I fear that what most `high-minded' people are judging La Jetee on is the fact that it is French.  Just as many Americans would never see a foreign film, other Americans would never dare believe that Hollywood could ever do anything right.  You can see the obvious slant one way or the other in so many reviews of 12 Monkeys, La Jetee, and other films.  But the fatal flaw of La Jetee can not be wiped clean just because it is big in `artistic' circles.  It was a wonderful idea that was later improved upon."

","The time travel plot is insipid. There are two tiny bits of inspiration --the mental confusion resulting from an arbitrary ""present"" and the calm acceptance of being unable to change the past-- but they don't amount to much. And of course, if you can't change the past it doesn't matter what the time travelers do, so that makes any suspense silly. The director's grotesqueries don't resonate with me; I like weirdness (Twin Peaks) but just having ugly people do odd stuff is not profound. The last 15 minutes of the film took an eternity to end, and didn't mean a damn thing. I know life is pointless, but I want a movie to distract me from that for awhile. The characters were not involving. Another thing I did like was the tentativeness of the romance. The fumbled kisses and embraces were well done."

","On the upside, ""Twelve Monkeys"" pulls together a solid cast, a sort of Mad Max extrapolation milieu with lots of Rube Goldberg contraptions, a story which kinda/sorta makes sense, and weirdness heaped upon weirdness not to mention glowing reviews from critics and the public alike. On the downside, the flick tries too hard to be weird with tweaked color, tilts and angles, short lens closeups, fog, etc. and bunches of bizarre characters. A good flick for sci-fi junkies and people into weirdness for weirdnesses sake. Just be sure to turn off your brain before viewing to avoid numerous plot holes."

"Krippler","7","2","4","26 May 2004"," Good, but not ""Top 250"" good.
","I mean really, is ""12 Monkeys"" one of the top 200 movies ever? I do agree that Terry Gilliam is one of the greatest directors, of the last 30 years, at giving the viewer wonderful things to look at on the screen. I think, however, that this film proves that he has some trouble connecting these fantastic images with a truly gripping narrative. ""12 Monkeys"" has some moments, mainly where the plot twists appear, that are riveting. These moments, combined with the magnificent scenes which take place in the future, almost make the police chase scenes and the seemingly endless scenes where Bruce Willis' character beats people up, fly out of all memory. But they don't. Throughout the film, just as Gilliam gives us something mindblowing, he stoops to the level of a dopey scene where a detective lectures ""Dr. Railly"" on the dangers of defending her kidnapper, or a scene where the pimp accuses the lady of ""working his turf"" and then gets beaten up. I do like this movie, I just feel that to be one of the top 250 films out of the thousands and thousands of films ever made, it better be close to perfect. ""12 Monkeys"" is a very entertaining film and the cinematography deserved at least an Oscar nomination, but it is not even Gilliam's best film, much less ""Top 250"" material.<br/><br/>7 out 10"

This film is an experience for all senses.<br/><br/>The story goes that humanity has pretty much gone underground in the future, after an event known as the Army of 12 Monkeys happened and wiped out most of us with a virus. Both now some of our remaining scientists have cracked time travel and are about to send a man into the past to find a cure for this virus. The man chosen for this is a convict named James Cole, brilliantly played by Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>12 Monkeys has a well-earned reputation as one of the better time travel movies out there. And for a good reason. To explain exactly why would involve heavy spoilers, but suffice to say that I really admire the cohesion the film has in regards to the time travel paradox. The ending is a beauty.<br/><br/>Plus, it's a crazy-looking blast of oddball characters, highly memorable conversations, great acting moments and it's also a decent enough love story. After a fashion.<br/><br/>Great movie. Surprisingly easy to follow, given that it was directed by Gilliam and involves heavy time travel elements, but it is what it is.

It's an incredibly entertaining ride, one that leaves you guessing until the very end. There were two very big things that happened at the end.

"ccunning-73587","7","0","0","20 September 2019"," An outstanding job of acting by both Willis and Pitt!
","I found this movie interesting and entertaining. Synopsis: The movie setting is in 4 different times, 1916, 1990, 1996, and an undetermined future date. As the movie frequently flips back and forth between the different dates some may be challenged by or dislike the hard to follow instantaneously changing time confusion... I believe that you can see that this movie is one part 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and two parts 'Terminator'. A virus kills 99% of mankind in 1996 and the remaining 1% lives underground to avoid the deadly virus. Bruce Willis is a convicted criminal in a future time where scientists have developed the ability to travel back in time (Though not an exact science...). Willis 'volunteers' to go back in time to help scientists obtain an unmutated strain of the virus to try to develop a way to counter the virus so man can return to the surface of the earth. A technical glitch sends Willis back to 1990, not 1996 as planned, and with his limited interpersonal skills sets is deemed 'crazy' by authorities in 1990 and they put him in a 'nut house' where he meets Pitt, who is truly crazy. Eventually Willis does get to 1996 where he tries to stop Pit and some other liberal environmentalists from releasing the virus but... (I won't spoil it for you!) An outstanding job of acting by both Willis and Pitt!"

","Absolutely surreal, utterly bleak and one of the best time travel movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>When it comes to the story's performance, Brad Pitt's character, Jeffrey, is a standout performance for his expressions and body language - the little inflections and facial movement in his delivery really emphasise the insanity of his character while working as a brilliant red herring for who caused the viral outbreak that decimated the population of the earth as it's revealed that it wasn't the titular 12 Monkeys that caused it, but instead the assistant of Jeffrey's father, a virologist, and the story unfolds in such a manner that you realise that the main character, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is part of a closed 'causal loop' with his actions leading to the viral outbreak happening in the first place. And despite its many twists and turns, the plot somehow never gets overly convoluted or confusing. Also, the romance subplot between Cole and his psychiatrist, Dr. Railly, is surprisingly believable and touching. The neo-noir/steampunk-esque set design and props are also gorgeously created and showcased through the film's (mostly) excellent shot composition, like the strange 'eyeball' contraption that observes Cole in the scientist's room or the dilapidated underground area shown in the opening credits sequence. However, as you might guess from the phrase ""(mostly) excellent"", I didn't think the cinematography was perfect. Mainly it's because I felt that the use of dutch angles was overused. I get that the atmosphere of the film is uneasy and the 'dutches' reflect that, but at the same time, I definitely think it could have been toned down significantly through more varied camera positioning and blocking.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10; maybe high 8 or lower, somewhere around there."

","The more I explore certain directors, the more I realize that many of them are only really trying to grapple with one or two themes over and over again in different settings. This is definitely how I feel about Terry Gilliam. It won't come as a shock to any of my readers that ""12 Monkeys"" deals with themes of sanity/insanity, reality, fantasy, identity, resistance of authority and cultural manipulations, destiny, and legend. You could say the same about ""Brazil,"" ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,"" or ""The Fisher King.""<br/><br/>What makes ""12 Monkeys"" a lesser-Gilliam-film is that it doesn't do those things as well, with as much dear characterization, or tongue in cheek darkness as his other films. Bruce Willis' (""The Sixth Sense"") James Cole isn't an especially interesting character as he is more of a puzzler than an actor. He mostly just thinks about the army of the twelve monkey and how he might stop them from carrying out a dastardly plan that sends humanity to the brink of extinction but at the end of the day I don't really care about him that much. His journey doesn't move me. In a film that is about exploring the edges of our protagonists reality and sanity that is a huge problem.<br/><br/>Enough about the things that don't work. This is Gilliam so the fun is in what does. The production design, as always, is top notch. Even though much of the film takes place in ""the normal world"" Gilliam is able to draw out the extreme nature of the mind jam that Cole is in by creating the extreme environments he interacts within. The asylum, the 1 2 Twelve Monkeys HQ, and the airport are all hyper realities that blend with the future underground world in tone. This is needed to keep the illusion that either world could be true or both or neither. If one looks and feels remarkably different than the other then it seems to be a clear delineation between reality and falsehood.<br/><br/>Gilliam is the master of this. He makes the insane seem real and the truth seem incredible. He blends them in a way few directors are capable of, using exactly the elements which another film would see as too extreme as the subtle hints to the audience that the entire world is insane.<br/><br/>When I say that this is a lesser-Gilliam film, I don't mean that I think that or even that it isn't very popular. It is a highly rated film but I think that is mainly because of his films, ""12 Monkeys"" is far more accessible and therefore, says less and says it with less deft sleight of hand and nebulous morality than his other films. The very thing that makes it more in the eyes of many is what make it less in the eyes of others."

","Tonight I watched this 1995 Terry Gilliam sci-fi film, which stars Bruce Willis who plays James Cole, Madeleine Stowe whom plays a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly, Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines, and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Leland Goines, to name the main characters. Cole, a prisoner in a compound in Philadelphia in 2035, living underground like the rest of humanity which was not killed by a virus. He is tasked by a group of scientists of traveling back in time to find the origin of a virus which is traced to a group called the 12 Monkeys.<br/><br/>The first time he travels back is to 1990 (due to scientist error), but he is confined to a mental hospital in Baltimore, meeting Kathryn Railly, and Jeffrey Goines. Not obtaining the information needed, he is whisked back to his present (our future), scolded for not obtaining what is necessary. So he gets a second chance, accidentally traveling to a WWI battlefield in 1917, then traveling to 1996. When there he literally kidnaps Kathryn, and they drive to Philadelphia to find more information about the 12 Monkeys. He then convinces the scientists to let him travel to 1996 again, in part because he wants be with Kathryn, whom has become fond of him. While there he wants to turn himself into the police but Kathryn doesn't let him. He then takes out his teeth to stop the scientists from tracking him. Soon Kathryn buys whigs and disguises for each of them, with them looking like the recurring dream he has.<br/><br/>On the way to the airport to take a plane to Key West, it is clear the the 12 Monkeys are just ""wannabe revolutionaries"" as he calls it. Instead they want to release animals from cages, Dr. Peters (played by David Morse) is clearly the one who releases the virus to the world. Cole tells this to the scientists of the present (our future) and is given a gun by his fellow prisoner to shoot someone, although it is not clear whom. But as he runs to kill the renegade doctor he is shot by police and fire in the arms of Kathryn. Watching this unfold is apparently a young James who witnesses perversely, the scene of his own death. With that and the virus spreading across the world, the film ends, sitting near a scientist of the future (Cole's present), Jones.<br/><br/>This raises so, so many questions. For one, are the scientists of the future/present complicit in the spread of the virus. If so, that is deeply disturbing. Additionally, while I would say that it is extremely probable he traveled to the past, 80-90% probability this was the case. However, there is a 10-20% chance his ""time travel"" experience was actually just a cruel experiment by scientists. In the end, I think other time travel movies I watched were much better but I would rate this a 8 out of 10 as it has some promise, although it is a bit depressing as it implies that the future is already written and cannot be changed, a bit like the conception in The Time Traveler's Wife (2009)."

Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis. The man has a natural charisma that helps him sell any role hes in without having to stray from his natural behavior too much, and this film is no different. The real highlight of this film is Brad Pitt and his complete transformation into a total nut job, which is very convincing. I suspect method acting with how pinpoint his mannerisms and speech patterns are, awesome job on his part. As far as the story goes, the majority of the film is nothing to amazing, it gets you from act to act keeping you interested but never doing anything to really peak your interest or suck you in further. However once Madeline Stowe's character has her arc I would say is where the film really picks up, and the last half hour or so are full of twists and turns that keep you glued to the screen untill the climax and the films eventual conclusion. From a technical aspect, I have no issues really. Film looks good, directed well, sounds good, all the little things that are overlooked by your average movie viewer. Replay value is moderate I would say, just because there are sci-fi movies out there that are much more ""fun"" so I'm thinking this movie gets lost in the rotation. Overall 12 monkeys is a solid watch, keeping you interested until its enthralling last 30 min, but the fact that it is much more a drama with a sci-fi setting will ultimatley cause it to remain largely on the shelf. 8.2/10"

","I can barely remember the first time I watched TWELVE MONKEYS. I remember enjoying it and thinking it was an interesting film but it wasn't something that I felt the need to revisit any time soon. It's odd how there are movies that you watch at one period in your life and see it one way but when watched later feel like a completely different film. This time around I totally enjoyed the film and the performances, appreciating them far more than I did the first time.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is James Cole, a prisoner in a bleak future where most of humanity has been wiped out by a virus years prior. What is left is gathered beneath the surface where animals have now reclaimed what was left. In the hopes of preventing the devastation that took place scientists are sending agents back in time to gather information in the hopes of pinpointing exactly when the release of the virus took place. Cole is one of those agents, a prisoner with a complete pardon set in place should he succeed.<br/><br/>But the process of time travel isn't quite as precise as they would hope it to be. His first foray into the past lands him 6 years earlier than intended. Found on the streets he's arrested and taken to a mental institution for examination. His violent outburst result in his being given meds to calm him down. His memories are scrambled and while he has some idea of what he has to do the combination of that and the drugs he's been given make things cloudy at best.<br/><br/>Cole becomes the patient of Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) who feels like she's met him before. Once in the ward's open room he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), a completely insane patient who befriends him. The son of a wealthy geneticist, Goines raves on about various items and tells Cole he'll help him escape. He follows through on his promise but Cole is caught and locked in a cell. When they return to talk to him he has vanished. In reality he's returned to the future.<br/><br/>Cole is sent back once again and bounces around time, first to WWI and then to where he needs to be in 1996. He finds Railly, kidnaps her and then learns that Jeffrey is now out of the hospital and working for his father. More investigating leads the couple to an anarchist group who once worked with Jeffrey and they direct him towards his father.<br/><br/>As they travel in search of clues Railly begins to believe Cole's story. Even more so when a news item he knew the results of comes true. Hoping to find him once more Railly returns to the small group where she finds Cole once more returned from the future, now convinced he was hallucinating. She assures him he wasn't and the two then set off to complete his mission.<br/><br/>This movie works on so many levels and feels clear and complicated at the same time in various parts of the film. Is Cole merely suffering from delusions or is he really from the future sent back in time to help avert the greatest catastrophe known to man? And if he is who he claims, how does one go about recruiting others like Railly to help him find the information he needs?<br/><br/>Director Terry Gilliam is a master when it comes to all things mechanical in appearance, something noted in his films from THE FISHER KIND to BRAZIL. He applies that look here as well when it comes to scientists in the future and how they handle their subjects. The film definitely has that Gilliam feel and look about it. What is amazing about his films is how he can take such convoluted stories and make them accessible to the normal everyday viewer. In addition to that he makes them entertaining as well.<br/><br/>The performances here offer each actor at the top of their game. Willis has portrayed the chisel jawed hero in the past but here he's vulnerable on several levels. He has no money, no weapon and his mind isn't quite what it needs to be to accomplish his task. Willis plays the role in such a way that you feel sympathy more than anything for his character. Stowe does a great job as well presenting a character who thinks she knows it all suddenly discovering that what she thought she knew could be completely off the mark. But of the three leads it is Pitt who shines the brightest here. The tics, twitches and phraseology he uses as Goines are unique to him and he comes off as completely believable when it comes to being insane. Why he wasn't an Oscar winner is beyond me.<br/><br/>If you've seen the film before but forgotten it then by all means this is the best way to see it again or to check it out for the first time for that matter. Arrow Video is releasing the film in a beautiful new 4K scan of the original negative by Arrow Films, approved by director Terry Gilliam. In addition to that they've once more shown why they are leading the way in the release of classic films like this with plenty of extras to enjoy. Those extras include an audio commentary track by Gilliam and producer Charles Roven, THE HAMSTER FACTORY AND OTHER TALES OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS a feature length making of documentary by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, an extensive image gallery, the theatrical trailer, a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Gary Pullin and for the first pressing only an illustrated collectors booklet featuring new writing on the film by Nathan Rabin and archive material.<br/><br/>Some of you may tire of hearing me rave about Arrow Video but the fact is they are among the best out there at releasing movies in superior formats like this. Along with Vinegar Syndrome and Severin they are saving movies from obscurity as well as hits that have been forgotten and offering them in such a way that they can be enjoyed as if they were new releases between the excellent restorations they've done as well as the extras they include. As long as they continue to release films like this you'll hear me continue to sing their praises. At present that means get used to it because they have a ton of great stuff in the pipeline."

","12 Monkeys is a fine time-travel based sci-fi movie. Its smart and filled with outstanding performances by Bruce Willis as lead and Brad Pitt in supporting role. James Cole(Bruce Willis) gets sent back in time to save humanity from an apocalypse set up by a unknown virus infestation. It begins nicely but soon loses focus. But its Brad Pitt playing a lunatic who saves the day in the asylum where Willis ends up after being sent into the past.This is one of the best performance he has given till date.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is that it generates suspense in the minds of the viewers whether it is time travel or just mind games of Cole.The script is neat focusing on variety of things that happen in this corporate system. Also another positive of the film is the character played by the lovely Madeleine Stowe which is of Cole's psychiatrist. She adds the required charm in this dark time-travel loop. <br/><br/>The ending is marvelous and really fits perfectly for the questions raised by the time-travel in the movie.I would have liked it more if it had developed more interesting thoughts in the middle rather than using the same ideas. Anyways its worth a watch for all sci-fi fans.<br/><br/>RATING: [3.5/5]"
"zardoz-13","10","0","0","17 March 2011"," Another Mind-Blowing Gilliam Extravaganza
","""Brazil"" director Terry Gilliam really goes off on a tangent with ""Twelve Monkeys,"" an apocalyptic science-fiction, time-travel thriller about an individual from the future sent back to the past a la ""The Terminator"" to ascertain the origins of a lethal man-made virus that nearly annihilated mankind. An Orwellian dystopia pervades virtually everything nook and cranny of the world in the year 2035. The survivors of humanity have gone into exile in the bowels of the Earth as a result of a devastating disaster that killed five billion people in 1997, and life is no picnic for them. Unlike most squeaky-clean, futuristic sci-fi sagas, ""Twelve Monkeys"" is anything but sleek, sanitized, and ultra-modern. Instead, life is grungy, and science relies on technology that often malfunctions. Charles Dickens would describe it as 'the worst of times.' Indeed, Gilliam explores many of his favorite trademark themes with ""Blade Runner"" scenarists David and Janet Peoples in this 131-minute, R-rated film. Not only is the line between reality and illusion thin but also it is never straight. Everything that obsessed Gilliam in his epic, landmark opus ""Brazil"" is recycled in ""Twelve Monkeys,"" but delivered in a tone that lacks the whimsy of the former film. Just as he mixed up everything to the verge of incomprehensibility, Gilliam keeps us off balance and out-of-kilter with one surprise after another in a storyline as crooked as a dog's hind leg. For example, our hero is sent into the past three times and two of those times he winds up in the wrong era. <br/><br/>A shaven-headed, abject-looking, but pugnacious Bruce Willis stars as James Cole. (Oh, my God, check out those symbolic initials!) Cole weathers as much flak from the people in from his own time period as he does from the people in the past. Although he embarks on this odyssey as a sane person, he winds up doubting his own insanity by the time he reaches the right time period. The scientists recruited Cole for their scientific voyage in time because he possesses remarkable powers of observation. The scientists themselves look like they are on a weekend pass from the loony bin. Madeleine Stowe plays Dr. Kathryn Railly, a sympathetic psychiatrist from the 20th century who comes to Cole's aid after he is arrested and chained up in a Philadelphia Police station. She gets in committed to a mental institution that makes ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" look like a resort. Predictably, when Cole tries to convince Railly and her provincial labcoated colleagues that he has come from the future, they diagnose him as delusional. During his brief incarceration in the mental ward, Cole runs into a harmless, babbling lunatic played by Brad Pitt in a bravura performance that garnered him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. An animal rights activist, Jeffrey Goines (Pitt) assembles the eponymous army that Cole believes will usher in worldwide chaos and destruction. Incredibly, Jeffrey masterminds Cole's escape from the asylum. Christopher Plummer is cast as famous viral researcher Dr. Leland Goines who happens to be his father. Plummer adopts a magnolia-dripping Southern drawl that Pitt doesn't imitate. Haunting the periphery of this warped, psychological vortex, is Plummer's research assistant David Morse, who has more to do with the outcome that you initially believe because he doesn't garner as much screen-time as his co-stars. Frank Gorshin appears in a supporting role as Railly's superior. Ostensibly, Gilliam drew inspiration for ""Twelve Monkeys"" from the 27-minute, 1962 French New Wave film ""La Jetee."" ""Twelve Monkeys"" isn't an easy movie to understand and its vertiginous plot may leave some viewers baffled as well as frustrated."

","In 2003,I was one night channel surfing,and on one of the channels (the UK Sci-Fi channel)I noticed the channel was showing a short intro,about the first showing on the channel of a film called 12 Monkeys.Intrigued massively,due to how much<br/><br/>the documentary discussed, what seemed to be the many interesting plot threads that feature in the film.Sadly,my brothers were desperate to watch one of their videos at the time,so I did not get a chance to watch the film.<br/><br/>A year later...<br/><br/>I was downstairs with my dad at 1am,and we were trying to find any films that was on,that looked interesting.After seeing that the movie channels were not showing anything,we decided that we would instead watch some comedy shows on the UK Gold channel.When we went on the channel,we found out that instead of showing comedies that night, the channel was showing 12 Monkeys!.<br/><br/>Although the film was at the half-way point,from the very first scene that I saw,where a man-was holding a woman hostage in her own car and telling her to drive to a state that is over 100 miles away.I was gripped from that very moment.<br/><br/>The film grabbed my attention by the throat,in a way that hardly anything I had seen,or read before had.Before viewing the film,almost all of the stories that I had enjoy,had been ones with very simple a- to- b narratives.But in the final hour of this film,I was completely astonished at how amazing well the film was able to hold very complex plot threads,in an unforgettable way.From the moment that the end credits appeared,I knew that I had seen a true modern classic that I would never forget. <br/><br/>The plot-1997: <br/><br/>A virus (that is spread in the air) gets realised that kills 99% of the human race,which causes all of the survivors to go deep underground,as all of the animals start to regain there foothold,in being the dominant species. <br/><br/>2035:<br/><br/>After having failed to figure out what caused the spread of the virus,a group of scientist decide to build a time machine,so that they can send a human to late 1996 to gather information about how the virus got released,so that they can try to start rebuilding humanity.<br/><br/>The selection process to choose a traveller (and to make sure that it is someone that they don't urgently need in the present)is to randomly select a prisoners number.The prisoner selected is James Cole,a man who has been put in prison,due to his violent disorder in the past (although none of the scientist know that for his whole life James has been having the same dream/nightmare of something that has left his subconscious permanently damaged.)With having no choice at all,Cole is told that he is going to be sent to late 1996,to find out about the virus,and to find out about a group named The Army of the 12 Monkeys.As James goes into the machine,he is told that because of how advance the machine is,he will defiantly arrive in 1996.When he wakes up,Cole realises that he is in 199...<br/><br/>1990:<br/><br/>As Cole awakes,he discoverers that he is being held in a police cell,for allegedly beating up a cop.The police get a psychiatrist (Dr.Kathryn Raily) to speak to him,due to Cole talking about lots of ""crazy stuff"".With James telling Kathryn that five billion people are going to die in seven years,she decides that the best place for Cole to go,is to a mental hospital.At the hospital,Cole meets Jeffery Goines- a fellow patient in the hospital,who tries to help Cole escape.Later, Goines latches on to something that James says to him in a conversation about animal-testing,(which,as Cole gets pulled back to 2035,to (hopefully) be sent again to late 96) has affected Jeffery ,in ways that Cole cant even dream of...<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Whilst Pitt and Willis are praised for there excellent performances,I've always felt that Madeleine Stowe has always been over looked,for her strong performance as Raily.As Kathryn,Stowe does very well at expressing views that most audience members would have in the same situations.Stowe also performs the switch that the character experiences in the film,(where Raily starts at being very doubtful about what Cole is saying,to being the one that becomes more hungry to discover the truth about the virus than James is)extremely well,by making the progression of Railys attitude,feel very natural.<br/><br/>Whilst it seems that most people are now very accepting about Pitt doing roles of people who are a bit ""loose"",here he gives a stunning performance as Jeffery,with the scenes of him and Cole in the mental ward-which most actors would have performed with Goines being a ranting loony nutter,being impressively performed by Pitt as a man who is defiantly mentally disturbed,yet someone who is also very smart,who really wants to succeed with his plans.Although he will mainly be remembered for his fun action films,Willis is truly astonishing as Cole,giving a brilliant,strong,mature performance,with Willis also giving Cole a surprising amount of humanity,as the time travailing starts to scramble his brain.<br/><br/>Whilst the brilliant cast are always given attention,I feel that the star of the film is the truly breathtaking screenplay by Janet and David Peoples,which is able to keep the amazing complex plot going,with out ever letting it fall apart,that uses threads in the story that are set up right at the very beginning ,and instead of being hinted at too strongly,they are instead used intelligently as an underlying issue through out the film,until the unforgettable ending,when they are brilliantly revealed.Even though though the main love story,does have a few nods to Hitchcock's ""dream"" classic Vertigo,12 Monkeys is still its own thing,with it being wisely used,to let Cole show his desire. <br/><br/>Final view on the film: A mind-blowing perfect film."
"warzal01","7","0","0","28 October 2010"," A sci-fi film with time travel and real vs surreal
","The movie 12 Monkeys is a Sci-Fi film with many great actors such as Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe. Willis, who plays James Cole, is a survivor of a deadly virus that has killed all but 1% of the population. As a convict, he agrees to let scientists (who were all part of the survivors) send him to the past to attempt to collect any information regarding the virus to help save lives. Cole hopes to receive a pardon for doing this job. As he arrives in the year 1990, he is arrested after failing to cooperate with police and was babbling about the virus. He is given a mental evaluation and is later admitted to where he meets Jeff Goines, played by Brad Pitt. Goines is a complete lunatic who befriends him in the mental hospital.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie is real life vs. surreal. Scientists from the past who are evaluating Cole are astonished that he seems to think he is from the future. The whole time Cole is still on this mission to find the Army of the 12 Monkeys, who are expected to have spread this deadly virus. Cole kidnaps his psychiatrist, Dr. Railly (played by Madeline Stowe) who is surprisingly interested and in a way understanding of Cole and sets out to find Goines, as he discovers he is part of the 12 Monkeys. One relatable movie to this is Girl, Interrupted. Cole feels like he is the sane person in the mental hospital, much like Susanna (played by Winona Ryder) felt when she was admitted to the hospital.<br/><br/>One technique that emphasizes the theme is the lighting. In the mental hospital, the lighting is very bright and it allows the audience to see the faces and emotions of all the patients. Many people have glazed over looks on their faces from medications, and others have scrapes and scratches on their faces. The lighting while Cole is in sitting with the scientists underground and being reviewed is dark and dreary. It is supposed to give the feeling of being underground and the bizarre experiments they are performing on Cole. The film also used low-angle shots, which allowed emphasis on the characters and not the surroundings. One particular scene that is very noticeable is when Goines is showing Cole around the hospital when Cole first arrives. The emphasis on the characters allows the audience to focus on the quirky personalities of the patients."

Brad Pitt, I love him so much in this film, he is just a brilliant mental case. Yet he is not like the other patients, he sure is smart and a genius. The movie might seem a bit incomplete in the end, but you just have to think about the plot and the actual facts that were told. Because Jeffrey never said something about the virus or anything. Some found the ending a bit of a blob, they expected some more influencing and answering end. <br/><br/>All to all, I believe this movie is in my top 5, a must-see for any sci-fi fan!"

","Have you ever wondered about the line between sanity and insanity? This sci-fi drama directed by Terry Gilliam offers us his take on the subject. In the film 12 Monkeys we are able to view that line in its ever blurred dimensions. One minute you believe that the futuristic tale is true and the next you wonder if the main character James Cole, played by Bruce Willis is really just insane after all. Heck you may even question his psychiatrist's sanity before the film ends. One thing is certain; this fast paced film will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering who is sane or insane as the line between sanity and insanity is very thin and most often defined by those observing from the outside, the opinion of what is normal or abnormal is often in the eye of the beholder, or at the very least the majority accepted viewpoint. <br/><br/>Cole, a prison inmate, and the rest of the surviving population live in an underground world because in 1996 a pandemic virus kills most of the earth's population. The scientists in his underground home hope to obtain a sample of the virus in order to find a cure so they can leave their underground world and have begun experimenting with time travel as a means of obtaining the virus in its pure form. Cole is one of their ""volunteers"" and is sent back in time with the promise that he will receive a full pardon if he is able to meet his goal. <br/><br/>In his first journey back in time Cole arrives in 1993 and encounters Jeffrey Goines, played by Brad Pitt, in the mental institution where Cole has been placed due to his behavior upon arrival. Cole tells Goines in one of their conversations that he has traveled back in time because in 1996 a pandemic virus will kill billions of people and those who survive will be forced to live underground, Goines doesn't believe him, but is intrigued with the idea Cole has just planted. <br/><br/>Cole travels back and forth through time so often that he appears to struggle with reality. He recalls things that he remembers and then questions those memories, for most of the movie he is convinced that he has traveled back in time to bring back a sample of the virus to help those in the future. On his last trip back to the past he decides that he is crazy and is resolved to accept that reality, the only problem is now Dr. Railly, played by Madeleine Stowe, who all along has believed he is insane, now believes that he is indeed from the future. Before Dr. Railly reaches that conclusion however she too begins to question her own sanity and clearly begins to act in ways that one might associate with someone who has gone mad. <br/><br/>The lighting and angles used in this film act as a further barrier or suggestion of the real or unreal world of James Cole dependent upon the observers chosen point of view. When Cole is in his ""present"" world things are colorless and bleak, he often sees things in a distorted sense such as the orb that shows the multiple various monitors of ongoing still picture slide shows, movie clips and the faces of the scientists which are always shown through the orb monitors as though they were filmed using fun-house mirrors. <br/><br/>When Cole is visiting the past the world has color and beautiful music, even when it is bleak such as the time that he is in the mental institution there are still colorful characters such as Goines and TV shows advertising exotic and beautiful places which is not seen in his ""present day"" world. The music that Cole hears when he visits the past most often portrays songs of a beautiful world, and Cole is viewed as relishing the fresh air and sunshine. By contrast in his ""present day"" world there is no fresh air, no sunshine and it is not a beautiful place. One must make his or her own determination as to whether or not these depictions suggest the differences between the world as it is known today and the suggested post-apocalyptic world of the future or simply the grandiose imaginings of the truly insane. <br/><br/>The movie ends without disclosing whether or not he has truly traveled through time or is indeed insane. It does not tell us if Dr. Railly has suffered a mental break and has come to believe the delusions of her patient so significantly that she too cannot understand reality. Since either is possible, you will have to decide which possibility you choose to believe."
"Butter05","10","0","0","2 May 2010"," 12 Monkeys
","Terry Gilliam's pre-apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, ""12 Monkeys"" embodies all the nuances that a political satire and science fiction film can possess. Its socio-economic undertones and outright rebellious nature compel the viewer to evaluate the film and its characters on a more dynamic level. Take for instance the film's subtle hints at societal standards and political correctness. Brad Pitt's character, Jeffrey Gomes, states that ""there is no right or wrong only popular opinion,"" and if you don't ""buy"" into their ideas of capitalism etc. you're insane or crazy. The irony of this is that under normal circumstances had this issue been approached it would have been deemed interesting conversation. I believe that the inclusion of this particular dialogue was to attest the idea that individuals that do not subscribe to conformist or conventional thinking are considered inappropriate or ""divergent"". The term ""divergent"" is another reference to statements made by patients of the asylum where the main character James Cole, portrayed by Bruce Willis, is temporarily confined. It also makes light of militant groups and extremist action, which at the time the film was created wasn't as great a concern as say after the September 11 attacks. The film however can still be appreciated for its entertaining approach to time travel. Films like ""The Time Machine"" and The Terminator"" were largely successful due in part to their ability to incorporate political or other satirical messages into a film that would appeal to various audiences and demographics. The similarities of ""The Terminator"" and ""12 Monkeys"" are substantial. They both involve transitions between the present and future, and both involve some type of disaster that befalls mankind. The responsibility of saving earth has been assigned to only a few individuals in each film, and the conclusions of both films remain unknown after all characters involved attempt to facilitate a resolution or correction to past events that effect future occurrences. Although, ""12 Monkeys"" involves something a bit more realistic like biological agents, and ""The Terminator"" incorporates machines, both films are related by the fundamental idea that our present actions will have negative consequences for our future. Subsequently ""12 Monkeys"" was a cinematic marvel intelligently executed with all the pizazz and intrigue one could expect from a suspenseful, psychological thriller. It utilizes elements of surprise, action/adventure, science fiction and even horror to some extent to portray a future that even by today's standards is still quite possible, and with a little imagination creates a world that you will inevitably be entranced in"

","""12 Monkeys"" is a film that needs to be watched with the viewer's full attention! The movie is about a man, James Cole played by Bruce Willis, who is serving a prison sentence. He is picked as a ""volunteer"" to go back in time to try and find the virus that wiped the majority of humanity leaving the rest of the humans to live underground. With him doing this he could earn a pardon to get out of prison before his sentence is up. Because of this incentive James is focused on getting the job done, however after several of the events that occur James realizes he needs to discover himself.<br/><br/>During James Cole's venture back in time he realizes he was sent to the wrong year. This causes much chaos and lands him in a mental institution where he meets Kathryn Railly played by Madeleine Stowe and Jeffrey Goines played by Brad Pitt. Kathryn is a psychiatrist who later becomes James's kidnapped victim and friend. Jeffrey is quite a mental case as well as a son of a famous scientist.<br/><br/>This film can seem to be all over the place with James Cole constantly time traveling, getting into fights, running from the law, and trying to discover himself. With all this going on it is very important to watch this film without distraction or you may get confused. Actually I was a little confused with some scenes even with my full attention on the film. When watching you begin to think you know exactly what is going on then you start to question yourself just as the character James Cole does.<br/><br/>This film is a great mind playing film. Just as we know what is going to happen another event takes place that makes you question what is really going on. I compare this film with the film ""The Sixth Sense"". The directors of both films do a great job in having the viewers keep questioning what is really going on.<br/><br/>""12 Monkeys"" is great in terms of acting. I believe Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt did a great job in portraying the reality of their characters. Overall I thought this film had a great plot, however I wish the ending would have been more. I still, after finishing the movie, am questioning what really happened."

","Part 2 of Gilliams Trilogy of Americana follows Bruce Willis (in the greatest state of all, Pennsylvania) as he travels back and forth through time trying to find the cause of a virus that wiped out most of the human race. Before I begin, I have to say that I have a weakness for post-apocalyptic movies and time travel. Now to put them both in the same movie!? My head's gonna a'splode! This movie wasn't your typical go-back-in-time-and-save-the-girl type time travel movie. Bruce Willis' character, James Cole, isn't going back because he wants to but because he is forced to since he is a prisoner in post-apocalyptic Philadelphia. I, again, have to comment on Gilliam's directing style. He has a way of capturing craziness like no one else. Not only do we see his eccentric and outrageous characters blowing up and acting insane, but we also kind of feel it. Gilliam is a fan of epic close-ups and steady cam. Both give us a better feel of what's going on inside a character's head. I felt that a lot whenever Brad Pitt was having a schizophrenic moment in the movie. Side note, this movie promptly reminded me that Brad Pitt is an awesome actor. Brad Pitts frantic eyes and birdlike jerkiness made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Not uncomfortable like I don't want to be around retards but, more like I wanted to reach out to him and say ""Are you OK? Do you need some water?""

The effects launched by travel into the past are so fundamentally unpredictable, they can't stand up. He says he can't change things and then goes about changing things. I can sense the frustration in Bruce Willis's character. He is trying to buy favor with his own time. But how can he even have his own time if he changes the past, even in the smallest way. We could go on. Once we just choose to ignore these questions, we have a basic chase movie where the kidnap victim does begin to relate to her captor and his cause.

Throughout most of the movie you believe that James really is a time traveler who is out to stop the 12 Monkey Army, but somewhere in the second half of the film you start to think ""perhaps he really is just insane."" <br/><br/>Willis and Pitt's characters work very well off one another during their time in the insane asylum. Of course, Pitt's character is very fun and I really wished he could have been on the screen for longer than he was. <br/><br/>There is not much more I can really say about this movie. If you are looking for a mystery that you slowly solve throughout the course of the film, ""12 Monkeys"" is the perfect watch for you."
"bryanus","10","0","0","18 November 2009"," Bizarre and yet interesting
","This was a bizarre and yet very interesting film. It has a very dark and grimy feel to it. Bruce Willis' acting is very bizarre, not to mention Brad Pitt who plays a mental patient. This is perhaps Terry Gilliams' masterpiece (although I haven't seen Brazil). There is a very surreal quality to all the scenes, it sort of just takes you away. It has a very subtle plot, and you have to make sure you're following the movie very carefully and at a rapid pace or else you'd have to watch a major chunk of the movie again (this is especially true of someone who's never seen the movie before). It's a very lush and haunting movie, sometimes jarring even. There's a part in the movie that implies that the present is to some extent seeded with people from the future (or the past, I can't remember which (or even perhaps both, I'm sorry for the confusion, see, that's how the movie is!)). The comical parts would be exactly just that, comical; if they weren't so disturbing. This is the kind of movie that you definitely want to buy (and not just rent), to add to your collection. Serious movie buffs will be impressed."

","I'm way behind the times because I've just watched 'Twelve Monkeys' for the first time, 14 years after it was released in the theaters. I went off Terry Gilliam for awhile, can't really say why. I got involved in other stuff, I guess. Anyway, I missed having this masterful film under my belt all these years.<br/><br/>Recently I proclaimed 'Tideland' as having superseded 'Brazil' as his masterpiece. Now, in so short a time, 'Twelve Monkey's has snatched the crown from 'Tideland'. All three of these films are solid evidence of Gilliam being one of the great living directors.<br/><br/>What is most great about this movie, for me, is that I didn't know what was going to happen next. Nothing about it is predictable, even to the very last shot on the airplane to San Francisco.<br/><br/>I began to think this was a modern version of the nightmare classic 'Dead of Night', then, at the very end it turned out to be something quite different. Gilliam has never been a director to explain everything to a supposedly gawp-mouthed public, but relies upon them to be capable of rubbing a couple of brain cells together and figuring it out on their own.<br/><br/>My brain cells were so fuddled until the last scene that I gave up trying to second guess the ending. <br/><br/>It's a frequently depressing movie, showing modern society as corrupt and violent and cynical. It even began to seem preferable that 99% of the world population should be destroyed by a virus, but somehow, when the credits were running I abandoned that dark thought. It's also a very funny movie, thanks to the very subtle performances of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt and the scientists living in the future, all of whom seem slightly cracked, like the psychiatrists in the present time. Madelyn Stowe is superb throughout, and near the end of the movie becomes a tremendously moving presence.<br/><br/>This story blows holes in all the political-socio bickering that goes on between various factions with their hidden agendas and brings the viewer back to the main point, which is: we are alive and it's a miracle, and that's all that matters... make the most of it.<br/><br/>Brilliant cast, brilliant music, direction, cinematography, art direction... the whole ball of wax.<br/><br/>And Brad Pitt really CAN act when he's working with a great director.<br/><br/>A great film."

","Terminator, Donnie Darko and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure have all debated the mystic art of travelling to and from collective points in time. Throughout this wonderfully colourful and exuberant picture Gilliam contests the implications of time travel and how it affects society.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is the time traveller as he is sent from the future to suss out the beginning of the end for humanity. This complex ideology provokes meaning of health, disease in the face of humans and animals and strikes a provocative note for the way the world is being run. 14 years since its release and issues with animal testing and time travel are still present in our world and with this being a good preacher, alerting us to the environment's dangers; this is also a timeless picture, easily watchable again and again.<br/><br/>Like Donnie Darko you will need to watch it over and over to fully comprehend the hidden messages. The climax is heavily debated and open to many depictions. This is a very good picture owing to its preaching ideologies and masterful open situations.<br/><br/>However there are a few issues to be debated. For one the ending whilst brilliantly open still leaves a massive weight to be decided. There is an overload of characters with not a strong depiction on many except the central three. Though you will want to watch it again the first viewing gives the viewer an awful lot to deal with but it is certainly worth it come the finale.<br/><br/>Willis is good as the central protagonist keeping a clever restraint on his character's emotions whilst Brad Pitt's elaborately provocative protagonist excels in being mentally unstable but with a hidden agenda that adds delicious mystery and tension at all the right places. His Oscar nomination fully deserved.<br/><br/>Gilliam, a master of the unusual, brings his elaborate styling to this picture with the future depicted as cellmate survivors chosen to go into the past and the guard ruling from high chairs. The selection process is wonderfully weird with Cole's brief future stint on the earth's surface exceptionally breathtaking. This particular scene marks the picture's cinematography highlight with the snow and the lion placing the picture right into its main point, the future. There are occasional over steps, such as the weird ball shaped object Cole looks into before travelling in time and the section in the war seemed a bit unnecessary.<br/><br/>Whilst there are minor slip ups this is a wonderfully imaginative picture that excels on its issues of real life and the climate we live in. Gilliam shines with profound imagination with the story revolving and turning till the excellent end scene."

","This is a intriguing film with time travel in it although at first you may not understand what is going on, and is thought provoking cause of the time period Bruce Willis's character changes between. The story is basically Bruce Willi's character trying to save the world from a virus that will wipe out most of humanity while animals aren't effected by the virus, but the time travel and the laws behind it is quite realistic which makes it gripping. You also start to wonder throughout the movie if Bruce Willi's character is really going bonkers and just having crazy dreams or if he is legit and no one believes him. Bruce Willis was good in his role while not being his typical character like in a lot of his movies, cause in this one he is hopeless and weak while also being genuine. Brad Pitt also did a great job playing a psychotic character that is the leader of a group called ""12 Monkeys"". The dialogue was also amusing with it's irony, with it's complex but compelling sci-fi story, that is also clever and engaging. It's also stylish with it's intelligent time travel concept as the protagonist tries to change the past to save the future.

","La Jetée, the short that inspired this, is somewhat different, if there are a lot of similarities, and one could argue this as partially a feature remake. There is a long list of reasons why this is a masterpiece of cinema. Allow me to go over a couple: The time-travel makes sense, and the logic of it holds up here more than that of quite a few other films. It's surreal(and yet credible, and not so loose that it's difficult to follow) in the way we would expect from Gilliam, though the focus is considerably clearer. The ambiguity lasts from beginning to end, and you are not limited to one interpretation of what actually happens, and, just as important, what does not, in the course of this. You won't feel confident that you know what's going to happen next in this, with the one devastating exception, which is a mortal sin to spoil for anyone who hasn't taken this in on their own. Heck, it's got two star names of Hollywood, both playing against type and delivering performances that are beyond reproach. In general, the acting is impeccable. Stowe is very natural. The plot and concept is excellent, and the development throughout, the gradual uncovering that so skillfully appears to supply the audience with additional pieces of the puzzle, when it is in actuality also forcing us to ask the question, ""does the board even exist?"". You have to pay close attention to ""get"" everything, and viewing it only once may not suffice. With that said, this is satisfying and you come out of it having been told a full story. The pacing is spot-on, this doesn't really stand still at any time, yet you are allowed time to relax in-between the intense sequences, and are not overwhelmed to the point of being drained. This is immensely engaging and involving. You will be served quite a lot of food for thought, and you will find yourself emotionally affected. This is an amazing piece of film-making craft, technically speaking, as well; the lighting, cinematography and editing are astounding. The special effects are marvelous. Every character is well-written, you believe that people like these could exist. There is strong language, disturbing content and bloody violence in this. The Collector's Edition DVD comes with a 90-minute documentary that I will review on its individual page on the site, a theatrical trailer, production notes and a commentary track of Terry, the director, himself, and producer Charles Roven, and it is entertaining and informative. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a challenging piece where you won't always know exactly what's going on, and fans of intelligent science fiction. 10/10"

","Inspired by the 1962 French short film ""La Jetee"", this complex, interwoven tale from the pen of David and Janet Peoples will not appeal to a particularly broad audience. It concerns a story that takes some concentration, and many viewers may not feel it worth the effort.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is an observer from the year 2035 who has been sent back to the 1990's to gather information about a virus that wiped out ninety-nine percent of the earth's population. He does very well with the role, playing a reluctant ""volunteer"" who soon begins to take the view of psychiatrist Dr. Railly, who believes James Cole is out of his mind. As Railly, Madeleine Stowe impresses too, only beginning to believe Cole when he begins to doubt himself. A standout too is Brad Pitt, as the fruitcake son of a world renowned virologist (Christopher Plummer). Pitt earned himself an Academy Award nomination for this twisted turn.<br/><br/>The Ridley Scottesque sets (reminiscent of ""Alien"" and ""Bladerunner"") are a treat for the eye, and the inspired art is from Art Director Jeffrey Beecroft. Paul Buckmaster provides some effective, French-inspired music.<br/><br/>""Twelve Monkeys"" would have to be considered bizarre, which would be in keeping with director Terry Gilliam's previous work. Personally, I loved the way Gilliam brought the whole film together, milking the script for all the fascination and tension it contained. The plot is cleverly drawn out, and you're never quite sure what is reality, what is not, nor what may happen next. Gilliam is careful to maintain the feeling of hope, a way out for humanity, the possibility of an eleventh hour salvation or self-resurrection. We never know what the outcome will be. Themes of humanity's downward spiral and questions on the truth about mental illness permeate the film.<br/><br/>For people who seek films that are demanding, different and thought-provoking, this is a great sample.<br/><br/>Sunday, June 7, 1998 - Video<br/><br/>Although the first time viewer will get the most out of this, I am still wowed by this film even second time around. For those who don't enjoy complex, sometimes confusing movies, you ought to forget ""Twelve Monkeys"". If, on the other hand, you love deep, thought provoking pics which tackle heavy subjects, this if for you.<br/><br/>The subject of time travel has always fascinated me, and Terry Gilliam's flick is not only a classy piece of entertainment, but an interesting study on the time travel theorem as well. Gilliam handles with gripping expertise an ingenious plot from David and Janet Peoples (adapted from the short French film ""La Jetee"").<br/><br/>Amazing in the lead role is Bruce Willis, perfect as the convict James Cole, who is sent 'back' to 1996 to gather information. Madeleine Stowe also impresses as the psychiatrist who is baffled by Cole's apparent alternate reality. Manic in support is the talented Brad Pitt as the leader of the loony ""army of the twelve monkeys"". He becomes a bit much on second viewing though. Also stars Christopher Plummer.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Beecroft's production design is stark and affronting, and it is skillfully photographed by Roger Pratt. Astute editing comes from Mick Audsley and Paul Buckmaster's score ideally captures the theme. A must.<br/><br/>Wednesday, February 3, 1999 - Video"

","Terry Gilliam might not be as well known and appreciated as the Spielbergs, the Kubricks and the Scorseses of our world but he certainly has the same status as those directors, especially in the world of movie making business itself. Just look at all those big name actors who are always willing to play in his movies, for a very small payment, also often in some quite small and odd roles, like Robert De Niro in ""Brazil"" and Brad Pitt in this movie.<br/><br/>Gilliam movies are not easy to place in one corner. They often have surreal elements of pure chaos but they are yet made with an incredible eye for detail and precision. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is above all things a science-fiction movie but unlike any that you have ever seen before. It doesn't use any fancy effects or futuristic looking places. It's instead more set in the 'present' time and the futuristic elements from the movie are all far from looking settling. It's a filthy and depressing future, which also helps to bring you close to the main character. It certainly is one of the essential science-fiction movies from the '90's.<br/><br/>It's a very visually rich movie, that is very imaginatively put together. But no, the movie is not just purely style over substance. It also has a really great written story, that takes on original approach on time traveling. It doesn't progress as you think it does and the story is in constant motion and development. It provides the movie with some great moments, as well as a great and unforgettable ending, that makes the overall movie perhaps even better.<br/><br/>It stars Bruce Willis in the main lead but in a role like you have never seen him in before. It's perhaps his most emotional and involving roles. It also stars Brad Pitt in a totally crazy role, before he had reached the true status of a big Hollywood celebrity (the movie has already began production and signed on Pitt before the release of movies such as ""Se7en"" and ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles""). It still is perhaps the best role Pitt ever played and it also earned him his first Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>It also is perhaps Terry Gilliams best movie till date and it also certainly still is his best known one and commercial most successful one, despite the fact that this is not really a mainstream movie and this certainly also is not Gilliams style, as can be seen in this unique, visually and narratively strong movie.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","""Twelve Monkeys"" is an intense sci-fi thriller that while strung together with great skill is particularly mind- numbing. A combination of time travel and both dialogue and camera-work that will have you thinking you're just as insane as some of the characters, this is one of director Terry Gilliam's most complex projects, although for Gilliam, complex is a relative term.<br/><br/>""Monkeys"" stars Bruce Willis as Cole, a man from the future sent on a mission to 1996, right before the outbreak of a virus that will kill off all but a percent of the world's population. He's not supposed to change the past, but merely gather things to understand it, which hopefully includes a sample of the virus so an antidote may be found. To explain in any more detail would require way too much explanation, so I will leave it at that. Let's just say he goes back and forth a lot with little to no explanation. To satisfy curiosity with the other stars, however, Madeleine Stowe plays a psychiatrist whose fate slowly intertwines with Cole's and Brad Pitt plays a mentally insane person Cole first meets at an asylum.<br/><br/>The film features Gilliam's signature hand-held camera-work and tilted angles which creates a sense of the insanity and uncertainty of what exactly is true and what imagined. There are so many forces and characters at work in this film and nothing ever grounds it enough to make any kind of sense. You get where it's going and where it ends up, but nothing is clearly spelled out. Nothing. Gilliam would prefer to leave you confused and many people will be.<br/><br/>As confusing as it may be at times, that's not to take away from this film's many strengths. Willis and Pitt are excellent in these roles. While Pitt first appeared a bit unnatural as an insane person with tics and such, he really transforms himself as the film goes on. Willis, as he is best at, shows a tremendous amount of sensitivity and fragility despite being a hard- nosed character. The script does lend him a hand with this in that he's not a typical action protagonist, he's more a really troubled man with a tough guy demeanor. Don't fool yourself into thinking this is action sci-fi. This is more ala ""Blade Runner,"" although it would be a crime to compare the two beyond that.<br/><br/>The script is strong from David (and Janet) Peoples, who also had a hand in ""Blade Runner."" It really is hard to discern what he did versus what was Gilliam's, that's how well these styles mix. There's plenty of symbolism that is far from subtle. Monkeys appear everywhere in this film and countless films are referenced and/or shown, particularly Hitchcock. This is clearly a thoughtfully crafted film and it paces itself very well too. While more themes would have made it a more resonant sci-fi film, instead it prides itself more on being stylistic and at that it succeeds."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","0","0","6 August 2008"," Downbeat dystopia from Terry Gilliam; one of the most credible science-fiction films of the last twenty years
","Blending themes of memory, madness, time-travel and prophesy into a complex and labyrinthine collage of sights, sounds and scenery, Twelve Monkeys (1995) sets about creating a cold and disturbed world of paranoid isolation and violence; not only in the post-apocalyptic sequences that are rife with the requisite iconography of disused buildings, burnt-out cars and discarded toys, but in the present-day sequences, which here brim with a jarring evocation of grimy decay and an antiseptic sheen devoid of love and emotion. Is the film suggesting that our own indifference, cynicism and desensitised nature will ultimately prove more deadly than any man-made virus, or are we simply doomed to repeat the failings of the past over and over again until the end of time? It's a novel idea and one that seems further cemented by the redemptive romantic subplot between the two central characters, the warm tones of Louis Armstrong on the soundtrack and the significance of the child's gaze; which opens and closes the film with a suggestive look of innocence, awe and youthful curiosity.<br/><br/>The shot of the little boy at such pivotal stages in the film shows Gilliam's attempt to suggest the malleability of time; the endless potential that exists at such a young age that can be either squandered or used in later life, and indeed, a subtle comment on the way that time itself is able to corrupt innocence as a result of circumstance. The young boy, so full of hope and wonderment, is largely unrecognisable in the adult variation of the same character; frightened and scarred by a nightmarish future by way of a third-world abstraction. Through the claustrophobic atmosphere created by the combination of cluttered production design and distorted, wide-angle lenses that Gilliam pushes right into the faces of his actors to create a disturbing exaggeration (underpinning the central character's fear and confusion of seeing the world for the first time), the film becomes an overwhelming and certainly unforgettable experience; with the depiction of an almost post-nuclear holocaust, where only the remnants of existence are left in the catacombs of industry, creates a potential future nightmare that is plausible in its reality.<br/><br/>We also have the central references to the wordless poetry of Chris Marker's short-form masterpiece La Jetée (1962) and the warped beauty of Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958); with the two themes of both films being intertwined with the more obvious dystopic, science-fiction elements of the script and the themes aforementioned. Without question, this is Gilliam's bleakest film, with the presentation of the subject matter and the look that the director and his team have attempted seeming to lack the often trademark sense of humour and colour that made even a film as crushing as Brazil (1985) seem positively warm and nostalgic. All of this is reflected in the design and the mise-en-scene, with the colour scheme featuring a dull rust against a production design of absolute ruin; as we move from one dilapidated setting to the next with this collection of oddball characters ranting and raving to the camera, combined with that wounded, downbeat narrative, which makes the experience all the more disheartening.<br/><br/>That said, the intelligence of the script and the texture of the performances under Gilliam's direction help to make the oppressive and depressing atmosphere easier to take; with the final moments of the film even suggesting the odd glimmer of hope, albeit, one that is punctuated again by the child's reflective gaze casting further doubt on the potential future ahead. Even though it might be considered a continual downer, Twelve Monkeys is still one of Gilliam's most impressive and original films; a grand fusion of post-apocalyptic science fiction and time travel fantasy with much depth and a shocking sense of humanity. It's not only one of Gilliam's greatest achievements as a filmmaker - offering us a continuation on the themes of Time Bandits (1981), Brazil and The Fisher King (1991) - but is also one of the greatest science-fiction films of the 1990's; if not the most credible."

","First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. The story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. But that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. As far as the direction goes, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. So, if you are getting ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you'll miss it.

","The story of this film is truly remarkable. A virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. The only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say, ""The Twelve Monkeys did it."" Thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 Billion people. Apparently animals do not contract this disease. Day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. All they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (Or at least thats what the poster says.) So a current convict named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent as a ""volunteer"" to get some samples from above. After he does his ""volunteer"" work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. Cole accepts and the story of the Twelve Monkeys begin.<br/><br/>Throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times, from 1990, to some time during the 1950's.

The whole story is very well done and I would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending. I personally didn't like the ending of the movie and I was very disappointed. I just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen, but it isn't everyone who thinks this way. So I gave it a 8, but if everyone had the same opinion as me I would give it a 6 or 7.<br/><br/>For the whole acting of the film, I give it a A+. Bruce Willis is great for this role and he acts good, but Brad Pitt is completely 100% excellent. His acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. I never really cared for Brad Pitt in till I saw him in this and Fight Club. There characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more... insane in this film.

With the brilliant story to back the great performances; and to back that up, Terry Gilliam's superb directing."
"LaFeeChartreuse","9","0","0","7 July 2007"," Brilliantly twisted, and some astonishingly good acting from actors I usually don't like
","I really enjoyed this -- I'm a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at that (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, shall we?).<br/><br/>I particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes -- the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other.<br/><br/>It was also really well done aesthetically -- the art direction was really great, and I wish I'd been able to see it on the big screen. The future scenes had a similar feel to Brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling.<br/><br/>But perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors I normally don't much like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pitt especially -- I'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act (contrary to what I'd originally thought), but this one really outdid them. I actually found myself asking my friends at one point ""Are you SURE that's Brad Pitt?"" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admittedly that may not be saying too much)."
"dragonshield","9","0","0","26 June 2007"," Intelligence in its purest form
","""Twelve Monkeys"" is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films.<br/><br/>The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named ""La Jetée"" (1962) which I haven't seen, but I must thank the director and writer of the movie, Chris Marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of ""Twelve Monkeys"". I read a little about ""La Jetée"", it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by Paul Buckmaster.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam, who we remember from Monty Python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before, but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all.<br/><br/>What comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example ""The Sixth Sense"" as well, but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too, yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist of James Cole, who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it, so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Twelve Monkeys"" is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing."

Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the 'Munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. I would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting I've seen. It certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as his ""7½th"" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really 'his' film' - doesn't do the film itself justice.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's portrayal of Goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic. Watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum. It's disturbing and distracting.<br/><br/>Probably a coincidence, the Louis Armstrong song 'What a Wonderful World' was used at the end of both '12 Monkeys' and the final episode of the TV series of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. Both the film and the TV series also featured British actor Simon Jones.<br/><br/>'12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain.

"caiomin4","9","0","0","6 June 2006"," A breathtaking feast of visuals and uncertainties
","One of the most appealing elements of a Gilliam film is that the well-concocted visuals, the unsettling backdrops, and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience. ""12 Monkeys"" is evidence of Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. ""12 Monkeys"" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam's repertoire:oppressive/recessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel realms. In this film Gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. The two nearly identical bathing scenes of Cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. The title itself is a mark of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience. The film has immense re-watch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites."

Anyone can understand this movie very simply, I've heard too many complaints about how hard it is to follow the story and Brad Pitt's insanity (which I thought was amazing step in his acting career) .

"Danny_G13","7","0","0","28 January 2005"," As complex as they come, but ultimately rewarding
","This is a film which does not pretend to be simple, nor does it try to be straight forward, but stick with it to the end and it is ultimately a pretty satisfying ride, even if certain illogicalities serve to baffle.<br/><br/>This Terry Gilliam effort is a slightly apocalyptic tale of the future, with mankind's majority having been wiped out by some kind of virus. Now underground where the air is breathable, our future selves have developed time travel it seems, and wish to use it to send volunteers back in time in order to somehow figure out how the virus broke out and use that knowledge to escape the confines of their enforced prison.<br/><br/>The always highly personable Bruce Willis is James Cole, one of said volunteers in this future time. He goes back in time but ends up in 1990. Suffice to say his mission to find '12 Monkeys', which seems to be some kind of army responsible for the problems mankind now suffers, goes very wrong and the rest of the film is a convoluted story which requires a good level of concerted concentration from the viewer.<br/><br/>Without question this is a demanding picture. The plot and direction are rich with subtleties and vast amounts of information, and you need to be on your toes to make sense of it all. The biggest problem with it on a technical level is much of the dialogue is viciously mumbled or delivered way too quickly. Lots of it simply passes you by, particularly Brad Pitt's over imposing Jeffrey and his rapid fire diatribe. Willis' Cole doesn't suffer this so badly, fortunately, but the overall audio quality perhaps lacks at times and the clarity of dialogue could be better.<br/><br/>The actual performances are generally pretty good. Willis' Cole is neatly understated, and makes an effective reluctant hero. Madeleine Stowe is fairly convincing as Railly, the psychiatrist who initially takes Cole in as a patient when he arrives in 1990 and babbles inanely about nonsensicals, but Pitt is basically a bit too boisterous and too much as Jeffrey, a mental institute patient Cole meets in the hospital in 1990.<br/><br/>As touched on earlier, the direction is pretty decent, and it helps the story move on reasonably fluidly. It's maybe not quite as immersive as it should be, but it does enough to facilitate the narrative.<br/><br/>Overall it's a decent film really, and if you find yourself interested in philosophy and determinism et al you'll find this particularly satisfying. You'll also get a kick out of it as a time travel movie.<br/><br/>There are certainly a fair few inconsistencies, and things which make no sense, but it does enough to merit inclusion as one of the better films I've seen."

","This movie has a very complicated plot, but only after having read some of the other comments I noticed how very complicated it is.

I am referring to the old woman speaking to the psychotic killer at the end of the scene She also appears among the people around Bruce Willis in his scenes in the future. The appearance of this old woman seems to hint at the possibility that the past can be changed indeed (after the people in the future found out who is responsible for the pandemic that kills mankind they send a killer themselves; at least that's how I interpret this scene). Nothing is said about her success and what indeed would become of the future should she succeed (this is one of the crucial paradoxes of time travel).

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>In 1996 the Academy Awards had a wide variety of decent films up for nomination. In a ceremony celebrating features like ""Braveheart"", ""Usual Suspects"", ""Nixon"", ""Il Postino"", ""Apollo 13"" and countless other quality films, one film which perhaps wasn't praised enough was the magnificent ""Twelve Monkeys"".<br/><br/>The premise is actually a relatively simple idea. Sometime in the future, convict James Cole (Bruce Willis) is ""volunteered"" to travel back through time. As a result of a virus released in the year 1996, humanity has been forced to flee the surface and escape under the ground. With only 1% of the population surviving, times are hard, but using a developed timetravel technology, scientists believe humanity can be saved. Cole, sent back firstly to 1990 and eventually to 1996, is introduced to psychologist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who fails to believe him and places him in an institute. Forced to take different drugs, Cole is introduced to fellow inmate Jeffrey Goines (Oscar nominated Brad Pitt). Goines, a rich man's insane son would eventually be released and Cole will be forced to solve the mystery of the virus and Goines' involvement in the mysterious Twelve Monkeys.<br/><br/>""Twelve Monkeys"" is a brilliant, brilliant film. With Terry Gilliam as director, the film is given this extreme warped feel with extreme characters and extreme settings. No character being more extreme than Goines who is played to perfection by Pitt. Pitt, whilst perhaps fairly loosing the Oscar to Kevin Spacey's performance in ""the Usual Suspects"", is almost freaky in the way he uses his eyes and hands to show a man who has some interesting ideas on society, but simultaneously is what we would classify as insane. Goines himself points out that ""There is no such thing as right and wrong, there's just popular opinion."" However, whilst this is true of Bruce Willis' character who nobody believes, in the case of Pitt's rich kid, perhaps even those with a sceptical view on insanity would be willing to lock this kid away.<br/><br/>As well as Willis as the man from the future and Pitt as the kid with the screw loose, Madeleine Stowe as the psychologist with denial issues about Willis' story is superb. Showing a suitable level of caring yet scepticism, Stowe could probably find a job in the ""X-Files"" replacing Gillian Anderson.<br/><br/>It's hard to know what else to say really. The scripting is first class with some memorable lines, the directing is typical Gilliam craziness, the acting is top notch, even the soundtrack, which at times feels unmatched with the subject, is superb. All in all, there's little which can be said to criticise this film. Perhaps not the greatest film of all time, but a worthy contender for the top 200. Watch this film and be astounded."

On re-watching it, I realized that this is truly a great film, dealing with a lot more than just the old who decides who is insane question. One of the major themes is that even though humanity has developed far superior technology by 2035, it's being run by the same incompetent bureaucracy we've had since the time of Caesar. In one scene, when Bruce Willis has been returned to his own time after finding the information he was sent to find, his superiors are behaving so bizarrely that he begins to believe, and the audience along with him, that maybe he really is insane and the entire future world is just a hallucination. This movie plays fair by the rule that nothing in the past can be changed, and most of the action takes place in the past of 1990 or 1996. Bruce is sent back not to prevent the spread of the virus, but just to retrieve a sample of it so that scientists in the future can develop a cure for it. The cinematography is a tour-de-force of point of view work. When Willis is first admitted to the mental institution, drugged up and disoriented in time, no shot is fully perpendicular, no composition balanced. Brad Pitt is a wonder as one of the mental ward patients. He's completely manic and full of energy. He's the first clue in the movie as to why it might be called 12 monkeys. My test of a good movie is always whether I want to see it again. This is especially true of a Chinese-puzzle movie like this. Once you know how it ends, is there any interest in watching again. In this case the answer is certainly. Willis says to Madeleine Stowe while they're watching ""Vertigo"" that visiting the past is like watching an old movie. You can't change the way it comes out, but you notice different details. This movie is so rich in details and ideas that it will stand up to many viewings."

","James Cole is sitting in a prison in a distant future, his only change to get freed is to volunteer for a time travel test that will send him back to find the source of a virus that wiped out 5 billion people in 1996. However they send him too far, and he is arrested and send to an institute where he is defined as being insane, he makes a magic houdini escape. While being at the mental institute he meets two people that will have great effect on his ""future"" life.<br/><br/>2 days ago i saw Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, expecting a masterpiece from what appeared to be one of the more creative minds of Hollywood, i was very disappointed, but i saw the potential in the directing. Now i see Twelve Monkeys, and i must admit, this movie was very challenging, original and extremely unpredictable, it can be analyzed in many different directions, which is what i think is the strength of a true masterpiece, a movie that can have different meanings depending on how your mind is built. ""A movie can have a different effect on you depending on when in your life you see it, and the state of your mind at the time"" Something like that is said in this movie, and it defines the movie pretty well.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so damn great is the constant twists, you will find yourself guessing all the time, at times i felt very confused, at other times i thought i had everything in place, then a twist and you're lost again, this makes the movie a constant original and unpredictable experience, and the end, which can be interpretated in a large amount of different ways, is very powerfull and mind bending, which is really fantastic, this is a movie that will be looked back at in many years as an even greater masterpiece.<br/><br/>The directin is very firm, Terry Gilliam has his own style, which obviously includes many alternative camera angles, which gives the whole movie a feeling of being unreal and portraying a fantasy world, and i feel confident that if we asked him why he used this, there would be a deeper symbolizing meaning with them, i think they describe certain parts of the movie. This movie is a work of a true genius.<br/><br/>This movie would not have worked without Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, each are they giving one of their great performances of their life. Especially Brad Pitt i admite for his role as a crazy lunatic in this movie, the way he portrays this semi psychopath is just so realistic and fantastic. Bruce Willis is the counterpart, also giving a performance as a rather mentally disturbed person (That is the way i felt he got portrayed), he does an amazing and convincing job, together these are bringing the movie the energy and soul it needs.<br/><br/>To sum it all up. They say you can talk about a true masterpiece forever, there will always be new things to discuss, there will never be anyone with a opinion and interpretation of the movie that is 100% identical, well i feel that this is one of those movies that can always be talked about, i would love to analyze this, as especially the ending is very powerfull and unique. But also the entire movie itself, there are many things that a lot will feel differently and understand differerently. Everyone will of course understand the movie the same way, but the deeper meaning of the movie, and the actual effect of the twist, that is what makes this movie so strong.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Twelve monkeys is what I think of when I think about the genre of SciFi. It has time travel, adventure, violence, ang Terry Gilliam's sence of weirdness and humor and direction. Terry Giliam has the ability to create and direct films with an ease. I won't bore you with plot details because everybody knows the plot, but if you want to enjoy a thinking man's film that explores time travel and it's effects upon the human psyche then rent or buy twelve monkeys.

"psikill","8","0","0","1 April 2004"," Terry Gilliam's Vision of Time Travel
","Terry Gilliam succeeds, once again, in making a film full of colorful figures, tight angles and close shots, making it interesting along the away. I must say that I loved many of other Gilliam's films, like `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' or `The Fisher King' and I was very anxious to see `Twelve Monkeys'. The story is centered mainly in time-travel experience, and how that can be malicious to somebody's life and to his/her surroundings.<br/><br/>Spoilers: The story begins in a near future, when a convict named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is chosen to travel back in time in order to stop the evil army of The Twelve Monkeys. In fact, in the future that the film sets place in, people live under the ground, because there was a lethal virus, released by this army, that destroyed almost the entire population of the Earth, and the survivors decided to hide under the ground, letting the animals rule Earth again. Cole gets sent to the wrong year, being immediately sent to a mental institution where he meats Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), a crazy patient of the hospital. Terry Gilliam involves us in the story, developing a sense of hope in the viewer, making him have compassion for the cause that Brad Pitt's character fights for, and also develops a romance between Cole and Railly. Finally the story ends, where the director gives his personal touch about what time travel is, after all, about, adding a little bit of irony, tragedy and at the same time, hope... and he does it so well. End of Spoilers.<br/><br/>`12 Monkeys' is marked, without a doubt, by its direction. It happened in other Terry Gilliam's films. He develops the film with his traditional close shots and tight angles with his camera. The acting, I must say, was pretty good, especially Brad Pitt. In fact, I think this was his film of affirmation in the Hollywood community (this was before Se7en) as an actor. Bruce Willis led a steady performance, alongside Madeleine Stowe, who, in my opinion, had better days. The plot isn't that complicated to follow, actually it's very linear with no significant twists and thought provoking acts. (Well come to think of it, time travel is a really serious topic).<br/><br/>Overall, `Twelve Monkeys' is an entertaining film, that almost keeps you in the edge of your seat. Some disappointing and boring parts, others very extraordinary in terms of film making and also very exciting, but nothing out of the ordinary. This isn't really Gilliam's best, nevertheless I recommend it.<br/><br/>PsIKiLL's Rating: 8/10"

","The Army of the Twelve Monkeys, with a psychotic leader (Pitt), is responsible for releasing a deadly virus into the human race resulting in the death of 5 billion people in the year 1996. A time traveler (Willis) from the year 2035 must go back into the past to collect the virus in it's pure form, before it mutates, and help return the human race to the surface of the earth, in the year 2035. The survivors have been forced to live underground to prevent from being infected and animals released by the Twelve Monkeys are now free to roam the surface once more.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler Alert:<br/><br/>12 Monkeys, from the very creative Terry Gilliam, is one of the best, if not the best, time travel movie I've seen. It is produced with only one minor flaw (Stowe somehow remembers Willis) and is easily forgivable considering the rest of the film and the acting performances. Instead of going back into the past to change the future, the concept of this movie is to go back into the past to get information to help the future at it's present state, if that makes any sense. After all, if one were to go back in time to change something from happening, what would happen to the people that have their time altered? They wouldn't remember, or even be the same conscious being, so what would be the point of that? In a sense, it really wouldn't matter to them, not directly anyways. I've always had trouble with this in time travel films, and the reason I like this movie's plot so much is because it's premise is, `you cannot change something that has already happened.' Very clever, and less confusing. Unlike the Terminator movies, were they simply try to change the past altogether and prevent the future from ever happening.<br/><br/>The acting performances are quite convincing, particularly Brad Pitt's version of a schizo-psychotic crazy person with a lazy eye, and especially when they're in the asylum. He was brilliant in his role as the head of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, Jeffrey Goines, and you begin to believe he's really crazy. Willis and Stowe do a great job as well.<br/><br/>Fans of Terry Gilliam can expect his usual dark industrial/apocalyptic vision of the future as seen in Brazil. And considering the behavior and nature of the human race, it isn't all that far fetched to the open mind. This is a must for Gilliam fans, pure and simple. 9/10"

","Twelve Monkeys is perhaps Terry Gilliam's best picture, and it's easy to see why. While most, if not all, of his movies maintain similar disjointedness (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) to them, Twelve Monkeys integrates all parts of the story into one satisfying moviegoing experience. Each part of the film is integrated into the gratifying whole.<br/><br/>The characters of Twelve Monkeys never stray outside of their rationale; while they do change and grow, the writing and the acting never betrays them, and by the end of the movie you don't feel like you're watching Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, because you aren't. You're seeing their characters in a world they cannot control.<br/><br/>The scenery is amazing in its consistency and believability.

It is this very quality of the movie, which makes it too overbearingly sickening, and at the same time, a really good one, and worth pondering on. <br/><br/>The whole movie revolves around time-travel. This itself sounds a bit insane. If this is not enough, the muddled characters, and the disturbingly unimaginable path the movie goes through, only to reach a seemingly absurd end, could prove to be too much on the senses; and if one is looking for even a teensy weensy bit of reality, then this movie has all the essential elements to render it as one of the worst sci-fi ever.<br/><br/>
On the flipside, the movie also has all the sine qua non of a very well-made science-fiction flick, only if taken in the right sense. The movie is actually meant to be a crazy dream. Considering the concept of the movie, it is best made, like a crazy dream. The acting is extraordinary. With insanity' being the cool word binding the movie, both the lead actors, Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, do justice to the nutty parts, assigned to them. Complementing the acting, are the symbolic backdrops: the subterranean world immersed in red metallic shades (hell), and the sublunary world, bitten with the bitterest icy cold (living hell.) <br/><br/>This flick is best enjoyed, if one empathizes with the underlying messages behind the whole inanity of the movie and its characters: what will result the apocalypse? Is it man who will be solely responsible for apocalypse? Or, what on earth, are we humans doing with this planet? Is science too dangerous to handle?

","Director Terry Gilliam and writer David Peoples, both talented in their own right, have collaborated to create the best movie of their careers. Twelve Monkeys is a time travel story mixed with an apocalyptic air about a killer virus and a man from the future who must go back in time to stop it.  But the movie is also about mental illness, it's about what constitutes reality & non-reality, and it's about how small mistakes of identity or incorrect assumptions can alter the course of history.<br/><br/>Weaving a multi-textured and highly nuanced script from Peoples, Gilliam invents a movie that stands up to repeated viewings and seems to reveal more layers of itself each time it's watched.  Performances from Bruce Willis as the time traveler, Cole, and especially Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Gomes, the mentally disturbed son of a viral scientist, head up a cast of sturdy, if somewhat over the top, performances (keep in mind that this is Terry Gilliam, and over the top is par for the course).<br/><br/>Any who dismiss Twelve Monkeys as a silly exercise in filmmaking or a confusing movie about time travel have missed the point.  It is both of those...but it is made that way intentionally and used as a thin commercial hook to disguise a deep and meaningful film, something American audiences tend to shy away from.<br/><br/>High credit to Peoples and Gilliam.

The time travel is taken as something that just happens, they don't try and bore you with an explanation of how it works. The plot isn't spelt out to you- you need to remain concentrating, and at the end, you can sit there thinking of where the plot holes are (there are very few, though some people would have you believe otherwise). Where some films are content with just one plot twist, this film has many, each one adding something major to the plot. I can understand why people don't like Twelve Monkeys. Some people don't get the plot. Some people do get the plot, and think it's trying to be too clever. Some people just don't like Bruce Willis or Brad Pitt, though I think they create believable characters and DO show an ability to act. Some people just don't have my tastes. This is a clever film that will leave you thinking.

","I need to get a good copy of this, because I taped it off of bloody digital cable and the movie looks like a dark impressionist painting half the time. But this film is a definite keeper. We've been peppered with these altered reality movies of late, and most of them stink, and all for the same reason. They set out to confuse the hell out of us, which is ok by itself. I think most people still love a good mystery, and are usually up for a mental challenge when giving a movie a try. The problem usually is in the revelation. Which if it makes sense, i.e. Vanilla Sky, is usually a major letdown because of its triteness. Or in the cases of Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive, the moviemaker never intended to answer your questions fully in the first place. 12 Monkeys kinda puts it all together in that its mentally stimulating in its buildup, and then goes on to reward us with a well thought out resolution of the events, that loses none of the imagination and I guess sheer horror. Time travel to the past we know is impossible, so that even a yeoman's effort like this still has its annoyances in the loopholes of logic that simply have to be accepted. But you can get past them here, and the story keeps you totally tuned in. Gilliam almost seemed to learn from the mistakes of Brazil, and just tweak it a bit to bring it more down to earth. That's all he needed apparently."

","Terry Gilliam is a mad genius who in a wickedly clever way combines sci-fi, the ennui of an impending apocalypse, film noir, and star-crossed romance in this classic mind bender that needs to be watched over and over to be enjoyed. Will Bruce Willis save society and discover who unleashed the virus that killed millions and forced survivors to live underground in his erratic court appointed trips through time? Is Brad Pitt simply an insane rich kid with too much time and medication on his hands or the potential cause of the fall of civilization? Will Madeleine Stowe crack the case of the patient she has fallen in love with before she herself becomes insane? Will the people of Philadelphia ever get another movie that utilizes the city to such madcap and insane lengths? (Only in Philadelphia could this film exist). Will I forever have nightmares about the Philadelphia International Airport? Will the viewers be sucked into an elliptical vortex of darkly comic, hauntingly sad, and ultimately tragic ends to our beloved mind tripping characters? SEE THIS MOVIE!"

","This was a story that was well thought out to say the least. it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. the entire time i was wondering whether or not Cole was insane. i am in awe of how well the acting was in this movie. i cannot tell you how impressed i was with Brad Pitts proformance. until this movie i thought he did the best in ""Kalifornia"", which by the way, if you enjoyed this movie i would recomend Kalifornia. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is far better though. Bruce Willace does a  good job acting as well. he is definatley heroic but not like the John McClaine type. his character is well developed and very convincing. i rate this film a 9/10 for its great plot, phenominal acting and its different yet intriguing feel about it."

","Twelve Monkeys combines an exceptional story with some really good performances.<br/><br/>In this movie Bruce Willis (James Cole) shows us, once again, that he became more and more an actor. Madeleine Stowe (Dr. Kathryn Railly)shines as the doctor who wants to help the poor Cole. And Brad Pitt is just brilliant as the insane Jeffrey Goines.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite unique. In the future, prisoners are sent back into time to find out why we are all dead. All the people in the future know is that a virus killed almost the entire worldpopulation.<br/><br/>To find out more about that virus prisoners are sent back to time. James Cole is one of those ""volunteers"". But things went terribly wrong. Cole is sent back to the wrong year and ends up in a mental institution. From there on, he tries to convince his doctors that he is not insane.<br/><br/>The movie is very well made. It swings back an forward into time and does that in such a way that even the viewer starts to question Cole. At the end of the movie you really wonder wether Cole is a hero, or just another mental patient.<br/><br/>This is a must see film, and if you want to understand it, you'd better watch it twice!"

","---MILD SPOILERS---<br/><br/>An interesting plot, dressed in an eccentric manner and mood.<br/><br/>As in all movies that boast more than a Ford model-T newly off an assembly line (any colour as long as it's black) for a plot, the first need for critique concerns the storyline itself. The plot is certainly interesting, but not necessarily confusing if one pays adequate attention. Even after the first miraculous houdini act by Cole, (JC's first miracle?), the viewer is in no doubt that Cole is not insane. At that point, Cathryn swings towards the middle, while Cole is convinced he is not. It's ironic that by the end of the movie Cathryn has swung to full non-insanity to join the viewers' opinion, while Cole is almost certain he's a looney. Kudos to Gilliam for not swinging the cheap pendulum of insanity-or-not for the viewer in favour of brownie points.<br/><br/>The cinematography is solid and indicative of a post-apocalyptic underground world with hints (empty streets, posters, rubbish) flowing even into the present. This world has had it even before the virus-bearing chap went on holidays, which is also verified by the incidental manner in which Gilliam and the authors treat him. No character development, just bare-bones motive and background. The world has had it alright.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis delivers a good performance, such that one might think that the role was created for him. Madeleine Stow tries hard but flings between overacting and boredom. Brad Pitt copes (and copies) adequately.<br/><br/>The demented, pythonesque presentation of the future scientists obviously seen through Coles' demented disposition does not fit well. Keep the viewer stationary Mr Gilliam, this one's a no-no. We at least deserve a decent glimpse into the future, which we could perhaps forgive the lack of, if you cared to excuse yourself because of your low (how low is Â£29m?) budget.<br/><br/>Worthwhile of repeated viewings, and a very good sci-fi flick."

","I loved this movie, especially the superlative acting (as always) by Brad Pitt. Bruce Willis is also fantastic -- very human and believable. I did find the music to be a bit overwhelming & intrusive in one or two scenes, but that seems to be the trend in today's movies.<br/><br/>The plot is complex and convoluted enough that after the first viewing, I found myself confused about a few details, so I settled back on the couch and watched it again. The second time around I picked up on several details and the ending came together for me. I love movies with an unexpected twist at the ending, and this was one of the twistiest!<br/><br/>My only real complaint is the lack of any real discussion about the heart of the plot: the virus. I think some basic background on the virus and its effects would have been appropriate, along with some explanation as to how the 1% of the population survived and why they have to live underground.<br/><br/>Also, it should have been revealed to the viewer what crimes James Cole was in prison for; I mean, he is the 'good guy' throughout the movie and it seems hard to reconcile that with what we're told in the beginning, that he has a history of violence.<br/><br/>All around, this is an utterly fantastic movie.

","This is exactly what you would expect of visionary Terry Gilliam.  A dark, humorous, moving film that will haunt you for a long time to come.<br/><br/>I don't need to review the storyline, it has been described elegantly by others.  Gilliam's sense of the ""technology-run-amok"" is present in this work (odd mix of obsolete with the fantastic, such as 1960s style television monitors linked with obtrusive magnifying glasses and microphones) and contribute to the paranoid feeling of the future landscape.  Bruce Willis' performance is nothing less than perfect: cold, lonely, beaten yet hopeful. Brad Pitt's performance is a show-stopper, as an off-kilter schizophrenic. Madeline Stowe plays an intelligent and extremely sexy psychologist who slowly comes to realize that Willis is not a lunatic, but truly a man of the future.<br/><br/>The most haunting scene is when Willis tearfully listens to Louis Armstrong's ""It's a Wonderful World"".  You can literally feel Willis' torment, as you ride along on his knowledge of the future's bleakness, and the recognition of how mankind had destroyed such a beautiful earth.<br/><br/>Haunting, darkly humorous, and ultimately memorable."

","From reading the comments on this site, it seems like you either love or hate this film, and for that reason alone it's worth watching!!  I, for one, loved it: I've never been a fan of Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt or sci-fi fantasy films but this movie transformed my opinion of all three.<br/><br/>The plot is complex and requires a great deal of concentration; don't be surprised if you find yourself repeatedly thinking 'What the hell is going on?' during the first half of the film.  But there's never a dull moment and the dream sequence alone is enough to sustain interest.  Each time you watch it, you pick up on something new, such as the parallels between Cole's 'past' and 'present'; the detail in the film is what makes it so special. The acting is great all-round; Bruce Willis is brilliant as James Cole, a man battling with insanity as he travels through time in an attempt to save the human race from annihilation.  Brad Pitt is disturbingly hilarious as the deranged leader of the 'Army of the Twelve Monkeys' but gets some of the best lines of the film: 'Wiping out the human race?  That's a great idea, it's great, but more of a long-term thing; first we have to focus on more immediate goals.'  Last but definitely not least is Madeleine Stowe, an underrated actress who surely puts in one of the finest performances of her career here as Kathryn Railly, Cole's psychiatrist  who is forced into questioning her rational outlook on life.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have about 'Twelve Monkeys' is the music which can occasionally be rather irritating, taking on a cartoon-like quality which ruins the scene it accompanies (eg. when Kathryn attacks James after he's locked her in the boot of the car).  Nevertheless, this has got to be one of my favourite-ever films and the tragic, moving end sequence is simply beautiful."

","Gilliam made this after the flop of Baron Munchausen, and had to work with a smaller budget than for some of his earlier movies.  I think it forced him to focus on the characters rather than the effects, and the result is a brilliant psychological drama about a man whose personal ghosts mirror the ghosts of a plague-ravaged future Earth.<br/><br/>If you thought Bruce Willis was a lightweight (and Alan Rickman carried Die Hard), then take a look at this.  I completely reevaluated my opinion of Willis after seeing this movie.  Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt are also very good, but it's Willis who carries the focus of the film.<br/><br/>Yet another reminder that even with a science fiction / end-of-the-world / time travel story, good characters and good script writing (and decent direction) are all-important.  I suspect that this would not have been half as interesting had Gilliam had a big SFX budget.  If you are interested in another intelligent well-acted (low-budget) end-of-the-world story, see Val Guest's ""The Day the Earth Caught Fire"" (1961).<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies, and my favorite Gilliam movie."
"apoclypze0","Null","0","0","27 April 2000"," Good Film, Great Ending
","The most important act in any movie is the third act.  It leaves the audience with their final impressions of the film, and it ties everything together that the film has been building up to.  There are many decent thrillers that have awful third acts; hence the whole movie is tainted and the audience leaves with a bad view of the film.  ""12 Monkeys"" is not one of those films.  The beginning and middle of ""12 Monkeys"" are satisfactory, but not great.  It is in the last 20 or 30 minutes that the film picks up pace and begins to tie everything together.  The script is very sparse with details -- which leaves many in a state of confusion during most of the movie.  But in the end, when you begin to piece everything together, the film becomes amazingly good.  I would have to say the last five to ten minutes of the film contains the best ending/payoff that I have ever witnessed (much better than that other Bruce Willis film, ""The Sixth Sense"").  The concept behind the scene at the end that ties everything together is completely trippy, and very original and thought-provoking. Without the incredible third act, I probably wouldn't have liked this film as much as I did. Highly Recommended."

It is without a doubt Bruce Willis's best movie to date (yes, this film is *much* better than the overrated ""The Sixth Sense"") and Brad Pitt does one of his best performances -- it's actually quite interesting to see that some of the things that Jeffrey Goines (Pitt) says in this film might as well have come out of Tyler Durden's (Pitt's character in the masterpiece ""Fight Club"") mouth.

Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt establish themselves as serious actors in this film, and earn fresh respect for any previous misconceptions of their acting abilities.

So who in the end is the culprit. The sower of the seed, or the garden which made it grow. And what other themes are brilliantly investigated in this movie. The concept of the circle of time gets blown out of the water. History can't be changed. The fine line between sanity and insanity. The delicate balance between reality and what you want to believe.

I love it because of the past/future/present accuracy (most time-travel films are completely incongruous), because of its unpredictableness (you think things go great, then they don't, then they do again, then...), because they make you guess the meaning of the end of the film since its beginning and because you never know what's real (is Cole mad? which is the real world? who's the ""bad guy""?). The love story fits real well with it all. If you like this kind of film you should watch ""The Game"" (starring Michael Douglas)."

","I can't speak for anyone but ""Twelve Monkeys"" is certainly my all time personal favourite.<br/><br/>Liked aged wine, I get to savour new sights and sounds, each time I re-visit this warped, bittersweet mindtrip of a man named  James Cole. A man condemned for his love and longing for the 20th Century. A man whose pain is so heart felt, I can identify with his sorrows and empathise his suffering.<br/><br/>
His love for a time long gone and forgotten is made more poignant by his futile attempt to cling on to virtual shreds of those treasured moments(reflected in those dream like sequences).<br/><br/>The film succeed in painting his cursed predicament, an eternal life sentence to a re-incarnated deja vu, destined to plague him for eternity.<br/><br/>James Cole is a victim trapped in his own hell. He is a lost soul soaked in nostalgic sweat for an era forgotten and inflicted by a longing pain for a time lost forever.<br/><br/>Poetically sad, and lyrically moving, 12 Monkeys has slowly but surely captured my heart. James Cole mentioned somewhere in the film, that a movie may not be same the next time you see it as you are different. With the passage of time, one is blessed with more knowledge and experience, and this alters one's personality and perspective. So how I will feel about this film 5 years down the road?<br/><br/>Afraid I don't know the answer yet. But for now, this classic sure tops my list and I want to share it with anyone who care a read. I will be posting some more of my thoughts on this exceptional film the next time round. So for all you lonely souls out there, watch this space....<br/><br/>Sinnerman Age: 23"

","Properly speaking this should be called ""The Army of the Twelve Monkeys."" It only takes twelve, strategically placed throughout the world, to kill five billion people with a mutant virus. (Actually glass canisters are used.)<br/><br/>The central character, James Cole, played with heavyweight restraint by Bruce Willis, is a convict from the future where the survivors live underground, leaving the surface to the animals. He and other nonconformists live in cages and are made to ""volunteer"" to go back in time to search for the original virus before it mutated in 1996. Problem is they keep getting the destination year screwed up. Once they send him to 1917 and land him naked in the middle of a battle from World War I, where he gets shot in the leg. Another time they send him to 1990 where he ends up in a mental institution and meets attractive co-star Madeleine Stowe, who plays psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly, leading to an interesting subplot: shrink falls in love with her mentally disturbed patient. Brad Pitt entertains as Jeffrey Goines, a hyperactive nut case, son of a sick virologist, and leader of an animal rights activist group. He is crazy/wise.<br/><br/>The film is heavily populated by unfeeling, semi-competent scientists, mental patients and their caretakers. There are all sorts of apocalyptic fools ranting and raving about the end of the world, etc. Most of human society as we know it is in shadow, off camera. There's an understandable terror of psychoactive drugs among the patients. Thorazine in particular is mentioned. Cole's body is continually being assaulted by hypodermics, electrodes, the fists and boots of the guards and other hard objects. His face is continually smeared with blood. One gets the idea that director Terry Gilliam had a bad dream and wanted to share.<br/><br/>Regardless, this brooding, atmospheric yarn is the best cinematic sci-fi I have seen since Blade Runner (1982); and it is no co-incidence that it was scripted in part by the gifted David Peoples who helped write the screen play for Blade Runner. Never mind that time travel to the past is an absurdity. We're forced to rise above that because Gilliam presents time similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut did in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), namely that all time is happening ""simultaneously"" and especially right now, forever.<br/><br/>We are reminded that time is an illusion. Our experience and perception of time is, as it were, linear, allowing us a comprehension of ""time"" similar to what two-dimensional creatures might have of three dimensional space. ""Time"" does not exist. It is a construct from the way we compare events. Notice that when James Cole dies Dr. Railly is not sad because Cole lives on in the person of his younger self, the child at the airport watching his death. This will be the case for eternity. <br/><br/>There are some funny bits in the script. After Cole beats up the pimp to save Dr. Railly, and forces a trade of teeth (to evade the trackers implanted in his teeth), and the cops come, the pimp says, all hurt, ""I was attacked by a coked-up whore and a crazy dentist."" Another nice touch is to have the virologist father of crazy/visionary Jeffrey Goines sound like a southern politician instead of your usual mad scientist. I also liked it when psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly said, ""Psychiatry is the latest religion...I'm in trouble. I'm losing my faith."" She's right: psychiatry and clinical psychology in general is a secular religion less than two hundred years old that we as a society ought to regard with suspicion.<br/><br/>In short this is not your usual Bruce Willis outing. The action/adventure stuff is secondary to story and character development and to the social and political statements of the film, the more important of which is to protest the suppression of the individual by the larger society. The forces of evil really are those who dictate what is normal and those who enforce conformity. This film is commercially successful because many young people, corporate cogs, and the underclass feel oppressed by the constraints of society and can readily identify with Cole's struggle. What is worse, Thorazine and Prozac or marijuana and beer? Anyone who identified even in the slightest with this film can answer that question.<br/><br/>The second statement is that humans are ruining the planet and should be killed to save the animals. This melancholy idea is not so far-fetched. That some cult of nuts (or visionaries, as you like) might someday infect humanity with a deadly virus so that the flora and fauna of the planet might resume their natural state is at least plausible.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","[ Editor:  SPOILER ALERT.  This comment contains what can considered spoilers]<br/><br/>One of the pleasures of working on films for the ""after-markets"" is in being able to look at them over and over again. On beautifully crafted films like ""12 Monkeys,"" it is rewarding each time I see it.<br/><br/>One of the remarkable things about this particular film is that Madeline Stowe's character and Bruce Willis' character, in a sense, exchange identities. <br/><br/>Willis' character, Cole, is sent back in time to find out how a deadly virus is to be released, and meets Stowe's character, Reilly, who is a psychiatrist and a researcher. She's convinced he's insane, but knows she's met him before. Cole, having come from a penal colony that lives underground, adores the freedoms his time-travel allows him,and desperately wants to stay with Reilly, who lives above ground. Cole believes that Reilly can make him whole, can cure him of the rootlessness that time-travel has created within him, and concedes that she must be right. He must be insane.<br/><br/>When he explains his mission to her, she, of course, thinks he's nuts. But as they spend time together, she becomes aware that he knows things that only someone from the future would know. But how did he get a World War I bullet in his leg? And how does he know about the ""Army of the 12 Monkeys?"" She remembers seeing his face in a photograph from 75 years earlier...<br/><br/>When she calls his bluff and makes a phone call to a voice-mail machine that collects messages for the ""scientists of the future,"" she thinks that it's Cole's insane delusion. All she hears is an answering machine for a carpet cleaning company. Her clinical instincts are confirmed. Cole is nuts. Her grasp on the situation is secure. <br/><br/>But, in a brilliantly played twist, when she reports back to Cole, who has been waiting on the street, Cole recites back everything she's said--word for word, finally convincing her that he is not of this world. Both Reilly's clinical rationalism, and Cole's desperate desire to feign insanity so as to stay with her, are both shattered. She joins him in what to her must be insanity. Instead, they have to face the central issue.<br/><br/>The worst imaginable disasters can happen simply because individuals have free will. Rationalism falls apart."

","The main reason i realy like this movie, it´s because somehow it doesn´t feel like a regular sci-fi overproduced hollywood product. Just because it has a great story. Each time i see this, it seems like i´ve just read a very good sci-fi novel, instead of simply watching a movie.<br/><br/>12 MONKEYS, has probably the best time travel story i´ve seen in a movie so far. It´s less complex than it seems at first, but it manages to keep us interested right up untill the final moments. Altough the ending is very easy to guess, right at the begining of the movie. But this is only if you are someone who has read many science fiction through out the years. If you did, your mind will start thinking on possibilities and time-travel clichés the moment this movie starts. And there is a great possibility you´ll guess everything right away. But that´s another way of watching this story, i guess, because it´s great to think about it while we are watching it, an dtry to form our own conclusions. And this story is filled with small details.<br/><br/>So if you are just a regular ""hollywoodian"" movie goer, and don´t like to think much at the movies, stay away from 12 MONKEYS, because chances are you´ll probably won´t like it. But if you like sience fiction, go right ahead, because this one of the best sci-fi in the 90´s.<br/><br/>Visualy it´s fantastic, with a very original production design, wich make everything look like as if it was taken from an european graphic novel, or BD or comics, whatever you want to call it. The scenes set in the future are just excelent, with a very claustrophobic feel, even when they are set on open spaces sometimes. We realy can feel that the world has come to an end, and this adds a great atmosphere to the scenes set in the present, because we have already seen how the future looks like.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Brad Pit do an incredible job in this movie, an dwe can never choose wich one we admire the most, altough Brad Pit playing a schizofrenic mad man, is totaly convincing and he´s one of the main reasons to watch 12 MONKEYS even if you don´t like sci-fi.<br/><br/>I don´t know what else to say, without revealing the plot, so i won´t say nothing more, except you have to see this movie. Just watch it alone or with someone who has  also never seen it. Try to watch it without knowing to much about it and you´ll love it much more.

","There are loads of reviews of ""Twelve Monkeys"" that say it's a fantastic film, and it's undoubtedly one of the finest examples of moviemaking, and that it has enough special qualities to separate it from the other merely 'good' films the world has to offer.  This ain't one of those reviews.  It's not that I disbelieve people when they say they love it - and the film offers superb performances (particularly from Brad Pitt), a wonderful visual style and exactly the right sort of direction (from a very talented Mr. Gilliam) for the movie.  Everything fits together very nicely indeed.  But personally, I just found it lacking in...  Oh blast, I don't know.  I'm human.<br/><br/>Having said that, the positive points of the film (in addition to those already mentioned) seem to leap out at hit one smack in the face: inspired camerawork, thrilling storyline, nice soundtrack, a keep-you-guessing plot... all the elements are there.  I think I wanted something more from the movie, though - I wanted a certain sense of wonder, that I get from the end of movies like ""Cinema Paradiso"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Casablanca"", ""Stand By Me"" and so on.  Maybe that's greedy.  ""Twelve Monkeys"" interested me - it interested me a great deal, but I wasn't inspired.<br/><br/>The bits I particularly liked were the clever Hitchcock references and the way the society appeared to respond to 'madness'.  It's clear that Terry Gilliam knows his subject.  It's also interesting to compare the film to his earlier work, ""The Fisher King"", for both films share a fascination with society's underworld: the beggars, the homeless, the 'mad'.  It appears that these people have important things to say (at least as many important things to say as the rich, the housed and the 'sane') - and they have more freedom to say what they feel.  The thing is, nobody seems to listen.<br/><br/>I could pretentiously twaddle on about this film forever, skirting round the issue of why it just didn't grab me as well as it might, but perhaps it's just me - a personal viewpoint.  As James Cole (played with great flair by Bruce Willis) points out, it is our opinions on movies that change, not the movies themselves.  I'll perhaps watch it again and love it.  If my opinions change, keep an eye out here, and I'll write another review.<br/><br/>I found ""Twelve Monkeys"" to be visually stunning, wonderfully acted, and quite compelling viewing - but it lacked the 'something' (whatever the hell THAT is - and if you find out, you'd make movies that would be the envy of the world) that makes the movie (for me) a great, great film.  Harsh, yes. But it's a good film that can stand a little criticism."

","Terry Gilliam. Time Bandits, Monty Phiton, Life of Brian Different film-making, almost revolutionary. With Twelve Monkeys he achieves three fantastic things: a) a great movie; b) a great science-fiction movie and, c) he extracted from Bruce Willis a very good performance, his best to date.<br/><br/>Alternate realities and time-travel have always been the focus of written science-fiction since Jules Verne and H. G. Welles. Many authors have produced stories that leave a long lasting impression on the minds of those who read them. So, every time someone dares to make a movie using the element of time-travel (or alternate realities), he/she runs the risk of being anything but original. But Terry Gilliam picked a story from a French director, used it, transformed it to his liking andvoilá, Twelve Monleys.<br/><br/>The acting is good, whether you´re looking at Willis, or Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. The plot is excellent, although nothing tremendously original.<br/><br/>WARNING: SOME OF THE NEXT WORDS MAY CONSTITUTE SPOILERS. WARNING: SOME OF THE NEXT WORDS MAY CONSTITUTE SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Gillian created a post-apocalypse world that is horrible to contemplate, but very possible to come true. Making his character go back to the past, not knowing where he is going to end up, what society he will be put against, going through the trial and error task of getting to the exact point in time where the character should be in order to stop the ultimate cataclism, Gillian shows us the terrifying `reality' behind time travel, the risks involved in it, the possibility of a traveler going mad over it.<br/><br/>You feel sorry for Bruce´s character, you go side by side with him in his struggle to leave the lunatics hospital and finally his struggle to stop the menace.<br/><br/>There is mystery, strange discoveries, the skepticism of Stowe´s character, the dizziness in Willis´character´s struggles, a larger than life issue at stake (the salvation of mankind and the future), sacrifices and as usual, the irritating paradox of why would anyone try to remake the past (for whatever reason) when he/she would cease to exist as the person who fears and suffers and wants to change something<br/><br/>This movie does make one think about life, sacrifices, today´s madness, altruismIt´s dark, it does not offer hope, only despair and sadness, and brings many questions to life. It´s frightening, mad, and holds your attention from the beginning. But you do have to have an open mind and hope for the worst (in the story). Great movie.

Brad Pitt is superb as the m-m-mad son-of-a-biologist: he creates a totally believable set of speech and hand-movement tics, and manages to be funny and sympathetic.<br/><br/>The switch two-thirds of the way in when Madelaine Stowe starts to believe that Bruce Willis is sane, but he becomes convinced that he's crazy provides extra impetus to keep us thinking (remember when you used to do that while watching a film?) and propel us towards the finale.<br/><br/>The ending is thoroughly satisfying, Gilliam's visuals are spot-on (as usual) and the viewer is treated like an adult (hoorah!)."

","Director Terry Gilliam craftily captures the essence of film art by manipulating our understanding of space and time.  He rearranges our preconceived notions of linear time with the use of temporal distortions in both the cinematography and script.  In a future noir world about a group of scientists attempting to cure themselves of a deadly disease, one man becomes a time traveling ""document retrieval"" agent.  Thrust through the boundaries of history, James Cole (Bruce Willis) must locate the origin of the virulent disease that wipes out 90% of humanity. Along the way, Cole encounters resistance and support in varying forms.  Yet, during the entire time he is shoved through, almost experimentally, the framework of time and space until his emotional strain forces him to renege his investigative role, Cole slowly discovers who made the virus and where it originated. ..so he thinks.  Cole tracks down the leader of the Army of Twelve Monkeys, Jeffrey Goins (Brad Pitt), thinking that his group is responsible for the dispersing of the virus.  Much to Cole's surprise the Army of Twelve Monkeys is harmless and the real culprit is found elsewhere. Amazingly enough, Gilliam is able to fuse the cinematography with the script to impose a heightened awareness of space and time.  According to the movie, space and time are just moments that can be entered and exited anytime, anywhere, by the same person with the same age or the same person at different ages who may face each other as the 30 year old James Cole and the 10 year old James Cole.  Ultimately saying that James Cole will continue to live this life indefinitely:  Cole watches his own death at age 10 and, at age 30, watches himself at age 10 watch his own death.

Even minor characters step into frame fully developed, to the extent that a line like, ""I'm Jones.  Insurance,"" is packed with meaning.  On top of it all, and what makes this an even more impressive work, is that Gilliam was absolutely faithful to the script.

","One of my favorite films of all time is Chris Marker's LA JETTE.  In half an hour and in french, that one movie did more to refine my ideas and understanding of science fiction than almost anything else to date has. This, of course, colored my view of Terry Gilliam's very disappointing 12 Monkeys.  I have to say that for anyone who can sit down and watch both films, there is little room for comparison.  The script for 12 Monkeys was surprisingly good, but what ruined it was the way that Terry Gilliam handled it.<br/><br/>Usually, Gilliam's parabolic treatment and direction fits in well with silly or comic works like ""Time Bandits"", ""Brazil"", ""The Fisher King"". These are all films that I really love, but what I don't understand is how Gilliam's direction in the film is how he never bothered to try and make the audience believe that the protagonist might actually be imagining any of his experience, which is what the script is all about.  Gilliam seems more interested in the visual gadgets and silly images he can create- like the gigantic, ridiculous ball that the scientists question him through, or the dizzying views of a mental hospital, seen through a fisheye lens.  One of the most important moments- when Bruce Willis bursts in on a patient entering an MRI machine that looks strangely like the time travel device he entered- falls completely flat, since it is shot in a completely subdued, flattened manner.  Gilliam must have dropped his fisheye lens on the floor.<br/><br/>For anyone even vaguely intrigued by 12 Monkeys (as I most likely would have been, had I not seen LA JETTE), please do check out LA JETTE at your local video store (yes, even Blockbuster Video has it).

One way of doing this is by sending him back through time to get more information.<br/><br/>There is one mistake I think in the time travel element of the movie: when Kathryn makes her phone call to the future, the content of that call is already known to Cole, who has had it played back to him. But a second call, that he himself makes later on in the movie, hasn't been received in the future until he makes the actual call. This seemed inconsistent in an otherwise very solid plot. The acting was reasonable but not amazing, I thought Brad Pitt wasn't that convincing, but the performance of Bruce Willis and most of all one particular red-haired man really impressed me.<br/><br/>Oh but forget about this chatter and go see the movie - it's a masterpiece."

This movie deals with many interesting aspects that appeal to me; time travel, animal preservation, insanity and epidemics.

""12 monkeys"" provides Great performances by the likes of Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe, a plot that will keep you guessing, and some very atmospheric background music.<br/><br/>I especially like movies presented the way ""12 monkeys"" is, ones that feed the plot to us in fragments, and only achieve total unity when the film is complete, not unlike ""the Usual Suspects"".

","""Twelve Monkeys"" is an engaging foray into the possibility of a non-nuclear apocalypse, an armaggedon caused by the release of a killer virus.  These kind of apocalyptic movies, contagious virus or otherwise, were all the rage in the mid-90s, and where others such as ""Deep Impact"" or ""Outbreak"" failed, ""Twelve Monkeys"" can be considered a triumph.  Plot loopholes and lapses in effective pacing aside, the film is a strong effort from Monty Python illustrator and cult favourite director Terry Gilliam.<br/><br/>Any film with Bruce Willis as the lead can often make or break a movie. Some are drawn to his machismo and semblances of 'aura' for want of a better word, while others are put off by his near-complete lack of range or cocky attitude.  It is fair to say I am caught between both camps.  I admire Willis' self-assurance but feel he is drastically over-rated.  He stars as James Cole, a man born in the pre-apocalyptic world, living in the post-apocalyptic underground.  Seeking a pardon from past crimes, Cole wishes to return to 1996 via time travel to find a cure for the virus in present (2021 as it is to him) day.  By locating the scientist who created the virus in the past he will find out how to cure the people of the future.<br/><br/>Only animals have survived the apocalypse, while humans have been forced to live underground.  In a chilling scene Willis' character, dressed in an elaborate spacesuit, explores the upper world.  As he walks through what was once Philadelphia he comes across giant bears and lions.  Once again beasts rule the earth.  It's Darwinism in reverse and what is even more scary is the impact man has had on the world.  Not only has he forever changed the face of the natural planet, but he has even managed to conjure up his own destruction.<br/><br/>Cole is sent back through time to 1996, only he arrives at his destination six years earlier.  Arrested and thrown into a mental institution, Cole is drugged to the eyeballs.  Would you believe someone who said they were from the future and were warning you of an impending killer virus?   Whilst in the institution he meets Jeffery Goines (Brad Pitt), a complete nutball who hails from a privileged background.  The two begin to talk and Cole's desperate mission continues to go awry.  A psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is assigned to Cole's case.  She is drawn further into Cole's story, to the point where she becomes his hostage as he desperately tries to locate a cure for the disease.<br/><br/>The film's best scenes occur in the future.  Gilliam's set design is at once trash-metal and chic.  The costume design is a highlight, the spacesuit -- all clear plastic and balloon-ish tubing -- stands out.  Gilliam's erratic camerawork is sometimes annoying, he tries a little too hard on capturing the madness of the asylum.  The performances are strong, if a little overdone.  Willis' best work often comes through in action movies.  His best scene comes after an arrest.  Drooling, chained to the floor and pumped with tranquilisers, Willis is more the madman than Pitt is in the entire movie. Pitt's performance, initially interesting, gets tiresome.  He's too manic, yet at the same time too coherent.  While he was Oscar nominated for this role, his work as the more subdued maniac Tyler Duerden in ""Fight Club"" is his best.  Stowe, an excellent character actress, is convincing as the shrink trying to help Cole, but she falters when the tempo is increased.<br/><br/>""Twelve Monkeys"" draws on some excellent points concerning science, the environment, selective memory and our perceptions of the truth.  Its basic story treads very familiar ground, but its quality of production and determined manic feel from its director allow it to stand above its competitors.  Interesting, compelling and entertaining, ""Twelve Monkeys"" proves you can make an old idea work when you treat it in an original manner."

","Before I begin, I would like to clear up something...I don't particularly think Bruce Willis is a Great Actor...he makes great, fun, and very entertaining films, but his acting has never been great (save ""Pulp Fiction""), at least until now.  James Cole (Willis) is from one of Terry Gilliam's horrifying future images, where the only remaining people on the planet live underground to avoid the plague that has wiped out most of the population.  He is sent back in time to discover a cure for this virus, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe), and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), and the race for the future has begun.  With great acting from Pitt, Willis, and Stowe this story comes alive with terrifying realism, and frightening visions of the future of the human race....not to mention the finely developed romance between Railly, and Cole which is authenticly done, as opposed to a cheesy goo-goo film fling.  Gilliam's eye for detail, and his vision of futuristic horrors is crystal clear, as always, and takes the viewer into a realm of planetary biological terrorism that stares down at us like a Queen Alien in her hive."

","Until fairly recently Terry Gilliam's 1995 movie might have been viewed as unduly apocalyptic and pessimistic. But post-September 11, the film's vision of Armageddon (and oblivion for most of us), followed, for those that remain, by a beleaguered existence in a soul-less society dominated by technology, seems less a nightmarish prophecy and more a sober forecast.<br/><br/>
Bruce Willis delivers a powerful performance as James Cole, a violent convict, time-transported back from about 2030 to the 1990s, in order to discover the precise origins of a virus which destroyed most of the world's population in 1996. Because of the time-shifts, the inclusion of some dream sequences, and the complexity of Gilliam's vast and detailed sets, the narrative isn't easy to follow initially, but it falls into place as it progresses towards an enigmatic close. Among the more conventional aspects of the film are glamour and love interest provided by Madeleine Stowe as a psychiatrist, a road sequence when Cole goes on the run, and a suspenseful ending. The director even plays with us at one point, leaving us guessing about the action, à la Hitchcock. <br/><br/>But intertwined with this main plot are other themes, especially that of the confusion between madness and sanity in an increasingly insane world. Central here is Brad Pitt - pouring out words and pointing his fingers like daggers - as Jeffrey Goines, the disturbed son of a world-famous scientist (Christopher Plummer) who is developing the fateful virus (for reasons I didn't catch, but which are probably just as valid as the USA's development of anthrax spores). Who is more mad - Jeffrey or his acclaimed father? The issues of ecology, consumerism and the dominance of the media are also touched on. Among various religious themes and references, it is probably not too fanciful to identify Cole as a Christ-figure - with appropriate initials - sent down to save the world, but whose warnings are as little heeded as those of the original.<br/><br/>But despite the wealth of ideas in the movie, seeing it is above all an astonishing visual experience. Most of the images are bleak and disturbing - with little to choose between those set in the present day and those in the future - but they have a surreal beauty. The image of central Baltimore, deserted by humans, and taken over by animals is especially haunting."

","Terry Gilliam has made many fine films over the years. For my money. he's one of the best directors in the world - a film-maker who has been cursed by some bad luck since he made his directorial debut with Monty Python and The Holy Grail in 1975.<br/><br/>Made for a few thousand quid, he and co-director Terry Jones proved they could make an hilarious comedy which looked like it cost ten times the budget. <br/><br/>Gilliam broke off to make Jabberwocky in 1977 and although not a huge commercial or critical success, it does boast some inventive visuals. By 1981, he delivered a trilogy of movies which would span the dizzy heights of blockbuster (Time Bandits), the unchartered waters of a film-maker taking on Hollywood and winning (Brazil) and the glorious flop that was The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.<br/><br/>The hedonistic excesses of the Eighties were naturally followed by a worldwide recession and the feeling of redemption for over spending was never more apparent than in Hollywood.<br/><br/>If one side of the coin was the absurdly expensive Munchausen, then Gilliam sought to make amends with The Fisher King.<br/><br/>That 1991 classic saw Gilliam back on blockbusting form as had been the case 10 years earlier. Surely his next big hit was just around the corner.<br/><br/>Er, not quite.<br/><br/>It was five years until Gilliam followed it up with one of the best films of 1996.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is a bleak, stunning take on Chris Marker's 1962 photo roman film, La Jetee. What's a photo roman? Basically a series of still photos presented in film form. David Peoples, one of the brains behind Blade Runner and Unforgiven had used that as a springboard for his screenplay co-written with wife Janet.<br/><br/>They developed a script about a convict from the future living in an underground society. Hired by a bunch of scientists to go back in time and discover the source of the virus which wiped out much of mankind, through some cock up in their calculations, he bounces around time periods like a silver ball bouncing off the bumpers of a pinball machine.<br/><br/>So basically it's a dirtier version of Back to the Future, but what makes this far more impressive is its mind bending script and three knockout performances from its cast.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is superb as the manic rich man's son who takes doomed time traveller Cole (Bruce Willis) under his wing. The darkly glamorous Madeleine Stowe adds just the right degree of intelligent sexiness to make this a must for the film goer who likes their leading lady with brains and beauty.<br/><br/>The movie was made for a fraction of most films in 1996 but thanks to Gilliam's bizarre sense of aesthetics and some superb support from the likes of Jeffrey Beercroft, it looks like it cost a lot more than it did.."

","When Terry Gilliam (director) got the results back from the first test screenings of '12 Monkeys' he became worried that he had created a major flop and repeated the misfortunes that befell 'The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen'. What he later discovered was that the audiences at the screenings were too narrow-minded to appreciate the brilliance of what later became a very successful film. The main problem was that it was something they had never seen before and it confused them.<br/><br/>The film depicts a dark and scary world of maniacs and distruction, yet has an underlying message of hope. Not perhaps for the material world which is inevitably wiped out, but for humanity. Bruce Willis, in one of his best performances, plays a man from the future who is sent back to 1996 to prevent the release of a virus that all but destroys the human race. Although not sure what is reality and what is delusion within his confused mind, he struggles on to save the world.<br/><br/>The film is full of ambiguities: the imagery of decay yet has a certain beauty to it; the ending is the most depressing and yet heartening that i have experienced in cinema. The result is an emotional experience that leaves you all ""over the shop"" mentally.

","Mild SPOILERS <br/><br/>Gilliam's dark and somewhat twisted look at the notion of a killer virus that has wiped out most of the world population is a surreal, opaque and troubling film, filled with odd characterizations and memorable images that carry the film above any other nineties thriller. The story concerns Cole (Willis, in probably his second best performance), a man from the future picked at random to go into the past and try to stop the virus from ever being invented. Willis gives Cole a warm humanity, even though we are supposed to view him as a single-minded brute, just as the scientists of the future view him, his performance is vital for giving Cole the layers he needs to give the film more reality. <br/><br/>Any one familiar with Gilliam's work will know of the almost satirical tone that has been present in all of his films, but with Twelve Monkeys it seems to have gone AWOL, this gives Gilliam's images more of a weight and significance, no more are they the empty cartoon frolics of Monty Python or Time Bandits... We are forced to take everything as it is depicted, and this helps give the film more impact. The plot and story twists and turns never letting us predict the outcome, we're as much in the dark as the characters themselves... <br/><br/>The downside of the film however is that at times it tries to say too much, taking it's ecological aspects way too far with Pitt's band of rogue Eco terrorists... The film works much better as a fantasy, dealing - as all Gilliam's films do, with the subject of mental illness.

Cole, a futuristic time traveller played by Willis, must go back in time to unravel the events surrounding the rise of the plague so that scientists in the future can attempt to set things right (put human beings back on top, so to speak). The plot sets up a wonderful mystery to figure out, as well as creates an interesting morality play regarding the place of human beings on the planet. Are we destroying the Earth with our consumeristic, growth based economy? Is our culture sustainable in the long term? What fate awaits the human race?<br/><br/>There's also an interesting dynamic between Cole and the ""modern day"" therapist played by Stowe--they are both forced to question their sanity, which creates an intriguing ambiguity for the audience and the unusual and shocking conditions that create a somewhat plausible possibility of romance for the characters. It's all good stuff.<br/><br/>The acting is great--Willis, Stowe, and Pitt all play their parts to a tee, and as mentioned, the story is rich in every way. This movie makes you think while you're being highly entertained, and to me that's what it's all about.<br/><br/>Too bad about the crazy costumes..."

","Twelve Monkey's is a sci-fi thriller about a world that has been destroyed by a virus and a convict sent back in time to 1996 to stop it, or at least provide lots of information.  The movie requires you to do two things, first sit and watch (you cannot watch bits and pieces and pick up the entire story)and second, THINK. Neither is a skill of most video/DVD watchers. Willis and Pitt are good and Stowe does a nice job as well.  Still, the ending of the movie left me unsatisfied and questioning if Willis' life is just a continues loop...see himself killed, live through global pleague, and try to solve problem. I would recommend the flick, but not the best thing I have ever seen."

","Never have I seen a film so strange. It's good, but very strange. Brad Pitt was top notch and so was Willis. I never really have cared for Madeleine Stowe but she was in it. I just bought the DVD so I got to watch the Behind the scenes thingy. The thing that I like most about the film is that it is so original. It's not your average action film, and it is not your average science fiction film. I think they did a really good job for the budget they had. I can't believe Battlefield Earth got a 70 million dollar budget and director Terry Gilliam had to fight to get a 29 million dollar budget. This is an excellent film see it at all costs. And if you normally like strange films you should probably end up buying this one. It's a keeper."

","This is a really good, underrated movie. I felt it was very similar in many respects to David Fincher's works (specially Fight Club): although the theme in itself is not even similar, both share gloomy visions of our future because of our present. Even more, both films look as if they had been purposely treated to look incredibly ugly on screen (which, btw, is not a bad thing when you consider the plot).<br/><br/>The plot? Well, humanity was wiped off the surface of the earth, and doomed to live underground. Before you start harvesting thoughts of ""Battlefield Earth"", STOP! The plot is just an excuse for an incredibly complex story, which, if you are not paying attention, might not be clear to you the first time you watch the film. As a matter of fact, watching the film twice, or three times, will demonstrate all the possibilities of the story (which are many, and all powerful).<br/><br/>I might be wrong, but I think this film was also Bruce Willis' first ""serious"" movie. He is the ""hero"" (if the word fits his persona) of the movie. Paired with Brad Pitt, in a stunning role as a psychotic man, both guys deliver quite a performance. Pitt, in particular, avoids the ""pretty boy"" persona he seemed to have cultivated up to that point, and delivered a stunning rendition of a mad mastermind. He might be called the ""villain"" of the movie. He is, but *not quite*. Everything in this picture, actually, is *not quite* it seems.<br/><br/>Add to this a very good surround mix, and you have yourself a winner, what might have been the most underrated film of 1995."

","The unlikely combination of Bruce Willis in a Terry Gilliam film turns out to be the best thing either of them has ever done.  I've never been a big fan of Bruce Willis' action movies, but he's at the top of his form as a reluctant time traveller / psychiatric patient.  Terry Gilliam, on the other hand, proves that he can make a fairly mainstream, psychological thriller while still imparting his cynically comical world view.<br/><br/>The structure of the movie, constantly switching between the supposed future, where Bruce Willis's character is a prisoner being forced to go back in time to find the origins of the virus that drove humans underground, and the present, where he is considered delusional for his belief that he is from the future, is expertly handled such that it's impossible to tell which is ""reality"".  Willis does a fantastic job capturing the despair he feels as he becomes increasingly unsure of the truth and his own sanity.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is perfect -- the story, the acting, the direction, the scenery, the plot twists, and, especially, the ending.

Terry Gilliam does an excellent job of adapting the idea and building upon it in 12 Monkeys. In addition to giving us a riveting story, Gilliam also makes us look at our society from the perspective of a disastrous future, like reading about the Human race in a historical encyclopedia as if it was an extinct species.

Gilliam is a masterful diector, drawing superb performances out of Pitt, Stowe and Willis. Watch for Willis' expressions throughout the movie, but especially in the insane asylum.  Also for Pitt's over the top but still believable performance. There are some genuinely spooky ideas in this movie, and the soundtrack causes insanity when you can't get it out of your head.

"Chemical Switchboard","Null","0","0","10 March 2001"," Outline: 12 Monkeys
","Based on Chris Marker's (1962 French) short film ""La Jetée,"" a story told through still photos and voice-over narration, ""12 Monkeys"" is a very stylish movie with many artisticly-linked attributes (this not solely referring to the movie itself - which is very artistic in its own modern way, but rather, to objects within the movie).  One example of what I mean would have to be the influence of Lebbeus Woods' 1987 drawing ""Neomechanical Tower (Upper) Chamber,"" which obviously inspired the look of the chair in the year 2035.<br/><br/>Now before I actually get to the movie review itself, let me just give credit where credit is due.  First, to Terry Gilliam, director of this semi-sci-fi flick.  I mean, after directing such let downs (to me, anyways) as ""Brazil"" and ""Monty Python,"" this venture definitely brought you back into a good status quo with me.  Secondly, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Willis, usually a hideous actor (with the exception of two films: ""The Sixth Sense,"" and well, this one), gave a very unexpected, riveting performance. Pitt, on the other hand, is a great actor, in my opinion (with such movie titles as ""Se7en,"" ""Fight Club,"" and a movie in which he played himself in, ""Being John Malkovich,"" to his credit).  However, this movie, for which he earned a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination, by far, outdid any of those other ones.  So to both of you, congratulations!  And last but not least, credit is also due to screenwriters David Peoples, and his wife, Janet, who took Chris Marker's evocative film and enriched it with their own stirring vision of a future haunted by the past.<br/><br/>Now, as for the movie itself, it's interesting to say the least.  The year is 2035. Nearly 40 years earlier, a killer virus spared only 1% of the planet's population.<br/><br/>James Cole (Bruce Willis) plays a prison convict/time traveler from this dystopian future who ""volunteers"" to be sent back to 1996 in order to allow his virus-ravaged world to move back to the surface. He cannot change the events of his past.  But rather, all he has to do is bring back a pure sample of the virus so his people can overcome it and become the rulers of the planet.<br/><br/>However, time travel in the year 2035 isn't perfect yet (probably because they have ""ex-insurance agents"" in charge of it). The first time he is sent back, he ends up in the year 1990, where he is promptly put in an asylum. He then meets two of the people who play key roles in the destruction of the human life on this planet: his psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) and co-asylum inmate Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt).<br/><br/>The plot is set up so it looks as though Cole is responsible for Doomsday. His ramblings about the virus influences Goines' plans, once his father (the Nobel Prize-winning virologist whose lab coincidentally keeps an ample stock of the deadly virus at hand) gets him out of the asylum.  Goines then goes on to become the leader of the ""Army of the 12 Monkeys,"" who the people in 2035 believe are the ones responsible for unleashing the virus.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the scientists in Cole's future bring him back and have another go at putting him in the right year.  This time, after a couple of bumps (most notably one in WWI where Cole is shot in the leg), he ends up in the right year where he once again ends up with Railly and manages to convince her of his story.  However, Railly's psychiatry and the continuous time travel appears to have taken its toll on Cole, and when he is brought back to 2035 and sent back to 1996 again, he is convinced that he is just a mental patient with delusions about the future.  This time, however, Railly convinces him otherwise and together they try to stop the ""Army of the 12 Monkeys.<br/><br/>History can lie. Cole discovers this (in 1996) and passes this on to the ""future"" (2035) and becomes a hero.  At this point, there are numerous options to end the story after tying up the lose ends.  But the story is left very open-ended and the issue of whether there are more loops in the ""future"" and the question whether the ""past"" can really be changed is left unexplained and unanswered.<br/><br/>Viewers of this movie may recall a ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" episode where the Enterprise is caught in a time loop of destruction, and each time the crew travels back through time, they experience a deja vu sensation that finally allows them to break out of the destructive loop.  The memory Kathryn Railly experiences, that she has seen James Cole before, could be one such instance.  Thus, viewers who like happy endings may wish to imagine another loop where Railly and Cole actually manage to save the world.  Viewers who like complete endings may wish to imagine that the people in 2035 were eventually able to go back to the surface with Cole's help.  Cynical viewers may opt for an ending where nothing changes and everything the people in 2035 do, ends up being futile.<br/><br/>Finally, for those of you who are familiar with the Everett multiverse interpretation of quantum theory, each of the contradictory events in the movie could be happening in a different universe. For example, there may be a universe where Cole survives and lives happily everafter with Railly, one where Cole survives but is too late to stop the virus, and one where Cole is never sent back into time.<br/><br/>Moving on... if you pay close attention throughout the entire film, you will notice similarities between the ""past"" and ""future"" that can't all be explained as mere coincidences.  Examples of this, include: (1) James is a prisoner in the past and in the future.  (2) Five scientists sitting behind a long table send Cole off from the ""future"" to find the virus, while five psychiatrists sitting behind a long table in the ""present"" evaluate Cole's condition.  And finally, (3) the guards from the past (one Negro and one Caucasian) bathe Cole in an eerily similar way to that of the way that the guards bathed him in the future (also one Negro and one Caucasian).<br/><br/>What-may-or-may-not-be COLE'S VISION of the ""future"" looks flawed and twisted. The technology looks absurd and counter-productive (a metal ball of viewing screens?). The dialog of the scientists is... odd, to say the least.  Also, exotic animals are still alive and they've been roaming the streets of 2035 Philadelphia for the last 38 years.  Pay attention at the beginning and end of the movie and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>As for James' ""only"" dream, during the movie we are repeatedly reverted back to it.  This dream is the soul of the film.  Gilliam returns to it three times, adding more details until the dream links all the pieces in the puzzle, which includes the remarkable David Morse as a researcher with more than a passing interest in Kathryn.  Cole's confusing of illusion and reality screams Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ""Vertigo,"" in which a mentally unbalanced James Stewart tries to turn Kim Novak into a reincarnation of the woman he loves, who he believes has died.  In the spirit of irony, however, in one scene from ""12 Monkeys,"" Cole and Kathryn hide in a movie-revival house showing this very film.  The 1958 film, now yellowed with age, shows Novak in the Muir Woods using her finger to trace the small space on the rings of a cut redwood that encompasses the years of her life.  Bernard Herrmann's haunting ""Vertigo"" score plays over the dialog between Cole and Kathryn as they leave the theater in an attempt to carve out their own small space in life.  Rarely has one film referenced another with such poetic grace.<br/><br/>Much like ""Vertigo,"" ""12 Monkeys"" rewards multiple viewings. You might say it even demands them.  For all the fun, fright, and hypnotic romance that Gilliam delivers, he digs deepest into fatalistic themes that usually scare away the crowds at the box office. Go with Gilliam anyway. Solving the riddle of ""12 Monkeys"" is an exhilarating challenge.<br/><br/>And if after watching it numerous times, you still long for some uniqueness in your life... then check out its soundtrack.  The theme song for the movie is composed solely through the use of an accordion, something not often heard on movie soundtracks.<br/><br/>All in all, I would give the movie 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, and a 10 out of 10... thus, equalling a perfect rating.  Great stars + a relatively good director + a compelling story (with depth) + a multi-dimensional ending that can obviously be interpreted in many ways = ONE HELL OF A BLOCKBUSTER NIGHT!<br/><br/>Rent it, you won't regret it."
"famsmith","8","0","0","23 February 2001"," A film that transcends the genre.
","To call Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys a science fiction/fantasy film would be to call Stanley Kubrick's The Shining a horror film.  I have seen 12 Monkeys many times now and what strikes me about it more than anything else is how Gilliam uses cinematic means to reveal a character desperately trying to remember something as he is hurled back and forth in time, creating a very disoriented concept/construct of reality and making it even more difficult to recall his childhood memory which is the crux of the problem he desperately seeks to solve.  We are thrown straight into his hysteria and if we are to doubt his perception of reality we must doubt our own as they are one in the same, we are given no other option than to accept the character's reality.  I find it absolutely amazing that as wild and fantastic as this movie is I have a hard time viewing it as implausible and that is because it is told in such a magnificent fashion that it makes every moment, especially the end seem not only plausible but inevitable.  Not a frame is wasted. This film goes straight for your throat, it doesn't spend any time messing around.  It is one of the few films that has yet to exhaust me.  Gilliam does a great job (As he has in several other films.) of placing an object in the midst of an ocean of empty space.  Like many great noir filmmakers he understands how to use emptiness not merely as negative space, but as the most important space, the only difference being instead of creating the effect through lighting Gilliam manages his success through composition and the contents or lack thereof that he places within the context.  Though mention has been made of it this is one of the only times I have ever seen a director take full advantage of the empty space, and not by filling it but by allowing it to remain unoccupied by objects or subjects.  The relationships are intriguing to say the least and with this film Gilliam has taken yet another step towards distinguishing himself as a truly important and unique filmmaker.  This film is much more than a science fiction/fantasy film and is a perfect example of why some films should not be identified by genres at all."

","Several films have examined the classic form of the Greek Tragedy, but none with more sophistication than this and due mention to the Greek myth of Cassandra that drives such plots.   Although Bruce Willis is in classic ""detached man with an important mission"" mode, he shows why you've got to see him outside of an action film in order to gauge his worth as an actor. His restraint in the role of a man not quite sure whether the disaster he foresees is real or just a figment of his own mind helps to allow the viewer to wonder whether it all might be a dream.  During the movie, you have more faith in Bruce's mission than Bruce does.<br/><br/>In the end, like many movies of this type, including ones with happy endings (think ""Terminator 2"" or any of the many time travel episodes of Star Trek), you have to wonder whether prescience is actually something to be envied or whether knowing the outcome is actually enough to alter it.<br/><br/>In addition, Terry Gilliam is one of my favourite directors merely for the sense of style he gives to the cinematography.

The director Terry Gilliam however has brought the film brilliantly together, making a fairly complex syntagm visually stimulating and engaging.

","I have a lot to say about this film and I'll doubt I'll get it all out. Who would have thought Bruce Willis can act? I mean, he is always a very entertaining action hero- but despite all the kudos that went to the maniacal Brad Pitt for his role, it was Bruce as the lost, intense, quite possibly insane but vulnerable James Cole. They say you'll never forget your first time, and this is true for Twelve Monkeys, who wasn't caught up in the relentless, intense and fascinating plot that tightened up around the characters? Who's mind wasn't left shattered at it's finale? But this movie isn't to be discarded as a one time thrill ride, no, for as James Cole himself says while watching Vertigo- the film is different every time you watch it. Sometimes it is the funniest of comedies, sometimes a great tragedy, sometimes just breathlessly intense. And every time I watch it I appreciate the care and intelligence that has gone into every aspect of it. The script by David Peoples (and wife), who also wrote the perfect Blade Runner, is brilliantly structured, complex, but too much so, and peppered with great humour. Director Terry Gilliam is great at creating an intense paranoid, what-is-going-on-am-i-crazy world and without him the film could have been totally ruined. The acting, Brad Pitt, yes is entertaining, memorable and riveting, but he rips a lot off Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now. The real respect should be going to Madeline Stowe (subtle, but the more you watch her the better she gets) and Bruce Willis, who is absolutely brilliant. OK, time to shut up now, even though there is plenty more to say, if you haven't watched it, watch it, if you have and enjoyed it, buy it and watch it over and over, and if you didn't enjoy it... well... it's your loss."

","Twelve Monkeys tries to be an interesting movie, and it does have a few sound concepts, but overall this movie is just plain annoying.

Willis spends much of the first half drooling on himself, while Pitt rambles for hours on end with horrible acting. Throw in some random screaming insanity every few seconds, and you have the first hour of this movie. The worst part is the movie tries to capture a sense of desperateness, which amounts to nothing but people screaming at the top of their lungs at each other for long stretches of time. This movie is annoying, noisy, shallow, and way too hyper.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie does actually manage to work out a few interesting concepts, but it's far too little and far too late to save it. Note that I don't say the second half of the movie is good, because it isn't. Tacky wardrobe, cheap locations, bad camera angles and dramatic fuzzy scenes only make the movie that much worse.<br/><br/>This one isn't even worth watching on cable, save your time and spare yourself the hassle of listening to Pitt ramble and Willis try to be dramatic.

"fedor8","Null","3","9","22 January 2007"," Solid but hardly terrific.
","This futuristic mystery/thriller has a relatively solid first hour, then slips a little once it becomes just a thriller. That the ending wasn't going to be ""happy"" was to be expected from Gilliam - hint: ""Brazil"". But while ""Brazil""'s ending is emotionally powerful, this one is without a real high point, plus the film ends with the too-oft-heard Louis Armstrong tune.<br/><br/>As far as the logic is concerned in this complex film: the puzzle bits and pieces fit well, apart from a few huge coincidences. There is ""only"" one, big, logic problem: Willis indirectly caused the virus to spread by going back to the past to investigate it! As it turns out towards the end, Pitt didn't bring about the virus, BUT he indirectly helped by distracting the investigation of Stowe and Willis. Secondly, Stowe - having written books and given seminars on the end of the world - influenced the madman working in the laboratory to destroy the planet. Or did she? To what extent? This is open to argument.<br/><br/>There are other unanswered questions; was it a coincidence that young Willis was present at his own death as a grown-up at the airport, or did the scientists who sent Willis know about this little fact and send him for that reason (among other things)? At the end we find out that one of Willis's mates from the future got a new order - to kill Stowe, as she was indirectly responsible for the madman's success. But wasn't it too late at that point to correct the mistake by deciding to kill Stowe on the airport? By that time Stowe's murder wouldn't have changed anything. And didn't Willis anyway say in the first half of the movie that he didn't come back to stop the spread but to get a sample of the original virus-carrying monkeys? If he said that it was not possible to change the disaster then why did his bosses from the future order for Stowe's murder, thereby implying that they tried to change the past, i.e. the spread of the virus? Could it be that they lied to Willis, or did they just change their minds? In either case, why? Still, all in all, the logic could have been worse. Gilliam isn't as clever as he thinks he is  at least not clever enough to do a time-travel movie that makes complete sense.<br/><br/>Stowe and Willis do a decent job, but Pitt overacts in his role too much, for my taste. Just because you play a madman shouldn't mean that you should be waving about manically and uncontrollably all the time. Visually, I expected a bit more from Gilliam. Only some scenes from the future are visually good."

","Futuristic prisoner Bruce Willis (in a terrific performance) is bounced around in time in an attempt to find the origins of a horrific plague that nearly wiped out humanity. Terry Gilliam's crafty, canny, brainy thriller does take a good forty-five minutes to get cooking, but from that point on it is highly successful. I haven't been a big admirer of Madeleine Stowe's work (or maybe it's just her knack for picking terrible projects, like ""Bad Girls""); playing a psychiatrist who teams with Willis, she's strong and engaging here, giving her best performance ever. The picture attempts to continually elude perceptions through side-bars, a trick which doesn't always work, yet the movie is still quite amazing.

","I have a feeling there is a lot of substance in this film. I wish I could say I got it, but I didn't. Maybe I glanced away from the screen too often or something. The story seemed to meander around through time and space and maybe one or two other dimensions known only to the director, Terry Gilliam. (By the way, it's anything but funny.) <br/><br/>Bruce Willis is sent back from the future, as in ""The Terminator,"" but without any ability to alter the future, only the capacity to learn from the past and report back to the future world in which he originated. (Got that? Good.) On one of his first, mis-directed trips, he winds up in 1990 being treated by psychiatrist Madeleine Stowe, whom I would have been pleased to treat me, even if only for a hangnail. Brad Pitt shows up as a super-animated fellow patient. Willis is somehow jerked into 1996, where he again runs into Stowe and this time kidnaps her as a kind of living tourist guide.<br/><br/>I kept watching what seemed to me to be a pretty slipshod and ill thought-out movie because the acting is rather good. Bruce Willis, whatever else he may be, is no narcissist. He's made to be dumpy, shaved bald, tattooed, and dressed like a homeless bag man. (Everyone else seems to dress in rags too. The fashion seems to fit the physical milieu in which everything, whatever the time period, is broken, jagged, wet, and made out of junk -- even the scientific laboratories.) Stowe doesn't have to act much to be magnetic but she fits the role alright. Brad Pitt is a manic loony and puts more into it than he has in some other roles.<br/><br/>I said before that it wasn't a comedy. But it's more than just not a comedy. It's tragic, as I suppose it's armature is supposed to be. Why else the allusions to ""Vertigo""?"

Well, not prevent, but just cure things after 99% of the population is dead. Why they aren't trying to stop the virus from happening instead of curing it later is never explained? (Do the bizarre future rulers just want to reign?) Nor is it explained why a convict is sent. ""Because he can remember things?"" Pfft.<br/><br/>Willis sleepwalks through the role. How Madelaine Stowe (90s hubba hubba) ends up falling for this sociopathic, filthy, mental defect is another bizarre angle. It gets real hard at times to put up with Brad Pitt's manic maniac act.

","The acting: really very good.<br/><br/>The direction: clever, thematic and nicely understated.<br/><br/>The plot: unbelievably simple  a six year old would easily spot the holes: - ah but we can't have that can we? So what to do? ""I know"" someone says ""lets hide it."" This is where the film goes wrong: time travel is notoriously difficult to get right in terms of narrative so that it both works out and is internally consistent. Unfortunately the method used here was not to bother and just hope that if everything is sufficiently cryptic-seeming then no one would notice. To be fair this does seem to have worked at least partially judging by some of the reviews. I have a mathematical background and am a lover of science fiction and I am sorry but good acting and film-craft can't cover up a childish plot.<br/><br/>Clearly the overly signalled end was the starting, and perhaps the only, plot premise of this entire film. This really means that the rest of the film was effectively filler to get us there and when analysed in terms of plot consistency this does seem the only possible conclusion. Let us look at some of the many really blatant faux pas:<br/><br/>1. They are not very good at finding the right time or place. Yet they always manage to find the Earth and get there person on the surface wherever and whenever they inadvertently send him. (We will forgive this one: it is a biggie, but it is kind of necessary so lets be generous) <br/><br/>2. Why do they need this 'dead letter' method of passing messages if they can find there target when they inadvertently put him amongst the French forces in world war I or when the collect him from his hospital cell?<br/><br/>3. What is the point anyway? They know when and where to find the first victim  so go back get a blood sample; end of problem.<br/><br/>In those precious few moments in this film when we are given access to some actual plot we are presented with that tried and tested 'Time Travel' conundrum: what came first the cause or the effect? The 'If I hadn't tried to fix it there would not have been a problem to fix, so how did this get started anyway' question. Don't get me wrong, I realise this is the inevitable distillation of most good 'Time Travel' stories and if it is handled well and given a new or interesting spin it still has plenty of mileage left in it. Unfortunately there was nothing new or interesting here; there was not even a real attempt to make it fit with the ultimate (obvious from the beginning) plot twist.<br/><br/>This film could have been so good, but no one likes being taken for a fool. So once one realises that in plot terms the king really does not have any clothes one really feels rather used and this makes the good parts of this film all the harder to appreciate or enjoy. Unfortunately a near miss often come off worse than something a good deal worse: compare this with 'Plan Nine from Outer space'; this is so nearly a good film, yet 'Plan Nine' is arguably less annoying to watch!"

","A fine film 'Twelve Monkeys' conveys a confusing story of rebellion, activism and time travel as well as cause and effect. The content seems bulky and is indeed however it's communicated well through the narrative and story which despite seeming fractured on a surface level is quite simple to follow, littered with surprisingly great performances from what's now recognised as a fantastic cast and brilliantly shot to convey multiple atmospheres there's many a reason why this film is highly regarded however for those who are more aware of the world of film and other releases within and outside of this genre a potential issue arises. The climax is triggered by a viewing of 'Vertigo' (Hitchcock,1958) rather fitting giving the relevance it has in relation to character identity and to some extent conspiracy which can sort of be applied to this film itself yet all seems a bit jarring having now seen both films. It's well documented that 'La Jetée' (Marker, 1962) was the main inspiration for 'Twelve Monkeys' but it feels a little cheap given that it's essentially beat for beat tha same film only the 'remake' (and I use that term very lightly) is slightly padded out by a few subplots which are mostly irrelevant to the core story of the film, nevertheless it's not all bad and the well shot '95 release is worth one watch at least."

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","2","26 December 2016"," Terry Gilliam flourishes an exhilarating vision, and Twelve Monkeys powerfully demonstrates it
","Director Terry Gilliam is a man with a vision that many could only describe as one-of-a-kind, if visceral. If he's proved anything over his previous efforts, with 'Brazil' being his magnum opus, it is that he knows how to exceed in potently building up a dazzling visual heft while carrying on a solid narrative. Gilliam effectively accomplishes this feat in this dystopian science-fiction thriller, and the best part is how well he manages to operate on a script that is not only intelligent but feels vastly original. Though it is clear Terry Gilliam borrows a few elements from other entries in the genre, his execution still feels fresh. And with the charismatic performances by the lead actor Bruce Willis, supporting actress Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt is arguably his most idiosyncratic role of his career. This film is set 2035 when a deadly virus has devastated nearly all of the human race and animals have dominated the Earth. As a result, this disaster has force mankind to live underground. Prisoner James Cole (played by Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1990 in efforts to hunt down an evil group known as the Twelve Monkeys who are believed to the masterminds behind the pandemic that is set spread worldwide in 1996. When he is unexpectedly thrown in a mental institute by Dr. Kathryn Railly (played by Madeleine Stowe), he crosses paths with a mentally unstable Jeffrey Goines (played by Brad Pitt) who appears to have a key to stopping the virus.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam is without a doubt deeply ambitious when it comes to breathing life to his unique vision. From his steampunk-like production design (particularly in the underground world), to the engrossing screenplay by Chris Marker, to the white-knuckle storytelling; this film fulfills just nearly everything, if not everything to excel as an electrifying science-fiction experience. This all begins with a dark premise of a deadly pandemic that places mankind on the doomsday agenda, and instead of driving for the plot into an action-heavy territory, Terry Gilliam places time travel in the mix. Although supplementing time travel in plots is a daunting task often resulting an overwhelming number of plot threads throwing the story in a convoluted romp. Fortunately, Gilliam engineers the plot in a way that is complex, yet solidly makes sense. Though the story occasionally slips into some questionable areas mostly during the second act, Gilliam more than knows how to keep things moving. Following Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe on the run after the evil doers who threaten the future of mankind, and throughout the picture we are hit nearly non-stop twists and turns including James Cole's nightmarish hallucinations to leave us guessing who's good and who's evil, and what is real and what is not real. When the equation is made up, the film brilliantly achieves the thrills audience deserve.<br/><br/>When thinking of Bruce Willis, the first role that may come to your head is when he was facing against the twelve German terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza as John McClane in 'Die Hard'. This film marks an unique role of him as he carries the lead role of James Cole with astounding charisma and humanity. Yes, while it is less light-heart role than John McClane but by the end, it is safe to say that he delivers the role with clear ambition. Supporting along his side Madeleine Stowe as the psychiatrist Kathryn Railly who becomes a helping hand after realizing his out-of-whack claims of the threat of mankind on the horizon become dangerously true as the two stroll on. Like Willis, Stowe gracefully accomplishes a solid performance to make for an engaging character. Each time these two are on screen together, it is almost instantly enthralling. There is almost no doubt however, that the star who greatly stands out above them is Brad Pitt as the mentally rocky patient Jeffrey Goines who pops in and out of the story as a key character of the diabolical plot. Pitt cashes a manic vibe as the mentally unstable patient who displays an unusual behavior that strolls between the line of comedic and eyebrow-raising insanity. And Pitt spears the role through his jittery dialogue and bombastic demeanor. What results is a fascinating character that swipes your attention each time he appears on screen.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is an exhilarating dystopian, science-fiction thrill ride polished by the outstanding vision of director Terry Gilliam. And for lovers of the science-fiction genre, it is a film that expands upon the boundaries of the dystopian subgenre. By the end, it feels like classic, if not a souring masterpiece."

These two writers have been responsible for some of the great films of cinema, from ""Blade Runner"", ""Unforgiven"" to ""Twelve Monkeys""."
"masonmorgan-92917","8","1","2","9 December 2016"," A thought-provoking and bizarre piece of sci-fi
","Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys came at a time where science fiction was always among the year's top blockbusters. Back then, one would have to be extremely innovative within the genre to create something new, as many thought it had all been done before. <br/><br/>Terry Gilliam brings a twisted sense of charisma and fun to a film that is also depressingly somber at times. This mix of bizarre visuals, strange character interactions and chillingly effective time-travel novelties makes Twelve Monkeys one of the most unique and memorable Sci- Fi movies of the 90's. <br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys has a few incredibly talented front-runners including Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Bruce Willis at the time was one of Hollywood's most recognizable actors, mostly for his roles as John McClane in the vastly popular Die Hard franchise. Here though, we see Willis not as a gritty action hero, but a desperate an emotionally panicked prisoner. His character is tasked the mission to save most of humanity from a deadly virus, but little does he know, completing this task is literally impossible. In this universe, you cannot change the future and we are well aware of this as the audience, but watching Willis' persistence and desperation in his attempt to solve an impossible mystery is frustrating and heart wrenching to watch. He does an excellent job displaying his emotional confusion as even he begins to doubt his own sanity. We know that the story doesn't have a happy ending but Willis' performance makes us desperately want one.<br/><br/>Despite Willis' excellent performance, Brad Pitt undoubtedly steals every scene he is in. While he sadly doesn't have too much screen time, every single scene with his character becomes some of the films best and most memorable moments. His portrayal as a patient from a mental institution is so perfectly goofy and hilariously exaggerated, yet he does give some interesting philosophies and insights throughout the movie as we find out how important his character really is to the story. He is easily one of the most memorable sci-fi characters ever. <br/><br/>The story, while never simple, is written in such a way where it is understandable to the casual viewer but also a deeply layered and perplexing narrative for the more attentive viewers to try and uncover. There are many mind-bending little details as the story progresses but by the end Gilliam does a great job of making sure all these smaller details fit in with the rest of the film. <br/><br/>I only had a few issues with the film and the main issue I had was with the pacing. There were some moments in Twelve Monkeys that felt like they were dragging a bit. The movie was entertaining for the most part, but there were times between the gripping narrative where the scenes felt extremely subdued and frankly quite boring. Some portions of the film felt somewhat uneven due to this rapid change of pace. I also think that the love story could have been a little more developed. I wanted the movie's couple to succeed in their mission and live happily ever after, but that was mainly due to their acting abilities as individuals. While the characters were great on their own, I never really felt too much emotional connection between the two characters that end up falling for each other. Their love story feels kind of rushed as it really comes out of nowhere. There was one particular scene that was excellently done and that was when Willis' character first realizes that the woman from his ""dreams"" is the woman he has been working with the whole time. The scene shared between the two characters here was incredibly impactful, but I never felt that same level of emotional connection to the couple after this short sequence. <br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys is a strange yet thought-provoking work of science fiction from an undoubtedly talented director. A gripping and intriguingly original story is paired with a cast of excellently developed characters. The film overall is very easy to love as the bizarre imagery and the sometimes wacky/dark humor makes Twelve Monkeys a blast to watch. While the pacing could've been better and the love story could've felt more natural, Twelve Monkeys is certainly one of the best sci-fi films of the 90's and it still holds up considerably well by today's standards. Just be sure to go into it with an unbiased mind as things are never quite as they appear."
"tankace","8","1","2","21 July 2016"," Monty Pythons writer+ time travel+ Apocalypse= weird but good!
","12 Monkeys is one of the most interesting and weird movies, I have ever seen. Anything from its designs ,costume and setting are unique and I am unable to say for sure from where Terry Gilliam took inspiration. What did you expect he is one of the writers of the Monty Pythons movies ,so such a surrealism in the movie ,it should be expected! So the movie is no doubt a good one and it has the rare distinction to be a good non-linear flick. Just for the record that kind of flick has a confusing story, the editing is made in a non-linear way and at times you find yourself question what the hell is happening. And that method has become famous by Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>And sadly this method though quit interesting, has some major drawbacks: 1) It is difficult 2) You have to know when and where to do it That is the reason why few directors use it. Just take the movie Alexander , which is a complete mess ,honesty I have no idea what was he thinking.<br/><br/>And here we go: In 1996 (keep in my the movie came out in 1995) a man- made virus emerge and devastates the human population forcing us to go under ground in order to survive. So about forty years after a operation is organized and gives to some convicts a choice, if they travel through time in order to gather evidence for the virus for the science team to create an antidote for this virus, they will be pardoned! One of the volunteers is James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, and he is the main character and for this movie the point of view character and this mission ,although it sounds pretty straight forward, there is very important issue with the time travel business: Time traveling has the major side effect , it mess with your perception of reality and we can clearly seeing to Cole's case .<br/><br/>This breaking of the understanding of what is real is seen by the fact Cole is seeing and hear things that doesn't add up and the fact that at times his story line is anything but linear, for he is in one point of time and in other in the next scene makes for a surreal experience ,which at times makes you question ,who must reliable is your POV character, for even though it is clear that time travel creates issues, so much craziness seems a bit extreme! And that is great this gives one for the main themes our relationship with technology, which on the one hand helps us find solution (time traveling) ,but on the other the virus was artificial!<br/><br/>Also an other theme that come in to view with so much time hopping the memories of Cole can they be real or he for real nuts, it is open to you to decide and whatever you think ,you may right,wrong or both ;)! In short in a world that has sane people act like idiots and the, so called, crazy give logical expansions for what is happening ,how could we be sure for what we think ,is made for logical conclusions or we have lost it? That question is made by Brad Pitt's character Jeffrey Goines for that times (literally) he seems be totally mad and what he says makes sense and when we see him ""be sane he sounds and moves with no connection to the reality! <br/><br/>In general the movie give zero care to say an linear story or make any real sense of what is happening, but it try to make you question all of the above ,with some time traveling throw in to the mix ,just to confuse you even more! And here is the broken part, the fact that you can't not make sense what is happening and the nut job character you meet don't help either. That ambiguity makes the flick awesome for philosophical questions like those above can be made, but they have to fit to the story and here they do very well.<br/><br/>In short if you want to play smart to the hipsters,cine snubs that think they are smart then watch that movie and used mad clews in order to break their little pathetic ideals to the iceberg of the Titanic! Have a good it and if you don't understand it the first time, its OK I deed it to watch two times in a weekend to get it and then read some analyses for that! So don't feel that the film wants to make you feel stupid, it wants to make you fear confused, confused?"
"Horror-yo","9","1","2","21 May 2016"," Beautiful, poetic, like an ever-flowing stream...
","This ...is a brilliant film right here. This brings together all of dystopian sci-fi in its most thought-provoking, grim imagery, excellent story-telling that is consistent from the very first scene to that highly emotional ending, subplots that are intentionally distracting enough to serve as lure and densify the main plot - all while having Bruce Willis play the main character excellently, along with the beautiful and also very good Madeleine Stowe, strong cinematography always very contagious with its visuals, its ambiance with carefully picked and adequate background music, always a sentiment of urgency and danger and instability throughout... But more essentially, there is a beautiful poetry about the end of the world's theme, like a romanticism of the apocalypse and hopelessness, the Sisyphus myth, a ringing echo of eternal repetition, a man who will do everything he can even when nobody believes him to try to literally save the world, against all odds, and the beautiful love relationship that is forged through this most unique destiny; and finally, the full ending chapter is masterful at how it brings back abstract past references from earlier, and the film makes you understand something enormous is about to take place and you just can't look away. Excellence on various levels, ambitious and totally accomplished. Either a 9 or a 10."

","The best scenario i have ever seen about time travel. The movie tells perfectly time loop and despair of humanity on this circle. Past or future; that's no matter, we cant control time and whats done is done already. The scenario has own realty and there is no contradiction, that's a point too. Writter's prediction about future, not close to real one. But as I said; movie has own realty, has own world (still wanna see LCD screens) Oh, one more thing; Brad Pitt was awesome. I thought he was really crazy, not acting :). so; if u wanna watch a movie about time travel; this one must be first option. Not Predestination :D."

","One of the functional idiosyncrasy that makes ""Twelve Monkeys"" so provocative is that the entire movie is that the essential complexities is remarkably flabbergasting. Our enigmatic tale is set in the year 2035 and about over 98% of the human population has been expunged by a mysterious devastation. The densely populated humans has now took residents underground underground a relatively uninhibited premise beneath the Earth's surface. Researchers believe that the key component for humans to regain their population they must retrace the roots to the year 1996, the pivotal year when all the turmoil began. They send a volunteer named James Cole (Bruce Willis) on a dangerous initiative to go back to where all the trouble commenced to look for vital information to help correct the reason for the sudden event that lead to the decline of the human population. <br/><br/>This isn't the first outing director Terry Gilliam has when dabbling with the Utopian future. In 1985, Gilliam has orchestrated his eccentric views with the movie ""Brazil"". He still utilizes with bizarre futuristic mechanical apparatuses here and the surreal visuals are surely like to caress your intrigue with along with baroque-styled cartoon puns that are reminiscent to his Monty Python days. <br/><br/>With the personal assistance from director of photography Roger Pratt and production designer Jeffrey Beecroft, once again Gilliam has once again saturated our audience with another cryptic dimension with freaky metallic contraptions customized to enthrall you and freak you out at the same time.<br/><br/>But what Gilliam does that differs from other directors is that he juxtaposes his rapturous obsession for quirkiness, adventure and the playful talent for narratives. Taken as a wink to the Jeunet and Caro film ""City of Lost Children"", the visual exhibited here is visually fearsome along with a very gritty story.<br/><br/>Cole feels that the he's been transported 6 years prior the devastation, in search of the Army of Twelve Monkeys, a faction of scientists from the future who has revealed an intoxicating virus that led to the current problems. Cole ends up institutionalized in a psychiatric ward under the supervision of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe). When she listens to his assignment, she thinks he's lost it and demands to get medicated. He manages to escape when get warped back in time thanks to his futuristic keepers. <br/><br/>Not completely defeated, Cole manages to seek answers from an inmate named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), a schizophrenic individual who also is an animal protector. Transported to 1996, Cole finds that Jeffrey's father Dr. Goines (Christopher Plummer) is a well- renown virologist who's been experimenting with animals. When Dr. Railly decides that Cole is not insane, decides to go with assisting him on his mission. <br/><br/>During Cole's missionary duty, the memories of his childhood seem to haunt him for reasons unknown until the end keeping us guessing by scriptwriters David and Janet Peoples we come to the conclusion that futuristic scientists are often misguided with what happened in our time frame.<br/><br/>Like many of Gilliam's other films it never feels like any of the films he makes look like recycled from other films which is to me the highest compliments. But as a specialist n his respected craft, Gilliam knows how to really connect quite well with his respected performers. Pitt who at the time was becoming an up and coming star showed more exuberance here than his incredible supporting performance in ""Thelma and Louise"". As Goines, we can see Pitt was starting to show that he was more primed for more leading roles. <br/><br/>It was a bit of a shame that Madeline Stowe was not offered very much to here. She has truly a lot to offer here, but has been relegated to playing a very minor role when yet here talent is beyond the surface to her performance in other roles. <br/><br/>The star Bruce Willis is just as focused and intense like he is in his ""Die Hard"" films. Cole is the perfect decoy who's lost in the life that was given to him. He was born at a time where being alive was not good timing. He can still be witty and charming, but he's still a pariah which makes him apologetically a victim and a hero who's yearning for our sympathy."
"PredragReviews","8","1","2","8 April 2016"," Who Can Stop the Army of the 12 Monkeys?
","Good Science Fiction has the power to make us look at ourselves as a society. The events in this movie metaphorically mimic events in our everyday lives. Even though we have not yet discovered time travel, all of the other events in this movie could happen, which is absolutely frightening. This is a dark movie, not for everyone, which has a deep high-minded script and plot (it may take a few watchings to fully understand this one.) The cinematography, directing, and acting are wonderful. Bruce Willis proves that he can do other movies besides his normal action type. He also proved it later in The 6th Sense, but I think this is one of his best performances. As for Brad Pitt, it is his best performance. It's so real that by the end, you'll think he's crazy.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays Cole, a prisoner in a post-apocalyptic future recruited to do some dangerous time-travel work in the past for a group of very odd scientists. The goal of the work only becomes apparent later, and by then there is confusion about whether Cole is really on the mission he thinks he is or is just deluded. Brad Pitt has a major supporting role hamming it up as another who may or may not be insane. Ultimately, while I don't think the film does full justice to its premises and possibilities, it does well enough to be entertaining and thought provoking. Director Terry Gilliam's surrealism adds much. The acting is very good on the whole, itself rather surreal in some of the supporting roles. There is some violence showing how disturbed Willis's character is, not bad for an R-rated movie. It's definitely worth seeing to judge for yourself what it's really about.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."

","The best film in the history, the story, but most important to me the acting. After I watched this movie I started my acting studies. This is something I found interesting too: Gilliam's initial casting choices were Nick Nolte as James Cole and Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Goines, but Universal objected.[6] Gilliam, who first met Bruce Willis while casting Jeff Bridges' role in The Fisher King (1991), believed Willis evoked Cole's characterization as being ""somebody who is strong and dangerous but also vulnerable."" [5] The actor had a trio of tattoos drawn onto his scalp and neck each day when filming: one that indicated his prisoner number, and a pair of barcodes on each side of his neck. Gilliam cast Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly because he was impressed by her performance in Blink (1994).[5] The director first met Stowe when he was casting his abandoned film adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities. ""She has this incredible ethereal beauty and she's incredibly intelligent"", Gilliam said of Stowe. ""Those two things rest very easily with her, and the film needed those elements because it has to be romantic."""
"brianberta","9","1","2","16 January 2016"," An outstanding time travel film which is never too overly-complicated
","Science Fiction has always been my favorite movie genre. I love seeing the imagination in movies of the genre and many of my favorite films are science fiction movies. This movie has everything which I think is mandatory in time travel movies. It has a great plot which gets you interested in its story line, it has great imagination, and a slightly complex story which requires a couple repeat viewings so you can understand and enjoy the movie more.<br/><br/>In the year 1996, a deadly virus wipes out all humanity and the few survivors live underground to avoid becoming sick themselves. In hopes of finding a cure to the virus, a prisoner named James Cole is sent back in time in order to find a group of people called ""The Army of the Twelve Monkeys"" who are believed to have started the virus. However, he is sent to the year 1990 by mistake and he meets a few people from that time period who may be able to help him complete his task.<br/><br/>What makes this film so good is that while it can be complex at some times, it keeps you interested and it makes the viewer want to come back for more. The ending kept me thinking about what it meant long after viewing it and I wanted to watch it again after I watched it for my first time. Also, I did like it a lot more on my second viewing. The movie isn't really too complex up until the end, but it does feel a lot different on your second viewing. Also, the airport flashbacks keep on feeling more important every time they are shown. On your second viewing, they have a greater impact on you as you are already aware of what the purpose of them is.<br/><br/>Also, the ending to this film is very well-done. I honestly did not expect that the film was going to end like how it did and it pleasantly surprised me. I'm sure that some were able to predict the ending if they paid close attention to the airport flashbacks, but I didn't notice it because the camera movements during those scenes were really disorienting. Also, the sequences are really hypnotic so it makes it kind of hard to get a clear view of what's happening. When I first watched the movie, I thought that the scene was meant to show numerous people dying from the outbreak since many other people in the background were laying on the floor.<br/><br/>Also, the visuals and production design is up to notch. The unusual camera angles can be impressive at times at hiding big parts to the film (this works exceptionally well in the ending). There are also cleverly timed zooms which demonstrate how small and insignificant our protagonists are. Gilliam's execution in some of these scenes are perfect and they profoundly always win out. Also, the movie does a very great job with the scenes which take place in the future. The scenes which take place in the future feel very top notch and the set design looks high-tech enough to make you convinced that this is actually what the future will look like. Also, the scene where you see how the city above them looks abandoned is pretty good as it looks like the earth has actually been left to rot for several decades.<br/><br/>The performances in Twelve Monkeys are all pretty well-done. Bruce Willis gives his finest performance yet as he displays sensitivity and emotional depth which is not only believable, but it makes the audience aware of his suffering and struggle to find a cure to the virus. Madeleine Stowe manages to show frenzy and energy in her performance without ever overcooking or overdoing it. Those 2 actors carried the movie excellently, but the actor who steals the show is Brad Pitt. He is amazing because he manages to play a convincingly insane and crazy role without ever seeming the slightest bit annoying and he never overacts or overstays his welcome.<br/><br/>Of course, Twelve Monkeys is not for everyone and it isn't perfect. It may be too choppy or jumbled together for some people's tastes. Also, it may take a few viewings for you to be fully entertained by it. However, no movie is objectively perfect and it's easy to overlook these flaws if you run into them. If you're not too impressed with it on your first viewing, you should consider watching it a second time because if you do, you will be in for a great treat which is what happened to me when I re-watched it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Twelve Monkeys is an outstanding science fiction film which isn't too overly-complicated, but complicated enough to make your 2nd viewing of it feel a lot better and engaging. It also has great acting and great cinematography which convinces you that you are actually in the time periods that the movie takes place in. If you're a huge fan of Christopher Nolan or other complicated films, you will like this movie. There are very few things, if anything, wrong with it and in my opinion, it is one of the best films from the 90's."
"sharky_55","8","1","2","3 December 2015"," I'm in insurance.
","It is 2027, and the last of mankind has been forced underground into a makeshift colony. The production design shows us the worst of this, in the tiny prison cells, and it is reminiscent of Gilliam's dystopic Brazil, but without the towering skyscrapers and ministerial buildings locked up in infrastructure and bureaucratic messes; this future is grimy and claustrophobic. Up above, city halls and apartment buildings lay in dilapidated ruin in the snow, they leak liberally, and lions roar from corner rooftops while bears lurk below. There is less of a satirical and absurdist edge that we usually see from Gilliam in this bleak future vision, although the same stylistic devices remain; the use of a Fresnel lens warps and distorts the multiple faces of the scientists on the television screen, the wide angle lenses do the same as Cole's POV is interrogated in a mental institution bed by the past doctors, and the camera swivels around, disorientating us in the same way that Cole and his good friend Jeffrey Goines is, with overhead and dutch angles that lurk voyeuristically around, over and behind the mental patients..perhaps in some instances overly so. <br/><br/>And there is also the dream sequence that plagues Cole throughout the film and his mission. Against the grimy backdrop of past and present, this particular scene is at a airport, and is in slow motion, but more frantic than anything else, and is bright and overexposed to haunting effect, until we are very sure that this is the setting of the climax. Something must be prevented. But 12 Monkeys constantly reiterates that the past cannot be changed, and so Cole is sent back not to prevent a calamity, but to ensure that the present day survivors have a chance of retaking the surface once again, to insure that possibility. He is sent back naked, but he is not the Terminator, cold and ruthless, but his ramblings and panicked foretelling of the coming disaster mistaken for psychotic delusions, and it is clever that Gilliam manages to make these interrogations and psychiatric evaluations so mundane, like they are lifted from any run of the mill police procedural as the detectives check out potential suspects (and there is almost always a deluded mental patient), and thus so terrifying because Cole's mission is compromised and no one is aware of the impending doom. <br/><br/>He is shacked up with fellow mental patient Jeffrey Goines, in what is perhaps Brad Pitt's finest performance. His first words include being bribed by one of the carers with an imaginary five thousand dollars, and then he commences his grand tour of the facility, and it is wonderful how he manages to create a character so assured yet so obviously troubled. His rapid fire dialogue keys us into his nervousness as well as little clues of his family and intentions, he repeats phrases again and again, his facial tics of jerks of the head and crazy wide eyed smile present the perfect red herring for the biological virus releaser of the future. Now and then he will release in a burst of anger that hints at darkness beneath him, but it is the small scene of David Morse hidden early in the scene which reveals the real perpetrator. <br/><br/>This is a well written time travel thriller, because it is not an easy concept to write about and construct a narrative around, having the need to construct and reinforce its own restrictions, and maintaining a sort of tension that in normal stories cannot be resolved by the ability to do it all over again. It doesn't lean on its twist reveals of Cole's origin and the Army of the 12 Monkeys' role, but they are cleverly done; a forensic report of an antique bullet, the repetition of a key covert phrase, and the reveal of a secret mission through a normal taxi conversation and the sight of giraffes ambling down the highway. Willis makes the plot frantic, because he is so sure of his mission and then he is confined, and then haunted by distorted voices in his head that make him question his whole identity and purpose altogether. We see the remnants of a lost world so clearly as he sticks his head outside the car window like a dog, breathing in the fresh and clean air, and treasuring the sound of music long lost, and it is tragic that we see that same person in his young self, seeing his own death, but not quite understanding. The ending is powerfully quiet; this calamity has already occurred, and will always occur no matter how many trips to the past they make, but perhaps there is a chance of revival."

It is my favorite best Bruce Willis flick alongside with Die Hard, Sin City, The Fifth Elemen and The Jackal, 12 Monkeys Delivers! The movie it self is a modern sci- fi classic that does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.<br/><br/>This movie is about Bruce Willis who stars as a prison inmate from the future who is sent back in time to stop a deadly virus from decimating the world's population. Brad Pitt delivers an Academy Award-nominated performance as a lunatic in an asylum. Directed by Terry Gilliam. An unknown and lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035, so now the Year is 2035. A prison inmate gets a chance to travel back in time to gathering information about an army 12 monkeys and stop them at all cost. But something goes terrible wrong and he is sent back in the year 1990, 6.years earlier and he is now shipped off in to mental institution asylum where there he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) a lunatic in an asylum. The movie has two parts in here. The first part is set in 1990 Asylum and the second part is set 1996 on the airport before the deadly virus is released out. The movie explains the army of 12 monkeys were not responsible for deadly virus but was someone else. I will not tell you who it was you will have to find out for your self who it was.<br/><br/>I found this to be one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in quite a bit. The acting is excellent and I must say that Brad Pitt plays his part brilliantly. The story is good and keep you guessing all the way through. All in all, this is a movie that takes you for an intriguing ride and leaves you with a bit to think about. This was Brad Pitt's second famous role after he finished Se7en another mystery thriller flick. The film has a mystery in it, it keeps guessing you what will happened next what will Cole (Bruce Willis) do to stop Jeffrey (Brad Pitt) and his army of 12 monkeys. This is a movie you have to watch repeatedly to get the full scale of what is going on and who's what when and where. That requires some level of patience and understanding so be prepared. Madeleine Stowe did a perfect outstanding job of acting in this movie.<br/><br/>The main actors set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. This movie is what is a perfect 10 and it will always be a solid Sci-Fi flick even the series of 12 Monkeys was released out this year and the first season is already completed!"" I wish Sci-Fi movies like this one would be made today. Btw Director Terry Gilliam was brilliant and imaginative who directed the most perfectly movie field with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, CGI effects and the story with script that delivers. It is mind blowing, entertaining, and just plain crazy! Plus it has monkeys in it! It is really funny to see Pitt before his TROY/MR. SMITH days. If you really want a shocker look up Pitt in ""The Wrong Side of the Tracks"" with Rick Schroeder. Anyway, this movie rocks. Willis puts in a good performance, and all the characters give this movie a creepy feel. It is kind of like Mad Max, except a city landscape and weird scientists instead of Tina Turner. Although most modern ""the future was destroyed by a virus"" movies are more realistic, this movie is still fun to watch given that it was made in 1995.<br/><br/>12 Monkeys, also known as Twelve Monkeys, is a 1995 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam, inspired by Chris Marker's 1962 short film La Jetée, and starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt, with Christopher Plummer and David Morse in supporting roles.<br/><br/>10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures, Atlas Entertainment, Classico Starring: Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer and Jon Seda Director: Terry Gilliam Screenplay: David Peoples, Janet Peoples, Based on La jetée by Chris Marker Producer: Charles Roven Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 09 Mins.

"avik-basu1889","9","1","2","2 November 2015"," A sci-fi time travel film presented in a quintessentially Gilliam style !!!
","'Twelve Monkeys' is a sci-fi thriller directed by Terry Gilliam. It is based on the French sci-fi featurette 'La Jetée'. It stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt. Time travel is the basis of a major section of the literal storyline. After a virus wipes out 5 billion people in 1997, the remaining human population is forced to abandon the surface of the earth and somehow survive underground, while the animals reclaim control of the surface of the planet. Bruce Willis' character James Cole is picked as a volunteer who is going to be put in a time machine so that he can go back in time so that he can acquire some information about the virus at its unmutated state which would help the scientists in the present to come up with a cure. We are informed that a group named the 'Twelve Monkeys' was behind the spread of this virus in the first place.<br/><br/>The script by David and Janet Peoples which is based on Chris Marker's script for 'La Jetée' is brilliantly written. The beauty of the screenplay lies in its versatility and with Terry Gilliam's visual flair and bravura, the film elevates to the next level. There can be various interpretations for the film. I think Gilliam's style of storytelling actually provokes varied interpretations. There are red herrings, there are subtle hints and there are unanswered questions. This can be seen as a straight up sci-fi film set in a dystopian future with the phenomenon of time travel in it. The concept of whether time and history can be altered or not plays a big part. However it can also be seen as a film about trauma and reality-escapism. Everyone knows that Terry Gilliam is one of the champions of standing up against the mechanical and overly commercialised treatment of the art form of cinema by the big studios and this discontentment and anger is present in the film. Gilliam clearly again makes subtle commentary about the ill-effects of uncontrolled capitalism. We see people make monologues about the materialistic life, the exposure to commercials,etc. Cruelty towards animals is another topic that is addressed which subtly refers to the repression of the poor by the rich.<br/><br/>The film is another example of Terry Gilliam's visual bravura. Just by looking at the dystopian future presented in the film, a viewer would know that this has been made by Gilliam. The look of the film really reminded me of Blade Runner and it has a cyberpunk-esque vibe to it. The film looks bleak and almost dirty, but very intentionally so. The music composed by Paul Buckmaster is beautiful too. <br/><br/>When it comes to the acting, I think this is my favourite performance by Bruce Willis. This was back in the day when Willis actually cared about playing a character rather than himself in every film. He really goes for it here and shows range. He is terrifying, he is weird and at times he exudes child-like innocence(which is important in the context of the film). Madeleine Stowe is also very good. She actually has a tough job of playing the most 'normal' character in the film while all hell is breaking loose around her. Brad Pitt is a dynamite in the film. He has to be admired for deciding to play a character like this at a stage in his career when he could have easily used his looks and played generic characters in romantic comedies. He thoroughly deserved the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>'Twelve Monkeys' is a philosophical sci-fi film that leaves the door open for varied interpretations. The acting is great, Gilliam's style and attention to detail is meticulous. This film has to watched and then re-watched to fully admire its brilliance."
"one-nine-eighty","8","1","2","28 September 2015"," I am insane and this is my reality
","This was one of my favourite films growing up. I like films by Terry Gilliam as they always seem a bit left field and odd but strangely beautiful and ""12 Monkeys"" is no exception. Gilliam has made a full feature length film based on Chris Marker's French short ""La Jetée"", keeping the heart felt messages but also bringing in more Sci-Fi bonkers in a down beat, engaging and beautifully created 129 minutes. It studies the subjectivity of memories and their effect on perceptions of reality; it also looks at the way the interference of technology is creating a decline in modern civilisations communicating with each other. In ""La Jetée"" characters are haunted by visions of their own death, similarly James Cole (Bruce Willis' character in '12 Monkeys') has a constructed memory of his death which flashes onto screen as much as random monkeys do as the film plays out.<br/><br/>In the distant future of 1996 (well, actually the past now in reality as I write this from 2015) a virus wipes out most of the world's population leaving only 1% of humanity hiding underground by 2035. James Cole (Bruce ""Die Hard"" Willis) is a convict who is volunteered to go back in time to 1996 to try and gather information about the man-made virus. All that is known are rumours that the ""Army of the Twelve Monkeys"" released it as a political statement to the world. Unfortunately the almost steam punk-esque era that Cole comes from things still go inevitably wrong with technology; instead of being sent to 1996 Cole is sent to 1990 where he is found, captured and eventually put into a lunatic asylum where he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad ""Fight Club"" Pitt), the wealthy offspring of biological chemical engineer. Cole also meets Dr Kathryn Railly (Madeline ""Last of the Mohicans"" Stowe) who tries to help him to understand that his future 'visions' are all part of a psychosis. As events unfold James is taken/sucked back to his own time/reality to explain his findings but soon gets sent back to 1996 to continue, again meeting Railly and Goines. More events unfold and slowly Railly starts asking herself if what she has advised so far as a psychosis is actually real for Cole, she wonders if Cole is actually telling the truth. The film goes on and Cole, ever the detective, slowly works out who the ""Army of the Twelve Monkeys"" are and what their involvement actually was in bringing the population of humanity down by 5 billion people. Has he found out in time to do something about it or is he destined to fail forever more? I really don't want to spoil the ending too much as this is a masterpiece of 90's film and I can't recommend it highly enough, all I'll say is that while the ending answers a lot of questions it also creates some questions for the audience to mull over as they watch the end credits roll. <br/><br/>Rather than concentrating on a glossy clean film Gilliam chooses to explore some of the dirtier aspects of events; time travel for example - it refreshing to see Cole suffering time travel fatigue and stress because of having to deal with different realities in different times. Contrary to what audiences have been taught of time travel in other films in Gilliam's film it's clunky and almost D-I-Y. Likewise the sanatorium that Cole finds himself in with Goines - rather than it being a structured and tidy institute Gilliam has portrayed it literally as a mad house where some of the inmates actually stand out as pivotal characters – miles apart from the stereotypical portrays Hollywood tends to put on institutions. <br/><br/>Paul Buckmaster's musical score is haunting and creepy while not making itself too obscure and distant. The Peoples (David and Janet Peoples) behind the script have woven a memorising narrative which makes the audience as nauseous from time travel and staying attached to the narrative of the film as much as it does for Cole. <br/><br/>There is a clever use of film reference within the movie which should jump out to all film fans and ties into the question of Cole's life and the question of whether he is trapped in a time loop paradox. There are virtual pats on the back and nod's to Alfred Hitchcock films, filming techniques and even his choice of casting (being practically recreated towards the end of the film). As mentioned Chris Marker's ""La Jetée"" gets a nod too in particularly when Cole and Railly are at the all-day theatre assessing their predicament. The Marx brothers get a virtual nod as does an episode of the Woody Woodpecker cartoon labelled ""Time Tunnel"", even Dennis Potter's ""The Singing Detective"" gets a virtual nod from Gilliam in a film which has some small parallels to ""Blade Runner"" too. FTR - keep an ear open for Bruce Willis saying ""All I see are dead people"" - I forgot this line was in the film but watching it again years later this line made me laugh due to it's obvious parallel to ""the Sixth Sense"" :D<br/><br/>For fear of going over the character limit I'll sign of by saying any good film fan should watch or have already watched this."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","2","18 September 2015"," Timeless, beautiful masterpiece from Terry Gilliam
","Terry Gilliam's masterwork Twelve Monkeys is in my opinion the best of his films, and my favourite time travel movie of all time. Gilliam has a limitless, childlike imagination that surges forward in any project he helms, and this one thrums with a futuristic, fable like aura that pulls you in wonderfully. Bruce Willis, in a remarkably focused, wounded portrayal, plays James Cole, a convict in a derelict underground dystopia. Mankind has been forced down there following a dead global contagion that wiped out the majority of life on the surface. Cole receives a mission from the pseudo government down there: be sent back in time to research what caused the outbreak, and bring information back. Only problem is, he's sent way too far back, to 1994, before the incident. He winds up in a mental institution under the care of gentle, understanding Doctor Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). No one believes his story, and pretty soon, even he starts to have doubts about his own sanity. Brad Pitt plays fellow inmate Jeffrey Goines, a lunatic who figures in the story later. Pitt has never been better, positively frothing at the mouth like a rabid chimpanzee, prancing around with virile madness, crazily present in every moment of his fantastic performance. Willis drops his smirking antihero presence for a simmering vulnerability that gives the piece it's unique heartbeat. There's welcome turns from Jon Seda, David Morse Frank Gorshin and Christopher Plummer as well. Gilliam spins the story to some truly unexpected places, giving us a hard hitting character study and a madcap sci fi adventure with surprisingly down to earth storytelling for such a genre, and a melancholic sensibility that keeps you in the film's mood long after you have finished it. A classic."

"timmeh1404","7","1","2","12 June 2012"," Review of Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys by Koen Moes, Anh Nguyen Hai and Tim Andriessen
","Twelve Monkeys is a science fiction thriller based one Chris Marker's 1962 short film La jetée, it is directed by Terry Gilliam, who is also known for Brazil (1985) and The Fisher King (1991). The film came out in 1995 and since then grossed over $ 168 million, it won the ASCAP award for Top Box Office Films in 1997. The film is set in the 1990's and in the year 2035, and was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Its cast consists of top class actors such as Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve Monkeys was nominated for two Oscars the year after it came out: Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Brad Pitt) and Best Costumes Design (Julie Weiss). Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe in 1996 for his performance.<br/><br/>The film is about James Cole, a convicted criminal that lives in the year 2035. He is part of the 1% of the worldwide population that survived the spreading of a lethal virus in 1996, now living underground. Scientists think that the virus was released by a terrorist group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and with a newly invented of time machine they send James back in time to collect information about the virus. When James time travels for the first time he gets send to the wrong point in time, where he meets Dr Railly, who will later on aid him on his search. He also meets Jeffrey Goines, who he later finds out to be the leader of the Twelve Monkeys. Since the time travelling was so confusing for James he was declared insane by the people of the 90's, and he even gets put away in an insane asylum. Luckily for him he gets send back to the future and eventually even gets another attempt to change the course of history. But you will have to watch the film yourself if you want to find out whether he succeeds in his task or not.<br/><br/>Twelve Monkey's grim post-apocalyptic setting makes up for a good science-fiction story and is quite original. David and Janet Peoples based this story on the famous French silent film 'La jetée'. Some people might consider the story to be weak because of its difficulty, but once the viewer truly enables him- or herself to understand all the plot twists and flashbacks they are given an excellent story. The writers did an outstanding job by introducing all sorts of interesting characters in the story such as Jeffrey Goines. His dialogue is perfect for an animal-activist and anti-consumerist who finds himself in a mental institution like the one he is in. Another aspect which is beautifully represented in Twelve Monkeys is the use of flashbacks which seem carefully planned to build tension and keep viewers interested, in this aspect it succeeds. Because of these perfect planned flashbacks you'll find yourself thinking about the amazing twists and revelations that are to come. If there was one criticism that could be made of the story, time-span is the one to be brought forward. Given that the film is set in 1996 and 1990 respectively and that the film was released during the last month of 1995 you have the feeling a lot of your anxiety is gone because the possibility of all the things happening in the plot happening in real life seem close to impossible. This however should not be seen as important because the story in its own right is excellent and drags you in. Given this Twelve Monkeys has probably one the best stories you'll see in a science-fiction film in a long time.<br/><br/>Other things that played key roles in the making of this film were the sound and lighting in it. Each and every time the timing of the sounds or rather the music is nearly perfect, giving you this extra feeling of craziness, madness, sometimes making it even hilarious. This also drags you into the illusion-like world you are watching. You will start to get confused like the characters, even though the narrative mode is from an omniscient perspective. The lighting, like the use of music, adds up to the mood of the scenes throughout the movie. Also the fact that the film is old makes it more believable. If this film was made in the 21st century, with all the technology we have now, it would be very weird and difficult to attract the viewers into the illusion-like world of the film. However it is incredible that these techniques, the use of sound and lighting, were already so well applied to films in the last century.<br/><br/>In conclusion we think that this film was put together quite well, they especially nailed the chaotic and insane theme. This is off course to be expected from a director such as Terry Gilliam, since you can easily call bizarre fantasy films his field of expertise. The chaotic styling, the acting and off course the music all play a huge role in what makes this film so out of the ordinary, they really contribute to the story, making everything much more of a realistic experience. Most time travel based films are not flawless however, but apart from a couple of minor points we think that the director and writer did a great job at it in this film. If you are into stories set in a post-apocalyptic world, or you really like films with a crazy and schizophrenic feel to it, we strongly advise you to go and watch this terrific classic of a film. And if you then are able look past the old representation of the future, we can assure you that you are in for 2 hours of pure pleasure."

","If you fall asleep two times during a movie it's no wonder you won't figure out what the movie is about.. Don't pay ANY attention to the low ratings on this one. If you aren't intelligent enough to understand this movie after seeing it. (the whole movie) Well, then I am afraid you aren't suitable for watching anything else then cartoons and childish series.<br/><br/>I feel for you.. :( On the other hand, if you are like the majority of people you will greatly appreciate this one! Of course, like in any other movie you may point out what you didn't like although, all in all, when you look at it as a whole, you liked it. Some think the plot, acting, directing or script is perfect, some don't, although as a whole, they all liked the movie.<br/><br/>We live in 2011 so we know how it was in 1997. The movie makers didn't so.. you can't judge them for painting an odd world, or a more futuristic one then what we know of.<br/><br/>The same goes for terminator, matrix and back to the future and all other movies that paint a certain future.<br/><br/>If I was to pick out something I didn't like it was the weird costumes, personalities and talk/script they chose in the future part of the movie, but that alone isn't enough to ditch the movie. And I can't trust my own opinion on this one as I am a farmer, and not an actor, or filmmaker. All in all the movie was great!! Enjoy!!! :D"
"secondtake","8","1","2","26 May 2010"," Dystopia gone Monty Python? Yes, half way.
","Twelve Monkeys (1995)<br/><br/>The best parts of this movie are so farcical, horrifying, inventive, or lyrical, it's hard to swallow the worst parts, which are unbelievable when belief is required, and sentimental when sentiment is cheap.<br/><br/>You can see a Monty Python influence in director Terry Gilliam's style, or vision, in parts of the movie, and in other parts it more hard edge dystopia. Both work well. The lead actors (Brad Pitt in a twitchy role and Bruce Willis in a confused tough guy role) are right on, and they make the movie have heart where it might have just been a great production designer's extravaganza. Lead female Madeleine Stowe plays the slightly too-cocky psychiatrist well, getting in the middle of an awful lot of madness.<br/><br/>The movie is terrifying in its vision of a hellish, dark, poisoned future, and yet it's comic and silly enough to not be a downer movie. The overtly clever main scene which is shown to us with a little too much cinematic control (we sense a movie trick of editing, and slow-mo, right off the bat) is key to the plot, but sort of a thin bit of the larger plot. But following the main characters through their race against time, almost literally, is totally absorbing. There are many scenes to remember, and the whole experience is just tongue-in-cheek enough to forgive the movie makers their glitches and foibles.<br/><br/>Watch it. It's a great ride."
"rickytrapp","10","1","2","29 March 2009"," Bruce Willis' death still makes me cry
","Terry Gilliam pulled it off. In my book, he made the saddest scene in any sci-fi movie. When James Cole dies, a younger version of him is standing a few meters away watching himself die. The plot is a convict named Cole is sent back in time to find information about a virus that has sent all people underground. They believe it to be the work of a radical group called The Army Of The Twelve Monkeys, led by Brad Pitt in a brilliant Oscar nominated role. Cole enlists the help of psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe). But this is the biggest spoiler of all: there is no happy ending. Bruce Willis dies and the virus is unleashed.

Is it crazy to be compassionate? Gotta love Bruce, for all his violent roles, he's such a guy's guy, and this Madeline Stowe, absolutely magnificent, the perfection of musicality, sensitivity, passion, femininity, poetry (yes I'm in love...), the most ultimately mariable woman in the recent decade.<br/><br/>Can't wait till we have time travel, so we can finally figure out the conundrum, can we really kill time without damaging destiny?"
"ShootingShark","7","1","2","29 October 2008"," Intelligent, Exciting, Enjoyably Confusing Thriller Of Time Traveller On The Run
","In the future, the Earth has been devastated by a virus and the survivors scavenge a living underground. James Cole is sent back in time to gather information on the cause of the catastrophe, but the effects of the process and his crazy story make everyone think he's insane. He kidnaps his psychiatrist, Kathryn Railly, who starts to believe him, but can he convince her, and what do his prophetic dreams foretell ?<br/><br/>This exciting time travel thriller is extremely well made, features great performances, and above all is a terrific twisty-turny tale of coincidence, random chance, cosmic destiny and misunderstanding. It cleverly throws the viewer off-guard with what seem like vital plot points which turn out to be irrelevant, while much more inconspicuous details become crucially important. The most daring example of this is the whole Jeffrey/Pitt subplot of The Army Of The Twelve Monkeys, which takes up reels and reels of screen time but in the end is actually completely redundant; it's funny, intriguing and completely fools our heroes. Equally amusing/tragic is the James-Kathryn sanity arc throughout the film; she spends the first half convincing him he's crazy and succeeds, then the second telling him he was right all along. Willis is great in a very atypical performance here; he's a tough guy but without any macho posing or snappy lines, and handles his dangerous psychosis and fearful déjà vu with many intense moments, like the bit where he hears Fats Domino singing Blueberry Hill and cries with joy. Stowe gives strong support as the rational shrink who has to open her mind to a wider reality (she's great in a whole slew of movies in the late eighties/early nineties), and Pitt is hilarious as the thoroughly cracked Jeffrey in a showcase role, all googly eyes and manic finger waving - the scene where he disrupts the loony bin so that James can escape is a comic highlight. Gilliam directs with his customary visual flair, delighting in the (many) moments where he catches us off balance with another delicious kink in the story, but also with a terrific feel for the drama; when Kathryn looks round the airport and finally sees the boy, it's a moment of pure emotional resonance. Featuring fabulous photography throughout by the highly talented Roger Pratt, the camera-work evinces arty/classical (the futuristic scenes), down and dirty (the streets of Philly), disorienting (the asylum) and smooth/classical (the denouement). Brilliantly written by the husband and wife team of David and Janet Peoples (he also wrote Blade Runner and Unforgiven, and directed a great obscure movie called The Blood Of Heroes), and inspired by Chris Marker's influential 1962 French photo-montage short, La Jetée. Not quite Gilliam's best perhaps, but a solid, through-provoking and well-acted science-fiction thriller. Don't miss it."
"bentonrp","10","1","2","3 October 2008"," It's all about Interconnectivity.
","A well done movie. Most people say the ending is confusing, but how easily they forget that the whole movie is confusing, and if the meaning of the movie is a good one, that's the only way such an end could stick out in their heads. So, I thought the whole movie might be underrated, since I felt like the theme was never cleared up. I never thought it was as simple as being about madness, memory, or doomsday. I figured it was about interconnectivity. All of those other themes are just intertwined and reoccurring elements because of the time travel element in the story. The whole movie is a look at Cole's life through this era of time travel, and how he is not big enough to save the world, but plays a vital part in making it better, and suffers along the way, just like us all.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, when Cole keeps repeating, ""You can't change the past,"" he is already too much of a pessimist for the demands of such a task. But whether he is defeated because he is just that way, or he is just that way because his memory is scarred from childhood first, is something of irrelevance; It's not important which caused which, only that strong interconnection from time travel caused his memory and negativity to intertwine. (His memory of the bad guy who rudely pushes him takes the form of Brad Pitt's character, either because he mixes his personal feelings with the mission (defeatist), or because his memory finds something reminiscent of the enemy to Brad Pitt's character, who is involved with solving the plot (memory). He mentions that he ""had always known you like this"" to Madaline Stowe's character either because he strongly related to the woman at the airport from her distress and yet ability to smile at him, and carried out his own personal motivations based on that (defeatist), or because he actually remembers in some small way, that it is a loophole of the same, exact person, since his childhood connection with his own demise is strong enough to allow him to recall that about her, leading her to smile as she is aware of this (memory).)<br/><br/>The final scene is only meant to further reinstate the subject of interconnectivity: As Cole was not strong enough for the magnitude of the task, we see even one of the lead scientists having an encounter with the event under scrutiny, proving that we all eventually are interconnected at an astonishingly close range, and that we are bound to encounter any highlighted event in one manner or another. The film, having already examined Cole's life and demise for all it's worth, now passes the massive task through the scientist's existence, as we can already see certain personality traits in her that will lead her to struggle in her own quest for the truth: she is insecure (working in insurance), rigid, overly-thoughtful, and a little naive to trusting. The only difference is, that as time travel interconnects her own personality with her memory, this experience on the plane will be the moment that replays over and over in her own mind, showing the greater the task is in the world, the more we are all victims to our own insufficiencies of it."

The prisoners gain pardons for their very stressful time travel and one of the best is James Cole played by Bruce Willis. After several journeys back in time Cole discovers that the Animal Liberation group The 12 Monkeys headed by Jeffrey Goines ( Brad Pitt) son of Dr Goines is some how connected. Also on theses time travel episodes he repeatedly meets Psychiatrist Dr Railly (Madelaine Stowe)who eventually realizes that she has been repeatedly meeting Cole and that the time travel and his story of the plight of the human race is real. <br/><br/>This film contains a brilliant interweaving plot structure that skillfully deals with the anomalies of time travel science fiction as well as a plausible man made scenario for the disastrous extinction of the human species.<br/><br/>an extraordinary masterpiece of a Film has become recognised as one of the great classics of film making. It is already a cult classic amongst the a List actors and directors. <br/><br/>Terry Gilliam extracts brilliant performances from all the actors and the whole spectrum of emotion including the romance and moment of belief of Dr Railly for Cole."

","""12 Monkeys"" is a relentless zigzag of a film with a twisted plot of unexpected turns...it launches us into the future (in this case, 1996) and the past (in this case, 1990, or sometimes even earlier) with such jerky frequency that 'the present' is difficult to discern. Of course, this type of disorientation is typical of director Terry Gilliam, whose films are often marked by an unbridled visionary wackiness that threatens sensory overload (just check out his adaptation of ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas""). With ""12 Monkeys,"" though, a more somber tone pervades as confused, possibly schizophrenic time traveler James Cole (a properly detached Bruce Willis) enlists the help of psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) to stop an organization--known only as ""The Army of the Twelve Monkeys""--bent on carrying out an apocalyptic plan. Or is all as it seems? Perhaps it would be too generous to put ""12 Monkeys"" on the same pedestal as a vague, thought-provoking work like ""Eraserhead,"" but I cannot deny the David Lynch-quality this film possesses. With a nonlinear structure and a story where every detail seems to contribute to a larger whole, the movie easily invites multiple viewings and interpretations. Gilliam's trademark usage of odd camera angles and his fixation on eccentric characters is ever-present, but the maturity of the telling is a marked departure from the norm--this is a downbeat, fearful vision of the end of the world (Brad Pitt's manic spoiled rich-kid is less a source of comic relief and more a chilling reminder of the escalating insanity of the tale) that offers no easy answers."

Not only is the direction top notch but the acting is superb, Brad Pitt's best performance since Floyd in True Romance and Bruce Willis shines in a complex and difficult role. The great emphasis throughout this film is whether it's true or James Cole is just crazy and it could swing either way until the end, at times you will believe it one way at times you will believe it the other. For a time travel paradox story its surprisingly easy to grasp and simple to follow, the story is kept fairly simple as not to confuse the viewer and we focus more on the characters interactions.

","Twelve Monkeys is one of my favorite sci-fi movies. It's not one of those idiotic ""bring your huge guns and shoot everything that moves!"" movies, but a movie, which makes you think about things, like past and future. Time and sanity.<br/><br/>Plot in the peanut shell is this: 1996 a virus wipes out most of the human race. Survivors are forced to life underground, while all other species, immune to the human only virus, take over the surface of the planet. Humans try to discover a cure to this dreadful disease and so they must use time-travel to discover pure form, un-mutated form, of the virus.<br/><br/>Cole, Bruce Willis, is a prisoner, who 'volunteers' to take these hazardous trips to locate the pure virus. But when he does go further and further in time he begins to question his own sanity. What is real and what is in my imagination? Also can the time be changed? Can he stop the madman from spreading the virus, or will it all start again? <br/><br/>Kathryn Railly, portrayed by Madeleine Stowe, is a psychiatrist, who takes care of Cole in the past, when delirious and confused man is locked up in mental asylum. No one is willing to listen Cole. but then Cole disappears from the locked room.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Goines, Prad Pitt, is a son of a millionaire Dr. Goines, Cristopher Plummer, a famous virologist. Cole meets Jeffrey in a asylum, and after Cole escapes he discoverers, that Jeffrey might have his hands in the destruction of human race. <br/><br/>Unlike many thinking man movies Twelve Monkeys manages to keep its grip through out the whole movie. That is mostly the asset of Terry Gilliam, who does his absolute best direction job of his career. he manages to keep script tightly in his hands, and so everything that happens in the world of this film seems so logic, even tough things are mostly very surprising.<br/><br/>Also the music and acting is superb through the whole film, and it is not wrong to say, that Bruce Willis is in one of his best roles as Cole.<br/><br/>My thumbs up."

","if this film does not at least make one ask one question, there is something wrong. i love films that involve the audience and that is what terry gilliam has done. he took a short film and turned it into his own masterpiece. he also gave a grim look at Philadelphia (in the 1996 philly). it depicted a city, not the way is appears, but the way it feels. this is, to me, the first 'serious' drama by gilliam. it does include humor, but it is darker and poking fun at ourselves, while making commentary. the asylum is hysterical, but with a twinge of reality that can't make you wonder. what is crazy? that is essentially the theme of this movie. what is fantasy and what is reality? this challenges the viewer to take stock of their own life, their own reality, if that viewer is so bold. i have watched this film many times and it sets my mind to thinking every time. it is an emotional journey. it is one i think people who suffer from some form of dysfunction can identify with. asking the same questions the film sets to it main character. i have been reading comments left about terry gilliam films by other people and i don't understand why there are folks who dislike his movies. i think there are some that don't get his brand of humor, the one that differs from the monty python stuff. i, myself, am not so taken by the monty python stuff, but his more recent work is of a much more emotional type. and not just the sad or troubled. it explores up and downs. if one goes to a movie and checks their brain at the door, or heart, this movie is not for them. there are a lot of subtle elements in the scenes and in the dialogue. the plot is worked out, but doesn't lead the viewer. the fact is, even if you know what might happen next (a lot of foreshadowing is used), you don't care. it is a slow realization. and by the time the main character has made his realization, it is too late. we often realize things like that. experiencing the repercussions of our actions. or making the same mistakes over and over again. gilliam leaves enough room for me to suppose all sorts of things. films that are more rigid or have no shape don't achieve the same thing. to those who have a problem with ideas not being original, they never studied art. for nothing is original, but we still continue to create. being original is a human desire to feel special and that nothing can come close to that. well look at all the remakes of films that exist and look at all the adaptations of novels there are. then what films left are there, that aren't based on some art flick, no one in main stream America has seen, except maybe the enthusiasts or professionals. what do you have left? i believe in treatment, performance, editing, score and cinematography. all these elements and more merge to form a unique product. i do detest the movie that copies dialogue word for word. (la feme nakita - point of no return) truth is in the impact it has. the vessel that receives the experience may not always be equipped to handle the information so it is rejected, while giving vital energy to those of us that are."

OK. So you want to know if this film has flaws. Are there any flaws in this film at all, ever? I'd be lying if I said no, if I said that I did not find at least one second of this film slightly annoying. I was slightly peeved at early appearances from the character of Dr. Railly, but as the film progresses (i promise not to give anything away to unfortunates who have yet to see this beautiful, beautiful film)she givess a more believable, less annoying performance. Perhaps it's just that I grew to like her more as the film progressed, but this is just a nit-picky observation and it wasn't a serious dislike that distracted from the film, I just found her character a bit stuck up. Also, as you may expect from a Gilliam film, you may escape from this film a nervous wreck on the verge of a major heart attack, but MAN! is it Liberating?! (Grits teeth in crazed smile). (screams, monkey-like).<br/><br/>Bruce Willis gives a performance as good as that given in Pulp Fiction, but in no way reminiscent of this, proving that he isn't just some ageing bald guy shouting catchphrases all the time, that he is indeed a talented actor and can 'do art'.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt. Hmm. This may possibly be one of those films that proves the talent of actors that have grown to carry tired associations. Yes, we know that Brad Pitt is a very attractive man. We are comfortable with this, and accept that some film makers may exploit this fact to pull audiences. However, we also know, having observed this film (and Fight Club)that he is also a very, very good choice in a serious and seriously good film because he's really good. Not JUST good, like in Interview With The Vampire, which I'm not convinced about because I don't think he suited the role, but really, really great, fantastic, applaudable, surprising, admirable. If you haven't seen this film yet, do. I'm not going to plead, I've seen it. It's you who's going to benefit dramatically from seeing this heaven sent film. <br/><br/>I love it.

","***POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I saw Twelve Monkeys last night for the first time all the way through. I had seen bits and pieces of the movie a long time ago but never the whole movie. I have to say that I was intrigued by the movie but was a little disappointed by a few things.<br/><br/>First, I thought the acting was basically good. Bruce Willis was superb as James ""Bob"" Cole, as he was pretty sympathetic all through the movie. He seemed both willing to go back into the past but unsure of whether or not he could really do anything or if it would even make a difference.<br/><br/>Madeline Stowe was good for most of the movie as Dr. Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist. Yet, I thought her transformation at the end of the movie was a little sudden. She went from being a pure skeptic and psychiatrist to a pure believer and love interest pretty quickly once she went back to Philly without Cole.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was certainly memorable as crazy Jeffrey Goines, but I thought his performance was TOO over-the-top and actually pretty annoying. All of the hand motions and the long, mumbling speeches were a bit tiring. I couldn't help but think that Jeffrey was just a hyperactive version of Tyler Durden (Fight Club) or even David Mills (Seven)--all of whom use hand-gestures to excess.<br/><br/>I thought the directing was really good from Terry Gilliam. He made the future look very bleak and the way he shot the insane asylum--with its white lights (so white that the only words that comes to mind are antiseptic or clean...maybe if you see the movie, you'll understand what I mean)--was brilliant as it seemed like an absolute daunting and absurd place.<br/><br/>The ending was a little strange too. I think there's about two or three ways you could evaluate how the movie goes. That fact will frustrate those looking for closure, but personally, I like deciding how I think the story was meant to end.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting ranged from the great to the annoying but the directing was very good and the story is certainly interesting.<br/><br/>I give it a 7/10"

","The Concept: 'Cuckoo' meets 'Terminator' meets Kubrick<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly frustrating.  Terry Gilliam is somewhat intelligent in his constructions--and his work is at least technically competent--but this just makes me want to pull my hair out.  Why?<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>The MPAA never understands work like this and their rating is apt proof.<br/><br/>First of all, the good.  Pitt, Stowe, and Willis are all interesting.  The production design is above 'Grinch' yet still below 'Brazil.'  Gilliam--like Kubrick in 'Strangelove' and 'Glory'--has a good mind for his environments, he and Lynch are everything that Burton wants to be.  He frequently uses frames of architecture, films, and art to bookmark his points.  He even makes the notion that games imprison the mind.  So what's wrong?<br/><br/>The problem is that the plot is explained too well despite a script from the writer of 'Blade Runner'.  That's my one black eye for this project, but it's a black eye that grows into an infected skull fracture.  'The Matrix' suffers from this problem, so does 'Fight Club' though 'Fight' had the advantage of not falling into a loop .<br/><br/>So, despite this killer flaw, it is still interesting material.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Midrange Material"

","Although I'm not a big fan of time travel movies because they twist your brain so much and you still cannot come up with a decent logical answer, I liked `Twelve Monkeys' as a time travel movie and otherwise.<br/><br/>There is one feeling I particularly get from time traveling stories. It's the way the characters are organically and cosmically connected to each other, there is a sense of universal order when two people meet each other and the feeling of past/ future familiarity forms inside them. This is what happens with James Cole and dr. Railly. They know somehow they are bound to each other, but they just have to let things happen to get to know HOW they are connected. The courses of their lives are governed by the implacable flow or leaps of time, which already set into place the events for them.<br/><br/>
I also enjoyed the discourse of social insanity, delivered in a funny and witty manner by Brad Pitt's lunatic character. Although his ideas are not new (not wanting to be a consumer labels you as a crazy person, or if others decide you are insane, you accept it and become insane or the fact that the real' crazy people are outside institutions) they are still sensible and captivating. <br/><br/>Overall, Twelve Monkeys is not the most original film I have ever seen, but it's pleasant, active, has a natural feeling about it so that you can empathize and communicate with the characters. Quite nice."

","Here's a far-fetched, stupid metaphor for you: Terry Gilliam is to film directors what an ivory, diamond-encrusted harpsichord is to a symphonic orchestra. A precious, unique artefact's, but a very impractical one, and without a doubt, an acquired taste. I love Gilliam for his relentless blending of poetry and silliness, his is a unique voice we should treasure more.<br/><br/>Someone in the early nineties clearly thought there was enough cross-over potential in not just Gilliam, but a story based on a niche classic, experimental 60s photo-montage film La Jetee, assigned homework of film students everywhere. From this seminal piece, writer David Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) crafted a nifty time-traveling thriller which, in safe hands, would have probably been a safe investment for the Summer season.<br/><br/>it's even nicer then, that someone threw caution to the wind and entrusted this, along with a sizable budget, to Gilliam, who not only managed to lure in heavy-hitter Bruce Willis, but draw from him unprecedented depth, pathos and commitment. Their collaboration made this a very unusual Summer blockbuster, and drew a very able supporting cast, chiefly Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt, the latter stealing every scene he appears in. <br/><br/>Narratively-speaking, many reviewers have pointed out that this is a bit of a one-off, the ""twist"" weighing so heavily over everything, but as with all Gilliam's work, the real beauty is in the small touches, many of which reward repeat viewings."

I saw ""Twelve Monkeys"" and was thoroughly impressed, entertained, surprised that I had never heard of this masterpiece before. Bruce Willis' role was genius along with Brad Pitt.

As good as the movie is, this DVD has the very best ""making of"" feature I've seen yet. It was done independently and in parallel with making the movie, and gives you a clear idea how this movie was made from concept through test screenings and finally release.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is complex, but involves a future, underground civilization about A.D. 2035, sending people back in time to try and figure out how to prevent, or to find an antidote for, a deadly virus that had exterminated 99% of the world population. It moves back and forth, from ""present"" to past, and drops good clues about how everything fits in. Ultimately all is resolved, but you have to be observant. A great movie for real ""movie watchers"".<br/><br/>The 3 main actors all do a fine job, but Brad Pitt as the semi-crazy character is so well done, and funny, that it is hard to imagine the movie with anyone else. Overall a really fine movie.<br/><br/>(Sept 2012: I just re-watched it after 12 years, I enjoyed it again!)<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The time-traveler was told to find the ""Army of the 12 Monkeys"" as the likely responsible group, but in the end that turned out to be a red herring. The culprit was actually a mad scientist working for a wealthy businessman, and they managed to figure this out at the airport as he was starting his deadly journey in 1996 to spread the virus across the world.

But consistency in a time travel story is rare enough, and I remember the delighted purring made by people I knew who saw the film and found that it didn't take them for fools.<br/><br/>I haven't seen `La Jetée', so I can't say how much brilliance `Twelve Monkeys' owes to the earlier, shorter work.  There are conflicting accounts. Presumably Gilliam's version adds SOMETHING to the tale.  It's much longer, and none of the time is wasted.<br/><br/>If you've heard that this is the story of a time traveller who reports that he comes from the future and is locked away in an asylum as a result, and if this makes you sigh wearily and reach for something else - I know exactly how you feel.  But you've got it all wrong.  The action does NOT get bogged down in the loony bin; the story is NOT your standard `I'm sane, I tell you - saaane!' chestnut; indeed, the film cracks the chestnut to give a satisfying surprise to everyone like me who hates that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Don't be put off, either, if you're one of those people who finds Gilliam's visual ticks (beneath-the-nostrils close-ups, stupid tilting camera) irritating.  Again, I do too, but there aren't so many of them in `Twelve Monkeys'; and anyway, they aren't a problem.  The film looks great.  Visual imagination lifts rather than detracts from the story.  And it really is such a neat story.<br/><br/>There's more to praise but other writers can handle that.  If there's a better science fiction film from the 1990s I've yet to see it - which isn't saying THAT much, since there's a fair few I haven't seen; but it's saying something."

","In the world of the mind and in the realm of the imagination, anything is possible-- even the ability to transport someone through time.  So suspend your disbelief for awhile, check it at the door, and launch yourself into `12 Monkeys,' an adventure directed by Terry Gilliam that takes you into the past by way of the future.  It begins sometime in the near future, a time in which the inhabitants of the Earth are forced to live underground, having been driven there in 1996, when a deadly virus was intentionally released into the atmosphere rendering the air unbreathable and ultimately killing five billion people.  Now scientists believe they have attained the capability of developing a way to make the air breathable again, in which case mankind will be able to return to the surface of the planet and rebuild a new world.  But their plan is contingent upon first acquiring a sample of the virus in it's original, pure form, rather than the mutated strains currently available to them.  This means that someone must be sent back to 1996 to collect data and locate the source of the virus, which would then enable them to send a scientist back to procure the needed sample. <br/><br/>
	Thus far, though they have successfully implemented a system of time travel, their efforts have been for naught.  Using `volunteers' from the penal system, they have failed time and again for any number of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the lack of cooperation and effort put forth by their `chosen' few .  Now, however, they feel they have just the man for the job, a prisoner named James Cole (Bruce Willis), who has agreed to collect their necessary data in exchange for a full pardon.  The biggest problem seems to be that their `time targeting' isn't exactly precise.  They have information that will help Cole once he gets there-- a cryptic message they uncovered points to a high profile group known as the `Army of the 12 Monkeys' as being responsible for unleashing the virus-- and if they can just land Cole sometime before December of 96, he'll be able to track them down.  So, Cole suits up-- and the adventure begins.<br/><br/>	As he did with his 1985 film, `Brazil,' Gilliam here has created a bizarre world that seems to have been dropped through the looking glass.  He presents a future that comes through as something of a subterranean version of the world in `Blade Runner;' a bit darker and with the definition of a reflection in a fun house mirror.  And it's all quite effective, especially in contrast to the `real' world of the past in which Cole finds himself. But what really makes it interesting and keeps the audience involved is the fact that you know everything that Cole knows, which allows you to share his frustration in dealing with an unimaginable situation, and it makes it a tense and exciting experience.  It works because Gilliam has created a very real fantasy world, as well as a believable `present' that for the purpose of the film is actually the `past.'  The plot becomes fairly complex at times, but after a couple of twists and turns, it all comes together and makes sense in the end.  <br/><br/>	Bruce Willis does a good job in this one, creating a character that is actually quite unlike any other he's ever done.  Cole is certainly heroic, but not in the same straightforward manner as John McClane in the `Die Hard' series, or the more subtle, understated hero of `Unbreakable,' David Dunn. And the emotional character development you see in Cole is credibly realized, for which Willis and Gilliam both deserve a nod of recognition, as it's a good piece of acting by Willis and a demonstration of Gilliam's ability as a director.  It all comes about quite naturally through the narrative of the story, which makes it believable and very real.<br/><br/>	Brad Pitt, meanwhile, practically steals the show in his supporting role as Jeffrey Goines, the well-to-do idealist with sensibilities that are just a notch off center.  It's a memorable character, created with nuance and detail, and he deservedly received an Oscar nomination for it.  Also giving a notable performance is Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist who meets up with Cole and attempts to sort out his psyche while trying to find out just who he really is and where he came from.   <br/><br/>
	The supporting cast includes Jon Seda (Jose), Christopher Plummer (Dr. Goines), David Morse (Dr. Peters), Frank Gorshin (Dr. Fletcher) and Michael Chance (Scarface).  With an ending worthy of M. Night Shyamalan, `12 Monkeys' is an engrossing action/suspense/drama that will keep you going until the very end.  And in retrospect, few movies fall just outside of a specific genre or category the way this one does, so for the sake of argument, I'll create one and call it `Gilliam Noir'-- a new genre especially for Gilliam's films (and others like them), including `Brazil' and `The Fisher King.'  Unique films that deserve their own unique place as paragons of cinematic achievement.  It's all about the artistry of film, and the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10."

His over-the-top yet exceptional acting breaths life into this otherwise pretty lackluster movie and it goes without saying that these vivid moments are also the most interesting ones of the entire motion picture.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, on the other hand, was handpicked by director Terry Gilliam because he had noticed how Wiliis in the first ""Die hard""-movie could play both a tough yet vulnerable character at the same time. And this was exactly what the American director needed for the main part. For the role of the psychiatrist however, Terry Gilliam wanted a beautiful woman with an intelligent appearance in the midst of a devastated world. He chose Madeleine Stowe. I'm not particularly a fan of hers, but she does justice to this role.<br/><br/>In short: A weird and heavy movie that might not always keep your attention despite an amazing Brad Pitt, but be sure to watch the entire film for its unexpected ending."

","After Pleasantville, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It is entirely pretentious, dull and stupid.  The movie proceeds at a snails pace leading towards an absurdly obvious climax that has been telegraphed for the entire movie utilizing a flash back/flash forward technique copied from other movies.  We get to see snippets of something that hasn't yet happened, or perhaps it has, and we are supposed to play the art of dutiful detective and figure out what it all means.  The creators of the film would have you believe this is a cerebral tour de force, an intellectual masterpiece, a thinking man's buck rogers.  And they try desperately to make it a smart movie.  A cryptic plot can be interesting.  But this movie is deliberately cryptic and convoluted - it tries to elevate itself to an intellectual plane far out of it's reach.

","12 Monkeys is not a great film, due to previously mentioned flaws, and some other minor continuity issues, as well as the sometimes heavyhanded ties of James Cole to Jesus Christ (both JC's). Also, a caveat to anyone who has seen Marker's film, for this film will, unfortunately, seem far less adventurous artistically than it really is. But it works both as a time travel fable and the depiction of an insane mind because event though, in the film's diegetic reality, Cole seems to be a genuine time traveler, he is almost assuredly a madman, as well. As is Dr. Railly, who violates one of the cardinal rules of her profession, becoming emotionally and sexually involved with her patient. It is also one of the rare films that benefited from later historical events; in this case, obviously 9/11, for both Cole and Peters provide excellent depictions of the differing halves of the criminal/terrorist mindsets of believing in their own realities and the rectitude of their actions, despite the violence incurred. Thus, while 12 Monkeys is not a film in a league with other sci fi films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, nor is it as daring as Gilliam's own earlier Brazil, it is a film of quality. And the fact that it was spawned in Hollywood shows that randomness can be a very, very good thing, in or out of the time travel scenario."

","First, I remember seeing La Jetee (can't do the accent, sorry) in a film class in 1973.  If you have not seen it, try somehow. It is a compelling, mysterious, wonderful 29 minutes of film, very French.<br/><br/>Second, as a psychiatric social worker, I was struck by what I thought was the most authentic piece of dialogue in the whole film.  Madeline Stowe's character (a psychologist, if I remember correctly) wakes up next to Bruce Willis' character.  He slobberingly turns to her and says, ""I saw you in my dream."" (Or words to that effect).  Rather than attempting to run screaming from the room (the normal human reaction), Stowe turns to him and says, in a wonderful, even voice, ""Tell me about your dream.""<br/><br/>I almost fell out of my seat laughing.  It was so perfect.<br/><br/>Third, I used to live in Baltimore, Maryland.  One Sunday morning, I saw Madeline Stowe jogging by.  (She was on location in Baltimore.  I didn't know it.)  A lovely woman.  A lovely moment."

","Yeah it's a long film, and yeah, some of the sequences are a little on the cringing side, but hey, it's a Terry Gilliam film and it is a great and magical journey despite all of its faults. Based on the photobook/stills film by Chris Marker ""La Jetee"" - a film Constance Penley once declared impossible to remake - any intelligent viewer will spot that this is a movie that is unlikely to end happily.  Plotlines criss-cross all over the place in a time-twisting manner that makes the spiraling time-frame of ""Terminator 2"" seem positively easy to follow.  The ""Monkeys"" virus subplot (or should that be McGuffin in the great Hitchcockian tradition?) is left throughly ambiguous at the end: but that isn't why I sob uncontrollably even though I've watched the movie about 20 times.

"Gubby-Allen","5","2","11","4 April 2002"," Bloody hard work
","reading the description of this film on the cover sends a chill up me, as it's sounds a plot for the ultimate film. Even having seen it & not enjoyed it, it still sounds an amazing concept. In reality, it was very poorly executed.<br/><br/>I spent so much of the film re-winding the tape to clarify what was happening. I'm not saying it was complicated, but it required far more than 100% concentration. There must have been a better way of tackling time travel than this.<br/><br/>My biggest problems with this were the characters & acting. Bruce looked totally uninterested in his role & just ambled about (almost Stallone esque) grunting & mumbling looking thoroughly bored & miserable. Madeline Stowe's character was your typical unconvincing screaming woman, Brad Pitt weren't in it enough & when he was (though not through bad acting) looked like he was in a school play in the role of a character thought up in 10 minutes.<br/><br/>It seemed a film that deliberately tried to be awkward & complex thus to appeal to those who like to see themselves above everyone else in intelligence (but who very rarely are). It was also made for your ""sci-fi junkies and anyone who dislikes anything remotely mainstream.<br/><br/>While I love your 'Back to the Future type films, I don't want all time travel films to be tackled like that. I like something a little more adult that requires more thinking & mystery. So, I should've liked this. Unfortunately, it just tried far too hard to be more complex.<br/><br/>In any film you should be able to (in effect) place or imagine yourself in the role of one main characters.<br/><br/>Sadly, there wasn't one single thing that Crowe done in Twelve Monkeys that any normal human, in his position, would've done. He never seemed to have any enthusiasm or rational ideas of how to convince anyone that he was from the future, barely made any references to having lived through the time period he was in, although this wasn't helped by him often being in a state barely able to speak. I never had an understanding of why Crowe was in prison in 2030 odd, infact only knew he was due to the cover of the video telling me. There was also the cliched ""No-one believes the main bloke's protests"" characters, made out as baddies.<br/><br/>The 1st half of the film in far too slow, it picked up a lot in the 2nd half (although I'd had a kip in between), but even the 2nd half was let down by an ending the viewer could peg, infact almost knew, way in advance and an end scenario that I couldn't help thinking could have been avoided given how much was known already? Maybe that's the point that, it was unavoidable, I don't know?<br/><br/>Of the people that give this 10/10 I can't believe any 2 of them have the same interpretation of EXACTLY what went on, particularly what would've went on after the film ended. That's not necessarily a fault as I'm all for interpreting films in your own way. It does however leave films like this open to countless plot holes or chasms, especially when you have a film like Twelve Monkeys that seems to ask the viewer to suspend disbelief but at the same time contains a highly complex plot.<br/><br/>I would've liked to have seen more time devoted to the future, at the start of the film, as we never seemed to have enough understanding of it as the film went on. It wasn't an awful film though. I give it 5/10 and usually with films of that score I have an equal amount of good & bad to say about it. Whilst this has good points, it's just a subject that could've been tackled so so much better, slightly more straight forward, with better acting, more likeable characters & with scenery & cinematography less dark & depressing, it looked almost post-apocalyptic in 1996.<br/><br/>I would point fans of these films in the direction of the TV show Jonathan Creek as how highly complex stories can be tackled in a way that is both straightforward, but requiring intelligent thinking.<br/><br/>I have only watched this once though. I reckon with one or two more viewings, little things will become clearer, lines I missed will be heard and I'll have a fuller grasp of it but I can't see it going up any more than another 2 marks.<br/><br/>A low 5/10"

Everyone seems to be confused about what's going on and what to do about it. That's because no one is smart enough to ask simple questions. Madeline Stowe, playing a psychiatrist, seems as if her lines were written by an 8th grader who thought they knew enough to write a script about someone with a Doctorate. <br/><br/>The casting was alright and the stars did their best, but Brad Pitt being nominated for an Academy Award for his role, shows just how weak the year was for decent movies.

It's just Cole imagination, he is crazy guy same with Jeffrey. But suddenly the story change when Dr. Rilley found fact that Cole really do time travel. She even help Cole finishing his mission. So the story begin with their struggle. <br/><br/>This movies seems giving us a lot of puzzle... how can Jeffry release from hospital and suddenly become 12 monkeys leader? We know he is crazy guy. Again, the story try convinced us with Jeffry want spread the virus so Cole and Rilley try to stop them... but the fact he is not... what he's doing? His insane just for animal freedom... and who is the real enemy?? The Dr. Goines' assistant.. what the hell... that guy just show in short time suddenly become the real enemy WITHOUT EXPLANATION!<br/><br/>And the worse thing ever in Aiport scene. After almost 2 hours this film run and guess what... their struggle FAILED WITHOUT SOLUTION! Come on 5 million people going to die when the virus spread but what we got... Just Cole die in policeman's hand when he try to stop Dr. Goines' assistant runaway... after that what the police doing? nothing, what Rilley doing? nothing... the policemen even don't suspicious or try to find out about the happened... and this movie ending without problem solving. We even don't get news about Jeffrey and the gang or even Dr. Goines himself.<br/><br/>I can say this film may be the best performance by Bruce Willis in his whole career but his acting can't save this story. Very surprising watch Brad Pitt act like that, he give great performance but a little bit overacting sometimes. I love the girl who play Dr. Rilley, so beautiful. But I have big complaint why they put Christopher Plummer here ? He did good job as supporting actor but his character as Dr. Groines is useless and not worthy.

"Cineanalyst","6","1","5","1 April 2020"," The Jetty Revisited
","""Twelve Monkeys"" is about remembering. The time travel is an extension of this--revisiting the past, before most of humanity was wiped out by disease and the survivors imprisoned underground. As a remake of the 1962 short film ""Le Jetée"" (1962), there's also the memory of this past film. The twist in this revision from Terry Gilliam and company is the suggestion that remembrance, as viewed through the perspective of Bruce Willis's protagonist, may be mad and, thus, unreliable, which plays into the director's penchant for canted angles and otherwise strange camerawork and production design.<br/><br/>One setting in particular, besides the airport, plays well into the remembrance aspect of the scenario as the time traveler visits it in present and past. The asylum stands out, too, and helps question the reliability of the protagonist's perspective, with Brad Pitt, as another madman becoming the subject of obsession for Willis's character, providing an especially apt energetic and over-the-top performance. Meanwhile, the underground reminds one of Gilliam's prior ""Brazil"" (1895). And a WWI photograph recalls the reliance on still photography in ""La Jetée,"" which are otherwise replaced in ""Twelve Monkeys,"" along with viral pandemic instead of the threat of nuclear apocalypse, by erratic movement--actorly, cinematographically, along with the continued time shifts--within twisted spaces."
"registers-944-48791","4","1","5","29 January 2020"," Lack of coherence
","I see many people love this movie, I don't see why. It has some huge star actors, yes, but that doesn't make a movie good.<br/><br/>First half of it, it's so boring that I kept stopping to go do other things, and it took me 2 days to finish it.<br/><br/>When the movie finally gets running, I notice some incoherences on it. Cole is sent way too the past, and there's no explanation on why. Ok, I can live with this, but then he goes on a mental institution. Why in the world would he tell anybody about the apocalyptic future and that he's in the past? And who pays the bills for him to be interned? He doesn't seem to have committed any crime to be locked as a dangerous crazy criminal. I understand that, from meta, the basis for the movie is that a supposed crazy guy locked on some institution would be in fact somebody from the future warning about it, but there still needs to be a reason for him to be locked.<br/><br/>Then, he starts repeating that he can't change the past and can't stop the event from happening. Again, if he's not willing to undo it or warn about it, why then talk about it to anybody at all? Why take the risk?<br/><br/>And when things finally start making some sense, they discover who the actual terrorist is, and tries to stop him. But wouldn't that be impossible? I personally don't like this hypothesis that somebody traveling to the past is unable to change it. If that's the case, then traveling to the past would be the actual impossibility. If somehow a person can go back, he can do whatever he's able to, and with some minimal information he should indeed be able to change things and influence people. But, anyway, if in the movie that's impossible, then why try? If it's impossible, he could be just close to the terrorist, and still some mystical thing would happen and he'd fail. He just got himself killed for nothing.<br/><br/>Finally, the future organization that handles everything seems to be reasonably well organized on the past. They have some minimal company with a phone that records messages from people they send, they are able to find Cole from a call he did 30 years ago. Hey, the world almost ended, remaining mankind had to move underground, and still they have records of all calls done and are able to track where those calls come from? If they have this structure, why not use it to effectively track the terrorists and stop them?<br/><br/>No, they are more worried to spend their resources hunting Cole, than to hunt the terrorist who caused everything, or at least the original virus.<br/><br/>Last one, they say that the original virus mutated, and they need the original one to find a cure. From the little knowledge I have about biology, that makes no sense at all. First, if a virus mutates, the cure for its original form may stop working, not the opposite. Second, the pre-mutated virus shouldn't be needed to find a cure for the current one. Third, the few survivors should be immune from the virus, so why were they forced to move underground? Civilization should be a mess, yes, but they should be able to breath pretty fine the contaminated air."

Of course, something goes wrong, and he winds up in a mental institution. He meets Brad Pitt, a literally raving lunatic, and Christopher Plummer and Madeleine Stowe, psychologists at the hospital.<br/><br/>From there, my memory grows hazy.

The character James Cole was a distasteful fellow and spoiled the movie from the outset, because of his psychotic behavior and the scenes in the asylum. The role of Kathryn Railly, on the other hand, saved this film for her strong performance. The twist in the film, although good sci-fi, is not that clear at the end.

I just can't get my arms around this one.<br/><br/>One of my problems with it is the time travel aspect.  I don't believe in time travel.  I find it impossible to believe that the cosmos are marks on the tape of time.  Events define time; time doesn't define events.  And in the entertainment cosmos, time travel is used too much as a device of convenience.  In Twelve Monkeys, Bruce Willis' character is sent back to a time when a deadly agent is released around the globe resulting in the deaths of 5 billion.  Confusingly, he can't alter events but is only expected to retrieve a sample of the agent to take back to his present.<br/><br/>Another big problem is the Brad Pitt character.  Movies love the giddy and manic crazy person.  Brad Pitt is this - too much so.  It's so apparent that Brad is acting crazy although in his defense, I don't know what actor could do better.  What's worse is his character is a leader of a group of activists which is absurd.  Insanity is a sad and lonely place."

"cfish-4","6","1","7","22 January 2015"," Not an interesting story
","I like the art direction. Not too impressive in today's standards, but even in 1996, there were many movies with far more impressive scenes, computer graphics or not. The story is not interesting nor confusing to me. <br/><br/>Here's the spoiler and my opinion on ""what happened"" in this movie: <br/><br/>The very first scene of the movie quotes a mental hospital patient's words - the whole story of twelve monkeys. Seeing this film with an understanding of schizophrenia's hallucination and paranoia, I think it's clear that the entire movie is in a patient's mind. A mental patient's attachment to his psychiatrist. And, many of these patients think other patients are insane and they are the only sane person in a dangerous situation that nobody else understands - paranoia. Brad Pitt's performance, for example, as a fellow patient, is simply over the top and, well, improbable. In fact, the whole thing in the mental hospital was simply exaggerated, not anything like the reality, because it's seen through a patient's mind - everybody is insane but himself. <br/><br/>So throughout this movie I find myself shaking my head thinking how bad the protagonist's hallucination is. The movie is crystal clear in this backdrop, and I honestly can't give high regards to a movie that basically depict a hallucination."

The idea for this movie is decent. However, this movie is just awful because for almost the entire movie was just engulfed with dialogs and long boring sill dialogs.

","I enjoy almost any sort of SF but this had too much of the parody about it for me to really enjoy. The other thing is that I go to the movies to escape from the madhouse, not be immersed in it.<br/><br/>The story is interesting, it's the presentation which spoiled it for me. In 1996, a virus decimates humanity, killing 5 billion and leaving a mere 50 million who are forced to seek refuge underground - non-human animals once again rule the surface of the earth.<br/><br/>Convict James Ross (Willis) is sent back from 2036 to try to find the cause and help prevent the disaster as well as gain a pardon for himself. An animal-rights group called the 12 Monkeys is the focus for scrutiny - after all it's people like that who'd want animals to rule, right?.<br/><br/>Unfortunately time-travel has a few quirks (or is it his nutter overseers running the show) and he arrives in 1990. There he engages with psychiatrist Railly (Stowe), eventually kidnapping her and fleeing as fugitives. In this first engagement Ross is quite convinced of the reality of his mission, as much as Railly is convinced he is delusional.<br/><br/>He is pulled back to 2036, then resent to the correct time 1990 (after a WWI hiccup during which he is shot). Again he engages with Railly but this time it's she who begins to realise he was telling the truth and that humanity is in deadly peril. Ross however, begins to think he is in fact delusional and that it is all a fantastic construct existing only in his mind. After a struggle, she manages to convince him otherwise.<br/><br/>Tracking down the animal libbers led by the insane Goines (Pitt), the pair find they are relatively harmless, simply releasing all the zoo animals into the city. The real danger lurks with Peters (Morse), coworker with Goines' brilliant virologist father (Plummer).<br/><br/>In the airport scene finale, seen many times throughout the movie but never until then explained, Ross (from 2036) tries to stop Peters and his briefcase full of virus-filled vials, but is shot by the authorities while he (Ross as a child) looks on. So Peters escapes to begin his deadly virus-releasing tour.<br/><br/>And there's the silliness of it - so this time at least, it was pointless. The good guy Ross gets shot and probably killed, the bad guy Peters escapes to wreak havoc on the world, the sort of reverse outcome which many people expect and which makes good box-office these days. But if you have time-travel at your disposal, there's nothing to stop you trying again and again until you produce the outcome you want.<br/><br/>Parody - not serious SF or thriller."

","As far as psychological thrillers go, I guess 12 Monkeys is one of the better ones. However, I would have to question whether it deserves the acclaim it received. The concept is exciting, and considering this is from the mid-90s, I guess its fairly original too. Unfortunately, the film is let down by some sloppy character development and a very rushed ending that feels like an afterthought and devalues the entire viewing experience.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a Bruce Willis fan but I quite liked him in this movie. The role is a good fit for his style and he carries the film very nicely for the most part. I did feel there was some very inconsistent writing of his character however, as we see him inexplicably transform from being barely conscious and almost illegible to suddenly turning into a nineties Jack Bauer. As for Brad Pitt, well it's certainly a fun performance and one of the most enjoyable aspects of the film, but the Oscar nomination is probably a bit of an overreaction. His twitchy manic qualities are just a shade too excessive and make his character almost cartoonish.<br/><br/>Overall, I quite liked the pacing, the atmosphere and the lead performances. The plot was intriguing but unfortunately it unravelled somewhat towards the end. A very compelling time-travel dystopic that just falls a bit short in places."
"gabriellepak","5","0","6","2 April 2020"," Is this film serious? Or am I stupid?
","The film is beautiful, the aesthetics and cinematography is right up my alley, and Brad Pitt's performance is, as usual, underrated as hell.<br/><br/>But I was left feeling like I'm stupid.<br/><br/>I could not for the life of me take this movie or any of the characters seriously. By the end I ended up with my own theory, and that is the boy we see at the start, the end, and in James' dreams being traumatized by the shooting and making up stories in his head of what happened and why it happened in order to cope. What really gave me this idea is a bunch of different things. One is a scene where James' character is in some kind of hospital bed, surrounded by the scientists congratulating him, and the female scientist covers him up with a child's blanket. Throughout the story I also thought that Dr. Railly is actually his mother, and the man that gets shot in the vision is his father, whose face we never see, and I thought the woman and the man in the vision looked very 70s...<br/><br/>Basically, what I am saying is that I think James really is crazy and institutionalized, and that the film is about him beginning to realize that he is insane. The virus itself is an infection of the mind. The surface is the conscious mind/awareness, and him ""time-traveling"" is really him coming into lucidity about reality. Another clue is about how he begins to question his sanity the more time he spends in ""the past""...<br/><br/>I mean. Listen. IF this film is not at all serious, and is actually about madness or a schizophrenic man's perspective of reality, then it is genius. But if this is some convoluted story about actual time-time travel and an actual virus, then I'm way over my head. If this is ALL happening in James' head, then I would give it 7/8 stars, but my interpretation seems unpopular and most reviewers take this film seriously for some reason... If this film is meant to be taken seriously then I'd give it 2 stars.<br/><br/>So I'll settle on 5 for now. I need more evidence to support my theory that the story is bogus and James is a mentally crazy person who is ""curing"" his mental illness by the process of rationalizing childhood trauma."

","Right before the climax of the movie, Bruce Willis' character hugs his partner in crime, the woman he's in love with, and whispers to her that he's scared. The next shot is a cinema usher snoring. Literally. That pretty much sums up the whole film<br/><br/>The tone is too inconsistent for it to be a dark, foreboding sci-fi movie. It's even comical at times, like Brad Pitt's Golden Raspberry-worthy performance, the quirky, post-apocalyptic prison officers, those ridiculous wigs and outfits that the characters used to disguise themselves at the airport... Almost felt like a parody, albeit not funny. It's also too lethargic, passive and spineless to be an action movie. Doesn't work as a romance eiher, as the love affair is lukewarm and unconvicing. There's zero chemistry between the two actors and the connection the characters are supposed to be sharing is communicated to us without heart or spark. It basically boils down to Stockholm Syndrome. So, what box does this movie even tick?<br/><br/>There are no captivating moments, no spikes. The whole movie is just a flat line that keeps throwing random things in my face without a build-up and without any significance. I'm pretty sure I was supposed to be shocked or at least intrigued when it was revealed that the titular group, that we had spent about 100 minutes focusing on, were nothing but a red herring only for a random character that had been awkwardly presented about an hour in advance to be revealed as the real culprit. I... didn't flinch. It just happened, like all the other things that just happened in all 3 worlds that the movie tried (and failed) to construct.<br/><br/>La Jetee, the atmospheric masterpiece this atrocity took its main storyline from, captures the inconceivable power of time travel, the agony of (hopeless) love and the cruelty of humanity in a little over 20 minutes. This movie takes 6 times as long to butcher it. It sucks every bit of soul out of it, over-stuffs it with useless characters and useless subplots, buries the heart of the story under endless deviations, twists and turns that it couldn't set up in a proper and enticing manner and devalues every single element of the original that it touches, from the zoo (that it incorporates just for the sake of it to create its worst and most ridiculous subplot) to the haunting image of the post-apocalyptic underground world. And on top of all that, it makes off with an 8.0 rating.<br/><br/>If I could travel back in time, I would make sure this didn't get funded."

","To think! This was Terry Gilliams best selling movie to date. Twelve Monkeys is a creative, mind blowing, and very twisted tale that is prepared to mess around with your head for a few hours. ( It's what Terrys great at!) Bruce Willis is offered early parole, at a great cost....he must go back to the year 1996 to gather information on why the human population was almost completely wiped out. He goes back in time. Here's the kicker: He's in the wrong year! He's in the year 1990, and he's still trying to gather the information he needs. He returns to the year 2030 something, only to tell them that he wasn't in the year 1996, he was in the year 1990. He's asked if he wants to go back. At this point, were at the 45 minute mark to the movie. Twelve Monkeys makes it clear that this is NOT a time travel film such as The Terminator. Hence, in Terminator, they went back in time to prevent something from happening. Twelve Monkeys makes it clear that this event cannot be prevented, because its already happened, they're just looking for information as to what caused the problem. And you send him to the wrong year. Or was that the right year, and you wanted information from both years? See what I mean! This movie jacks with your brain a little bit. I'm cool with it, and I love the unique formula. However, there is just something incredibly annoying and confusing about Twelve Monkeys. It's complex, its' compelling, it's damn fun and entertaining to watch. So where's the problem? Well, there's not really any clear answers to our questions, especially when the film ends with its ( I don't dare spoil it!) ending. The viewer is left to their own devices to decide for themselves what they've watched. What's real, what's not, is any of it real, was the whole film just a dream, etc, etc, etc. Your left trying to find the missing pieces of the puzzle, never finding them, and you're trying to figure and make sense out of everything and nothing, which is flipping annoying if you ask me! Solid performances, cast and crew were great, the movie never drags or slags, doesn't bore you for one minute ( this is what I love about all of Terry Gilliams films), and when its all over, oh, you're going to be SHOCKED by the ending. I don't know, Twelve Monkeys. You work, but I don't know how you work. Trial and error. Maybe. I just have one question left unanswered about your movie. Twelve Monkeys. Which one of the twelve wrote your script?"

I suppose it was unique enough and original enough to keep me entertained.

But the best thing about the film was Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Let me clarify. I am not a huge Bruce Willis fan by any means. I like him in some things and dislike him in others. But the thing that made this role so good for him was that it allowed him to branch out. People, this is Bruce Willis like you have never seen him before.

","A deadly virus released in 1996 wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing remaining survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to be behind the release of the virus. In 2035, James Cole (Willis) is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected for a mission, where he is trained and sent back in time to locate the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure.[3] Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and an airport shooting.<br/><br/>Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Stowe). There he encounters Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), a mental patient with fanatical views. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears moments later, and wakes up back in his own time. Cole is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield of World War I where he is shot in the leg, and then he is suddenly transported to 1996."

It's not totally bad though, as some of the performances are pretty good, except Willis, who once again fails to impress me at all. Brad Pitt is like the biggest reason to see this, and I just wish he had more screen time but as it is he infuses his scenes with a sort of wacky thrill and energy that the rest of the film is missing. This is definitely one of his best performances, and it's nice to see some greatness from him even this early on. This is not really recommended."

It's nice to sometimes see a time travel movie where the time travel is done not just once or twice, just like in this one. This movie incorporates a nice story flow that tells the story different bits at a time that will only be clear at the ending part. And when it clears out, it's a full circle. I love to see how Brad Pitt gets totally into character in this movie. Bruce Willis also did okay with his part, although many would agree with me that he lost his action side here."
"sophia-tsopia-tsopana","7","0","1","6 June 2013"," To change the future you must know the past
","In Twelve monkeys, a disease killed almost the whole world population in 1996. Everybody who survived lives under the ground to make sure they won't get the disease. However, they want to live above ground again, but obviously if they go there they will get infected by the virus. To avoid that from happening they have to make an anti-virus. They send prisoners into the past to trace the path of the virus and find out more about it, so they can make the anti-virus and live on the surface of the Earth again. James Cole is one of the prisoners and gets sent into the past, but he gets sent to the wrong year. He is declared crazy because he says he's from the future and gets locked into a house for crazy people. When the scientists from the 'future' find out that he was sent to the wrong year, they sent him to the right year. Still, no one believes him, until one person finally does believe him and tries to help him. Now, let's take a look at the narrative form of the film. The dramatic structure is a four-part structure; it has a rising action, climax, falling action and a resolution. That is also what makes this movie great to watch because there is a huge climbing action part where we actually get to know the characters and the story develops. Then almost at the end of the movie there is a very abrupt, but very exciting climax. It's a linear narrative form, so in this case the fabula and syuzhet are both the same as the plot. It might seem that it isn't chronological, because the time traveling and dreams make it look like there are flashbacks and flash forwards, but from James' perspective everything happens in chronological order. Also Terry Gilliam chose to use the first persons view, the whole story is told from Willis perspective. Using this technique also makes the watcher confused because you're not shore whether you can trust Willis or not (because you obviously don't know what the other actors are thinking).The confusion this causes also builds up tension and makes the movie exciting to watch. This means that perspective is really important in this film. You could also argue that it is a nonlinear narrative form, but if I'd explain why I'd spoil the movie. The film is also non- diegetic, because there is no story teller involved. One would say it has an open ending, which leaves room for imagination, but I am still not sure whether I should say that the movie twelve monkeys has an open or closed ending. This is because most questions I asked myself at the beginning of the movie where answered at the end. However, still some parts are missing and you will never be completely sure what happened after the ending of the movie. As the plot is so complicated and completely incomprehensible for the watcher at the start, there has to be a way in which all the pieces will fall together in the end. Terry Gilliam used some very clever techniques in his movie as well by starting the movie with Cole's dream. When being introduced to that very first scene, it doesn't make any sense. But as the dream keeps reappearing throughout the movie, each time we see it, we understand a bit more of it. This goes on until the end, where, when we see the full dream for the last time, it all makes sense. This way of unfolding and explaining the plot is very interesting. The overall light and color used in the movie is a bit ""depressing""; the saturation is quite low which creates this mood. Most of the movie uses front light, just like normal daylight caused by the sun. Not many complicated light and color techniques are used, to avoid the watcher from getting distracted from the plot, which is very complicated and needs the entire watcher's attention to be understood. This is a very intelligently done. What Gilliam also does is moving the camera around very fast. The key to making the movie interesting is by making the watcher confused and therefore making him want to understand the movie and see how it ends. Terry Gilliam definitely succeeded in making it interesting with this sixth technique. Overall, my opinion about the movie had several points of view. Even though for me the movie wasn't what I usually like to watch, I could come to the following conclusion: The movie has an incredibly original plot, and the way it is presented to the watcher is very interesting in a complicated way. It is a movie anyone could watch, and I would recommend it to a broad audience; a lot of action and quite some violence is involved, some science-fiction (because of the time traveling), mystery, all blended into one movie, so anyone who likes those kind of movies can watch it. One thing is missing; romanticism. There is barely any romance in the movie, and this is what may already make the movie less interesting for part of the female audience."

He is sent back, before the disease plagues the world and eliminates most of the entire human race, to gather information about how it happened, why it happened, and who was involved.<br/><br/>I watched this film under the impression that it was going to be amazing. It isn't quite ""amazing"" but it's still pretty good. The story line is very clever and innovative. The script was well written, the acting was great especially from Brad Pitt, who is usually great in most things. The directing was cool, with some nice, tricky shots that I quite liked.

","Before I saw this movie I thought it would be great I'm interested in sci-fi or back to the future etc. The problem is the movie is predictable and it was obvious that everything Bruce Will's character(James Cole) did no matter how he change it, would remain the same. From beginning to the end, virus is released no matter what happens.<br/><br/>The movie was too B-grade characters ordinary, music dull, dialogue is very average nothing interesting. They don't cover philosophy, science, physics, consequences or technical terms so the movie is very dull. I would recommend Deja Vu or Paycheck both good movies with better story and characters. IMDb has overrated this movie like Seven and I think its because of Brad Pitt or people just like straightforward plots if you like that then watch this movie."

","While not thoroughly outstanding in memory, Twelve Monkeys will always remain at an extravagant limbo of my mind, emerging constantly to exemplify my preferences concerning films.

Confused, eccentric characters, dealing with intricate situations on an austere, decaying atmosphere.<br/><br/>Chances are, out of the billions of films that incorporate these characteristics, this one was the first to be analyzed by me with a critical eye. For this sole reason, my overall impression must have been impaired, and a good movie, perfectly enjoyable, suddenly becomes a term of reference for all ''time-travel, mind bending, dystopian science-fiction'' that insists on popping up in my conversations.<br/><br/>Inexplicably, the 2 hours and 11 minutes of original plot, excellent acting from top performers, impeccable direction from one of my favorite directors, with a rare appropriate conclusion, have simply failed to seduce me entirely. Twelve Monkeys is therefore doomed to be considered only ''good'', despite all undeniable achievements and fortuitous distinction marked on my brain.

","Like BACK TO THE FUTURE II with Biff in charge forever.<br/><br/>Another Terry Gilliam dystopian vision, 12 MONKEYS (inspired by French short film LA JETÉE and modeled after Gilliam's own inimitable BRAZIL), is a claustrophobic, strangling, time-paradox action stunner; like all Gilliam's films, it's also completely off the rails.<br/><br/>A subterranean Orwellian Earth culture in the year 2035 sends a prisoner back in time to observe and report on, and perhaps stop the spread of, a human-created virus that killed 90% of life on the surface.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is prisoner James Cole, serving his government overlords by being sent back to 1996, the time in Earth history that the alleged ""Army of the 12 Monkeys"" supposedly released the virus. Cole ends up getting sent back time and again, either years too early or too late, often meeting psychologist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) and then being dragged Back To The Future, as it were, and becoming ever more dazed and hallucinatory as to what is real, what is memory, what is past, what is future, and what the hell Brad Pitt is doing.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is Jeffrey, who meets Cole in an insane asylum (in an extended sequence that obviously builds on the primal fear created in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST - that of being sane and accused of being otherwise with no way to prove it). Jeffrey may be connected with the Army of the 12 Monkeys or may just be a twitchy wacktologist. Pitt is a keg of dynamite, frenetically showcasing a mad dog performance, his pretty face a carnival monster here through his own contortions and his crazy-eye. Alongside Willis's characteristic underplaying, Pitt is like an explosion in a German cheese factory.<br/><br/>David Morse is one of the ominous future scientists; Frank Gorshin (The Riddler from the 1960's BATMAN) is a doctor in the asylum, and Christopher Plummer makes an appearance as Jeffrey's millionaire dad.<br/><br/>The only performance lacking is that of Madeline Stowe as the confused psychologist, who aids Cole in his quest to reveal the 12 Monkeys insurrectionist group. With Willis and Pitt and every day player conveying the film's sense of Damoclean doom, Stowe cannot embrace the necessary gravitas required for her integral role. She becomes more a plot device than a character - the person who fills in information for Cole when he needs to know the year or a street name. (Some A-List director or movie exec once described Madeline Stowe's beauty: ""Even if she opened her legs, you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off her face."" Wow, what a compliment!... I think. Praising a woman's beauty by invoking visions of her open labia. Well, if she's proving such a lazy actor, I guess she's still got her face and labia to fall back on.) <br/><br/>To outline the story's beautiful circular construction would be to reveal too much; suffice to say that Cole remembers, as a boy, seeing a melee at an airport, a lady screaming, a man gunned down. His future will be inextricably linked with these events time and again. And the desolate soundtrack (by Paul Buckmaster) complements well the grim story of a man forever manipulated into a tragic time-loop.<br/><br/>12 MONKEYS is rife with interesting ideas, such as Railly's lecture on prophets actually being time travelers; déjà vu, in which a future event is ""remembered"" by Railly and Cole as it happens to them; the Christ mythos, in the form of James Cole (J.C. huh?) who sacrifices his life for the salvation of humanity...<br/><br/>Under different circumstances, the title theme would be considered a quirky, cute accordion line, rather than evoking a disturbing monkey jumping around on your brain.<br/><br/>Does your minkey bayt?"

","Twelve Monkeys was pretty good. Obviously, there are some inconclusive plot holes and not everything adds up. But, to be honest, I was much too distracted by the fantastic acting and captivating storyline to be meticulous with details. The concept, while typical (life after people, apocalyptic scenarios, etc.) is really intriguing. This is what contributes to its overall appealthe fact that something so ordinary can be so fantastic.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not a fan of Brad Pittat all. I mean, don't get me wrong, he's rather attractive and a millionairebut I find his acting performances pretty terrible. However, in this moviehe was just phenomenal. I mean, just fantastic. I honestly believed that he was a raving, rambling lunatic and thought he deserved to be locked in an asylum. The best part about his character overall is the simple fact that he is nothing more than a distractiona distraction to James, the future, and to the audience. By being such an attention seeker, we are naturally drawn to him, listening to his nonsensical words and watching his crazed behavior. Especially when Jeffery was placed next to James; a dismal, catatonic character whom is the epitome of psychotic, it's much easier for the audience to be entertained by Jeffery then be bored by James. Not to mention, he's a distraction from the entire virus conspiracy. We are so quick to assume it's the radical group of the Twelve Monkeys that we don't even stop to consider the others who have access to those other bacteria specimens could have ulterior motives.<br/><br/>The ending was probably the most frustrating moment for me. It was one of those endings that had to happen. It wouldn't make sense if James and Catherine jumped right on a plane, and spent the remainder of their days sipping margaritas on a beach in Key West. In fact, it would've been a waste of two and a half hours. However, you get so invested in these characters, and their strange story that you want to see them succeed. The most painful piece of the entire movie is that at the end, we're left to ponder the idea that this will keep repeating itself over and over, without any hope of anything changing. You can't change the pastor, at least that's what we, the audience, need to believe."
"arthera09","7","0","2","4 June 2011"," story vs artistic vision
","This is the type of movie that suffers from a clash of imagination and story telling. At the heart of this movie is an interesting take on time travel that suffers from the fact that the director's vision drew from the simplicity and elegance of the story. I want to love Gilliam, but it is not an easy task. <br/><br/>The story is a fairly simple tale of time travel that ends with a sufficient number of twists and turns to make it interesting and to keep the audience guessing. The execution of that story on the other hand left me unsatisfied. There were certain aspects of the movie and specifically themes that I wish the director emphasized more. The idea that Cole could have been crazy and that everything was just in his head was barely touched upon and when it was it seemed like it was tacked on. I thought that one of the main ideas was that Cole could not change the past and that we would be forced to live the nightmare over and over again was not emphasized enough. <br/><br/>Instead of making sure that the themes emerged it seems that Gilliam decided to focus on more visually inventive aspects of the movie. I did enjoy the design of the future, but it was too stylized for it to fit the rest of the story. The present wasn't overly stylized so it did not seem like the future fit into the same universe as the present.<br/><br/>The acting was really good and I really enjoyed watching Brad Pitt play against type. Willis was good, but there was nothing special. Stowe on the other hand I thought was perfect. She was sympathetic all the while being strong willed. There is a beauty that radiates from her eyes and I would to see her some more dramatic roles. <br/><br/>There are some strong points for this movie and it was definitely a Gilliam film. I do not think he had to compromise his artistic vision too much, which I believe hurt the movie. I do love time travel movies, but there was not a lot of connections of the present to the future, which took away from the fact that it was a time travel movie."

","Inspired by the French short film 'La Jetée', '12 Monkeys', directed by Terry Gilliam, is a film that belongs to all. It gives birth to an idea, a virus, that will appeal to all. But the only problem is.... I don't know how many would really understand this one? I mostly did, and I must say... I enjoyed myself! <br/><br/>'12 Monkeys' is an epidemic call for us. Human-Kind is getting wiped out by a virus. The remaining left have gone nuts. Now add a Hero, a Heroine, supporting characters and a conniving villain. And here it is... you've successfully entered this mad-mad-mad world.<br/><br/>'12 Monkeys' begins with a BANG. The entire 1st hour, is amongst the best I've seen from the 90's. It's that good. But, the second hour plays a spoilsport. The goings get confusing, and the culmination is the weakest link. It may be damn new in terms of ending a story, but I somehow, couldn't grasp it.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam's direction is first-class. The screenplay is generally superb, but gets confused mid-way. Music by Paul Buckmaster, is haunting. Roger Pratt's Camera-Work is worth a mention.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Bruce Willis is good. Brad Pitt is the show-stealer. The star-actor is superb in a role that is very difficult to execute. Madeleine Stowe is another topper. She's in terrific form. Christopher Plummer, as always, is perfect.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is some real weird/good/absurd stuff that has a lot going for it. Strongly recommended!"
"meighe03","7","0","1","31 July 2010"," A struggle for human dignity and the human race.
","After watching the 12 Monkeys, it is to say that it portrays a central idea of humankind's basic struggle to hold on to human dignity.c struggle to hold on to human dignity.This film is based on a focused theme of would be hero James Cole,portrayed by actor Bruce Willis in the age-old struggle of one against an endless amount of insurmountable odds and conflicts in order to save the world from the would be destruction of life as we know it and most of the human race, if not all. This movie's hero must travel back in time to save the futures along the same lines as in the James Cameron 1994 Terminator movie when John Connor sends a cyborg back into the past from the future. Of course machines are not going to take over, but a virus of unknown origin has eradicated five billion human kind and those who haven't perished must now dwell underground as Earth is once again ran by the animal kingdom. Therefore, the theme is a focus on the plot and most importantly the ending scene. This theme is generally present in most of the film. For instance, in a twist of dramatic irony James Cole finds himself not only at the wrong time in history to find the necessary information on the army of the 12 monkeys needed to produce an antidote for the virus that erases millions from the human race, but placed so far back in history that he is in the middle of World War 1. Additionally, the final airport scene in the movie provides another twist of fate as the trip here is not even about Cole seeking information to cure the virus, but of him following orders from the government. Although the title and main focus of monkey symbolism throughout this movie finds its main depiction with images of the 12 Monkeys animal activist group, the monkey symbolism presents itself quite frequently with references in the course of the film's dialog. This means any object can serve to evoke a new association for movie watchers. Gillian proves this art works. For example, in one of Cole's flashbacks co-patient Jeffery Goines chants, ""Monkey! Monkey! No more monkey business!"" Additionally, although Goines is the very creator of the 12 Monkeys army, he exclaims that, ""I hadn't thought of the 12 monkeys yet"" (Gilliam, 1995). It is this type of motif that gives the 12 Monkeys film the unique symbolism of monkeys to bring the mystery flashbacks further together. A sub-theme of symbolism is the ""Cassandra Syndrome"" that suggests the Earth is not capable of sustaining the ever growing population of humankind and some cataclysmic event must end the problem. Along with the symbolism, the screenwriter uses the time travel paradox to promote the plot of hero. For instance, around the time James takes his third journey he begins to doubt his saneness. He has accepted the fact that he is indeed mad and needs help. James has made the vow that he likes the past, belongs in the past, loves his doctor, and wants to breathe the above ground outside air. However, his psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly has extracted a tangible object from the past, witnessed monkey symbolism in action and now believes that he is indeed very sane and on a mission. She insists that he must continue on his quest and she will help him. Just such dramatic irony adds the unexpected mystery of the film. In conclusion, the theme's importance in the film is astronomical. In the same way jelly goes with peanut butter, the theme of this film engages the viewer in the story. Throughout the ages, the greatest storytellers have told the story of the world's demise. Usually one dynamic character fights for the world while keeping the human distinction when it would be so much easier to give in to the conflict. The 12 Monkeys fulfills this art of storytelling by use of its theme. What's more, as the theme conveys all along, the story holds its final surprise until the ending scene when the scientist from the future is the passenger sitting next to the bio-terrorist, and so the theme goes on. Is the ""Cassandra Syndrome"" true, will James Cole continue to travel time unable to stop the demise of millions, can anyone ever win against these odds, or will the scientists prevail with a sample of destruction from the plane(Gilliam, 1995)?<br/><br/>References Cameron, J.

","The quality of the film is very well done on several aspects. (1) The story is cemented around the concept that space/time is not relevant. Space/time is fixed from the perspective of the creator and not the created. This explains the scientist's trouble with time travel, and the human mind experiencing issues with traveling. Our perspective is skewed. I think this is part of the appeal of the film. Note how H.G. Wells placed his time travel story, The Time Machine, into a cold and Godless universe. The main character in 12 Monkeys is not alone. He has the psychiatrist and the team of people from 2035. Pitt's character is made interesting because the character plays off of most people assuming that anyone who is passionate about an issue, animals in this case, is mentally unstable and capable of violence. I see the media warp this perspective often. (2) I like all of the architecture and animals. The feel of the film is very correct for the story. (3) Just as Othello is a dark twist to the Book of Esther, this film seems to work work a twist to Joseph's story featured around him keeping the correct perspective as he interacts through events. (4) If you like time travel stories then check out an Outer Limits episode called Tribunal. It is well worth your time."

","I have been reading postings on several websites about this movie, and it seems that everything from the roots of Egyptian civilization through Buddhist cycles of suffering and rebirth to ancient Christianity are somehow to be associated with it via a myriad of symbols and subtle hints (doves flying overhead, statues of angels, etc).<br/><br/>OK. So what? I don't deny the movie is skillfully crafted, but let's try and see it in perspective. James Cole (JC) may have been intended to ""represent"" Jesus Christ, and his mission and subsequent death to ""represent"" the coming and the crucifixion of Christ. However, anyone less Christlike is difficult to imagine. While Jesus was an intelligent and gentle man with deep insights into the politics of his time and a full awareness of the significance of his presence on Earth, James Cole is a man of moderate or even limited intelligence who is full of repressed violence, is frequently confused as to his own mental state and has limited understanding of the significance of what he is trying to achieve (and in fact a limited desire to carry his mission through). In my view, it's vitally important for humans to grasp the significance of these differences."

","""The Future Is History""<br/><br/>Lets put it this way, if you are going to make a movie that goes in a straight line but then brings you right back, this is the film to make. Twelve Monkeys is a clever, well thought out movie and has many hits and punches to it. However, with every punch, comes with a bruise. It's funny how it's so much easier for me to write about the things I didn't like about the movie as opposed to the things I did like about it.<br/><br/>Let me first try the things I did like. Twelve Monkeys took me through a sort of sci-fi-e story about a guy named James Cole (Bruce Willis), who is sent back in time by the head counsel to bring back the source of a monkey disease that kills most of the population by 1996. I'm guessing because he has a really good memory and some decent fighting skills they found he was best suited for the job. What really got interesting is when I started asking myself how would I handle James's situation by trying to explain to the people in the past that they are all going to be wiped out. It's hard to say if I would have done a better job than he did, and I would like to think that of course. The best thing about Twelve Monkeys is that it always keeps you in the dark, until it all unravels in the very end. If a movie can keep my attention throughout then I say it is worth recommending.<br/><br/>Finally, here are the problems I had. First off, I'm going to flat out say that I hate having famous actors in films. For me it kills the whole atmosphere because when you try to imagine a famous actor playing a certain character, it's hard to do that when you have seen that same person in dozens of other films. Anyway, the whole thing about going back in time kinda threw me for a loop, because it just seemed so out of place. Had they have made the past a little bit later and made the future look more futuristic, then maybe they could have pulled it off better. One thing that annoyed me is that it took the characters to the very end to find out that a tall, white, completely bald guy can stick out in a crowd, and it'd probably be best to give him a hat.<br/><br/>So to conclude it, I am going to recommend Twelve Monkeys for those who like time traveling sci-fi-ish movies with famous actors. It may not particularly be my cup of tea, but I don't regret seeing it.<br/><br/>***/**** Stars<br/><br/>Twelve Monkeys (1995): Rated R for violence and language"

","This film is about a volunteer, James Cole, has been chosen to go back in 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic that wiped out 5 billion people, which he was told was spread by the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. He mistakingly went back too far to 1990, rather than 1996. He meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert. Now he goes back to the future again and then go back to the right time. He must stop the spread or it'll be too late.<br/><br/>First of all, this film is way over rated. Yes, this film has a clever ending but that doesn't make a film good, does it? This is like any other average film that I gave 7/10 to. There's nothing special about this film.<br/><br/>Now to the acting. Bruce Willis', Madeline Stowe's, and Brad Pitt's performance was all great. I even thought this was Brad Pitt's best performance, since it's so weird, could earn him an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>This film is not like most sci-fi films. There's not CGI nor many action, since it's such a low budget. Don't expect guns and bombs in this movie. This film is very imaginative, as always by Terry Gilliam. It's very different.<br/><br/>This film is not a master piece but just an enjoyable work. There's nothing special about this film. It's smart and compelling. If you want to see a different film that is clever, go see it. It's not full of action, like other sci-fi films. Just watch this film as entertainment."

James Cole who is in prison in the year 2035 has been volunteered to go back in time and solve the mystery of the Twelve Monkeys so that the scientists in the year 2035 can find a cure for this disease that wiped out the human race so that they can move back to the surface - however the scientists haven't quite mastered their time machine meaning a few things go wrong.<br/><br/>Oh and now my summary is missing - what to put as my summary....<br/><br/>I really really like this film. The whole concept and idea is amazing. A deadly virus that wipes out the human race is amazing - and it makes you think that this could really happen.<br/><br/>The twist at the end (that shall not be mentioned) is brilliant and the whole plans of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is amazing. Brad Pitt acts brilliantly in this as a mental patient and Bruce Willis is also good. <br/><br/>The plot can be quite confusing which makes the film even better - in the fact that you have to work out how it all works. <br/><br/>Everything about the 12 monkeys is superb, but some parts do not make full sense and are inaccurate but otherwise is well worth watching.<br/><br/>Other films i recommend if you like this one is: -Donnie Darko -The Forgotten -The Ring -The Ring 2"

The depiction of time travel itself was very unique to this movie, I thought. It was shown as being disorienting, painful, frightening and difficult. Brad Pitt was inspired when he was performing the insane asylum bit. Throughout the movie, the warning for mankind to watch what it creates is prevalent- making this a good movie for most sci-fi fans and those who believe that ""our technology has exceeded our humanity""(Einstein)."

","I saw this film at least once, I obviously didn't pay the fullest attention, and I certainly didn't remember anything, so I'm glad I made a real effort to watch it again and get a better opinion, directed by Terry Gilliam (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Brazil, The Fisher King). Basically in 1996 humanity is almost wiped out by a deadly virus, remaining survivors are forced to live underground, a mysterious group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys are believed to have something to do with the virus. In 2035, in a subterranean shelter beneath the ruins of Philadelphia, prisoner James Cole (Bruce Willis) is selected for a mission, to be trained and sent back in time, he cannot change the future, but he can collect information for the scientists to help them find a cure. Cole meanwhile is haunted to recurring dreams of his childhood, involving a foot chase and a shooting in an airport. Cole arrives in Baltimore in the year 1990, not 1996, he ends up arrested and hospitalised in a mental institution, following an assessment by psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Stowe), there he encounters fellow mental patient Jeffrey Goines (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Brad Pitt) with fanatical views. Cole attempts an escape, he is caught and locked in a cell, but disappears, returning to the future, back in his own time Cole is interviewed by the scientists, they play a distorted voicemail message, which references the location of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and their association with the virus. Cole is also shown photographs of suspects who may be involved, he recognises Goines, he is given a second chance to go back in time, but another error sends him to a World War I battlefield, he is shot in the leg, but is then suddenly sent to 1996 as planned. In 1996, Railly is lecturing about the Cassandra complex to scientists, in the following book signing Dr. Peters (Morse) questions her about humanity's future and the lunacy of the gradual destruction of the environment. Cole arrives having seen flyers for the event, he kidnaps Railly and forces her to take him to Philadelphia, they learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. They set out to find him, when they confront him however Goines denies any involvement with the virus, and says to Cole that it was his idea in 1990 whilst in the asylum to wipe out humanity. Cole convinces himself that he is insane, but Railly has evidence that proves his time travel did in fact occur, they decide that with the oncoming plague to spend their remaining time in the Florida Keys, on their way to the airport they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys were not the source of the epidemic, they protested for the release of animals from the zoo. Cole leaves a message for the scientists at the airport, telling them that following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is pointless, and he will not be returning, an acquaintance from his own time, Jose (Jon Seda), confronts Cole and gives him a handgun and instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, she recognises him from a newspaper as an assistant at the virology lab of Dr. Goines (Christopher Plummer), Jeffrey's father, he is due to be touring several cities that match the locations and sequence of the virus outbreak. Cole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters, police fatally shoot Cole when he pulls out the gun he was given, as Cole is dying in Railly's arms, she sees a young boy (Joseph Melito) watching, it is James Cole as a child witnessing his own death, this will replay in his nightmarish visions, while Peters boards the plane, with the virus, and sits next to Jones (Carol Florence), one of the scientists from the future. Also starring Batman's Frank Gorshin as Dr. Fletcher, Christopher Meloni as Lt. Halperin, Joey Perillo as Detective Franki and Irma St. Paule as Poet. Willis gives a compelling performance as the man suffering great distress sent backwards and forwards in time to help save the human race, Pitt is also terrific as the twitchy leader of the group suspected of being the reason for the wipeout, I will be honest and say that the plot confused me in small moments, but it has a haunting atmosphere throughout, and the surrealist stuff works well, so overall it is a worthwhile neo-noir science- fiction mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design. Bruce Willis was number 35, and Brad Pitt number 15 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pitt was also number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 30 The World's Greatest Actors.

","Twelve Monkeys is the sort of film that not everybody has seen. You may of had the chance to see it sometime, but skipped it due to what you may have heard or read about the plot and such. Unfortunately, you've skipped something special; something very special indeed.<br/><br/>Time travel has been depicted in various ways throughout cinematic history. The classic time travel theories in Back to the Future for instance, of the clever portrayal in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Whenever we see time travel, it's being used to save something, stop something or change something so that the future can be restored and everything will be fine and dandy. Twelve Monkeys shows us a world in which time travel cannot change events, they have already happened (similar to the Harry Potter time travel, yes). Thus, the objective of our man Bruce Willis is not to change the past, but to merely collect information to bring back to the present.<br/><br/>Weeved together in a masterful way that only Gilliam could create, Twelve Monkeys gives us twist after twist, allowing us to progress along the path that the protagonist does at exactly the same rate; figuring out the story as we go. The performances are superb, especially from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. They allow us to feel involved as we are plunged into a bleak, dark world which is probably one of the most realistic I've ever seen in cinema.<br/><br/>I won't give any hints at all as to the plot; it's more enjoyable if you watch it without knowing anything at all. What I will say, is that Twelve Monkeys is one of the greatest movies out there. Watch it A.S.A.P, before something really bad happens and it's just too late...<br/><br/>(5/5)"

Willis is sent back in time to stop a virus that nearly wipes out the entire world. The problem is they send him back to the wrong date and Willis is committed.

And at this same time, someone from the future hands Willis a gun to kill this guy with. But the gun was huge, and my interpretation at the time was that the guy from the future *wanted* Willis to fail.<br/><br/>Then a few minutes later, when the real plague spreader sits down on the plane, he sits next to one of the leader's from the future.<br/><br/>So the question is, what was she doing on the plane? She was there as insurance, but was it to make sure that the plague spreader gets killed, or to make sure that he survives to start spreading the plague?Was there a group of people from the future who liked running things, and who were working to ensure that Willis *failed*?"

","This film explores the possibility that humans can control their fate. It deals with whether or not determinism is our fate. Railly questions the ""Cassandra"" premise. Cole is not a passive cog, but an active participant. The question of dogmatic creep into Science, as it has crept into Religion is probed. Gilliam's vision is indeed dangerous in a world where pursuit of Truth is shackled. This film is even more apt today than when it was first released. Cole asks:""Is this about doing what you are told?"" The film's philosophical underpinnings assert the validity of dissent, in a world that closes that possibility more each day. Like the best Sci-Fi, it is a cautionary tale. It is Universal in its Space/Time reach. The use of music is perfect! It asserts the only valid reaction to Living...LOVE...of self, of other, of Truth! It offers no easy formula, only dogged work towards that end! M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" is a close cousin to ""12 Monkeys""!"

","This is a good film that has stood the test of time. It was frankly a relief to see Willis playing somebody other than the indestructible all American hero, and he does it well. This is Willis performing at the top of his game and proving why he has been and continues to be one of Hollywood's best.<br/><br/>Supporting Willis are Madeleine Stowe and a young Brad Pitt, both of whom portray their characters superbly, Pitt is almost unrecognisable in this film and that is a credit to his ability, goofy hand gestures and the wonders of an odd haircut and moustache Directed by Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python Fame) this film twists and weaves like a snake; perhaps a little predictable at times the film is ultimately satisfying and the viewer is left with all loose ends tied up nicely. If you stick with this film, and watch closely you can pick up the clues that Gilliam has scattered around with reckless abandon, and that makes it all the more satisfying for all concerned. The ending is possibly one of the best that Hollywood has produced and Kudos to the script writers for a wonderfully slippy and ephemeral script.<br/><br/>If you want a good night in; grab yourself some popcorn, prepare to concentrate slightly more than normal and kick back for some excellent mid-nineties time travel.<br/><br/>A well deserved 7/10.

","To me this film was a bit of a disappointment. Definitely not a bad film but the feel of it doesn't seem to sit comfortably. For a start it's a rip-off of La Jetee (and this is admitted in the titles at the start). La Jetee was very artistic with no real pretentions to be any sort of adventure film. The Twelve Monkeys tries to be both and ends up being neither. You are led into believing this is has a solid, well thought out plot and then suddenly something really stupid happens. Well that's fine for an 'art' film but this just isn't imaginative enough to be one of those.<br/><br/>I think probably Terry Gilliam is trying to be something he isn't. The Time Bandits and especially Brazil were brilliant films simply because they weren't trying to copy anything.

"TheConk","Null","0","1","16 June 2003"," Time Travel 101, for the confused (*miniscule spoilers*)
","IMHO, there are far too many posts here by people who don't understand the way time travel is treated in the movie, which is also the way it is understood by modern science and logical thought.  I will attempt to educate the uninformed and misled, because this is really a simple concept.<br/><br/>Time travel (this is all hypothetical, as time travel doesn't currently exist) does NOT create paradoxes.  What happens as time moves forward, happens, and cannot be changed.  If someone travels back in time, then their actions in the past they travel into had already happened.<br/><br/>Think about it like this:  everything that happened in, say, 2002, happened, and cannot be altered.  This is not to say that I can't travel back in time to 2002 and do whatever I want; merely that whatever I do as a time traveler in 2002 has already happened then.  The past is unchangeable, but that doesn't mean no one from the future had a hand in it.  This was repeatedly referred to in the movie:  Bruce Willis's character kept saying that he couldn't stop the spread of the virus because it had already happened.<br/><br/>Likewise, you can't go back in time and kill yourself, because you are alive now.  If you had died in the past, you would be dead now.  And you can't stop 9/11, the Kennedy assassination, etc. because if you did, they wouldn't have occurred.  You can try, but you will fail, as attested to by the fact that these events have happened.<br/><br/>So forget the Back to the Future movies; entertaining but completely contrary to the modern--and much more sensible--view of time travel.<br/><br/>And as a final example:  in the world of the movie, Bruce Willis was at the front lines of World War I in 1917.  That happened, and there was never a 1917 when he WASN'T there.  He didn't go there until whenever in the future, but the picture of him there had existed since 1917.  No paradox, he was just a part of 1917 for a brief while.<br/><br/>I hope this will clear up all questions regarding paradoxes and such; there were no time travel paradoxes in the movie.  But I still don't understand the whole Madeleine Stowe ""I feel like I've always known you"" thing; it's not because she sees him as a little boy in the airport (that puts her in HIS mind, not vice versa) but I don't know what DOES cause it.  Maybe a second viewing will clear it up, we'll see.<br/><br/>What a great movie, btw!<br/><br/>--AC"

A virus has decimated virtually all of the Earth's human population, leaving us living in terrible squalor deep below the ground. One day\night, Cole is ""volunteered"" for an experiment, which involves him being sent back in time, to find information about where the plague came from. Sadly, the scientists send him back too far, and that's where things begin spiraling out of control... This is a poetic, sometimes ironically funny film that, despite the bleak subject matter, emerges as something highly enjoyable. Brad Pitt is an over the top delight as a man who may or may not be responsible for the desolate future, whilst Madeline Stowe and Willis both deliver delightfully subtle performances. It looks great as well, veering between Gothic nightmare and crowded city streets. The music is great, veering as wildly as the plot itself. However, i don't like this as much as ""Brazil"", for one reason:It's not original enough. We've seen the time travel, horrible future scenario before, it doesn't impact like it should. But that's a minor quibble. As a whole, this is one of the most accomplished, scary and dark films i have yet to see. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for reading."

","12 Monkeys is wonderfully acted,has fabulous sets,which show off the Philadelphia skyline,City Hall, and the interior of Wanamaker's store.Brad Pitt,cast against type, puts in a magnificent performance as the sociopathic nutcase,Jeffrey Goines and should have bagged that Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Madeleine Stowe, as the Psychiatrist, Railly is superb and Bruce Willis, in one of his better roles, is convincing as our main character Cole. But to me the screenplay and editing are key here propelling Gilliam's vision.If you want to see genius, look no further.If you haven't seen it,rent it, if just for Pitt's hilarious over the top performance. For those of you who have seen it and are intrigued by the conundrums inherent within the film, read on... 12 Monkeys is a 'tabula Rasa',a blank slate, a Rorschach test all rolled into one.Some elements seem to be incongruous, inconsistent,don't quite fit.Well it's meant to be that way so we, the audience, can interact in Gilliam's Magnum Opus. You will find things in this movie if you look closely and follow the dialogue.It requires multiple viewings to build up the clues along the way.It's like an iceberg,10% on the surface and the bulk of its meaning below the waterline. This may be result in Gilliam's and/or your own subjective impressions. SYNCHRONICITY/DEJA VU MOMENTS: Willis's character Cole,comes before a board of psychiatrists who are assessing his mental state to see if he's psychotic. In 1951,Carl Jung, a Swiss psychoanalyst,contemporary of Freud, published a small paper on coincidences he had encountered with his clients at his clinical practice. He coined the term, Synchronicity,meaningful coincidences that occur when we think of something or notice an element and it manifests itself in the real world. As an example, you think of a forgotten person,the phone rings, and hey presto, its them on the line.12 Monkeys is riddled with such synchronistic moments and motifs. The most glaring one is the motif of monKEY. When Jeffery Goines says he can get Cole out of the institution ,we see the communal TV set showing an advertisement for The Florida KEYs,then the program returns to  Marx's Brothers film 'MonKEY Business',Jeffrey acts like a mischievous monKEY fooling around with the other patients and now produces a KEY saying 'I did my part',suddenly he causes disruption and Cole tries to escape.On the way out he gets advice to visit the Florida KEYs.later on in the movie,we have Dr Railly {Madeleine Stowe) tell Cole 'We're booked for KEY west (part of Florida KEYs).Get it,fantastic!!<br/><br/>Cole is trying to find the KEY that will unlock for him where and when his reality is. 'I HAVE TO GO INTO THE PAST ONCE MORE'/PORTALS OF THE PAST (VERTIGO/HITCHCOCK): Railly and Cole at one point flee from the law into a 24 hour movie theatre showing Hitchcock movies.On the screen is a scene from VERTIGO 1958,Hitchcock's bizarre masterpiece.We see Jimmy Stewert take Kim Novak to a cross sectional cutting from a Sequioa tree.She points to a spot on the bark""When I was born"" then another ""When I die"".Tree ring dating. You start at the center work your way out, move forward, so to speak,in time, along a radius line to a particular time and date.You can also move in reverse,back along the radius line and cut another radius opposite to the SAME TIME AND DATE. This inserted movie within 12 Monkeys is KEY.The inference strongly suggests circular time.COLE'S WORLD IS CIRCULAR TIME, that keeps repeating itself over and over.Railly is part of the fabric of his time.Stewert turns to Novak in VERTIGO and asks her""Have you been here before?""Cole tells Railly ""I've seen this film before...when I was a child.. the film remains the same...but you change every time you see it.."" Intrigued with this idea,I reviewed a tape of VERTIGO. Lo and behold,Novak's character is called 'MADELINE'. But THIS Madeline was somebody else BEFORE she dyed her hair blond.Railly dyes her hair blond and Cole says he recognises her as in his dreams,then Railly says something mindblowing""I REMEMBER YOU LIKE THIS"".back to VERTIGO,folks. Stewert relives his past in order to find his Madeline. Vertigo says that Stewert, as a retired detective,is enlisted by an old friend to OBSERVE his wife as his friend believes that his wife is living a past life.""If I could just find the KEY IN THE BEGINNING and put it together"" Stewert tells Novak.There we have it Vertigo's solutions apply to 12 Monkeys.Genius!!! Cole is repeating events over and over but remembering only deja vu moments and synchronicity, that will not lead him to form a whole.Hence he does not know a particular character in his dream. IMMORTALITY/REINCARNATION: VERTIGO'S Kim Novak is under the false psychiotic illusion that she is reincarnated.Cole at the end of 12 Monkeys, becomes immortal to repeat his life over and over.Question is whose's controlling this and more importantly why? 'WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN' /VERTIGO: The so called scientists of 2035 look like a sinister bunch but behave like 'clowns' wrongly sending Cole back through time.They seem to be making mistakes,but they're not. In order to have Railly believe Cole they have to send him back to 1916 so Railly can believe the physical evidence (Cole's antique bullet).In VERTIGO Novak writes a confessional letter to Stewert explaining that he was a victim of an<br/><br/>elaborate plan to conceal the truth from him.The scientists in 12 Monkeys appear not to know what happens to Cole and rely on his OBSERVATIONS.However Cole's friend Hose recognises Cole at the airport FROM BEHIND AND DISGUISED BY RAILLY. In Vertigo Novak at one point asks Stewert 'Why are you doing this?',the exact same question Cole asks Railly in the movie theatre.Asking why must Hose give Cole a gun? Well,if only because the scientists are tracking him and his moves and know he left a gun behind at Goines estate carpark.So the scientists are manipulating things ,but how far.Why then do we hear someone say ""I'm Jones..in insurance"".Work it out. This is why I love movies like this,they're intelligent.Gilliam is taking over where Hitchcock left off. I give this movie 20 out of 10.Remarkable work."

","Pros: Directing, sets, cinematography.<br/><br/>Cons: Muddled, very confusing, feels too close to Brazil.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam's new film is about a virus which will wipe out the people on earth and a man sent from the future to save us all. This reads like Terminator 2: Judgement day but this movie is far from it. First of all, Bruce Willis is human, and second of all, when he time-travels, things don't go smootly as the terminator. Willis keeps us guessing whether his character is really from the future or one of those people you meet at the streets proclaiming the end of the world. Brad pitt plays a animal right activists whose character is basically limited to incoherent babbling and Madeline Stowe plays a psychaitrist who is a kindred spirit to Sam Lowry. Gilliam uses bookend technique to begin and end the film and this provides for two very ingenious twists. Much better than the fisher king and Baron Munchausen, Gilliam would later fall from grace with Fear and Loathing but that's another review.<br/><br/>Premise: Willis is sent to save the world from a deadly virus.<br/><br/>Twelve monkeys was nominated for two Academy awards.<br/><br/>Grade: 8/10 (Gilliam is back on track)."

","There have been many reviews expressing a confused plot and characters. I agree to this when I first saw this movie some years ago. But recently when I read the script of the movie, I realized that the script was meticulously written and events are inter-related. Actually for the story of 12 monkeys, it's better ""to read"" then ""to watch"" as you can have time to digest the ""present"", ""past"" and ""future"" as well as flipping over what the characters have said.<br/><br/>As mentioned in IMDB, this film has many hidden hints to hitchcock movies. I would regard the title as a macguffin as the 12 monkeys is not actually related to the fate of mankind, but it remains a key element to link up the past and present, and to the characters in the movie, a hidden thing that they were chasing after. This resembles the uranium bottles in ""notorious""."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Nowadays it is hard to find original and thought-provoking scripts . Therefore I will give my deepest congratulations to the Peoples family for their tight and sophisticated play (I will have to note that I have downloaded the screenplay from the internet and Terry Gilliam has followed the script with religious devoutness , scene by scene and sentence to sentence : he omitted or changed 5 - 6 lines tops ) . I know that the idea was inspired by a French short film but this adaptation is very successful . It was a matter of execution both from the writers and the director . Many viewers have commented on the various issues the film deals with . They have labeled it as ""sci fi"" , ""time travel"" , ""prophecy about the biological weapons and the nuclear destruction "" etc , etc . I admit that all these subjects are resident in the film but the spinal column is nothing more than a poetic tale of paranoid doubt and vague , blurr memories . It is a search deep down in the abyss of a man 's brain . James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a convict from the future who is sent back in time in 1996 to collect information for a deadly virus which will extinguish 99 % of the human population . He meets a psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) who wants to help him despite James is a violent and potentially dangerous man (just like a savage beast). He also meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) , a slightly deranged young man whose father is a famous scientist who does research on viruses and is highly likely linked to the total destruction of man kind . This is the basic plot . The scenes in the mental asylum are quite surrealistic and give the stigma of the film . Twelve Monkeys is not your typical sci - fi with laser weapons , aliens , explosions , building collapses etc . Most of the movie is the roaming of James and Kathryn with the car which gives us a sense of a road movie . The fact that you don 't get bored with this non - adrenalin proves the success of the script and the great interest of the characters and the basic premise (despite the orders from the PTBT<br/><br/>and the repeated statements from Cole himself , his mission is essentially the salvation of the world although he doesn't admit it ) .<br/><br/>
Twelve Monkeys is without doubt a confusing movie with a complex plot . There are questions which are answered by the end and questions that remain unsolved ,like it is never explained what is the husky old voice James hears throughout the film . One of the best lines which summarizes the madness of the whole film is "" Maybe I am in the next cell . Maybe they (the 5 scientists)put me to spy on you . Or MAYBE I am only inside your mind "" . As you realize the awkward and perplexed script is kind of hard to follow . Therefore the ultra-predictable finale (even a 3 year old can figure out the ending 50 minutes into the film) was an obligatory compromise of the writers in order to make the film digestible . James 's dreams are obviously foreseeing and knowing the prophecy you sit back and you are waiting for it to be fulfilled . That is not the end of the suspense though.*********SPOILER ALERT****t 2/3 into the movie a very interesting question rises : is this mission true or James is simply an insane person who lives in a fantastic illusional world ? This I believe is the greatest virtue of Twelve Monkeys and that is why I like it so much . The doubt factor is not inherent from the beginning of the film (like in ""Almost Dead"" with Shannen Doherty or ""The Dead Can't Lie"" with Tommy Lee Jones"") but emerges after the middle and not at all in a gimmicky mode which would have left the viewer feeling cheated . The handling of James' questionable sanity from him and Kathryn and the schizophrenic situation of not knowing what is reality and myth is perfectly executed. I don 't know if it was inspired from Vertigo or other films of the maitre but if it was a rehash it was a good one . Fortunately just before the end the ""historic truth"" is restored with tangible evidence that all these really happened ********END SPOILER******** I will urge you to see the film twice . I did it , and it was a wonderful experience . There is too much information for the brain to retain with just one viewing . There are plot elements which play a crucial part for the comprehension of the events and the fight against the tricks of the mind . For example I hadn 't realized the vitally important vocal messages from the future (watch carefully) .<br/><br/>I will close the review with comments on the crew members . As you already observed I regard Twelve Monkeys as a script movie and not a director 's . Unfortunately the brilliantly talented Gilliam of ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" or even the campy ""Time Bandits"" backsteps to a coldly professional subtle work . I believe he could have done more . The same goes for the music and the rather lame cinematography . Ok I admit that this nebulous photography works fine in the future scenes or in the foggy streets where the twelve monkeys headquarters are , but other than that it gets annoying . As for the cast Brad Pitt 's overrated performance is enjoyable (but not great) , Bruce Willis does a very good job as the mysterious convict and the most underrated performance is definitely Madeline Stowe 's . She is the only ""logic"" axis of the narration . Stowe gives a great appearance throughout the entire spectrum of her character 's aspects . The professional inquisitive psychiatrist , the frightened kidnap victim , the compassionate doctor who wants to help a ""lost soul"" who is suffering from hallucinations , the detective / resolver of this frighteningly paranoid situation and finally the protector of the haunted man . Stowe is subtle , grounded and effectively realistic in her performance .<br/><br/>All in all , if you want a different kind of entertainment check this out . However if you hate messy mystic films which look like a giant puzzle like ""Dune"" then you should clearly stay out . Gilliam 's film is a different original unusual experience .<br/><br/>A surrealistic masterpiece         TWELVE MONKEYS    8.5 / 10"

But films can be blown by one small, seemingly insignificant detail that punches a hole in the plot and deflates the entire movie. This is my beef:<br/><br/>At the end, near the airport, Bruce (what you talkin' bout) Willis is given a gun to kill boomer from 'saint elsewhere'. Apparently they want him dead before he releases the virus on the world. (And don't say they didn't give Willis the gun to kill him. What was he going to do, request a sample of the virus at gunpoint, then tell Boomer to 'go about your business'? No.)<br/><br/>Die Hard man dies in his failed attempt. The virus is released. Lo and behold, The insurance lady comes by just in time to save the day. After the virus is released. I guess to get the original virus so they can develop an antidote in the future. Maybe to stop the further spread before Boomer gets off the plane in another country.<br/><br/>So, dear readers, why are they bothering to give (what you talkin' bout) willis a gun to stop boomer at the last possible second? They can go to any time they want. They've done it before. Why not just kill boomer at any time before he takes the virus and be done with it? Run him over with a car on his 18th birthday? Accidental drug overdose while in college? Hey, you've got 40 years to work with, be creative!<br/><br/>Think about it. Would you, wanting to stop a deadly virus from wiping out humanity, place all your bets on a 15 minute window of opportunity while Boomer is in the airport, or any of the 40 years of his life leading up to that point? Did they think viewers wouldn't be able to comprehend one more jump back to a different time, or did they just want to maintain the 'dark' part of their film, at the expense of the logic they themselves have set up?<br/><br/>I've seen comments from fans of this movie that attack anyone who doesn't like it. I wanted to like it, that's why I bought a ticket. The problem is if you get your viewers to suspend disbelief for your movie, you need to give them a set of rules to believe in for the duration of your movie. You can't then suspend the rules you've set up and expect your movie not to have a fatal flaw, and this movie has a big one."

","12 Monkeys is not only the best film of 1995 but also one of the best of the 90's.  Bruce Willis gives his second best performance in his career,only being out-done by his 6th sense work.  Great, thought-provoking work by the entire cast.  Should have won Best Picture for its originality and Best Actor for Willis.  Oscar nods should have been given to Pitt and Stowe for their great work also.<br/><br/>4/4 on the Jim Rocco scale (In my top 10 of all time)"
