","It's definitely no LOTR...But it's still a pretty cool movie. Sure, it took it's time to try to tell the story and dragged on for a little too long, but other than that, the special effects were great, and it was entertaining as hell. It's a good introduction to The Hobbit franchise."
"bob the moo","Null","222","305","26 January 2013"," A visual feast but yet I wasn't gripped by the story or characters as much as I should have been
","When I heard that there was to be a film version of The Hobbit, I was quite looking forward to it as the big finish of Lord of the Rings was still in my mind and, unlike LotR, I had actually read The Hobbit several times many years ago. When I heard that it might be two films I wasn't surprised but the news that it was to be three did rather dampen my spirits as I don't know if I had the interest for this story to be concluded as 2016 rolls into town. Regardless I did of course watch the film because it is still a large blockbuster and, at a time of the year normally filled with overly earnest Oscar contenders, I did quite like the idea of returning to this world again.<br/><br/>With this in mind I did wonder why I watched it with a surprisingly detached air and why I wasn't able to get into it like I should have done. I had some reservations with the first film in the LotR trilogy but this seemed different because it certainly wasn't a lack of action and forward motion that gave me a problem here. Quite the opposite actually because, once the first 45 minutes or so are out of the way then the action set-pieces come thick and fast and noisy. The opening hints at the power of the dragon to come before settling down for a gentle reintroduction to the Shire and then the characters we will follow; this section I found a little longer than it should have been and I could have done with a bit less noisy banter from the Dwarfs, since the film would provide much more from them. The majority of the film is the journey (or at least that bit of it that this film covers) and it produces plenty of action with great special effects really well integrated into the live action. So visually and technically there is plenty here. Problem is that little of it felt urgent or tense and actually the delivery of the constant action does rather detract from it.<br/><br/>With Fellowship of the Ring, the group was smaller and the development of the plot better; additionally the action was more scaled down and comparatively simple. Here we have set-pieces where it feels like everything has been thrown at the screen and every inch of every frame has been filled with movement wherever possible. This tended to overwhelm me rather than draw me in though and in effect the noise prevented me really getting into it. Likewise by the time I had seen the characters survive impossible situations and defy gravity for the third or fourth time, the film sort of lost the ability to make me believe there was danger involved – which is a problem given I was already being pushed away by how busy and noisy it all was. Tellingly the scene that worked the best for me was with Gollum; this scene had tension, had uncertainity, had threat and did it all with small movements and dialogue; also worth noting that while Gollum is of course another special effect, you don't notice it in that scene because you are focused on the content instead of the visual.<br/><br/>The cast sort of fit into this approach as well. While everyone is fine and does as required, at times they do tend to become part of the noise and effects rather than being characters. Freeman is a good Bilbo and his mannerisms work well (which helps negate his limited range) while of course McKellen is always welcome. The dwarfs didn't make much of an impression on me though, even if they all looked the part and delivered a few laughs. The rest of the cast are all fine but to be honest the effects are the main stars here and technically it is very impressive even if it is a bit overdone at times.<br/><br/>I didn't dislike The Hobbit but at the same time I was disappointed in it. The action is noisy and busy but there isn't enough to draw me into the story or to make the action thrill me so much as it did overwhelm me. Hopefully the second film will see the characters and plots grow me on so that I am more emotionally bought into the films, but for this first one I must confess to being surprised by how much the film seemed content to have me watch from a distance rather than draw me in and engage me."
"gorbadoc25","6","629","923","13 December 2012"," An Unexpected Disappointment
","I was convinced the (many) criticisms I read beforehand were exaggerated and wouldn't bother me. To my surprise, quite some criticisms seemed justified in the end ...<br/><br/>***THE SCRIPT***<br/><br/>ADDITIONS: On paper, the additions looked like a great way to create added value. However, while I understand why they included them, they all feel out of place.<br/><br/><ul><li>Opening scene: Ian Holm just looks too dissimilar from his appearance in FOTR (especially his haircut), which is really distracting. The frame story doesn't blend in naturally and the history of Erebor has too much to show in too little time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Radagast: He appears as suddenly as he disappears. His scene in Dol Guldur really threw me out of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The White Council: I know the screenwriters want to underline the growing dark powers (hence the - preposterous - finding of the Morgul blade), but the empty talk about things of which we all know how they've played out in the LOTR films isn't convincing at all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Azog: An appallingly one-dimensional character, who feels most out of place (the fact that he looks like a creature from a cheap horror movie also doesn't help ...). His scenes have a strange ""un-Tolkien"" vibe, particularly the battle of Azanulbizar (the worst scene of the movie), which doesn't feel like a fierce and thrilling battle at all.</li></ul><br/><br/>FROM THE BOOK: The episodic structure prevents the film from having a fluid narrative and squeezes the tension out of every new dangerous situation: the events just leave you cold.<br/><br/>In the book, we experience everything through Bilbo's eyes, which creates a strong connection between the reader and the main part. This is missing from the movie: Bilbo even seemed to have more or less disappeared between the troll encounter and the stone giants' battle. His homesickness, his doubts, all of this isn't really developed in the script.<br/><br/>The emphasis on Thorin is a good thing, but also not perfect: during the enclosure by the Wargs, I didn't buy Thorin's charge towards Azog and especially Bilbo's sudden ""action hero saves the day in the nick of time"" intervention. The latter seemed like a very inappropriate way to illustrate Bilbo's courage.<br/><br/>There were actually only two great scenes: Riddles in the Dark is amazing, but ironically, it also painfully shows how mediocre the rest of the movie actually is, because this is the only moment that comes close to the level of LOTR. Also, Bilbo's speech after they've escaped Goblin Town is a very welcome, for rare touching moment.<br/><br/>***THE PACING***<br/><br/>It's quite astonishing some people complain about the pacing, because the film was over before I knew it. In fact, I think the pacing is about just right and proved it would have been really difficult to adapt the book in just one fully-fledged movie. But since I didn't like the additions, I'm doubting whether a third film is necessary after all (but I suspend my judgment until 2014).<br/><br/>***THE CINEMATOGRAPHY***<br/><br/>One of the biggest (unpleasant) surprises is the cinematographic style. I'm not talking about the bright colors or the digital images, but the (lack of physical) camera use. Whereas LOTR has stunning ""real"" camera movements and an extremely accomplished ""handicraft"" feel, AUJ often feels like a video game. The camera is flying and whirling so limitlessly that it just doesn't feel like an authentic movie anymore. This is particularly apparent during the Orc chase and above all the absurd Goblin Town escape. The CGI is perfect, but too much is just too much.<br/><br/>***THE MUSIC***<br/><br/>After my long list of complaints, I'm truly relieved to say there is at least one thing that unconditionally gets my support, which is the score. The people who unfairly label Howard Shore's work as a ""re-hash of LOTR"" obviously didn't pay full attention, because when you listen to the score multiple times (and I admit it also took me several spins to really appreciate it), you discover a new rich and diverse musical tapestry once again masterfully woven by Shore. OF COURSE you hear the same themes when EXACTLY THE SAME places are visited as in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" ... If someone deserves credit for ""The Hobbit"", it's Shore: his music is in my view the only aspect of the movie on par with the level of LOTR.<br/><br/>***3D & 48 FPS***<br/><br/><ul><li>The 3D was good, no complaints about that. However, although I have no problems with watching movies in 3D, I start questioning its necessity.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I am bewildered many people claim that 48 fps creates a ""TV-look"" with ""actors with clear make-up on a fake set"". I didn't have that feeling at all, but on the other hand - and this was the most surprising - the difference with 24 fps isn't THAT spectacular. After 30 minutes, I even had to remind myself: ""Oh, I'm watching 48 fps, right?"". Yes, the images look very clear and it does smooth fast movements, but the latter (which is positive) only sticks out a couple of times (and no, the motion never comes across as ""sped up"", so I was never distracted by the higher frame rate). All in all, I consider 48 fps to be an improvement over 24 fps (without diminishing the ""cinematic"" look of a film), but I didn't have the feeling I had witnessed a ""revolutionary new cinema experience"".</li></ul><br/><br/>***** CONCLUSION *****<br/><br/>I didn't expect (or want) a replica of LOTR, but while ""The Hobbit"" isn't a bad movie, it isn't good either. I'm still perplexed I don't feel any urge to go see it again, unlike the LOTR films. We can only hope that Jackson recovers in time to save the next two films from unnecessary additions, lack of focus on Bilbo and a video game feeling. Well, at least we have new brilliant music to listen to!"
"dlpburke","1","1115","1732","16 December 2012"," Yeahhhh! Graphics! Action scenes! AWESOOOME!
","Let's kick off with the score I've given it. 5/10. That's for the reasonable job with the comedy, design, and things not related to story and pacing (with the exception of Gollum and the cave scene). I am tired of saying ""The graphics are great, but..."" I have rated it 1 here to reduce the average in order to reflect reality and not the fanboy love-in.<br/><br/>I am not going to sugar-coat this film or give it a good review just because people tell me I should. I am sick to death of sheep. I don't care if this is Tolkien or Jackson or how much money it took to make the film. If it's bad, it's bad.<br/><br/>Graphics count for nothing. The reason I watch a film is primarily for a great story and well written characters (I have to CARE about what is going on). I don't get dazzled by graphics anymore (if I ever did at all), and 3D action films do not make a film good. So right there is the problem with The Hobbit. The story is shallow and pretentious and cardboard. Let's run through why the film had me rolling my eyes throughout:<br/><br/><ul><li>The introduction is way too long.</li></ul><br/><br/>-The pacing is dire (and scenes that weren't in the book have been added).<br/><br/>-One brainless action scene after another for no other reason than to eat screen time (because the book is 300 pages and they are trying to maximise profits by having 3 films at 3 hours each). Watching 2 rock monsters fight for minutes is not captivating or cool, it's boring.<br/><br/>-Implausibility factor 10. I understand this is a fantasy. I understand that if everything was ultra realistic it would end up boring, but for heaven sake, that does not mean you can get away with what happens in this film. EVERY single scene shows something that would ordinarily kill someone. Fall down multiple ravines, battle 100's goblins with just a few men, rocks the size of cars flying at you... and no scratches, no deaths. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>-Lazy writing. You know you are witnessing a lazy-ass story when your heroes are saved at the last minute EVERY time in multiple scenes. Where does that leave us? It leaves us with all main characters intact and no dramatic tension. Every scene you see a massive rock crush a character you know they aren't dead. Every time you see them perilously close to the edge of a cliff, you know that even if they fall, they will be saved and/or survive. Further to this point, smaller problems exist such as Bilbo never handling a sword to suddenly taking on killer beasts like he has been to He-Man training school.<br/><br/>-Cliché crap. The way Bilbo goes from being an outcast to being accepted is contrived and rushed and totally obvious. It just smacks of lazy cliché writing. The acting that goes with it is not good either. Kind of like ""I once said... you weren't one of us... OH how wrong I was!"" *Roll eyes time*. Then you have the White Orc that Thorin said he had slain, and you just KNEW it was coming back at the end for some sort of showdown, didn't you? Talk about obvious. I blame the film for this because the scenes involved in the exposition were way too see-through... might as well have had Thorin wink at the camera! That brings me onto the whole ""Thorin dislikes Elves"" angle, where you know the Elves are suddenly going to become important allies just so we can have a totally obvious and expected reversal. Wow, Thorin, you got Bilbo wrong and you got the Elves wrong too! DRAMA.<br/><br/>-Lack of character development (Think Final Fantasy XII if you are a gamer). This was the stake through the heart of this film... Most of the dwarfs are completely redundant and I could not identify or even accept Bilbo. This was due partly to the lack of character development, partly to the script and partly to the actor. Same goes for Thorin except the scenes he is in feel more like a bad soap opera than they do a ""blockbuster"" film.<br/><br/>It is just dull and lifeless and stupid. You shouldn't do things just because you can. The LOTR trilogy for the most part had decent pacing, and it didn't do things too fast, too soon, or for the sake of it. The original trilogy suffers from some the complaints above AT TIMES, but nothing like The Hobbit does... The Hobbit is in a league of its own. I went to watch an engaging movie and I got a cartoon.<br/><br/>The use of CGI is also glaringly obvious and fake; like with the prequels of Star Wars, when the movie cuts between humans and CGI blobs, your brain is onto it. Stop relying on CGI for everything. It's getting annoying, not to mention OLD. At least Jackson makes real sets so it isn't a total wash out.<br/><br/>There is some real potential in this film and it is squandered; whether that's because Tolkien wrote a flawed book, whether it is because he wrote a book that doesn't take well to a feature length movie or whether it is because Jackson messed it up, that's what we ended up with.<br/><br/>The Hobbit should have been 2 films, and making it 3 has been the final nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>So, I am sat here mightily annoyed that once again graphics and self indulgent, completely pointless action scenes have trumped good storytelling and pacing.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is still entertaining at times and the 3D visuals are fun, but for me it is a massive disappointment.<br/><br/>Visuals can not MAKE a film, but when used like in The Hobbit, they sure as hell can break it."
"renoriders","2","348","535","19 December 2012"," I'm trying to keep an open mind here, but I just cant!
","I was about 8 years old when I was first introduced to the Hobbit from the animated 1 hour movie. The movie was a yearly event. As a child, it freaked me out. But, my Dad loved Glenn Yarbrough and the music, so, I was made to sit through it.<br/><br/>Since that time, I eventually appreciated the storyline of that silly cartoon and the characters from it. And, when I grew up, I read the book, and then the LOTR series and fell in love with them.<br/><br/>I think that you have to look at this movie from 2 points of view. From 1. Viewers like myself who fell in love with the books and original characters and are looking for some semblance of that universe in a movie. 2. Viewers, like my kids, who have never read the books and are fascinated by animated computer novels, games, and the unrealistic expectations of immortality in virtual super humans.<br/><br/>If you are type 1. You will hate this movie. It fell short of all of my expectations. The Hobbit is not an epic story. In other words, this story was short, a 300 page book. It was, however, an epic adventure seen through the eyes of a single character, a character who had a realistic perspective of his small contribution to the world around him. His character never wavered from that perspective as he watched events unfold and did what little he could to contribute and help. He never became the grandiose, cocky, tempered tough guy that this movie seems to try to portray him as.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" was a story that sets up the universe that these characters lived in. Elves, Goblins, Orcs, Hobbits and Humans and other creatures defined their roles in this world and their conflicts. Then, the story moves on to show how a band of characters, plus the Hobbit, interacts in this world and the story unfolds giving a lesson and a way to perceive our own world and how we, as individuals, interact with it. It's a simple message, yet, the book finds a way to make this message profound giving the characters depth and meaning and focusing on the hobbit as one individual, insignificant in his eyes, in an amazing world. This most basic message which encompasses the entirety of the book is completely, 100% lost in the movie. The one line in the movie, by Gandalf, which was never spoken in the book, but, was the most significant and meaningful in this movie was, ""All good stories need to be embellished a little..."" That was an understatement.<br/><br/>If you are type 2, you might enjoy this movie. Tons of action, crazy cgi, most of the film is animated, and it attempts to tie into and be a prequel for the LOTR trilogy. Lot's of battles and fighting, immortal death defying falls (just like any computer game) that serves no purpose to define our mortality (since no one dies or even gets injured), last second cliff hanger rescues, gross ugly characters that sound goofy and look like Jar Jar Binks on steroids, pretty scenery, loud noises, explosions, more bad guys killed per second that you can shake a stick at and pretty much any other Hollywood formula that draws in money. And, that was just one movie in a trilogy that has no purpose other than to make lots and lots of money.<br/><br/>I took the Kids to watch this and spared no expense. IMax screen, popcorn, Icees, candy and some snacks. $100 down the toilet. The kids fell asleep during the first hour and I wanted to leave after the 2nd."
"SongOfFall","1","298","465","25 December 2012"," Soulless commercial ride on the Hollywood roller-coaster
","THE QUALITY OF THE FILM Imagine ""Spy Kids"" with elements of Tolkien's writing. Technological demonstration, a large budget at the hands of a tasteless creative group. The CG animation of trolls was almost as ugly as in the Lord of the Rings. The only reason of making it 3D was making me cope with the uncomfortably of 3D. The dwarf parcour and scenes copied from the Lord of the Rings (compare the fight of Thorin and Azog with that of Isildur and Sauron), artificially added action-scenes and castrated non-action scenes spoke of lazy, commercial, mainstream work. Radagast's animal companions were Walt Disney's ""Snow-white"" bad.<br/><br/>THE PLOT The poor novella (yep, Lord of the Rings is a novel trilogy, The Hobbit - only a small novella, yet both amount a trilogy of films) was so stretched out that the original and added material could be equal to each other. And whatever was taken from the book, was mutilated for reasons unknown: in the book, Azog is a goblin, not an orc, and is killed by Dain, not Thorin, and his son Bolg replaced him in Moria. The ""stone giants"" are only a dwarf legend about thunder. Radagast isn't a main character in any Tolkien work I know, because he doesn't give a damn about the wars of humans, elves and the rest. The Dol Guldur conflict and the ousting of the Necromancer actually has nothing to do with ""The Hobbit"". There is no toilet humor in the scene with trolls - in the book, Gandalf gives the trolls advice in troll voice, makes them change their mind so many times that dawn comes. In the movie - a troll blows his nose on Bilbo, then Bilbo starts a lecture on tapeworms. An awful lot of cliché (""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"", ""I'm sure we're through the worst"" *Dumb Dumb Dumb* DRAGON'S WOKEN UP!!!). It was made so it would please a diaper-wearing kid, but don't make them sad. I hate the tragic scene->happy end formula, which was abused, raped, killed, buried, taken out of the grave, raped again in this film.<br/><br/>THE HEROES The heroes were lacking any defining traits so intense in the book. Only a Hollywood template - smart-mouthed guys with tactless jokes. They were given one-liners/catchphrases to define them instead. It wasn't always easy to see the difference between certain dwarfs and the Great Goblin. In the book dwarfs are polite, but dry and greedy. In the book - kind-hearted heroic men, a bit stubborn, and loving to troll people now and then. Bilbo's not a conservative gentleman hobbit, who gets carried away by his curiosity for adventure, but a timid teenager. Gandalf isn't a powerful mage, but a well-informed homeless guy, Radagast is another one, and a schizophrenic in addition. Might as well fit in in Terry Gilliam's ""The Fisher King"" (awesome movie btw). Actually, there was no Bilbo character at all: there was a combined character of Frodo, Sam, Mery, Pin from LOTR.<br/><br/>Verdict - if you want Tolkien, read the book. The movie isn't worth watching even once."
"markdroulston","4","450","713","13 December 2012"," An unexpected disappointment
","""All great stories deserve a little embellishment."" So says Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) in the most telling line in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson's return to the world of JRR Tolkien. It's a line that clearly outlines Jackson and his co-writers' intentions, yet it comes off as a veiled apology, as if the film-making team knew that what they have created is going to be problematic for die-hard Middle Earth fans. Sadly, Jackson's new film doesn't come close to silencing the skeptics like his Lord of the Rings films did, and is actually more ill-conceived than expected.<br/><br/>Things that do work well for the most part in The Hobbit are sequences that come directly from the source novel. Iconic scenes, such as the arrival of the dwarfs at Bag End or the encounter with the trolls are handled pretty well, despite being padded out to unnecessary lengths with lame gags and pointless alteration of the original events in the book. Juggling such a massive primary cast is obviously a challenge, and as such the film's best moments involve only one or two characters, with Bilbo's (Martin Freeman) meeting of Gollum (Andy Serkis) and the finding of the ring being a particular stand-out sequence, the only one that seemed like it could have used more time.<br/><br/>However, all of the good work that Jackson & Co do with the direct source material is swamped by the content they felt they had to develop themselves. The great achievement of the LOTR films is how they managed to distill the huge source novels to their most important story beats, only hinting at most of the wider story in a way that brought incredible richness to the world in which they take place. With The Hobbit though, Jackson only has a 300 page novel to start with, and the decision to make three lengthy films, I assume to parallel the first trilogy, is precisely why this first film doesn't work.<br/><br/>The Hobbit should be allowed to stand alone as its own film, but it is structured in such a way, almost identically to the first LOTR entry The Fellowship of the Ring, that it's all but impossible not to compare them. As a side-effect, the much lighter tone will be jarring for a lot of established franchise fans, the very people the film seems to be primarily aimed at. The chase sequence in the goblin tunnels for example is little more than an updated version of the Moria scenes from LOTR. It's exciting enough, but much of the action feels in service of the film- making technology on display rather than the story, and as such none of the stakes of the earlier films are built here.<br/><br/>Where the LOTR films had to keep moving at such a pace to fit everything in, The Hobbit dwells on unnecessary moments which had only the briefest of mentions in the novel to reach its 2 hour 49 minute runtime. Most damaging are the call backs linking the previous trilogy, setting up what is likely to be an almost completely new story bridge between the two trilogies in the third film due in 2014. There is absolutely no reason for Frodo (Elijah Wood), Saruman (Christopher Lee), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) to appear in this story, yet here they are, taking us away from a perfectly good narrative about a quest to fight a dragon. It reeks of cynical franchise care, and arguably disrespectful to the carefully crafted world that Tolkien created.<br/><br/>There's a good movie somewhere in The Hobbit, and had Jackson shown more restraint we might have seen it. The film could easily lose at least 45 minutes, but it feels as if director feels so beholden to his previous work that he needs to deliver an epic on the scale of LOTR. But that's not what this book is, and we're left with an uneasy balance - the lighter tone to distinguish this as a separate story but a strict adherence to the LOTR structure - but ultimately doesn't fulfill either side.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"Hurleyfanboy","1","431","690","18 December 2012"," Critics are right fans wrong
","First came the original trilogy, a popular success and critically acclaimed. Then, some years later, a second trilogy began, a prequel to the original, and the first installment of this second trilogy turned out to be awful. We saw this pattern play out once, with ""Star Wars,"" and now, alas, it begins again, with ""The Hobbit,"" a movie that is exactly one Jar Jar Binks away from being as bad as ""The Phantom Menace."" The problem may be built into the design. The previous ""Lord of the Rings"" films were each based on a single book. ""The Hobbit"" - more like a children's novel than the other three, a kind of ""Tom Sawyer"" to their ""Huckleberry Finn"" - is just one book, smaller than any of the other J.R.R. Tolkien books, and yet it is being blown out into three enormous films. This first installment runs 169 minutes.<br/><br/>This puts a lot of pressure on a simple story, especially when you consider that director Peter Jackson and his screenwriters really can't take liberties with the tale, not without incurring the wrath of millions. They must work with what they have, and what they have is quite enough for one pleasing and inventive two-hour movie - or a nine-hour disaster stretched over three years.<br/><br/>This pressure, this obligation to stretch everything to the limits of endurance and beyond, is felt from the film's early minutes. Howard Shore's beautiful theme music, from the previous trilogy, filters in. We see the idyllic Middle-earth countryside and are introduced to Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins - Freeman was born to be a hobbit; he is ideal casting - and we settle in for a magical experience. And then, slowly, a fatal distance opens up between what we're hoping and what we're actually seeing.<br/><br/>Bilbo is a happy hobbit, a homebody who enjoys his creature comforts and doesn't have a violent impulse about him. Yet he is recruited by Gandalf the Grey Wizard (Ian McKellen) to join an expedition by dwarfs to retake their homeland from a dragon. See how quickly it takes to say that? Bilbo is recruited. Period. Yet the movie takes this tiny bit of crucial plot movement and dilutes its effectiveness: The dwarfs show up for an impromptu party at Bilbo's house. Bilbo frets about what the dwarfs will do to his house. Then the dwarfs clean up. Then Bilbo says he won't join their fight. But then he does. The film milks every detail of the text, every hint of vacillation in the main character, to turn water flowing downstream into molasses walking uphill.<br/><br/>It must be said that if you plan to enjoy ""The Hobbit,"" it really helps to love dwarfs. Others may prefer hobbits - they're adorably idiosyncratic, small, chubby, eat all day, have big ears, and they're incredibly sincere. Still others may prefer the Olympian elves - beautiful, pristine, sure and eternal. But there is only one hobbit in the entire movie, and only one brief sequence involving elves. Otherwise you're stuck with the dwarfs, who are like Vikings - boorish, slovenly, hearty and heavy-drinking - and not exactly lovable.<br/><br/>The three ""Lord of the Rings"" were heavy on battle scenes, but ""The Hobbit"" is almost nothing but battles. Without a stopwatch, it would be hard to know for sure, but probably 50 percent of screen time is taken up with fighting - perhaps up to 80 percent if you count planning for and recovering from battles. Some of these battles have pockets of interest: A conflict with goblins plays out like a trapeze act, in three dimensions, with the combatants falling through space, landing and regrouping. But most of ""The Hobbit"" is like looking over Peter Jackson's shoulder to watch a computer screen.<br/><br/>Occasionally, when the smoke clears, we get a glimpse of what ""The Hobbit"" might have been, had Freeman's quirkiness and humanity been given a chance to set the tone. The movie really springs to life only when Freeman dominates, as when Bilbo falls into a cave and discovers Gollum, looking like James Carville but acting like Peter Lorre. It's an encounter worthy of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy - so is the all-too-brief scene between Gandalf and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett).<br/><br/>If you loved the earlier films, these are moments you will hold on to, but they're very few, and they're not enough."
"Likes_Ninjas90","4","157","256","21 December 2012"," A deliberately inflated work of fanfare, with eyes drawn acutely towards the box office
","This is the first of three films Peter Jackson has made to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's prequel to Lord of the Rings. An elderly Bilbo Baggins writes to Frodo about the land of Erebor, where the Dwarf King Thror lost his land and prosperity to the dragon Smaug. Bilbo then recalls the earlier years of his life (played by Martin Freeman), where he's timid and lost his sense of adventure. Bilbo's complacency is questioned by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who secretly arranges for a meeting to be held in the hobbit's house. One evening Bilbo is interrupted by thirteen dwarfs who invite themselves inside. He's told these dwarfs are in search of a home but need a burglar who can accompany them to the mountain where Smaug is and take back their land and treasure. Initially reluctant, Bilbo trails after the unit but this does little to impress Thorin (Richard Armitage), the dwarf leader and grandson of Thror, who doubts the hobbit's commitment. <br/><br/>Even without reading the novel The Hobbit, nothing erases the feeling while watching An Unexpected Journey that this is a deliberately inflated work of fanfare, with eyes drawn acutely towards the box office. Good cinema is defined by economics and how efficiently a story can be told with images. Peter Jackson demonstrated this skill with his Rings trilogy, gracefully balancing multiple narrative threads and characters, and ensuring each one possessed an appropriate amount of emotional weight.<br/><br/>Why then has he chosen to make a soulless, linear action movie, extravagantly scaled, but so insubstantial that it never justifies itself as the start of a trilogy? Penned by no less than four writers, including Jackson, this would have been more satisfying as one film with richer themes and selective action. Instead, a novel of barely 300 pages long is extended to nearly three hours, if only to showcase boring battle scenes and superfluous new technology, falsely touted as innovative. <br/><br/>The excess of Jackson's passion stems from his fascination with geek culture. Since the inception of his career in the 1980s, making low budget horror films, he has been concerned with subjects like the undead and the uncanny. His recent films have been criticised for being overly dependent on special effects. The trajectory of his career, from horror to global blockbusters, is not unlike James Cameron, who is coincidentally using Jackson's special effects studio Weta Digital to work on Avatar 2. <br/><br/>Both men have become transfixed by spectacle, with each of their films more elaborate and technically sophisticated than the last. They seem intent on blurring the lines between video games and cinema, which means more investment into technology and effects, rather than the scripts. Someone distanced from the source material and video game culture might have made The Hobbit less self-indulgent and plodding. A legal battle between Jackson and New Line Cinema meant Guillermo Del Toro was originally meant to direct the film but was eventually replaced. <br/><br/>As it stands, Jackson's love for video games is all too visible here. The script is short on themes, characterisation and subplots. It's overly rigid structure means the film becomes too absorbed in its sets and its environments, instead of the story. Each scene is like a level from a game, designed to showcase a gallery of monsters, which are cogs in the film's tired formula for suspense. Exposition is followed by danger and then an escape route. Press start to begin. <br/><br/>If the desire for a home offers some resemblance of a motive, it's regularly lost in the flurry of the action, most of which is extremely unengaging and lacking in tension. The film's one good scene admittedly adds some suspense and intrigue. It involves the reappearance of the monster Gollum and begins tying threads back to the Rings trilogy. The detail in Gollum's expressions, beautifully captured again by Andy Serkis, is even more incredible than before.<br/><br/>How do scenes like this, as overlong as they are, fare through the introduction of 48 frames per second? The standard frame rate for films has been to use 24 frames per second. The additional number of frames on the screen adds more detail and colour to the images. The trade-off is that it gives the illusion the images are moving much faster, which is very distracting. It's an unnecessary addition so if you must see the film, watch it in 2D. <br/><br/>Will fans enjoy the movie? Undoubtedly, but for most hardcore fans, more is always more. Consider the families who will now be paying for three movies instead of one, as well as the 3D surcharge, and must then wait another two years to finish the story. They're shown a footnote of a narrative here and that's not right."

","Now don't get me wrong from the summary, I did enjoy The Hobbit. I enjoyed it in fact more than I expected to especially since I delayed watching them because of certain fears and frustrations I had regarding it.<br/><br/>The Hobbit was the very first book I read back in the mid 80's and I adored it. I simply couldn't figure out how it could be turned into a trilogy! I feared it was being done so to milk the franchise and let's be honest that's exactly why it was done.<br/><br/>The Hobbit has most of the charm of LOTR and all of its beauty. Top that off with a stellar cast and it was destined to do well at the box office (Which it did) However something was different, something was.....off.<br/><br/>Though the film contains the same level of violence as LOTR its overflowing with comedy and goofiness. I expected some, but not to this extent. At one point it felt like I was watching Labyrinth (1986) again, not like that's a bad thing but I didn't expect it here.<br/><br/>It looks great, its scored near perfectly and as mentioned the cast do a great performance and it was nice to see the likes of James Nesbitt and Sylvester McCoy up on the big screen.<br/><br/>Inevitably there was going to be comparison with LOTR, that was inescapable and the comparison just doesn't help it at all. It pales in comparison and with all the silliness I found myself underwhelmed.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a passable effort but is more like the Mythica series than Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>Beautiful <br/><br/>Excellent score <br/><br/>Brilliant cast <br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/>Some parts go beyond comedic into the realms of silly <br/><br/>Martin Freeman just isn't leading man material <br/><br/>Goblin town song, really? <br/><br/>Stock scream was totally unnecessary <br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie: <br/><br/>Someone should never use the term ""Mothers glory box"" again <br/><br/>The distance Bilbo's sword needs to detect orcs/goblins changes between scenes, any particular reason?"
"m_a_singer","2","123","200","26 December 2012"," It's not adaptation - it's bastardization
","I am bitterly disappointed by this film. It's noisy, jumbled, and chaotic, far too violent (it was a children's book, for heaven's sake!), and almost completely formless. The action sequences are just ridiculous, and what's worse is that they look fake - maybe an artifact of filming a 3D movie and then showing a 2D version, but something that you can't say of the LoTR movies. This was like a not very attractive cartoon.<br/><br/>Morevoer, even as stuffed to the gills as it is with material from Tolkien's appendices to LoTR and other things that should make the world come alive and draw you in to the back story, much of it doesn't makes sense. It's just a blitz of portentous talking between fights and chases. The acting may not be all bad, but nobody's even on screen long enough to actually act or is given anything to *do*. Ian McKellen's Gandalf has become a caricature and his performance no more than a collection of tics and mannerisms. Sylvester McCoy is embarrassing. At least half the dwarfs aren't' given enough actual acting time to create characters, which just makes the film even more cartoon-like.<br/><br/>Overall, watching The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was about as much fun as watching someone play World of Warcraft. I hate to say it, but even as someone who has been a scholarly Tolkien geek for decades, I may not bother to see the moves that are to follow. I'm afraid that may be a rather common reaction, too. Oh, well - maybe it will turn people toward reading the book (and Tolkien's other work) to see what the fuss was really about."
"Munin75","9","648","1131","13 December 2012"," The rather numerous negative professional reviews almost made me lose hope. Turns out they were wrong. The Hobbit is a fantastic film.
","First of all, let me first say that while I enjoyed the LOTR trilogy, and admired the directorial and technical greatness of it, I'm no LOTR fanboy, and I also recognize its flaws. I'm saying this so that one understands that I'm not the type of person who will blindly speak greatly of any film of the Tolkien/Jackson series if I don't feel it deserves it.<br/><br/>This being said, I have difficulties understanding some of the negative professional reviews which said The Hobbit is a failed attempt, and not as good as LOTR. The artistic and directing style are exactly the same (so I won't comment on this more). I also wasn't expecting to like the 48 fps since I'm the kind of guy who squints even at high definition TVs, but surprisingly, I thought it looked great in The Hobbit, and I think 48 fps is the future. There are slow moments in The Hobbit, broken regularly by excitingly over the top action scenes. Again, just like LOTR - so I don't see why one would like the original trilogy and not The Hobbit.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is perhaps a little less dark in tone than LOTR, considering the source material which is more of a children's book, but it's clearly not a children's movie anyway, and displays many exciting and stressful moments. It also offers something more than the LOTR, that is five genuinely important villains right then and there. The dragon Smaug, in this first film, is like Sauron in the LOTR. A distant, mysterious figure who is the ultimate goal of the quest, whom we don't see much of yet, but we know it's going to be brutal. The ""necromancer"" is mostly alluded. Those who know the book will know who that is, and he'll surely be important in the sequels. Azog, the giant orc, is a main villain and is much more appealing than the Uruk-hai chief in Fellowship of the Ring, or any other orc villain in the LOTR series. The Goblin King also has a strong key role in the movie. And of course, Gollum, who's riddle scene with Bilbo is fantastic.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman as Bilbo is superb and there couldn't be a better choice. The rest of the cast is pitch perfect as well. While the 13 dwarfs are too many for us to get to know each and every one of them well enough by the end of this first movie, I didn't feel it was a downer. We got to know at least a third sufficiently - and I'm sure we'll get to learn about and appreciate the rest in the subsequent films - this allows us to still have characters to discover later on.<br/><br/>Anyway, great film. I think it's better than Fellowship, and I'll be seeing it again for sure and can't wait for the sequels."
"BeholdTheBloodshed","8","182","310","29 December 2012"," The Hobbit turns out to be a rather unexpected delight
","Firstly, I have to make a statement- the LOTR movies, for me, have set an impossibly high bar both in this universe and within the movie world as a whole. Their cinematic beauty and value cannot be denied.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, however, is an entirely different movie. Sure, it's set in the world of Middle Earth, but that's really about all it holds in common with the aforementioned trilogy, alongside a few familiar faces. Many members of the audience I was in complained that the movie took a long time to get going, but it actually was paced rather well, with a suitably sized introduction with Ian Holm and Elijah Wood making way for the current storyline. The first thing you notice as a viewer is that this movie is notably funnier. Whilst the LOTR trilogy had it's lighter moments, The Hobbit revels in the lighter side of life, with lots of genuinely hilarious moments interspersing themselves with scenes of real peril.The visually stunning moments are still there, and whilst I saw this movie in 2D, some moments would have been absolutely perfect in 3D. At first, it's a little difficult to get into, especially when the light-hearted opening with the countless visiting dwarfs gets underway. However, if you can remind yourself as a viewer that The Hobbit was a book written for a much younger, impressionable audience, then you'll likely have a good time watching this. That said, it is far from childish, and although it is a lighter, more fun affair, there are still many parts within the story that an adult audience can relate to.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman has been a firm favourite of mine since his humble beginnings on British terrestrial television, and seeing him here on the big screen is both a welcome and bizarre experience. That said, his demeanour and technique are perfect for the role of Bilbo Baggins, as he exudes the homely, simple manner of a Hobbit very effectively. Ian McKellen is perfect as everyone's favourite wizard, and Richard Armitage (another former British television star playing his trade to the silver screen)is a brilliant Thorin (son of Thrain!), mixing a toughened heart with a tortured soul. If anything, Thorin may turn out to be the true hero of the piece. The rest of the dwarfs are also brilliant, and many of them are the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are once again spectacular, with the eye wateringly stunning rock giant battle a particularly memorable moment. The makeup effects are up to the job, too, and the attention to detail is ridiculous, right down to the individual scratches and weathered look of the weapons the characters wield. If you enjoyed the LOTR trilogy, then Peter Jackson will have you in awe again, although The Hobbit trilogy looks set to be a much more relaxed and 'fun' adventure. At the end of the day, the only complain to be made about the movie is that it simply isn't LOTR. Those movies set such a high level that even Peter Jackson himself can't seem to top them with this effort, but that's a minor complain for what is otherwise I very well made movie.<br/><br/>Cinematic, adventurous, enjoyable and epic- The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey knows its audience and caters to them very well indeed."
"waitera-558-48363","4","136","231","18 December 2012"," Huge disappointment
","If misstepping were an aerobic exercise, Peter Jackson would be in excellent shape. Although I am loath to admit it, this adaptation of ""The Hobbit"" is unsatisfactory in many, many ways. It strikes me as Tolkien meets ""Bad Taste,"" meets ""Braindead,"" meets the Feeblest excuse for a three-film extravaganza. After foolishly buying tickets for two screenings in advance, I have now had the displeasure of seeing the film twice in 3D HFR. The experience leaves me embarrassed to have invested so much gleeful anticipation into the release of this film. It very nearly taints my love for the LotR films, though in the end that love remains intact. Here are just a few of the serious issues I observed: 1. The screenplay departs wildly from the heart of this whimsical tale. Two themes are central to the book: first, the moral bankruptcy arising from greed and the lust for gold. This stems in part from Tolkien's adaptation of the Volsungsaga, wherein a dwarf turns into a dragon through greed. Thorin is becoming a dragon (metaphorically). Second, the self-discovery of Bilbo and his emerging moral strength, set within the symbolism of a seasonal journey from spring to spring. This first film does almost nothing to set up these points, aside from some cringe-worthy and heavy-handed dialogue that violates PJ's oft-stated stricture against saying instead of showing (in film). Bilbo's development is too sudden and inadequately motivated in the film. What little emotional payoff exists is forced and manipulated, not earned by what precedes.<br/><br/>2. Other weak choices in the screenplay include the following: (a) inappropriate lowbrow humor (is the whole audience supposed to be ten years old?); (b) frequent, pointless references to LotR dialogue (compare ""The key is yours now"" to ""The ring is yours now,"" to cite just one example); (c) excessive exposition and flashbacks; and (d) heavy-handed clunkers everywhere (along the lines of Legolas's ""a diversion"" zinger in RotK (for example, ""if there's a key, there must be a door"" or ""after sickness bad things happen). Seems the screenwriters aren't counting on an intelligent audience.<br/><br/>3. Mystifying errors: (a) the grass is golden brown in the land before Rivendell. It should be June, not late summer. One expects more green. Yet Thorin says earlier that the summer has nearly passed. This ruins the seasonal symbolism of the journey. This is not the much-vaunted fidelity to text. Jackson invents material needlessly, and never for the better; (b) Why do the dwarfs gawk at Balin's back-story about Thorin as if they hadn't already heard it? (c) Why is there no blood on Bilbo's sword after he stabs the orc near the end of the movie? This road goes ever on and on, but I'll stop here.<br/><br/>4. Mystifying plot/story decisions (fodder for cuts): (a) Azog is ridiculous, fake-looking, and pointless; (b) Radagast has no place in this film and is beyond ridiculous with his bird-poop hair and stupid bunny-sled; (c) even Rankin/Bass understood that the place for the Erebor back-story was to insert visuals over the song at Bag End: the song is an oral history of dwarfs. So PJ gave us the same story twice, and the first time told by the wrong person (Bilbo); (d) the stone giants are way over the top, recycling Moria and Caradhras staging from FotR, and badly overstating the way Tolkien tends to invest nature with intention; (e) the White Council should, at best, have been shifted to the second film (as part of the Mirkwood material); the desperate attempt to darken the story by including the Necromancer completely unbalanced the tone. Overall, the narrative structure of the film is confused, with a gross overemphasis on set-piece action, so unbelievable as to jar the viewer right out of the film. It lacks enchantment and it lacks an understanding of the source material.<br/><br/>5. The 3D HFR, though spectacular at times, is a nearly total catastrophe, or perhaps the film was not ready for release. Everything outdoors is badly over-lit. The worst example is the company riding through a rainstorm, where (a) they appear to be moving in between the raindrops and (b) the sun appears to be shining everywhere from all directions. The characters do not blend organically with their environments. Rivendell looks like a matte painting. The film is often (but not always) ugly, period. And I don't see how the 3D served the storytelling at all, moths flying out into the theater notwithstanding. Spectacle is not a substitute for character development and emotional resonance, both of which this film sorely lacked.<br/><br/>Enough. Sir Peter: please, I beg of you, try to fix these sorts of problems in the next two films. This entry was dreadful, in spite of the widespread (apparent) fan adulation. You are better than this. I fear the cinematic ""precious"" is lost . . . loooost!"
"Tweekums","7","36","55","9 April 2013"," The first of three long films based on a short book
","As this film opens an elderly Bilbo Baggins explains how the once great Dwarfs were forced out of their mountain kingdom by the dragon Smaug. He begins to talk of a great adventure and we are transported back to shortly before the adventure began when a young Bilbo meets the wizard Gandalf the Grey. He invites Bilbo on an adventure but he declines; the next day thirteen Dwarfs turn up at Bilbo's home believing that they have been invited. They tell him of their quest but he initially refuses; he has no desire to leave home. The next morning he changes his mind and so begins a quest that will see them fighting trolls, orcs and goblins as well as meeting elves, another wizard and in Bilbo's case the somewhat crazed Smeagol who will become a lifelong enemy following the theft of a certain ring.<br/><br/>Before watching this the main criticism I'd heard was that breaking the story into three long films was a mistake; having seen it I'm inclined to agree. The story took too long to get started and when it did it got nowhere fast; the party had a succession of battles but there was never the sense of danger that there was in the Lord of the Rings films. Another weakness was the fact that the party was a large group of dwarfs with one hobbit and one wizard rather than the more mixed group in the earlier trilogy; only a couple of them stood out from the group; the rest were very much the same. On the plus side the film looked great with many sweeping shots though action set in a spectacular landscape and the actors did a decent enough job; I particularly enjoyed seeing Andy Serkis' return as Smeagol even though he is doing motion-capture work for a CGI character. Overall I'd say this is worth watching if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy even though it isn't as good as those films hopefully the next instalment will improve matters."

No, this was just a waste of 3 hours of my life.<br/><br/>Then the movie itself doesn't make sense, some examples: - the whole group except Gandalf is deep down a Gobelin mine, fighting the king and obviously loosing the battle.

And of course after that they have to run for hours to find the exit, instead of taking the path Gandalf took to enter ( or teleport back ). - again in the Gobelin mine, right before the exit, they defy all gravity rules, the king falls down first, then the bridge they stand on (which they use as a skateboard of course), and when they reach the bottom they get crushed 5 minutes later by the king who finally decided to finish his descent... - why did Gandalf call the giant eagles at the end of the trip and not on the beginning? Due to a lack of mots in the beginning area?<br/><br/>And I skip all the parts not in the book, just created to extend the length of the movie, allowing for 3 episodes.<br/><br/>Finally, I must admit the special effects are stunning, but all fights (and there are many of them) have a big problem; either you see the movie at 48fps and you have a big chance of getting sick (just google it) either your eyes will hurt at the end of the movie because of the fast and blurry scenes."

","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" simultaneously takes director Peter Jackson in two different directions. While at first glance it may seem that he is travelling over familiar ground, again tackling the fantastical world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth after his vast and Academy Award wining ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001 – 2003), he is actually experimenting with cinema itself.<br/><br/>Of all the art forms of the world, film is the one most invested in technology; created by scientists, not artists at the end of the nineteenth century. It was only at the dawn of the last century that people like Georges Méliès realised the potential of this medium. So it is appropriate that Jackson is here breaking new ground with the very way we watch films. Instead of shooting at the normal speeds of twenty four frames per second, he has doubled it to forty eight frames a second so when viewed you have an astonishing clarity of detail as well as smoothness in camera movement with no motion stutter or blurry jerkiness when shown in 3D.<br/><br/>However, this raises a problem for the filmmaker. For a film set in a mythical fantasy land, any poor special effects or sub-standard computer generated imagery will stand out glaringly. So the effects work from Weta Digital is all the more impressive and astounding; from skin textures to the manifold buildings of Rivendell, it's sometimes hard to believe it's not all real.<br/><br/>The acting, from Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen to Christopher Lee as Saruman and Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, leader of the dwarfs, are all very good, inhabiting their roles with conviction and passion. Stand out though is Andy Serkis as Gollum, the famous riddle scene from the novel imported virtually word for word, and is all the better for it. Serkis has an uncanny ability to play these none too human characters with an enormous amount of vicissitude, a feat he pulls of here again with aplomb. <br/><br/>This is primarily a visual motion picture, but the characters are not ignored and the extensive opening sequence set in Bilbo's house serves as an introduction of sorts to not just the people but the themes as well.<br/><br/>Jackson directs with huge scope and a true feeling for the vast land he is creating, shot on location in New Zealand. The sweeping cinematography from Andrew Lesnie is suitably epic, making the landscape another character in the film.<br/><br/>The film does have its flaws, mainly due to the fact that this is an introduction to a trilogy and not a self-contained movie; people might also find Radagast the Brown, a wizard, as played by Sylvester McCoy, to fall on perhaps the wrong side of immaturity. Still, this is a fantastic piece of entertainment and it's hard to imagine a better Christmas film."

Whereas in the LOTR trilogy you really got that sense of a grand cinematic epic, it just wasn't there in this version. I really wanted it to be something new and exciting, but it looked gimmicky and false a lot of the time, only the latter scenes with the Pale Orc and Bilibo's encounter with Gollum drew me into the movie. At times the image, crystal clear as its was, did feel like a HD home camcorder had been used and certain scenes did seem sped up. What is interesting is watching the trailer at home on a home cinema setup, it looked much more like LOTR in quality and feel then the IMAX version. This is the first ever movie using this technology so I will give it the benefit of the doubt, but eagerly await the Blu-Ray in a years time.<br/><br/>The story itself suffers from the feeling of being padded out at every opportunity, I have no idea why we had to see cameo's of Frodo and Galadriel, I believe even Legolas will make an appearance in a future episode. The Hobbit is a very different story, which can be read in an afternoon, it does not need to be a 9 hour epic like it's predecessors.<br/><br/>The dwarfs comedy seemed over hammed, feeling very corny at times, the troll scene was nowhere near as good as the books, and why omit Gandalf's voice throwing?<br/><br/>I'm not even going anywhere near the mess that a certain Brown wizard brought to the film.<br/><br/>As a lifelong fan of Tolkien's work, and Mr Jackson's LOTR trilogy I left very disappointed.<br/><br/>Here's hoping the second installment is an ""Empire Strikes Back"" and redeems PJ's credibility"

But why the heck did PJ have to do a ""different angle"" section of Bilbo's birthday party, and then just stop to carrying on?

"trodfar","4","41","67","6 January 2013"," Peter Jackson lost on this one
","The Hobbit is a relatively short book written as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is NOT a trilogy, and even though LOTR is comfortably presented as a trilogy, it was written to be one very long book in three parts.<br/><br/>The Hobbit would have made a fine movie-- a single movie. There is enough characters, places and creepy scary things to jam-pack a good 2 1/2 hour cinematic experience. But Jackson lost when he took a short book, wrote a screenplay for three movies, added unnecessary characters and plot lines wholly irrelevant to Tolkien's intent, failed to expand on perfectly good themes inherent in the book, and overwhelmed the viewer with a saturated screen in almost every scene.<br/><br/>In the first places, dwarfs work in mines traditionally because they are small humans with corresponding human strength, and they can fit where normal humans cannot go. Funny thing is, most of the dwarfs in this movie do not look like dwarfs at all! <br/><br/>Inasmuch as I love Bilbo Baggins-- and the choice of the adorable Martin Freeman was an excellent one-- this movie should have been called ""Thorin Oakenshield"", rather than ""The Hobbit"". Most of the story and camera time is spent on Thorin and his greedy pursuit of gold (which is changed for political correctness to read: we need a homeland!). I would have loved to have seen more of the Shire, more of Bilbo doing his Hobbty things, BEFORE the deluge of the 13 uninvited dwarfs.<br/><br/>The best scene in the entire movie was with Bilbo and Gollum. Fine camera-work, excellent CGI, excellent acting, perfect timing. Serkus should get an Oscar whether the character is CGI or not.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes in The Hobbit is the rescue from the Orcs by the eagles. Tolkien is clear to show the size difference between the races of Middle Earth-- large wizard, small dwarfs, even smaller Hobbit. I was disappointed that in most scenes Bilbo looks the same size as the dwarfs. It would have been sharper and truer to the story to make sure he was CGI-ed into a smaller fellow yet.<br/><br/>The Hobbit was written for a younger audience than LOTR and the language and imagery is thus more suitable to pre-teens. If Jackson had kept the childlike nature of the story going, rather than making a good half or more of it of fierce, endless and repetitive battle scenes, it would have been a better movie. No charm! No magic! it was just a bunch of brutal battles where everyone continues to escape unscathed! A cartoon version would have been more realistic.<br/><br/>The funniest scene in the whole movie would be for Monty Python fans alone. When the group reaches sight of the elven city, Bilbo exclaims, his face full to the camera, ""RIVENDELL""!!! It reminded me of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table in turn exclaiming ""CAMELOT!"" (""shhhh! it's only a model"") I cannot believe that Jackson could not see that reference (or maybe he really did!)<br/><br/>Jackson has gotten too Middle-Earthed for his own good. My hope is that the next installments produce some of the charm of the Bilbo-Gollum scene without loosing the beauty of its New Zealand scenery. Slow down, less fighting, more time to see the scenery, more time to know the characters. We don't need more big sloppy ugly things to fight!"

","First, let me say the Lord of the Rings movies were all first-rate and stayed pretty close to the original Tolkien books. Unfortunately, The Hobbit is not, because it does not. It really is a bad movie by design. Choices were made to add slapstick comedy and fabricate added story lines which bloat, rather than add, to the movie, and quite simply to stray from the book liberally (presumably) for commercial reasons. The choice to do so is curious given the overwhelming success (commercial and critical) of the LOTR formula of being faithful to the books.<br/><br/>Radagast, for example, who was mentioned in name only in the book, appears in the movie as something of an idiot wizard riding a sleigh powered by eight tiny... bunnies. I'm not kidding. This is perhaps the worst example of how Peter Jackson has botched the story and put the LOTR movie franchise at risk of ruin, presumably to appeal to a younger crowd and stretch it into 3 movies for commercial purposes. There are many other examples of this, which cause you to leave Tolkien's world and wonder why the story was cheapened and botched at the hands of a director who did so well with the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>I didn't mind fleshing out the 'necromancer' story line that was only hinted at in the book. But so many of the best scenes in the first part of the book were all disappointing in the movie, having been altered for the worse. <br/><br/>Lastly, I don't like how they changed the character of Bilbo Baggins. In the book, Bilbo (and the dwarfs for that matter) are basically out- matched and scared when the meet up with each of the foes in the first part of the book. Bilbo, after reluctantly joining the group, is basically scared and miserable the whole first part of the book. In the movie, Bilbo is portrayed more as a home-body who'd just rather be at home, but not terribly scared of trolls or orcs or goblins or dragons, they're just not really his cup of tea. And the somewhat fabricated theme toward the end of Bilbo deciding to help the dwarfs 'find their home' and help them get their home back is another disappointing alteration.<br/><br/>There are many smaller details of the movie that also work to cheapen it, but I think you get the picture. The only reason for 2-stars instead of 1-star is the production values, which are as good as the LOTR trilogy. The movie is nominated for a makeup and production design Academy Awards, but a telling comparison with the LOTR trilogy is the absence of any nominations for writing or direction or picture. Both 'Fellowship' & 'Return' won best adapted screenplay,and were nominated for Best Picture ('Return' won). The Hobbit could be nominated for worst-adapted screenplay- and seems was a conscious, if incredibly poor, choice by the writers and director- who did so well adapting LOTR to the screen.<br/><br/>Equally disappointing is what might have been. Instead of adding superfluous story lines, they could have made The Hobbit much smaller in scale compared to LOTR (which it is) and more personal. Instead of starting with a Bilbo that is something of a home-body and not into adventures, they could have started with a Bilbo who secretly always wanted to go on an adventure- but was too afraid and too conforming to society to do so- until Gandalf pushed him along (in the book Bilbo was always into maps, etc. which is meant to suggest this). From there, they could have portrayed the company of dwarfs as serious and determined in their purpose, but totally unprepared for the challenges that awaited them. There could have also been some focus on how miserable Bilbo was in the conditions- the mud, no food,and longing for home- and the friction and disrespect for him by most of the dwarfs. They might have also included how the elves made fun of them when they arrived in Rivendell, and Gandalf's own disdain for many of their failings, and that their adventure isn't his main concern. Adding a troll scene that was true to the book would make a far more compelling Act I.<br/><br/>Act II could have started with the company entering the mountains and the cave scene. Instead of having them fall hundreds of feet through a trap door unscathed, followed by an hour of slapstick gore battle sequences, they could have had the goblins catch them and bring them chained through the tight confines of the dark tunnels in the book, rather than the expansive open pits in the movie. Being faithful to the book in this case would have led to more suspense and terror- like when the Black Riders first appeared in 'Fellowship'. That would have set the stage for Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, and a more tense, drawn-out riddle scene where Bilbo is more at risk and Gollum in control. After a tense escape from the tunnels- once again finding themselves out-matched by the goblins and wargs as they get trapped a top burning pine trees (as in the book), only to be saved once again- this time by the eagles. Expanding the 'necromancer' story line, which I thought a worthwhile addition, might add some time and make it about a 2 hour movie, with still plenty of plot for an additional 2 hour finale.<br/><br/>As it was, I came away thinking of a line that Gandalf used after recounting the story of Bullroarer Took to Bilbo early in the movie. When Bilbo replied ""you made that up"" Gandalf replied, ""all good stories have some embellishments."" Perhaps this line served as a bad excuse for what was to follow. The Hobbit already was a good fantasy story, as time has proved. It didn't need slapstick and gore embellishments. It's too bad Peter Jackson couldn't leave well enough alone- to the ruin of the LOTR movie franchise."
"tubby1","5","77","134","19 December 2012"," Why three hours?
","On learning that The Hobbit, a 400 page children's book was to be extended over three films (Unexpected Journey being the first) it seemed Peter Jackson may have been seeking a compromise between the children friendly book and the more darker and foreboding LOTR trilogy. Unsurprisingly, An Unexpected Journey fails to transcend the source material, although it is debatable if this was Jackson's intention.<br/><br/>The first fifty minutes is actually the most impactful (Gollum's appearance not too far behind). There are nice homage's to LOTR and it provides the necessary back-story. Most importantly, it enables the twelve dwarfs to be more than a generic rabble just fighting and squabbling. Martin Freeman starts as he ends the film, playing Bilbo Baggins with aplomb, in a fine performance, providing the understated and yet determined nature of the intrepid adventurer. Once Bilbo leaves Bag End however the magic ceases.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a number of set-pieces which fail to propel the story. What we have is an A to B to C without an emotional arch or purposeful plot. One continues to watch An Unexpected Journey waiting for Jackson to rein in on the needless superfluous activity but it does not happen. It is at this juncture that one begins to accept, rather belatedly, that An Unexpected Journey is not the cross-over adaptation that one may have hoped. Jackson's 'off-the-map' excursion with Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf and Saruman only help to conflate rather than placate the elder viewer.<br/><br/>The special effects are satisfactory, if not altogether an improvement on LOTR. Unfortunately, this is for me An Unexpected Journey's biggest fault. It becomes apparent through the effects that Jackson has decided, pardon the juxtaposition, 'evil-friendly'. The appearance of the Great Goblin and his cohorts, Azogand his wolves are much less menacing than LOTR and have an intentional illusory, and non-frightening composition. Can one even forgive the over-intrusive nature of the subtitles? <br/><br/>If more credence is needed that An Unexpected Journey is a more youthful creation one only need to look at the manner in which Bilbo comes across Gollum, and the way in which the Company fall into the Goblin Kingdom. One has to suspend disbelief at the comic book survival skills of the party (noticeably altered from the book too).<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey does have its moments. There is some fun bravado, a couple of meaningful montages, and some much needed pathos. The acting is of the highest quality.<br/><br/>I have to conclude that An Unexpected Journey was intended for a younger audience, and I cannot begrudge Jackson for this. However, the three hour long running time is just unnecessary when to all intents and purposes a longer film would be more inclined to an older audience. As a consequence An Unexpected Journey should be cut with big scissors. A big disappointment and I only hope that parts two and three try to provide a more menacing and intelligent cross-over."
"PlugInYourBrain","4","43","71","29 March 2013"," Thanks for the Video Game. When is the Movie coming out?
","Everyone expected The Hobbit to be a different movie from LOTR. LOTR is dark and sombre. The Hobbit is a children's book, albeit one that appeals to adults. We were expecting a lighter movie. What we got was a mess.<br/><br/>Jackson has made major changes to the book. That in itself isn't a bad: The LOTR book had weaknesses that Jackson's screenplay fixed, but the Hobbit was already a good ""film size"" book that didn't need changes. Jackson's rewrites, aimed at stretching a short book into three overly long films, ruined a good story.<br/><br/>An example is the addition of the White Orc whose gang chase the dwarfs everywhere. This boring, 1-dimensional villain gives an excuse for additional fight scenes, but these are emotionally unengaging. You never feel that anything is at stake.<br/><br/>Some have said Jackson had to stick to the source material. The thing is, he didn't. Everything has been rewritten into a fight scene. We have the absurdity at Trollshaws that the dwarfs attack the trolls, but then we wouldn't have Gandalf's iconic line ""Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!"" So the dwarfs put down their weapons and crawl into sacks to be eaten. LOLWOT? Gandalf's voice throwing is cut from the film, replaced with some unfunny dialog about worms. It doesn't add anything. It's not funny. It's change purely for the sake of change.<br/><br/>It's not like Jackson lightened it up to make it more appealing to kids: There is a lot of violence (e.g. Gandalf stabs the goblin king in the eye then slashes his belly open). Jackson just doesn't show any blood. No blood = kids movie. Got it?<br/><br/>Jackson added other tie-ins to the LOTR to try and pad the story out, but like the unnecessary cameos they will only make you groan. Jackson now even suggests Gandalf orchestrated the dwarf journey as a deliberate precursor to LOTR, as if he had an instinct that Bilbo would find the ring. It really makes no sense.<br/><br/>Dol Guldur was a wonderfully creepy place in the LOTR books, although it never appeared in the Hobbit. Jackson has Radaghast, a supposedly powerful wizard show up, flee in a panic after he sees a ghost. A ghost that can't even swing a sword. It just doesn't make sense. And then there is Radaghast's rabbit sled. Again not in the book. It's not funny. It's just stupid.<br/><br/>Much like George Lucas' flying R2D2, Jackson has changed characters. When Saruman and Gandalf fight in LOTR Jackson said he didn't want anything clichéd like Wizard Lightning. Yet in the Hobbit Gandalf's flash of light suddenly becomes a fireball killing hundreds of goblins at a time. Well gee Gandalf. Why didn't you tell us you could do that?<br/><br/>Jackson's elves have never looked like elves in any movie: More like blonde people with pointy ears, but in LOTR his dwarfs looked like dwarfs. In The Hobbit most of the dwarfs look like humans. Ridiculously Aragon... sorry, Thorin ... is man candy for female cinema-goers. What do you think, ladies? Come for the disembowelments? Stay for the romance? Like the whole Liv Tyler character he wrote into LOTR, it just doesn't work. Jackson needs to do a few romcoms to get it out of his system.<br/><br/>The CGI is very overdone. Characters fall from great heights. They get squashed by rocks. They walk away without a scratch. It feels a lot like a video game. You never feel emotionally invested. If Jackson must do rewrites, he should have killed some of the dwarfs. There are 13 of them after all, and losing a couple would have helped the audience care more about the ones that are left.<br/><br/>In the book the goblins lived in tunnels. In the movie they live in absurdly overdone CGI caverns. Someone needs to tell Jackson sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>How did Jackson, a director with such a good track record, make such a bad movie? Sometimes directors come out with good movies (e.g. George Lucas) and we think they are the hand of god. But then they come out with more movies, and you wonder if there isn't some luck involved or uncredited people in the background who weren't there this time? Jackson's King Kong shows not everything he touches turns to gold. Jackson is obviously overconfident, and the studio was too, but like George Lucas even if Jackson laid a steaming turd it would still make been hugely profitable. We've already hailed Jackson a genius, so he has nothing to prove to us except to make a lot of money. He's also very into video games. This movie feels very much like a video game.<br/><br/>The only good parts in this movie: Smaug's raid at the beginning, and Gollum's riddle scene. For 15 minutes out of 3 hours you will be entertained. The rest is slow, boring and emotionally unengaging; silly without being funny. The CGI is overdone. Being a Middle Earth story many people will see the movie anyway, and most will be disappointed."
"permansson87","4","88","155","16 December 2012"," Expected an epic adventure-Got a CGI roller coaster.
","The movie starts out as a warm return to middle-earth, we get a nice background-story of how the dwarfs lost their hometown, Erebor, to Smaug, the gold-seeking dragon. Smaug settles down beneath the abandoned city to guard the dwarf gold and especially the huge jewel, ""the heart of the mountain"" which the dwarfs found deep inside the mountain.<br/><br/>The build-up is very good, we get a nice transition from the aged Bilbo, on the day of his birthday and the huge party (which takes place in the first LOTR book/movie) to a younger version of the same, a hobbit who mostly spends his time alone in his hole and is absolutely not seeking any adventures(Or even any visitors). <br/><br/>Before the scene with Gandalf and the Dwarfs at Bilbo's house is over it's been almost 40 min of the movie already but the pace works considering it's supposed to be 3 movies and the movie is brilliant so far any way so you don't mind the long scenes.<br/><br/>So far so good, what could go wrong with such a nice beginning? Well, apparently quite a lot. <br/><br/>Somewhere along the journey the movie turns into transformers in middle- earth were every action scene is like taken out of a video game scenario, with the main characters either bouncing around on platforms falling 100 meters a turn, dodging boulders from stone giants or playing domino with trees. Between the horrible Michael Bay inspired action we get comic relief from stereotypical characters like Bombur the fat dwarf and the thin dwarf with slingshot, whatever his name was, as well as Radagast, the escaped mental patient/wizard.<br/><br/>The major problem with the action scenes is that all the main characters feels invulnerable, they narrowly escape death ten times per scene whilst joking it off or not showing any real emotions.<br/><br/>The journey does at no point feel like a struggle or a huge task like with Frodo and Sam in LOTR where you half wondered if they were going to make it, even while having read the books.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman does a good job as Bilbo, at least the first half hour and in the Gollum scene, in between those scenes you almost forget Bilbo is in the movie at all, because his screen-time is quite limited for a main character.<br/><br/>Another issue, a visual one, is the main villain, Azog the albino-orc. The problem is he's in CGI which makes him look really sh*t and out of place compared to the orcs with make-up, the difference was very obvious in some scenes. His backstory with Thorin was very far-stretched and didn't help the plot at all.<br/><br/>Overall a mediocre and forgettable movie, while some scenes were enjoyable, especially the beginning and the riddle scene with Gollum/Bilbo, the rest of the movie was a train-wreck. It's a mystery to me how some people call it a masterpiece."
"haris_manda","7","602","1165","8 December 2012"," Expectations weren't high ENOUGH
","I was a mere child when I watched LOTR franchise and I still liked it. Ever since, year by year, I grew fonder and fonder of the movies and they remain, and probably forever will, one of my favorite movies of all time. I've read all the books countless times (including Hobit) and when I saw that Hobbit was coming into the cinema, my mind was entirely wiped away from its existence due to excitement that entered me. <br/><br/>Now, movie review. <br/><br/>As expected from Peter - almost flawless masterpiece. Given that he had a lot of material to work with, I imagine it was quite hard to put everything together for the scenery - yet he did it, once more. He captured the feeling of the book and transcended it onto a screen; of course, it was not solely his credit, to not be mistaken. The acting was amazing - perfectly fitting into fantasy style. The chemistry between actors was more than just the obvious - you could actually feel their interactions and live the story. Yes, it was that good. <br/><br/>I have no need to begin writing about camera work and all that comes with it; locations were beautiful, effects and colors were mixed perfect, a soundtrack that followed through pattered with what was going on perfectly ... it is really one of those moments when you simply can't say enough because you know, regardless of how many words you put in, you still won't be able to describe things the way you felt them. I have only one thing to say: congratulations Mr. Jackson and rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey will become classic without any doubt; I am just glad that I got to be a part of the generation that witnessed the never-dying franchise of Mr. Tolkien's work."
"elmeeksio","8","114","205","7 January 2013"," Great start to a new Trilogy!
","First off I have never read The Hobbit, but from what I gather the book isn't all that long, so the fact that this film is the first of three, suggests they may be milking it a little. That being said however I was very excited to return to Middle Earth for a new story..and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.<br/><br/>This is the Prequel story to LOTR following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Frodo's Uncle played by Ian Holm previously) and how he came to be in possession on the ring. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. .is quite simply a BEAUTIFUL film! I saw the movie in 3D and at the 48fps that Jackson intended and I was blown away by how it looked. It's a stunning film that left me with the same 'WOW' factor that the original trilogy did a decade ago. Set 60 years earlier than Lord of The Rings, We are introduced to a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). He is a content Hobbit, not concerned with adventure of any sort. Until Gandalf (Ian McKellan) suddenly appears, along with a group of unruly Dwarfs and offers Bilbo the chance to be part of a great adventure. The dwarfs wish to reclaim their homeland, which has been taken over by a huge dragon named Smaug, It's a simple concept and one that probably shouldn't be stretched over 3 movies but as with any 'first in a trilogy' film, it sets the stage perfectly. The movie has some great scenes.. meeting the Dwarfs in Bilbo's house, the run in with fighting stone giants and the escape from deep within the goblins' mountain are particular highlights. I loved the scene in which Bilbo runs into a familiar face (for LOTR fans) in the caves: Gollum (who looks amazing with todays MOCAP technology). Much of the movie, is the journey of the troupe back to the mountain, but also the journey of Bilbo himself.. mild and timid at the start of the film, our hero finds his courage, several times over, through the course of this film. <br/><br/>Overall I loved this film, I thought it looked fantastic and the care of attention not just aesthetically but also in terms of continuity were obvious. These are Peter Jacksons films, no doubt. Much like he did with the previous trilogy, bringing us into a world full of heroes and villains, orcs and wizards this film literally (thanks to the 3D and FPS rate) literally transports you into Middle Earth.<br/><br/>I am already excited to see the next instalment but to keep me satisfied until then..i may go and watch my LOTR boxset again . And them maybe this film again!<br/><br/>Great stuff!!"
"garry_hornby","5","60","103","25 December 2012"," They should have asked a Tolkien fan
","The Hobbit suffers from all the faults of LOTR but to a greater degree. Most seriously, the Garden Of Eden that Middle Earth should have been is instead a grey and barren place looking like it all turned into Mordor long ago; it's a land without beauty not worth fighting for and the remaining High Elves ought to depart for Valinor with all due haste. If Dracula ever needs a new abode he'd feel right at home in Rivendell and Moria consists of a series of fragile wooden platforms rather than tunnels lovingly hewn from the living rock over centuries by the Dwarfs.<br/><br/>The jerky action sequences are ludicrous. Jackson persists with having his characters miraculously survive while the world around them crumbles. The company live through their mountain path standing up to become a rock giant, rickety bridges disintegrating into splinters, and being thrown from the tops of tall trees as they are felled by the impact of wargs. I don't recall any of these happenings in the book itself. Why the screen writers felt the need to change the story in these and so many other places I'll never know. If they thought they could improve on the original author, they were very wrong.<br/><br/>If The Hobbit had been made by a Tolkien fan it would have been an infinitely better film. If you are a true Tolkien fan, stay well clear. I'll leave the final word to Christopher Tolkien, who says it far better than I ever could:<br/><br/>""Hollywood has turned Tolkien into a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time. The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away."""

What do you expect? A miracle? It simply didn't happen, this movie sucks from beginning to end and all it achieved, while making tons of money, is to irritate Tolkien's books lovers and connoisseurs (and there are many of us out there).<br/><br/>I doubt Peter Jackson even ever read Tolkien's books, because if he did, THAT would really give his doctors some good reasons to rethink his medication administration.<br/><br/>Peter, life ain't 50% MTV and the rest video-games.

After misunderstanding completely the original story of a masterpiece worth a Nobel, she had the nerve to say she knew better than Tolkien himself how to keep high the tension of the story. She actually said that in an interview, I promise. Probably a pronoid (person convinced, despite any visible evidence, to be considered a genius by everybody). Problem is she isn't close to be as talented as arrogant. Her scripts are awful. Something a bored hair dresser would have better written during the manicure pause while watching Desperate Housewives on TV). Wasn't there a REAL writer available?

"ApeLieUproar","1","41","68","8 May 2013"," An Unbearable Journey
","I hated pretty much everything about this movie, but here are the main points:<br/><br/>Expanding on Tolkien's mythology: Presumably, the reason you should ""never trust an Elf!"" (Gimli's line in TFotR) is because Elves turned their back on the Dwarfs when they were being attacked by Smaug? What were they expected to do against a dragon and why were they just standing there anyway? This is basically adding a whole new level of mythology. A no-no, unless it's an improvement and that's not the case here.<br/><br/>The dwarfs: They looked ridiculous to me and their behavior was annoying. But no dwarf was more off-putting than Thorin with his ludicrous fur-trimmed leather duster, Rob Zombie do and constant glowering. Ugh.<br/><br/>The introductory scene takes too long but, given all this time, you'd think Jackson would try and be more faithful to the book. But, no, he still manages to mangle it. Anyway, the next day, after Bilbo has decided not to go the day before (he wasn't really given the choice in the book), he justgoes. And it's very interesting that he's able to, on foot, overtake Gandalf and the dwarfs all riding along briskly on horseback. And when he does catch up, he's offered a pony, which he at first declines. Why? Bilbo had nothing against riding a pony.<br/><br/>Azog: The footnote springs to cinematic life and has a vendetta against Thorin. But the character in the LotR Appendix, for all of his two-pages of appearance and death at the hands of Dáin, is still more bad-ass than the video game reject in AUJ. Anyway, if Jackson wanted to go this route, it would have made more sense to just go with Azog's son Bolg, who will appear anyway.<br/><br/>Trolls: or, how to take an amusing sequence from the book and drain it of any humor whatsoever. Actually, that opinion applies to the whole movie. But, instead of Gandalf employing ventriloquism on the trolls and getting them to fight each other, Bilbo tells them the dwarfs have parasites and Gandalf gets to break a rock in two. Yawn.<br/><br/>Radagast: An utterly ridiculous and repellent visualization of another footnote character, with his ridiculous dying hedgehog, rabbit-drawn sleigh and poo-smeared face. But that's just my opinion. But why is he in the movie at all? To tell Gandalf about the Necromancer, I guess. But if Gandalf doesn't already know this (as he does in the book) where did he get the map and key from Thráin (Thorin's father) who (in the book) was a prisoner in Dol Guldur? Presumably, he wasn't in Dol Guldur in the movie. So where is he? It's basically glossed over. In any case, the very idea that Greenwood is turning into Mirkwood right before Radagast's eyes at the start of the movie just strikes me as a desperate and weak attempt to create a sense of urgency and menace. The spiders are even seen entering the forest as if to take up their positions. Also in any case, Gandalf's very reason for being in Middle Earth is to help combat the Necromancer (aka Sauron). For him not to know about his presence in Mirkwood is, sorry, just witless.<br/><br/>Apparent invulnerability: None of the protagonists get hurt in this movie. Stone giants fall on them, they get up. They fall a hundred feet, they just walk it off. Goblins (who, for some reason, are portrayed as distinct from orcs) attack in droves, they just cut them down like wheat. Thorin does later fall unconscious (from a blow that should have crushed his skull), but he later turns out none the worse for wear. Even if these characters weren't profoundly irritating, why should I care about them if they're not in any danger? And enough with the fake deaths. Did anyone watching this really fear the titular character might fall to his death halfway through his own movie?<br/><br/>Riddles in the ""Dark"": Finally, some resemblance to the book, except even here there are details changed for no good reason. And couldn't they have toned down the lighting just a bit more to give some impression of darkness? As for Gollum himself, it's hard to find fault with Andy Serkis, except that Gollum is now basically a celebrity and practically played like one in the film. He no longer surprises, frightens or disturbs in the least. The cosy lighting doesn't help at all.<br/><br/>Bilbo the Badass: Bilbo kills a Warg (which, though strong enough to uproot a tree, will drop with a single arrow or sword thrust/hack). Later he savagely kills an orc. Where'd this come from? Perhaps to make up for Frodo being a wuss in those other movies? Whatever the case, it's so far out of left field, it's just seems tacked on.<br/><br/>Eagles: Gandalf just happens to spot a moth nearby in the tree he's climbed up to avoid the orcs and wargs. How convenient. And the book's explanation for the eagles doesn't work because? There really is no good reason. Jackson wants to make full use of the eagles, but only as devices; he's averse to giving them any back story or personality or anything. You'd think with his apparent love of exposition and the characters making speeches all the time, something could have been said about them, but no, the eagles just drop them off and depart. They're nothing more than deus ex machina. Granted, there are challenges to following the book more closely here but I still think Jackson takes the cheap way out.<br/><br/>Final scene: Bilbo blithely states ""I do believe the worst is behind us."" Really? Why would he believe this while looking at a mountain that is 1) still leagues distant; and 2) he knows contains a fire-breathing dragon? <br/><br/>I will be surprised if even morbid curiosity compels me to watch any more of these."

","The movie is amazing. It is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a cinema. The vividness of the colors and light and movement is something to behold. And then the 3D takes it all to another level. It was a little unnerving at times. Almost as if I was watching a hybrid of a movie and a live action performance.<br/><br/>The scenery is, of course, gorgeous. The acting is light, fun, playful while also managing to stay true to the original story. There is a little too much of the side stores for my liking. And it could well have been cut by a half hour or so and still not lost any of it impact and appeal.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is a revelation. Knowing him from The Office (I lived in the UK for a while) it hardly seemed plausible that he could carry off such a role, but he is very believable. The merry band of dwarfs are well played and you somehow get to know each of them by the end of the film. The special effects are, well, special. We were ducking as rocks and boulders came flying out at us and I swear there was a bird floating over our heads at one point. The surround sound was rich and evocative of the caves and the music is lush and emotional.<br/><br/>As for the main story, well, apart from doing a prelude that reprises the role of Frodo and older Bilbo Baggins, it pretty much stays true to the text - with some audience members anticipating what the characters were going to say next.<br/><br/>A word of warning - some of the battle scenes are very intense, made more so by the 3D and high definition used along with the sound effects. You may want to think long and hard about taking young kids to it.<br/><br/>But for everyone else, particularly the young at heart, this first installment of The Hobbit is a gem.<br/><br/>(note: I was very fortunate to see The Hobbit in Wellington last week. I was there on business and through a friend of a friend I landed a ticket. I was in in Cinema 1 of the Reading Cinemas - one of the two cinemas that premiered the film last Wednesday.)"
"dfranzen70","9","221","419","11 December 2012"," Fits perfectly within the LOTR universe
","A shortish book is drawn out to not one but three full-length feature films, the better to flesh out characters who need, uh, fleshing, and the better to tell every bit of the tale. This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, who makes his first appearance as a young lad in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>If I could use just one word to describe the film, it would be ""wow."" Or maybe ""gosh"" or ""gee"" or ""holy COW""...but those are two words, and I am digressing. The movie is in 3D and will also be available in IMAX. I saw it in 3D. It's worth it in 3D. It's a beautiful, stunning film that feels right in line with the earlier Lord of the Rings movies, even though it's set 60 years earlier and derives from what's best described as a children's book.<br/><br/>Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is a hobbit. Hobbits are smaller than you and me. Well, you, anyway. They're short. They live simple lives, and they love it. Theirs is an agrarian society. No magic, no oddities, and above all no adventures. And such is the case with Mr. Baggins, who lives in a home called Bag's End in an area known as The Shire. He is content. Until the mysterious wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) appears suddenly, as is his wont, and offers Bilbo a chance at a grand adventure indeed. It involves several dwarfs who wish to trek back to their homeland, which has been usurped by a huge dragon named Smaug, and reclaim it as their own. I know, it sounds simple and that Bilbo might be slumming by tagging along, but off he goes anyway. Reluctantly.<br/><br/>Now, please bear in mind that, like the LOTR movies, this is just the first of three films. The entire Hobbit story isn't told. That means we spend more time in certain areas than we might have if the book had been filmed in one shot. The unsightly squad, with their faux burglar (Bilbo) run into comical stone giants and put on a rotating spit, then beset by orcs and goblins, and then at some point, deep within the goblins' mountain, Bilbo runs into a familiar (to us) face: Gollum, nee' Smeagol, the keeper of the One Ring. <br/><br/>Much of the movie, with New Zealand stepping in admirably again for Middle-Earth, involves the troupe running from things. Running across fields, down into caves, through caverns, across more fields, up and down mountains, and so on. Lots of running. Considering most of these dwarfs are built like beer kegs and not Kenyan runners, I'm kind of surprised none of them suffer a cardiac arrest or two. But again, digression.<br/><br/>And much of the plot, aside from the standard journey to a faraway land, involves the development of Bilbo as, well, a man. Hobbit, whatever. He's meek and mild, but he finds his courage, several times over, through the course of just this film. The gleaming sword given to him by Gandalf helps a mite, too. But still! Cunning and courage and whatnot from a lowly hobbit! (Literally lowly.)<br/><br/>You will see some familiar faces. Let's just say that Rivendell is on the way, just as it was/will be in the first LOTR movie. There takes place a debate about whether the dwarfs, led by the great Thorin Oakenshield, really should be doing what they're doing. Saruman the White is pretty set against it, but Lady Galadriel seems to trust Gandalf more than anyone. And so our dwarfs run from place to place, lopping off orc heads as they go. It's pretty neat.<br/><br/>Is this a movie for kids, though? It's based on a kids-like book that's much lighter than the LOTR stuff to follow. And it is PG-13, of course. But it's not a family film in the sense that, oh, The Polar Express is. It can be scary at times, and the 3D - well used - heightens that. The dwarfs are great comic relief, but they don't dull the edge of a quick- paced, very well shot film. The youngest shouldn't be in the theater, but it's suitable for the tweens and above. With plenty of great action for the rest of us, too."

","This movie is bad. Really bad. About the only good thing I can say about it is that I am not being forced to watch it now. Oh, and Gollum was done reasonably well I suppose, as far as that goes. At least the changes made there didn't seem so destructive and pointless as to be an affront to intelligence.<br/><br/>Personally, having endured this mess, I am amazed anyone can find something here to enjoy. Fans of the book would seem unlikely to as it shares almost nothing with that story. Fans of good movies surely would take exception to the simple fact that it was ridiculous and boring. It is hard to take this farce seriously right from the opening shots which present Hobbiton on the day of Bilbo's birthday party from Lord of the Rings and then ramble on and on for fifteen or twenty minutes without even so much as trying to establish anything relevant or meaningful. Why start there? One must presume so that old LOTR cast members could be included and the running time could be stretched to the breaking point. Stretching seemed to be the main goal of the director since so much pointless and irrelevant material has been added to this film throughout. In the almost three hours I sat in the theatre I feel confident I saw an hour and a half of filler material meant to do nothing more than take up time.<br/><br/>Among the worst offenders in this area must be counted the fifteen minutes or so we spend watching stone giants fighting for no reason whatsoever. Does it have anything to do with the story? No, nothing at all. Is it interesting? No, not in the least. Does it take up time? Oh yeah, bunches, and it is CGI too, so there you go. However, this is nothing compared to the absurdity of Radagast the Brown who we get to watch for what seems like an hour dressed as some sort of homeless Santa Claus with poop in his hair (that is not a joke) riding in a sled pulled by magical bunny rabbits (sadly that is not either). These moments might be among the most ridiculous I have seen in a motion picture since Peter Jackson presented us with a Central Park ice skating monkey love scene in King Kong. I think this one may win though.<br/><br/>And yet this is just the start. Bad, plastic sets, outrageously juvenile humour, teleporting elves, and a Thorin Oakenshield apparently being played by Macgruber are only some of what else is wrong with this movie. There is even a fantastically awful sequence in which orcs pursue Radagast and his eight magic bunnies around and around in something straight out of Benny Hill. In every way imaginable, it is just really, really bad. Really."

I couldn't see any flaw in this movie at all, they do change the way some events happened, but they're details and don't really change the story, actually you can tell they were needed.Jackson also adds some information, but he did say beforehand that he would, and is taken from other Tolkien stories, and as I haven't read them, I was very happy with the change because they were things I didn't know. The way the movie starts is very clever, and the whole introduction before the journey is almost exactly like the book, which I enjoyed very much. The fights scenes, just exactly as LOTR are INCREDIBLE,very well done, and with some funny moments as well. The cast is flawless, I think every actor portrays their character to perfection, I was happy with all the acting choices. The part of the book they picked to end the movie was great, the book though is basically divided into three main events, so it was somewhat predictable, but the scene they made to end the movie was perfect!!. So Basically if you're a Tolkien fan, or just LOTR-Hobbit fan you'll be puking rainbows of epicness throughout the movie.I had the luck to go to the premiere, but i'm obviously gonna go watch it again on IMAX."

","When I first heard that Peter Jackson had decided to make ""The Hobbit"" into three movies I was rather surprised. ""The Hobbit"" is not a long or complex book. Just a simple story with some good characters and a good plot that moves along briskly. Unfortunately, the same thing cannot be said of the movie, the first of three. Jackson had four screenwriters, which may explain why this movie is such a muddle, and may also explain its inordinate length. I figure that after all the movies are made I'll be able read the book faster than watch all three movies. The movie is very slow moving, even many of the fight sequences. I fell asleep at one point and awoke dismayed that the movie still had an hour to go.<br/><br/>********* Spoilers********Spoilers*********Spoilers**************** The tedium of the movies was not its only problem. Apparently the quartet of writers think they are better writers than Tolkien. So many things were changed in the movie that it would take too long to enumerate them all. The worst was the treatment of Radagast the Brown, who was not even really in the book. Instead of making him a wizard of intelligence and power, he was portrayed as a buffoon in rags, complete with bird droppings all over his head. The only bright spots in the movie were Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Andy Serkis as Gollum. The scene where Bilbo acquires the ring of power is straight from the book and worth watching. Too bad I can't say the same for the rest of the movie."

","Saw The Hobbit last night and was very disappointed. Having read The Hobbit & LOTR in the 70's and re-read a couple of times since I really enjoyed LOTR because they were as true as possible to the books. In my opinion The Hobbit couldn't be further from the book. The book was written for children. Yes there's battle and violence in the book, but not on the scale of the movie. If anything the movie is darker than the three LOTR movies. The movie also take liberties with the story. I don't remember Thorin's grudge match with the head goblin. It just makes if more violent and darker. LOTR movie came out I looked forward to each new one. I have no desire to see the last two Hobbit movies, even when they're offered in the local library."

","This is not going to be one of those long reviews, consisting of detailed writings about what was good or wrong, that is for you to decide, once it hits the cinemas. All i am saying to you, is that you should definitely find some time and read the book before you go and see the movie. Book is very complex, sometimes hard to keep up with, but has a bit more ambient depth into it, while the movie offers you all the eye-candy that even your imagination wouldn't be able to conjure. The movie is pretty, well acted and has a good script, that sticks to what was in the book, BUT, much less detailed (well, it is a movie, so that's normal). This movie is not enough to understand everything behind The Hobbit and the story behind it, but it does give a nice illustrative try to simplify things."

","The Lord of the Rings trilogy has always been heavy reading, a very somber story. But The Hobbit is much lighter reading and quite humorous. Consequently, when I saw the movie, I thought I was watching an extension of the LOTR movies. Yes, it had a few humorous scenes, but the overall feel of the movie was heavy and somber. And I don't remember Radagast having bird dung running down the side of his head in the book. I also felt that the over-the-top gross depiction of the orc king was not in keeping with the book. I think that Mr. Jackson missed the mark with this movie. The book was ""fun"", for me the movie wasn't. I am so disappointed in this movie, I probably will not purchase it when it comes out in video."
"Theo Robertson","7","118","224","19 December 2012"," Familiarity Breeds Contempt
","I absolutely adored LORD OF THE RINGS especially the first film Fellowship Of The Ring and when it was announced THE HOBBIT was going to be turned in to a film I looked forward . Part of the reason I enjoyed LOTR is probably down to the fact I'd never read Tolkien . One point that did cause slight reservations for me is that people who had read THE HOBBIT commentated that there wasn't enough material there for a film trilogy . When the An Unexpected Journey was ready for release it was announced that its running time came to 168 minutes . Added to this director Peter Jackson seemed to have a problem with narrative drive in KING KONG and this got minor alarm bells running in my head . Was this going to be an overblown , overlong fiasco ?<br/><br/>First of all the good thing is that if you enjoyed LORD OF THE RINGS you will enjoy An Unexpected Journey I don't know if it's special effects but the fine cast who featured in the original trilogy namely Mckellen, Lee , Blanchett, Weaving , Holm and Wood don't look a day older than they did a decade ago . Likewise there's a wonderful internal continuity in that Fellowship had a Dwarf with a Welsh accent and there's a continuing Celtic connection with the casting of actors with a Northern British accents and my heart bursts with jingoistic pride watching a movie that is unashamedly Anglophile . As you might expect the cast are superb and for for a fantasy film everyone plays their roles with conviction . Even Sylvester McCoy the worst actor to have played the eponymous DOCTOR WHO has a screen presence something I thought I would never see<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that I have seen it . I saw it in 2001 when it was called Fellowship Of The Ring , saw it again in 2002 when it was called The Two Towers and saw it again in 2003 when it was Return Of The King and now I'm watching it again when it's called An Unexpected Journey . Can you see the point I'm making ? The story is structured and plays out exactly like the original trilogy . As in the opening sequence features a bloody battle with voice over , cuts to the Shire where Bilbo , Frodo and Gandalf meet , a fellowship is formed to go on a quest and the fellowship walks across a beautiful landscape filmed in New Zealand . Walking through a forest "" Oh we're being attacked "" . More walking along a mountain "" oh we're being attacked . Walking in to Rivendale . Walking out of Rivendale . Walking along some hills "" Oh we're being attacked "" . Walking .... you've got the idea haven't you ? One wonders how Peter Jackson thought this was a three hour film because to be brutal there's zero character and plot development and could easily have been told in two hours. There's also a slight lack of freshness and wow factor involved <br/><br/>I did enjoy the film but some of my enjoyment was spoiled by the fact I spent the last hour of it dying for a toilet break . If I was charitable I might have awarded it a higher mark but loses one point for being slightly overlong and loses another point that I sometimes had a seen it all before ten years earlier feeling . If Jackson had produced THE HOBBIT as a three hour epic instead of three films I'd have given him ten out of ten . I've got a feeling that cynicism will creep in to the franchise and Jackson won't be bombarded with the critical acclaim he rightly deserved for LORD OF THE RINGS . It's certainly isn't THE PHANTOM MENACE but I might just wait for the DVD for the next movie instead of seeing it at the cinema . BTW there's no need to have shot it on 3-D either because I watched it in 2-D and that's the format it feels naturally suited for . I guess 3-D is another money making excercise same as stringing a film in to a trilogy ?"

","Okay, I'm a big fan of the LOTR franchise. I was eagerly awaiting this movie and looking forward to seeing it. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I found it a colossal disappointment in multiple areas.<br/><br/>How does it look? The IMAX HFR 3D at 48fps (which has had mixed reviews some saying it's great and brings a new dimension and others said it makes the film look amateur and fake) in my opinion is a grave error and turns the movie into an amateurish looking farce in places. The slick action from previous films is gone with this higher detail and resolution of movement creating the placeholder for a very fake looking movie. The use of CGI is also excessive and the fine detail really shows you that it's computer generated and in no way believable. I'm not saying the CGI looks bad, I'm saying that the detail of the CGI due to the 48fps playback really makes it stand out from the actors which spoils it completely for me. There is a LOT of work to do if this is to become the norm for future releases.<br/><br/>Storyline? Another huge disappointment. The start of the film is extremely slow and the plot is pretty much laid out in full. Bunch of dwarfs and a hobbit take a trip to the old dwarf kingdom to fight a dragon that's sleeping there. No suspense, no guesswork, no excitement. I can pretty much imagine what part 2 will be like. I hope i'm wrong.<br/><br/>Characters? CGI mountain trolls and orc king that speak perfect English and engage in friendly fun banter, what on earth was the director thinking? So what spoils it? Poor CGI which doesn't work with the higher frame rate which means you can spot the difference immediately.<br/><br/>48fps version is a colossal and unprecedented visual disaster and makes a lot of the movie look so amateur, cheap and fake. I just wanted to switch back to normal speed so I could enjoy and absorb what I was seeing. Felt like as others have commented, a soap opera or watching the filming of it. I had no sense of watching an epic movie.<br/><br/>Misplaced comedy. Talking mountain trolls and a talking orc king all making them look totally fake. I expect these creatures to be fearsome abominations. Instead they are over-sized clearly computer generated clumsy comedians. These massive obviously intelligent mountain trolls are defeated by a few dwarfs with catapults. Seriously? Disappointment aside, I am looking forward in anticipation to the next installment."

WHY the HECK do Hollywood re-writers think they can improve on what the author did... I'll never get.<br/><br/>So much was added to tie it into the already made LOTR that it was sad.<br/><br/>They added lots to the intro. They played around with the personalities of characters.

"MosHr","10","280","562","11 December 2012"," Simply amazing! Manages to be even better than the Lord of the Rings
","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" takes us back to middle earth and this trip back is even better than what I remember of it. The scenes and locations are more detailed and nuanced, the characters presented with more depth and subtlety and the action more frenetic and grander. The movie is an amazing technical as well artistic achievement in all aspects and absolutely a must see movie.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" book is a simpler and shorter story than ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Being stretched out into three movies was expected to make it less epic and more mundane of a movie but that is absolutely not the case. Through sheer skill and artistry of movie storytelling, the plot feels absolutely epic and grand. While perhaps there is less at stake on middle earth than in ""Lord of the Rings"", there are more dimensions to the characters: doubt, guilt, frailty and a little extra space for humor and wit, which all paints a more colorful story.<br/><br/>At every turn, middle earth brims with overflowing wonder, magic and excitement. The technical wizardry and artistry to create the breath-taking visuals and actions are indescribably amazing and everything is given an extra little more than last time around for us to soak in the intricate details and designs. The dwarf city inside the mountain with its blustering industriousness and craftsmanship, the serene Rivendale, the rickety goblin kingdom all are presented with so much more substance and detail that even though they resemble previous ""Lord of the Rings"" set-pieces, they feel completely new and refreshing. The technical prowess and skills of the visual effects department have gotten so much better and that indescribable feeling of awe I felt we had when I first experienced ""Lord of the Rings"" set pieces like Moria and Gondor is still evoked watching these new set pieces. Plus, they have also vastly improved their handling of differences in heights of the characters and the interactions feel more natural and fluid. Everything feels like it has multiple layers and depth: from Bilbo's house and pantry to the dwarf and goblin kingdoms to all the skirmishes and battles. Middle earth as is presented here is as close to the perfect fantasy backdrop as it gets.<br/><br/>The new cast seamlessly blend into the middle earth world. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage as Thorin make the characters their own. Freeman's initial bumbling English demeanor and then the growth to an adventurer is skillfully done. Armitage wonderfully projects royalty and authority while still being constrained of being a dwarf. Ian McKellen's return as the wizard Gandalf is a more playful and comedic return while Andy Serkis's Gollum is more vicious and expressive than I remember him to be (this possibly is also due to some animation improvements in Gollum as well). The rest of the dwarf company are too many to keep track of individually but as a group they provide for the expected dwarfian physical humor but also the gravity when needed of a people who have lost their home. This generation of middle earthians are all around as wonderful a group to get to know as the generation from the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is simply amazing and is one the best movies ever made. With great storytelling, amazing visuals and very skillful acting, the movie grips you in a multiple of levels and never lets go. It is a movie to be seen as soon as humanly possible."
"SylvesterFox007","1","161","315","17 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Disappointment
","About a decade ago, Peter Jackson concluded his film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and swept the awards with ""The Return of the King"". Since then, Jackson has only had a couple of directing gigs, including his lackluster remake of the classic ""King Kong."" And only one piece of the LOTR saga remains for him to tap into. Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit"" isn't just a prequel chronologically. Tolkien actually wrote and published it almost twenty years before what would be considered the first book of the LOTR trilogy. While the books in the trilogy were epic fantasies that dug deep into the lore, the prequel was a light-hearted romp, a first footstep into a Middle Earth still taking shape in Tolkien's imagination. It was also a short romp, only a fraction of the length of any of the sequels. So, while fans clamored for the Extended Cuts of Jackson's original trilogy a decade ago, eating up the scenes that couldn't make it into the three-hour theatrical cuts, there's not much excuse to turn ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy of its own.<br/><br/>The movie starts by bridging the gap between ""The Hobbit"" and LOTR by reintroducing Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo says he will now tell the story of his greatest adventure, and then spends several minutes relating the entire history of the dwarfs to the audience before finally picking up where Tolkien chose to start, ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."" (Since the book was in third-person, and the movie adds a first-person narrator, the line now seems a little pretentious.) And then, instead of diving into the story, Elijah Wood wastes a few minutes of screen time with a completely unnecessary cameo as Frodo. Only then do we finally get to meet the young Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, and reunite with Gandalf, played again by Ian McKellan.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman has a talent for being the everyday man who is always agitated by everyone around him, from Arthur Dent in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" to Watson in ""Sherlock."" And playing homebody Bilbo gives him a great opportunity to roll his eyes and look perplexed by the 12-dwarf army he finds himself surrounded by. We meet each dwarf as they barge, one at a time, through Bilbo's front door, and then insist on singing an uninspired musical number for about two minutes as they wash Bilbo's dishes. When it's not dwarfs, it's the McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, or Christopher Lee characters from Jacksons' earlier trilogy pushing Freeman's Hobbit to the background. Instead of showing the same reverence to the source material that made Jackson's earlier trilogy so successful, here he ignores Tolkien's main plot and instead pads the movie with a subplot involving Radagast the Brown, a character taken from elsewhere in Tolkien's writings who has no place in ""The Hobbit"", and a Necromancer, and another one involving an albino orc pursuing the dwarf leader, in order to give the new trilogy a central antagonist. Where the novel was all about Bilbo's surprising resourcefulness, more emphasis is placed on sword and axe clashes between the dwarfs and the orcs. <br/><br/>Also, most of the light-heartedness of the novel has been leached out in favor of making the movie feel more like an extension of the original trilogy. While the movie is brighter and more colorful then the previous films, this just has the surprising effect of making the movie feel like one of those sequels the original director palmed off to someone else after he lost interest in the franchise, even though Jackson is still at the helm. There are some weak attempts at humor, but rather than Tolkien's wit, the biggest laughs come from unintentional comedy from the terrible acting and writing (disappointing, since one of the co-writers this time is Guillermo del Toro, who's better than this) behind lines like ""After sickness, bad things happen"" or ""If there's a key, there's a door.""<br/><br/>Like the previous trilogy, most of the visuals are a cross between New Zealand landscapes and CGI special effects. Peter Jackson makes the same mistake he did with ""King Kong"", assuming the computer-heavy effects are as impressive now as they were the first time we saw them in LOTR. Even the rain is disappointingly animated, noticeably leaving all of the actor's faces completely dry. A scene involving the dwarfs running in single-file and decapitating goblins feels dull and hollow. There is one scene worth raving about, a riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum in a dark pit. Not only does Andy Serkis, through voice work and motion capture, remind us that he should have won an Academy Award for the role he's still great at, but the scene finally gives Martin Freeman a moment to shine. Considering they decided to tell the story through Bilbo's perspective, it's surprising that this is the one scene that really gives the title character a central role.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding like one of those snobs who always complains that the book is better, in the time it will take to watch what is sure to be a 9-hour trilogy, you could probably read Tolkien's entire book, and be much more entertained doing so."
"ensign-5","2","33","57","11 January 2013"," Disappointment with a capital D
","I was very disappointed by this movie and surprised by just how awful it was. I say this as someone who loves LOTR. <br/><br/>The sets, the explosions, the special effects in The Hobbit are all well done, but this is hardly surprising - with the budget Jackson had to work with and the experience he had from LOTR we would expect nothing less than the highest production values. However the things that made LOTR exceptional - character development, story, pace, chemistry between the actors - are all in very short supply in the hobbit. The movie lumbered along unsure of its focus and without any sense of depth or connection between the characters. <br/><br/>I suspect that Peter Jackson sensed the emptiness of the film and he tried to distract us with numerous battles. There were far too many of these scenes and since the character development was so poor after the first couple of battles I didn't much care what was going on. Adding to the sense of disconnection was the absurdity of the action scenes. The dwarfs endured numerous battles/rock slides/falls from great heights, etc and came through it all with barely a scratch. After a while, the movie started to feel like a roadrunner/coyote cartoon - very boring and predictable.<br/><br/>I watched all the special features that came with the LOTR DVD package and I remember being so impressed with Peter Jackson. He seemed to care so much about the story and he seemed so determined to 'get it right.' In 'The Hobbit' I didn't sense the same spirit of care. It felt like a cynical and formulaic cash grab - dress some people up in middle earth costumes, add in lots of pointless fighting and CGI eye candy and then sit back and count the money. <br/><br/>I know some people were impressed with Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo. He did OK I suppose given the thinness of the script, but his performance was nothing special. Even his scene with Gollum, which some people have raved about, was old news and far too predictable. It didn't tell us anything new and it was just a poor copy of similar scenes from LOTR.<br/><br/>Tolkien fan that I am, I won't be going to see the second instalment of the Hobbit. Next time I need a Middle Earth fix I will load up my blu-ray version of LOTR!"

","Often we are compelled to do something we wouldn't usually do due to a rush of emotion and indeed, writing my first film review is accompanied by sorrow, anger and disappointment. Sorrow, because I am sorry that I wasted 3 hours of my life; anger, as I feel one of my favourite books has been desecrated; and disappointment, that now this film exists no- one will be given the further opportunity to actually do this book justice.<br/><br/>It might be expected that this review would harp on that there is an unnecessary amount of padding, which is true, but not what I particularly want to comment on; in other reviews it has seemed to overshadow, what I believe, are other major issues this film has.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins left me feeling very bitter. After watching and very much enjoying BBC's fantastic series 'Sherlock' with Martin Freeman playing 'Dr. John Watson', I was very much shocked that he has done nothing short of copy and pasting this character into 'The Hobbit'. We are presented with a scatty, cliché spouting 'hero' with all the charisma of a schoolchild acting up for attention. In Sherlock he is able to bounce effectively off of the stolid Benedict Cumberbatch but in 'The Hobbit' he is a source of mild 'kookiness' that festoons the plot-line like a wacky tie on a businessman. It becomes very difficult to take the story very seriously.<br/><br/>In the dwarven camp we also have the other extreme. Much like the famous seven dwarfs there is Grumpy (Thorin) whose levels of grumpiness have reached titanic proportions, unfortunately to the extent that he just comes across as being a rude, nihilistic homunculus. I don't even believe that he wants to succeed in his quest because then he might not have anything to whine about. There are also the other dwarfs... actually this is harder than I thought because the remaining 12 dwarfs are just uncharacterised all-purpose plot drivers. I suppose I also remember Fatty (Bombur) who is amusing in the same way that a cat confusing its reflection in a mirror for another cat is amusing; you will laugh but you would not exactly pay money to see it.<br/><br/>My mother always told me ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"", so I will compliment Andy Serkis and certainly the team behind the rendering of Gollum for what was the only scene that I enjoyed. The exposition of Gollum treads very carefully and I believe successfully along the line between quirky and menacing that I think even excelled the character's appearance in 'The Lord of the Rings'. I feel that I was challenged whether to feel sorry for or be frightened of Gollum and though his time on screen was disgracefully ephemeral, I felt that I was drawn in.<br/><br/>It was very difficult to be drawn in by the rest of it. Bilbo, despite claiming to be a poor sword-smith, becomes remarkably fortunate in his blows against presumably trained fighters. Most of the cast get battered against rocks and fall down vast crevices with no injury. None of the scenarios the dwarfs find themselves in seem the slightest bit daunting as they appear to be completely invulnerable and there is no sense of fear or peril. The actors barely deign to care about being captured or being attacked. It feels as if Peter Jackson is not even trying to convince you that the antagonists might win. Tension is created by promising the audience that the heroes are in serious danger, characters that you sympathise with will meet an unjust end at the hands of evil. If their absurd fortune suggests they are blessed by the Hand of God I am given no reason to feel any emotion beyond abject apathy.<br/><br/>The problem that the film is left with is that there is no sense of an epic journey. The frequency of flashbacks and asides just renders the main storyline incoherent and seemingly secondary to the back story and appearances of characters from 'The Silmarillion'; I'm not sure which story they are really trying to tell. The film is entitled 'The Hobbit' yet it tries so desperately to avoid the actual plot as much as possible that it ends up looking like a montage of deleted scenes from 'Lord of the Rings' interspersed with tenuous dialogue.<br/><br/>I enjoy films that throw different plot strands together but I like them to make some sense at the end of the film. It's like a puzzle where finally the picture reveals itself as all the pieces have been slotted together. I already knew the plot of 'The Hobbit' and I felt that I had my puzzle set up, ready to be admired, before Peter Jackson cast his hand carelessly across it and knocked all the pieces into a mess on the floor."
"neigenoirejz","1","24","40","9 May 2013"," A colorful action adventure mostly for children
","Despite many deviation from the books, I enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (especially the first movie). Sure, Peter Jackson did cut and (unfortunately) add in a lot of stuff that wasn't in the books and many things were portrayed inadequately, but in the end the cinematic brilliance of the movies won me over.<br/><br/>This time, however, I just couldn't force myself to enjoy the film. Here is a list of things that I personally found to be its biggest problems.<br/><br/>1. CGI. Too much is too much. The excessive reliance on computer generated graphics cheapens the experience and distances the viewer from the characters. Many scenes look like taken out of a video game cut-scene. Some characters like Azog are completely CGI! In addition to excessive amounts of CGI, the movie has a lot of action scenes with crazy camera movements (impossible to attain with actual cameras) which again contributes to the ""video game"" effect.<br/><br/>2. Borrowed LOTR concepts. The structure of this movie is very similar to FOTR. It starts with a backstory, telling historical events concerning the plot - just like in LOTR. Then a ""fellowship"" is formed who travel around visiting elves, climbing mountains (avoiding an avalanche of rocks/snow), fighting through underground tunnels (goblin town/Moria).<br/><br/>There's even a council involved and we see many characters of LOTR that weren't even mentioned in the book. Was the appealing to the LOTR crowd really necessary? What does it add to the story of the dwarfs? The Hobbit was written from Bilbo's perspective but the movie is trying much too hard to be a grand, epic story in the same vein as LOTR while retaining the children's tale aspect. It's unbalanced and simply does not work.<br/><br/>3. A lot of the comedy I found to be very poor. Remembering the funny moments in LOTR, I can't help but wonder what happened to Jackson's sense of humour. Of course, a lot of the humour in LOTR was based around Gimli, of which I was a little upset because in the books dwarfs are anything but comical. Nonetheless, I found myself genuinely laughing at the scene of Gimli talking about dwarf women to Eowyn, the scene with hobbits sparring with Boromir and attacking him jokingly, the scene with one of the hobbits asking ""So where are we going?"" at the Council of Elrond, the scene at the party with Frodo throwing Sam into dance with Rosie and the one with Frodo asking Gandalf: ""Mordor, Gandalf! Is it left or right?"", I could go on and on... All these moments and many, many others still make me smile. And what do we get in The Hobbit? Trolls sneezing on Bilbo and him warning the trolls not to eat the dwarfs, because they have worms? Really?<br/><br/>The big problem here, I guess, is that Jackson decided to continue the LOTR trend of portraying dwarfs as clumsy, comical people. And since dwarfs take up much of the screen time of The Hobbit, it's unsurprising that it turned out having this weird, supposedly comical undertone throughout. To me it blunts all the seriousness of the story and destroys any tension or dramatic elements. Which brings us to the next point.<br/><br/>4. Lack of suspense. I expected this movie to feel much like FOTR did - a tense, suspense-filled adventure. Unfortunately this turned out not to be the case. There is a lot of action in the Hobbit. So much that at one point it becomes dull and meaningless. The dwarfs and the hobbit survive the craziest of situations, always surviving/being saved at the last moment. Fall from 500 feet on a wooden platform? No problem - everyone's safe and sound. Get caught in the midst of a fight between two gigantic transformer-rock-monsters? Don't you worry, our heroes will get through without as much as a scratch. Ridiculous! I don't think I recall any scenes in LOTR that felt so over the top. (Well, maybe with the exception of Legolas killing the mumakil.) Just remember the ending of FOTR and compare it to the ending of The Hobbit. Completely different worlds in terms of suspense.<br/><br/>5. The pace. Stretching the thin novel over 3 films - each roughly 3 hours long is probably the root of all the problems. Imagine what a wreck it would have been if FOTR was stretched over 3 films? That's exactly what we're witnessing here. The movie is filled with dull action and LOTR homages to fill the screen time of a 9 hour journey that should never have been 9 hours. It should have been a single movie. Initially Peter Jackson was asked to do a single movie for LOTR, but he refused stating that he couldn't make it and do the books any justice. Then for a period he was prepared to make it into two movies! Yes, the entire LOTR - into just two movies. And what on earth possessed him to stretch this 300 page book into 9 hour cinema? I wish I knew the answer to this question...<br/><br/>When the Hobbit was first announced I was thrilled, I knew that if Peter Jackson directed it, the movie would be brilliant. When I heard it would be 3 movies, a shadow of doubt crept into me. Sadly, this movie became everything I hoped it wouldn't. I give it 2 out of 10 for the scene with Gollum, the beautiful sets and design. Most of the rest of the movie was disappointing.<br/><br/>Christopher Tolkien's words come to mind: ""The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away."""

You know there's a problem with the entire audience is happy to see Gollum--and he elicits the most empathy! <br/><br/>Really, this was inexcusably bad, from the dwarf makeup that looked like early Star Trek prosthetics, to the boring effects, to them slowly traipsing through New Zealand which we saw three times before.<br/><br/>This was about nothing. Bilbo should be the center of the movie, right, but he wasn't. You didn't get to know him or care. He goes from freaking out because the dwarfs are using his dishes, to the next morning waking up and wanting to go with them-- with NO hint of why his character would make such a huge shift. <br/><br/>It doesn't matter how much CGI you have, if you don't have people to root for, you simply don't care and all those battles are boring! Compare this with ""Life of Pi"" where the CGI was totally in service of the characters, where you cares about the boy--and even the tiger! <br/><br/>There was NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE.

","Martin Freeman plays young Bilbo Baggins who's been given the role of Burglar in a quest to reclaim some hill once exploited by The Dwarfs that since long has been domiciled by a nasty dragon named Smaug. Bilbo wants no part of it but, without any motivation given, teams up anyway. The head scratching begins.<br/><br/>Not discussing the technical merits, the film is a complete disaster from beginning to end. Every bit of dialog is puerile, fake and contrived, not to mention progressing in the most clumsy, dragged out fashion imaginable. The incoherent plot lines lack any focus and there is no character development to compensate for it. Every scene is a copy of another scene that was copied from pick-your-installment of Lord of the Rings in which it was already a copy of some earlier scene. Every climax in those scenes ends with a deus ex machina subterfuge allowing our heroes to get away unharmed, no matter how ridiculous or insulting to the genre formerly known as Fantasy.<br/><br/>The film is simply a vehicle showcasing the technical improvements in CGI, 3D and recording techniques (the doubled frame rate) which oddly enough makes the actual picture seem completely unconvincing. All I saw was a bunch of dressed up, overpaid actors rehashing the lines they memorized for the scenes they were in. The added realism which is brought about by the 'improvements' in recording, garners the complete opposite of what is aimed for. Everything seems detached from what should be a steady canvas onto which a story is painted. And that would include the completely needless cameos by Weaving, Blanchett and the warmed up corpse of 90 year old Christopher Lee who looked as if a CGI version of his character might have been the more humane option to go with.<br/><br/>The 8.6 this marathon of nonsense currently presents itself with on IMDb defeats the purpose of having a rating system at all. Check the 'hated it' review section for future references for any film. It's probably the last resort to find an honest critical analysis for your movies."

","I've read a lot of the reviews here and a lot of them have spot on information. So, I will keep this short and sweet:<br/><br/>It's terrible. Anyone who grew up reading the books and living in Tolkien's world would be simply astounded... at how badly they mangled this book into a movie. For all the people out there who have never read the books and only see the movies, I feel intense pity and empathy for you because the books and the world created by them are vastly more intense and fulfilling than any of the movies portray. It's like trying to show the whole universe with 1 small Polaroid picture.<br/><br/>The LOTR movies were all-in-all pretty good but The Hobbit (Part 1?) was a total disappointment.

Even though it was rather dark and brooding, it was actually very interesting in the fact that most of those kind of movies are not very good at all. I liked it also because of Martin Freeman who is one of my favorite British actors. It's special effects where god as well, with the battle scenes, and scenes with giant creatures and stuff. After watching at night was actually really cool because it was kinda scary as far as the ""What's right outside my door?"" theory due to the ogres and things.

"Pablox2","1","23","39","1 June 2013"," Leaves a dent in the LOTR legacy
","OK, to be fair this is not a 1/10 movie. But it is so far from being a 10/10 and a top 250 movie that I felt the need to make a point.<br/><br/>I can see that many of the reviewers who have given the movie a top score have not even seen the LOTR-trilogy. That is absurd. That would be like declaring ""Godfather III"" to be the best mafia movie ever without seeing the first two (which of course are FAR better). Or, perhaps more relevant, saying that ""The Phantom Menace"" is the best Star Wars-movie without having seen the others. You simply cannot judge ""The Hobbit"" without seeing in it the context of the LOTR-trilogy.<br/><br/>Sadly, ""The Hobbit""-trilogy is probably going to be far more costly and extravagant than the LOTR-trilogy was. What a pity that is, when you think of the material the two trilogies were meant to cover. In LOTR each movie covered a thick book. In the Hobbit, each movie covers a couple of chapters in a small book for children.<br/><br/>The book which is ""The Hobbit"" simply does not warrant a trilogy of films. It should have been a single movie and nothing more. The pace in the movie is agonizingly slow, and it is filled with so many time-passing action sequences and special effects that you almost feel like you are about to have a stroke at the end of the movie. Three hours is spent on what is an hours worth of material at the very most.<br/><br/>As for the casting, it is cool to see some of the old gang again. But you can tell that it has been over ten years since the last movie. Which of course is a bit odd considering that this movie is a prequel to the others. I personally can't stand Martin Freeman (Bilbo) with his perpetual and one-dimensional annoyed/dumbfounded facial expression, but I guess that is a matter of taste.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good. I wish they were available when they made LOTR. But even though something is good, there is a limit too how much you can stand of it. Maximum Overkill is how I would describe it in this case.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very disappointed in the movie, and I do not feel like seeing the next two.<br/><br/>For you guys who have not seen LOTR and rates this 10/10 - you are unforgivably ignorant.<br/><br/>For those who have seen LOTR and STILL rates this 10/10 - sacrilege is the word that comes to mind."

","Although The Hobbit was by far my favorite childhood book, Peter Jackson managed to turn it into the worst movie that I have ever seen. The movie was devoted only to the journey to the mountain, which did not need to be dragged out for three hours; rereading that portion of the book would have been faster than watching the movie. The Hobbit is a relatively short book compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, so there was no reason to split it into three movies.<br/><br/>Jackson left out the heart of the book, and instead got lost in the scenery and action scenes. If you're the type of person who likes picture books, then you'll love this movie. However, if you can actually read and are familiar with the elements of a story, then you'll feel like much was missing from this movie."

","This movie was really disappointing. Let me say that although I didn't read the LOTR books, I loved the movies. However, I did read The Hobbit. Just got back from the theaters a few hours ago so I've had a few hours to think about what I liked and didn't like. First off, one hour into the movie I found myself getting sleepy and closing my eyes for a few minutes (I have never done that). I thought, ""maybe Im just exhausted from Christmas"" but after the movie my Mom, cousins and uncle all said they did the same thing! We actually got a little laugh about it as it was the only reason we could find to smile after seeing the movie. It just took too long for ""the adventure"" to get started, and there was little reason to understand WHY Bilbo changed his mind and decided to go! Second, Im done with IMAX,3D movies that are set in dark locations like this movie. Its physically too hard to follow the action and I find myself exhausted trying to keep up with ""whos getting killed"" or ""who lived"". Speaking of getting killed, NOBODY DID! About half way through the adventure it just started to get ridiculous how these puny dwarfs were surviving everything they were going through. I know its a fantasy movie, but gimmie a break! By the end I knew everyone was going to live through everything, making the battle scenes very boring. Bilbo had to be the most disappointing character in this movie. The book was written through his eyes and it made you sympathize with his struggles. I had ZERO sympathy for Bilbo! I almost feel guilty saying that as I almost cried watching the cartoon when I was a kid! Lastly,(and I might be the only person who didn't know this going in) when the movie ended I got a real sickening felling deep inside. The Hobbit was ONE short book! Why are they trying to make it into 3 very long movies!! All of a sudden I realized I had been duped. Duped into a typical Hollywood money-grab riding on the coat-tails of LOTR. At that point I realized why this movie was so bad. Its just trying to be something it is not. If this movie was made as a one movie blockbuster it would have been great. John Carter could have done the same thing but instead, the writers put all the books into one movie and it turned out great. This is the exact opposite. Parts 2 and 3 of this story will be seen by me at the dollar theater. If your a die-hard fan and find that you ""must"" see this at the theater, that is my advice to you as well."

There is some good to be said about this movie: Many set-designs and landscape shots are quite beautiful (in case you missed the same set-designs and landscape shots in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy)... Alas, this does not a great movie make! In terms of plotting, pacing or character development ""The Hobbit"" falls unbelievably short. Actually this movie is like watching six or eight fantasy video game trailers in sequence. Jackson put much effort in creating 3D-worthy graphics but none in a story worthy to be told. The additions to Tolkien's Book feel contrived and unnecessary, bordering on ridiculous.<br/><br/>The movies action has neither point nor focus. Especially (but not exclusively) the battle scenes feel drawn out and overlong. During the screening I saw, two people in my row actually fell asleep during the movie, proving that action for it's own sake is simply... tiring.<br/><br/>Jacksons interpretation of The Lord Of The Rings was partly faithful as well as partly very far from the original source. Either way, one had the impression, that Jackson was driven to tell (his version of) this story. With The Hobbit, you get the expression that Jackson's only drive is to cash in. A pity.<br/><br/>I won't say, that I'll avoid the coming parts two and three - I'll definitely wait for the budget DVD/Blu-Ray though."

A basically faithful-to-the-book rendition for old-fashioned types - like yours truly - who really only want its look and feel translated into visual format?<br/><br/>A lavish family-friendly epic for casual admirers of the Tolkien 'franchise', with enough easy reference points to this 'back material' for the new 'product entry' to fit seamlessly into the whole?<br/><br/>A 3-D Wide-Screen Tom-and-Jerry-cartoon-writ-large for the Video Game Generation, not overly concerned with plot, character, dialogue, coherence, dramatic tension, authenticity, or any other damn thing save 'awesome' special effects and bespoke cartoon violence?<br/><br/>The sad answer: a mishmash of all the above. This handsome looking, unevenly paced, garishly sensationalist dog's dinner is much more of a nightmare than a dream come true for any real lover of Tolkien. Even those of them, such as me, who liked the LOTR films.<br/><br/>Received wisdom has made us aware of the book's supposed shortcomings for modern adaptation. But has the hectic beefing-up of story, action scenes, back plot, character arcs/motivations etc. made things any better? Quite the reverse. Excessive tinkering has actually only served to show how well engineered the book was/is.<br/><br/>To be scrupulously fair, there are still some traces of wit, beauty, a sense of wonder, not completely trampled into the mud. But enough of the structure and (crucially) feel of the book is annihilated, leaving an admirer of the original feeling depressed, angry and manipulated. And this syndrome unfortunately gets ever worse as the film progresses, meaning that, despite the occasional good bits, the final impression when leaving the cinema is very negative indeed. <br/><br/>One senses a frantic, and toxic, combination of no-risk-taking combined with throwing-in-every-possible-kitchen-sink throughout. Any previously commercially successful star in the fantasy movie universe has to be referenced at all costs. Boyish knockabout slapstick; check ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". CGI superbeings slugging it out: check ""Transformers"". Simplistic racial conflict plot structure; check ""Avatar"". Generic quest narrative; check, er, ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>Examples of manipulation, all periodically evident throughout the film's entire run time, include: crude signposting of every plot twist; every being's inner feelings and motivations exaggerated and rammed home; every dangerous situation amplified beyond rhyme or reason into the completely absurd, thereby destroying rather than enhancing dramatic tension; totally generic 'stirring' fantasy soundtrack music unsubtly underpinning the action to further stupefy the senses.<br/><br/>Allotting specific blame on the director, or script writers, or producers, or backers of this pumped-up product for its artistic failure is futile. ALL the above, plus others, whatever their intentions at the outset, have combined in some unholy reverse alchemy to foist upon the world not a thing of beauty to be cherished forever (like the book), but rather a tasteless assault course for the senses, a crass base-metal reinvention of a golden literary creation.<br/><br/>And – no, please, no – we're still only a third of the way through!<br/><br/>Thoughtful fans of Tolkien, beware. Do not trust the positive reactions to this artefact from the sensation addicts who are evidently blinded by their dependence on cheap thrills. I don't care how depressingly numerous they are!

","My background is mixed: I loved LOTR and thought it was an exemplary execution of the epic journey genre. I am also a video engineer in L.A., and hated The Hobbit in its book form. The Hobbit comes across as a pale clone and completely unnecessary movie that follow's in LOTR's steps. I saw it essentially as a professional duty to go and see it in 48fps. The impact on us filmmakers is major and the Hobbit's importance in that regard is unquestionable. I have the eye to spot different frame rate all the time, and think that 120MHz TV's and ""fluid motion"" features are the worst thing that has ever happened to home theater. Nevertheless 24fps is constricting to filmmakers and I was looking forward to see what 48fps could bring. <br/><br/>The difference was obvious from the second the WB logo came up. Despite my 3 hours of genuine attempts to enjoy the movie, I couldn't. The action seemed horrifyingly sped up at times as if the projector was malfunctioning, and everything had a cheap, unmagical feel to it, no matter how exquisite the lighting, camera work, and production design were. This was the key - unmagical - in the kind of movie that needs it like no other. HFR might work for other genres or dramas that call for more realism, but it fell completely flat for this fantasy epic. I'm able to separate resolution from frame rate so the movie didn't seem ""clearer"" to me at all - and I was trying to NOT look for detail but enjoy the story as a whole. This, though, might also have to do with the fact that we probably watched the movie in 2K, on a non-huge screen in a Chicago suburb.<br/><br/>I read The Hobbit a decade ago when I was in the military and posted in the middle of the desert for a week. I didn't remember the plot, but to this day I remember how boring it was for such a short and renown book. It was all worsened by the decision to inflate it into 3 double-length movies. Every plot point is utterly mundane, non-dramatic, and cliché, and they're all stretched to the max. 400 reviewers have already given plenty of examples for that.<br/><br/>To my personal dismay, the 7 relatives I saw the movie with had no qualms with the frame rate and they all loved the movie. Oh well, I'm allowed my one vote."

","What the hell is this? <br/><br/>I've been looking forward to this for a long time now and last night I got the chance to see it, and was really excited. The Hobbit is a great story, albeit a short one, and its strength is in the warmth, courage and resilience of the characters. Bilbo Baggins is an everyman, who has been swept up in a dangerous adventure and has to grow and develop in order to deal with the situations he finds himself in. We can identify with him on some level, and sympathise with him when he feels lost and alone in the company of strangers. His story should resonate with us all.<br/><br/>What we get, however, is a crude and vulgar retelling of that story, complete with embellishments and fabrications, fart jokes and knob gags. Yes, a knob gag in a Tolkien film. That was almost enough to make we leave in itself, but I stuck it out to see if this was a one off, something to keep the adults laughing while the kids watched. But, alas, the entire movie was riddled with base humour and redundant characterisations. The dwarfs were ancillary characters (at best), with Bilbo only getting to take the lead between convoluted battle scenes, none of which I remember from the book, and even when he did take centre is was only to further the plot a little until the next MacGuffin could be inserted to facilitate yet another tedious battle scene, complete with entirely made up characters.<br/><br/>I don't know what this piece of crap thinks it is, but it is not The Hobbit."
"billygoat1071","9","40","75","14 December 2012"," A Tremendous Introduction
","The Lord of the Rings has been a timeless epic classic that is hard for other fantasy, Tolkien wannabe movies to capture its magic and so far, director Peter Jackson is probably the only one who can capture it. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of a split trilogy of its prequel. Though, J.R.R. Tolkien's book is not really that long for a split and the film is even a lot longer as the story's introduction. The result of the movie is it's rather too long and a bit slow but the experience is still worth it. With its spectacular visuals and grand scale, it's all pretty exciting. Despite of its stretch, the film's genuinely unique enjoyment made this easily one of the best blockbusters of the year.<br/><br/>As it is said, it's too long for an introduction of the shortest Lord of the Rings story, but no matter what you think about the runtime you'll still get to enjoy it. The magic of the last series is still there. The only difference is the pacing and it has a lot of flashbacks but there's no denying that every scene of the film is entertaining. The film has some goofy moments with the dwarfs that are quite delightful and amusing. When it comes to the action, it's has the thrills and excitement that we don't usually get in most blockbusters these days. The performances are remarkable as always. Martin Freeman makes a charming young Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and still got it. Richard Armitage is filled with vulnerability and gravity as Thorin. Ken Stott and James Nesbitt gave their characters some wonderful personalities.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson returns giving this the same epic tone and heart of the original trilogy. It's best when there's a genuine fortitude in the large suspenseful sequences. The visuals just got more stunning and eye candy. The CGI effects are exceptionally gorgeous. Same goes to the cinematography that made every landscape in Middle Earth look so magnificent. It's always been like that but with higher quality(and High Frame Rate) it's never been this marvelous. The music score is quite excellent, seems like it's going to be a new classic theme music.<br/><br/>The ending of the film would definitely excite many for the next part. The film's scale made this such a satisfying cinematic experience. Fans of the series will definitely love it if they didn't bother about the runtime. Even newcomers might get fascinated. The trilogy split is still unnecessary. Ending up making this introduction pretty humongous, but that's what's awesome about this film. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey may be too long but it's still worth it by its amazing filmmaking and fun adventures."
"tpaladino","4","31","57","13 October 2013"," Hobbit: The Phantom Menace
","Okay, so it's not quite as awful as The Phantom Menace was, but it comes damn close to damaging the LOTR franchise in the same way TPM did to the Star Wars franchise.<br/><br/>Let's review here:<br/><br/>1. The story is damaged within the first ten minutes and never recovers at any point in the film. The fact is, simply, that Bilbo's character is never developed. We have no freaking idea why Gandalf chose him or why he's so important. We're given no reason to really care about him, and therefore it makes zero sense why any of the other characters should care about him either. The entire film suffers for this, because Bilbo is, essentially, the lead. And when you don't care about the lead, you pretty much don't care about anything else. <br/><br/>2. The tone is WAY off. Yes, The Hobbit was a children's book. However, the film needs to fit into the already-established LOTR universe, and it struggles to do so. The first half is filled with bizarre slapstick and childish humor more akin to Sesame Street than a LOTR film, while the second half attempts to take a drastic turn for the dark, making everything seem completely disjointed. It just didn't work.<br/><br/>3. CGI disasters. Yep, Peter Jackson seems to have taken a page from the George Lucas 'How To Ruin A Beloved Franchise' playbook, and leaned WAY too hard on CGI for this film. I know there was quite a bit of CGI in the original films, but it was truly abused in this one. Far too many characters were pure CGI creations, and way too many scenes were set entirely on a green screen. CGI is best when its working in support of practical sets and effects, not when it's the only effect being used. Jackson struck a near-perfect balance in LOTR, but The Hobbit just seemed like one big cartoon most of the time. Bad. And made even worse by the fact that we already know what Jackson and his production team are capable of. <br/><br/>4. HFR is as bad, if not worse, than everyone says. Shooting this film in HFR was probably the single worst decision anyone could have made. Everything looks cheap and plastic. You can see the seams on the actors prosthetics, you can tell that the sets are cardboard, and the already-problematic use of CGI is exacerbated tenfold. HFR takes the magic out of films. Period. <br/><br/>5. No attractive, human protagonists. This may sound superficial, but the fact is that without a strong lead that people can relate to, your film is likely going to fail. Especially in a film that is filled with monsters and weird creatures and other oddities. It's really hard for people to empathize with characters that they either aren't attracted to or can't relate to on some basic level. Nobody wants to be a dwarf or a hobbit. LOTR had several strong, attractive human leads, both male and female. And yes, Frodo and Sam were indeed beloved characters, but they were brilliantly written and developed in a way that neither Bilbo nor any of the dwarfs were in The Hobbit. As such, the audience simply cannot emotionally attach itself to anyone in this film. <br/><br/>6. Completely impossible scenarios that don't even make sense within its own universe. This is a big one and it drives directly to the cartoonish nature of the film. There are several scenes, most notably during the escape from the Goblin kingdom, where the characters are put through a series of actions that are laughably absurd. Now, this is a movie and not real life, and nobody expects perfect physics. But everything still needs to work within its own universe, and the fact is that some of these stunts are just dumb and insulting. You'd never have seen this kind of nonsense in the LOTR trilogy, and this film should follow the same rules. Quite frankly some of the action scenes could have been cut out altogether and the film would have been better off for it. <br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>A great scene between Gollum and Bilbo is very much worth watching. Highlight of the entire movie, and almost makes the rest of the nonsense worthwhile."

","I was a little sceptical going in as to how they could milk a 300 page book into three films (and long films too, dear God, this was long!). I'd read the book not too long ago, the first time since childhood, and I remembered it pretty distinctly and I have to say that Peter Jackson did an excellent job of filming every single last word of the first 5 chapters, and then some!<br/><br/>I felt it was a 2 star film because of the visuals, the scenery is stunning as always but the crisp, clean production rather than putting me into the action (I heard Peter Jackson interviewed and this is what he was going for) it just pulled me out of the film when spotting thee glaringly obvious cuts between actors and cartoon. The visuals were so clear and concise, to the point of really showing some bad CGI at points. I hate when the characters switch and you notice the switch between actors and cartoon, sorry CGI. But they did look cartoony. I didn't think that it should have looked like it was made by the Scy-Fy channel.<br/><br/>If he had a problem with the editing process, he should have slung it my way. 20mins for washing up is not needed. In the book, this time is used to introduce the characters but in the film they didn't do that, they just washed up and sang songs. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was not the film I paid to see.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman was brilliant. As was Andy Serkis. Gollum and Bilbo saved the film for me. That scene was the best thing about the whole film. It is a bad sign when I'm thinking of how long I've still got to go with a film when we're about 30 mins in!<br/><br/>I can't sit in a cinema for the other two films, I will need to see them on Sky or Blu-Ray. I just couldn't do it again. In my own home, when I can pause it and wander around to wake up my bum again is the way to go, I think."
"duckmushroom","4","37","70","28 December 2012"," Why ""an Unexpected Journey"" missed the point.
","The main problem with The Hobbit, as far as I can see it, is that it strays so ridiculously far from the original. Now, I'm not one of those nerdy puritans who thinks that the book The Hobbit resembles something sacrosanct like the Koran or the Bible, but the point is that the book holds a lot of beauty, intelligence and intrigue - the point is that Jackson and crew have completely missed the point.<br/><br/>It's clear from the outset that Jackson/Hollywood/whoever wanted to string what is in reality a simple tale into a three-part money-spinner. Okay. If they'd kept more closely to the original and added extra adventures in-between it may have served. But instead they've brushed over the entire meat of the story and twisted it until it resembles only in bones the original, and I think that's a shame, because the opportunity was there to bring the beauty of the book to life.<br/><br/>Let us take, for example, the beginning, when the dwarfs arrive at Bag End believing that Bilbo is a burglar. In the book it is his inability to be impolite, followed by his desire to live up to good things that others have said about him that drives him to continue the charade of being a burglar - and the dwarfs DO believe he is a burglar for the entire journey. This is integral to the story, yet in the Hollywood version, Bilbo has a Hollywood style tantrum that the dwarfs magically ignore, the whole script comes back to ""I'M NOT A BURGLAR! I'M NOT A BURGLAR! I'M NOT A BURGLAR!"" repeatedly, into the bargain they've written in an enmity between Thorin and Bilbo that doesn't exist, and Bilbo at some point in the film tries to slink off (going entirely against his faithful nature which is core to the reason Gandalf selects him) - all of these ill-thought out gaffs and many more we don't have time to go into serve to lose the identity of Bilbo and flatten the story into two-dimensions.<br/><br/>For a film they've labelled ""An Unexpected Journey"" they sure brushed over the journey aspect of it. Maybe the idea that the weather was bad and they run out of food quite early on doesn't seem like box-office gold to the makers, but maybe also they underestimate the general public and like I've said before, something more beautiful and timeless could have been made from this story. Instead they've invented aggressive bad-guys to pursue and turned every episode of the adventure into a battle, again missing the point, as it is Bilbo who, despite being timid and unsure of himself, does the right and clever thing and saves them each time. Again, it is a Hollywood preoccupation with violence that ruins what could have been a classic movie.<br/><br/>As to the battle scenes, they're not even well done. We have a modern state where we can produce on computer almost any image, and the culture is to try and make films visually more and more extreme. But 50 giant wargs charging violently and super-fast at 13 dwarfs and a hobbit looks absolutely ridiculous when not a single member of the troupe is harmed. This over-playing of CGI battles occurs again and again, and completely destroys any feelings of suspense we may have had during the battle. If, for example, they'd kept to the original story in the Goblin caves and the battle had been confined to completely dark tunnels, lit only by the eerie light of the swords Orcrist and Glamdring, with the horde of Goblins pursuing heavily but fearing the swords, that would have made for great suspense. As it is the troupe take on, unconvincingly, hundreds and hundreds of goblins in a basically open space. This OTT CGI completely guts the film of any drama, with the gang on several occasions falling far further than it would be possible to survive (without a scratch), being under horrendous rockfalls with no adverse effects etc etc. The makers of this film really need to go back to film-school and learn about basic techniques pertaining to the suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>I could go on, about how the malevolence of the goblins is completely brushed over for example: the Great Goblin has more of an air of the late, great Sir Patrick Moore than an evil creature, but I'll leave my gripes now by stating that the errors integral to the story are manifold, and - quelle surprise - the motivations of the production company have pretty much ruined the story.<br/><br/>If I have harped on about the errors I have to say that the movie is not all bad, it has some humour, and its triumph is that it plays everything for laughs. Of course, the vast majority of movie-goers have never read the book, and don't care a whit about seeing a timeless classic on screen (in latter years they've had no opportunity, being content with largely trash). For these people I suppose the movie should be highly enjoyable, and for this reason I guess it is ranked so highly on IMDb.<br/><br/>Beyond that the scene with Gollum is great. Here they have taken the original story and brought it visually to life. If only they could have done the same with the rest of the movie. 4 out of 10 for all the visuals and humour that money can buy."

Devoid of its original humor and charm, and every character replaced with a one dimensional action movie caricature. He doesn't make minor changes to fit with a screenplay. Nope. He takes the setup for each scene in the book, and then re-writes it completely to suit his own taste, or possibly worse, what he thinks is his theater audience's taste, without any regard whatsoever to what Tolkien wrote.

","You can tell by my rating that I didn't like this movie, but let's be fair. Despite my overall negative view of it, I still found some gems which are so good that I just can't bring myself to not mention them.<br/><br/>The end credits song is better than all three end credit songs from ""The Lord of the Rings"" films; there are so many words you could describe it with: dignified, moving, haunting; I'll settle on ""powerful"". The opening battle scene was on par with the one in ""Fellowship"". The last shot was a masterpiece of quiet tension. The special effects are top notch...and that's really all the praise I can give it.<br/><br/>There are two ways to evaluate any book-to-film adaptation: either by comparing it to the source material or to see if it works on its own. Sadly, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" fails in both.<br/><br/>It fails in comparison to the book because the title character himself is nowhere to be found; instead we're stuck with an impostor. In the book, Bilbo Baggins is a timid, pitiful individual who takes part in something much bigger than he is and slowly grows from an ineffectual wreck of a man into a cunning, brave hero. MovieBilbo (as I will refer to the aforementioned impostor) opts for a different approach. Rather than being timid and anxious, MovieBilbo is merely flustered and annoyed. Rather than being ineffectual, MovieBilbo immediately becomes the most-competent member of Thorin's team. While both Bilbo and MovieBilbo had an arc, MovieBilbo both downplays it (by making him less pathetic at the beginning) and rushes it (by making him become competent much faster), and these two things ultimately make the character growth not only meaningless but almost unnoticeable.<br/><br/>Now, only the worst of obnoxious fanboys would evaluate a movie solely by how faithful it is to the source material, but even on its own, the movie fails. Why? Because it goes against one of the foundational rules of cinema: Show, Don't Tell.<br/><br/>Granted, there is, in fact, a lot of stuff this movie DOES show - the fall of Erebor, Thorin battling against Azog, and so on - but on the most crucial stuff, it opts for telling. The tension between Bilbo and Thorin is a driving force in the third act, but the only way it is indicated is through dialogue. Thorin tells Bilbo he doesn't fit in with the rest of the band. Bilbo himself makes this same observation later on. The problem is that these spoken lines are the only indication of this. With the exception of him having a little trouble riding a pony near the opening, Bilbo is not shown to be any less competent than the dwarfs. We, the audience, never see Bilbo struggle to keep up with Thorin's company. Rather, we're just spoon-fed it by the dialogue, and that just makes the tension, the conflict that follows, and the resolution to said conflict feel fake or artificial.<br/><br/>Either way you look at it (on its own or in the shadow of the book), the movie just doesn't let you emotionally invest in it's lead character. You might as well stick with the Rankin-Bass cartoon from the 70s, which - despite cramming the plot into about 90 minutes - is much more enjoyable and has a lead that you'll actually care about. If there's one good thing that could come out of Jackson's film, it would be bringing this other version out of (very undeserved) obscurity.<br/><br/>I don't know if the next movie will be better, but I do know that I probably won't bother seeing it."
"davidwmfc","4","70","142","18 December 2012"," Disappointing
","I really wanted to like this film but it was absolutely dreadful. The HFR issue is a complete red herring; it's just a really bad film.<br/><br/>The dwarfs were just 12 Jar Jar Binks equivalents, plus a poor man's Aragorn Gandalf was erratic rather than wise and just magicked away everything on his whim, showing up whenever he felt like it. The butterfly scene in Fellowship was excellent, using it again here is just a feeble get of of jail card.<br/><br/>So many gimmicks, I can understand wanting to add a bit of light heartedness to a stony franchise but it took the biscuit. Every single action or battle scene revolved around some slapstick element that made you cringe or just laugh at its pitifulness.<br/><br/>No pace, no real driving force behind Gandalf or Bilbo's characters. Freeman's Bilbo has one good scene in the whole movie. Apart from that he spends the film making The Office-style straight man faces, changing his mind about the quest every ten minutes with no real explanation or context.<br/><br/>The LOTR trilogy was good as it didn't rely on the source material at all, they were excellent stand alone films. With The Hobbit, the Tolkein fanboys are frantically turning through the browning pages of the novels to try and excuse the bad acting, flat characters and pointless scenes.<br/><br/>A really bad film.

","I watched this movie in 3D HFR. If you find 3D movies dim of light and a headache, you will not find any improvement in this new tech. In fact, the movie felt like a BBC TV show, losing all cinematic effect and rendering a very disappointing and largely unpleasant experience. I did recognize the expertise with which the cgi was made, where everything looked to be as natural (or unnatural), with only your logic to tell you what is real and what is not. The problem was that the outcome is quite unpleasant to watch... Too... Clean, and un-movie like. The only exception was the exquisite rendering of Gollum, it was a really impressive work on its facial expressions and body textures. Another annoyance is the split of the short story into two movies... Especially since the first 85 minutes are such a waste of time with zero plot/character development value (and as i said, an unpleasant visual experience). The soundtrack was also very poor and un-epic-ish, at many times, it felt like a low budget TV production. There was very little in this movie to demonstrate the technology improvement... Sometimes, new techniques diminish from the state of art. To summarize, the story telling was C-, the soundtrack D-, the CGI B+, the new 3D tech - F. Verdict: watch if you have to, but don't bring a date. A personal request to Peter Jackson: please don't use this Cinematographic technique again... It is terrible. Really."
"Al_The_Strange","10","23","41","28 December 2012"," ""The world is not in your book and maps. It's out there!""
","Ten years ago, I laid eyes on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and instantly fell in love. I realized pretty quickly that it was the perfect combination of style and substance: a film so loaded with story and detail, but also had enough style and action to make the experience truly epic. This experience would only be supplanted by The Two Towers and The Return of the King, the latter of which has taken its place as my personal number-one favorite movie.<br/><br/>After so many years of legal battles and creative turmoil, The Hobbit is finally adapted for the big screen. If anything could displace the Lord of the Rings as my favorite film trilogy, I was certain that it would be The Hobbit; if for no other reason than I found Tolkien's The Hobbit is a far easier and funner read than LOTR, and I always knew that there would be moments that would make for excellent cinema.<br/><br/>Despite the underwhelming reviews and reception, I found The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey satisfying; it met my expectations perfectly. I won't deny, however, that the film overall feels like a long-labored attempt to force lightning to strike twice. Not only because of all the story padding, connections to LOTR, returning stars, and the splitting of the story into three films, but also insomuch as trying to craft new iconic characters out of Bilbo and Thorin to mirror Frodo and Aragorn respectively. I think the thing that really gets on people's nerves is the sheer audacity in taking a single book (one that was previously adapted into a humble, bite-sized 79-minute cartoon) and exploding it into a 500-minute franchise. Thus follows the common complaints that the films are too long, too padded, too big for their own good.<br/><br/>Personally, none of these factors really affected my enjoyment of the film. The only real drag I felt was in the opening act; the Shire scenes seemed to take a good while to wrap up. Once the party hit the road, the film explored the big plot points I remembered well from the novel's first third, complete with awesome rip-roaring action. The film's final act is pretty jam-packed with loads of orc-slaying mayhem. Above all, however, the film has a nice sprinkling of humor and character throughout, keeping things lightweight and even. I think the most memorable and satisfying of scenes, however, will be the major encounters that I remember fondly from the novel: outwitting the three trolls, for example, or the riddle scenes with Gollum, are all brought to life perfectly on the big screen.<br/><br/>The story for The Hobbit is as quintessential of a fantasy adventure as, well, Lord of the Rings. The film not only does a fine job of packing in loads of events, characters, and fine details from The Hobbit's original narrative and story, but it also ties in some content from The Silmarillion and the appendices of Tolkien's books. A lot of this is incorporated to make tangible ties with LOTR, allowing the film to serve as a proper prequel, while digging up additional subplots, conflicts, and details to layer onto all of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films. Yes, the film could have all these extra scenes cut out, making the film trimmer. Frankly, I liked it the way it is. Some of the scenes helped me understand certain nuances of The Hobbit's politics and backstories. Some helped in the nuances of established characters and events (especially in regards to chronicling Gandalf's whereabouts, who would otherwise just pop in and out randomly, like in the book, but it would have probably alienated audiences further). Some is purely invented for the film series to streamline the continuity (purists might be outraged when they see Radagast on screen). It's a bit early to tell where The Hobbit is going with all the threads it has grabbed, but it does serve a purpose in the long run. If nothing else, it'll help average audiences connect and understand the Middle Earth on a deeper level, and set things up for later events in the next two films.<br/><br/>As expected, the film looks splendid, with quality photography and editing. I'm especially pleased to see that the filmmakers dropped the shaky-cam effects that were dispensed in the fight scenes of LOTR; just about every shot in The Hobbit is solid and steady. Acting is pretty decent from the whole cast; aside from all the familiar faces, Martin Freeman plays Bilbo with the right amount of nuanced uptightness, while Richard Armitage plays it tough as Thorin, and every other dwarf actor does their best to make their characters stand out in their own neat ways. Writing is great; the script adapts as much as it can from the novel, while allowing the film to breathe on its own. This production is loaded with excellent sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is nice too.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm biased, because this is another film where I see nothing really wrong with it. If anything, it feels like more of the same as LOTR, with the same construction as Fellowship of the Ring. Even if it is a blatant cash-grab, drawing out the material across three movies to maximize the franchise, it is still a fair crowd-pleaser. Given that we still have the desolation of Smaug and the Battle of the Five Armies to witness on the big screen, I'm certain that An Unexpected Journey is but a small taste of greater things to come; things that may prove to be as epic, if not moreso, than LOTR! At the very least, the film does perfect justice to the original novel, while delivering a fine spectacle. I couldn't ask for a finer film.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"

WTF!<br/><br/>Apparently the fame went to Peter Jackson's head and now he is pumping gout the same trite crap as James Cameron.<br/><br/>Skip this at all costs.

","I liked the LOTR movies. The first one, I thought was very good and the second and third were good enough. Nothing spectacular but not junky either.<br/><br/>However, this first installment of The Hobbit movie trilogy is so boring...<br/><br/>Endless scene after scene of characters running, swinging swords, shouting, screaming then running and fighting and falling again.<br/><br/>Who cares? Not much dialogue. Not much story progression. Not much of anything. Just 3 hours of really bad CGI and dull, dull characters.<br/><br/>Just a movie obviously drawn out so it can last 9+ hours over three installments.<br/><br/>I didn't care about any of the characters including Gandolf who I adored in The Fellowship of The Ring. But, even the brilliant and usually interesting Ian McClellan couldn't save this lazily made achingly boring mess.<br/><br/>I don't care if anymore of these movies come out. But I am going to read the book over again to recapture the richness and excitement of Tolkein's wonderful book."

","If this and KING KONG are what Peter Jackson are capable of when he's given free rein, then someone please bring back the bit and bridle. I've heard complaints about the movie from purists, but I am not one, and don't really care that the story has been extended...just that it's been done so tediously. Don't look for anything similar to the theatrical releases for the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy...think more the DVD director's cuts.<br/><br/>I liked the background presented in the opening of the movie, but in hindsight it is a rather long prologue that is a good indicator for the next two and a half hours. Other than the interesting scenes of character interaction and dialog, it feels like half of the movie is an extended chase/combat sequence and/or majestic (CGI?) aerial views (though actual minute count may be lower, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was actually more than half of the movie). It's not action-porn like the last couple of TRANSFORMERS movies, but it's more like adventure-porn (""porn"" in the sense that much of it seems gratuitous and unnecessary to furthering the story).<br/><br/>If you have a high tolerance for drawn out adventure (with occasional ridiculous feats having more in common with THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL than the first trilogy), this movie may be for you. Otherwise, take a blanket, and prepare to pay for a ten dollar nap.<br/><br/>***SPOILER???*** It reminded me of the difference between episodes one through three of the STAR WARS trilogy when compared to episodes four through six. Perhaps if I wasn't already familiar with how things turn out, there would be a real sense of adventure and danger in the action and chase...but probably not. There are plenty of movies I watch repeatedly, regardless of knowing how they turn out. With this one, I only stayed to the ending because I was interested to see where they chose to make a chapter break in the story. As it turns out, not any place worth my revisiting."

","This is not a bad film. But it is not the film people are describing. The Hobbit is a children's book of approximately 300 pages. Each of the three LOTR books are a good deal longer than the Hobbit, but they only got a single film apiece...while The Hobbit gets three. You can already tell what the film's primary issue will be, and it is: pacing. And that is the film's major issue. Some scenes are dragged out to ridiculous extents. And, while LOTR films were very long, there was NEVER any filler in them. Every single thing that occurred in those films was important for the continuation of the plot (at least in the theatrical versions). But there is soooo much filler in The Hobbit that it is ridiculous! The film's primary antagonist was not even in the book! And that is just one of the many, many filler scenes in the film, that I have no time explaining here. <br/><br/>The film also suffers from a lack of a consistent tone. One scene can be as dark as LOTR, and the very next will have a wizard riding a sled of bunnies. A scene as ridiculous as this does not belong in a film like The Hobbit. First off, because it was NEVER IN THE BOOK, and second because it disengages you from the film, because it completely breaks from the tone of the previous scenes, and because the wizard with the bunnies does absolutely nothing to advance the story, and looks like it belongs in another film.<br/><br/>And don't say that The Hobbit is a children's book, and this is why there are some childish moments in the film. I would buy that, except the film goes out of its way to connect itself to the LOTR trilogy, and when it tries to do so, one can not help but to compare it to the LOTR films. If this was made as a standalone film, I would be able to look past it inconsistencies. However, I simply can not do that. And keep in mind, I only gave you a few examples of what I am talking about as far as the filler and random, unimportant scenes in the movie. Literally about half of the movie did not need to exist, and is simply there so that three movies can be made, so the studios can make more money. <br/><br/>The Hobbit should have been two films. I believe that they could have simply made one, but I think two films would have been fine as well. I will not discuss the visuals here, but I will say that they are decent, but I honestly prefer LOTR visuals to Hobbit's. Including Gollum. <br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit was a decent film, but suffered a good bit from inconsistencies and filler that is clearly there for filler. I love LOTR, but i simply found the Hobbit okay. I will give it a 6 because there were certain things that did work, and everything that did came from the original novel."

","I have to say, as a die-hard fan of the books, that this movie was blown for me in the first 20 minutes. I could live with many of the story additions, because I know that one little book was being stretched into three movies, and most of the additions were just to basically take up time (and some were pretty pointless). Those changes didn't change the basic storyline, though, so I was able to let those go. However, the one that I had a major problem with was in the beginning when they showed the Elves refusing to help the dwarfs, and thereby causing the strife between the Elves and the dwarfs. NO! NO! NO! That did NOT happen in the book! That struck me as off right from the start, and I even went back and re-read the book to be sure. It was not the Elves that caused the strife, but the dwarfs' own greed, and this happens later on. What I haven't figured out is if this change in the movie was made to make the dwarfs look better (and less like the greedy buggers that they were back then-remember that they evolved over the course of the series) or the Elves look worse (did somebody think they were too perfect?). What scares me the most is what changes this might cause later on in the following movies. After all, if Thranduil didn't want to risk the lives of his people and won't go to war in this movie, why would he bother later? Same circumstances still apply, right? War would still involve loss of life. Which, presumably, means that there would have to be some other sort of change that will provide the motivation. I can only hope that Jackson doesn't resort to the lure of the gold, because with this story change they could have had that if they had helped in the beginning, and none of this will make any sense."

","I enjoyed this movie to the max. Peter Jackson really outdid himself there. The Hobbit is a movie prequel to The Lord of the Rings, dealing with Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who was tricked into having a party at his abode. Earlier, a dwarf king rules a mountain until a dragon takes the gold the king has hoarded. That act cost him his life. Though Bilbo was very reluctant at first, he comes to aid when the Mountain Trolls steal the ponies, then capture the army for their dinner. Bilbo stalled them long enough for Galdolf the Grey (Ian McKellan) makes his move by cracking some light on the trolls: they fear bright light. Then they encounter the cave where they find the treasure and some weaponry in which Bilbo gets a sword for himself. This sword has a blue glow to it. Then after the separation of him and the dwarfs he encounter Gollum, a hobbit who was corrupted by a ring. Bilbo took it from him while he was eating the goblin. Following the battle, Bilbo proved his worth. This prequel has a very good meaning to it. Tolkien works will remember many things for years to come. It's great. 5 stars!"

","Before I begin reviewing this movie, I have to tell you that I'm a big Tolkien nerd. And with that I mean the books. But It all started with the Lord of the Rings movies, so I'm also a big fan of the movies.<br/><br/>I looked forward to this movie for 3 years or so. Ever since I first heard they were making a movie about the Hobbit. Maybe it even started earlier, after I saw LotR and read the Hobbit. But it doesn't matter. I was very anxious to see this movie, and I tracked every detail. Which actors, crew members, director. There was a period they said Del Torro was going to direct it, and I felt sad. I wanted everything to be exactly the way it was in LotR. And finally, when they announced that Peter Jackson was going to direct the movie, I felt happy.<br/><br/>I went to the cinema with some friends, picked the best seats I could imagine. Of course went to the iMax 3D version and sat down with a over sized bucket of popcorn and a beer. I watched the movie in one run, there was no break. After the movie finished my friends went to a bar to discuss the movie. I went with them and got completely drunk. Why? To forget all my sorrows, laid upon me by this absolute ^$*# they dare to call a movie. I felt heartbroken. It felt like I visited the lake house where I went with my parents when I was a child. Only to discover now that it has become a dark, filthy place filled with skyscrapers and Guido's. <br/><br/>The movie was stretched, it was too long with too little to tell. The scene in bag end was long and boring, missing the point completely. The whole movie felt like a childish, cheap remake of what could be the movie of the year. The CGI was bad, the music was bad... They put characters in it just to please the simple minded LotR fans. <br/><br/>As you see I'm still angry, and it's purely because I'm sad. Very, very sad. My childhood love has turned into an ugly piece of *$%#. <br/><br/>But hey, maybe there's still hope. There are yet two parts to come. But for now the only thing I regret is that I was happy with the decision that Peter Jackson was going to direct the movie. Maybe Del Torro was not such a bad idea."

And finally they are falling hundreds of meters in to the abyss while standing on a piece of the bridge - without a scratch.<br/><br/>If other two parts will be in the same manner, I'm sorry to say but I think that, after 3 masterpieces, they have decided to make 3 mastersh..s.

","I watched this in 3D and I'd have to say, the graphics is as real as it gets. Absolutely stunning, I can't imagine how many CG artists have worked on the amazing details of the 3D models. Definitely one of the most photorealistic CGs I've seen to date, yet. The best graphics however are totally ruined by a boring and slow storyline. The plots move on extremely slowly, and after the first hour I was already beginning to wonder when the movie will end (unfortunately it's 3 hours). They tried to throw in funny spots in the script but did not work at all, the dialogs just feel stupid. Throughout the movie, the actions are repeated over and over again and boring. The editing is also poorly done. I don't feel nervous or excited watching the main characters fight at all, there are too much fighting scenes of the same kind and I ended up just watching the beauty of the computer graphics instead. I could not enjoy the storyline at all. Overall? Don't waste 3 hours of your time on this movie. It's not worth it, it's not motivating, it's not touching. It's just some sort of demonstrations of how good our 3D computer graphics can get today."
"marco-maletti","3","29","54","11 January 2013"," The Trilogy That Needs a Eulogy.
","I have to wonder if I saw the same film as some of the other reviewers... <br/><br/>The story is lacking in depth, and one would expect in a 3 hour movie they could give the characters more depth. I generally find it easy to immerse myself in movies but overall I felt completely disconnected from the characters and I never got drawn into the Hobbit. <br/><br/>The story is clearly aimed at children, but the fight scenes and action violence would make my 7-year old close her eyes and block her ears, just as well because I wouldn't want her watching beheadings. <br/><br/>I know this is a fantasy story, but even fantasy-land has to adhere to some basic physical principles in order to retain credibility. So when two giant rocks are smashed together and shatter, causing bits of rock to fly everywhere, you'd expect the characters who were in-between the two pieces of rock to be, uh, smashed, but instead they're alive and well. So many examples of this convenient departure from logic appear throughout the movie that even my ten year old would say: ""Oh Come On!!!""<br/><br/>There are so many unnecessary battle scenes that did nothing to aid the story and were just there to pad the film out. It was unbearably slow and after a half-hour I wanted to walk out. When they made Lord of the Rings they had too much material. With the Hobbit, they don't have enough for three 3 hour movies, but instead of doing the logical thing and putting it all into one 2-3 hour movie, they pad it out to make it fit. One has to wonder if they did this simply to make money. The slim hope that the movie would get better and the fact that I was there with friends were the only things that kept me there. Had I been by myself I would've spared myself the waste of time.<br/><br/>They used so much CGI in the film that they could've saved themselves the hassle of using real actors and just made a cartoon movie. Having said that, the only thing that prevented this movie from getting one or two stars from me was the fact that there were some amazing visuals, but it was all style, no substance.<br/><br/>Never say never, but I seriously doubt I'll be watching parts two or three of this trilogy. I would honestly rather sit and stare at a blank screen for 3 hours than subject myself to this."
"ken-1164","1","42","82","17 December 2012"," Awful, nothing unexpected about that after Bored of The Rings
","The Hobbit is the novel that made me fall in love with literature when I was 10 years old. I read it every year for at least 15 years, and a few times since and it never fails to amuse and entertain me. Now, I realise that there are lots of people who loved the Lord Of The Rings movie - most of whom had never read the book - it was a typical Hollywood adaptation, all sound and fury signifying nothing. Peter Jackson upset millions of genuine LOTR fans as well as the Tolkien estate by re-writing the novel to make it nothing more than a dull, over-long, self-indulgent CGI popcorn movie. I had hoped, given that The Hobbit is a much simpler and lighter tale that Jackson might restrain himself and just tell the story, but no, once again he has the arrogance to believe he is a greater creator than Tolkien and rewrites massive segments of the story, adding events and characters that didn't exist in the book, and which don't add any value whatsoever to the story. On the contrary, they make the movie dull, flat, boring, and over-long. There is no question that Peter Jackson is just milking this to rake in as many bucks as he can. It's cynical and calculated and lacking any respect for the source material. The addition of characters and story elements from LOTR who were not mentioned in the book is particularly distasteful. I should have expected nothing more after LOTR, so my bad for stumping up my hard- earned cash to go and see it. I came very close to walking out of the cinema in disgust, and I will certainly not be paying to see the sequels."

"georgechristophert","1","87","185","18 December 2012"," Milked, Uncreative, Disappointing
","I must preface this by saying that I think the film is more like a 6, but I am giving it a 1 because I think that its current 8.6 rating is exaggerated.<br/><br/>This film is obviously done for the sake of milking a franchise. Which is surprising since the previous films were done so well and Jackson doesn't seem that type.<br/><br/>While the film is relatively entertaining, the visuals are very impressive (48fps gives a feel of almost seeing things with your own eyes which is something to adjust to), the sound was great but there are many facets to this film that make it a disappointment.<br/><br/>Artificial/Forced dramatic tension: the film lacks dramatic tension and a high stakes feel besides some really cool actions sequences. Despite this lack of real, high stakes, the music score and directing often attempts to coerce the viewer to identify a relatively insignificant moment as being a great dramatic moment. This happens throughout the film, and overall there is really no arc to any of the characters or to the story as a whole. The whole film is one action sequence to overcome after another. The character Bilbo is the closest one to have an arc and, while the Freeman did a fine job, the script really just lacks any genuine sense of there being such an arc.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the musical score continually and unnecessarily embellishes scene after scene in order to compensate for the obvious lack of tension and grandeur. Or perhaps such an embellishment was necessary since the filmmakers were aware of the weakness of the character's relationships and dialogue.<br/><br/>Its comparable to listening to AC/DC while watching a motionless gold fish in a bowl, the two just don't go together, but the rock n roll is trying to absorb you into the anti-climatic fish experience.<br/><br/>That is kind of an exaggerated example, but you get my point.<br/><br/>Also, some scenes and bits are taken straight from LOTR, which, while attempting to create a oneness of feel with the other films, instead comes off as almost forcing about recall and evinces a lack of originality and creativity.<br/><br/>That is the general feel of the film, they are trying to cast it as being a story that is as epic as the LOTR, as high stakes as the LOTR, while it is obvious that the story just lacks that punch. Instead of embracing the Hobbit for what it is, a children's story, they are trying to make it into something that it isn't, an epic.<br/><br/>In this process, they drag the film on WAY TOO LONG and even make the little story into 3 films. I almost want to watch the other two just as a lesson on how soullessly Hollywood milks a story that is already practically empty.<br/><br/>But the film must be presented as an epic to justify making three of them.<br/><br/>The fact is that the story obviously falls short of that status despite great attempts via technology, sound, and stunning visuals to force about a contrary reception.<br/><br/>For all these reasons I was continually disappointed by this film.<br/><br/>The last complaint was that I saw the film with the Dolby Atmos and I literally had to cover my ears throughout sequences because they were being shattered by the high volume. That has never happened in a movie and the staff told me that it was Dolby who set the volumes and they are still, obviously, finding the right levels.<br/><br/>On a positive note: the acting was great, despite many of the Dwarfs and villains coming off as caricatures. Armitage was fantastic as Thorin, and McKellan was top notch. Freeman and Serkis as well.<br/><br/>New Zealand was as beautiful as ever too.<br/><br/>But after scene after scene of forced, false stakes, the absence of a really engaging, conflict laded story (besides action sequences), the obvious nods to the LOTR films, the unfitting, forced score, and sometimes searing sound of Dolby Atmos, I was anxious to leave the theatre. And I rarely so poorly receive films, which is why I am writing this.<br/><br/>And I'm not some sap saying, ""Oh it didn't do the book justice."" I don't even remember the book, its been so long.<br/><br/>The movie simply lacks soul. It seems obvious that it was made for money and not to tell a good story.<br/><br/>I wish they would have taken the film in a totally different direction than LOTR. They should have done so since the Hobbit, despite being in the same world, is NOT the epic tale that LOTR is.<br/><br/>Those who clapped after the film and gave this film a 10 were duped by sound and visuals into believing that this film was something that it was not. To those who see clearly, the film is simply false."

","We waited until this weekend to see ""The Hobbit"", to let the crowds die down, so what I'm saying has probably already been said by several others. Still, let me put in my two cents' worth...<br/><br/>Once again Peter Jackson has felt compelled to repaint the smile on the Mona Lisa, just as he did with the LOTR movies. The movie best succeeds when it sticks to the book, and falters when it wanders away. The first hour is interminable. The appearances of Arwen and Saruman at Rivendell were superfluous (unless to set up another ""Arwen, Warrior Princess"" appearance in the next movie). The less said about Radagast and his rabbit-driven sleigh, the better. Finally, there were too many ""deus ex machina"" moments (most notably the eagles just showing up out of nowhere to rescue the dwarfs, Bilbo, and Gandalf--read the book for some much-needed context on that).<br/><br/>Not to say that there are not some good parts to this movie. Ian McKellen, of course, IS Gandalf. The interaction between Bilbo and Gollum is spot on. The visuals, while gimmicky at times (particularly the escape from Goblin Town), are a tour de force. (Can't wait to see what they do with Smaug.) I won't tell you not to see ""The Hobbit"".

","Director Peter Jackson, along with a tremendous amount of assistance from cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (""The Lord Of the Rings"" trilogy) has again created a wonderful visual motion picture experience that is both amazingly expansive, yet lush and personable.<br/><br/>With all of that written, however, his adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien tome (screenplay by Jackson, Guillermo del Toro, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens), like his 2005 version of the classic ""King Kong,"" has unending style, yet little substance to sustain its almost excruciating 170-minute running time.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit,"" as a book may hold cult status for many literati, but it was more of a juvenile work and has always played the second cousin to the darker, more mature LOTR. And, so far as a film franchise, the very same applies. <br/><br/>Despite the various story lines running to and fro in that three-movie series, there was no question regarding the success Jackson achieved in keeping the plots in cohesive and lucid control.<br/><br/>In this newest effort, ""An Unexpected Journey,"" we do not see that cohesion and, oftentimes, the action appears wildly unweilding and confusing. The scenes blend and blur at times, and the pacing is dreadfully off. Some sequences go on indefinitely, while others begin and end in a flash.<br/><br/>And some just go nowhere. For example, there is one which features what I would assume are terrifying giant spiders that attack the bumbling wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy, ""Eldorado""), but then disappear never to return. I know they're setting up some things for the eventual sequels, but some of these omissions are a bit unnerving.<br/><br/>Like ""King Kong,"" which took almost an hour to take off, and was then completely bogged down again by the long-running dinosaur and giant insect sequences, this picture shows the same pattern of chases, fights and resting over and over and over again. There is definitely action here, but those scenes are so few and far between, we become overcome at times with complete tedium overload.<br/><br/>Populating the film with 15 protagonists (although only two are of real interest, the title creature, Bilbo Baggins, and Gandalf the Wizard) also lends for only a small amount of overall character development opportunities. Consequently, little, if any, empathy is gained from the cast and the movie - while so beautiful to watch - becomes strangely difficult to become emotionally involved with.<br/><br/>The story follows Baggins (Martin Feeman, a voice in ""Pirates: Band Of Misfits""), who is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor, which was conquered by the dragon Smaug. Approached by wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen, ""Gods and Monsters,"" LOTR), Baggins finds himself joining a company of 13 dwarfs, led by warrior Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"").<br/><br/>At first, the gentle and unassuming hobbit wants nothing to do with this adventure, or the crowd of obnoxious dwarfs who invade his home and devour almost all of his year's supply of food, but for the movie's sake, he soon signs on and finds himself battling Middle Earth creatures, large, vicious wolf-like monsters, evil giants and the goblin Gollum (Andy Serkis ""King Kong""), even attaining that entity's ""precious"" gold ring, which of course, was instrumental in Jackson's last three-film franchise.<br/><br/>And that is another of ""The Hobbit's"" problems as Baggins and Co. encounter not only Gollum, but elves Elrond and Galadriel (Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett), the sorcerer Saruman (Christopher Lee), and other characters from LOTR. Even Frodo (Eligah Wood) makes an early appearance. It's almost as if Jackson were trying to make LOTR IV instead of ""The Hobbit I."" <br/><br/>As uninvolved as I was emotionally, however, the look of ""The Hobbit"" remains a wonder of seamless filmmaking technology. Jackson's vision of Tolkien's Middle Earth, the crags of Lonely Mountain and the foreboding bowels of the Goblin Tunnels are breathtaking and magnificent achievements. Academy Awards galore should be heaped upon him for these creations.<br/><br/>However, Gandalf says early in the proceedings, ""All stories need a little embellishment,"" we assume to make them more palatable and exciting. It's too bad Jackson did not follow his own advice here."

The Goblin King looks like Jar-Jar Binks on acid with a skin condition and goiter and about as much intelligence and personality. The three trolls behave like the Three Stooges. You only see Smaug the dragon for a few seconds and the Necromancer for less than that. Radagast the Brown is a crazy magic mushroom-tripping wizard with bird-poop running down his face and crusted to his beard who drives a magic sled pulled by giant bunny rabbits. Retarded!!! Hated all the new annoying characters except the main dwarfs (Thorin, Balin, and Dwalin, IIRC). Bilbo didn't get to do much. Other characters (Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman, Frodo) have pointless cameos and add zero to the story, just drag the unendurable running time out even further. There's some lame attempt to connect this story to the Lord of the Rings, but that amounts to a couple lines in a boring round-table conversation between the cameo cast. <br/><br/>Despite all the stupid action, nobody on the team ever dies or is in any real danger as they get saved at the last minute by Gandalf every time things don't go their way. So there's zero suspense. The action is so impossible to believe at times that it makes most cartoons look realistic by comparison. I suppose it's better than the god-awful Phantom Menace (which also only had one cool scene with Darth Maul's fight), but not by much. It feels like a parody of the original LotR trilogy.

Not only do the scenic landscapes cover you in goosebumps, the amount of details is also awe-inspiring. Every single wart on every single, butt ugly ork, every hair in a dwarfs beard... it adds up to a whole new level of viewing experience.<br/><br/>In the beginning, I was very impressed by the movie. At times, it is literally like the book, they even use the same lines. But as the story went on, they not only kept changing things (which I usually have no problem with) but also ADDING stuff that did not appear in the book. I admit, they did a good job there, adding that white Ork for example (it works well in the movie, and does not seem planted) but that weird feeling remained that Peter Jackson just wants to make three movies out of one little book to make more money. I sometimes got the impression that the film-makers were stretching the story like dough with a rolling pin. But hey, it worked rather well, and maybe I'm just complaining about something here that is not really an issue. Actually, I think ""The Hobbit"" might be one of the very few cases where the film is not leaving things out that were in the book, but doing the opposite... so kudos to the makers.<br/><br/>However, I do also have a ""real"" issue with that movie. Just when you're completely immersed in Middle earth, when you can smell the fresh grass and flowers in the Shire, feel the icy breeze in the mountains and the thundering dash of the wargs, when it becomes REAL... it hits you in the face and reminds you that it is, actually, just a movie. A movie for kids, on top of that. And it keeps doing that again and again, until the magic is gone and you leave the theater being slightly annoyed and disappointed instead of open mouthed and very impressed (which some would expect from such an enormous movie project) The thing that stole most of the magic for me was the seeming invulnerability of the dwarfs. Peter Jackson puts them into the utmost life-threatening, no, DEADLY situations, only to let them emerge unscathed and laughing, every single one of them. He rains whole mountains of rocks on them, drops them into caves hundreds of feet deep, and sends several armies of Orks and Goblins at them, which they butcher with childish ease. Really, fat, stubby dwarfs killing dozens of orks, using moves that slightly remind of Asian martial arts? Really?? Jumping around like those girls in ""Kill Bill"", when you're just as broad as you are long, does not work! And while we're at the fighting scenes... apparently, all of the gargantuan budget was spent on helicopter flights for the landscape shots and stunt men for the ""dancy"" fight scenes, so there was nothing left over to buy some artificial blood; because that is really lacking. When you do to a living thing what the dwarfs do to the pitiful orks, you expect more than a little liquid to flow, or at least stain your weapons. But oh wait, the movie has to be appropriate for the kiddies too, so none of that please! After all, we want them to spend their allowance on three 2+h films. Another thing that bugged me was the behavior of the dwarfs in Elrond's valley. They were like little kids, not eating their vegetables, but stuffing it into their ears because someone was playing the harp. So funny! (when you're 12...) In Tolkiens story, they enjoyed staying with the elves, and in Jacksons, they try to be funny by being very childish, but it backfires.<br/><br/>Again, these might not be such big issues... had they not gone full length in making EVERYTHING seem so very real. It looks simply too real to allow unrealistic scenes. Perfect realism and ultra-extensive detail does not mix well with a childish screenplay, in my humble opinion. Sure, in the movie's defense, one could say that the book is sometimes just like that. Well, then they just shouldn't have wasted all that effort on it, I say. If you want to make an incredibly realistic film, you have to write the screenplay accordingly, or the magic is gone. <br/><br/>I give it 6/10. The special effects were just too amazing to behold, and they would have earned it more than 10/10 for sure, but the screenplay crashed it."
"bottokar","1","17","30","2 July 2013"," Way too much fight
","On the whole it wouldn't be bad, but the original story is vanishing in the flood of fight scenes. And it's way too much. Of course I understand that they want to make three time as much money with 3 movies instead of a really good and pure one. In the original story, fight is not emphasized at all, only a few page from the novel. On the other hand I like the cast and the their acting. No problem with that. I hate this, and this is why I gave 1 out of 10. AND I won't watch the other two parts, no way! It is very sad, because I like this story very much, but simply I just can't watch other 6 hours of massive fight in a movie which not supposed to be an action movie!"

","It's been nine years since we last saw Peter Jackson's tackle Tolkien's fantastical world on the big screen, but now the New Zealand filmmaker returns with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The first of three film adaptations of the classic children's book, it's grandiloquence will please the fanatics, but leave those on the fence feeling disappointed and potentially nauseous.<br/><br/>After a boisterous battle prologue, An Unexpected Journey starts similarly to The Fellowship of the Ring: in the comfort of the Hobbit Shire with Frodo's uncle, Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), sitting in his subterranean bachelor pad and eulogising his past. From here, the film sinks in to flashback, and the young Bilbo (played now by Martin Freeman) has uninvited guests for dinner: Gandalf the Grey (Sir Ian McKellan) and thirteen rowdy, mostly forgettable dwarfs, with twee names like Oin and Gloin and elaborate Movember facial attire. Following some hobbit bashing and poor dining etiquette, the indignant Bilbo is convinced to help the dwarfs on their pursuit to reclaim their former kingdom after it was taken over by the dragon Smaug, and they all set off on a quest across Middle-earth to reclaim their lost land. Along the way, they get into scrapes with man-eating trolls, conniving goblins, maniacal orcs and intellectual elves (headed once again by Cate Blanchett's Galadriel).<br/><br/>Early on in the film's hefty 169 minute running time, Gandalf turns to young Bilbo and suggests, 'every good story needs embellishment'. The wizard is wise. Based on the first 100 pages of the novel, Jackson and his team of writers – now including Guillermo del Toro of Pan's Labyrinth fame – struggle to hatch a consistently entertaining story to meet the excessive film length. Borrowing from the rest of Tolkien's legendarium, there are superfluous subplots involving the annoying forest-dwelling wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy), and a tedious fight-out between two anthropomorphic rock creatures, lasting a whopping eight minutes.<br/><br/>Even with a flabby storyline, some of the performances impress. Freeman is simply fantastic as Bilbo. Famous as the hapless hero Tim from Ricky Gervais' The Office, he brings much needed humour and heart to the film. Sir Ian McKellen is on fantastic form as the altruistic Gandalf, and Andy Serkis steals the show once again as the schizophrenic Gollum, who loses his 'precious' ring for the first time in a memorable cryptic showdown with Bilbo.<br/><br/>In an attempt to make the special effects and props look as realistic as possible, the film is expensively shot at 48 frames per second, rather than the standard 24. It's a jarring experience; instead of the desired effect, such absolute perfection and detail causing the film to look stage, even imperfect. To it's credit the new technological advance works to great effect with battle sequences, but is bothersome during the smaller, dramatic moments (seeing big footed hobbits waddle along New Zealand mountain sides is funny enough without it looking like it's being played at double-speed). It's a great shame, particularly because the 3D – for a change – is pretty darn good. But, with reports of audience members falling ill during screenings, the simulated feeling of The Hobbit may be too much for some to stomach.<br/><br/>Like the blighted Star Wars prequels, the reawakening of this box-office devouring monster- franchise was bound to be tough. Its financial success inevitable, The Hobbit is something of a Lord of the Rings – diet edition. There are some moments of storytelling finesse, yet they are dragged down by the fellowship formula.<br/><br/>In the film's closing moments, Bilbo turns to the rest of his gruff amigos and says, 'I do believe the worst is behind us'. With another two, three-hour movies to follow, we can only hope that Jackson spares us the same torment.<br/><br/>More reviews at www.366movies.com"

","I saw the normal 24 fps non 3D version of The Hobbit so I have nothing to say about the quality of the controversial 48fps version or the 3D version. <br/><br/>First off anyone that says ""you have to read the book "" which some of the com-mentors on this board have mentioned as one of the reasons why critics aren't as enthused as the fans, should realize that a filmmakers job is not to create a companion piece for a book but to create a comprehensible film that can stand on its own and doesn't require research to be appreciated. This is coming from someone who almost always prefers the book and has refused to see certain movies because of how much suck-age is involved with the casting of actors, the director or the screenwriter some of the films that I flat out refuse to watch are Seabiscuit, The Adventures of Tintin The Watchmen etc. Some of my favorite films are based on some of my favorite books though such as Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange, Princes Bride To Kill a Mockingbird etc. so I guess great books can be adapted into great films. <br/><br/>This is my breakdown of the film. <br/><br/>pro- The acting: there weren't any bad performances, most of them were actually very strong-8/10 <br/><br/>pro- The sets, costumes and props were all amazing -8/10 <br/><br/>pro- Cinematography: the film looked very beautiful-8/10 <br/><br/>con-adaptation of material: turning a 400 page book into a nine hour trilogy is f%cking stupid. I read fan-boy comments defending the dragging pace of the film by saying that the book is slow in in some parts too, the major difference between a book and a film though is that an author has to set the scene, tell you what the characters are doing and what they are saying, whereas a film accomplishes two thirds of this visually, thus a film should always be shorter than the source material-2/10 <br/><br/>con- the action: many of the action sequences were incredibly nonsensical and unnecessarily stupid. Here is a short list of scenes that annoyed me the most. <br/><br/>The rock monsters(literal rock em' sock em' robots). I understand they were in the book but the characters never took a ride on them in the book FYI to all you fan-boys and how do 12 dwarfs and a hobbit hang on to fighting mountains in the rain with boulders being flung about. <br/><br/>Thorin getting clubbed in the face with a mace (def: stick with heavy spiky metal on the end used to crush armor) by an opponent twice his size mounted on a giant dog. REALLY!!!.. IT'S A GODDAMN MACE , Thorin walks away unscathed. <br/><br/>Domino pine tree's: this was also a sweet nugget that peter Jackson pulled from his rectum because it sure didn't go down like that in the book, dwarfs jumping from one tree to the next as the tree's tumble to the ground. <br/><br/>Surfing down a cavern on a bridge with 14 people on it, they land safely in the soft embrace of the splintered bridge fragments hundreds of feet below, for comedic effect 600 lb. goblin king with ball-sack chin falls on them. HOW IS THIS ACCEPTABLE OR ENTERTAINING TO PEOPLE . <br/><br/>There are too many stupid things in this movie for me to write them all down, suffice it to say that peter Jackson has joined the ""I'M SO F#CKING AWESOME DIRECTORS CLUB"" with the likes of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. You can only join this club if you are a self congratulatory director that surrounds themselves with yes men."
"Spondonman","7","8","12","18 August 2013"," Repetitive and repetitive
","Never managed to read the books but overall I enjoyed the Lord Of The Rings film trilogy with its relentless use of cgi cartoonery taken to its limits in furtherance of the story. So I was also looking forward to seeing this, the prequel being also a trilogy. Some people may want to call it Art, I call it maximising the potentialities of this particular revenue stream. After director Jackson has done with it maybe he'll find a way to continue the saga, in the same way that Dune, Shannara and other tales have been resurrected in print more times than Frankenstein.<br/><br/>Band of ragtag dwarfs looking for a home come unbidden in Bilbo Baggins the anti-hero's home to devise a way with Gandalf the hairy wiz to get their home in the Lonely Mountain back from the clutches of the Smaug dragon. Who unaccountably loves gold. One tedious chase or flight leads to another, however I suppose the tension does alternate between the tedious and the tiresome. The story development is almost nil because of the screenplay elongation and repetition in the real Quest to get money from the hordes of Smaugheads. The cutting edge cartoonery is used to the max, this alternating between impressive and laughable. Repetitive, complete and devastating mayhem rules yet there is no doubt there will be no casualties (except in the game version): vast mountain ranges thumping one another over their heads, half a million goblin-shapes against 14 are great odds, and falling miles into jagged ravines the brave band is as indestructible as Captain Scarlet would've been. Sometimes from a distance it looks like millions of hieroglyphics zanily slipping and sliding about a page. Gollum looked more like an old fashioned cartoon in this outing though, methinks someone was trying to save a few bob on him. I love all kinds of cartoons but this is unlovely. This was a motion picture I've just watched passively, not a game or I'm missing the controls.<br/><br/>Most kids under 20 years old will be entranced by it, older kids will face an increasing problem: they've seen it all before, and in this case within the same film too. It's incredibly well made in most visual departments and I enjoyed it to a point but along with most other ordinary films I've watched will never ever watch it again. My problem now is do I still bother with the next 3 hour instalment: The Hobbit – The Expected Flogging Of A Dead Horse."

","This movie is blasphemy for everyone that read anything by Tolkien. Special effects and costumes does NOT make movie great, that is what for video games are, awful story but good effects are for games. Worst thing is that movie makers had great story, but they successfully ruined it. I always doubt there is material in hobbit for 3 movies, and I was right. To make this possible, authors of movie, filled movie time with unnecessary and non Tolkien's lines. Many of that lines are opposite with Tolkien's world, and Tolkien's characters. There are some spoilers in movie from Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion and Unfinished stories by Tolkien that are unrelated with Tolkien's Hobbit. My opinion is that P.J. Wanted to connect to much this movie with LOTR, because it should be prequel to it, but he only succeed to ruin every great moment from the book. I'm petrified from fear what will he put in other 2 movies... Because works like this movies will never can compare with book, and this should not be like that... Did they even bother to read anything Tolkien wrote before filmmaking? Blasphemy!!!!"
"dharmendrasingh","7","14","24","23 February 2013"," An unexpected mediocrity
","Returning to Middle Earth felt a bit like a school reunion. I was pleased to be back, but slightly embarrassed and curiously unconcerned about former acquaintances. Two screenings caused me to wish they had left Tolkien's book well alone. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson can't be blamed. Or maybe he can be. He adapts the book so faithfully (or at least the first 50 pages I've read) that you wonder why he bothered. <br/><br/>The truth is The Hobbit is an inferior story to the Lord of the Rings. It's that simple. Compared with the grave prospect of the race of Men's extinction in Rings, this is kids' stuff – as Gandalf says, 'an adventure'. I could not watch it as a separate, distinct film. I saw it, and I'm sure others did too, as a direct prequel to Rings. <br/><br/>Why didn't Jackson make The Hobbit first? That he didn't, I think, is significant. Perhaps 15 years ago he didn't feel it was worth putting on the screen. Perhaps he didn't then feel the story was epic enough. Perhaps three billion reasons forced him to reconsider. <br/><br/>Whilst my second viewing (from a better vantage point) impressed me slightly more, nothing is new or improved. That's the paradox. How many sequels and prequels do we rue because of their deviance from the original? My complaint isn't that Jackson doesn't give us what we want; it's that he gives us what HE wants. Is this a director at the height of his creative ability producing something just because he can? The 1:3 book-to-film ratio would indeed suggest so. <br/><br/>Yes, the Orcs are scarier; yes, some of the fighting is bloodier; and yes, the Pale Orc Azog is truly menacing, especially with his improvised left arm, but compare these things to what's not so good. All 13 dwarfs are bereft of any character. At least Gimley was funny. The film felt desperately dragged out, despite some stunning sequences, including an exhilarating fight with goblins and a stunning bout between rocky mountains! The often dubious CGI cannot, however, be excused. <br/><br/>I am not optimistic about the next two films. Sure, I'll see them. I don't mind being proved wrong. But if this is to happen, some serious tweaking needs to be done before December. At the very least they ought to make Smaug look like he isn't from Mike the Knight."

","far too long, drawn out and boring. I actually got up and walked away for a bit to get some fresh air then came back and watched the rest. the story is from a small book yet they have drawn it out into 3 movies at 3 hours each, and the story really suffers as a result. like what were they thinking except money money money. I understand why the Lord of the Rings trilogy was well a trilogy, because it is based off 3 books! I am a childhood fan of the books, but I will not waste my time on the next two movies as they have ruined the whole series in my eyes.

","I thought this movie was so bad, much like Jackson's King Kong was really bad. It was SO overlong that I sat in the movie theater and pondered when it would end. I will most certainly NOT see the rest of series. I know that if Jackson had followed the book (with some adaptation changes to keep the continuity with LOTR in check, like the Rivendell sequence) and made a two hour movie adaptation I would be very happy. Considering that the original book wasn't a great masterpiece like LOTR was a single movie would be the best. It seems like that Jackson was SO preoccupied with subplots that he lost his way with the main plot (again like with King Kong). This was simply a bad overlong movie made by a now very pretentious film maker."
"rjvanderwerf","5","43","88","19 December 2012"," Great visuals....but otherwise only worth renting.
","I'm going to say upfront that the visuals were great and the 3D felt worth it for this film. The visuals and cinematography were the best I've seen since Avatar. However, it felt to be lacking in every other instance. <br/><br/>The beginning when Bilbo meets Gandalf felt incredibly awkwardly written and performed. It was as if the writer's did not know how to reintroduce characters we are all plenty of aware of. Aside from the initial action scenes this movie was not starting off on a good foot. This then led to the hour long ""dinner party"" which was boring and quite frankly not needed. I am sure this was only an excuse to make the film hit it's three hour mark. It could have been cut drastically and still held it's merit. <br/><br/>I love Martin Freeman (Sherlock and Hitchhikers Guide were great roles!). However, his brand of humor and acting did very little for this movie.<br/><br/>At times certain things seemed to be added only to make all ring's fans happy they were back in middle earth. There was no other good reason. The reintroduction of Frodo in the beginning is one of them. <br/><br/>Also the humor in this film felt very off most times. This film did not hold the same vibe as the previous trilogy. Perhaps that was the point. The goblin king seemed like a dumb comedian rather then a king.<br/><br/>The movie really does not begin to take-off until more then half-way in. <br/><br/>As I stated though visually it was amazing. The CGI characters were the most real I've ever seen. I hope the following films have more substance and less fluff. <br/><br/>If your a rings fan go see it. But if not, you are better off renting it and skipping the boring parts. The story doesn't add much to the previous trilogy.<br/><br/>This may actually be the first film that should be released as a director's cut, with less footage...."

","I would like to send a message to Peter and crew: Too much of anything is good for nothing. I watched ""the making of Hobbit movie"" in Youtube and I noticed people slogging with deadlines on their head, people enclosed in rooms working on setting background music, cinematic effects etc.. This is not a good/healthy way of creating cinema.<br/><br/>The movie was good with exceptional shots and sound but it lacked consistency: the fight sequences were rather stretched with ""Age of empire style music"", you know, like ""just get done with the fights and move on"" kind of thinking. The CGI was clearly evident, too much of pixel shading and pretty dented graphic configurations. <br/><br/>I request the movie makers to be more natural, let the deadlines stay dead and work outside the studios to stay in touch with reality and not get carried away with too much of imagination and fantasies. <br/><br/>""Imagination is a medicine which could turn into poison if taken in excess"".<br/><br/>Hats off to every low fps part of the movie: exceptional cinematography."
"bdwilneralex","5","10","16","6 November 2013"," a disappointing, evident money-grab
","I was intrigued--yet concerned--to see producer Peter Jackson resurrecting the same cast of characters some ten years later to work on The Hobbit. I was even more concerned to behold that Jackson intended to stretch The Hobbit out to three overlong films, particularly since Tolkien's original work measures a scant 200 pages or so, compared to 1100+ pages for ""Lord of the Rings."" My concern was borne out when I suffered through The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Why does Bilbo not even meet Gollum--an episode that occurs early in the book--until the picture is three-fourths over? (Answer: Jackson had to inject umpteen largely irrelevant tales from Tolkien's ""Silmarillion"" to flesh out the picture, combined with rather unimpressive CGI animation (folks, we've seen it all before.) Where is the reasonably exciting, certainly entertaining, episode where the dwarfs are captured by the giant spiders? (Answer: I guess we have to wait until the sequel--or even the threequel.) This is commercialist greed at its worst. Some may like it, some may not, but Tolkien it's definitely not!"

I didn't. I never felt the attachment to the characters in this film that I felt throughout the LOTR trilogy. I was never ""on the edge of my seat"" like I was so often during LOTR.<br/><br/>Perhaps 13 dwarfs were just too many to get your head around. Snow White pushed the envelope with Seven Dwarfs, but at least most people could remember seven names. Not so here. How many dwarfs can you remember by name?

","I have read and re-read the Tolkein books many times over the years. I enjoyed the LOTR films, despite numerous niggles, and looked forward to the Hobbit with great anticipation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a laboured, tedious mess. It has been severely stretched to make a trilogy and, as happens far too often, the film-makers have arrogantly decided that hey know better than the author and made arbitrary tweaks that lessen the story. With LOTR, I felt that the changes would make no difference for a new-comer to the story and were not enough to spoil it for a confirmed fan like myself. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the Hobbit. Both my wife and I persevered through the film and ended up determined to avoid the second and third films at all costs."
"jamiesfoster","5","11","18","10 August 2013"," Hugely Disappointing
","First off I'd like to say I'm a big fan of The Lord of the Rings films, everything about them I think is just so well done, the details are simply amazing. Whereas the hobbit I feel it just constantly disappoints. They are a couple of scenes that help redeem its status but if it wasn't a Tolkien/Jackson job I'd give it around a 4. The effects are great yadayada, but I genuinely couldn't care about the special effects, there extras to a film nothing more. Like many other reviewers have said the introduction drags massively, so first impressions aren't the greatest either. Frodo also kind of annoyed me, I mean could he have sounded any different, did he even need to be in the film? I also felt the way they portrayed the dwarfs was ridiculously bad. I thought dwarfs were supposed to be tough looking with big shaggy beards and large shoulders. It would've looked better if they just used the dwarfs from Time Bandits. Half of them just look normal, if it wasn't for the odd long shot and camera trick you wouldn't be able to tell that there supposed to be like 4 foot. Another thing that really grinded my gears was the rock giants; what a boring, poorly executed, dragged out piece of terribleness. This scene could've been much better if they just kept it short and had the fight take place in the distance. We don't need to see them, leave something to the imagination Mr. CGI. Finally the goblins, like.. where do they get off? I honestly don't understand why they fully revamped them. In LOTR they looked well nasty and mischievous. You'd see one and know they'd eat you and enjoy it, but in the hobbit, they come across completely harmless. You know without reading the book that our heroes will be safe as houses smoking pipe weed and playing scrabble with these throwbacks. And I can't even describe the rest of this scene, metal bones and Kevlar skin comes to mind. I know nothing I've wrote so far is positive, so I'll quickly throw in some of the good stuff. The music as expected is still great and really helps carry the film. The props and special effects are top notch. The cast is okay, although familiar faces do outshine the rest. And Gollum in my eyes saves this film from being a narnia, they really capture his scenes straight from the book. All in all I'd give this film a 5/6, definite disappointment. Lets hope the next ones more entertaining!"

I am not in admiring CGI for the sake of it. And the opening scene is just way too long..25 minutes for a breakfast??<br/><br/>As for the story. all this gold we are shown that the dwarfs had.. what's the point if a quarter of the worlds population swims in Gold..and all it does it attract Dragons?

"ladiesbane","6","11","18","5 January 2013"," Only mildly spoilery, but a major mess regardless.
","While I admit to preferring the book versions of most works, I am not a literalist. Movies such as L.A. Confidential used major surgery to transform brilliant but impossibly stream-of-consciousness writing into a singular, excellent, same-but-different movie. It's not impossible and it's not anathema to make major changes.<br/><br/>The Hobbit makes a lot of changes from the text, but very few improvements. A scene is added at the beginning to show some history in an effective, concise way, and I understand the addition of major players at Rivendell to provide a little more exposition even if I found it boringly rendered. (If Galadriel spoke any more slowly, she would be impossible to understand. Every word sounds as if she's emerging from a coma and doesn't know what she's saying.) Really poor changes include the addition of two silly drug references; obnoxiously sugary, cutesy-poo scenes with Radagast the Brown; at least four endless, pointless CGI sequences designed to tie into theme park rides; and an excessive emphasis on childish humor, of the boogers-and-belching variety.<br/><br/>Continued lameness from the movie trilogy includes sword killing that doesn't cause bloodshed, smarmy hugging by characters known for being hard-cased curmudgeons, and the omission of what might be considered negative personality traits in people who used to be complex characters but now must be unconditionally adorable in order not to confuse the simpleminded.<br/><br/>This used to be a tale of adventure, showing a spoiled, untried person having his metal refined through hardship and finding inner strength. There was darkness in this story, and truly harrowing moments, and depth for all the lightness. Now it's just a wacky romp designed for maximum marketing.<br/><br/>They could have made a really good movie and STILL made a lot of money, but they chose to make an overlong, horribly cartoonish, Keystone Kops ordeal.<br/><br/>If you see this movie, and it is eminently skippable, pause during the fight of the stone giants to get a glimpse of the ""real movie"" direction they could have taken while keeping the fantasy intact. It's not the shifting mountains with the theme-park-ride sliding, not the New Zealand Tourism Board panoramas, but the beautifully rendered, mountain-tall giants themselves, hurling boulders at each other in mindless elemental rage. The single ""wow!"" scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Imagine the entire work endowed with meaningful situations and purposeful action.<br/><br/>Imagine how much better this movie could have been."

","The Hobbit tries hard, and a lot of the time gets it perfectly right. Character scenes translate well from the book, Middle Earth is presented beautifully, and Bilbo is great. I was expecting a wonderful film based on the early scenes. I'm not a fan of the book, reading it after LOTR as a teen I found it too cute and childish, but the beginning felt like it would be suitable for the book's target audience. However, The Hobbit is half cute character-driven story, and half CGI rampage.<br/><br/>Where it went wrong for me was in the loooong battle scenes and manufactured peril. Watching the battles, I could imagine a group of screenwriters and CGI chaps standing around a whiteboard egging each other on: ""And then, what if everyone ...."" ""Hey yeah! But I reckon it could be bigger than that! More monsters! More rickety bridges over ravines poised to collapse!"" I started to fall asleep during one of the more tediously long scenes - just shut my eyes for a bit until plot existed again and didn't really want to open them again.<br/><br/>The various perilous things that happen to Our Heroes worried me, because a lot just wouldn't have been survivable - each time someone ought to have died I was pulled out of my suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a director's cut without 80% of the battle scenes - that would be a great movie."

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the extremely highly anticipated prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is the first part of the story of Bilbo ""the Dildo"" Baggins, and how he helped the dwarfs reclaim their city from the dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>I do like the original trilogy. I think it's a well put together series of films that can sometimes be really epic. So I was looking forward to The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Now did it live up to my expectations. No. It disappointed me. A lot.<br/><br/>The movie feels extremely drawn out. I kept thinking the entire time for almost every single scene in this movie that ""this scene could've been shortened by many minutes"". I mean, let's think about it: It's a children's book only with around 300 pages, and it's being adapted into three movies that last about 3 hours each! And for that reason, The Hobbit's length feels so forced. It seems like the entire movie could've been done in an hour or even just 30 minutes. The dialogue just seems to have been stretched so far. I'm betting the writers were extremely bored with writing this movie, because it's all so dull.<br/><br/>On the good side of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the special effects are absolutely incredible! The sets, locations, characters and action scenes look so good! The movie also does a good job on recreating a lot of the same elements from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>And the best scene in the movie is the one with Gollum. That was great.<br/><br/>I saw the movie with 48fps, and I gotta say that I'd really like it if 48fps replaced 3D as a visual gimmick in the theaters. Because it makes the movie more immersive and the action scenes more fun to watch. The 3D is also good, but nothing special.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is disappointing. It's way too long compared to the story it's telling (which also isn't very interesting to begin with), most of the characters are forgettable and while the visuals are good, the CGI characters go a bit overboard. I mean, the Orcs in The Lord of the Rings looked way better than the ones in this. But the visuals and nostalgia factors make the movie tolerable. Overall, it's OK."

","Lovely: Martin Freeman created the best hobbit character so far, his subtly ironic, but also warmhearted acting really hits the nail on the head! The scenes at Bag End and the feast scene in Rivendell are funny and lighthearted moments, that offer a rare glimpse of the atmosphere of the original story. The riddle scene with Gollum is probably the best one, just focusing on the characters and the atmosphere, without any gimmicks.<br/><br/>Bad: Everything else. Action, action, action and even more CGI. Feels like a video game, not a movie and it's no coincidence that the few great scenes don't need animated landscapes or explosive action. And it got even worse with part 2 and 3, it seems that the only reason to stretch this story to a trilogy was to build a stage for the special effects (and to milk the cow, of course). This adds nothing! Also the screenplay is rubbish, most of the dialogues feel forced and pathetic. Some of the most iconic scenes from the novel got a sloppy treatment (the trolls for example), while completely pointless stuff was written in (Radagast, or Azog and the whole organised hunt of the Orcs). And how it bores me to death when the characters mooove and speeeaaak slooowlyyy all the time, to pretend some kind of mystery atmosphere. What was a light- and warmhearted adventure/road story originally, became a corny action movie with the aesthetics of a video game blockbuster."
"sagrat","6","4","5","15 August 2015"," Long awaited, much disappointed
","After being blown away by the beauty, majesty and magic of Jackon's LoTR trilogy, I kept waiting and hoping for a fantastic Hobbit movie. Sadly, not to happen. The best parts of the book, particularly the exceptionally humorous bits with the trolls and Beorn get truncated and even changed! Same with the addition of an Elf-Dwarf love story?! What is up with that, I have to wonder. Still, there are some nice interweaving of threads from The Silmarillion. Also, Tolkien filled The Hobbit with songs ... where are they here? With the exception of the opening at Bilbo's home, the music gets relegated to the closing titles. All in all, most disappointed in this effort, and the final chapter in this Hobbit trilogy of films, too."
"Deep-Thought","3","4","5","10 August 2015"," Why bother?
","I held off from watching any of Peter Jackson's Hobbit films for a long time because I was so disappointed with his Lord of the Rings films, especially when it turned out that he intended to make a trilogy based on The Hobbit. So first he mashes and squashes each volume of LOTR into a single film. Here he's doing the opposite: He's taking the much less substantial fabric of The Hobbit and padding it out until it's almost unrecognizable. The leisurely, majestic, richly detailed, LOTR trilogy he ruined by racing through it at breakneck speed. Here he takes the written Hobbit, which is much less complex and moves along at a good clip, and makes it sprawling and ponderous. The spectacular vistas and bloody battle scenes that stretch away to the horizon are absurdly overdone for the scale of the story. None of it looks any different from the LOTR effects. You get the feeling that Jackson is still feeling impelled to say, ""Look, no hands!"" Filming Tolkien's saga of Middle-Earth isn't like adapting a modern novel for the screen. Even a book on the New York Times bestseller list will be read by relatively few people. Filming Tolkien is more like filming Shakespeare or the Bible. The Hobbit and LOTR are so well known and so beloved that the astute director should know that however faithful as (s)he tries to be to the author's vision, whatever winds up in the can won't satisfy the imaginations of many of the rabid Tolkien fans out there who know every detail of every book as well as they know the Pledge of Allegiance. Jackson is not stupid, so he must be incredibly arrogant to think that he can out-Tolkien Tolkien. Tolkien was one person; why on Earth do you need four, count 'em, four screenwriters for this film (the same thing was true of the LOTR films)? What traces of Tolkien's plot and dialogue remain have all been chopped up and moved around. Why, for heaven's sake? Why would you undertake film dramatization of Tolkien's books if you don't intend to make films of Tolkien's books? The novel The Hobbit has been called ""enchanting."" Even at its darkest and most suspenseful, it's light and humorous, sort of like an Indiana Jones movie. Well, there's nothing light or enchanting about An Unexpected Journey: It's immense, bloated, sprawling, and Wagnerian in its mood and its crashing music. It has sweeping, interminable battle scenes that just make the viewer impatient to get on with the story. It has a cast of thousands, most of whom aren't in the book, and who are mostly a hindrance to the plot, or what's left of it after Jackson and his writers have twisted it all out of shape. In short, unlike the literary Hobbit, this movie is a real downer.<br/><br/>There are really ludicrous character contrasts: For example, Thorin, unlike his character in the book, is dark, broody, angry and combative; and yet the twelve other dwarfs in the company look and act as if they were straight out of a Disney cartoon. Martin Freeman's diffident performance as Bilbo is similar to his screen persona as Dr. Watson in the modern ""Sherlock"" series and as Arthur Dent in the dreadful film version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It doesn't really work for Bilbo. As played by Ian McKellen, Gandalf the Gray really is rather gray; he is tentative, uncertain, almost timid at times. And I thought I'd thankfully seen the last of Elijah Wood as Frodo, whose performance for some reason makes me cringe; but here he is, shoehorned into this movie like so many other supernumerary characters.<br/><br/>Maybe someday the BBC, or HBO, or Netflix, or some other creative organization will produce, say, a ten-part miniseries of The Hobbit and LOTR that will be true, or at least truer, to the plot, characterizations and dialogue than Peter Jackson. This film here is another leaden, flat-footed failure."
"account-184-125611","3","4","5","25 April 2015"," This is where things already began to go wrong
","The mere idea of turning a rather short book originally written for children into a, what, 9 hour trilogy, the addition of things like a very unlikely love-story, additional characters, characters from the successful first trilogy all basically say ""We want to hit all the demographics"".<br/><br/>The book originally was written for children. It's shorter and light-hearted than LOTR. And sure, the dwarfs seem to be perfect to make children giggle and sell menus at McDonald's. <br/><br/>Then again, the amount of heads being cut off, (to children) scary monsters and, in the final movie, two very cruel death-scenes which DEFINITELY are not OK for children make this seem weird.<br/><br/>Lets take the dwarfs. Peter Jackson is known for an often very juvenile humor. Silly sizes for weapons, scenes like Legolas skateboarding, the catapult-trolls in the third movie, the ""disgustiness"" of the goblin king. So juvenile. In the book, the dwarfs looked kinda similar. You could tell them apart, but they didn't look very different.<br/><br/>Here, PJ wanted more visual difference. And therefore, the dwarfs look like a total outlandish, odd group of freaks. One looks feminine. Two look like small humans. Thorin looks like a shrunken Aragorn. One has an ax stuck into his head. One looks like a character from the ""Asterix"" comics. One looks like he has a hairdo similar to that in the ""Something About Mary"" movie in stereo. <br/><br/>The new camera technique used for this might be technically impressive. I do think that the sharp focus, the specific look the FPS give do not fit a fantasy movie AT ALL. Its way TOO focused, too ""high-res"". It makes the CGI and trick shots even more unrealistic... Rivendell and other places look like in a video game, ca. 2007. <br/><br/>Most of all, this extra-sharpness makes the movie feel cold, sterile. And that fits, because this movie simply feels mostly empty and cold to me. Heartless.<br/><br/>One of the most ridiculous things is Azog. Now, even if Jackson kept referring to the appendices of LOTR (which have enough material to cover many movies, without the need to add badly-written ninja elf queens), when did he miss the part that Azog, one of the villains here, was killed years ago. His deeds started a war, and his death ended it. Why did he have to be included? He looks out of place. Visually too, because he looks like 100% CGI... a white orc with some scars that look like gills. Even worse, he is badly written. He is used to stretch out the movie with pointless skirmishes, 80s style: Group of villains hunt heroes, turn up suddenly, fight, heroes escape with the villains yelling after them. <br/><br/>Which leads me to Radagast. While certain viewers apparently enjoy references to bird poo, dope-smoking and sleds pulled by rabbits... we are talking about a char who is basically at the same level as Gandalf and Sauron. He, to me, was a tragic figure. He was more interested in animals and nature, and didn't get involved too much in the battles. <br/><br/>Radagast in the movie looks like he was kicked out of Hogwarts. This almost immortal being, incredibly old, supposedly wise, looks like a character from a silly Bill and Ted movie. Bird poo on his face, jerking around like a slobbering mad professor, only there for comic relief. <br/><br/>I mentioned this in the other review: I don't know what happened. Did Jackson simply lose all self-control? Did the success of the LOTR movies make him go ""OK, I have some leverage now, so let's make these movies like I REALLY wanna do them""? Did he really think (or, gasp, consider it RESPECTFUL) to take the writing of a genre-defining author who worked on his book for several decades, constantly refining and polishing them, loving the characters and world he created, and retell them in a silly, juvenile and tasteless way? Does he think he knows better than Tolkien did, or that he could tell a story better? Does he think that the audience is so stupid he needs to add something for every demographic, from children to teens who want love-stories or pot-references, to Transformer-fans? <br/><br/>Does he think that, after LOTR and the Hobbit are among the most successful books ever, the audience would shy away from an adaption at least close to the original, without stretching it beyond the breaking point, adding toilet humor, ""hur hur big weapon"" humor, a totally stupid, pointless and horribly-written love-story? And with all this crap that was added, it was too hard to make the eagles speak? That was TOO FAR OUT? They could have explained why they didn't fly the travellers to Erebor directly. Many people who didn't read the book went ""LOL why don't they just fly there all the way with the eagles?"" Well, since Peter apparently thought it was too weird to have eagles speak (compared to a dwarf and elf having a love-story on the level of ""The Blue Lagoon"", stone transformers battling, orc-mounted catapults, elves defying ALL the laws of gravity many times, elves killing what felt like a bazillion orcs ninja-style), this isn't explained, and seen as a plot-hole. <br/><br/>Of the three movies, this is still the best, before PJ and his team completely lose all sense of taste and perspective in the second and third movie. I am actually glad for Mr. Tolkien that he isn't able to see this. Considering Mrs. Rowling was involved in the Potter-movies and made sure it stayed true to the story, being VERY strict, I think Tolkien would have started to sob had he seen PJs idea for a book he wrote as a labor of love. All the kudos PJ deserves for LOTR go down the toilet, as apparently, he really IS the film-maker his earliest movies suggest. Vain, childish, tasteless, disrespectful and a horrible writer."
"petra_ste","5","4","5","16 February 2015"," More is not better; more is just more
","I know Tolkien fans who enjoy the Hobbit trilogy and admit: ""Yes, the movies are too long... but the more Middle-earth, the better"". I believe this is wrong in a fundamental way. Sometimes there is too much of a good story; in fact, I'd argue many stories are good BECAUSE there isn't too much of them. They knew when to start and when to finish. Take two of the highest-rated movies on IMDb, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Shawshank Redemption (SPOILERS for them if you have been living under a rock). Would the former be better with a flashback to Tuco's miserable childhood? Would the latter be improved by a ten-minutes epilogue with Andy and Red drinking Piña Colada on the beach? I doubt it.<br/><br/>There is a tendency of modern blockbusters to add bloat, in the form of irrelevant subplots and characters sprouting on every scene; this is mistaken for depth. But complex and complicated are not the same thing (L.A. Confidential=complex; Revenge of the Sith=complicated). It becomes conspicuous when Jackson adapts this slim children book in three movies with a total running time of nearly eight hours - about 474 minutes (theatrical cuts) for 300 pages, little more than half a page per minute; by comparison, The Lord of the Rings adaptation was about two pages per minute.<br/><br/>(For the record, I don't think making a trilogy was necessarily a blunder; the mistake was making each entry so insufferably long. You could cut at least 30-40 minutes from every Hobbit movie with no discernible loss in terms of plot and characterization).<br/><br/>Irony burns when a coming-of-age story/cautionary tale about war and avarice becomes the devolution of a great storyteller delivering action set-pieces porn in a greed-fueled project.<br/><br/>So, bloat. The other great sin is tone, which is all over the place. Jackson could have chosen between the ominous atmosphere of The Lord of the Rings and the whimsical one of The Hobbit. Pick one or the other. Here we have juvenile antics (like the embarrassing rendition of Radagast) mixed with lugubrious horror villains. <br/><br/>This jarring discrepancy infects set-pieces: the orgy of action takes place in a consequence-free zone. Characters fall fifty feet and walk away without a bruise; in the execrable Goblin Town escape, the Dwarf company rushes through a million enemies like a lawnmower. It's tedious and unexciting. Compare to the sense of physical threat of the Moria sequence in Fellowship.<br/><br/>A positive note? Acting, with McKellen a welcome return as Gandalf, Freeman excellent as fussy Bilbo, Armitage an effective anti-hero as Thorin.<br/><br/>Not a disaster (here and there, Jackson's former good touch shines through); just a major disappointment.<br/><br/>5,5/10"
"ikaros-3","5","4","5","28 November 2014"," Disappointing
","I had been very much looking forward to The Hobbit.<br/><br/>Let's start with some blasphemy first: I don't really like Tolkien much. I refer to him as the Charles Dickens of fantasy fiction, and that is *not* meant as a compliment. I don't question his ability to write, or his importance to the genre, but great googly-moogly, I don't need every leaf in the forest described for me any more than I need the details of every cobble in the streets of Victorian London.<br/><br/>The parallel with Dickens is even closer -- both writers have produced one book I love: 'A Christmas Carol' for Dickens, and 'The Hobbit' for Tolkien. They *were* both capable of writing a story that didn't digress all over the world... they just generally didn't.<br/><br/>So while I haven't seen the whole LoTR trilogy due to a complete lack of interest, I was very interested in The Hobbit, especially when I heard Martin Freeman would be Bilbo.<br/><br/>Freeman has rapidly turned into the greatest everyman actor of our time. He was the best part of the Hitchhiker's Guide movie, he's the best Dr. Watson since Michael Williams on the BBC Radio 4 adaptations, and he was unquestionably the best part of The Hobbit. He has the rare ability to snuggle down into a role and carry you along with him, making his character's experience the audience's experience.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the overall experience of this episode of The Hobbit is that of an amusement park ride, rather than a story. It's weighed down with stunt casting and padding. It was great to see Sylvester McCoy (still my favorite Doctor), but Radagast's expanded presence in the story interfered rather than enhanced. I just can't buy Dame Edna as the Great Goblin, and the whole underground goblin cave sequence was nothing more than a roller coaster on film. Worst of all, on the wake of that, Bilbo's discovery of the ring comes off as trite and corny rather than critical to the overall story arc.<br/><br/>Sometimes padding is necessary -- 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' would have been about an eight minute cartoon without Jones, Hague, Specter and Ogle tacking some brilliant schtick onto the story, and doing it without interfering with Dr. Seuss' original narrative.<br/><br/>And sometimes the padding needs to be cut away, like Jackson did with the LoTR trilogy.<br/><br/>Here, the padding just grinds an otherwise brilliant story to a halt, repeatedly, and it wrecked it for me. I haven't seen the second part, and I shan't see the third. I shall stay with the book."

I really can't see any redeeming features other than the performance of Martin Freeman as Bilbo. While the dwarfs look physically distinct (they really don't look or act any differently yo the humans in LoTR), there was zero character development. <br/><br/>Gandalf does a great job of waiting until the last possible moment to use magic to help the dwarfs get out of precarious situations, which could have helped them avoid the situations in the first place.<br/><br/>I must admit, I did fall asleep for about 20 minutes but that was probably the only thing that stopped me from walking out.

","After the LotR trilogy, my hopes weren't exactly high when I heard that Jackson was doing the Hobbit as well. They shrank even more when I heard that instead of two films, there was going to be three.<br/><br/>The original trilogy had a decent start with FotR, but TTT and RotK got lost in unnecessary plot changes, bad pacing, excessive CGI and the worst of Hollywood clichés.<br/><br/>And to no surprise, Jackson picks up exactly where he stopped, making ""The Hobbit"" an excruciating feat that lacks any kind of depth and character development, and instead focuses on blatantly obvious CGI orcs, unnecessary and unrealistic (even for a fantasy universe) battle scenes and all the gimmicks modern cinema has to offer, to extract even more money from movie goers.<br/><br/>Also, this film should not be called The Hobbit, because poor Bilbo gets lost in all the other stuff that Jackson put into the film. The book was almost exclusively about Bilbo's point of view. And that made it special, and, if it had been kept for the silver screen, would have made The Hobbit its own movie. However, watching the movie, you can't shake off the feeling that you're watching the Fellowship again, except with dwarfs.<br/><br/>Adding insult to injury, Jackson not only neglects Bilbo, he also depicts his character in the wrong way and rushes its development, with quite alienating effects.<br/><br/>The magic of the book is certainly lost then, and all we got is a worse copy of the FotR, with less interesting characters and more fighting, which had me ultimately bored and looking frequently at my watch for the second part of the movie, relieved when it was finally over."

This movie was such a pain in the ass that I barely made it till the end!<br/><br/>I loved LOTR and I was really excited to see this movie. After watching it for 15 minutes, I was ready to leave the theater and go do ANYTHING else just to stop the annoyance and boredom that this movie gives you. It sucked the life out of me.<br/><br/>Let's start at the beginning. The scene at Bilbo's house when he's confused, everyone is rushing inside and eating his food, making a mess... He runs after them trying to save his antique furniture... This was the beginning of the ˝cute humor˝ which was then appearing through the entire movie (scene with the trolls etc.) and which was, to me, extremely annoying.<br/><br/>Then begin the unrelated action scenes! I didn't get it, really, could anyone explain to me if, for example, the monsters made of rock had anything to do with the plot? Or any of the small adventure-action scenes that were just thrown into the movie one after another? Unfortunately, it seemed pointless so it also bored me. The scenes weren't that interesting all by themselves and having no sense in the plot, I just had the feeling of wanting them to end so something real could happen. But nothing does. Not event at the end.<br/><br/>The only scene I liked was the scene with Gollum. It was nicely done, entertaining and even a bit humorous (unlike any other scene). Also, the special effects and 3D is well done, but to me that means nothing if the movie suffocates you, destroying even the possibility of enjoying it visually.<br/><br/>I watched the movie about 2 weeks ago, but today have little remembrance of it. I think this is the biggest proof of the movie being tiring, boring, uninnovative, and all in all BAD, so my brain wants to delete it and pretend it never happened."
"chaos-rampant","Null","42","89","20 December 2012"," The narrator is under the spell of a manipulative eye
","First of all, we need to have some perspective. Roughly speaking, Middle Earth was not conceived from the outset as a coherent mythology. The Hobbit was written first, a simple bedtime story for Tolkien's own children. Then over the course of the next decade, bit by bit he stretched that into the apocalyptic conclusion of LOTR, while furnishing but ultimately leaving unfinished the entire cosmogony behind it. <br/><br/>There are two reasons why I think the endeavor proved such an overwhelming success. One is of course the cunningly crafted narrative; in both Hobbit and LOTR, our eyes in the story belong to what amounts to child or childlike protagonists—'halflings'—around which, he erects a cosmogonic struggle between gods and sundry ancient beings far beyond what we can readily imagine.<br/><br/>And because he was an erudite man in his field, and wanted next to the fairytale to indulge his passion for language and myth, this allowed him to tinker with all sorts of minutiae that looking back upon, satisfy a sense of unearthing something whole. Overall, it is a simple but powerful effect.<br/><br/>The second reason is more subtle, but every bit as powerful; the books came with maps. More on that in future posts.<br/><br/>The rest of Tolkien's creation is seriously hampered by his romantic feelings towards archaic notions of harmony (to the point: Melkor's discord in the celestial music as the birth of evil), but at least this double perspective is worthwhile and creates gripping fiction: child eyes inside the story as we explore huge machinery, and visual—bird's eye—control of mapping the imagination. <br/><br/>So nevermind what Jackson did or didn't to the original story of this. Nevermind too the obvious rehash of his Fellowship: Shire preparation, Erebor and the battle at Moria as historic background, perilous journey over mountains, Rivendell and ""something moves in the darkness.."", Goblin Town as Moria including the bridge standoff, Boromir's Uruk-hai death (almost).<br/><br/>And I am okay with Jackson's decision for this to be another epic and 9- hours in total, and firmly behind his decision to loosely expand this beyond the limits of a pretty messy book. It feels good to be back, and though Tolkien liked to regard his work as a solid saga, in reality it emerged in a constant state of flux, rewrite and embellishment—if anything, Jackson is keeping true to the spirit of it.<br/><br/>So what the heck is wrong with this? <br/><br/>Jackson eliminates the double perspective—we are never, with the exception perhaps of the scene with the stone giants, both inside and hovering above the story at the god level. The hobbit disappears in the noise for large chunks of story. The funpark ride through Goblin Town is a major offender of this: the camera swoops in amazing ways, but we don't have an anchor inside the ride, and this is the reason (not bad cg work) why it feels fake and video-gamey. How exciting to imagine the scene in Tony Scott's hands a la Unstoppable.<br/><br/>The big problem though is that Jackson, as exemplified in his Kong, is a poor storyteller, he has no sense. The film IS padded and overlong, because he has not found a powerful center, and this is where he should have proved his mettle, since the book—modestly conceived in the 30's— lacks that center. <br/><br/>Look, we know who the Necromancer is. We know at this point that this is the prelude to world end—far from what Tolkien originally conceived. Furthermore, the film IS the memoir of an old man, here's the great part, already at that point under the spell of a manipulative eye. And a member of the fellowship is the author of the most captivating narrative device in the whole Tolkien universe: Balin of Moria.<br/><br/>So, there are 6 more hours to ago of this. But, I am simply aghast that Jackson secured such a huge cinematic canvas, so rife with narrative possibilities, and is wringing out the same old blockbuster nonsense. I take offense as an appreciative viewer of well crafted cinema.<br/><br/>This is pss poor entertainment."

","As a multi-occasion reader of The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series and with literally dozens of viewings of Jackson's initial masterpiece, I had been anticipating this one since the time when we were told del Toro would be directing. I bought reserved tickets 5 weeks in advance and waited eagerly. Well, I just returned from this Unexpected Journey, and I can tell you that the journey I was taken on was definitely unexpected.<br/><br/>Throughout the film it seems Jackson can't decide if this is a Disney comedy, a rehashing of Lion/Witch/Wardrobe, or a gruesome medieval action movie. To that end, we were handed a mix of non-stop green screen/CGI action, no less than 4 be-headings (the first of which I thought to be quite graphic and gratuitous), and campy jokes that pleased the under-10's in the audience while leaving everyone else reeling. Entire subplots not in The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, or any of Tolkien's other works were added which turned the originally-thoughtful and modestly-paced adventure into a continuous stream of battles and CGI effects that left the actors scrambling for coherence and the plot careening off like Radagast's bunny-driven prairie sleigh (what the heck was that, by the way?).<br/><br/>The casting was generally weak, with an extremely-unfortunate choice for the voice of the Goblin King who sounded more like the village idiot in a Monty Python skit than any kind of intimidating monster. Bilbo's character had zero continuity with the masterful performance given us by Ian Holm. Seriously, shouldn't he at least have stumbled on the Ring like in the flashbacks from LoTR and the BOOK? He seemed to lose his accent, and with it the classic old-time British charm we've come to expect from hobbits, about 1/3 of the way through the film which was surprisingly upsetting. Not even Sir Ian McKellan could save this one, and in fact the ""new"" Gandalf seemed a nervous, twitchy, misguided rambler, far from the grace of our first introduction and which could not be explained by any amount of character development over a period of 60 years to Gandalf's 2000+ in Middle Earth. The portrayal of Radagast was near-embarrassing, I think coming completely out of the blue (or maybe out of the brown is more fitting) to any true fan of Tolkien fiction.<br/><br/>The movie had three major scenes which left me with a mostly-positive impression. First, the trolls Bill, William, and Tom were colorfully- unpolished but surprisingly (compared to the rest of the film) unobtrusive, though I would have preferred the scene follow closer to the sequence of the book. Second, the portrayal of the stone giants was creative, and in my mind, generally an artistic success. Third, the riddle scene with Gollum, although I would have been more satisfied with the suspense of Gollum paddling back to his island to discover his missing Precious as he did in the book.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was an extreme rush, which is maybe impressive considering that really not a whole lot of value was added to a 3-hour film covering the first third of a 3-hour book. I really hope that the script ""grows up"" a fair amount for the second installment, but I think I'll wait to buy my tickets until the day of; if only to take reviewers' advice to wait for DVD."

"romangonther","3","22","43","31 December 2012"," Why HFR ruined the Hobbit:
","I really tried to like the ""new"" 48fps – look of The Hobbit"" and I was actually excited when I noticed the projector switched to HFR but all this self-motivation did not help. I thought one might adapt to it but it did not get any better during the 170 minute of the movie – so HFR really ruined the ""Hobbit"" completely. There is no doubt that the high frame rates appears to be more realistic and truer to live, more detailed. And as Douglas Trumbull experiments in the 80s did show the increased physical reaction of the audience to high frame rate images is measurable, but that is exactly the problem. Some people actually seem to like the thrill but that does not make it any better.For me there is a difference between a film and a video game. In cinema like in any other art form it's all about what happens in your head. In a book it's only words on a page that can create worlds, in theater you need nothing more than an actor and a few props on stage and in a movie theater its light on a screen in combination with sound and their only purpose is to trigger the imagination of the audience, because nothing can compete with that. That is the real art of cinema: To give the imagination just enough to fill all the gaps by itself. And the more unnecessary detail we throw on the screen the more we actually show the more we narrow down the space of the audience's imagination. And that's why as the saying goes: Cinema is bigger than live. To make it more real is to make it smaller. And the higher frame rate does increase this illusion of realism more than anything else. And the more the image tries to become real the more aware we become of the all other level of abstraction in cinema, may that be framing or composition, editing or even acting. And where does this strange music come from?<br/><br/>And that is exactly the impression I had with the Hobbit: It felt fake. In the Rivendale – sequence one could not help to be aware of the fact that we are in a studio all the time, the stylized soundtrack did not seem to match the image and even acting appeared to be fake although the actors in most cases proved be good movie actors But I don't want to be too pessimistic. After all it is not the technique that makes movies, its people. HFR like 3d is just another tool in the filmmakers toolbox, made more easily accessible by digital technique. But I think using HFR effectively would require a radical different way of filmmaking, even more so than with 3D. It will need a different kind of sound, of editing, of lighting, even screen writing. It would also require a different kind of acting. By using HFR a lot of old tools and techniques will lose their meaning. The question will be then: Do we win more than we lose? One day a filmmaker might come who knows how to use HFR to make his story even better like Ang Lee recently did with 3D. But today it's clear that this filmmaker is not Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>On the contrary he does not in the least seem to be aware of the implication of the technique he is working with. Not to mention 3D which does not help the story at all but is just another distracting technical gag – Compare this to for example to Ang Lees ""Life of Pi""!. In addition to 3D and the high frame rate Peter Jackson seems to be obsessed with showing the audience as much details as possible. He works with a very high depth of field. Except for the close ups everything seems to be in focus and most of the film like the scenes at Gollum's pond are much too bright. The place completely loses its magic because you can see everything. This would have made sense if Peter Jackson wanted the audience to explore the image by themselves like for instance David Lean did in ""Lawrence of Arabia"". But he just changed the technique, makes the image sharper and puts more distracting details in every frame but as far as editing and framing is concerned he does more or less the exact same thing like in all his other movies: Fast editing, constantly moving cameras even the wide shots of landscapes have the same old cycling helicopter moves. In fact he is working against his picture aesthetics because he not only denies the audience the time to explore the mass of details in the picture, on the contrary he permanently tries to conceal important details for the purpose of storytelling. Already in the first sequence he shows the dragon attack but does not want us to see the dragon. As a consequence because he is working with high frame rate and therefore has less motion blur he has to shake the camera even more violently than with 24 frames per second to obscure the scenario So the new look of the film not only does NOT support the storytelling, on the contrary Peter Jackson fight its implications from the very first moment of the film. Jackson visual effect people and stage designers did a tremendous job but you pretty soon come to realize that it does not help a bit to be able to explore for example the texture of Bilbos green door in every detail when you try to be dive into the fantastic world of middle earth."
"macnz-web2","9","22","43","11 December 2012"," Amazing
","This is the first movie I've seen in the cinema for a long time. I went to see it because I am a fan of all of Tolkiens works and enjoyed the original LotR trilogy, but mostly because I wanted to experience the 48FPS to see if it could correct what I don't like about seeing a film on a huge screen; the lack of clarity and blur for the most part.<br/><br/>The film exceeded my expectations in every way. Whereas the LotR trilogy made some changes to the story which annoyed me, the first Hobbit movie has made almost no adjustments to the story, the big one being (trying to avoid detailed spoilers) the inclusion of a Goblin who was killed by Thorin, not simply maimed. I like where I think they are taking that part of the story, but I believe the Goblins son (who does appear in the Hobbit book anyway) would have been a better fit.<br/><br/>The 48FPS presentation really does make the big screen watch-able for me, bringing out a clarity and sharpness that is usually only available in the living room. A lot of movie critics like the rustic charm of 24, but to my digital age eyes, it simply looks old on anything larger than a regular television.<br/><br/>The 3D was good although I found some of the fight sequences too fast to actually keep up with. I'll admit to ducking from a flaming pine cone! All the technical details aside, I was simply drawn into the story and held spellbound for almost three hours. A good mix of humour, character moments, action and wonder made the time fly.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman made for an amazing Bilbo, Ian McKellan played the younger and less brooding Gandalf perfectly and I enjoyed the more serious adaptation of Thorin Oakenshield (it was great to see the sequence where he got that last name in the film too!) Cameos from the White Council members were interesting as well and I'm looking forward to seeing where that leads.<br/><br/>Easily the highlight of the film was the sequence between Bilbo and Gollum. Even if I hadn't enjoyed the rest of the movie, this was just magic of every order.<br/><br/>But I did enjoy the rest of the movie and I will happily pay to see it again on the big screen. Looking forward to more in a years time!"

This is far from being on the same level as the LOR trilogy which I am a huge fan of. Im not sure if Peter Jackson was aiming at a younger target audience for this film but thats how I felt the entire 169 min.

"jackmtmb","4","34","71","14 December 2012"," Good parts, but not a well-composed whole
","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>It has been nine years since the last Middle-earth-based blockbuster took the world by storm. It was an interlude during which dedicated nerds and casual fans waited with bated breath to see another slice of Jackson's lush take on Tolkien's vast world. Ever since Guillermo Del Toro dropped out of the production, Jackson and company have promised a grand return to a world they had managed to make so recognizable and so lovable the first time around. Well, a lot has happened over the years.<br/><br/>Firstly, a new directorial trend has spread like wildfire through Hollywood. Directors are becoming less and less concerned with the art of the filmmaking and the quality of the storytelling than with the new emerging technologies. First Cameron, now Jackson are forsaking the art of storytelling in favor of newfangled techniques. Even the most conservative of the directors such as Christopher Nolan are displaying a loss of quality in their storytelling, as recent films feel more like a stitched-together series of beautifully-shot sequences than one cohesive story. While I admire the advances in technology and the progressive vision of these directors, those particular concerns are best left to Cinematographers and Producers; Directors need to worry about the story they are telling. ""The Hobbit"" certainly falls victim to this problem. Storytelling becomes secondary to the visual schmorgesborg Weta has created. And it is certainly a visual treat, but maybe a bit too sugary.<br/><br/>From start to finish, The Hobbit felt disconnected. Sequence followed sequence in an assembly-line of pretty set pieces which neither built on each other nor even raised the emotional stakes. Was this a result of the decision to adapt the book into three films? Probably. Tolkien's story is structured in essentially a three-act cycle, and so we've been given a film covering the first act only. Hardly an engaging story. But I have no intention of beating the dead horse that is criticism of the trilogy. What really hurts the film is the attempt to inject three acts into a film which is really all setup. Bilbo's journey from comfortable Hobbit to unlikely hero only works when he is forced to become a product of his environment and adapt to the situations with which he is faced. It is an evolution that only takes place over the course of a long journey and cannot be forced. This film forces the transition. Thorin's out-of-place comments about Bilbo being unfit for the journey create an artificial situation in which Bilbo feels the need to prove himself to the Dwarfs. The results are cringeworthy. A sequence towards the end of the film in which Bilbo saves the life of the Dwarven leader is both unbelievable and contrived. Forced to find a ""safe"" place to end the film, Jackson had to create an unnatural high point in the character arcs of Bilbo and Thorin which come out of nowhere because, despite Jackson's attempt to stretch and supplement the story, not enough has happened in the plot to warrant such development.<br/><br/>The poor plot treatment is even more tragic given the fantastic performances of Freeman, Armitage and of course McKellen. All three were able to perfectly embody the characters which those who have read the book know and love. Freeman's Bilbo had some inspirational moments showcasing the character's respectable shock at the prospect of adventuring and his consequential need to become brave. Gandalf had some great wizard moments, and as usual packed a punch with his lighthearted wit and fatherly wisdom. Armitage as Thorin was everything a noble, exiled Dwarf lord should have been – however, he was tragically under-used and given trivial, artificial conflict with such clichéd plot points as an off-screen meeting of Dwarfs where ""they all refused to come,"" a grandfather who somehow inexplicably drew the dragon to Erebor through his obsession with gold, and a horribly misplaced arch-nemesis in the person of Azog, a cartoonish (both in characterization and design) villain reminiscent of a certain ""God of War"" character.<br/><br/>Of admirable note is Jackson's attempt to appeal to the die-hard fans of Tolkien. At times it worked, and at other times didn't. Radagast serves no purpose in the story except for some hurried, extraneous background information on the Necromancer which could have easily been saved for the next film. On the other hand, some sequences could have been greatly improved by sticking to Tolkien's rendition of it: the Troll scene, along with Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire (tangent: this chapter title became an ill-conceived line in the film), both strong sequences in the book, lose much of their impact when given the Jackson treatment. It does bear mentioning that where the filmmakers went right was in the Riddles in the Dark sequence. Partially because they stuck to the book like a glove, and partially because Gollum was so well-realized (he has the only truly emotional moment in the whole film), the scene is the only really successful sequence of the film. And I do emphasize successful, since a better cinematic rendition of that scene really could not have been hoped for. Perhaps Jackson finally found a sequence he had no imaginable means to embellish.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't say I enjoyed watching The Hobbit. Visually stunning and driven by great performances, it is simply not a well-composed film, and no matter how good the parts are they cannot add up to a great whole without a master builder. Jackson may be a master technician but he has lost the ability to tell a heartfelt, meaningful story with any impact. Technically speaking, the 3D was great (as far as 3D goes) and the 48fps, while extremely distracting at first, is a technical choice I respect even if I don't agree with. Peter Jackson can continue knocking himself out with the technological breakthroughs, but perhaps he should have stuck to letting someone else try their hand at the directing helm."

From the Awful rabbit pulled cart to the fight scenes with goblins, all are poorly done. <br/><br/>Remember the gorgeous scenes from Rivendell from the original series?

","What an enigma this movie is. A great movie will have pages of positive reviews and high ratings, with an occasional negative comment here and there if appropriate. The Hobbit, however, has generated comments from both ends of the spectrum, from awesome to awful, and ratings from 1-10!<br/><br/>Sadly I must side with the negatives. It may be personal taste, but there was way too much slapstick humour, particularly in the 1st quarter, but my main beef was with the physical invulnerability of the characters. I appreciate this is fantasy and makes for great CGI scenes, but it is simply impossibly for flesh and blood humans (well dwarfs), to fall hundreds of feet and not get a scratch. Several times in the movie the group should have perished to a man/dwarf, but no, not a bruise amongst them. Fantasy by all means but the utterly impossible, no. In my humble opinion this aspect of the movie owes more to Tom and Jerry an Tolkien. <br/><br/>A let down to say the least, and the jury's out as to whether I will buy the cinema ticket for the next one, or wait for the video."

","The new characters are not as 3 dimensional. I didn't find myself really caring about them. Some of the dwarfs are Muppet-like and goofy in how they looked. Too much computer animation, of which was not well done; especially with the forest creators and the main ""bad guy"". They tried too hard to stay true to the original characters and in doing so some of them were too ""wooden"" or two dimensional. The humour wasn't the same- it was more silly or ridiculous than fun and purposeful. There were some repeated actions or catch lines from the trilogy. I guess I hoped for the same in-depth characters and attention to detail and high standards that was in the trilogy. It simply wasn't there in the ""Hobbit""."

","Why must the makers of adventure-films feel the need to make their films constantly epic and weighed down with suspense?? It ends up being nonsense. Every scene is super-charged and super-extraordinary. And these endless escape scenes and fighting against thousands of enemies... It is ridiculous! The music in the background is emotionally laden at all times which serves the purpose of leading you around like a pig at a fair, inciting you to feel something. God, let's have some normal scenes with normal dialogue and story-line. Let's have a lull in the action and suspense. Let's have some balance. The points that I have given for the movie is for the spectacular CGI which is superb. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit to be a children's book. It is written in a playful style that is appealing to children. The baddies such as orcs and wargs are depicted in a way that is not at all frightening. But in the film these baddies are bloody terrifying! It is a pity that Peter Jackson felt the film could not express the playful style in which Tolkien wrote the book. The book abounds with playful humor jumping from scene to scene but in the film humor is almost totally lacking."

","VERY VERY MILD SPOILERS. YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN NOTICE.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10. It's the Hobbit. It's one of the greatest stories ever told, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Execution: I'm too offended to give a number.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is not the crowning achievement of Tolkien's. Lord of the Rings changed Fantasy Fiction forever with its anthropological depth and detailed world building. But as far as the quality of narrative, The Hobbit is an unassuming, honest story that reads brilliantly from beginning to end. By contrast, LOTR delves for long passages into desultory details of the world that are fascinating if you've already decided to make yourself love Middle Earth, but rather laborious if you haven't. Again, LOTR is ingenious, but The Hobbit is honest, good fiction, and better told in my opinion.<br/><br/>Why belabor this point? It's exactly what the film failed to accomplish. The book is simple, short, punchy, beautiful. The trilogy (TRILOGY!!!) of films will, in the end, go on for 9 hours.<br/><br/>Is there plot and/or character material to keep the story going for that long. H*** F*****G **IT B**CH NO!!!!!<br/><br/>The first fight scene probably lasts around thirty minutes. I am not exaggerating. The story is padded not with character or plot or setting or anything of value. It's not even padded with really cool violence. It's padded with dwarfs falling off cliffs. Seriously. Not exaggerating. You must spend a good twenty minutes of the film just watching dwarfs fall off cliffs. Then they hit their heads after 100- 300 metre drops and still feel fine. Much of the rest of the padding consists of things that could make a dwarf fall off a cliff, like orcs, or rock monsters, or more orcs, or some other less interesting monster.<br/><br/>It could easily be forty minutes of dwarfs falling off cliffs. I lost count when my brain turned to mush. Either way, there's probably 1.5 hours here of dwarfs fighting and falling. I'm not exaggerating.<br/><br/>You will spend a good 2 hours, probably 2.5 hours, watching fight scenes and landscapes. There is enough story in The Hobbit for maybe, at a serious stretch, 2 and a half hours. A punchy, compact and excellent story could not exceed 2 hours. The story of The Hobbit would make one of the best 2 hours of cinematic experience you'd ever see. It is a superb story, worthy of a superb movie. What Peter Jackson has done is not only make something offensively garish out of one of the best stories ever told but he's created an offense to art itself. He has made a clown drawing and called it the Mona Lisa.<br/><br/>Honestly, and again I must stress that I'm not exaggerating, I would like to see Peter Jackson punished for this. I would like to see law suits, violence, him falling off a cliff for at least 20 minutes, fighting orcs for one and a half hours. Make him fall off a cliff for 40 minutes just to be safe. Then see if he shakes his head and feels fine afterward. If so, make another two films out of it. This film is an offense to cinema, to Fantasy Fiction, to Tolkien and to the artistic traditions of our culture.<br/><br/>If I were in charge of the Tolkien estate, I'd be filing a law suit.<br/><br/>Burn, Peter Jackson. I hope you hang your head in shame for at least two hours of every day, and it should probably be two and a half hours just to be safe. If the next movie doesn't begin with a personal apology, I'm not watching it."

","The joy of reading the Hobbit is that it's a humble and somewhat gentle tale for children. Quite why Jackson et al have decided to turn it into a 3 episode overblown epic is unknown. Well, apart the extra money of tieing people into 3 films instead of 1. However, the cracks caused by the necessary padding (the book itself is smaller than a single Lord of the Rings tome) appear almost immediately the film starts, with rambling exposition and tedious backstory (inaccurately elaborated on from Tolkien's appendices and notes) taking up some 90 minutes of the pre-journey film.<br/><br/>Once things get underway we are set for new lows as the 'humour', which up to now has merely been forced but dreary, becomes childish with snot jokes and toilet seat thrones making a 'comic' appearance. Yes the Hobbit is a children's book, but you'd not take a child to see the film as it has its fair share of decapitations etc, so don't make adults sit through 'jokes' only a 5 year old will laugh at. Oh, and I daren't even mention the bunny pulled sled! More Narnia than Nazgul, and far more likely to appeal to Harry Potter and Twilight fans than Tolkien devotees, this is painful indeed.<br/><br/>All characters are forgettable with the small exception of Bilbo and Gandalf. The 13 Dwarfs meld into one and are all forgettable and interchangeable. We then have the de rigeur trawl through battle scenes, no dount in an effort to generate that LOTR nostalgia. But where in the LOTR trilogy they were epic engagements, here they are laborious affairs with no personal engagement, no sense of peril, just an excuse for a battle on screen.<br/><br/>Then there is a backstory with Pale Orc Azog, a one dimensional villain with none of the motives of Sauron, the machiavellian nature of Saruman, or the deception of The Nine. Again, easy for children to understand but nothing here for an adult.<br/><br/>We then have a massive abuse of Deus Ex Machina, with Gandalf literally being a walking Deux Ex Machina machine (just as well as his magic amounts to a few smoke rings and some lights). Perhaps the book is like this, I cannot remember but things seem far more noticeable on film. Perhaps because we are adults now such writing sticks out like a sore thumb, or perhaps Jackson's treatment of the material and the new writing just throws it into sharp relief. Whatever, it just feels hackneyed.<br/><br/>Anyway, remember to set your alarm to wake you up by the time this rambling, overly-verbous and nauseous mess has finished."

Yes, technically the movie hasn't got many flaws, but, when it comes to the storytelling, you'll have a disappointing movie with a generic formula that actually repeats itself over and over again.<br/><br/>What do we have here?

","The Hobbit Trilogy comes in at a massive 462 minutes for the theatrical cut and an even more bloated 532 minutes for the extended version.<br/><br/>That's 9 hours of film for a book that barely hits 300 pages in length!<br/><br/>All three movies suffer from the same problems - superfluous subplots, lack of ruthlessness in the editing room, cartoon battle scenes and chases with no real sense of any threat and sidelining Bilbo as the main protagonist. <br/><br/>The series decreases in quality as the trilogy progresses. The first is mildly enjoyable, the second has it's moments and the third is just an unwatchable incoherent mess.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend searching out 'The Tolkien Edit' where a fan has compressed all this material into a much tighter, tense and enjoyable 260 minutes. This version is far more faithful to the source material and removes almost all the issues with the trilogy mentioned above. I came across this fan version 3 yrs after the theatrical release of the forgettable final movie and it renewed by appreciation of Jackson's Middle Earth.<br/><br/>If only Peter Jackson had shown some restraint this could have been an excellent couple of movies!"

","You wait most of your life for the hobbit to come to the big screen. I liked the LOTR adaptation a lot, though I do have an issue with PJ's casting and the fact the script was very similar to the animated movie of the 80s.<br/><br/>This movie showcases how a director can destroy a movie by making his first consideration, how can we make more money. Scenes that look like they should be in a video game. Huge, badly conceived, parts added that are not in the book while all the drama and tension of the book is traded for pointless action sequences.<br/><br/>Amazes me that a director with 3 decent films under his belt decides he can write a more interesting story than an original book which has sold over 100,000,000 copies. Give this is miss and pray it gets remade at some time by somebody. Hopefully by somebody who, and I am certain this happened, did not spend a few days trying to work out how he could get Gandalf riding a transformer, so more toys could be sold for the tie ins."

","A long and tiring saga that's not refreshing but rather boring.<br/><br/>Till the time I saw, gollum near the end, it was a tale that was largely boring. Only when Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) met Gollum, that creepy character of Lord of the Rings I got some interest. Yes, it had action sequences but they were few and far apart. The film was flu of dialogue and a build up only. That's fine if the dialogue evoked laughs or moved me with tears pr did something, but here it was doing nothing for me, I was watching it without feeling for it, and that's where the film lost me elsewhere. <br/><br/>I am a big fan of LOTR and yet I did not like in fact I loved Fellowship of the ring so much more coz that gave me a reasoning and understanding of characters and a back story Here, we had a back story which I thought would be equally interesting as it is Peter Jackson at the helm, but it is rather tiring and however hard I tried, I just missed most of it. <br/><br/>Did I say, I watched it in IMAX screen, oh, how I wish then an experience could have been so very great. But what it turned out was a drowsy session for me as I was feeling sleepy as even those sitting beside me did. This film seemed so very long indeed and I am not sure if I would go into the next part again. <br/><br/>Now, let me tell you one thing as an LOTR fan, I loved LOTR and I expected a similar kind of experience but that was not be. It was overlong and mostly the story was going between 13 dwarfs and it was not an easy task even to remember the name of those 13 tiny ones. What's more disappointing was the climax conflict between our hero who is not Bilbo Baggins, but Thorin. This fight too was not up to the expectations in any kind. <br/><br/>In reality, the book HOBBIT is just about 300 pages and making a trilogy out of that seems to be rather uncalled for after seeing this film. Technically, yes this film had a few positives They used 48 fps as against the conventional 24 fps. The art direction is superb and so is the cinematography. But, that's not just what I wanted from HOBBIT, I needed an adventure and I thoroughly missed that, an adventure is not just about going on horses and returning empty handed, it is much more.<br/><br/>If you are willing to succumb to it and have a keen year and understand every dialogue minutely, you may find how many things were actually not needed. Like the jokes at the dinner table just to establish the traits of 13 dwarfs, now each must have contributed in any which way to help their King, but they are just lying and eating while Gandalf and Thorin do most of the job. I can't even call this team work.<br/><br/>So, I disliked it but I think many love it as LOTR fans, as they expect the finale to be the as grand as the LOTR - Return of the king. For me, I am not going watch the sequels may be unless someone really trustworthy comes and tell me to at least try watching them. <br/><br/>Giving a generous 2/5. It was a tiresome three hours for me."

","This film wasn't made for the LOTR fans; it was made for those who were born after the LOTR was made.<br/><br/>It looks like a Walt Disney Picture movie (they even sing songs) or an RPG (role-playing game) like Dungeon Siege II. I read in some reviews that this movie looks like ""The fellowship of the ring"". FALSE! The beauty of ""The fellowship of the ring"" consists in the mortality of the main characters, like Gandalf and Boromir. The hobbit is more like Ice Age: Bilbo & Co. looks like Manfred & Co, they are all immortals. And there is another significant difference: while in the LOTR the most of the villains were real, in ""The hobbit"" every of them are CGI.<br/><br/>I saw it in 3D, 24 fps but when it was filmed with fast camera motion I can't saw a damn thing, everything was shaky. So, what was the point of making the movie in 24 fps? I think the point is: if you pay more you can see everything, at 48 fps.<br/><br/>And another thing: I don't care if the book has only 300 pages because there are a lot of movies (some of them are very good ones) based on short stories (easy to find on IMDb by using the keywords ""based on short story""). I was expecting for another 9 hour epic masterpiece, made in a LOTR way, but ...<br/><br/>I think the film is more like a 5, but I'm giving it a 1 because I think that it's too much 10 ratings. <br/><br/>I've been waiting for this movie for years and I never thought that I will write such a negative review."
"antagonist117","3","7","11","22 March 2014"," In comparison with LOTR, this must be considered one of the most disappointing films of the early millennium
","In ""The Hobbit,"" the excessive and already-aged parts of Peter Jackson's successful ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptations are ballooned to proportions more suitable for a parody, and they crowd out the elements that made the first trilogy an instant classic. Jackson preferences artificial beasts over dialogue, and comically bad action over character development. There is so much hectic running from one poorly-animated danger to the next that there is no time to revel in the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand that stole the show in the ""Lord of the Rings."" Even in Rivendell, a natural resting point for the characters and the story, the script remains so thin that Bilbo, the title character and ostensible hero, is given nothing to do or say. Yet two scenes later we are asked to believe that he would abandon his adventure to return there. This is sloppy storytelling.<br/><br/>Even the return of Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee's beloved characters fall flat, their words wasted on a poor decision to retcon the Witch King's backstory. Permit me an esoteric digression on this important point: if, in Jackson's version, the Witch King has been thought entombed lo these many years, why do Denethor and Boromir exist in Jackson's LOTR, and what is the significance of the title ""Return of the King"" to Jackson's version of the Tolkien universe? People who know Tolkien's lore well will understand what I mean. Moreover, who defeated and entombed him? No man could have; we know that much from Jackson's movies. There is of course no acceptable answer, and ""The Hobbit""'s treatment of the Witch King is one of Jackson's many senseless and wrongheaded deviations from the texts and from his own previous films.<br/><br/>It's OK for movie adaptations to modify their source material, but in this case the changes make the content and tone of ""The Hobbit"" difficult to reconcile with the trilogy that it supposedly sets up. In LOTR, Jackson and his co-writers went out of their way to insert minor elements of lore into the films, right down to the the trees flanking the Hollin Gate into Moria. They leaned heavily on the texts, adding and subtracting from them judiciously rather than with giddy abandon. As a result, Jackson's LOTR films reflected a great deal of the richness and resonance of the novels. By comparison, ""The Hobbit"" must rank as one of the most disappointing film experiences of the early 21st century."
"nebk","6","7","11","28 October 2013"," The Hobbit Hobbles Along
","I don't consider myself a huge fan of the L.O.T.R trilogy but I have read and enjoyed the Tolkien books including the Hobbit so I looked forward to seeing it. I was thinking that it will be a faster paced and shorter film given the fact that the book that it is based on is itself about three times shorter than the Lord of the Ring Books. But no such luck.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is that a group of dwarfs wants to get back their city and their gold from a dragon called Smaug. To do this they will need help from a Wizard called Gandalf and a thief. For the thief they choose a hobbit called Bilbo who has no experience in thievery, robbing, breaking and entering or picking pockets. In other words they choose what seems like the worst possible candidate because apparently the dragon is not used to the smell of hobbits and will therefore not react to Bilbo. What will happen if the dragon chooses to use his eyes and see someone breaking into his lair is not really explained. Whilst on their quest they will be pursued by orcs led by a pale orc who seeks revenge against the dwarf prince who cut his hand off in battle years ago. Convenient timing.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey starts of slowly and keeps on going forever with some likable characters and some not so likable ones as well. There are moments and scenes in the movie which seem to have no purpose than to fill screen time so that this first installment can reach the 3 hour mark. There are also scenes which have hardly any relevance to the story overall like singing and dish throwing dwarfs in the beginning. Later on in the film there is a scene where rock giants hurl rocks at each other for no reason whilst the main protagonists are passing by. Also there are too many clichés in the movie (as in the hobbit who is reluctant and is doubted by all but becomes a heroic and noble figure by the end). And this all combined does not make it a great film.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes or so seem relatively pointless and drawn out. I understand that there is a need to get characters introduced to the audience and get the audience interested but 45 minutes is stretching it. If any other movie had a 45 minute opening most people would probably stop watching it. The young Bilbo (Played by Martin Freeman) goes from being adamant that he is not going on any adventure to literally changing his mind after one night's sleep. I guess the idea of facing a dragon makes more sense in the morning. Or maybe it's the fact that the dwarfs cleaned out his pantry so he decides he will join them and eat their food for a change.<br/><br/>Having finally started on their adventure the group of protagonists keeps on being attacked and pestered by trolls, orcs and goblins. Luckily for them none of the trolls, orcs or goblins can aim at all with any sort of weapon. But let's face it even if they had machineguns and artillery together with air support they would still miss almost everything and everyone they aim for. Unless they are shown in flashbacks in which they seem very effective and deadly.<br/><br/>So what we have in the movie so far are incompetent orcs and goblins with a reluctant hobbit and some mysterious elves thrown in half way through the movie (again for no real reason, but the screen time had to be filled). Having visited the elves (who do almost nothing but translate some runes) the group slips away unnoticed and the dwarfs get captured by the goblins and of course escape with relative ease and some help from Gandalf.<br/><br/>Of course there are more battle scenes with no point since no one even gets a scratch (other than the villains who seem to be slaughtered wholesale, so be warned if you are a goblin as this movie is biased against you). Whilst the dwarfs are battling the goblins, Bilbo finds the Ring of Power, and outsmarts Gollum in a riddle asking competition, rejoins his comrades and then saves the Dwarf Prince from the Pale Orc. They conveniently get carried away by giant eagles and the last phrase uttered by Bilbo in this movie is something like ""I think that the worst is behind us."" Yeah right... Why Gandalf couldn't have called the eagles to carry them from the shire to their destination is also a mystery. Probably because then the movie would have been 10 minutes long or so.<br/><br/>There are some positive aspects of the movie. The scenery is great. The acting is more than decent and after all the movie is fantasy so I didn't expect too much realism. Overall however this movie could have been so much better if it was an hour shorter with a better developed story. I am not saying that the story itself is bad as the book is a very entertaining one, but the script writers definitely didn't carry that through to the screen. So I give it a 5.5 out of 10 because even though the good parts are well done they get overshadowed by the sluggish pace and irrelevant scenes that are nothing but padding. So I suggest reading the book instead. It will take less time at least."
"ovaltinejenkins10","1","7","11","19 October 2013"," Too long and drawn out
","I have to say, I expected better.It has been nine years since the last of Peter Jackson's critically acclaimed trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, was released. And so many people were excited for this new adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. Sadly this movie seems to fall a little short compared to the others. Now the story is set 60 years before that of LOTR and it is of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins(Martin Freeman, The Office: BBC, Sherlock), who goes off on an adventure with 13 dwarfs and a wizard, Gandalf(Ian McKellen, X-Men, LOTR), on a quest to take back Erebor, home of the dwarfs. Erebor was taken many years earlier by a dragon Smaug, and so he dwarfs are determined to have revenge. <br/><br/>But sadly, their revenge consists of eating long meals and singing depressing songs for the first hour of the movie. This can cause people who have are not faithful to LOTR to be easily bored, and for those who have read the book, even more so. And so after an hour they set off on their journey which consists mostly of walking in front of the New Zealend country side. At one point they encountered trolls, but this scene, much like the trolls themselves, was slow moving and dull. <br/><br/>The rest of the film consisted of some foreshadowing to the LOTR trilogy, boxing matches between stone giants, and Gandalf saving the day more than once. The one scene that saves the movie, however, is between Bilbo and Gollum(Andy Serkis) who also played Cesaer from Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The scene had Gollum's typical split-personality moments, but also gave Martin Freeman a chance to act without being shouted down by multiple dwarfs. The two of them play a game of riddles, and more importantly, Bilbo finding the one ring, which this sets everything else in motion.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman was able to keep the first installment of three afloat, but hopefully the next two will not be long just for the sake of it. With the addition of Evangeline Lily(LOST, Real Steel, The Hurt Locker) as the only female elf I have ever seen, Tauriel(who is not in the books), and Orlando Bloom(Pirates of the Caribbean, LOTR) as Legolas, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug should be much better than the first, and with that said I look forward to this December with more hope than I did this past one."

","First off: I was very excited about this movie. Being a LOTR fan, I was expecting something grand.<br/><br/>I couldn't have been more disappointed.<br/><br/>The general impressions I got from this were that:<br/><br/><ul><li>this was more about making a new blockbuster trilogy than about making a good movie; why make 3 movies from a 300 pages book with a pretty simple plot if not to make money?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the spirit of the book was not respected; so many long action scenes were added, plus references to the LOTR story that I was more intrigued by these than by the original story.

In my opinion, 3D is mostly used more as a gadget to attract people and sell more expensive movie tickets than to actually improve the movie experience. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that 3D is completely useless. There are examples of movies where 3D completely makes sense (ex. Life of Pi). This just isn't one of them.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think the movie would have been vastly improved if it had been treated as a story on its own instead of a LOTR franchise prequel."
"scott-639-173907","4","7","11","22 March 2013"," Very Disappointing, Considering the Original Book
","If I didn't know anything about The Hobbit, and saw this film, I might have rated it a 7 of 10... i.e. not a great film, but fairly entertaining. But having first read -- and fell in love with -- The Hobbit in the 1960s, and having re-read it a couple more times, and then having really enjoyed Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films... well, this film is a real disappointment.<br/><br/>First of all, I would NOT allow any kids under about eight years old to see it; way too scary and graphic. The book in it's original form, on the other hand, could be told to a child in a way that would be exciting without scaring the snot out of them for no particular reason other than ""look at the special effects WE can do!"".<br/><br/>Let's go back to the original book: It is a wonderful morality tale, with characters carefully developed, a story that's both easy to follow and exciting and satisfying. This movie, on the other hand, is often confusing, especially if you are trying to relate it to the original story, and the characters are not well developed, if even developed at all.<br/><br/>My wife and I watched this movie for the first time (and only time I expect) in our living room, right after it came to the rental stores. I ended up getting up several times to get food, go to the bathroom, etc., and didn't even bother to pause it. My wife filled me in as to what happened when I was out of the room (special effects bad guys getting killed... more special effects bad guys getting killed... no real plot development).<br/><br/>OK, the special effects were not all wasted, and the Gollum vs. Bilbo cave scene looked great, even if the directing, acting and pacing were not quite up to par.<br/><br/>Another thing comes to mind: Thorin, the leader of the Dwarfs, looks like he is about six foot tall, fairly slim and well built in real life -- and just reduced in size via special effects in order to work. In fact, I just could not bring myself to believe that he was supposed to be a Dwarf at all (though I generally liked his character). And the other Dwarfs were so cartoon like as to be laughable, in a bad way.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say this is not a great movie, though the special effects can be impressive in places. If I could summarize Tolken's original book, in two words, it would be ""great story"". The same for this movie would be ""fractured story"".<br/><br/>If you ever read the great book ""Clan of the Cave Bear"", and then saw the (truely awful) movie version, you will know what I am trying to say about this film. The best I can think of to say about this disappointing film is that it may prompt you to read the original, great, book."
"Xarnis","7","7","11","11 March 2013"," A good film that suffers from a slow start
","Xarnis's review: It seems I'm in the minority here, but I like this movie. I don't know of its because i've read The Hobbit, the trilogy, and the Silmarillion, or what. And while it's definitely not as good as the original trilogy, it does a fair job of setting up the next few Installments. Unfortunately, at some points, it does feel bloated and uninspired.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good all around, but the standout is Martin Freeman. With this and Sherlock on BBC (where he plays Watson), Freeman has proved himself as a great actor with some good comedic timing. The effects are spectacular, and the battles are well-choreographed. The score is basically the same as the original trilogy, but it's still enjoyable. The effects, and the performances make you feel like you're back in Middle-Earth again.<br/><br/>One highlight scene happens between Martin Freeman's Bilbo and Andy Serkis' Gollum. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's great and makes you sad that Gollum won't appear in any of the later movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film has quite a few faults that cannot be dismissed. It's length could've easily been cut down to 2 hours, and the early portions of the film (especially a scene featuring actors from the previous trilogy) are fairly boring. The Dwarfs introductions were especially painful, but said dwarfs (the first five or so) have important roles to play later in the story. The ending is questionable as well, as is much unneeded content.<br/><br/>Overall, I found The Hobbit enjoyable. Maybe I'm giving too much credit because I'm a fan of the books, and can appreciate some of the extra content. I still liked the film on second watch, and I hope the next installments will make up for this one's faults."

","A group of fantasy figures go on a quest across a dangerous landscape to a great high mountain, meeting and fighting a range of fantastical creatures on the way. LOTR - 'Fellowship of the Ring?', um, no, 'The Hobbit - Unexpected Journey' or should that be LOTR1 a total repeat of LOTR1V? Yes, this time it is Dwarfs (guided by Gandalf) in search of their lost homeland, who pick up Bilbo Baggins on the way. What happens? Lots of CGI fighting (at least two too many Orc encounters, a ridiculous video game of chopping off/killing loads of Goblins, who do not seem to have done anyone any harm, and a trio of Trolls masquerading as the Three Stooges), lots of declamatory mock-medieaval honour statements of courage and righteousness, and endless repetitive helicopter shots of New Zealand's Southern Alps showing the group trudging to the destination ( and, boy, does the trudge go on slowly). Many have called the film too long - it is - but not because of the forty minute introduction, but because of totally unbelievable lengthy CGI sequences. I will go potty if the heroes fall miles through caverns again without a scratch. No, it is no longer breathtaking and awesome, but mere repetition because the script is so utterly unoriginal and predictable. And the other thing is a terrible sequence where we are re-introduced to the lowlights of Gollum who plays riddles with Bilbo, who gets hold of the Ring (ooh, big deal!). Let us get it straight once and for all, whenever Gollum is on screen he slows the film down to snail's pace. The first minute you saw him, gobsmacked, the second minute cartoonish, dreadfully one note and repetitive, and inaudible, third minute you wanted someone to stick a knife in him - not give Andy Serkis a career and apparent genius rating! What saves the film? Martin Freeman as Everyman - a clear English rural character who saw out his duty in the trenches in WW1 and fought above the White Cliffs as a Sergeant Pilot in WW2. He acts well and his character develops. There is a narrative thrust - if incredibly familiar. And you want things to happen - not watch Gandalf slyly look at Bilbo's pocket and nod as if he knows 'The Ring' is there.<br/><br/>But the final moment leading on to LOTR2 - how could you Mr Jackson repeat the US 'Godzilla' poster? I think you have nothing more to say - get a new team in with some new fresh ideas, or are modern audiences just hooked on over familiarity?"

It's not even in the same neighborhood. Unfortunately.<br/><br/>The humor is flat and overdone, and anyone who didn't drink 10 liters of Red Bull before the movie probably felt the same way. I could hear the laughter around me, but to me the humor was so obvious and plat that I couldn't even bare myself to smile. The little musical touch in the beginning of the movie made my cheeks red. I'll have to admit that I was a bit embarrassed. And well, let's face it. The scenes are so long that you could have read the entire book while watching the movie in the background. Even if you were a slow reader! Originally - the Lord of The Rings crew was about to make ONE movie. From a book thicker than the length of my forehead. They made it three. Three magnificent movies. Well maybe, just an idea - but maybe this time, with a rather thinner book they could've cut this one down to two movies and spared me from longing to my bed while watching the movie.<br/><br/>I'll admit that the movie contained parts even I adored. Gollum's Cave. This is the first time i really see Bilbo - the first time he even charms me - and it's all thanks to fantastic Andy Serkis and all the work he did with Gollum in the past three movies. If it wasn't for him - Gollum wouldn't have been half as great. And Gollum - I am in love with.<br/><br/>I am actually quite sad that this film just did nothing for me. My expectations have never been higher, and I've watched every fragment of behind the scenes material on you-tube, I've read the Hobbit - again, and the movie disappointed me. BIG TIME. And I wanted it to be good. I wanted it so bad. And sure - when I got in late at work and my colleagues asked me if I had fun, if the movie was good - I actually said ""Meeh. I think I need to see it again, can't seem to make up my mind"" And I will go to see it again, but if I wasn't blown away the first time, I won't the next time either.<br/><br/>Gandalf is a great character as expected - but for example, the trip to Rivendell seems completely like a waste of minutes in the movie, nothing happens here that really has to do with the journey itself - and including both Galadriel and Saruman seems to be a desperate try to refer to LOTR.<br/><br/>Too bad. I really wanted to love it."

","Well, the number of positive reviews is both disconcerting and ill-informative of reality. This movie was, by both LOTR and general standards alike, an atrocity. All the literary hype I'm reading must be the result of blind excitement being grandfathered into the series from the first trilogy's splendor. <br/><br/>I found the movie, almost from beginning to end, to be aberrantly campy, predictable, and empty of substance. The story lacked a sense of direction. The cast was given hackneyed, pith-less lines and the CGI department had a field day snipping the red tape on graphical limitations.<br/><br/>Most of the action scenes (and there was no shortage of them) were unbearably kooky, orchestrated almost as if the production crew was having a very expensive, inside joke to amuse themselves. Some of the scenes were contextually out of whack; anachronisms thrown into the mix for cinematic girth's sake. Even by fantasy movie standards, the deluge of special effects pushes the film into Pixar territory, at times making you believe you've unwittingly transcended the barrier between film and Monster's Inc. <br/><br/>Winching the book's plot avec a three year money-milking charade is nonsense and any right-minded fan could hopefully see the truth for what it is and not muddle it up with sentimental, pragmatically bankrupt perspective. <br/><br/>I went to the theater with nothing but high hopes, and left feeling distraught because I knew that somewhere in a dingy, wet cellar, duct taped to a director's chair was Peter Jackson crying for rescue while his captors sealed the fate of his legacy.<br/><br/>For a more detailed an in-depth reiteration of what I said, I would direct you to ""dlpburke's"" review because the truth should be read."
"AvidClimber","10","13","24","11 January 2013"," The Hobbit — A true treasure, and now the new top fantasy movie
","The Hobbit has always been the little brother book of The Lord of the Rings. However, in their movie version, it feels the other way around.<br/><br/>For one, technology for CGI is better due to a number of years of innovation. Then, each camera shot looks fuller, as if, maybe due to greater CGI, Peter Jackson had stuffed more details everywhere. That's probably not the case, because after reviewing all the work that went into TLOTR, it seems impossible to do better. Maybe he simply got bolder.<br/><br/>One thing is certain though, he, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens got really comfortable with Tolkien's work, enough to get creative, and deviate from the book on many occasions. With the help of a new addition to their team these forays completely respect the spirit the original work, as well as pick information out of The Silmarillion and TLOTR. I must warn fans though, that they do play with the original timeline of certain external event unrelated to The Hobbit.<br/><br/>That being said, it's a roller coaster of a movie, especially once in the goblin caves. The encounter with Gollum is priceless. The dialogs are fuller than TLOTR, there's no statements of the obvious like Legolas was wont to do, no over-sentimental lines, and no waste of time. I credit the writers and director's heighten confidence.<br/><br/>Even with all that, the council in Rivendell felt a bit weak, but it's the only scene that let me down. There's also the annoying detail about Thrain having a mental illness. I don't remember any such thing, he was no different than any other dwarf in that respect, and it adds nothing to the story. Those are the only negative things I have to say about the movie.<br/><br/>If you want magic, adventure and fantasy, it's now the ultimate movie. Go see it in IMAX. The 3D has too many panning in the beginning, giving us more blurs than I care for, but it gets better fast.<br/><br/>It's a must, for anyone, and everyone who doesn't mind 3h40min at the theater.

I was aware that the story and characters were going to be different but there was no need for such a different film  and not in a good way!<br/><br/>1. I didn't want to see a comedy There are too many jokes during the movie, some of them are a little bit out of their time and unnecessary <br/><br/>2. Magic Mushrooms (drugs) in Middle-Earth?! I don't think so <br/><br/>3. The Dwarfs wanted chips in Middle-Earth, ridiculous.<br/><br/>4. Peter Jackson made a movie much more childish, the audiences are the Lord of the Ring fans not kids with 7 years old waiting to The Chronicles of Narnia <br/><br/>5. Villains should be villains! King of Goblins death seems like an animation movie! ""Do you think you can kill me?  That will do it.""<br/><br/>After watching this movie I heard some people in the cinema telling to each other that the movie was perfect  Let's be honest, just to be a Peter Jackson's movie or a film that belongs Lord of the Rings sequel, please don't say that was a masterpiece or that was perfect or something like that because it wasn't . It isn't horrible too! In fact, if you have never seen the previews movies, The Hobbit is a good movie to watch, it is funny, it has great visual effects, it's a lovely and fascinating movie! But if you were a fan of Lord of the Ring trilogy you will find this one very disappointing!"

","Unfortunately this is one of those movies that no matter how many people tell you how bad it is you just have to see for yourself. I wish that on this occasion however I had listened to what I had heard.<br/><br/>OK where to start... I should begin by saying I adore the original lord of the rings trilogy. They are without doubt the finest movies I've ever seen. Now that being said The Hobbit was unfortunately devoid of any of the characteristics that made the original trilogy great.<br/><br/>Perhaps what ruins the film the most is the terrible HFR 48fps and 4k video. All this technology does is give the film a cheap 'BBC drama' look and feel. Fake wigs, noses and other prosthetics are all far too apparent and constantly remind you that none of this is real. As a consequence it is very hard to become immersed in the Hobbit universe and in the story. I'm not sure why this awful looking technology wasn't spotted and sorted out early on as it really does look that bad (I'm talking Scyfy channel bad, and it really shouldn't).<br/><br/>We then have the problem of the pacing, I very rarely fall asleep at the cinema but there were several moments in the first hour that had me struggling to stay conscious. The long drawn out introduction to the dwarfs is unbelievably dull and adds nothing to the movie. We then have some badly choreographed fight scenes (forget anything even remotely like LOTRs trilogy) as actors pretend to swing and hit unrealistic CGI monsters. There is then the finale which like the rest of the movie is a bitter disappointment.<br/><br/>I really am judging The Hobbit as a movie in its own right and not as part of the LOTRs saga. Unfortunately it doesn't matter how you assess this movie as it is simply a bad movie. What we should have had is one excellent movie rather than three bloated mistakes (the hobbit is a 300 page book remember). Terrible visuals, some awful casting, very poor writing and story telling all contribute to make The Hobbit a terrible mess that should have been so much more."

"markku-martinkauppi","10","18","36","13 December 2012"," The best movie of the year!
","This is a review, written right after having seen the movie, the Hobbit.<br/><br/>First, I want to start by saying that after first hearing that the movie will come out in two lengthy episodes, I was somewhat skeptical whether there is 'enough meat' in the book Hobbit, to justify two movies. But nothing prepared me for the final blow, that was when Peter Jackson announced that there will be three, around 3 hours long movies. Needless to say, that was the last thing I wanted to hear. I mean had the 'maestro' gone mad? Was he going to drag this little Hobbit fairytale endlessly, prolonging every little chapter into a exhaustion and mind- numbing boredom? This was the fear I had, entering the cinema.<br/><br/>I read a couple of magazine-reviews about it first, and they all seemed to convey a similar message. The story was dragging, the new High Frame Rate technology made the image look too realistic, similar to TV- production or something. The HFR took away the 'magic' from the movie, making even the sets look fake. Jackson had become a megalomaniac, making the Hobbit some kind of tour of Middle-Earth, maximizing the cash-flow and filling his pockets with gold, more gold that was laying under Smaug's scaly belly. These and other similar reviews seemed to confirm my own fears for the movie, and I had almost no expectations for it to be any good. But, unfortunately, I've never been so happy of being so wrong. The movie was absolutely fantastic, definitely the best I've seen this year!<br/><br/>First, the movie had enough gore and serious situations going on, enough so that it really couldn't be called a children movie only. Albeit being a tad lighter in tone compared to the LOTR, it had enough darkness to be taken seriously. The thing was really entertaining and beautiful to watch, every second of it was filled with something interesting to see and feel. And I don't know what these so called 'professional critics' been watching, but I just didn't see the same movie that they were describing, no matter how hard I looked. First of all, the HFR was and is glorious. Nothing looked fake, in fact the effects were much better everywhere, than those seen in LOTR. This was the easiest 3D movie to watch so far, even though it was almost 3 hours long. My eyes did not get tired, nor did I feel even light nausea or anything like that. And in action scenes, no more jerking of the images in fast movements. The 48 frames works brilliantly with 3D. Go to see it and get used to it, because it is going to be a new norm.<br/><br/>One realization that I made after the movie, is that the movie is not too long at all, but actually to book Hobbit is too short. When you read the Hobbit the book, you are left with a nagging feeling that too much of the story, too big events, such as major battles, were depicted in a way too few pages, leaving the reader wanting more. Perhaps it was another struck of genius from Jackson to make this a trilogy, because having just seen the first part, the damn thing seems to be working as a trilogy, and quite beautifully so too. So, in another word, this was an improvement from the book. It has actually been recently said, that Tolkien wanted to re-write the Hobbit, to reflect the new standard and feel he later set in the LOTR, but gave up. But guess what, Peter Jackson re-wrote the Hobbit with his masterful cinematic brush, in a way that I believe even Tolkien would be proud of. Jackson gives the character enough screen-time, he lashes out enough action, he lets everything breathe and flow free in magically beautiful scenery. His actors are doing their best work, Howard Shore brings forward new grand and hauntingly beautiful theme. And one more thing about Tolkien himself, he really liked writing action and battle scenes. He meticulously depicted the battles and made the whole affair not a small and quick issue, but really gorged himself in them, just like PJ likes to do in his movie adaptations of the books.<br/><br/>I don't waste time for acting reviews, other than saying that they were supreme. No-one will disappoint, Martin Freeman is a perfect choice for Bilbo Baggings. Perfect...period! And how can one explain sir Christopher Lee? I mean the man is 90 years old, and just went on and gave another brilliant and strong performance as a Saruman the White. Mackellen is as brilliant as ever. And Gollum? You're going to love seeing the wretched thing again, like a long-lost friend. In my honest opinion Peter Jackson has crafted a masterpiece of cinema, from a book that is maybe just above average. See this movie with heart and child- like curiosity and wonder. Be not concerned of it's length, there is going to be enough story to tell, because Jackson is telling the Hobbit like it should be told. My faith in his adaptation of Tolkien's works is fully restored. I give this full 10 stars. While the story is not on par with LOTR's epic majesty, mystery and end of the world drama, the Hobbit is one helluva entertaining 'road-movie' in a high fantasy setting. Not to be missed, except if you are one of those boring types, with a fixed opinion of what is realistic and possible in this world of hours, and does not want to see anything that goes against the 'rules set in stone of reality'. And if you happen to be the type, I just want to say that even you fantasize about something sometimes. We all do..."
"zardoz-13","7","23","48","16 December 2012"," An Above Average Sword & Sorcery Saga Suffers from Predictability
","Long before he took the helm of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, New Zealand born Peter Jackson had acquired both a name and a reputation for himself as an independent splatter-gore horror movie maestro. If you haven't seen ""Bad Taste"" (1987), ""Meet the Feebles"" (1989), and ultimately ""Dead Alive,"" you've missed three memorable epics. Repellent in some respects but brilliant in others with the brilliant winning out over the repellent summarizes these films. The squeamish should shun them. ""Bad Taste"" lives up to its title, while ""Meet the Feebles"" teeters on puppet porn with scenes that anticipated the 2004 gross-out fest ""Team America: World Police."" Jackson went mainstream with ""Heavenly Creatures"" (1984) starring Kate Winslet of ""Titanic"" fame. Later, in 1996, he put ""Back to the Future"" lead Michael J. Fox through the paces in his supernatural chiller ""The Frighteners."" These two are both worth renting if you've never watched them. Ultimately, Jackson ascended into the pantheon of movie directors with the ""Rings"" trilogy. Sadly, his creative star plunged with his dreadful ""King Kong"" remake and the lackluster but sympathetic crime thriller ""The Lonely Bones."" Now, Jackson sets out to relive his glory days with ""The Hobbit."" Essentially, Jackson's Golden Age consists of his J.R.R. Tolkien adaptations of ""The Lord of the Rings"" with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), followed by ""The Two Towers"" (2002) and finally the ""The Return of the King"" (2003). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" emerges as a pale imitation of Jackson's earlier Middle-earth triumphs. No end of money has been lavished on this sprawling spectacle that serves as the first act of the planned ""Hobbit"" trilogy. Virtually everybody from the earlier trilogy reprises the roles they created in the ""Rings"" extravaganzas. Christopher Lee, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchet, Hugo Weaving, and Elijah Wood drop in for a scene or two. Ian McKellen doesn't wander through every scene, but he clocks in more time than anybody else. By now, you're probably shaking your head about the decision Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema made to make more than one film out of ""The Hobbit or There and Back Again."" Wasn't it bad enough when Hollywood divided the last ""Harry Potter"" novel into two movies? Or that they perpetrated the same strategy with the final ""Twilight"" novel ""Breaking Dawn?"" Audaciously, Warner and New Line have gone one film further by stretching ""The Hobbit"" into three, not just two films! <br/><br/>Ostensibly, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" qualifies as an above-average but predictable first installment in Jackson's newest, larger-than-life, mythological, sword and sorcery trilogy. Martin Freeman, who co-stars as Dr. Watson in the BBC series ""Sherlock,"" was born to play furry-footed Bilbo Baggins. Freeman has a knack for comedy. He is an unobtrusive comic. He doesn't attract attention to himself, and he savors subtlety the same way that the great silent era comic Buster Keaton did. This minimalist approach makes Freeman appear far more hilarious. One can only hope either or both of the remaining ""Hobbit"" movies do Freeman justice. Freeman imparts both a sparkle and sense of spontaneity to these formulaic antics that nobody but lanky McKellen can rival. On the other hand, as sympathetic a character as Bilbo is, he is one of the few who has nothing to worry about regarding his survival. Similarly, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen of ""X-Men"") is immune from death, too. Meantime, it is reassuring to see his peaked hat. Everything in ""The Hobbit,"" you must understand, is spelled out in flashback by Ian Holm's elderly Bilbo at the genesis of the action.<br/><br/>The grungy villains are a step down in quality from the ""Rings"" trilogy. The problem is they aren't very menacing, even for a PG-13 film. Jackson keeps the violence fairly immaculate, too. ""The Hobbit"" suffers because it lacks a centerpiece villain. The gauntlet of computer-generated adversaries that our heroes encounter aren't impressive. The ""Twilight"" wolves looked far more ferocious than these wolves Worst, the movie ends eleven minutes shy of three hours. Comparatively, the theatrical ""Rings"" movies ran about the same length. Nevertheless, Jackson subjects us to lengthy expository-laden scenes throughout and this loquacity slows down ""The Hobbit"" until our heroes plunge into battle. <br/><br/>The first 40 minutes of ""The Hobbit"" feels like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" Various dwarfs assemble at Bilbo's home in the Shire for an impromptu party. Jackson plays this scene strictly for laughs, but nothing about this scene is remotely side-splitting. Naturally, these fellows with their droopy snouts consume everything in sight, while Gandalf entreats the Halfling to join them. Mind you, Bilbo is content in his easy chair with a library and a larder within arm's reach. Gandalf persuades Bilbo to join them and experience life first hand. Actually, Bilbo differs very little from contemporary couch potatoes. An evil dragon named Smaug, it seems, has evicted the sword-wielding dwarfs of Erebor. ""The Hobbit"" depicts the quest of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and thirteen dwarfs embark upon to reoccupy their kingdom known as the Lonely Mountain. Not until fadeout do the pugnacious dwarfs accept Bibo as one of their own. The ""Transformer"" mountain warriors are imaginative and reminded me of the asteroid in ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" where a desolate rock changed into a creature when Han Solo took refuge in it. The best scene in ""The Hobbit"" takes place when Bilbo stumbles onto Gollum, and they challenge each other with riddles for possession of the ring. Andy Serkis is superb once more as the creepy Gollum. The best part of ""The Hobbit"" occurs in its final hour when our heroes take a ride in the skies and scramble through a set reminiscent of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Sadly, what was once magical has lost its luster, and ""The Hobbit"" is only half as good as the ""Lord of the Rings"" masterpieces."

","Underwhelmed in 9/10 ways...

","When the lights go out there are 9 minutes of cheap-looking CGI with voice-over story telling. Then ""The Hobbit"" starts. From here the movie seems to move at the same speed as reading a book. Not a good idea generally. Perhaps that is why the opening section is there – to sort of 'make up' to movie audiences for the slow start the real story has.<br/><br/>The next half an hour is set in Bilbo's house, before they leave Hobbiton on the journey – which drags.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is Martin Freeman. Well cast, and well played. The rest of the acting is functionary.<br/><br/>I wanted to enjoy the movie but felt that the ticket price is more than it is worth. Unfortunately the production quality comes across as the level of TV movie, or like playing a level of Doom 3 over and over. If I had watched this as a TV special I probably would have said well-done, but not great. As a big-budget movie it is very disappointing.<br/><br/>I imagine for a generation who have enjoyed Harry Potter movies without having read Rowling's books, and who will never read Tolkien either, The Hobbit as put together by Peter Jackson might be just as expected.<br/><br/>For me, sitting in a cinema for this long without being sufficiently entertained was tiresome. Thankfully I read Tolkien's books at a younger age so those memories will always remain."

"nsequeira-50288","6","2","2","5 March 2018"," I should have stayed in my Hobbit Hole.
","I was excited for this new movie. It looked stellar. I like Lord of the Rings, of course, it's a great story, but I actually like The Hobbit more. I like the Hobbit because it sets up Lord of the Rings, it's a lot simpler, less dark, and it's generally ignored in favor of its bigger sequel. And I remember seeing a cartoon adaptation as a kid, which was my first introduction to the whole franchise. I really like The Hobbit.<br/><br/>Like I said, I like The Hobbit because it's simple and can be explained lickety-split. The Hobbit is just one easy to follow narrative. Bilbo goes with Gandalf to kill a dragon. That's about it. Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece, don't get me wrong, but there are more characters than in a soap opera, tons of subplots, and lots of tangents about the culture of Middle Earth and so on. I like short, sweet, succinct stories. And that was one reason why I didn't really like the Lord of the Rings movies: They were long, drawn out, full of confusion, and I always felt like The Hobbit should have been made to give us some exposition as to who Bilbo is and what he's doing in his relation to Frodo. That's important.<br/><br/>So I hear The Hobbit is coming out, right? I go down to the movie theater first thing, get some popcorn, and I'm prepared to hear the much less complicated, fun story of Bilbo and him going into Gollum's cave and getting invisible with the ring and everything. I'm all juiced up. The movie starts out great, really adorable, just like it should. Bilbo is in his little Hobbit hole, and Frodo is there, and then Bilbo is out on the front porch smoking some pipe-weed, and Bilbo is like, OK, I have this really cool flashback. So we go to the flashback.<br/><br/>I'm all pepped up to see Bilbo go with Gandalf and kill the dragon and everything. But first, we just see Bilbo lazing around his house, and then Gandalf and the dwarves burst in, and you'd think they ask him to go with them and kill the dragon, but nope, they sing and dance and goof off and throw dishes around for a while. I mean, it's funny, and all, and it adds some light hearted humor, but they're on an urgent mission, they don't have time to dawdle. Then, they start out on their mission and everything, but they meet some creepy things, and then some more creepy things, and then some more creepy things, just for good measure, and I'm like, ""When are they going to get on with it and start killing the dragon and everything?"" But then they meet some more special-effect creepy things, just for good measure.<br/><br/>Seriously, it made this fantasy way too creepy.<br/><br/>So finally, we get to the part where Bilbo meets Gollum in his cave, and I'm very excited, because Gollum is my favorite character in the whole thing- no kidding, I love the little creep- and they bounce some riddles off one another, and Bilbo gets the ring, and Gollum is angry, and then Bilbo leaves. And that part was good. And now it seems like it's taken quite a bit of time to get to the part with the dragon, like maybe a whole hour-And now, I'm wondering just where the dragon comes in, where the dragon gets speared in the heart and everything, but Bilbo and Gandalf just keep going, onward toward the dragon, and then it says, ""To be continued..."" and then it's the end. Credits. And I am like, ""What the Hell did I just pay my money for?"" Being a misinformed lout like myself, I rarely check to see if a movie is supposed to have sequels or not... and I didn't check here. The title itself is misleading. It says, ""The Hobbit- An Unexpected Journey"". I didn't know it was the beginning of a fricking TRILOGY. I just thought it was about the JOURNEY that Bilbo goes on. I should watch out for subtitles more often.<br/><br/>And here's where it really nips me in the keister. The Hobbit is a very short book for an epic fantasy novel. Only about 95,000 words. In the nineties. It's simple. The Lord of the Rings is composed of three super long books- all over a hundred thousand words. They need a trilogy to explain them. The Hobbit does not need a full trilogy to explain it. The director is just making a trilogy so he can rake in some more cash. And it bugs me because most people who see the movies already know how the story ends anyway. I saw the second one, thinking maybe that would end it, but nope, there was another one, and I didn't see it, so I don't get to see the end. But I really don't care. The whole thing is dumb. Really dumb. To set a whole trilogy off of this one standalone novel is like making an opera about The Cat in the Hat. It's just too long. Some of the stuff in this trilogy isn't even in the book, the director just pulls it out of nowhere. The movie would be nice, if it was just one movie. I suppose I could buy all three movies and watch them back to back, waste 6 hours when I could only spend 2. But I just won't stand for it. Everything about it is OK- except for the fact that it's way, way too long for a story about a goofy little guy with hair on his feet. call me shallow, but I'm giving this only a 6."
"jimbo-53-186511","5","2","2","11 February 2018"," Watchable in its own right, but it's also padded out and far too long
","Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is selected by Gandalf as the 14th member of his team and is tasked with assisting a group of dwarves to reclaim their home Lonely Mountain. Baggins is initially reluctant to help, but does prove his worth and eventually wins over a group of rather sceptical dwarves...<br/><br/>Many other people have probably eluded to the fact that it was going to be a tough task for Jackson to replicate the success of The Lord Of The Rings. Even going in with expectations of it being not as good (which it wasn't), it still wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped it would be...<br/><br/>The Lord Of The Rings films were long films, but in fairness I didn't really notice the time passing by when watching the original trilogy. Sadly that isn't the case here; the set-up to the story here goes on far too long and starts to grate after a while - I realise that some set-up is necessary, but if I'm not mistaken it's getting close to the hour mark before they even embark on their journey. The whole set-up with the dwarves arriving at Baggins house, goofing around and p***ing him off was mildly amusing, but again it was overdone and dragged on for too long.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's the problem with this film - it felt like Jackson didn't really have the material to stretch the film to its 'epic' length of just under 3 hours so he just torturously padded the whole film out. Another example of this is Bilbo Baggins encounter with Gollum - yes it's necessary to the story, but again their 'riddling' battle of wits and Baggins playing hide and seek with Gollum whilst invisible seemed to be a long-winded and elaborate way of showing how Baggins acquired the ring. <br/><br/>I also felt that the film didn't have much narrative structure or shape and Jackson had a tendency to dart the film in all kinds of directions which at times made the film feel a little muddled - he did this to an extent in LOTR, but it didn't feel as detrimental there as it does here.<br/><br/>The performances by the main cast are a mixed bunch; McKellen is always good value and does an excellent job again. The likes of Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee are solid in supporting roles. Freeman isn't quite as good as many of the other cast members, but does an OK job.<br/><br/>Overall then The Hobbit is an OK film that is watchable, but by unnecessarily and painfully stretching the film out to nearly 3 hours in length the film does have a lot of dull stretches meaning that a lot of viewer patience will be required in order to endure it in its entirety."
"filipemanuelneto","4","2","2","20 December 2016"," Artificial, no emotions, almost annoying
","After the thrilling success of ""Lord of the Rings"", it is imperative to milk the cow and get more money from the audience. So, the producers decided to make a three movies prequel (much like what happened with ""Star Wars"") inspired by ""The Hobbit"", the first novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. In this film, the first of this trilogy, young Bilbo Baggins is hired by a group of dwarfs to help them recover their mountain, conquered by a dangerous dragon who watches over a colossal treasure. In the middle of this plot, the film core, is Thorin Oakenshield, heir to the dwarve throne, and Galdalf, the gray wizard who links this plot to another, which develops in parallel and focuses on the struggle against the orks led by Azog, sworn enemy of the dwarfs and a traditional ally of the Dark, who mysteriously work in an abandoned fortress where there lives an evil, without name or physical form.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read the original book may criticize the way the film adapts it, but I'm not the best person to judge it because I did not read the book, I never found it in Portuguese. The actors were fine. Ian McKellen remains impeccable as Gandalf, but brings nothing new to a character we already know from LOTR. In fact, Gandalf does not have as much impact, not to mention that McKellen cannot avoid accusing some fatigue, difficult to swallow in a character who supposedly should look younger in this new trilogy. The film also fails to show us how much time has passed since the arrival of the dragon, especially if we watch characters like Thorin, who seems immune to aging. I say this because there is no difference between this film's Thorin and the one that is represented in some combat scenes, allegedly situated in distant past and shown to the public in a flashback. Martin Freeman made a convincing and credible Bilbo. In the supporting cast, the dwarfs looked good to me, Cate Blanchett always looks good as Galadriel and Sylvester McCoy is very funny in the role of Radagast, a character which could have been introduced in a more elegant way. Cinematography is banal and boring. There are sequences where this is so clearly noted that it removes all emotion from what we're seeing. The special and visual effects are awesome but there is a sense that it has been exaggerated and some scenes are so unrealistic that we simply cannot feel it. Finally, the soundtrack, by Howard Shore, is powerful, impactful and meets the expectations of the public.<br/><br/>The Hobbitt came after the resounding success of LOTR and its difficult to meet expectations. The first film in this new trilogy is not necessarily bad, but its far from the cinematic brilliance of the first trilogy.

","OK i'll admit i went to see this film in 3-D when it first came out and i had very, very high expectations of the hobbit, i loved LOTR so much i probably watched it more than 10 times, i also played the hobbit game so had an idea of what was to come, i think it was just too slow for me and the story was a bit over the top, a dragon has taken over our mountain we must get it back, just leave the damn mountain It just lacked what LOTR had, the sequels were better though but none the less i think these three films were a good starter for probably the best trilogy i've seen, so if you are like me and are a hard core LOTR fan i'd recommend watching it with a bit of caution for first, you might even like it a lot more and wonder why i criticized it"
"mcguin71","4","2","2","13 June 2015"," Disappointingly less than the sum of its parts...
","There are so many things to love about this movie...and yet i feel so very disappointed having sat and watched it.<br/><br/>Let's pick out a few good points:<br/><br/>The source material can not really be faulted, although I will admit it's been a long while since I read the book so maybe there are some trifling errors, omissions or holes that I fail to remember. The cast is great, both by name and ability, and more importantly the acting is good (but only when seen in context). The scenery is spectacular, as are the more obviously visual effects. The sound is effective, and the soundtrack combines well with the visuals.<br/><br/>But still, to me at least, its far from a classic.<br/><br/>For starters the introduction is far, far too long. I had watched 50 minutes yet felt like it had 15 minutes of relevant story, and sadly the slow pace and insistence on using filler scenes had only just began.<br/><br/>Many scenes seem to exist solely to stretch out the story and justify the dubious decision to split the book in to not just 2 but 3 films - all from a book of 300 pages (Penguins re-release is 320 but that includes numerous extras to support the actual novel). <br/><br/>So where did Peter Jackson get all those extra screen minutes?...I believe it's not only the method of writing whole scenes based on mere snippets of book lines, but also the over insistence on slow panning shots of landscapes intermixed with slow motion battle scenes, that overlong introduction...it all adds up. The result is 3 movies from a book which when stood alongside The Lord Of The Rings actually comes out shorter than any of the 3 novellas that make up the LOTR tome.<br/><br/>I've already said the film looks great...and it also looks very,very fake! This may be a fantasy land with fantastical peoples and beasts but even the live action segments appear airbrushed to within an inch of a cartoon adventure. There really is a point where worse is better because realism can help you feel immersed in the action. Sadly I wasn't and couldn't help but feel distant from the characters. In LOTR the CGI added the depth , here too often it distracts.<br/><br/>Because is looks so perfect it makes a big impact on the dramatic tension. You begin to feel that characters will prevail in their action and return home unharmed before the movie even gets up to steam. Every time you see someone in peril you don't want to jump in and help them, or sit back and watch how they overcome, instead you just sit and wait. So in a film that is far too long you now have a lack of true drama.<br/><br/>But what of the characters? For a start so many are completely redundant. Right from the get go (I would say beginning but it was probably a fair while afterwards considering the slow pace) I couldn't get attached to any of the dwarfs because there were simply too many to count. This wasn't a party it was a small army, and one consisting of too many nobodies amongst their number.<br/><br/>What characters did actually have enough screen time were played admirably by the cast (although I still hate Gollum who has never come across as having a real identity even taking in to account his being twisted by his 'Precious'). If anything the cast is wasted because too many of the scenes are dominated by the sweeping scenery and slow pacing - the Elves have always been a thoughtful race but here they come across as merely slow.<br/><br/>But its not just the Elves and Dwarfs that disappoint. Here you have Wizards who do little Wizardry, Orcs and Trolls who look and sound like comedic characters as opposed to life threatening monsters. I think I saw a couple of Mountain Giants throwing rocks at each other and endangering the party passing unseen below...I say I think because it was a few minutes of grey boring screen time and I may have dreamt it...and a Dragon who apparently could only turn up for filming the beginning and end despite supposedly being the centre of the story!<br/><br/>Like many I loved the book and felt this film had real potential, and yet I also feel like it has been wasted. Whos fault is it...Jackson? The studio? Tolkein? Who ever it may be it is simply too long, too slow, too full of nothing moments.<br/><br/>I've heard it said that no movies should ever be longer than 120 minutes otherwise it risks becoming a bore...and if it cant be compressed then best split than shorten too far. Maybe it could be argued that to display the depth of a whole world was beyond the scope of a mere 2hrs in which case could not it fit in to 4?...instead we get 169 minutes (or 182 in the extended cut) and a further 161 & 144 minutes to come. If you have this much time on your hands please just read the book! ... I knew it was long, I knew it was slow, but I also knew its beautifully shot. What I didn't expect was it to be less than enthralling.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>I expected an 8...I gave it a 4!"

"p-simondet","5","10","18","2 January 2013"," Self-Indulgent Rehash of The LOTR Trilogy
","I'm reluctant to admit that I hardly enjoyed, or was entertained by, this grossly overly computerized revisit to Middle Earth. The magic of The LOTR trilogy was almost entirely absent, and while the trilogy was certainly imperfect, each film was outrageously entertaining, captivating, and accessible. The Hobbit as a film, unfortunately, is none of these things, and entirely feels like a rehash of the LOTR, as the majority of its dialogues, blocking, and occurrences are reminiscent (or shameless reproductions) of moments from the LOTR trilogy. <br/><br/>The book (a children's story) is a sweet yet solemn coming-of-maturity tale focused on self improvement, bravery/courage, and wisdom. An Unexpected Journey is focused on hectic warfaring, greed, belittling the small guy, and CGI vistas. The sense of purpose, faith, and fellowship from the LOTR trilogy are missing here, even though Jackson attempts to follow an elusive template set with those three films. I realize it is not an ""epic"" in the sense that Frodo's quest is, but when the only facet of characterization in the entire film is how deft its unexpected hero can be with a sword, I found little else to be interested or invested in. <br/><br/>Some shots are truly stunning, and a few exchanges of dialog were mildly amusing, but all of the extraneous characters and plot lines, the poorly edited and confusing battle sequences, excessive CGI, and characters designed for children in a film decidedly for adults (with weed and 'shroom jokes interspersed) detract from an otherwise winning story. Here's hoping the next one is a better story with an iota of characterization and competent editing!<br/><br/>5/10"
"benwalas-367-841525","1","23","49","19 December 2012"," Disappointingly, not a patch on LOTR but still worth a watch
","I was actually fairly disappointed in 'An Unexpected Journey' if I'm honest, I am a major fan of the lord of the rings books and the films, in fact the collectors edition, directors cut LOTR films may be the best films out there, however I can not say that The Hobbit will be joining them.<br/><br/>There are several reasons for this, firstly is the way in which the dwarfs were portrayed, think back to Gimli in the other films, a brilliant character, tough, aggressive and very visually impressive, the dwarfs in The Hobbit however are nothing like this, they are almost cartoonish in places and more than a few of them appear to have been adapted purely for comical purposes for the film. The harsh, gruff and warrior like appearance of John Rhys-Davies' character has been replaced with comical hair-cuts, enormous noses and in the case of the dwarf Ori (the one who fights with a Dennis the Mennis catapult), a look of simplicity and stupidity that beggar belief. Also, with the exception of Thorin (and possibly Balin), the audience remains distant and completely alienated from the other dwarfs in Thorin's Company, they remain a mindless and needless babble of bumbling music makers for the entire 164 minutes of film, completely unlike in the books where the reader is introduced to all of them and establishes an individual and distinct personality for each and every one.<br/><br/>The film itself is also padded out far too much for my liking, the other LOTR books were turned into a film per book whereas The Hobbit (the shortest book of the four with only 276 pages in the hardback copy and 330 in the paperback) has been stretched and padded out into three separate (and rather long) films, and I'm afraid to say that this shows right from the start.<br/><br/>One of the things that amazed me with the original LOTR films was the fight scenes, how well they were choreographed, and the pace and intensity of the action, the attention to detail, from blood splattered orcs to the scratches and dents in a Gondor chestplate, however in The Hobbit, again, this is not the case. The action scenes have been dubbed down, rather than the intense action of the other LOTR films we get pushing, shoving and and rather boring slow motion fight scene that leaves the audience bored and wondering if they have missed something. Whether or not this was done to ensure the film received a 12A rating rather than something higher and therefore widening the audience and therefore the prospective profits is beyond me but any of the fight scenes from Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers or The Return of the King would trounce all over all of those from The Hobbit combined.<br/><br/>The other main issue I have with the film was the use of the new 'Red Epic' cameras that shoot twice the amount of frames per second to the industry standard cameras, in theory this gives a much cleaner and more defined picture, but in reality what it does is show up every prosthetic nose, every painted set and piece of film fakery that was used in the making of Peter Jackson's latest delve into Middle Earth. The images, are flat and plastic looking with the 48 fps giving an accelerated image that makes even small movements look like a drug induced hallucination, it is only when one of the characters speaks that you realise it is meant to look like this and it is the way in which it was filmed. I will say that I saw the film in 3D, whether or not the 2D version is any better on this front I don't know, but why Peter Jackson couldn't just stick to the same cameras he used in the other films I have no idea.<br/><br/>Having spent the last few paragraphs pulling the film to pieces and picking on every detail that strikes me as a flaw I will say that the film does have it's merits, the casting of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is perfect, Andy Serkis yet again delivers an outstanding performance as Gollum and Ian Mckellan is every inch the aged but powerful wizard he always was. Also I will say that the film does pick up as you go through and does get better, whether this is due to the fact that for the first 45 minutes of the film you don't once venture outside of Bilbo's home or whether it's due to the audience adjusting to the effects that the new cameras bring, or perhaps a mix of both I don't know but I can say that, despite the impressions that you may have gained from the negativity of this review so far, it was a good film and I will be seeing the next two, however in my eyes it is not, and never will be, anywhere near as good as the first three LOTR films."
"joshtoria","6","25","54","14 December 2012"," A good movie, but not great.
","As a Tolkien fanboy, I knew that this wasn't probably going to meet my fanboy expectation. I think Jackson doing it tried to hold true to what the book was, but had to succumb o entertainment value. At times it felt like an anime filler, where bits and pieces were added to the movie in order to make it a bit more interesting. Jackson tried hard to try to make it so that once he has finished filming the three hobbit movies that you can watch them all in order with the LOTR trilogy, and it all flows in order. <br/><br/>Overall could have been cut by half an hour or so. The filming and the cinematics were amazing and from what I had heard about the new frame rate making the CGI easy to spot. I often found myself wondering what was CGI and what was real. <br/><br/>What would any sort of Jackson/Tolkien movie review be without the incredible acting of Andy Serkis as gollum, between him and weta, you ended up feeling like you were part of gollum. It was great"
"TayAnne-Walsh","10","16","32","14 December 2012"," Do Not Listen to the Critics!
","Okay, first off I have been waiting for this movie for many years now and had ridiculously high expectations. However, before I went and saw the midnight showing last night I read all the critics reviews to see what to expect. Almost every single review complained about the pacing of this film, and compared it to the Lord of the Rings trilogy saying it was not as epic blah blah blah and so on. Do not decide based on those reviews. After seeing the film I realized my original expectations were not even high enough. Honestly the pacing was faster than any film in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy so I don't understand that complaint. Also, all the extra material, ie. the back stories and such, did not seem like random tangents but help with character development and some even serve to tie in this new trilogy with the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I wouldn't have it made any other way. Even my sister, who did not particularly like Lord of the Rings, said that the story did not drag on. Also, when deciding to see this movie do not listen to what they say about the HFR 48fps. Whether or not you enjoy this version all depends on if you want to feel like you are watching a film or feel like you are in the story with the characters. Personally, I thought the 48fps was absolutely gorgeous. It is not for everyone though. Take it from someone who is a film major in college. This is one of the few movies that have been released recently that I walked out of the theater wanting to walk right back in and watch it again. Peter Jackson set out to create a new trilogy people would thoroughly enjoy and he did."
"mark-a-yates","7","31","70","10 December 2012"," 3D and over-use of the digital toolbox spoiling the story
","No spoilers! Yes the film is long - 11 minutes shy of 3 hours not including credits, and feels longer than the Fellowship of the Rings. I find the digital/camera + 3D that Jackson is using far more distracting than any 48fps (as it was a critic preview in Leicster Square and I was there as guest of a writer). The film looks too sharp,clean and bright a lot of the time. Jackson also likes to keep his camera moving and pan past things in the immediate foreground, a persons shoulder, branches in a tree, and in 3D this is just jarring and distracting. It's not like an early 3D movie where they throw things at the camera but it's nearly that bad. The subtitles (used a few times during some of the elf scenes) also are distractingly floaty. Fire and any birds also don't seem to work so well in the 3D space. This is a problem of the 3D and the strength of the stereo picture generated (in a documentary they show that it is continuously adjustable by moving the 2 cameras). I have no real issue with the 48fps. I don't like the stuttering effect of a panning camera and at 48fps this is a non-issue. I think the film-makers don't have the experience to do 3D well unlike say Avatar where it was subtle and immersive. Now for the digital toolbox. Many of you might have seen King Kong, Indy 4 or Phantom Menace. Here Jackson makes the same mis-steps he does on King Kong, using digital characters to do one unbelievable thing after another. In that it was have humans running in the feet of dinosaurs, then falling through a chasm of vines chased by dinosaurs while not falling off a log despite it being shaken like a dog with a stick. Here we have Hobbit+dwarfs on the side of a moving mountain pointlessly involved in a battle (they're on the mountains legs) and a bridge falling down a chasm with dwarfs hanging off it. Jackson please stop these super-human digital characters doing this rubbish. It's unbelievable and destroys suspension-of-disbelief completely! The bunny sled racing through the forst - OK, I can buy that - but not it doing 100mph across grassland and not disturbing the grass... it just looked like bad special effects shots because you didn't believe it could go so fast and didn't interact with it's environemnt... and didn't work in the story. My next niggle (spoiler ahead) is with Jackson's pointless story changes. Bilbo does not lose the brass buttons escaping through a door-way and later becomes a hero when he shouldn't be. Kili and Fili would be the first to charge into a fight to protect their leader/Thorin. Bilbo is not supposed to be seen as a hero until after the spiders and after the barrel escape in what will be much later in film 2. Other critics have commented on the slow pace, I don't mind this, the book has it's slow scenes. And Galadriel, Gandalf and the council - it's slow, but the acting is good and I like the characters. Freeman as Bilbo is likable, the dwarfs are good fun too and Gandalf and Gollum are amazing as usual. The Hobbit generally follows a path similar to the Fellowhip's course. 10 minutes of history/narration, bag-end and then a journey."

","My wife and I are both Tolkien fans and met 10 years ago during our third visit to LOTR part 1. We both read The Hobbit, The LOTR and The Silmarillion.<br/><br/>We were a bit suspicious by Peter Jackson's choice to translate The Hobbit into a trilogy, but we decided to watch it for our anniversary anyway. We should have chosen to see Skyfall after all...<br/><br/>The LOTR trilogy captured the essence of the books - leaving out a few parts, and adding some extra spice. But at least for LOTR, Peter Jackson was justified in creating a trilogy.<br/><br/>In The Hobbit, PJ decided to twist nearly every aspect of the book in order to create a movie for the masses.<br/><br/>Only the broad story is followed. The details are way off, making place for unnecessary comic relief and overdone action scenes.<br/><br/>I am still amazed that, even though the script is a shallow excerpt of the book, PJ managed to create a three-hour long movie of the first six chapters... I could have read the book in those three hours and have a better time doing so.<br/><br/>I mean: 1 hour for the first chapter... I can read faster than that.<br/><br/>Only thing I liked (and which was more-or-less true to the book) was the Gollum scene in the cave, where PJ understandingly left out a few of the riddles to speed up the movie.<br/><br/>But I never noticed Azog the Goblin or Ragefast ever make an appearance in the book, other than maybe a footnote. To lift them to main characters, in my humble opinion, shows that they wanted this to become a Trilogy in order to steal our money.<br/><br/>Lifting Bilbo to heroic status by the end of the movie feels awkward as well... what is there left to achieve in the other two movies? Most of the budget must have gone into funding the 3D hype by the way, because CGI was awful, as was make-up on some of the dwarfs."

However the slow pace and the hokey characterization really causes a lot of problems.<br/><br/>Of course, this movie has all the Lord of the Ring grand scale... as expected. That and the fact that the characters are likable and the story watchable means it can't get anything lower than 7 out of 10.

Practically a Tom & Jerry movie. Tom & Jerry are fine, but mixing their genre with Tolkien is just stupid and awkward.

"CapnDred","5","12","23","28 December 2012"," Unbalanced but mostly enjoyable
","The Hobbit: One of the oddest films I've seen. To start with it couldn't settle on a tone between dark fantasy epic, and annoyingly broad slapstick comedy with two musical numbers in the first hour. It was irritating to me.<br/><br/>The way it's filmed is unusual. While it's clear it has a massive budget, it oftentimes looked like a fantasy TV show at best, and an FMV scene from a mid-90s PC game at worst. It somehow looked cheap - and not just because the High Frame Rate shone a harsh spotlight on the CGI as I'd heard. I thought the CGI held up mostly fine. Something about the framing and acting seemed TV soap-opera-ish. This, coupled with slow pacing at the start meant I found the first hour and a half quite difficult to sit through. However, all of these things seemed to improve as the film went on. <br/><br/>The 3D and high frame rate is very immersive and worth the extra dollar I'd say. It sometimes felt like watching live actors - particularly when they appeared about life-sized on screen. Maybe this is why I think it looked cheap.<br/><br/>That said, I really appreciate that this looks and feels different to any other film I've seen. It had sections that looked gorgeous and breath-taking, and I suspect its style will be aped and that this film will, in years to come, have shaped film-making forever.<br/><br/>I don't remember the book well enough, but this film does not have much by way of character development, even for Bilbo. There are too many characters in it to become attached to any of them on any real level, and far too many handy coincidences and obvious set ups. For example, Thorin doesn't accept Bilbo until that same Bilbo that has complained about not being ready for this journey, the same Bilbo that has never handled a sword, somehow becomes a mighty warrior just when it would be handy. That's not well-written drama, it's lazy writing. Whether it's on Tolkien's part or the film-makers', I don't know. Also, the sense of peril wears off as the film goes on, and several of the main characters have taken falls and beatings and cookings and squashings with narry a scratch. As the film goes on, these characters seem more and more immortal and that just means that as the film goes on, each next moment of suspense or peril loses more of its edge. As the characters fall down a ravine, you know that no matter how many rocks they bounce off on the way down, they'll just dust themselves off at the bottom. The film felt over-stuffed. Bits are added in from Tolkien's other works and to me they felt added in and superfluous. They didn't gel in with the main story and felt like so much padding. I couldn't decide whether they felt a bit too smug in a ""Look how much of Middle-Earth we can fit in!"" way, or greedy in a ""Look how many films we can squeeze out of making a film ostensibly based on one popular book!"" sort of way.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I liked it, though not as much or as immediately as The Fellowship of the Ring. I enjoyed it for the visual spectacle but I think the character development, plotting, pacing, and dialogue could do with some work."
"wm17959","2","19","40","19 December 2012"," I hated this!
","A few days ago I saw this movie and I hated it. About half way through I was planning on just walking out, but I felt self-conscious because I was near the front of the audience, so I waited for a darker scene, but it never came. What a stupid movie! I think the original trilogy of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" is the greatest film ever made. I have the extended box set with the behind the scenes features and I love it, but this new movie was a real let-down.<br/><br/>I never read the book, but I cannot believe that Tolkien could write such crap! It was like Jim Henson meets Disney/Pixar. The scrips played like it was written by a Hollywood sit-com writer because it lacked all the depth of the original trilogy. Everything moved too fast, the sound-track had an 'in-your-face' feel to it, and there was never any real 'tension' in the story. It was a bunch of dwarfs on a ridiculous 'George Lucas' adventure where the 'danger' never really felt real because nobody ever got hurt and you just knew all along that everyone would be just fine in the end. It was like they took elements of the original trilogy and felt the need to 'explain in more detail' so we would have a deeper understanding, but I liked the way it was before. I hated the beginning scene with the dwarfs all ignoring Bilbo in his home and being total pigs. I hated the trolls trying to cook the dwarfs and the whole 'snot' scene. The wizard with bird-sh!t on his head. That gross character in the end with the beard of fat, the talking Ork lord that looked like it came right out of some made-for-TV vampire series. And why does Bilbo find the ring differently in this movie? At the end of it, during that stupid pine-cone scene, I was expecting those trees to start walking around. They brought back every other character so why not that.<br/><br/>It was a waste of time and money and I can't believe that the key producers like Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh were at the head of this. Obviously they are now appealing to an audience devoid of any intellect. Don't go to this movie!"
"devans162","4","8","14","24 January 2013"," A Drawn-out Mess Instead of an Epic Adventure
","The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) movie trilogy ranks among my all-time favorite movies and I had been eagerly awaiting The Hobbit ever since I heard that Peter Jackson (the director of the LOTR trilogy) would be directing The Hobbit. What a let down! It seems as if Peter Jackson is trying to force LOTR fans to buy 3 tickets instead of 1 or 2, and did this through unnecessary inflation of what should not have been a lengthy epic movie. This bloat may be the worst of several problems afflicting the movie.<br/><br/>Excessive length. I own the extra-long DVD version of the LOTR trilogy and I just love it. It is 11.3 hours long, and it omitted two major sub-plots from the written LOTR. Had these two sub-plots been included in the extra-long DVD movie trilogy, the resulting length would probably have been about 12.5 hours. The Hobbit book is a little over 25% as long as the LOTR book trilogy. This would equate to maybe 3.5 hours for a movie that covers the written Hobbit thoroughly. With some additional, made-up material, it might be reasonable to get to 2 movies of a little over 2 hours each. Unfortunately, the first of three Hobbit movies is almost three hours long. The movie contains lots of overly long scenes plus many unnecessary scenes. The movie begins with a brief scene of an elderly Bilbo describing his great adventure to an unseen Frodo. This is OK and provides continuity with the LOTR movie trilogy. The movie then shifts to a roughly ten-minute depiction of a dragon taking over the mountain home of the dwarfs. This scene is completely unnecessary and corresponds to a fraction of a page in the book, when the dwarfs told Bilbo that a dragon had evicted them from their home. The movie then shifts back to a scene with Bilbo and Frodo talking the day before Bilbo's birthday party at the beginning of the LOTR. This scene could have been combined with the opening scene, and shortened, or maybe omitted. The movie then shows the arrival of Gandalf and the dwarfs at Bilbo's home. The movie turns a few pages in the book into a plodding 30+ minutes of meaningless blather and bad humor. This whole scene could have been done well in 15 minutes. This pattern repeats itself throughout the movie. In particular, every action sequence in the book gets drawn out interminably in the movie, with the number of implausible escapes multiplied by a factor of five or more. Moreover, the movie adds unnecessary and extraneous sub-plots not present in the book, including the entire interlude with the wizard Radagast, the battle with the orcs just before Bilbo and his companions reach Rivendell, and the grudge between Thorin and the orc Azog.<br/><br/>Boring/disgusting slapstick humor. The movie makes most of the dwarfs look bizarre, and there is lots of slapstick humor, much of it involving snot. None of this was in the book. Either make The Hobbit into a children's movie, along the lines of the book, or make it into serious drama, like the LOTR movie trilogy. This bizarre combination of drama, wild action scenes, and juvenile humor is ineffective.<br/><br/>Ridiculous escapes and chases. The entire interlude with the wizard Radagast (who appeared very briefly in the written LOTR, but not in the written Hobbit or the movie LOTR) and his racing rabbits, is utterly preposterous. Moreover, every action scene in the movie involves several one-in-a-million escapes. Every character in the movie, except maybe Gandalf, should have been killed about five times. I was not expecting a ""Saving Private Ryan"" level of realism, but this is so ridiculous as to be boring.<br/><br/>Computer animation. Computer animation added brilliantly to the LOTR movie trilogy, and was very effective in some recent fantasy movies, like ""John Carter."" Unfortunately, much of the Hobbit seems to exist to justify computer animation, rather than having computer animation serve the greater good of the overall story. Much of The Hobbit seems more like a video game than an actual movie.<br/><br/>Lack of character development. The characters in the LOTR movie trilogy were well developed and seemed very real. Some of them, like Boromir, had considerable complexity. Despite the great length of The Hobbit (about 2 minutes for every page in the portion of the book that the movie covered), most of the characters are one-dimensional or not developed at all."
"dosk-582-614741","5","8","14","15 January 2013"," An expected money-spinner
","Those who thought Christopher Tolkien had a very deep economic interest in his father's heritage (Sell-a-million) can officially claim that Peter Jackson has now outdone him, and by far. In a way it should have been expected. Turning a naive and simple children story into a film trilogy would require excellent writing, major creative genius and a concept at least half as good as the one in LOTR. None of these can be found here. But the lust for profit is obvious. The film has a ridiculously long beginning, is terribly written, the plot is hacked into a series of unrelated events resulting in a total lack of flow. The prolonged scenes at battlefields seem to scream 'come on guys, keep it up five more minutes and we'll get us our trilogy' and at one point, when the dwarfs' troops rally in battle and run back to face their opponents there is an unbelievable Baywatch back-flash, though admittedly with the bonus of Richard Armitage instead of Hasselhof. Why five stars? For Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman. With the best wishes that once this is over they will still be in the running for the parts that they truly deserve and not such junk."
"info-7897","3","8","14","5 January 2013"," Disappointing
","It was always clear that THE HOBBIT, being by far the lesser book, would also make the lesser movie. It simply lacks the depth, the drama, the humanity, the strong characters, and relationships of LOTR. I had already been surprised by the fact that this lovely, but relatively short and rather one-dimensional book was to be made into not one but three movies. However, nothing had prepared me for this disappointment. The storytelling is tedious and the dialog often seems rather forced. The actors are good and do a decent, sometimes even a great job – especially Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, and the ever brilliant Andy Serkis. But most of the time they seem to be in want of a decent script and inspired direction. Furthermore, I thoroughly disliked the look of the film. I had expected the Hobbit to be as visually stunning as the three LOTR-movies, maybe even more so. No such luck. While in the former films, they had managed beautifully to make CGI seem real and believable, now even the real photography looks artificial and rather cheap. The high-definition robs the images of their magic and makes them look – at least in my perception - like low budget student productions that could not afford a decent movie camera. Maybe I am just too old for this video-game look, but I really hope this is not the future of film-photography. Of course the film does have its moments and is not a full let down. A great cast, a great score, some nice ideas. But I am still very much in doubt if I will watch the next two installments."
"doodle6812","3","28","64","23 December 2012"," Disappointed all around
","This was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I have read all of the LOTR books and the Hobbit. The Hobbit was by far my favorite book of all of them because I felt is had so much ADVENTURE in it. After seeing all of the LOTR movies multiple times in the theater, I was looking forward and had high expectations for the Hobbit. LOTR was a beautiful trilogy that stayed true to the books as best they could. I didn't even mind the length of each movie because there was so much information over three books that had to be included.<br/><br/>I strongly feel that this movie could have been an awesome 3 hour movie without part 2 and 3. However, I the movie industry has become too greedy with making books into 2, and now 3, part movies when it is very unnecessary. I blame the movie makers behind Harry Potter. Don't get me wrong - I love the HP books and movies and I truly believe they did a good job with the last two HP movies. However, with making a 2 part ending, they have now set a standard that all movies that are created from a well loved book series must also do the same - Twilight, Hunger Games, etc.<br/><br/>With the Hobbit, I have never been so angry with a movie before. They added in events that just did not happen. Most times, the writers might leave out a favorite scene because it just does not transpose well onto the big screen. But with the Hobbit they did the opposite and added in events and scenes that just did not happen. Honestly, this movie bored me. You can bet that when part 2 and 3 come out I will not be spending $14+ to go see it in the theater. I will wait until I can see it on TV for free. It's not even worth the price of the DVD or Blue Ray.<br/><br/>Shame on Peter Jackson and all those associated with this movie for becoming so greedy as to ruin a classic adventure."
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","3","21","46","14 December 2012"," Too Much Bread
","In LORD OF THE RINGS, the old Bilbo compares wearing the ring – and the weight it bore upon his soul – as butter stretched onto too much bread. That's exactly what director Peter Jackson does to THE HOBBIT, at least judging by this overlong first outing of three completed films.<br/><br/>As a novel, THE HOBBIT can be described either as a lightweight alternative to THE LORD OF THE RINGS or a nice light snack before a big meal. Turning it into a sprawling epic, Jackson piles way too much exposition and backstory: including a revenge tale involving a gigantic one-armed Orc with the expressions of an infamous professional wrestler.<br/><br/>The most exciting parts of the book seem placed within THE UNEXPECTED JOURNEY as peripheral action sequences between tedious bouts of dialog and a few horrific songs. A meeting in Rivendale, where the top brass discuss what's to come, is overlong and boring, while the presence of Saruman is meaningless: he was needed much more in RETURN OF THE KING where doesn't show up at all.<br/><br/>As the title character, Martin Freeman looks perfect as Bilbo Baggins, the uptight Hobbit hired as a ""burglar"" to join a band of Dwarfs to reclaim a stolen treasure. His delivery of lines seems more befitting a modern comedy than the fantastical Middle Earth. Yet when the stakes are raised and he puts his neurosis aside, Bilbo comes alive. But he's not a character to truly invest in especially in the shadow of Elijah Wood's Frodo. While he's supposed to be reluctant to join in on the adventure, he underplays his hand and never seems the most important part of a story bearing his name. <br/><br/>It's the dwarf Thorin who gets (and earns) most of the attention, obviously intended as the new Aragorn – with a long brooding face and the bravado of an intrepid hero, he's the one to root for. Thorin alone carries the honor of the dwarfs and the basic plot to get their riches back from a dragon. Even in Tolkien's book, all the dwarf names get dizzying and it's hard to center on anyone else. And while Richard Armitage does his best to shine, he has too many distractions to compete with.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen's noticeably aged Gandalf provides so many 11th hour rescues, there's little suspense on how the antagonists will get out of each predicament. He's like that BOMB button on the video game that provides a much too easy out.<br/><br/>The best scenes involve the gang escaping from inside an Orc mountain, and then going up against a pack of ferocious (though much too computerized) wolves. Although the Orc King, who looks somewhat menacing, has a comically sarcastic voice, distracting from what should be a formidable creature He seems more apt to deliver a standup routine than end lives.<br/><br/>And this is the problem throughout much of the film: an awkward balancing act between a children's movie and a gruesome bloody epic. Even the meat eating Troll trio, kickstarting the book's action, come across as The Three Stooges here.<br/><br/>The ""Riddles in the Dark"" segment, technically the most important, where Bilbo finds the ring in Gollum's murky lair as they trade riddles back and forth, is completely wasted thanks to Gollum's hard to understand delivery of either the riddles or the answers. Andy Serkis (and the special effects team) overacts the writhing creature to an embarrassing level. Martin Freeman tries hard to make the scene as important as it should be – but he's competing with a hyperactive cartoon.<br/><br/>Who knows, maybe THE HOBBIT trilogy will improve after this mess. Based on a delicious book replete with nonstop adventures, our heroes should escape more deadly obstacles rather than wallowing in pretentious melodrama backed by searing music that, even during cool fight scenes, is way too deep and operatic.<br/><br/>Since LORD OF THE RINGS was broken into three movies just like THE HOBBIT, perhaps it should have been nine: three films for each volume. Sure, that would have been much too much information. Exactly the problem here <br/><br/>It's apparent Peter Jackson is too close to the material. If another director took a stab at THE HOBBIT, it may have turned out more of a solitary adventure rather than a desperate attempt to glue one long saga together.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
"harpreetc","10","15","31","15 December 2012"," ""Where to begin? Let's seeAh yes""
","I've been waiting since 2003 with a hope that someday Peter Jackson would direct The Hobbit. And nearly a decade after I saw The Return of the King in the theatre, I went back to see Middle-earth on the big screen.<br/><br/>Was it worth it? Oh – my – God, yes! <br/><br/>Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>The movie begins with ""dear Frodo"" and I smiled. Ian Holm is back as the older Bilbo and he rocks the prologue. The tying-up of The Hobbit to LotR begins right here – and it's done so well! The make-up is spectacular. <br/><br/>The entry of Frodo brings back wonderful memories and, ironically, it takes you into the future and yet fills you with the wonder of the present. The links between the LotR movies and this one is most prevalent in the scenes with the older Bilbo and Frodo. For instance, links of dialogues like ""dwarf doors are invisible when closed"" said by Gandalf – who, pauses and realizes that since he is seated amongst 13 dwarfs it would be quite pertinent not to mention 'even their masters cannot find them'. Or one of the trolls saying, ""make him squeal"". Or Gandalf telling Thorin to not talk at all with the elves and let him do all the talking, just like he did with Pippin in the RotK.<br/><br/>Bilbo's prologue takes us to Erebor. The Heart of the Mountain is shown – and it's unlike anything I pictured when I read about it, which doesn't mean that it is bad. It just takes on a different image now in my mind. A quite beautiful one. Thror is resplendently shown – and we get to see Thrain, Thorin and Thranduil all in the flashback. Spectacular halls. Brilliant mines. Magnificent treasure. And the need that arises withing Thror to hoard it all. Possessiveness and greed – which brings me to Smaug, the Magnificent! His arrival is shown very cleverly. A flash of a wing here, a swirl of the tail, a stride of the front legs there – but that is all that Peter Jackson gives us. Sir Ian McKellen carries the role of Gandalf with such élan that a few extra wrinkles can promptly get unnoticed. His acting, comic style, a flair for dialogue rendering make him superlative by default.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the younger Bilbo – Martin Freeman. He is just astounding! The role of Bilbo was made for this Free man! I think he has done a truly splendid job. The unsociable, very human Bilbo taking on the mantle of an intrepid adventurer who faces his own fears is amply brought to life by Martin.<br/><br/>The dwarfs are introduced well. There are 13 of them and there's no pressure to learn any of their names which is a good move on Jackson's part. Each of them is easily identifiable as different from the other by makeup and prosthesis – my favourite happens to be Balin. Thorin's entry and his personality marks him the Aragorn of The Aragorn of The Hobbit. His is a brooding personality completely befitting Thorin's and he is handsome, as are his nephews, Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Kili (Aidan Turner). Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili and Bofur are given ample screen time. The cinematography and the story boarding are just amazing. <br/><br/>Radagast the Brown, quirky, devoted to the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, is brought to life by Sylvester McCoy. I think he did a fantastic job of being the quirky, brave, eccentric passionate lover of nature that Radagast is  I enjoyed his fight with the Witch King at Dol Guldur and quite liked the rabbits from Rhosgobel, too. And yes, they are fast!<br/><br/>What is Peter Jackson's own invention is the Morgul blade that Radagast manages to wrestle from the Witch King. But even that fits into the storyline – it is well-woven in. <br/><br/>Also the fact that he gives an animal lover like me a chance to sigh with relief. Jackson allows the ponies to go 'missing' before the dwarfs reach Rivendell. I didn't want to see the ponies being taken by the goblins in Moria. <br/><br/>Galadriel, Saruman, Elrond and Gandalf have the meeting of the White Councl. Círdan, Glorfindel and Radagast are not shown in the film. Cate Blanchett is a goddess! It is here that Gandalf says the most poignant dialogue in the whole movie about how it is not great power that changes the world but small acts of kindness and love.<br/><br/>Apart from tricky action sequences in Goblin town, what is essential and really worthwhile to note is the scene with Gollum and Bilbo. The scene between the two is electrifying. Andy Serkis as Gollum has surpassed himself yet again! The execution of the Riddles in the Dark is amazing. And the finding of the Ring of Power heightens the entire situation to electrifying levels. It is diffused only between what I know now to be my favourite scene of the movie: the point where Bilbo has a choice – to kill Gollum or to spare him. ""The pity of Bilbo will rule the fate of many."" The surrealism of that scene is tackled beautifully.<br/><br/>The movie ends with a thrush and the awakening of Smaug – the look of the dragon's head, graphically, was not pleasing, it looked unreal. I hope they rectify this within a year before they show him in full, golden scales and all!<br/><br/>10 out of 5."
"kosmasp","7","7","12","5 July 2013"," The Ring: Beginning
","I never came around to read the LotR books before watching the movies and I actually haven't done that until now (so maybe shame on me), but I did read 30-40 pages of the Hobbit. And it seems, like almost everyone of those pages turns out to be in the movie. It's a big scene and it feels like Peter Jackson put almost everything in it. He apparently also put other Tolkien related stuff in it.<br/><br/>Which he must have done, because how could you make 3 movies/parts out of one book? That is smaller in size than the original Rings trilogy that is. But what about the movie? It feels fun and it looks good (once you get used to the HD framing, which makes a few props look very plastic). Also the very HD 3D (or should I say the extra FPS) we got served made the movie feel like it was on fast forward. I think your eyes have to get used to that (in comparison to normal frames per Second that every other movie uses).<br/><br/>Apart from the technical point of view, this is a well made movie, but it never completely touched me. It is well played and it has the beginning of a great adventure, but it feels a bit over bloated. I will obviously watch the other parts too and I'm pretty sure they will up the ante"
"zacquid9","Null","7","12","29 April 2013"," I really was looking forward to The Hobbit
","Oh my! What an unexpected disappointment.<br/><br/>I'm a lifelong Tolkien fan (61 years now) and was a tad sceptical when the 1st LOTR films was released. I saw it 3 times in the cinema. Three and four times for the next two respectively.<br/><br/>I really was looking forward to The Hobbit, really, I was.<br/><br/>The 1st 5-10 minutes were quite adequate and enjoyable, after that it dropped into a depth of boredom the like of which I have never before come across. I fell asleep. However, I snore and my wife awoke me. Something I have still not forgiven her for as I had to watch 2 more hours of this stilted movie. Too much CG. Rabbits! Where on Tolkiens Middle Earth did they come from? I could only think of one thing ... 'When does it end?'<br/><br/>There is a good side. I don't have to go the cinema for the next 2 Decembers.<br/><br/>So LOTR 10. An unexpected disappointment 1.<br/><br/>Oh one more thing, this gets a rating of 1 but only because IMDb won't allow me to put zero in."
"stella-starnes","3","7","12","21 April 2013"," a nice attempt, but not good enough
","As much as I was looking forward to this film, I have to say it is by no means brilliant. The only thing that kept me in my seat in the cinema was the hope that it would remain as faithful to the book as it does in the beginning for the remainder of the film. Sadly, not so.<br/><br/>Firstly, as exciting as it appears with an introduction of the Lonely Mountain of Erebor by Bilbo, this scene is way too long, as is the scene explaining the rift between Goblins (yes, GOBLINS, definitely not Orcs) and Dwarfs, which is not even accurate. For a book of only 300 pages, ""The Hobbit"" deserves to be made into one clever portrayal on the big screen without bordering on the inaccuracy and overindulgence that went into the history and fighting scenes of this film. Yes, it is nice to indulge, but that can be decided by the audience, not the film makers.<br/><br/>Secondly, you always get a wonderful sensation from reading the book. It is funny, playful, light hearted and only slightly serious. This film adaptation paints the whole original story completely black, and where there is humour, it is so silly and not even half as witty as Tolkien wrote it. Also, I do not believe the film makers made any real effort in casting the Dwarfs, who are meant to carry the story as well as the title character, so that all you get is a bunch of money loving idiots who are both rude and perfectly ridiculous. I don't like this. These Dwarfs, as Tolkien wrote them, are actually polite and tolerable. On the big screen, however, they are painful to watch, particularly their leader Thorin because he looks so frigging miserable.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I cannot stand ( I repeat, cannot stand) the change in the main antagonist of the story in this film. Instead of it being Smaug, who comes into the story much later than the film suggests, we have an absolutely hideous Orc, Azog the Defiler, who for starters looks completely CG and speaks no English at all that you have to read the subtitles to know what the hell he's saying (and it's not even very interesting). Aside from having a minor role in the battle before the walls of Moria, he brings nothing to the story whatsoever. I really wanted him to die every time he popped up, he makes the story drag, so that most of what you get is BLOODY fighting. Calm down film makers, please.<br/><br/>Fourth, as nice as it is to see a few old faces, Frodo has nothing to add to the story, and all the White Council does is TALK. I suggest taking them out of the story altogether if they pop up again. I think the same should apply to Legolas, it's pretty obvious he's only been cast for the second part as eye candy for the girls, and there is NO romance or anything of that sort in the original story.<br/><br/>If it's called ""The Hobbit"" it should all be told from Bilbo's point of view as he is the main character. OK, Martin Freeman plays Bilbo fairly well, but he needs a few lessons on the character of Bilbo Baggins. For a start, Bilbo is, although around fifty, a timid, shy, unassuming, unambitious Hobbit who does not want ANY adventures, and it is Gandalf who makes him leave Bag End. Now if that scene had been added in, that would have added to Bilbo's character, and made me laugh for good reason seeing as the rest of the film is trying to make you laugh, and this is just poor.<br/><br/>The visuals aren't too bad; I actually like the stone giants even if they do remind others of ""Transformers"" or ""Power Rangers"", the Shire is as fresh and verdant as ever, and perhaps the best scene by far is the ""Riddles in the Dark"" sequence, which makes me wonder why Serkis wasn't given a Special Award as the only interesting character in the entire film. The music is alright, but it isn't very good either; in the book there is lots of singing and merriment, and to me it's a shame that it isn't expanded on like it was for ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. Rivendell, sad to say, as gorgeous as it looks, now looks like a pastel painting, particularly when seen in 3D, which is also a shame. 3D may work reasonably well with animation, but not so well with live action, and I have living proof; ""The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" disappointed me with the storyline and the 3D aspect of it, there is too much 3D these days.<br/><br/>My apologies to any who call this film a masterpiece, but it is generally a prequel that takes far more elements from ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and therefore does not allow for closer examination of the story called ""THE HOBBIT"". This is why I prefer the book; with the book you can decide whether it is your cup of tea or not, but with the film it forces you to like it. Yes, some films based on books can be alright, but the overall storyline of the film is ruined. I say this as someone who read the book as a child and could read it again much faster and with much more enthusiasm than I could watch this film. I suggest you read the book, don't waste your time or money on such an unfortunate claim to tell the story better than Tolkien. New Line Cinema CAN do better than this."

"markaavis","5","10","19","12 February 2013"," An arrogant take on a classic
","I looked forward to the Hobbit with a sense of enthusiasm. I liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and forgave the examples where the films diverged from the book. I was forgiving as I guessed that Peter Jackson had to tread a fine line between keeping Hollywood happy, and still trying to stay true to the original. In other words, compromises were necessary and he did as good a job as possible.<br/><br/>The problem with the Hobbit is that, unlike the original trilogy, it is unlikely that these compromises were necessary. Jackson had the clout to remain true to the original. Please, do not misunderstand me; I am not a Lord of the Rings geek. I see them as great stories, but am not of the view that they are anything more than that. Tolkein is just a great and imaginative story teller. This is where my title for this review comes in.<br/><br/>When Tolkein wrote the Hobbit, he created a rather wonderful and childlike story. It was also a story that adults could read and enjoy. In either case, Tolkein showed his great gift for creating a wonderful and rather simple story. Sure, there are hints towards the Lord of the Rings, and hints at a wider story, but the story stood on its own two feet.<br/><br/>However, this was not enough for Peter Jackson. Instead, he sought to turn the story into an epic, and dreamed that he was creating a master work. However, what he really did was show his own arrogance. In place of a simple and childlike story, we have EPIC. In his arrogance, he destroyed the charm of the story. This is not to say that he made a bad film, but rather his arrogance diminished a great story that could have made a GREAT film. The film, as it stands, on its own merits is an okay film.<br/><br/>There are other problems. There are the choices of actors for the dwarfs. Richard Armitage as Thorin could not have been a more misconceived choice; whilst each person who has read the Hobbit will have their own mental image of Thorin, I very much doubt that anyone saw in their mind's eye anyone that might resemble Armitage. Instead, Armitage was undoubtedly chosen as 'eye candy' for the female audience. I have no problem with his acting, which is not a problem, but the problem is that he just is not suitable to play the character from the book. And he is a key character. It was illustrative of the problem with the film overall.<br/><br/>As for the action sequences, they were a little clunky. The giants scene seemed to be lifted from Transformers, and was just silly. Other sequences were okay, but okay is the word that captures the point. Okay.<br/><br/>There are bright spots. Martin Freeman is outstanding as Bilbo; the right manner, the modesty and 'normalness' of Bilbo capture the original character. He is a bright star amongst the disappointment.Ian McKellan reprises his role in the Lord of the Rings well, and provides a solid performance. As such, the film has redeeming features.<br/><br/>In the end though, in contrast to the film, the Hobbit is a short, fun childlike book with a great story told by a master storyteller. This is all lost in the film. Instead, where one long film could do the job, we have three films which try to turn a sweet and fun story into an epic. In his arrogance, Jackson threw out what made the Hobbit one of the best selling books of all time. Apparently, Jackson knew better than Tolkein how the story of the Hobbit should be told. Incredible arrogance when considering the enduring success and appeal of the original book. When watching the film, I could not help but have a sense of regret that so many of the younger watchers would think that this was 'The Hobbit'."
"bryonyx70","5","10","19","3 January 2013"," So close, but so far..
","There is no denying that a production of The Hobbit has been a highly anticipated event ever since Peter Jackson and his team first began producing the Lord of the Rings trilogy just over a decade ago. Expectations were high, although there seemed a positivity from fans and critics alike that Jackson and his crew would deliver to the same exceptionally high standard like that of the trilogy for which this film acts as a prequel; regrettably, it does not. <br/><br/>Why by no means would I class this feature as awful, is would be denial to suggest that the picture matches it predecessors in any way other than length. The decision to turn the 300 page book into a trilogy in itself has sparked controversy because of the questioning of its necessity, and yet I would have to suggest that dragging a novel so slight into a production so long is felt when watching the Hobbit. There is very little time to breathe once the quest has begun as it is quite literally one skirmish or battle after the next, leaving very little time to really develop characters and narrative. It almost feels as though we are watching a television series, whereby all of the smaller episodes have been combined into this film. There's just a bit too much going on, but not in a sophisticated interwoven way, rather there is a mess of editing between various characters and plot lines that leaves you feeling confused rather than interested. At first we are given our clear heading, like that of which we should for an adventure film, and in this case it is to regain an ancient dwarf city deep of which resides deep inside a lone mountain which was brutally and unjustly taken from the inhabitants by a cruel and greedy dragon. Simple enough. Yet too much is added unnecessarily around this, whereby the plot digresses into random plot lines like the necromancer of Mirkwood and an old enemy of the dwarf Thorin who decides to make a comeback. We can only assume that these different tangents will indeed link up to formulate a perfected finish which does indeed make sense but at this point we are just left guessing - not out of a curiosity, but rather a hope that there is actually a justification for these random interjections.<br/><br/>Despite this, the technological feats which Weta again achieves are expectedly phenomenal, an academy award nomination (if not win) definitely appears to be in the bag. The make-up and set design similarly achieve a level that so few films do which altogether create a sumptuous visual treat, all of which is aided by the natural beauty of New Zealand itself. Another aspect of the film worthy of true recognition is the cast of which all manage to hold their own despite its vast size. In particular when regarding this is Ian McKellen's Gandalf of whom is played flawlessly, yet even exceeding this is the humorous yet courageous performance of Bilbo Baggin's who is played by Martin Freeman. Freeman is able to channel the reserved, bumbling, quintessential Britishness that compiles Bilbo while at the same time giving him a heartwarming, and undoubtedly likable protagonist. The various cameos of previous characters like that of Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett and of course, the always incredible performance of Andy Serkis' Gollum add a certain nostalgia to the film as well as making the return to Middle Earth all the more real. <br/><br/>Overall it is hard not to be so critical because it has so much to live up to prior to its release. If The Hobbit had been produced before the first trilogy I believe that the expectations would not have been so over-bearing, and therefore the criticism not so harsh. I do not condone Jackson's film as poor, but I do believe that the high standard achieve previously just simply was not met. Arguably, however, with those standards so high, was it ever going to?"

","Yes i felt like i got The Chronicles of Narnia. The reason i feel like that is because overall i thought the movie was way too childish. <br/><br/>There were sooo many scenes which were way too predictable. Well not that throwing a few burning pineapples is gonna chase a group of orcs away is predictable... -_-' that's just plain idiotic, or at least the way they made it look in the movie...<br/><br/>There where so many stupid moments in the movie that it just annoyed me. Like when the stone giants are fighting, and the group is split in two. They make it look like 1 group is smashed against the wall, but wait.. no.. ooooow they're still alive!!....... -___-' are you friggin serious???? that's so cheap and cliché. <br/><br/>And bilbo almost falling off the cliff with the dwarf grabbing his arm and then almost falling himself, FRIGGING PREDICTABLE STUPID Cliché CRAP!<br/><br/>And worst of all, is how the film ended. With Thorin pretending to be mad at Bilbo when he really is not and hugs him then. WOOOOWWW I DID NOT SEE THAT COMIN!!! now everybody is happy jay!!! -_________-'<br/><br/>BUT.. i do gotta give this film some credit. I gave this movie 4 stars because of its Graphics and beautiful shots. And 4 stars is a lot because i care more about story than looks. <br/><br/>In the end i think Peter Jackson has been too focused on the big magic landscape shots the beautiful animations and the nice 3d effects. And the cost of it is that the story has fallen behind and there has not been payed enough attention to dialogues and how to keep tension."
"RTTerry","7","10","19","28 December 2012"," A fairly decent movie, but not The Hobbit you may have read...
","I will do my best to keep this review short, like the story Tolkien created, NOT like Peter Jackson is doing by making this into a trilogy.<br/><br/>I will start by telling you that all the special effects and CGI magic works well for visualizing an adventure story. The settings, the costumes, the filming, yes it all works well and looks marvelous! For that reason alone, and the wonderful soundtrack, Hollywood will love this movie. But... I came to the theater to see The Hobbit, and this is not how I remember the book to be. This is a drawn-out, over done attempt to milk the viewers for 6 plus hours and a lot of money, for a story that can easily be told in 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a very simple story, if you bother to read the book. It tells about a brave little creature teaming up with a band of hard-nosed dwarfs, who head out to fight a dragon.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has taken way too many liberties with the film by adding elements which were not a part of the book, and by dragging everything to the extreme just to lengthen his movie(s). He is trying to make this into another LOTR, which was not Tolkien's intention, and why Tolkien wrote The Hobbit first - THEN went on to write LOTR. A prime example of this is the first 40 minutes of the movie, which was covered in the book by just a dozen pages! Go see the movie to whet your appetite for some spectacular scenery and action sequences, but please do not think that these characters and the storyline were as they appeared in the book. I urge you to read the story if you haven't already, so you can understand how the focus was on a timid little character who managed to survive perilous situations. It seems that Jackson is more intent on making EVERYONE a hero, a fighting master, a focal point and portraying them ALL as main elements to the story."
"Maaarcus","10","16","34","28 December 2012"," Humour, action and tension. What more does one need?
","As an avid movie watcher, I was very excited to hear two years ago that The Hobbit was indeed going to be filmed. Two years later there I was walking into the cinema with a bigger butterfly in my stomach than when i went to see The Dark Knight Rises. Was it going to be good? As intense as The Lord of the Rings? Would i like it? I went in (after 15 minutes of waiting for a drink) and got my seat and watched it. <br/><br/>I can now say that it was the best money and time i have spent this year. It swiftly took the top spot for my personal favourite film of 2012. I loved the humour which i had heard so much about and i loved the choice of actors for the dwarfs. As soon as i got home i was telling my friends to go and see it, i highly recommend you go and see it if you haven't yet. Everything works in together, everything makes sense, and everything seems to add to the The Lord of the Rings experience. It improves the understanding of Middle Earth and how everything came to be in the story of The Lord of the Rings. I had one concern about the film, and that was whether it would be as dark hearted as The Lord of the Rings ... and i can honestly say that it is definitely not. Don't get me wrong, there is the darkness there but it is lessened by the great humour. I will be buying this on Blu-ray, it definitely deserves it. <br/><br/>To conclude. Just go and see it! <br/><br/>Thanks."
"moonracer0120","6","16","34","19 December 2012"," Jackson's genius ruined by Hollywood greed
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey greatly lacks the authenticity of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit is overblown, overdressed, formulaic, the script is dumbed down for 5 year olds and the cast of dwarfs look more like characters in a Disneyland revue than from the Middle Earth of J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination. Who are the bozos that authorized such stupid additions to this film? I can't imagine PJ thought this was appropriate.<br/><br/>Right off the bat the movie insults the audience with a joke about croquet, a sport invented by the British in 1856. I doubt if Tolkien had ever envisaged his dwarfs to know anything about some frilly game invented by the British upperclass in the 19th century. Tolkien's dwarfs are supposed to be much closer to the characters of Beowulf and Norse mythology than Victorian England. And for the record, dwarfs should NEVER drink tea (tea became popularized in England in the 17th century-long after the time of Beowulf!)<br/><br/>Really sick of Hollywood treating us, the ticket-buying public, like a bunch of idiots. I will wait for the second edition of this unnecessarily extended film to go to DVD. Special effects and IMAX 3D are nice but not at the expense of a good book!"
"hltvcomar","7","16","34","19 December 2012"," Good film, could've been better
","I went into the cinema one week after the movie came out without having read any of the critics on internet. I'm a big Tolkien fan, and I've read Silmarillion, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings 5 times each around the time the LOTR movies came out. My fanaticism went down in this ten years, but I still have Tolkien as my favorite author.<br/><br/>I was in Te Anau, New Zealand when The Hobbit was being shot, and the Production Team came to film to the town I was working, so I got to see all the actors, and that got me excited for the story again. One year later, I went into the cinema.<br/><br/>I really liked the introduction to the story. The LOTR and The Hobbit connection -which needed to be made- was smooth and it was good to see the old actors again. Now that's when people link the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring and this movie. And that is not a bad thing if you're expecting to see something as good and profound as what you have seen before.<br/><br/>But The Hobbit doesn't focus too much in making a connection with the spectator.<br/><br/>In the first part of the film, Bilbo is our hero, our main character and the one we can feel identified to. The dwarfs and Gandalf add a great environment to this adventure, but I think that after the first part they take away that connection we had with Bilbo, and him, who is to be the center of the film at all times, is somehow forgotten. Of course, this doesn't happen in the book, since Bilbo is the teller and we're in his head the whole time. <br/><br/>I think there was a big writing issue in the screenplay. I think the biggest fault was concentrating in the action and forget about the argument. At no moment I have felt suspense -except the riddles scene- or that adrenaline that makes you think everything will be lost. For example, in The Fellowship of the Ring, I put both my hands over my mouth when Frodo got stabbed by the troll in Moria. I thought he was dead. In The Hobbit, you never feel that danger, since some of the scenes are filmed in a cartoonish way, especially the one inside the Goblin Cave when the group is heading to the exit. You kind KNOW nothing's gonna happen to them. <br/><br/>Same thing when the two giant rock monsters fight. I truly think this is the scene that represents how over the limit the writing went. It's like they just wanted to put more action for the sake of it, and to show how good are special effects nowadays... again.<br/><br/>I truly hope the next movies bring back this connection we felt with all our beloved characters in LOTR, at least with the one most important which is Bilbo. I would really like more character development than action and clichés."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","5","16","34","15 December 2012"," The Hobbit, or When Hollywood Franchises Go Wrong
","Years ago, when it was announced that Guillermo Del Toro would direct the prequel to the Lord of the Rings and that Tolkien's classic would be turned into two movies, people were skeptical that it could be done. So you can imagine that when Peter Jackson took over and The Hobbit became a trilogy, people were flabbergasted. Could Peter Jackson really pull it off? Could The Hobbit be turned into a sprawling three part epic? Now that the first movie is out, I would say the answer is ""no."" The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey is well acted and beautifully shot, but its episodic structure and excessive length (three hours) bores more than it entertains.<br/><br/>The Hobbit tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins's adventure with Gandalf the Grey (reprised by Ian McKellen) and thirteen dwarfs who are determined to retake the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the evil dragon Smaug. Bilbo, a Halfling who has never left his home, seems an unlikely teammate for such a mission, but Gandalf sees an inner courage in Bilbo that the dwarfs do not. Bilbo embarks on the journey to prove his worth and to have an adventure. He is designated as the official ""burglar,"" despite his objection to the term, because his small size and light weight make him stealthy compared to the dwarfs. Martin Freeman, best known as Watson on the BBC's hit series Sherlock, plays Bilbo as a classic ""fish out of the water"" character. He is clumsy, fearful, and a burden on his teammates. <br/><br/>The Dwarf king Thorin, a fierce warrior played by Richard Armitage, believes Bilbo is more trouble than he is worth. Yet many of the dwarfs seem ill fit for the mission as well, since many are too old, too fat, or too young to be great warriors. On the journey, the team of misfits encounters all sorts of nasty creatures, including goblins, trolls, and Thorin's arch-nemesis, the pale Orc. They travel along mountains, canyons, and plains, while making a stop in the Elf city, Rivendell, where LOTR alums Elrond, Galadriel, and Saruman the White make appearances. And in the most memorable scene in the movie, Bilbo steals Sauron's ring from the creature Gollum. By the end of the movie, Bilbo proves to be quite a brave warrior and earns the respect of the dwarfs. <br/><br/>The plot description certainly sounds exciting on paper, but The Hobbit is surprisingly boring. For a three hour film, not much really happens. Peter Jackson pads his work with long exposition on the history of the Dwarfs, a fake tension between the elves and the dwarfs that doesn't go anywhere, dwarf songs, and an unnecessary subplot about Radagast the Brown (played by Doctor Who, Sylvester McCoy!), a wizard who encounters the Necromancer, a sorcerer who can raise the dead (SPOILER: the necromancer is Sauron). While some of this content was in the original book, much of it has been expanded (needlessly). Unlike the Lord of the Rings films, which at least had a decent narrative flow, this film has more of an episodic quality. It is essentially a collection of miniature adventures better suited for television than a feature film. Really, this movie could have been an hour shorter. It's sad because I could see this being a really good HBO miniseries, but as a feature film it does not work.<br/><br/>I wish I could say more about this film, but there isn't much more to say. This is what happens when Hollywood's obsession with franchises goes wild. They turn self-contained, simple adventure stories like The Hobbit into inflated trilogies. The Hobbit is simply not an epic. Now, if Jackson can edit the next two films so that they don't have the episodic feel of this movie, perhaps he can save the rest of this trilogy. But The Hobbit has already set a new December opening day record of $37.5 million, and I fear that the high box office returns will deter Jackson from changing his style. If the movies are going to make a ton of cash anyway, why should he listen to the critics? <br/><br/>The best thing it has going for it is the cast. They have great chemistry and they are very funny. Sure, the effects were great, (although the Orcs looked better in the LOTR trilogy). The action scenes were fun, but in the absence of a narrative flow they became tiresome. Freeman plays an endearing Bilbo and he is really the highlight of the film. Unfortunately, The Hobbit just falls flat. I hope Jackson can fit all the subplots in the next two films together in a proper narrative structure, or else we can expect more bad reviews for certain and maybe diminished box office returns."
"mayhem-543-414338","5","12","24","26 December 2012"," an unexpected disappointment...though there's still hope....
","I was so desperate to see this movie! So, so excited and I was ready to argue with everyone who didn't like it, but...how awful I felt when I saw it! I mean, what happened? What went wrong?<br/><br/>To clear some things out, I am huge fan of Tolkien books and I saw LOTR trilogy 50 times at least. So you know how I felt when the Hobbit movie was announced. It was such a wonderful feeling. I had no complaints when they announced it will be the trilogy, thought the more time in Middle-Earth the better. Also, I knew there will be some additions from appendices of The Return of the King book and other Tolkien writings and I had nothing against it. I even thought it will be nice addition to a whole thing which will only levitate it to new heights. So you see, I was prepared for this movie in any way, well in any way but this....I hate to say it, but it felt like almost typical Hollywood blockbuster movie :(<br/><br/>Now, where to begin? I saw the movie in 24 fps 3D so I cannot judge of the new HFR technology, but I can tell you that this classic 3D wasn't special at all (especially after the insane 3D in the Oz the Great and Powerful trailer which aired before the movie). Few scenes apart it was hardly noticeable. And now onto actual movie review...<br/><br/>Many people complained about the first hour of the movie (apart from the wonderful prologue, yes it was wonderful, tough I kind of disagreed with those Mass Effect spaceship looking dwarf kingdom), the part at Bag End with all these dwarfs coming and eating every food in its path. But to me, this was the part which reminded me off the book the most. The acting was good, the setting, the pace, everything (even jokes) and I thought, if this is the worst part then I'm in for a threat! <br/><br/>How wrong I was...the true problem with this film is when the action actually comes in. It is absolute nonsense! It is like watching Pixar/Disney cartoon! Everything is overblown out of proportions. It looks like producers wanted to see all their money invested through CGI effects full blown out on screen minding not if there is no brain in it?! So you have scenes like that stone giants fight. Like it isn't enough that dwarfs and Bilbo are in the midst of that NON survivable fight, but they had to be on the legs of one of those titans (who could easily smash poor Sauron like a fly if they want to) which is even more ridiculous. It all looks stunning on screen but it is an insult for intelligence. I know this is in some way fairy tale and they thought scenes like this would be suitable (especially for children), but if they thought like that, why did they put in scenes like the one when Gollum kills that goblin with rock which is absolutely disturbing for any child? It looks like Hollywood these days wants to make money grabbers for all the audiences no matter which age, but that is wrong approach! In the end you finish with the movie which has cartoonish scenes for children like those when Gandalf and dwarfs are sliding on the part of bridge down the rock over 100m with no harm (insanely stupid!), singing frog looking clown of a Goblin king (which is scary in the book btw Peter Jackson), all our good guys hanging on the tree which for some reason refuses to submit to the insurmountable law of gravity, crazy moron Radagast the brown on those stupid Santa Claus rabbit sledge which in the book is just weird (not mad)cause he prefers talking to animals more than humans etc on one hand and on the other it has serious scenes for grownups like white council (and other dialog heavy scenes), Dol Guldur apparition, Azog killing one orc and throwing him to the wargs to be eaten, many beheading all around, a bunch of scary looking goblins and orcs, Gollum (yes he's scary for children) etc. You see, that's the problem with this movie. The childish scenes are insult for grownups and those serious scenes are scary or boring for children and you end up with a movie which does not belong to any targeted group. Nor they like it nor they hate it. It is called mediocrity Peter Jackson and so is this movie unfortunately. It could have been so much more if they tuned a little more brain in the writing and designing process but alas, now is too late, the damage is done, though I do hope that next two movies will fix this mess somehow. After all there're so many good things with this movie, acting, the pacing, most of the story, the scenery, the music so they are good indicators that there's still hope for the next two. At least now Peter you know that you're wrong (just listen to the critics and fans of original trilogy with intelligence and see the box office that there's no profit in nonsense cause everything less than a billion is a fail for such grand production) and I'm sure you'll make other two movies good cause I know you can, you have proved it in the past (and please stop copy/paste of Lord of the Rings scenes, we know you made that trilogy, no need for reminding)!<br/><br/>I could have been harsh and give this movie a 5, but since this is an unfinished story I'll give it 7 in the name of hope for the next two installments."

","Movie Had too much potential, I'm very disappointed and saddened as a huge LOTR enthusiast (greatest movies of all time). Movie is totally ruined by trying too hard to be LOTR (and also trying not to be at the same time), Poor humor and references to modern day humor, Recycled OST (the original hobbit ost parts are amazing), Poor Monster design (example Azog), Out of place & overused CGI, lot of badly thought out scenes, Movie confused between being an adult or children's movie, lack of thrill and suspense and un-required silly additions (example Radagast). While the Scenery is great, overall world design is disappointing (except for the old dwarf kingdom) <br/><br/>Plus side is the acting is superb and the original aspects of the OST is amazing. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson let himself down and let his true fanbase down. A lot of people who liked the movie are in Denial, or new to the series, or are simply blind / out of touch with what makes a movie great. Most LOTR fans , or even anyone who liked and cherish LOTR found this movie disturbingly disappointing. <br/><br/>And YES i read the book btw. <br/><br/>I can only hope the 2nd is superior, though i'm not very hopeful.<br/><br/>The Rating on IMDb has gone down a bit, and i'm sure it'll go lower as days go by. Rotten tomatoes has a more accurate rating on this movie (65%)"
"li-lily35","10","14","29","15 December 2012"," Don't listen to critics
","To make things clear, don't listen to critics OR everyone who rated badly. From what I've read, the main complaint is that the movie didn't possess the same grandeur/feel of the lord of the rings trilogy. Well to put it shortly, it isn't SUPPOSED to be the same. From reading the books you can already tell the hobbit was definitely written for a younger crowd-everything from language to plot is simply different. In LOTR, the fellowship is trying to save middle-earth. In contrast, the hobbit centers on Bilbo going on a journey to help Thorin win back his mountain - there is considerably less at stake here and so the whole mood is slightly lighter. As for excitement and action, I'd say there is enough, a lot more than I'd expected anyways. It looks like peter Jackson even changed some parts to make them more exciting which I thought was fine since the end result was always the same as the book. Beside, since when have movies been 2 hours of nonstop action? Slow parts are only to be expected. (even then, I wouldn't really call any part of the movie slow.) As for acting, I would say it was decent all around. No one was nauseating or laughable (in a bad way). I see some people complaining of the lack of tension. Well, once again, I say that is expected. No one died of course because no one is supposed to die. Reading the hobbit, I never felt particularly nervous for the characters at any time until the end. And when do any characters die at all? Oh, right. The end. This is only part one of three. Overall, this story is primarily about how Bilbo grows and changes, some of which is already seen at the end of this movie. It's not about saving the world. So of course it isn't the same as LOTR. Finally, as for visuals, I don't have much to say. Landscape scenes were magnificent as usual for Peter Jackson. 48 fps? Im not even sure I whether I saw it that way or not. Probably not considering all the complaints. In conclusion, GREAT movie and definitely worth seeing."
"apo1978","10","14","29","14 December 2012"," Fears be gone! You shall not pass!
","Being a huge Lord Of The Rings fan (my favourite films of all time) I met the Hobbit with trepidation. Especially after some of the reviews aren't as glowing as they were for the original trilogy.<br/><br/>""It's too long"", they moan. Well, not for me – the 169 minutes flew by. Sure, the opening three-quarters-of-an-hour did were spent solely in Hobbiton but, being the first part of a trilogy, it needed to. It was nice being back there, listening to Howard Shore's majestic score and marvelling at the lush (as always) scenery. It was like coming home to an old friend. Ah, the Shire, how cinema's missed you.<br/><br/>""It not as epic as Lord Of The Rings"" they bark. Of course it's not, it's not supposed to be! It would be foolish if they tried and replicated the scale of Rings. OK, the ante is ramped-up considerably from the book so it was still pretty epic albeit with a slightly lighter touch, whilst still maintaining the same feel and tone. I was back in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>""They overused CGI!"" they cough. Yes, there is a lot of CG but it didn't feel out-of-place (like the Star Wars prequels). The important thing is, the CGI characters actually ""perform"" which gives them weight. The main big-bad Orc ""Azog"" grew on me as the film went on and proved to be a great villain that you don't want to see die too quickly (I won't say if he does or not). Which is a good sign.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman was simply superb as Bilbo (no longer ""Tim"" from The Office) capturing all of Ian Holm's older Bilbo's mannerisms. His comedic timing is impeccable, with just subtle facial reactions being enough to make you smile. Ian McKellan was brilliant as always and praise has to be reaffirmed on Andy Serkis for his performance as Gollum, once more stealing the show. The ""Riddles In The Dark"" sequence being an absolute triumph. The dwarfs were decent also, even though half of them weren't given much to do (maybe they'll get more in the sequels) the stand-out being Richard Armitage's ""Thorin"" who made for a suitable hero figure.<br/><br/>Along the way there are plenty of neat touches and nods towards the original trilogy, implying there are darker things to come. The success in this is that it feels like it could've been made alongside the older films. Whereas many sequels/prequels after 10 years can lose the magic and essence of their predecessors, The Hobbit does not. It gets the balance just right.<br/><br/>That's not to say it's a perfect film. There are a couple of silly moments, like the dwarfs surviving a ridiculous fall in the mines and Sylvester McCoy's surplus-to-requirements animal loving Radagast – but those moments make up for about 10 seconds of its near 3 hour run time. And, no, it's not as good as The Lord Of The Rings. But then, it didn't need to be – and nor did I want it to."
"Leofwine_draca","5","6","10","10 October 2013"," The cinematic equivalent of watching a dog dragging its butt along the carpet
","While I loved Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, I'm sorry to say that he's fumbled - nay, dropped - the ball with this prequel, the first of a three-film adaptation of Tolkien's earlier children's book, THE HOBBIT. AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is the cinematic equivalent of watching a dog dragging its butt along the carpet - funny at first, but once the novelty wears off it quickly becomes tiresome.<br/><br/>The thing that kills the movie is Jackson's hubris, which has been in evidence ever since he finished work on RETURN OF THE KING. The sad truth is that he hasn't made a good film since; KING KONG was, like this, overlong and silly, while THE LOVELY BONES had potential but was sappy and effects-laden. Jackson's ego is so huge that he indulges every whim, every lowbrow, snot-laden gag with nary an editor in sight. It's like attempting to read the sleep-inducing later Harry Potter books by J. K. Rowling.<br/><br/>THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY has certain appealing qualities, and times when it favourably recalls the glory days of RINGS, but they are few and far between. The best scene is, of course, the one most faithful to the book, the finding of the ring with Gollum. In fact, there's half a good film in here, and that half consists of all the scenes taken from the story. Unfortunately, the rest is added in, padded in, CGI nonsense with one interminable action scene after the next, sloppily written and entirely predictable throughout. It's a huge, atmospheric fantasy world reduced to the level of a mindless computer game. Jackson must be blind.<br/><br/>Of course, I wanted to like this. The team have assembled a great cast, with Martin Freeman fitting the lead role like a glove and Richard Armitage changing neatly from TV fare to movie epic, although other actors fare less well. It becomes highly apparent that Ian McKellen's Gandalf is here merely to drive the plot forward, despite Jackson's best efforts to give him extra gravitas and meaning.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie's muted appeal and incessant nonsense has meant that I'm not looking forward to the next two films in the trilogy, given that they appear to contain equal amounts of mindlessness. What a pity - Jackson clearly has creative genius within him, but his best work seems further and further away."

There were whole 10min in the 2h50min worth seeing in 3D - flying eagles an flying butterfly. Titanic movie with Leonardo DiCaprio is more exiting than The Hobbit. There's a lot of walking and walking and running and running in this movie. I honestly think that the movie could have been cut to a shorter version.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the ratings here are way too high for this movie."
"web-534-393830","4","9","17","27 December 2012"," A grotesque beginning for a new saga
","Poor Tolkien. Poor Peter Jackson. I am so sorry to see the result of this work. The bankruptcy and budget issues around this production is evident and made me realise how wonderful The Lord of Rings is. Unfortunately there is almost nothing I can praise for the moment and I'll enumerate the most difficult issues around this poor realization.<br/><br/>Screenplay: First 4 exiting minutes with great and known actors from the saga, I felt happy rubbing my hands and prepared for a great adventure. But then 25 minutes later still in Bilbo's home, presenting the dwarfs in an ever repeating feast wasn't an adult enjoyment and I kind of felt that the movie was rather designed for kids collecting figurines in a happy meal. And that's exactly what happened throughout the movie. Trolls are no longer tuff, kings joke before dying, goblins look like moppets, obvious action sequences, dialogues devoid of magic and depth and the attention of the viewer mainly caught by farts, burps and scattered, missed, failed resolutions... <br/><br/>Make-up: Not the same team that worked for the L.O.R. but for King Kong, we see a low budget un-believable group of dwarfs and goblins. I've never remarked how make-up is a key element to be able to be drawn into the story. The superficiality of the make up made me remember over and over that this is an ordinary production and most of all, just a movie.<br/><br/>Music: Howard Shore couldn't keep the same intensity successfully held for L.O.R. Yes, the new theme is related and yet not as effective. Even the already known theme doesn't accompany the sequences. There is no effective resolution on critical moments of victory or grief. The mixing and mastering have lost the unique touch of fantasy and glory. Not only me but people around me didn't feel deeply moved like in any of the three previous movies (Moria, Rohan, Cirill river entry to Gondor, Lorothien, countless more sequences)<br/><br/>Colour treatment: Sunrises and sunsets are saturated to the point of a cartoon-like superficiality. Maybe the 3D treatment didn't help in this regard, in that case I'll watch it again and edit the review in the future.<br/><br/>Casting: The same actors look disconnected from the story, there's no intensity and this might come from a tired and stressed director in my opinion. <br/><br/>The only thing working throughout the entire film is Gandalf. With Excellent performance, make-up, all around Gandalf is amazing and inspiring. Five stars to Gandalf. Hugo Weaving's and Kate Blanchet did a nice job alone. Elrond and Galadriel's makeup is also refined and the character traits remain the same as in their previous participations. Another great sequence is when Bilbo meets Gollum. Well acted, interesting dialogues, like in another movie. But all this counts too few to add more than two stars to this realization.<br/><br/>It is all a bit sad. Even if Peter Jackson's version of TLOR never existed, this work just failed to outshine Tolkien's story or at least lead us to a fantastic film for all ages. Not recommended. Let's hope that the sequel in 2013 and 2014 have a better outcome, a movie worth remembering."

I was pleased when I heard of the decision to make three movies out of the Hobbit--there's certainly enough material for it--but I was disappointed with the material they decided to put in this film. It's a lengthy piece, but far too much of the time is devoted to (beautifully choreographed) fighting. I think they could have shaved off at least 15-20 minutes of unnecessary violence. The CGI effects for the villainous creatures were great, but there didn't have to be that many of them. More time could have been spent developing characters or enjoying Tolkien's beautiful dialogue. That being said, however, I quite enjoyed the film. The first shot of Gollum sitting on the rock was everything I've ever imagined it to be. Gollum continued to be an enjoyable, interesting, and well-done character. <br/><br/>A little less violence, more character development, and more dialogue would have gotten it a 10/10. As it is, great job."
"ghost_dog86","4","20","45","15 December 2012"," 48 fps?! WHY?!!!
","If not for the action packed final hour of this film, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" would have been more of a disappointment than it already was. Directed by none other than Peter Jackson (more about his direction to come) this prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy follows a young Bilbo Baggins (if you don't know who I'm talking about, then you can stop reading now) who (for some reason) is compelled to accompany a rag tag group of pot smoking Dwarf's (all with unpronounceable names) on their three movie quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erbor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Again, if that all sounded like baby talk to you, then stop reading now, because this is not your type of movie. Furthermore, this plot does fall into the pitfall of, if you are going into this movie cold (or with no prior knowledge of J.R.R. Tolkien's novels or Jackson prior films) then your issues will be in finding a reason to care about Bilbo's journey at all, even though he is an intriguing character. Anyway, for the most part this is a watered down version of anything seen in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but still, with Jackson's customary copious exposition and million dollar battle sequences. There is also a welcome tone of levity throughout, that while departs from the beloved source material, does push this very awkwardly slow film forward (somewhat). With all of that said, there is no, no, NO REASON that this story needs to be separating into three 3 hour films! Because isn't Tolkien's The Hobbit only like 300 pages to begin with? Side Note: By now most of you know that this film is the first in a trilogy. And if you are familiar with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, then you have a good idea of how Jackson likes to structure the endings (or non-endings) of the first two films. So, if you are not a fan of 3 hour movies with no endings (and when I say 3 hours, I really mean 2 hours and 49 minutes, but you get my point) then again, stop reading now, this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>48 fps is not cinematic: So does the production company just let Jackson do whatever he wants now?! While the set design is amazing, the score is epic, and the story, while meandering, will satisfy fans of The Lord of the Rings series, the film looks like utter crap. In shooting ""The Hobbit"" in 48 frames per second, Jackson has chosen to make everything on screen look like the behind-the-scenes portion on a Blu-ray DVD. Everything CGI looks aggressively fake, and far too lit. When characters are walking around, it is obvious that they are walking through massive sets on a sound stage. And as for the characters themselves, not since ""Battlefield Earth"" has a film looked more like a bunch of actors, running around in prosthetics and hair pieces. This 48 frames technique also makes character motions look extremely sped up, to the point where I thought something was wrong with the projection for the first ten minutes. In short, filming in 48 fps repeatedly takes the viewer out of the cinematic glossiness, by continuously reminding us all that we are watching a movie with actors, on sound stages, wearing bad prosthetics. Trust me, like an old-timey BBC production, the look of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is total GARBAGE. And worst of all, throughout the film you never get used to it; despite what other critics may be saying.<br/><br/>OK, so Jackson has gone on the record to state that this type of filmmaking is the way of the future. And even though many have complained that 48 fps makes everything look as if you're on set watching the actual filming, he is fiercely unapologetic. And, while I hate to admit that he may be right in this aspect (much like the people who unfortunately proclaim that 3D is here to say) it doesn't change the fact that this 48 fps doesn't work for a movie that is so predicated on a suspension of belief that comes along with its science fiction visuals. And if you think I'm making too much of this aspect, I'm not. The picture quality here is not only distracting, but off-putting. And it's a shame because the plot itself, for what it is (despite its pacing) is enjoyable enough.<br/><br/>There are some aspects that work here, that I haven't touched on already. There are a few cool, battle sequences with Orcs and Goblins and the performances here are all fine; the stand out being Martin Freeman, who plays the neurotic role of Bilbo Baggins better than Elijah Wood ever played Frodo Baggins. Also, I should mention that Andy Serkis as Gollum steals the show here, but it may disappoint many to know that he doesn't even show up until the final hour of the movie, for all of 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Simply stated, if you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, then there will be some thematic stuff here to enjoy (mostly near the end of the film) but otherwise don't bother with ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"".<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson <br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus"
"TommyTheSwede","10","15","32","12 December 2012"," Masterpiece?
","First things first. I grew up with the literary works of Jrr Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings-trilogy by Peter Jackson is my all time favorite movies and that he was returning to Middle-Earth for an adaptation of The Hobbit which is my favorite of the Tolkien-books I got excited as hell. I have been anticipating this movie like no movie before it so the expectations on this movie is high. So could it meet my expectations and be a welcome return to Middle-Earth or would it be another ""Phantom Menace""?<br/><br/>Well, I'm happy to inform you that this is another Masterpiece and even though it's a different kind of beast than Lord of the Rings, as it should be, I found it to be on par with The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>All the actors were great in their roles. Martin Freeman was a perfect Bilbo, perfectly capturing the essence of Ian Holm's performance but still giving it his own spin. He is courageous, curious, funny and completely engaging.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen is back as Gandalf and again did a wonderful job. Nothing more needs to be said about that.<br/><br/>Richard Armitage was excellent as Thorin Oakenshield, perfectly capturing the essence of the character and making him a complete bad-ass warrior but with heart and a vulnerability.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchet, Ian Holm Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis especially were of course great in their respective roles they played in Lord of the Rings and all the actors playing the Dwarfs also did a great job at making them individual even though you don't get to know everybody, But then again you didn't really get to know Legolas or Gimli either during the entire LOTR-trilogy so that's not an issue. The dwarfs were all individuals, some getting more screen time than others but the main thing is that they were all entertaining.<br/><br/>The story takes it time to get going, and I liked that. It helped me get immersed in the characters and the world, getting back into Middle-Earth slowly and nicely, introducing the characters and setting up the story perfectly.<br/><br/>How Peter Jackson incorporated the short stories and appendixes that Tolkien wrote that expanded the story, events and characters of The Hobbit was masterfully done. The thing is, I'm excited that The Hobbit is going to be three movies and I'm gonna tell you why. The Hobbit book as wonderful as it is, is a bit underdeveloped.<br/><br/>If Jackson didn't incorporate the appendixes we would have a very black and white story with underdeveloped characters and unexplained events (MINOR SPOILERS) like Gandalf suddenly leaving (END OF MINOR SPOILERS) with no explanation that would just leave the audience puzzled and it would make the movie filled with unanswered questions. What the added material does is not only fill the gaps that Tolkien originally didn't, but it also ties it together better with Lord of the Rings. Events going on in Middle-Earth that affects the quest of our heroes. Thanks to the added material things makes so much more sense and some critics have called some of the scenes in the movie to be ""filler"" and to me it's clear that they simply haven't read the appendixes and don't know that the scenes they are talking about is actually toward events that's not only is going to appear in the sequels but that we have already seen in the LOTR-trilogy.<br/><br/>While the story might not be as epic or grand in scale as the one in LOTR.since there's not as much at stake since doesn't mean that the movie is less exciting and I can't believe that some critics are actually using that as an argument. Sure, the stakes are higher and the story is grander in LOTR with everybody joining the quest for the greater good for Middle Earth but in The Hobbit the story is more personal. The dwarfs fight for their own land that has been taken from them and they simply want to take it back and reclaim their former glory and for understandable reasons we understand not only why it's so important for Thorin but also why the rest are following him.<br/><br/>And you really care for them to get their land back. I can tell you this, after seeing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey I cared more about the dwarfs getting their land back then I cared about The Fellowship saving Middle-Earth after I saw Fellowship of the Ring for the first time. And that's a testament to the powerful storytelling and the likability of all the actors. And the slower pace is one of the reasons you actually get attached to them. But it's Bilbo and his arc that is the beating heart of this movie.<br/><br/>The action-scenes is every bit as exciting as the action-scenes in the LOTR-Trilogy but in this movie they also have more unexpected humor that actually works without taking you out of the movie and the climax of this movie is simply put breathtaking.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. And I will be seeing it again and again.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/><ul><li>Howard Shore managed to recapture the magic he did with the LOTR-score with an amazing score.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How they worked in Ian Holm and Elijah Wood's cameos were great, nostalgic and a excellent way to reintroduce us to this world and characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gollum sure was creepy. Creepier and even more threatening than he was in the LOTR and Andy Serkis was excellent as always.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Unlike many critics, I really enjoyed Radagast and to those who claim that his scenes are pointless I have only one question: Were you even looking?</li></ul>"
"bilbowalks","10","5","8","17 January 2016"," A love letter to middle earth
","Hobbit:AUJ is an world where we meet trolls(funny and treacherous), goblins(unique and menacing), orcs(deadly),elves(angelic and guardians),wizards,dwarfs,giant eagles, and not the least of them hobbits. And also we visit places deep underground,high above ground, vast open spaces,calm and comfortable homes(in a hole in the ground), transcendental abodes,forests and ruined evil fortress.<br/><br/>Now put them all in a same story with a dragon,treasure, and a lot more with one badass scary,funny,heart warming story. The result you get is this movie. Did I mention about stone giants fighting each other in a cold night among mountains in a thunderstorm rain? Aw people. There is sooooo much good(believe me there is) in this movie I can forgive it for small mistakes if there is any. Nothing obvious is present anyhow.<br/><br/>And the music is excellent. You can't ask for any better. I can talk for a entire hour about this music and still it will not be enough. It fits the movie like glove in a hand. Perfect.<br/><br/>And the casting. At the end of the movie each and every characters became dear to me. It's one of those perfectly casted movie. Brilliant acting.<br/><br/>And there is visuals which you should see it yourself to believe. <br/><br/>When I think about this movie these are the words that comes to my mind. Heart warming,kind,brave,transcending, all good. I did not give this movie a 10/10 because it is perfect. No. I gave that rating because it deserves it. It's a humble effort to bring something good and entertaining movie to this world. It is filled with positivity.<br/><br/>Now to ranting. Many people consider this movie inferior because they compare this movie to lord of the rings and whine that it does not give them the same feel as lotr. It is totally unfair. No movie should be judged by comparing it with other movie. Judge a movie by its own merits. <br/><br/>That aside I will definitely recommend this movie for every folks out there. Enter a world of fantasy and relish living in middle earth among excellent folks, dangerous situations, kind and sweet moments and have one hell of an adventure. Peace."
"cls0680","2","5","8","4 November 2015"," Skip it. Read the book.
","I fell in love with Lord of the Rings, like most people did, in 2001. The movie took a classic novel and recreated it in a way that I'm sure Tolkien would have given a nod to. It gave us the same things that the book gave us when we were kids - imagination, emotion, laughs, tears - and only a couple of times did we really notice the computer generated effects, that, were, in all honesty, impressive and wowing for the time. But, it was in a way that did not take away from the natural-ism of the environment or the characters or story people have loved for decades. As the series went on, that changed. Though Peter Jackson originally kept to Tolkien's story, he started doing a ""George Lucas"" on us. Heart, soul, character development, storyline - it began to all be replaced with exaggerated CGI special effects and green screen work that became ever more obvious and distracting. By the third movie, I was ready to be done. I forgot why I cared at first and I had to re-read the book to remember the real magic of Tolkien again.<br/><br/>But it didn't end, unfortunately. Jackson decided to 'Lucas' up ""The Hobbit."" And, this time, he didn't just over-effect it to the point where it was distracting and obnoxious. He decided he was ABOVE Tolkien, and he completely changed the story of the book, the characters of the book, the relationships between them. I watched the first two Hobbit movies, and I couldn't watch the third. My children cried. Not because it was sad, because it was not ""The Hobbit."" It wasn't even ""Lord of the Rings."" It was Star Wars Episode I... only Lucas has an up on Jackson, because he actually WROTE HIS OWN story. Jackson just hi-jacked his, and crashed it.<br/><br/>The CGI effects in this are smothering. The setting feels so claustrophobic. Its obvious that the acting suffers from the lack of a setting/environment, but it doesn't matter, because the focus of the movie is on battle scenes where more and more and more effects can be used. The characters that are reprised from the original feel drier, emptier, even sadder.<br/><br/>The Hobbit was originally a children's adventure book. It is a fun - FUN - read. When I think of The Hobbit, the word I get is ""fun."" This movie recreates the dark, dreary, war-torn vibe of the Return of the King, and it feels sad and depressing the majority of the time. And, of course, we have to create a make-believe love story between two completely incompatible species and spend SO much time building on that so that it eventually becomes an obnoxious eye-roll jerker. Several character relationships were re-written to meet Jackson's need for personal tension and build up to made-up showdowns between characters who have imaginary ""personal problems"" with each other. These do not add to the movie, they detract more than anything. This movie leaves you upset, confused, and a little sad. Completely opposite of the book.<br/><br/>Now, of course, everyone is going to say ""it doesn't have to be exactly like the book!"" This is true... if we're talking about some obscure book that the majority of people have never read. But not all books are equal. There is a reason there is no 'Fahrenheit 451' movie. In many cases, movies are contemporary to the books that inspired them, and the movie actually makes people read the book (especially now). A lot of books only become classics because of their movies. The Hobbit is NOT one of these. It has been widely read for a long time, by many generations. Most people have read The Hobbit at some point in their lives. Its required reading in a lot of schools. In Britain, it is a national treasure, as is JRR Tolkien. You cannot take on such a well-known, broadly read, and deeply loved book like this and think you are above it, or you can improve on it, or that people who have loved it for many, many years aren't going to notice or care. A classic piece of literature like this is above us, not the other way around. There is something about these kinds of books that transcends us. Our ""take"" on them isn't valid, they are perfect as they are. Even worshiped by some people. When so many people know exactly what the story is, who the characters are, what the plot and purpose is, manipulating that destroys it's magic. It doesn't matter how visually stunning you make it, or how epic the battle scenes are. When you choose to take that responsibility to represent something so beloved, you have to do it with a certain reverence that I think was felt in the first LOTR movie, but waned after every one. There was no respect shown for this book in this movie. No appreciation. Respect started to be replaced with commercialization. For someone to think they can improve on it, or change it to make more money (ie. drag a short story out into three 3-hour movies)... something about that feels disrespectful and prideful. Like disrespecting your elders. <br/><br/>Even if you don't love the book or haven't read it, this movie has so little heart. Its drowning in computerization, the fun has been replaced by dark ire, and sadness, and awkwardness, and these things are hard to look past. The actors themselves are amazing, but its so hard to see it through the CGI that takes over. It turns the characters into accessories instead of centerpieces. It was easy to get bored, as someone who doesn't watch movies specifically for special effects. This movie was made to showcase CGI effects only, and to make money - and that is how it feels."

","I loved the original trilogy. But this was so disappointing. I bought for my wife for Xmas. We both were looking forward to watching it. I must have fallen asleep 3 times and each time I woke up I was gutted to see the film was still on. This surely is a cash cow franchise now. Boring. Slow. Pointless. The detail/animation/cgi was amazing as you would expect. But it felt like I was being told the story in slow motion. The first 30 mins of the film set the standard. I wanted to turn off at this point. I'm so angry I bought and sat through this rubbish. Hopefully this review will prevent someone else from suffering!"
"ugurlude","5","16","35","20 December 2012"," And we have another fail prequel after Star Wars
","I was afraid this would happen after the 48 fps issue was so hyped. Just like Star Wars prequels, this movie does not try to be good. It tries to maximize profit at the expense of quality. It tries to be both a child movie and an adult movie and fails at being either of them. It is horribly slow paced as it tries to milk us as much as possible by making 3 movies out of a 300 page book. Funny fact: it will take longer to watch the trilogy than read the book. This should tell you how ridiculous the pacing is.<br/><br/>Neither the quest nor the dwarfs are interesting or something I care about. In my opinion, dwarfs deserved what they got so I do not feel any sympathy for them or their quest. They are also not interesting as there is almost no character development which is unforgivable considering the pacing. Only dwarfs with some character are the leader and the white bearded old one and even they are pretty shallow. Others are typical dwarf stereotypes and I couldn't see any character difference between them. All dwarfs combined aren't anywhere near as likable or interesting as Gimli from LOTR.<br/><br/>About half of the movie consists of action scenes with a lot of CGI. I personally think 48 fps 3D looks pretty good(it won't work for every movie but it is good for this one) but the scenes are extremely silly and implausible which makes it hard to enjoy the visuals. About 20% of the movie is non-action scenes that are enjoyable and has purpose. The rest of the movie(about 30%) is meaningless filler. A consequence of the extreme implausibility is that the movie completely lacks tension. In FOTR, it felt like the party could be killed at any moment. In this one, we have an inexplicably invincible party. As a result, watching the movie is like watching some noob play a computer game with cheats and thinking he is awesome.<br/><br/>The movie tries to appeal to children with extreme silliness but at the same time, it tries to be serious in some scenes. It just doesn't work. Although I would prefer a pure adult movie, I might have also liked this a lot better if it decided to be a pure child movie rather than this in-between mess. Some serious scenes are not the only reason it doesn't pass as a child movie of course. The movie contains quite a bit of explicit violence and has very questionable values. For example, orcs are not clearly established as evil. Somehow we are supposed to hate them just because they are ugly and dwarf leader says they are bad. This kind of movie can make a child prejudiced, intolerant and unable to see different perspectives. We are also supposed to like dwarfs despite them being greedy and selfish. Pedagogically, the movie is a disaster and in my opinion should not be watched by children. If it is not intended for children, what is with the extreme stupidity?<br/><br/>Fortunately, there are some positives that make the movie watchable. Bilbo is interesting, entertaining and his character is correctly developed. Martin Freeman does a fantastic job and his acting is a joy to watch. Ian McKellen is also quite solid as Gandalf. The ""good morning"" dialogue between Gandalf and Bilbo is one of the best dialogues I ever watched in a movie. Galadriel and Elrond are cool as always. Some sceneries are really beautiful. Main villains are interesting. Events that suggest the rise of Sauron give a good mystical and insidious feeling. That might seem like a lot of positives but most of them take very little screen time.<br/><br/>Everything considered, I give this a 6/10. If you want to watch some good visuals and are able to be not bothered by silliness, then you should watch this. But if you are expecting something like LOTR or even a good movie in general, you will be disappointed."

It is not supposed to be scary or thrilling. It is supposed to be fun and adventurous which is exactly what Peter Jackson achieved in this movie. Okay I admit that a trilogy is just too much but I can see(apart from the money) the reasons why they decided to make it a trilogy. If you've read the book you can see that they recreated every page, every sentence of the book one by one which is a hell of a task. I've read the book when I was just 12 and I must say that this movie is exactly what I imagined when I was reading it. People just write blind review about how childish and colorful it is and how boring the movie is for an adult. Well...IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT YOU FOOLS. Someone actually wrote a review about how there are no woman... Well I'm not even going to comment on that which is just plain stupid. <br/><br/>For all those haters I advice them to go read the book and stop hating. Get a new perspective and watch it again.

This is why I gave it a 2 instead of 1 star. Now just team him up with a random 12 year old to write the script, and the result is guaranteed to be be 100X better than this garbage. Where is Jar Jar Binks? How did his part get cleaved from this masterpiece.<br/><br/>The only positive result from this movie is that I'm inclined to re-read The Hobbit, as it's been 10 years or more. Just so I can see how horrifically this junior high school student with millions of dollars has mauled the story. <br/><br/>I nearly vomited during the initial dwarven reverie in Bilbo's house.

"zterrell","2","8","15","22 March 2013"," dull to tedious
","Two more sequels to this? Good luck keeping the audience awake. Why? Well, let's start with stretching a single story into 3 movies 7-9 hours long. If you embark on such a mission to milk a cash cow, you should first hire some writers to flesh out likely characters, add some humor, perhaps include a romance, so the story isn't razor thin. After watching our hobbit on Sherlock the BBC telling of Sherlock Holmes, I felt he was an excellent choice. Too bad they didn't bring along Sherlock to give him some character. And the dwarf men are mostly disgusting barbarians with only two or three even being tolerable. Where is the fun in this movie? Where are the characters you want to root for? Even the visit to the elf village was dull and without any real story. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie. I was able to fast-forward the repetitious fight scenes -- again, a bunch of old, overweight dwarfs defeat hoards of warriors ( warriors that could notwhip Barbi!). It would have been a relief to have killed off a couple of the worst dwarf characters, even the wizard himself, or the hobbit...who would have noticed? They weren't the least little bit real to me and my wife anyway."
"holdings","5","8","15","11 February 2013"," Drowning in special effects
","In one of the 'Making of..."" interviews for Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson pointed out that ""this movie really needs to be made by someone who understands special effects, otherwise the special effects can easily overwhelm the story"" (I'm paraphrasing), and then did exactly that in the Hobbit. In the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's tale ruled supreme and the special effects were in their proper place. In this one, Tolkien's story is revised and pushed aside by the special effects. In Lord of the Rings, live actors are used as much as possible (even with Gollum) whereas in this one, computer graphics seem to be preferred. I think the introduction of a new character as the main antagonist is especially heavy-handed. To Peter's credit, it was probably a doomed project from the first. Lord of the Rings was a pseudo-sequel to the Hobbit and the 2 books are entirely different in character. The Lord of the Rings is a dark, dramatic adult epic. The Hobbit was a whimsical child's fairytale. But the screen won't have it."

","The LOTR trilogy which came out in movie theaters 11 years ago is one of the best trilogies and most successful of them ever made. So to say that The Hobbit movies coming out has a little bit to live up to would be a very big understatement.<br/><br/>I'm glad that Peter Jackson ended up being the director of the trilogy since his style of filmmaking is perfect for Middle Earth based stories. Guillermo del Toro would've done a fine job himself but PJ was basically born to make these movies. His style of being able to make movies with the action, fantasy, humor and story structure like this brings a certain style to this movie that other directors wouldn't have been able to pull off as well.<br/><br/>And for the fans of LOTR who haven't read any of the books you get introduced to a bunch of new characters you haven't seen before but also get some returning characters from the LOTR trilogy like the characters played by Frodo, Bilbo, Smeagol, Elrond and Galadriel."

","An unexpected journey, indeed.<br/><br/>If you expected The Hobbit would turn to be a great movie, you may want to expect the unexpected.<br/><br/>I mean, yes, the title character is masterfully performed by Martin Freeman; Gandalf, Galadriel and the beautiful landscapes are as enjoyable as ever, but that's about it. Oh yeah, there are a few scenic sunsets, too. What's left of the movie(like, the movie itself?!) suffers.<br/><br/>At the root of all this movie's evils is... greed. To near-sighted executives, three movies mean thrice the profit. You can do that with Lord of the Rings, which has three books rich with story and detail. But turning the simpler, younger-audience-oriented story of The Hobbit into three movies is simply overkill. And it shows. The director desperately tries to find more content to fit into the movie. Thus he puts in the movie aspects of the Middle Earth universe not covered in the book. He gives extended screen time to insignificant events, and he shamelessly bloats the movie with long, drawn-out fighting scenes, obnoxiously peppered with ridiculously cheap thrills.<br/><br/>There is that ""cliffhanger"" expression, but here it's obnoxiously literal. The whole movie is a non-stop race of literal cliffhanger moments. To give just an example, imagine a character hanging over a precipice, after having grabbed at the last possible moment, while falling, from another character that hangs himself from Gandalf's staff, that was stretched at the last possible moment towards him, to save him from a deadly fall; Gandalf himself grabbing the branch of a tree that itself hangs horizontally over the precipice, gradually uprooting itself, nestling the other members of Bilbo's party, that hang for dear life after managing to save themselves in that last standing three, which was itself knocked over in a domino effect by a series of falling trees on a thin stretch of land hanging over a precipice, where the warg-riding goblins cornered them, eventually, after a drawn-out chasing and fighting scene. Oh yes and when they all eventually fall from that tree, guess what, the giant eagles appear and catch them, at the last possible moment. That's an actual scene that pretty much sums up the whole movie, in all it's revolting obnoxious abuse of cheesy thrills.<br/><br/>So if you think you can withstand such a revolting insult to your intelligence, then, by all means, go see the movie, there's Bilbo in it, and Gandalf, and Galadriel and beautiful landscapes. Oh yeah, and scenic sunsets."

","I was really excited to see this. I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy very much. First however, let's talk about the good.<br/><br/>The 48 FPS thing is fantastic, it garnered some deep criticism but I thought this one was gorgeous looking film. CGI was top notch. Just looked fantastic. The Hobbit is funny. It's great comedy value, it did make me laugh. So that's good. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman is a fantastic actor. I've seen him in the Office, Sherlock Holmes (TV series) and The Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy so I knew he was the right choice. If anybody says 'blundering, confused mismatched and unwanted hero' then Martin Freeman does, he can pull that off. And that is exactly who the Hobbit is. So whoever cast Martin, well done. <br/><br/>The first half hour is fantastic, funny, light hearted, beautiful, well acted, and an exciting introduction to what should be a fantastic adventure. Should be. Let's get onto what I didn't enjoy, which was everything else.<br/><br/>The thing that annoyed me most, was I like to be surprised by a film. Unless you've read the books (I haven't, don't knock me for it), you go to a film to watch it to be surprised and engrossed by the story right? Most would agree you will enjoy a film more if you don't know what is going to happen. I hadn't seen LOTR for quite some time so I really had no anticipation for what the story may hold. <br/><br/>Yes towards this second half of the film every 'big' moment I saw coming five minutes off. Why? Clichés. It is FILLED with them. Everything I have watched is blatantly boring, predictable recycled cinema. Here come Spoilers by the way, so if you weren't aware of that, stop reading now please.<br/><br/>You just KNEW Bilbo was going to go and save Thorin. It was coming off by a mile. The big bad tough leader hates the good guy cliché and think's he useless, and then Bilbo saves him. I saw this coming once the two characters met. Then cue ludicrously cheesy moment where Thorin embraces Bilbo and tells him how wrong he was. Oh how I never saw that coming.<br/><br/>How terribly convenient that when they everyone is going to die, for no reason apparent, a bunch of magical flying over-sized birds come and save them who had not been mentioned or hinted off previous to the novel. They just swoop in and save the day. Right. Oh and the tree that they were all clinging on decided to fall off the huge cliff right after everyone gets off it. Yeah.<br/><br/>The amount of times I saw people clinging onto the edges of cliffs at their peril in this film was not funny. This is the 21st Century, I thought we could come up with some more exciting situations? How strange that these magical birds decided to leave them in the distance of the mountain. But don't worry, everyone saw that coming. Where are they going to be dropped off I wonder? It didn't take anyone longer than three seconds to think 'I bet it's the mountain they need to get to' <br/><br/>Cue the grumbles around the people in the cinema around me, grunts and whispers of 'how convenient'. Yes convenient, but not convenient enough to drop them off AT the mountain. Let's leave them a good few days from it so we can squeeze another film and hundreds of millions out of it. <br/><br/>Yes, Martin Freeman is a fantastic actor. The rest didn't impress me though. Awful? No, no, But Richard Armitage I'm afraid does not convince me as an actor. A typical 'NOOOOOOOO!' when his father dies fairly early on in the movie. A poorly executed 'NOOOO' at that, talk about cheesy. I really thought we didn't get that type of stuff in high standard cinema anymore.<br/><br/>It wasn't just the predictability but as I mentioned the odds defying convenience with every time they are saved. I mean, things get pretty grim. No one gets hurt though, that would be too much to ask, right? How that when they go to the Elf kingdom to get the map read, there was like a 1 in 365 chance of them being on the right day to get it read. Of course they were. It's that simple.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were endless as well, going from one to another and it did become tiresome because they weren't the fantastic fight scenes we've been accustomed to in Lord of the Rings or any other film of late. The only difference between them was different foes. One with trolls, one with Orcs, one with Goblins, and some nasty dogs pop up now and then. Just when you think there may be some relief, and you can go back to the side of the film that is enjoyable, the dialog and the comedy, bang, enemies are coming out of nowhere and here we go again for fifteen minutes. I'm afraid it was one fight scene too many for my liking.<br/><br/>I can imagine a lot of people are fuming in anger at this review because of course we have the reputation of Lord of the Rings, Tolkien and Peter Jackson on the line. People may say 'but that's the story of the Hobbit!' Yes, that might be the story of the Hobbit, but so many things could have been done better. Less clichés, improved acting, fewer fight scenes or if not more creative ones, and maybe if possible a slightly shorter movie.<br/><br/>The Hobbit was a disappointment for me but I believe it's got it's good merits. I did enjoy parts of it. I don't think it will be as disappointing to the die hard Tolkien fans but if your like me and partial, not caring either way, it may not be what you were expecting."

","I was truly disappointed by this movie, although I could have seen it coming based on the decision to split up this (short) story in tree 3-hour movies. SLOW is the word to describe the first half (although ""very childish"" also comes to mind, especially comparing to the LOTR movies). The second half is just too much 3D action-overkill without any storyline whatsoever. There is really NO excitement in the movie at all, but maybe this is because you truly do not connect with the main characters (except maybe for Thorin). I was really hoping for Bilbo to get slaughtered brutelessly by one of the Nazgul after the first half our (although fair to say his acting did improve a bit later on in the movie). anyway sorry but the current 8,4 rating is really not justified!"

"thecrimmreaper","4","3","4","29 March 2015"," Peter Jackson tried too hard
","Overall, the first time I saw this movie I really enjoyed it, but after I read the book again talked to my friends and siblings about these movies, I realized that they weren't as good as I previously had thought. I think that they tried too hard to make something great. For starters, the CG seemed rushed and it just straight up didn't look as good as the Lord of the Rings movies did. It still looked good, but the trolls specifically didn't look like they were real creatures on the screen. Also, why did they add to the storyline? The whole business with Azog and all the other orcs was completely unnecessary and it didn't add anything extra into the story that was worth putting in. I used to defend this, saying that it would be too boring without this plot point, but I realized that it wouldn't have been because Peter Jackson would not have needed to add all of the walking. Taking out the orcs and the whole business with where Gandalf went when he left the dwarfs at the edge of the Mirkwood. If Gandalf saw Sauron at that fortress place he went to, why was he so surprised when he realized Sauron was back at the beginning of the Lord of the Rings. That was never explained. If he hadn't have gone to the trouble of trying to create a great masterpiece out of what is already a great masterpiece, he could have done this whole thing in two movies tops. Everything extra was unnecessary and makes big fans of the book cringe with embarrassment and annoyance."
"owen9825","7","3","4","22 December 2013"," overuse of deus ex machina
","The story was interesting, but the threat of danger became increasingly contrived for all the protagonists. Major disruptions turn out to be fairly inconsequential hickups in the quest to walk around to various unknown places (we never get to see a map) − part of a larger plan to steal some gold before anyone else does.<br/><br/>The costumes, lighting, cgi and acting were fantastic.<br/><br/>The character development of Bilbo consisted of little more than pondering the question of ""should I have stayed at home and relaxed or was it correct to be a waste of space for these dwarfs?""<br/><br/>Fans of this film will invariably use the book to justify the unappealing plot developments, but I felt that the film adaptation made its own share of contributions towards this film's status as an example in the gross overuse of deus ex machina."
"barkdoll","5","3","4","21 December 2013"," Very disappointing and distorted version of the Hobbit
","I grew up reading and rereading and loving the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. I enjoyed Jackson's Trilogy but I think Hobbit has suffered greatly in the translation from book to screen. The scene with Bilbo the burglar-to-be at Bag End and the dwarfs rivals the approach to the Enterprise (Star Trek: The Motion Picture, 1979) for being unnecessarily interminable. The escape sequence (cave of the Misty Mountain goblins) is so unrealistic that it becomes a ridiculous caricature of something out of Indiana Jones. To add insult to injury it is only part I of III. You've got to be kidding!!! The Hobbit is all of about 300 pages versus nearly 1500 pages for the Trilogy. This is simply gross money-mongering at the expense of the audiences. Sorry, I love Tolkien's The Hobbit just not The Hobbit Movie."
"arthelad","6","12","25","24 December 2012"," Bilbo meets 300
","From a spectator point of view, it is a poignant and enjoyable film. The image is perfect, effects are great, music very good, although some clichés here and there (dragon opens eye - boom - frightening music effect). A few scenes (the dwarfs arriving at Bag End and ensuing party) are wonderful.<br/><br/>From a reader who loves the book, it might be a little disappointing. Azog is a unconvincing Nemesis, sort of a surrogate for the Nazgul. The Necromancer brought to present eliminated the possibility of some scenes depicting Gandalf visiting Thorin's father in the dungeons, which would have been more related to the text. And the alterations goes on and on. In general, this first part of a unjustified trilogy - oh, sorry, of course it is justified, public will pay tickets 3 times instead of one - is a continuous battle scene in Hollywood cliché style. It is like the director didn't credited Tolkien's material for being enough convincing, and went for the easy path - a commercial one.<br/><br/>Going with my 4 years little boy to see it, the hilarious part was that he was quite afraid of Gandalf and the dwarfs, while some of the monsters didn't had the same effect (probably because they were trashed by the heroes).<br/><br/>My conclusion is that is a movie worth seeing for the fun of it, but who cannot replace the book or even do justice to it. When we got out I noticed an Anna Karenina poster, and could't help myself thinking, is it also an ""ameliorated"" Hollywood version? Does she falls for a vampire? Does she kicks ass with some phony martial arts moves and using some special gadgets? Will she raise after the train crashes her, as an indestructible robot? Who knows..."
"shadowtramp","5","12","25","22 December 2012"," CGI kills it
","This movie lasts 169 minutes. About half of this time is wasted for some annoying computer generated 3D images. 10 or 20 minutes more are left for stunning views of mountains. Which I actually liked a lot. And the rest is beautiful.<br/><br/>The first thing one should understand this movie is not a rendition of the book ¨Hobbit¨. It is a kind of prequel to Lord of the Rings trilogy made by Peter Jackson that is loosely based on the book.<br/><br/>And this prequel is just great. All the key moments are made to the greatest standards. My only rant is about tree-hanging scene which suffer from the same ailment as the rest of the movie - it is made to last way too long.<br/><br/>And this brings me back to my vote. I vote 5 since only half of this movie worth watching. And it is better by far to watch it home where you can skip this irrelevant CGI."
"murtaza_mma","9","4","6","20 April 2014"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The swashbuckling first installment in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy—the much awaited prequel series to the ubiquitously acclaimed The Lord of the Rings Trilogy—based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, or There and Back Again. The trilogy's second and the third installments viz. ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" and ""The Hobbit: There and Back Again"" are scheduled to release in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey presents the first part of the quest undertaken by an artless hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and a band of vagrant dwarfs to help the latter reclaim their lost kingdom from the clutches of a fiendish dragon named Smaug. During the course of the journey Bilbo and company must always remain wary of the dangers lurking in the shadowy avenues of the Middle-earth. And the sooner they learn to trust each other's instincts the better would be the odds of their survival.<br/><br/>In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson once again shows why he is hailed in the film circles as an auteur par excellence. When it comes to the fantasy genre Jackson truly has no equal. An Unexpected Journey serves to be a visual spectacle of a very unique kind, one that appeals both to the soul and the intellect. While one is dazzled by the movie's visual sumptuousness, it's quite difficult to overlook the emotional subtext—most evident in Bilbo's homesickness and the plight of the dwarfs who have been driven out of their rightful dwellings by a ferocious usurper. It's indeed awe-inspiring to see the way Jackson manages to strike the right kind of balance between style and substance.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an exhilarating cinematic experience for viewers of all ages and groups. Vintage Jackson, the movie serves to be a fine specimen of masterful storytelling. Unlike most modern-day movies of its kind, An Unexpected Journey never lets story take the backseat and while technology plays a pivotal part the real emphasis is always on the movie's plot. Most of the sequences in the movie are beautifully crafted. The one in which Bilbo encounters the ever so spiteful Gollum remains my absolute favorite. While the movie's use of CGI and VFX is quite exemplary in itself the 3D and HFR effects serve to be a real icing on the cake that makes the movie quite unique even in comparison to its predecessors. Jackson manages to elicit worthy performances from his entire cast of actors. An Unexpected Journey has set the ball rolling for the final two installments of the trilogy, but what still remains to be seen is whether it would be possible for Jackson and team to match the success of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, both from the financial as well as critical point of view?<br/><br/>A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"Vasilis_Tsiardakas","5","4","6","1 February 2014"," Disappointing
","Well having watched The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, i was reluctant to watch this movie and i now stand vindicated.<br/><br/>It is just a boring movie, with no plot and the characters are so fake. The Return Of The King was made in 2003 and their FX were far more realistic than this one.<br/><br/>The goblins are like characters from the Shrek, and the orcs are so fake that you think that you are watching a cartoon. The dwarfs look like characters created on PC and not like real actors and the (few) battle scenes make you wanna cry. When somebody is stabbed, the swords ""magically clean themselves"" so there is no blood on their blades."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","8","4","6","7 September 2013"," The soaring imagination of man...again
","When I watched this film at the theatre, I was underwhelmed. Not that it was a bad movie, but it just didn't seem up to the standards of the previous ""Lord Of The Rings"" series. Now, at home, watching it on Blu-Ray, I am changing my view.<br/><br/>First of all, like many, at the theatre I found the faster film speed to be very harsh. Here at home, I find it brings a welcome clarity to the picture, and not a bit harsh.<br/><br/>Second, I am now realizing what I didn't like as much about the script. The ultimate goal of the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy seemed fairly obvious from early on. It seems to me that unless you've read ""The Hobbit"" (which I haven't), it's not as obvious what the ultimate goal is here.<br/><br/>I do think the film series sometimes suffers a bit from an overabundance of special effects. Think about the scenes in this film where thousands of Orcs are attacking a little band of the good guys. Hundreds of Orcs die during the battle, but not one of good guys, even though they falls thousands of feet into a cave-canyon, even though rock giants are throwing boulders that could crush them. Maybe could we have a good guy die once in a while? It's difficult to critique the acting in this film...because there's way too much reliance on running and fighting, and not enough on good acting. Although, there is some very good acting here. Of course, everyone's favorite character -- Gandalf -- is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen. For me personally, he made me want to see all these films! But here, Martin Freeman also shines as Bilbo Baggins. In some ways the story really is about Bilbo...and toward the end of the film I couldn't help think of that saying, ""Today you are a a man!"" Cate Blanchett is beautiful as Galadriel, an elf and the co-ruler of Lothlórien, but her screen time is minimal. Hugo Weaving is good as Elrond, the Elven Lord of Rivendell. Ian Holm is around early in the film as the old Bilbo Baggins, and I enjoy his performances. Elijah Wood is also around for a bit as Frodo Baggins, though this is not really his film. Andy Serkis again plays Gollum, a character that always reminds me of Peter Lorre. As for the rest of the characters, the heavy makeup and special effects make it tough to determine how good their acting really is.<br/><br/>There's no question in mind about why I enjoy these films -- the soaring imagination of man. And, this film is another example of that!"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","4","6","26 June 2013"," It's nice to have a blockbuster that doesn't rush, but sometimes you wish it would to actually give the adventure of the story some momentum.
","Missing The Lord of the Rings trilogy in the cinema is one of my biggest film related regrets. Granted, when I finally saw them a few years later, I dragged myself through a Fellowship and Two Towers VHS and couldn't stand them. However, after I got into film, I gave them another chance and saw Return of the King for the first time on DVD with the extended editions and although I'm still not much of a fan of the themes and mythology, it is a jaw-dropping technical marvel and worth it for the spectacle. I rewatched them one more time just before The Hobbit and they continue to grow on me, this time, the storytelling of The Two Towers got to me deeply (and for some reason, the cinematography is so much stronger in that film than the other two). I always wonder what I'd be like as a person if I did see The Lord of the Rings on the big screen as so film fans of my generation got into film by seeing them earlier. Although admittedly they would've been far too scary for my 9 year old self so maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed them in the first place. Anyway, I had one expectation for The Hobbit - spectacle.<br/><br/>On that one basis, The Hobbit delivers. It isn't the same as The Lord of the Rings with a distinct lack of sweeping landscapes and intricate models (although it does have the makeup and production design), but it doesn't look too heavily Avatar inspired where it could've been flat and bland. It's not particularly special, but it's worth watching in the cinema, particularly in end of the second act with the Goblin caves even if there's some shaky CGI. However, the storytelling is another thing. On one hand, The Hobbit is one of those stories that takes the most basic formula for an adventure story and invents things to fill in the gaps, on the other, that method is very sloppy. Just judging Jackson's films and not Tolkien's books; it's an interesting approach, particularly for the intricate detail and rich mythology to go with it, but as an early scene in the film demonstrates where the group of dwarfs are saved by Bilbo by stalling for time, this is a technique that Jackson seems to apply to every sequence. It's nice to have a blockbuster that doesn't rush, but sometimes you wish it would to actually give the adventure of the story some momentum. <br/><br/>It also does have a tendency to disconnect with the characters too much for an exploration of the mythology, which is only a problem when it feels like we haven't seen Bilbo for a good half hour. It's a shame since if it focused on Bilbo for longer, Martin Freeman's mannerisms would be more welcome, but they seem contrived and bizarre, devoid of its potential charm. Unfortunately, some of the conflicts and sequences aren't as creative as they could've been, particularly with the pale orc and wolves, which now feel generic. It's a decent film, but the only scene with any weight is the scene with Gollum, which although it is sometimes hard to follow, it's utterly captivating. Though perhaps that's just because it's deeply rooted into the nostalgia of 10 years ago, which the score also achieves through its welcome revisiting of the original Lord of the Rings soundtrack. This first part is a considerable step down from that trilogy, but I didn't really expect anything more. I may see parts 2 and 3 in the cinema as well, perhaps I'll experiment and try the 3D and 48fps although I really don't think I'll be a fan. We'll see. There's plenty of time before then.<br/><br/>6/10"
"ebossert","5","4","6","12 June 2013"," The lack of intermediate goals is a problem.
","I'm having difficulty sitting through these recent Peter Jackson films without getting bored out of my mind. Maybe I should just skip the rest, but virtually every one of them is tauted as one of the greatest films of all time, so my curiosity gets the best of me. In terms of positives, ""The Hobbit"" has a good lead actor (Martin Freeman) and the opening 30 minutes are engaging, but much of the rest of the film drags in the most painful of ways. There are a few decent (albeit short) fights during the middle (with a few longer fights near the end), but there are too many side plots and too much filler material to slug through. The script is completely unfocused and unengaging. <br/><br/>I think one of Peter Jackson's big problems is his failure to set-up intermediate goals for the protagonists. Instead, he sets up a long-term goal and has the protagonists walk around for 6 hours while they fend off random attacks. This creates a monotonous, dull framework that cripples the enjoyability of the film.<br/><br/>Compare this to Clash of the Titans (1981), which laid out a series of fascinating obstacles that were accomplished throughout the course of one 2-hour film. <br/><br/>--Capturing and taming Pegasus. <br/><br/>--Seeking the blind Stygian witches and coercing information out of them. <br/><br/>--Venturing to the Gorgon island and defeating the canine guardian Dioskilos. <br/><br/>--Entering Medusa's lair, defeating her, and retrieving her head. <br/><br/>--Defeating Calibos and his giant scorpions. <br/><br/>--Facing the Kraken. <br/><br/>I think Clash of the Titans is a true epic adventure because the long-term goal requires a plethora of intermediate accomplishments. They're not just arbitrary dangers that the protagonists encounter along the way. Many of these goals are necessary steps that must be taken in order to achieve the final long-term goal. When all is said and done, I can look back and admire the difficulty and complexity of the journey. Each individual success becomes a memorable event. <br/><br/>Such is not the case with The Hobbit, which basically has the protagonists walk around and fight villains without any interesting identifiable purpose other than reaching the dragon's lair – an event that will likely occur in the 6th hour of the trilogy (if we're lucky!). It just feels like a series of meaningless clashes that become conflicts because the protagonists were not lucky enough to avoid them along the way to reaching their long-term goal. The obstacles feel arbitrary and there's no anticipation or build-up to any of them. There's no sense of accomplishment to the protagonists' actions. <br/><br/>After finishing this movie, it felt like the characters made very little progress. I suppose they got a little closer to the dragon's lair, but after watching 3 hours of film I expected a bit more detail and drive regarding the primary quest. Near the end I remembered that there was a dragon in the story. I had completely forgotten. <br/><br/>The action choreography is not impressive enough to make up for any of the flaws. The escape thru the lair of the Ballsack Chin King is pretty good, but a bit too tension-less. Gollum shows up and is annoying as usual. Gandalf uses the same three tricks that he used in LOTR. Can Peter Jackson please give us a few cool magic spells for a change? I don't think I've ever seen such a lazy attempt at wizardry in my entire life."
"Vinegaroon3","7","10","20","4 January 2013"," Entertaining...but definitely beginning to trade substance for spectacle...
","I will say upfront that I enjoyed this film. As a definite fan of the LOTR series, it was nice to see many of the characters again in a different adventure. The continuity they achieved in the appearance of the characters was surprising...particularly considering twelve years had elapsed between the productions. That is a long time, and it was fortunate that none of the essential characters had gained weight or changed in other ways that would have destroyed the illusion of continuity, particularly considering that ""The Hobbit"" was supposed to have taken place 60 years before the first installment of the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>This is the basis of my concern about ""The Hobbit"" and the direction the trilogy appears to be taking. The Hobbit trilogy is based on one Tolkien book, that in its entirety is considerably shorter and a more simple story than the shortest of the three books of the LOTR trilogy. I fear this was nothing more than a blatant attempt to wring the most profit possible from The Hobbit franchise. No matter how poor The Hobbit trilogy may or may not turn out to be, it is virtually guaranteed to be a money maker simply by riding the coat tails of the popularity of LOTR.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed The Hobbit, it did confirm many of the suspicions I explained above. What made the LOTR trilogy such a great series was primarily complex and compelling story, and sympathetic character development. Yes, the spectacular visuals were compelling as well, but they complemented the story without dominating it. Contrary to many viewers, I felt ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was the best of the LOTR series. The other two films, while strong in their own right, gradually began to trade story and character for eye popping visuals.<br/><br/>The Hobbit takes this trend further still. Some story elements were added that never appeared in the book, which I'm sure was practically essential to pull a film trilogy out of such a short and simple novel. But The Hobbit was also right on the bubble of being a film that was spectacle and little more. Film makers the world over still have apparently failed to learn that spectacular CGI will not carry an audience's interest in a 2+ hours movie. The Hobbit was very close to falling into that trap....but not quite there.<br/><br/>So in summary, I enjoyed The Hobbit but potential viewers (particularly fans of LOTR) should be aware it is a film that is long on spectacle and short on substance when compared to the prior trilogy. And I for one am more than a bit concerned that the next two Hobbit films might slip further down that slope and become little more than bloated CGI extravaganzas....<br/><br/>Time will tell I guess."

","Despite being a big fan of Peter Jackson's earlier work, this time I must admit that the story did not captivated me as I expected and leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>It was hard for me to connect emotionally with the story and get excited with the main characters' mission . I feel that the film tried to integrate many elements at once, and that could saturates the story with to much information disturbing those who are not familiar with the overall story. the film has splendid moments that captivated me and others where it feels slow. It could be found some filler scenes,and although I enjoy the film, I got the final impression that the plot was unnecessarily expanded."
"CinemaClown","Null","10","20","28 December 2012"," Middle-Earth Comes Alive In Breathtaking Detail, Once Again.
","J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings did cement Tolkien's legacy into the annals of literature but it wasn't the novel that really started the Middle-Earth mythology. Instead, it began years ago when Tolkien wrote a fantasy novel called The Hobbit, a children's book very lighthearted & innocent in its tone compared to its much darker successor.<br/><br/>Decades later, at the dawn of the new millennium, The Lord of the Rings made a historical transition to the silver screen. And so when the filmmakers decided to adapt The Hobbit on film canvas as well, they didn't only have to make it reasonably faithful to its source material but also had a daunting task of living up to the mighty successful on-screen adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>And thanks to the mixed reviews this film received at its time of release, which as a result dented my expectations from it quite heavily, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turned out to be an absolute feast for the eyes & is one hell of an on-screen adaptation of Tolkien's work which, in my opinion, is unfortunately marred by only one major drawback; its inevitable comparison to The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Serving as a prequel to the events depicted in The Lord of the Rings, An Unexpected Journey is the first chapter in the planned trilogy & follows the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is tricked by Gandalf the Grey into joining the company of thirteen dwarfs headed by Thorin Oakenshield in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain & reclaim their lost Kingdom of Erebor from Smaug the dragon.<br/><br/>Expanding a relatively slim book into three major feature films when the entire story could've been told in a single film did allow Peter Jackson the opportunity to milk almost every event of the book for all its worth but it also robbed the film of a steadier pace. Nevertheless, Jackson's direction once again brings Middle-Earth alive in all its majesty & he does a neat job in bringing this chapter as close as possible to his magnum opus.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, the production design team does a fabulous job in bringing back the homely Bag End, the evergreen Shire & the dazzling Rivendell on the big screen plus the new sets are equally stunning to look at. Cinematography captures each frame in meticulous detail, editing is a let down this time & unlike The Lord of the Rings, even the extended edition doesn't add much to the overall experience.<br/><br/>The visual effects of The Lord of the Rings commenced a new era for VFX in film & was a groundbreaking feat of its time. The Hobbit unfortunately brings nothing new to the table & its heavy reliance on CGI over practical effects robs the film of the grounded realism the previous trilogy had. Lastly, the film is beautifully scored from start to finish & marks another glorious achievement in Howard Shore's career.<br/><br/>Featuring an ensemble cast of new & reprising actors, Martin Freeman & Ian McKellen deliver outstanding performances as Bilbo Baggins & Gandalf the Grey, respectively. There are thirteen dwarfs in this nearly three hours long film & yet only one of them gets a proper introduction. However, it's Andy Serkis once again who steals the show as Gollum plus the riddle sequence between him & Bilbo is the only moment when this film felt as magical as The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, despite its bloated length & other inconsistencies, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is still an unexpectedly impressive commencement of another Middle-Earth adventure. There are few missteps along the road but most of its footing is spot-on. Faithfully adapted, wonderfully crafted & cleverly concluded, An Unexpected Journey may not be as memorable or spellbinding as The Lord of the Rings but it nevertheless begins The Hobbit film series on a right note & it'll be very interesting to see where it journeys from here."

","It's a mixed bag, but as a fan of LOTR this film was a bit of a disappointment for me. There were some well-scripted scenes and welcomed additions to the book, and some good acting, but my main gripe with this film is that the action scenes have become ridiculous and I'm surprised that Peter Jackson succumbed to this industry trend where the main characters survive impossible 1 in a million situations. Worse is the fact that many of the invented scenes were of this nature, extending the film to well over 2 hours and requiring 3 visits. Is it really possible to fall hundreds of feet and survive without a scratch? Or survive huge boulders being thrown all around you while you stand on a moving mountain? Fantasy this may be, but I'd call it ridiculous. Peter Jackson, and other movie makers, should perhaps look to The Game of Thrones for more realistic action and fight scenes. I don't mind if a film veers from the book if it is to cut short or to make connections - but this film adds scenes to bore us to tears with unnecessary, impossible and repetitive action scenes. I won't be going to see the next installment in 1 year - I'll wait until it arrives on satellite TV, such is my disappointment."

","Don't believe the reviews. I was floored with how excellent this film is. After reading reviews, feared it would make me vomit in 3D, or be ridiculous and/or overly long.<br/><br/>None of the above. Charming, stunning, beautifully crafted. Did not feel any ill effects from 3D version. Very true to the book. The entire audience (a mix of ages, ethnic groups, some LOTR fans, others with no Tolkien experience) around us enjoyed it as well, many applauded.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit but in fact the everyman we identify with along the journey. Dwarfs are played as funny but gritty warriors,all interesting. Few actors could make a noble hero of Thorin, this part well-cast also. This film's Gollum is more physically life-like, incredible to watch.<br/><br/>Some scenes are truly gorgeous, more real-looking than LOTR, unforgettable. Especially near the end (eagles), a stunner. Regarding the reviewers: in time they will wonder at their pettiness. This is great film-making, a great classic of a great classic."
"carpenterfulci","7","19","44","16 December 2012"," Enjoyable, but very flawed
","Let me tell right from the start that I generally hate anything Hollywood produces today, and that I found the LOTR good bur very flawed. Not anywhere near to the masterpieces some would like us to believe. Jackson's style is heavy-handed, not nearly as poetic as he wants to be, just ""epic"" because that's what people want these days, this word almost replacing the word ""good""...<br/><br/>So needless to say, I wasn't very optimistic for The Hobbit. The book is a count, and I feared the movie would be going too much on the ""epic"" side, and would not be a simple and likable story.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what happened. Although I still recommend the movie. So first of all, the good: - the landscapes are great as usual - the Gollum scene, the one I expected the most in this movie, is very, very good. Gollum is a bit more scary than in LOTR, a good change since I always thought he almost became a comic relief in these movies. - the beginning wasn't as long as I feared. The dwarfs song scene is very well done. - I liked the look of the dwarfs fortress, especially the treasure room. It felt gloomy and mysterious. - Bilbo and Thorin are both well acted, and likable. - Radagast was somewhat good. Although I didn't imagine him like that at all in the book, he's a good character, and has engaging scenes.<br/><br/>Now the bad: - The main problem of this movie is that you don't relate to the characters. I know it's hard to make 13 developed dwarf characters, but Jackson could have made it better IMO. There are some dwarfs I can't even remember the face. It would have been better if we actually felt invested in their quest, but I did not. - This problem added to the fact that they seem invincible in the action scenes, the movie has no tension at all. No character is in any danger the whole movie, or at least you don't feel that way. - Too much CGI for the orcs. The battle scene in their town under the mountain was ludicrous: the dwarfs were just fighting impersonal goblins. Again, no tension when you can't relate to the characters. It felt like a video game scene. - Gandalf: 2 problems here. First, the makeup: it's really, really bad. He was far better in the LOTR movies. Second, he's too much of a fighter. Gandalf is supposed to be a wise magician, not Conan the Barbarian beheading enemies left and right. - The whole white orc storyline is useless and feels very far fetched. I didn't believe for one second that Thorin had a grudge with him. - The movie was too long. More is not necessarily better. Jackson should have cut the white orc storyline - Christopher Lee is annoying as Saroumane. He feels like an annoying grandpa, not the ""noble"" villain he was in the trilogy. And Jackson makes it too obvious that he's already on Sauron's side. - TOO MUCH HUMOUR! It kills the tension! The trolls scene is a disaster on that matter. Is it a comedy or an adventure movie? Why do they feel the need to make jokes when their lives are at stake? It really disconnected me from the movie. - The insistence on Throin's defiance towards Bilbo is just too much. Although it's actually justified since Bilbo is a lot more useless than in the book. MINOR SPOILER: The reconciliation scene is ridiculous. Bilbo just saved Thorin's life, but the next scene is a typical Hollywood cliché scene, rather than a simple and spontaneous reconciliation. - Last but not least, the ""epic"" side. Jackson ties the dwarfs quest to the Sauron storyline, but it feels very far-fetched. The argument that Smaug would be a dreadful asset in Sauron's hands is not enough to justify the interest in the dwarfs quest. They should really have stuck to a simple story rather than this intricate bs.<br/><br/>Now, with all that said, I still recommend the movie because while it's very flawed, it's still head and shoulder above the rest of the *beep* Hollywood blockbusters. Not a masterpiece, not even in the league of great movies, but still enjoyable. If you like action you should like this one. If you expect a movie faithful to the book, you will be disappointed since while it follows the story, the tone is very different, and IMO, not for the better."

","Blew the critics, many people on my country too said the same thing, it isn't in the book. What the heck? What book? the hobbit, take look at the Unfinished stories, the book itself written in 1937, the history of the hobbit, read it too, and you will see there is a story of a White Ork.<br/><br/>BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST what did Peter Jackson done right?<br/><br/>He kept the songs, most people don't know the significance, how many of you fellow readers started to sing when Richard Armitage started to sing the misty mountain? I have sang the song with the dwarfs, I started to laugh when they sang That's What Bilbo Baggins Hates, I was fallowing the beat with my feet too. The troll song was there too. This is one of the many things MR. Jackson showed us.<br/><br/>MOST IMPORTANTLY, they talk in their own language, Orks,Ogres, Goblins, Trolls all the abominable monsters you saw can talk, they have their own dark language and guess what? They talk in that language, elves talk in elvish, and Orks talk in Orkish and that's my friends is authenticity and many directors ignore that.<br/><br/>The First 20 Minutes of the film, took me back a decade ago, the first time when I saw Fellowship Of The Ring and made me took a deep breath like I have returned home after a long trip and I felt good.<br/><br/>OK film is great but not perfect, how and why, I think there was to much action at the end of the film, to much running around, and hacking and whacking, I don't know maybe I'm getting old but I missed few scenes in that chaos, other than that this was a fantastic film, with fantastic writing and with a fantastic job to put to screen."

","Your ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" movie guide.<br/><br/>First, for those of you who LOVED the Lord of the Rings, which was a rich, wonderful ""adult level"" read in their original book form...remember that The Hobbit was a much lighter read aimed more at the child or young adult (in book form).<br/><br/>Having said that, I am hearing of ""critics"" viewing the movie as not as well developed (as LoTR) and with many ""made up"" scenes...<br/><br/>...I am so tired of ""critics"" who don't know the history of the product they are reviewing""...<br/><br/>...every scene I did indeed remember from something I read about Tolkiens Middle Earth. While not all of them were ""directly"" from The Hobbit, they are on par with the time-line and come from sources like The Silmarillion. <br/><br/>Plus, The Hobbit ""the MOVIE"" is NOT The Hobbit ""the BOOK"". It ""includes the book"" within its frame of reference but is also designed to give a much broader stroke of Middle Earth as Tolkein envisioned it. Peter Jackson is also trying to neatly create a tie-in for a smooth transition from The Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings movies.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson is the ultimate Hobbit and Hobbit fan; as was I in my youth. What I have liked about all his Tolkien movies is the fact that he seems to have been a fan of many of the artist renderings I enjoyed as a young man (and collected) of Middle Earth. The most notable is the Brothers Hildebrandt. In fact, Gollum's grotto jumped right out of the screen at me as a direct childhood memory...including the shape of the rock on his lake center island. <br/><br/>While there are a few slow areas as Peter develops the complex web he is trying to create, the overall movie worked very well.<br/><br/>Plus I saw it in HFR (High Frame Rate) 3D, which I would highly recommend (even over sound quality). Instead of the normal frame rate of 24fps as most movies are made by, this was filmed at 48fps. Why? The result is a much smoother image which gives the human eye the ability to pick up detail even more than just 1080p itself. Frame rate is not high definition in itself, but the ability to feed more information to the human brain per second. It looked ""very"" life like. My only negative comment was it also, to me at least, appeared overly ""bright"". Perhaps that was a wrong setting with the projectionist as this was the first showing (ever) of this technology. In that regard it did not match the lighting of the earlier movies (at all). It came across a little cartoonish...hopefully they will fix this either at the theater or when the final Blu-ray or Red-ray DVD's come out.<br/><br/>Still, even though this is only part I of III, the audience applauded at the end (rare enough) and I walked away having enjoyed myself immensely. Peter Jackson, the ultimate Hobbit, has done it again. :)<br/><br/>Happy Holidays!"
"Reno-Rangan","10","13","28","14 December 2012"," The Return of the Epic to all the Epics
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)<br/><br/>First I like to start with that I am one hell 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy fan freak, it is EPIC to all the EPICS in human history of filmdom. I voted many movies for 10 outa 10 but by far LOTR stays in highest peak point on that list. I never compare HOBBIT to LOTR because the time and technology differentiate both the movie (trilogy) and I request you all not to do that. Another solid reason is that I saw LOTR as plain live action graphic movie but saw HOBBIT a decade later in 3D with advance CGI technics in it.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about 'An Unexpected Journey', The first installment of 'The Hobbit' trilogy which tells the untold adventurous story of Bilbo Baggins, the ring holder, which take place 60 years early to the actual LOTR, it also tells how Bilbo Baggins ends with the precious Ring in his pocket that everyone in the Middle Earth was looking for it over the centuries. As usual stunning visuals, Peter Jackson did hell great job by handing the massive characters/cast/role and also got what he wanted from CGI technicians, It was not gigantic cast like LOTR trilogy though. In fact I have seen only 33.333...% of the movie so far I mean I yet to see other two parts (66.666...%) which make it a trilogy so my rating for this movie is temporary till next two years.<br/><br/>The movie begins with slow dramatic style, introducing all the characters one after one otherwise some could get mix up to identify all the dwarfs who look alike. And then little fun get pass through middle of the movie with small-small adventures then begins second half where most of the real adventures take place which kick starts with mountain Trolls. Extraordinary 3D effects with few great pop-ups, some action sequences were simply breathtaking especially one in underground Goblin city is treat for eyes specially if you see it in 3D version, expected ultra slow motion images Like what we see in cricket, sadly I did not get chance to see the movie in 48fps, that really scuks as being LOTR fan, great to see 500 years old freaky, an aggressive Gollum in 3D, you gonna witness the best Gollum in technically, Andy Serkis did great job in his short phase. There is a brief scene where this movie meets 'Fellowship of the Ring' where Gollum lose his Ring in a dark cave and that situation was bit strange and different than what we saw in LOTR may be because it was brief like i said before. Meet between them, Bilbo Baggins and Gollum was more like funny simultaneously frighting too, specially kids may feel that. Background score was so great throughout the movie like previous trilogy, even some songs too. When movie ended I left cinema hall like everyone else but felt I still wanted another hour of it, I was forced to leave the place :( How many of you will agree me, it started slowly but ended strongly, that's why all this drama of me.<br/><br/>In world cinema, there will be always some characters which will remain in people's mind forever, like the Joker, Jack Sparrow, Dark Vander etc, like that Galdalf is for LOTR, of course including Gollum, Ian McKellen was so awesome in all the four movies, without him or replace of him is like a bowl of curd rice without a Piece of pickle.<br/><br/>Overall an excellent standard movie, must see in big screen with 3D version specially if you are a film freak you should not miss it, some people might have not get satisfied with movie but all I can say is still another two is yet to come so it will make difference at least then. Now all we can do is wait.....<br/><br/>10/10"

","I was 12 when I read the entire work from JRR Tolkien for the first time. It was a revelation to me, a new world fill with magic, heroism, beauty and epic battles. Those stories are all about how we can all stand up and bond together in front of the most dangerous and perillous ennemies that threatens our lives or our family( death, disease, war etc...). These books inspired me throughout all my life and knowing the source material for this film I didn't anticipate it at all like a LOTR bis.<br/><br/>Does the hobbit live up to my expectations ? YES and so more ! I felt ""at home"" immediately and it was like reuniting with all friends. The 40 or so first minutes may seem stretch for many but in my opinion necessary to introduce the quest and the dwarfs. One scene in particular is already cult it's shown in the trailers and loved by many : the dwarfs singing in front of the chimney. Wenhever I heard that song I feel shiver down my spine and goosebumps !<br/><br/>The journey is filled with beauty as we can see again the gorgeous landscape of Middle earth(New Zealand) but with dangers that leads to great actions.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch as every main actors fits perfectly their character : sir Ian Mckellen IS Gandalf forever in my heart, Martin Freeman IS Bilbo like I never could imagine him and Richard Armitage IS Thorin Oakenshield in all it's heroic glory.<br/><br/>There are so many things to say about this movie but at the end of the day all I can say is go see it and make your own opinion. This film is long and yet entertaining and as it is the hobbit already win it's challenge : to reunite the work of JRR Tolkien."

","After reading mixed critics I begun to worry.<br/><br/>You shouldn't. Critics do not like it because they keep comparing it with LOTR, and it is not. This is an adventure written on a kids book. The story is lighter, and the only thing that LOTR and this have in common is the place and the ring.<br/><br/>I watched it on 48fps and I really liked it. It made 3d more appealing and everything beautiful. The only problem of 48fps was that it was so real, that sometimes you could notice cgi.<br/><br/>But the technology is not the film, just the media and I am reviewing the film (although I liked 48fps)<br/><br/>The story is faithful to the book and brought me back to a place I thought I would never visit again. Just being back in middle earth is amazing.<br/><br/>Martin as Bilbo, Richard as Thorin and Ian as Gandalf reprise their roles with excellence. And thanks to the division into three films we get to know more about the other dwarfs and care about them.<br/><br/>The riddles in the dark scene is outstanding. And Howard Shore's composition is brilliant as ever.<br/><br/>I could not have wanted more from this film. A fun, and amazing comeback to a great adventure to come."

There is not one single scene in this movie that I would take out, I think the length of the movie is totally justifiable with the content provided, I thought the pace was perfect. The casting of this movie and the voice acting for CGI characters are absolutely spot on. How often do we come across fantasy movies? Rarely.

"Therut","7","21","50","12 December 2012"," ""Thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread""
","I have high respect for Peter Jackson for managing to direct three great films based on the Lord of The Rings (abbreviated as LOTR from here on) by J.R.R. Tolkien, a fantasy epic that some deemed unfilmable. So, years ago, I was naturally excited to hear that Jackson had decided to produce adaptation of another Tolkien masterpiece, LOTR prequel ""Hobbit - there and back again"", and had chosen Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy films, Pan's Labyrinth) as the director.<br/><br/>Del Toro worked on the film for a while but apparently thought it was too big a challenge and left the project. Peter Jackson saved the production by once again taking the role of director, and at first intended to make a two film adaptation of the Tolkien novel. Whatever the reason was for Jackson's initial refusal of sitting on the director's seat - perhaps he was busy with King Kong or tired as he mentions many times in the DVD extras of the latter two of the LOTR films, or just thought Hobbit was best left for someone else - I think it would have better been a decision to keep.<br/><br/>With the ""Hobbit - an unexpected journey"" it feels like Peter Jackson is trying to play safe by bringing us a very LOTR-feeling experiene, with similar grandiose music playing to similar helicopter shot imagery of a fellowship travelling through majestic landscapes, and what seem to me be dwarf versions of Aragorn (Thorin) and Legolas (Kili). The film lacks distinct creative spark and soul, and it seems like it's trying to suck the soul out of the LOTR films. I think Peter was very uninspired, perhaps because of tiredness, and he uses LOTR as a director's reference point far too much. To me, ""An unexpected Journey"" is a dwarfed down version of the first LOTR film in many respects.<br/><br/>Instead of two films as originally planned, we get three. Tolkien's Hobbit is a relatively short fairytale, shorter than any of the novels in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Three 3 hour films are justified for the Lord of the Rings, but not for the Hobbit. At 169 minutes, ""Unexpected Journey"" is just too long. ""There and back again"" feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread, to quote Bilbo Baggins from the first Lord of The Rings film.<br/><br/>For the first hour or so, not much happens in the way of plot advancement: A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins receives thirteen dwarf guests and one wizard and they eat. The high points of the first hour are a prologue about the Dwarf kingdom and a dwarf chant. The rest of the film is mostly about chases, cliffhangers, charges, and yells. They are delivered with pompous instrumental music and sinister visuals that would have perhaps worked if Tolkien's Hobbit was an epic with apocalyptic tones like Lord of The Rings. However, Tolkien's Hobbit is a fairytale about thirteen dwarfs and a hobbit and a wizard on a way to reclaim a treasure and home from a dragon.<br/><br/>Tolkien himself has stated that he created the Lord of the Rings because there was no national epic for the Great Britain. Hobbit, in contrast, is more similar to the fairy tales he created as bedtime stories for his children. The Hobbit story does have epic elements but for this film at least, it is my opinion that there is a mismatch between content and execution here.<br/><br/>One of the big challenges for the Hobbit was to make the thirteen dwarfs of the tale work cinematically. The Dwarf challenge is similar to the one Walt Disney faced with the Snow White. With major film length limitations and lots of dwarfs, Disney decided that the film would get a boost of liveliness if each of the dwarfs were given a distinct personality, a caricature, and named after their characteristic.<br/><br/>As with Disney's Snow White, the dwarfs of Hobbit are very distinct from one another, but two major issues arise, at least for me. First is that they don't match my mental image of ""dwarf"". Regarding features like body language and mentality, the dirty dozen just feels too ""human"". I think Jackson missed a comical gold mine here. What is supposed to be fun in this film is that the dwarfs are really hungry, but that doesn't quite cut it, especially since there's no ""second breakfast"" kind of funny quips as with the hungry hobbits in the first LOTR film.<br/><br/>The second major issue has to do with the simple story of Tolkien which the film stays true to. As distinct as the dwarfs here are, it is all the more harrowing that the differences between the dwarfs that cost a lot of introductory time to establish, don't shape the story at all. Now if i watched the film carefully enough, the truth is that there are no twists or turns that would depend on the individualities of the dwarfs, except for one of them. For a short children's animation like Snow White that's not a major issue, but for a three hour film that's a major negative.<br/><br/>Basically all of the dwarf characters could be rolled into one, preferredly Thorin Oakenshield, the Aragorn of dwarfs and leader of the gang, without creating a need for Gollum-esque divided personality.<br/><br/>I have to balance the criticism by saying that Peter Jackson, a true craftsman and a technological innovator, is a perfectionist when it comes to creating worlds. Certain aspects of the film are really impressive when judged on their own, especially the visual design and it is also the reason why people who are not Tolkien fans might think this is a film worth seeing. I'm planning on watching the film for a second time in theatre with HFR technology to see if that brings a new level of immersion to an already impressive looking film."

"jonedney124","9","11","23","14 December 2012"," Not as good as LOTR but welcome back Jackson's Middle-Earth
","The Hobbit may not be as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy but then that is because it is inherently a weaker story. I would like to address certain criticisms I have often read: <br/><br/>(a) Length: Part of the reason for the length of the film is for scenes between characters that strengthen relationships, something mostly lacking from the book. If The Hobbit was done as one film, it would have to be 3 hours to remotely capture everything and even then it would be forced to leave out character for the sake of plot and pace. You would not get a ten minute Riddles in the Dark, you would get a four minute Riddles in the Dark, which would not be anywhere near as good (6 minutes less of Andy Serkis' Gollum). The structuring is more about character, showing how Bilbo becomes a hero and part of the Company for real. There is Thorin's back story, which gives a reason for the quest and more emotion to his character than the book. This may seem to hold the film up but in the long term, it serves the characters and overall story better as well as giving Richard Armitage something to sink his teeth into. One thing you can say about the Harry Potter films is they don't leave much time to take in the supporting roles played by Britain's best actors. By having the Necromancer storyline as well as more time to dwell on the dwarfs and Bilbo (played to perfection by Martin Freeman) across three films rather than one or two, it gives these actors more to do, which is worth the running time. Would you rather have a brisk 3-hour film with little character development or 3 films that give this story an epic scale and pathos as well as bridging to the Rings trilogy, taking in the wider ramifications for Middle-Earth of the quest? <br/><br/>(b)Humour: Personally I had no issue with the humour in this film. They weren't exactly laugh-out-loud moments but there were plenty of chuckles. Burping dwarfs are only to be expected (they are a rowdy bunch after all) and this is NOT a kid's film, despite the fact that it's based on a kid's book. Radagast the Brown is NOT the Tolkien equivalent of Jar Jar Binks, he isn't even in the film that much. The bunny sled might seem a tad over the top but I want oneThe trolls are amusing and stupid in the book and they are the same here, although this scene plays out quite differently to the book but keeps the silly humour of it and if anything, makes it funnier. <br/><br/>(c) Takes 40 minutes for them to leave Hobbiton: This is true but I was actually surprised at how quickly this opening section went. The prologue establishes Smaug's taking of Erebor and the Ian Holm-Elijah Wood prologue ties into the opening of Fellowship and leads very neatly into the beginning of the Hobbit. As the familiar music washes over you, it settles you back into the world of Middle-Earth and establishes older Bilbo as he prepares to leave Bag End again, stating that in many ways he is the same hobbit that set out all those years ago: one secretly craving adventure. Both dwarf songs are from the book, with 'Blunt the Knives' energetically performed as the dwarfs do the washing up and 'Misty Mountains' creating a quiet moment for the dwarfs to reflect on their journey and Bilbo to experience the moment as described in the book. It gives time for the dwarfs to establish their characters, although the first few who arrive individually come across more strongly than the final pile-up group but again, more character than the book dwarfs, some of whom are barely mentioned across the story. I found parts of the immediate section after leaving Hobbiton to be slower but not mind-numbingly boring slowness. <br/><br/>(d) Overuse of CGI: The Rings trilogy wasn't exactly light on CGI, was it? It is extremely impressive CGI, there were only a few moments, mainly when interacting with the real New Zealand environment that looked fake. The Goblin City is great to experience in 3D and the goblins are all mostly CGI but they're still being slain in variously cool styles, depending on the dwarf weaponry on display. The stone giants battle was one of the 'wow' moments in the film and Azog is motion capture, not just CGI. The Wargs are better than their Two Towers counterparts and there are some Orcs that are real, as there will be in the other two films based on behind the scenes footage. <br/><br/>(e) 3D: I haven't yet seen the 48fps but the IMAX 3D was generally impressive, although some parts, mainly sweeping shots were a bit blurred (this may have been the projectors however). <br/><br/>This is very much a film for the fans, with Howard Shore using plenty of old music as well as creating new pieces. The film is long but when you reach the end of it, you will find yourself surprised at how fast it goes and you'll be wanting the next film. This will probably be one of the most faithful adaptations of a book by the time the third film is done and the story of the Hobbit will be all the better for it. Tolkien wrote the extra stuff himself, even if he didn't put it into the book and Jackson, Walsh and Boyens have already added stuff to Lord of the Rings (Aragorn and Arwen) and how much better did that make the trilogy in terms of Aragorn's character? Critics need to stop moaning about the length of movies that are actually filling their running time with stuff worth watching."

","I was always a bigger fan of the Lord of the Rings than of the Hobbit. It's only logical: The Hobbit was written earlier, it's a children's story, it felt to me like it was a rather inconsistent story about dwarfs with a mission hopping from one plot obstacle to another like people go to random attractions in a fun park. However, I did enjoy the story! Still, it had some flaws. <br/><br/>Then the movie came out and it's absolutely brilliant. They added just the right things to give the story more 'balls' and increase the suspense, they were loyal to the concepts in the book that were most essential, ... They turned the book into a timeless adventure for a very wide range of viewers. <br/><br/>Like the Lord of the Rings was a meaningful story about 'carrying on', having the courage to fulfill your destiny, the importance of friendship and so much other timeless wisdom; the Hobbit was exactly that about 'having the courage to take the leap', leaving routine habits and taking a risk, taking off on a journey to freedom and adventure, to 'whatever doesn't kill you can only make you stronger', ... It especially appeals to us, tiny Belgians of Flanders, who are actually the real life versions of Hobbits, dying of old age in the exact same tiny village we grew up in, never taking risks, saving up money our entire lives just to put it in a sock under our mattress and pass it on to our children when we die, always worrying about money while we have this elaborate social backup system, never launching an idea that hasn't proved to be successful elsewhere first, etc. This is a true story, more so than some other dark and gritty realistic stories about family conflicts. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson gave this story exactly what it deserved. Azog gave it more force and 'necessity' and added more suspense, the dwarfs got more individual personalities (while in the book, they sometimes seem more like 'that bunch of dwarfs'), etc. An Unexpected Journey lifts the Hobbit up to a whole new level. <br/><br/>Of course, as one might expect, there are a lot of 'true fans' verbally demolishing this movie 'because it's nothing like the book'. It's probably the very same ones who thought The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a terrible movie adaptation just because Tom Bombadil was never mentioned. But although I have in fact, you don't need to study film and literature extensively at university to realise a movie is a completely different medium and that novels are not necessarily better than their film adaptations (e.g. The Chronicles of Narnia for example). <br/><br/>I was thrilled when I heard they were going to turn The Hobbit into a trilogy adding extra content from the Silmarillion, the Appendix of the Lord of the Rings and the notes on the Hobbit from Tolkien himself to improve a novel that (he would have been the first to admit) was flawed. All the flaws the novel had were straightened away by the movie and, with a proper understanding of the medium, I'm sure that eventually Tolkien would have agreed. <br/><br/>I am convinced that this is one of the best screen adaptations 'ever'. It remains loyal to the themes and lore of Tolkien, the emotional connections and it even takes into account the notes and comments by Tolkien and reckons with the rest of his oeuvre, making a brilliant connection to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. People shouldn't forget the novel was written by Tolkien more than 75 years ago (for his own children) without the intention of ever having it published and that a very literal translation of the book to the screen simply wouldn't work. Peter Jackson is one of the few who understands that adaptations should be creative rather than literal and should elevate the entire work. And I haven't even mentioned the wonderful talent at WETA yet and the way a Tolkien story lifts the creative power of Howard Shore up from all the composers in the world to an unreal, intuitive and almost spiritual level. <br/><br/>This is a great movie definitely worth seeing! I'm very much looking forward to the sequels!"

","Now I'm just as happy watching a slow burn film as an all action epic, but this felt like Peter Jackson had spent 3 hours rubbing two sticks together and failed to get a single glow. It felt laboured and turgid. If I'd submitted the script to my old English teacher she would have written ""PADDING!"" in big red letters in the margins. Friends who have watched it (and some reviewers, I note) comment that ""You need to give it a chance as the film doesn't really get started until you're about an hour in."" An hour! Any other film that took half a standard film length on introducing the characters wouldn't have stood a chance of being shot. I imagine Jackson's pitch to the studio went something like this: <br/><br/>PJ. I want to make Tolkien's The Hobbit. Studio. Is it like Lord of the Rings? PJ. Sort of, it's set in the same world and is about what happened to Bilbo Baggins before Frodo got the ring. Studio. So it's a prequel. PJ. Not exactly. Tolkien wrote it first. It's a separate story really, then he decided... Studio. Ah, we only do prequels - audiences aren't clever enough to recognise a separate-but-before story. PJ. It's a prequel. Studio. Great. How long is it? PJ. Just over 300 pages - say 1 hour 40? Studio. (Sighs)Peter, we'll make more money if it's another trilogy. PJ. It's a trilogy.<br/><br/>The LOTR trilogy successfully managed to create a fantasy world which was believable with credible characters and fantasy dialogue that worked. You simply accepted all the talk of magic, olden ways, Elven lore etc, but in The Hobbit it just comes across as corny and forced, as though someone had picked up a load of cheap fantasy novels and extracted suitable mystical stock phrases from them. The characters don't sell either, particularly the utterly ridiculous Radagast. They haven't got that same stamp of authenticity that they did in LOTR. Saruman appears to be on the verge of senility and listening to broad Scots and Irish accents of two of the dwarfs is priceless. As far as the visual style of the film is concerned, I get the artistic decision to shoot with the high frame rate cameras and creating super-saturated shots, but just because it's an artistic decision doesn't mean it's a GOOD artistic decision. Unfortunately, along with a lot of the CG, it just make the film look slightly fake and unconvincing.<br/><br/>I'm not a Tolkienite, though I do appreciate his books, but I suspect that in whatever passes for Middle-earth heaven, JRR is sitting somewhere sobbing and just repeating the word, ""Why?"" over and over again."
"xlivelaughenjoyx","9","7","13","19 January 2013"," I recommend it!
","So this is my first time writing a review on IMDb so I'm going to warn everyone that this may contain spoilers! I quite enjoyed the movie; The Hobbit, and the Lord of the Rings (hereafter LOTR) series has always been some of my favorite books. I do agree that the the time could be cut down, it doesn't really need to be three movies- it could have been just one. With the original LOTR trilogy, each movie matches up with one of the books, so it made sense for it to be three movies. The Hobbit is a shorter plot, there is no reason for it to be so long.<br/><br/>However, despite the length of the movie, I still enjoyed it. I thought that the cast of characters captured the written personalities quite well. As for the rowdy humor, it was supposed to be rowdy! For anyone who has read the actual book, the dwarfs are meant to be loud boisterous creatures. In this regard the film captured that aspect quite well. I have read through an amazing number of reviews that complain about the ""lack of foreshadowing"" the film held, but that is because the movie is a prequel to LOTR. Much of the information that shows up has been told in the sequel. The difference between more modern stories and older stories, is the modern ones lay everything out. The authors offer no challenge to the viewer/reader, and so if the information is not spelled out as if for a child, most dismiss it. Everything in the film held some sort of meaning, from the necromancer to the dragon, you only had to do some of the work yourself. If you are still confused after the movie, read the book. It probably would answer many of your questions.<br/><br/>Finally, I have also read reviews who claim that Tolkien STOLE his ideas from Rowling. This made me speechless. I still can't believe the ignorance of the people who support this claim. Don't be offended, I am going to explain why I've called these people ignorant. This is the reason, Rowling wrote Harry Potter AFTER LOTR and The Hobbit were written. His books were written before Rowljng even started to draft Harry Potter, so any similarities that you see (and there are several, I admit) Rowling would have borrowed from Tolkien. A dead man can't steal the living's ideas. He had been dead for 24 years when Harry Potter came out. If your not convinced, LOTR came out in 1954 and was written between 1937 and 1949, Rowling released Harry Potter in 1997. See? It is IMPOSSIBLE for Tolkien to have ""stolen"" Rowling's idea, she would have stolen his.<br/><br/>Besides Tolkien was named the ""father of high fantasy"" which should show that he had the original idea."
"MakoMori","6","7","13","15 January 2013"," a bit self-indulgent
","Let me start by saying The Hobbit was casted incredibly well. Martin Freeman was the perfect Bilbo, mostly due to his comedic timing with a good balance of heart as well (similar to Pipin & Merry in LOTR) that would have made the film to heavy otherwise. Gandalf played by the always fantastic Ian Mckellan is able to shine comedically as well, being the occasionally ambiguous (trickesy hobbitses!) and light hearted Gandalf the Gray we all loved from The Fellowship. New guy Richard Armitage as Thorin the dwarf, is featured heavily and has to carry the film at points. Armitage has had the hard task of making his character likable, without using humor (Bilbo does steal the show in that respect). The other 12 (is it 13) dwarfs are handled very well considering there are so many of them, you take away a few characteristics and quirks from all of them, that do add to the humor of the story as well. Andy Serkis is able to once again able to channel Gollum's comedic and tragic identity seemingly without effort. <br/><br/>The cinematography is as beautiful as it always is. If any movie wanted to make you travel to New Zealand this would be the one. As far as the frames per minute (some people feel as if they are watching a soap opera) as long as you have an HD t.v and you are used to it, the frames per minute shouldn't bother you too much. The 3D is a different story. Prepare yourself for some minor vertigo for some scenes. I am disappointed in Peter Jackson when it comes to he 3D it was completely unnecessary, and heavy handed. (If you want lessons on 3D go and see Hugo) The CGI was well done for the most part, but was heavy handed as well. <br/><br/>The Hobbit was a bit self indulgent, and probably would have been better in two parts, but overall it was a very satisfying film. From the ambitious action scenes to the comedic dialogue, The Hobbit will be sure to satisfy fans of the novel and action lovers as well."

This is my first review but I hit my limit of what I can swallow from the never ending stream of poop called blockbusters. <br/><br/>As there where undoubtedly very good scenes and enjoyable moments the overall feeling is: Why so much long execive close combat battles? Why obscure and change very inventive and creative story elements found in the book... just so they can squeeze more ""yeah hardcore kill em all"" over the top action/battle scenes? To the very point that the movie spit me out instead of sucking me in the story. Unbelievable escapes... Camera travels that made me motion-sick. ""All Hollywood"" steaming horse manure. *Ok....

"Barky44","6","7","13","31 December 2012"," Disappointing
","Going in to the Hobbit, I had certain expectations based on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>I expected the film would be beautifully shot, with fantastic art design, intricate sets, detailed costumes, and spectacular scenery. They did not disappoint. The continuity of the art department and cinematographer from those films to this one shows, and it also shows that they still care about what they are doing. I especially love what they did with the dwarven stronghold of Erebor. My only criticism in this area is the make-up on Thorin Oakenshield, especially the facial hair. He does not look like a dwarf. I know it's a starring role and the actor needs to emote through the makeup in order to ""sell"" it. You couldn't have him buried in extensive hair/bear/mustache pieces (like John Rys-Davies suffered through in LOTR). But Thorin is just not a dwarf in this film. Kili also does not look like a dwarf, but at least he plays the character in an upbeat, youthful fashion so his ""5 o'clock shadow"" scruff seems appropriate. But Thorin is a dour character, and his look -- which I call ""dwarf metrosexual"" -- just does not fit. The rest of The Company have great looks, I know they could have come up with something better for Thorin.<br/><br/>I expected this movie to have a great film score. Howard Shore's work on the trilogy was outstanding, and made those films complete. Here, well, there are few new pieces, but most of the score is derivative from prior works. I know it's important for some continuity. The hobbits, in particular, are very set in their ways, so it's highly appropriate to use the same themes for Hobbiton that Shore used in the first trilogy. But they recycled the Ringwraith theme, even though they don't appear in this film, and they used a lot of the same segue music and other cues. There are a few new songs, cues, and themes, but even there, a few fall flat. I remember one specific choral piece simply not fitting with what was happening on the screen. Choral music is used to imbue pathos into a scene, but I don't recall that scene requiring pathos. I just remember the choral music not fitting the mood.<br/><br/>I expected this movie to have a lot of action sequences. This is where Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" is actually above LOTR: it has a lot more action sequences. There's a lot here to excite: Smaug's attack on Erebor is brilliantly portrayed, the above-ground warg chases are pretty harrowing, as is the film's climax. But there's an awful lot of goofy crap in it, too. The underground battle with the goblins has some goofy chase sequences that reminded me of a version of Pitfall produced for the NES some 15 years ago. A friend turned to me and said ""obligatory video game sequence"", so it wasn't just me. The Goblin King and his odd army are brilliant, but the escape scene is just goofy. There's also this encounter with stone giants in the mountains that, although faithful to the book, is so ridiculous it pulls you out of the film. Then there's the Radagast sequence, which is complete ""WTF?"" I know ""The Hobbit"" is a kid's book. I know it's not LOTR. I actually like that they had goofy dwarfs and a generally lighter tone than ""Lord of the Rings"". But some of these action sequences are just so utterly ridiculous they ruin the whole thing.<br/><br/>Finally, I expected the story to be expanded. The writing team said as much throughout the production. I was hoping it would be a good, meaningful expansion (like the Arwen arc in the LOTR films). I was also hoping the expansion would bring depth to the other characters (JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" could not be considered a ""character piece""). I found myself not pleased with the results. I found the additional story elements (specifically the White Council/Necromancer backstory) to be irrelevant and uninteresting and not thematically appropriate to the story. ""The Hobbit"" is a lighthearted adventure, adding in this heavy plot stuff interrupts that flow. I also found the addition of Frodo and ""old"" Bilbo in the beginning of the story to be unnecessary. Sure, it was cool to do a transition between Ian Holm's Bilbo and Martin Freeman's, but it could have been simpler and to-the-point instead of the exaggeration it became. I know the filmmaker wanted to include his friends from the first production in The Hobbit, and I am a fan, they are all fine actors, but he should have focused on the story at hand instead.<br/><br/>What really bothers me about these additions is they take away time that could have been used to work on the various characters, specifically Thorin and the relationship between and amongst his fellow dwarfs. Adding a bit of interpersonal conflict between the dwarfs would have made it so much more interesting than just adding another storyline. As it is, they are (as yet) undeveloped. We know Thorin is grumpy and determined, we know his dwarfs are goofy and boisterous, we known Bilbo is a fish out of water. Beyond that, there's not much going on with them. Contrast ""Fellowship"", with it's touching character-driven scenes such as Gandalf & Frodo's talk in Moria; Aragorn & Boromir's encounter in Rivendell; the hobbit bonding experience running from the Black Riders; and all the touching stuff at the end when the Fellowship breaks. These moments don't really exist in ""The Hobbit"", and that's the biggest shame of this film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it's entertaining, it's beautiful to look at, but it's overboard on goofiness, camp, and PJ's favors to actors, and not deep enough on character. It's disappointing."
"roland-longhursten","10","15","34","11 December 2012"," Incredible movie. Yet failed 3D-48fps
","To begin with, as many others have stated, the movie is absolutely AWESOME!!! Only super-tiny negative comment I have is that the stone- giant scene felt a bit pushed and unnecessary. The viewer had no real prewarning it was going to happen(In the first LOTR there was a sense of foreboding about entering Moria for example). And it really didn't contribute anything to the story. <br/><br/>As for the 3D-48fps. I was so unfortunate as to see it at a theater in Sweden(Heron City) where they didn't show it properly. At times, and they where many, the image got really blurry. Instead of showing 2 pictures at the same time(for 3D) it was like they were showing 4-5 pictures at the same time. Which made the screen blurry. And it was not just me who noticed this. Everyone seemed to remark on this. Although when it wasn't blurry the 3D-48fps added an incredible depth to the movie. Talked to a guy who saw it in another theater and they did not have this problem. Will definitely see this again in a theater where they hopefully have a working projector >:)!"
"ll_cool_tap","7","20","48","11 December 2012"," Reflections after seeing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
","First of all, let me say I'm a great fan of all of Tolkiens works. Silmarillion is being read like the bible in my house, and yet I can't feel satisfied with this first part of The Hobbit.<br/><br/>It is much more true to the book than the previous LOTR trilogy, which is a great plus. Another thing worth mentioning is the CGI, at parts fantastic, but as well with some flaws that kind of annoyed me a little, such as some of the dark spawn and their pets. Since the original story is such a fantastic tale of the bravery found in places never even considered, it is hard to make anything else than a solid story for this adaption. But I feel there are some lack of commitment from some of the cast. Most of the actors (females are pretty much none existent) does a good job with the characters, but I can't feel with the characters as I did in the LOTR trilogy, which I was pretty critical of from the beginning due to not following the books properly (you who actually read the books knows what I mean), but those actors made you feel for them, regardless. <br/><br/>But what really made this movie just a good fantasy flick instead of a great one, is the first hour or so. If you ever watched the British soap opera ""Emmerdale"", this looks pretty much the same. The camera work felt under par for this part, though the settings are pretty nice. The other thing I would like to criticize is the many Jar-Jar Binks turning up here. He was funny for the first 5 minutes of Star Wars ep 1, but here we gets plenty of the same thing. My guess to why? For selling as much merch as possible to kids and their parents of course, there are no other explanation since a majority probably agrees with me; Jar-Jar is lame.<br/><br/>This movie is really hyped, I get that, and as a side effect this movie will and have gained a much higher rating here on IMDb than it deserved. I give it a 7 for a solid effort, but in some ways it lacks the depth that Tolkiens masterpiece provides, and that is a big shame.<br/><br/>edit: There seems to be lots of people that doesn't find this review useful. Never mind those negative voters since those most certainly are in the category of people that hails everything that Hollywood produces, no matter what. As long as the budget is gigantic and the CGI is massive, those people are satisfied. This review is not for those people. This review are for those who actually intend to use their own brains, even if it is just for a slight second."
"classicalsteve","10","12","26","9 January 2013"," If You Enjoy Revisiting Middle Earth, the Hobbit is Astonishing -- A Masterpiece of English Mythological
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of a projected three-film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's ""the Hobbit"", the first fantasy book written by Tolkien taking place in the mythical ""Middle Earth"". Many decades before the recent film, ""the Hobbit"", originally published by Allen and Unwin UK in 1937, ushered in the beginning of the quest fantasy genre of modern fantasy which has been copied many times since. And yet, Tolkien's original novel about a hobbit, a smallish humanoid living on the edges of a mythical world called ""Middle Earth"", who by chance becomes the pivotal character of a quest among dwarfs, holds up surprisingly well even after 75 years.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has once again provided a mesmerizing screen adaption of one of Tolkien's most beloved tales. The look and feel of Middle Earth is equal to and possibly even better than Jackson's adaption of ""Lord of the Rings"" ten years earlier. But even aside from the look and feel, the acting of the characters stands up well. Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, is the reluctant adventurer, a hobbit who would rather be smoking his pipe and perusing his books than outwitting trolls and goblins. Hobbits enjoy reading about adventure instead of actually engaging in adventure. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf, the wise but eccentric wizard whose presence is the very face of Middle Earth. Richard Armitage plays Thorin, the displaced heir of the King Under the Mountain whose dwarven society was shattered by the dragon Smaug. The other dwarfs which make up the band of misfits all have their lovable eccentricities as Tolkien had forged them.<br/><br/>While the story itself of a band of dwarfs seeking to reclaim their home and treasure which was plundered from them by the ominous dragon Smaug is quite well-known, some of the inspiration behind the story may be less well-known to most readers and movie-goers. Tolkien himself was raised in small medieval-like towns in the county of Worcestershire. These humble towns in the English countryside ring strikingly of Tolkien's Hobbiton. Both Bilbo Baggins and later Frodo Baggins will leave Hobbiton and become enmeshed in great epic quests and battles, somewhat similar to when Tolkein became a young man and entered into the epic conflict of World War I. These same themes on a grander scale will play out in ""the Lord of the Rings"". Also, Tolkien was a scholar of medieval and Nordic mythology, and these stories were intended as a kind replacement for the lost English mythology and lore resulting from the Norman conquest of 1066. <br/><br/>I think the main issue for movie-goers is whether or not one wants to revisit Middle Earth and hang out there for nearly three hours. If you do, then there are almost no shortcomings at all to ""the Hobbit"". A few sequences went on a bit long, particularly when the dwarfs are taken hostage by Goblins, and other long-winded sequences in which the CGI effects are used ad infinitum. At the same time, the film is true to Tolkien's original vision. Jackson's intent I believe is to immerse the viewer into Middle Earth as if the audience is part of the quest along with Bilbo and the Dwarfs. Also, the scenes with the most ghoulish character Gollum, do not drag on too long. In all an absolute triumphant of high fantasy filmmaking. But if you're taste is not in the realm of fantasy of this type, it may be too much. All I can do is offer my condolences."

","Being an avid Tolkien nut, I was almost brought to tears by the beauty of this movie. Jackson did a fantastic job again. To be honest, when the movie started, I thought to myself - something is wrong here, this feels weak. Boy was I wrong. As the movie progressed, it got more and more intense. I was bothered by a few changes that Jackson made including not having Gandalf confuse the trolls, and the addition of some scenes including the pale orc, the council at Rivendell, and the a few others that avid readers will see right away. The good news is is that the additions really weren't fabricated as they appear in the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. <br/><br/>A lot of critics are comparing this movie to LOTR erroneously. First of all, LOTR is 10 hours worth of movie encompassing 3 different (although linked) books. This is the first part of one book. Of course it feels segmented and unfinished to those who are comparing it to a completed epic. When all three films are released, it will be apparent how awesome, encompassing, and satisfying this movie will be - I promise<br/><br/>Acting, directing, visuals, and story were wonderful and I will probably see it at least two more times in theaters."
"j-j-575-310435","10","10","21","7 January 2013"," A Response to 8 Most Frequent Complaints About the Hobbit
","Since many reviews have already been written and almost everything has been said on the matter, I have decided to list the most frequent complaints brought up by the reviewers and discuss them (of course not ad personam, but in general terms).<br/><br/>Complaint 1 ""The movie is too long given the fact it's based on a 300-page book.""<br/><br/>This would be a valid point if it weren't for one thing: the movie uses far more material than you will find in the Hobbit book. Here is a list of scenes that are not covered in this particular Tolkien's work or only alluded to: a) The whole prologue b) Azog c) Radagast d) Dol Guldur e)The White Council<br/><br/>That is actually a substantial portion of the movie. Of course PJ tried to explain that, but in vain. Critics had already declared: ""it's too long and the decision was of financial nature"". Well, of course it was. But PJ had other reasons for splitting the movie into three parts and that reason was a great amount of additional material that would make the Hobbit more profound and a tad closer to the LOTR movies. Getting rid of those scenes would simplify the story even further and there would be even more complaints about the story being not as gripping as the one in LOTR.<br/><br/>Complaint 2 ""There are sequences in the movie that drag, especially at the beginning of the movie.""<br/><br/>Now this is interesting. Recently I've read old reviews of the Fellowship of the Ring from which I've learned that the pace of the movie is  too fast. And actually - I agree with it. You have this impression that characters in FOTR were not introduced properly. This time PJ had this luxury to devote more time to character exposition. But a lot of people have already gotten used to this ""music video-like pace"" of the movies where there is no time to stop and get to know the characters - which is a shame as I enjoyed the whole sequence in Bag End and felt like in the past where directors did not have to rush anywhere and could build the mood of the movie properly.<br/><br/>Complaint 3 ""The movie does not have the magnitude of LOTR trilogy""<br/><br/>Of course, it doesn't. It is based on a children's book. This complaint should be addressed to Tolkien himself, not to PJ. The Hobbit is merely an introduction to the Middle Earth: Sauron is still weak, there are no black riders or Witch-king of Angmar. Instead, the characters fight  trolls and goblins. This is our source material this time so comparing it to LOTR is pointless. <br/><br/>Complaint 4 ""The movie is childish and naive."" <br/><br/>As above. The movie is based on the book for children. Still PJ did his best to expand it and add extra material to make it more complex and interesting for adults.<br/><br/>Complaint 5 ""The movie strays away from the source material by making it darker than the book.""<br/><br/>It has to if PJ wanted to make it consistent with LOTR trilogy. But still it is closer to the book than LOTR was so I can't understand the criticism here. As an adaptation it is definitely a more faithful film than LOTR.<br/><br/>Complaint 6 ""The music repeats the same motifs from LOTR soundtrack.""<br/><br/>Yes, it does only when we see the characters known from LOTR trilogy. Another device used to make the Hobbit more consistent with previous films – which, in my opinion, is a good idea.<br/><br/>Complaint 7 ""The 48fps format makes it difficult for viewers to immerse in the world of Middle Earth.""<br/><br/>For me this issue is blown out of proportions. A lot of scenes look much better in 48fps (battle scenes or landscape scenes). There is less chaos and blur and in other scenes (Bag End) when everything looks ""too real"" it is just a question of getting used to the new look which shouldn't be that difficult given the fact that we can see a similar effect watching a movie on a high quality 200 or 400 Hz LED TV at home.<br/><br/>Complaint 8 ""The movie relies too much on CGi characters and does not look as real as LOTR.""<br/><br/>With this I can agree though I can understand that it was difficult to shoot scenes with Azog fighting dwarfs when filmmakers wanted to show the difference in height between them. Plus, more CGI gives a different feel to the movie emphasizing its different (less serious) character.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>All in all, this whole battle between enthusiastic reviews and extremely negative opinions which we are witnessing now resembles the situation when a famous music band, after releasing a seminal album, decides to produce something utterly different in style. A lot of people then are unable to embrace the change as they expected another record in the old style.<br/><br/>Same with the Hobbit. When it comes to the quality of filmmaking, it is comparable to LOTR trilogy. But since the history is simpler and the movie has a noticeably different look and style (more humor + more CGI), many people express disappointment. Clearly, the movie should gain more positive reviews once people understand it is a different story from LOTR."

","I have seen the movie four times: once in 2D and three times in 3D 48fps. More on technology issues at the end of the review. Now let me discuss the movie itself.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is absolutely fantastic. I think Peter Jackson did his best to transform a relatively simple story for younger kids into a movie which is comparable to the Lord of the Rings movies. Of course, the Hobbit plot has certain limitations that can't be overcome. It does not have and, in fact, will never have that magnitude and solemnity of the Lord of the Rings. I think, then, a lot of disappointment expressed in some reviews comes from a serious misunderstanding of what is being reviewed: the movie or the plot (which after all is quite faithful to the book). The result is that, since the plot of the Hobbit will never be as good, as complex as the one in LOTR, some people were disenchanted. But if you look at the movie itself, the Hobbit defends itself and indeed is at least as good as Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>Now some details:<br/><br/>I fundamentally disagree with the opinions that the movie is stretched and that the pace is too slow. Well, I believe the pace is just right. I hate to say that but I wish LOTR movies had this kind of pace and space for character exposition (fortunately the extended edition of LOTR solves this problem - at least to some extent). As a result, the scenes in Hobbiton are actually my favorites, being full of funny dialogs and situations. <br/><br/>I was afraid there will be a lot of cheesy humorous scenes, but actually there were few and far between (actually you can find these in LOTR as well). Still, I have to admit, there is a lot of humor in the Hobbit, which stems from the fact that The Hobbit is intended as a more light- hearted movie than LOTR - a mere introduction to the Middle Earth, still free of Sauron which will return later. This clearly surprised a lot of people who expected a similar tone to the one in LOTR (though they shouldn't if they read the book)!<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>There are many: <br/><br/>1. I loved the prologue 2. I loved Riddles in the Dark – this one really IS a killer. 3. I loved Stone Giants battle – utterly spectacular, visually it's one of the best scenes I have ever seen. 4. I loved all the scenes with Azog – for me this character is almost as scary as Black Riders although I wish PJ had not made him a CGI character 5. I loved the scene with Radagast in Dol Guldur - really creepy! 6. I loved the scenes with Warg scouts and Eagles. 7. Acting is superb (Martin Freeman and Armitage - I say it's better than in LOTR). 8. Great music.<br/><br/>As for the technology, I have seen the movie four times and I definitely prefer 48fps version. Frankly I don't understand all this fuss about this new format. It looks good, the battle and landscape scenes look less chaotic and blurry. <br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie. Surely, a couple of things could have been done better (my only complaint is the excessive reliance on CGI) but given the limitations of the plot, Peter did a great job. <br/><br/>I also believe the Hobbit will get a better reception in time once people fully realize it is a different story from LOTR.<br/><br/>zentaur"
"tomcatjak","9","10","21","27 December 2012"," What a Nostalgic Feeling Watching this Movie.
","I was a big fan of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, it felt like it had been so long since I had experienced a movie like the series.<br/><br/>While the story line is different, the general feeling of the film while watching it really brought me back to the first time I ever watched Lord of the Rings in theater. There is all you can ask for; Golem, Orcs, Goblins, Dwarfs, Elves, and even Gandolf. <br/><br/>The casting is incredible, I am so glad they stuck with as many LotR characters as possible. Peter Jackson did a great job of putting characters in their roles.<br/><br/>Upon entering the theater I did not really expect a action packed film, but was I wrong! Once the movie gets rolling it almost seems like you are part of the adventure, like you want to jump in the movie. It really does look fun albeit dangerous.<br/><br/>What really surprised me were the phenomenal graphics throughout the movie. There is no doubt this movie was carefully made with the best in the profession of CGI.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone with a good taste of action and adventure. The only reason I do not give this movie a ten is because I have to wait a year to see the second installment. Which I knew I would have to do prior to viewing it."
"digitalbeachbum","7","10","21","15 December 2012"," An Honest Hobbit Review
","I've changed my review after having watched The Hobbit all the way through on all three installments. I sat down on a Saturday afternoon and watched them together finishing later in the evening.<br/><br/>While I still enjoy the cinematography, the makeup, FX, costumes and the acting, I enjoy the direction less. I'm less enthusiastic of the added excessive fluff to the story so they could stretch it out over the three installments to make more money.<br/><br/>The Hobbit could have been made in to a single (3) hour movie. There was no reason to make a (9) hour movie. I'd love to see some one edit the (9) hours down to (3) or (4) hours, much like The Phantom Edit did for The Phantom Menace.<br/><br/>The same can be said for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy which is another (9) hours of fluff. Every thing else is awesome but the rest of it can be cut out. No need for all that crap, plus the wrong spiders in the wrong installment.<br/><br/>7/10 is my new rating for this movie and the other installments."
"MartinN82","7","14","32","18 December 2012"," Beautiful but disappointing.
","This is my first time reviewing a movie here on IMDb, and the main reason is this: Though overall a good movie, some aspects of it left me deeply unsatisfied. I just want to share a little bit of why I was disappointed. Even though it is extremely unlikely that my opinion have any influence over the two following installments, being silent completely eliminates the possibility. The review may contain minor spoilers, so read at your own risk.<br/><br/>So, let's start with the good things about this movie: It is extremely well done technically and artistically. The landscapes, props, costumes and camera work is absolutely fantastic. The movie delivers absolutely stunning environments, way more realistic and detailed than LOTR. The music is good and the overall feeling is great. The acting was good in my opinion, and the dwarfs were humorous, yet not to the extent of becoming silly. This was one of the big reliefs for me, as I expected all dwarfs except Thorin to be clowns - After all, we all saw what Peter Jackson did to Gimli in LOTR. If it weren't for the criticism I am going to post below, I would give this movie a 9/10.<br/><br/>And here are the things that I disliked: The movie started good, but during the second half, things turned ugly. - The situations sometimes become totally absurd. The characters falls down great heights, get trapped on a rock giants leg and gets stuck in a ""rain of boulders"". And no one gets hurt. It seems like all of this is only created to maximize the use of special effects. It adds nothing to the story. The result, for me, was a total lack of tension, as I got the impression that the characters were immortal anyway, so why worry? The amount of impossible action sequences was just too large for this movie to be taken seriously. And then, in the middle of all this, the cheesiest comic relief I have ever seen is delivered. Embarrassing. Also I have a great problem with the way small things in scenes are changed, only making the movie worse than the book. The LOTR was also filled with these changes, which ruined parts of the last two movies for me, as I had the bad judgment of reading the books first. I also think that the movie was too long. If some of the pointless action scenes were removed, it would have been a much better movie overall.<br/><br/>Hopefully the upcoming two movies will be better. An Unexpected Journey had the potential of becoming a fantastic movie. In my opinion it failed. So please, regarding the following movies, lets not ruin them with idiotic action sequences like ""legolas skating down a stair on a shield while shooting his bow"" in The Two Towers, or ""Trolls delivering cheesy one-liners before dying"" in The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>And yes, I have read the books, several times.<br/><br/>7/10"
"jasonpachar","10","6","11","26 June 2014"," Return to Middle Earth
","It's been 9 years since we left Middle Earth, but we never knew that we would ever return to the land of enchantment – the land of dwarfs, elves, wizards and even the littlest of people – hobbits. As the intro to the movie shows us, it shows us what will be and then tells the story of a young, but naïve hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He never knew of an adventure until a certain wizard showed up at his doorstep.<br/><br/>But as the movie goes on, we are re-introduced to familiar faces – Elrond, Galadriel, Saurman, and the ultimate villain of the entire series – the ""precious"", the conviving Gollum. All he wants is to live with the one thing that anyone could ever ask for – a long life of misery.<br/><br/>It does not surprise me that Peter Jackson has revisited Middle Earth. It is a place of magic, a place of enchantment. We are just so intertwined into what was originally written by Tolkien and the magic of Jackson – it just makes you want to visit as often as you want.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the biggest movie of 2012 and what a way to end 2012. I can't wait to see what the next 2 installments will bring."
"vampiremeg","6","6","11","9 March 2013"," A bore
","I gave 6 because of the riddle scene. The rest is a bore. I almost fell in sleep in a 3D IMAX cinema...Also, 3D itself seems unnecessary. Nothing really that stunning happened in it. The visual effects look quite mediocre.<br/><br/>The story is more of an introduction of how things begin, which is a good idea, I have to say. But if you rethink about what you've seen in the movie, you might feel that you don't quite need this introduction...The spin-off doesn't seem to enrich the Lord of the Rings series. It doesn't add anything new or better.<br/><br/>All we could see is a very handsome but stubborn princess leading a bunch of good and tough dwarfs, who by the way, every time could stand out when he faces his old foe Pale Orcs. I felt somewhat amused when I saw him ""erect"" at the sight of the monster...Jesus, again with the lone wolf hero? Isn't that happening in every Hollywood movie? Can't it be something different? And Cate Blanchette is truly a guest in the movie. I don't know how much she could get paid by playing this role in this very movie, but I would call it quite a big amount of easy cash."
"frantroya","6","6","11","27 January 2013"," Disappointing
","As a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings saga and reader of all the books I must say I was very disappointed with this new film. Lacks all the good stuff that made the book one of my favourites back when i was a teenager and hinders all Peter Jackson's good work in the previous films. It looks to me more as a film for Twilight fans than anything else: plain, childish and overall predictable in gags and action. Shame. I'm pretty sure Tolkien would have not enjoyed the adaptation this time. Let's see what happens with the next two films though my expectations are already quite low and I still don't understand the need of exploiting one book into a new trilogy. Marketing versus quality?"
"JamesHitchcock","7","6","11","24 January 2013"," Inappropriately Grandiose
","Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a mighty epic fantasy, well over a thousand pages in length in most editions. Although Tolkien intended it to be a single novel, his publishers, for commercial reasons, issued it as a trilogy. (It is still often published in this form). When Peter Jackson adapted the work for the cinema, therefore, it made both commercial and artistic sense for him to make three separate films, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"", each based on one of the elements of the trilogy. <br/><br/>Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", by contrast, is a relatively short book, in my edition only some two hundred pages long, much shorter than any of the three elements of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It was originally intended for children (although it is the sort of children's book that can easily be enjoyed by adults) and is much less complex in terms of its plot and in terms of its themes than ""The Lord of the Rings"". It could easily have been made into a single film of around the standard two hours duration. I was therefore dubious when I heard that Jackson intended to turn the book into another trilogy, rivalling ""The Lord of the Rings"" in length. <br/><br/>Tolkien's story tells of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and of his companions, a group of thirteen dwarfs and the wizard Gandalf, as they set out to rescue a hoard of stolen gold from a fierce dragon. It also tells of their various adventures at the hands of the other inhabitants of Tolkien's imagined realm of Middle Earth- trolls, goblins, elves and animals. The book can be read as an introduction to ""The Lord of the Rings"", which is supposed to take place some sixty years later, because it introduces characters such as Gollum and Gandalf, who will play an important role in the later work, and because it tells of the earlier history of the Ring, which it will later fall to Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is the first part of Jackson's second trilogy. Although it is nearly three hours in length, it only covers the first few chapters of Tolkien's book, which means that the original story has had to be padded out a lot. This is done by showing in great detail matters which are only briefly described in the book (such as how the dragon Smaug obtained the gold from the dwarfs in the first place) and even by introducing events which do not occur, and characters which do not appear, in the book at all. Some characters from ""Lord of the Rings"", such as Galadriel and the wizards Saruman the White and Radagast the Brown appear in the film, although they do not actually appear in Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"". (Radagast, who only plays a minor role in the later book, was omitted from the film version). <br/><br/>I have given this film a relatively high mark, because it has many virtues, most of them shared with the first trilogy. Visually the film is very attractive, with a brilliantly imagined world of Middle Earth, set against some striking photography of the New Zealand landscapes. The various malevolent beings of Tolkien's mythology, the trolls, goblins and wargs (huge, ferocious wolf-like creatures) are all successfully realised; the vulgar and stupid trolls largely serve as the film's main comic relief. The very talented composer Howard Shore again provides the musical score, as he did for the first trilogy. Several of the actors from the earlier films, notably Ian McKellen as the wise, kindly Gandalf and Andy Serkis as the wretched Gollum, successfully reprise their roles, and there are good performances from newcomers Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm returns as the older Bilbo) and Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the determined and headstrong leader of the dwarfs. The other dwarfs, on the other hand, apart from the fat, lazy Bombur, do not really come across as sharply-defined individuals, but this was also a weakness in Tolkien's book. <br/><br/>I will reserve my final judgement on the wisdom of turning ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy when I have seen the other two instalments, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" and ""There and Back Again"", but ""An Unexpected Journey"" has confirmed my initial suspicion that this lighter, shorter book was not really a suitable candidate for the full heroic fantasy treatment given to ""The Lord of the Rings"". Too often Jackson and his scriptwriters seemed to be guilty of padding out a very slight text in order to produce something inappropriately grandiose, and I found myself wishing that he could have found an alternative format for filming ""The Hobbit"". 7/10"
"carltoncardozo","5","6","11","15 January 2013"," Disappointed..Not half as good as any from the LOTR trilogy
","First,I'm a huge LOTR fan but did not enjoy the Hobbit as much as any of the LOTR movies. Mainly, because unlike LOTR, which had 3 books which turned into a trilogy, here we have one book which is being turned into a trilogy, so the pace is really slow cos there isn't as much to tell.Besides this, some of the comic dialogue did not quite hit the mark - I enjoy corny nutty humour but these were amateurish dialogues, and here are 3 specific instances - like the joke Gandalf cracks about the time golf was invented, the time Gollum was talking to himself and Bilbo says I didn't say anything and when Theorin hugs Bilbo and says hes never been wronger in his life, the impact just wasn't there. Ian McKellens face looks puffed up and he does not look younger here, hes supposed to be 60 years younger, he looks like he was drinking excessively for a couple months and his face got puffed up cos of it. The visual impact was not as breathtaking. This movie could easily have been 2 hours 15 minutes, and been just as impactful, the extra half an hour was unnecessary, and a few parts were just downright draggggggggged - like the opening meet of the dwarfs at Bilbos house - over half an hour, could have been done in 20, and the sequence of Bilo with Gollum - just to state a couple instances.<br/><br/>Its pretty obvious the objective is to make 3 parts, and not just deliver the story - this should be a 2 part movie, not 3 or sure.<br/><br/>I've seen each of the LOTR extended versions 8 times each, and I've not got bored or felt anything dragging, cos there is that much story - here there isn't. 150 pages have been dragged over 170 minutes. I'll watch the LOTR trilogy a 9th time for sure, but I'd give this a pass.<br/><br/>Nothing hit me, no WOW feeling when the movie ended. Good effects - not as good as LOTR I must say - but good, but no impact - no variation is locales, too much of shooting and dialogue in one scene/shot before moving to the next. LOTR had a much better pace, or at least interchange of pace.<br/><br/>Well, sorry :-)<br/><br/>PS: Why on earth do some who write reviews write to impress the world with their vocabulary? Let it come from the heart. Some reviews here you read, they read like the writer is begging for attention to himself/ herself - they've sat back, made an essay, well scripted and edited it, god have mercy on these people, do they get no love? lol.."
"paulwaidelich","5","6","11","15 January 2013"," Weak and Disappointing
","Peter Jackson directing another Middle Earth movie? I was pumped. My disappointment started almost immediately, and never recovered.<br/><br/>The story moves much more slowly that the 3 previous Middle Earth movies. It takes over 40 minutes just to assemble the characters and move them out of the Shire. Has my racial prejudice against dwarfs been exposed? I just couldn't care about them as much as I did the Fellowhip. Gandolf is still Gandolf, and Ian McKlellen is very fun to watch. Strider/Aragorn is replaced by a sulking dwarf king. I did not really care if he got his kingdom back or not. Frodo and Sam are replaced by Bilbo, who is harder to care about than the younger Hobbits. Even the villains are weaker; the White Orc and his wolf/lions can't compare to Sauron, the Nine and the Nazgul. Only the character of Gollum improves, as a much more three dimensional character.<br/><br/>The quest is weaker, the characters are hard to care about, the story moves slower and even the battle scenes drag on and on. I watched it twice, just to make sure. To make more sure, I watched the original 3 Fellowship movies again. The Hobbit comes up short. (Pardon the pun.) It's half the movie of the original(s), so I give it a 5."
"peter-574-935657","4","6","11","6 January 2013"," A failure of epic proportions
","First and foremost a movie should entertain. This one did not, it was boring beyond imagination. Making a 300 page book into 3 over-length movies without adding any new material simply can not work.<br/><br/>It clearly was a commercial decision to maximise overall profits, but even that will now work, a large part of the audience will not be back for the second and third instalments. Certainly that much was clear from the way people were talking about it on the way out of the theatre.<br/><br/>There were no surprises, no character development, no meaningful advancement on any level. There was no romance, no fun. Everything was utterly predictable and drawn out to oversize. <br/><br/>The Hobbit always was the poor cousin of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It should be read beforehand, as an introduction, to set the scene, to introduce the various races and their traits. It should not be viewed on the big screen, not before, not after, not ever. <br/><br/>Well, perhaps not ever in this format. There is a reason I still gave some stars. The cinematography is as epic as in LOTR, the CGI is equally good. Perhaps we can have a director's cut that condenses all 3 instalments into on single 90 minute event, I would be willing to watch it once it hits TV."
"i-am-apple","10","11","24","11 January 2013"," Exquisite Attention to Detail
","My conclusion upon watching this film and talking to others about it, is that if you are a fan of the Tolkien Universe, and not just the individual stories, then you will be a fan of this movie. That is because of the remarkably skillful inclusion of countless minor details and subtexts that Jackson has drawn from the Tolkien canon. The great thing about the Hobbit, both as a book and now as a movie, was that the lighter subject material allowed a greater exploration of the world of Middle Earth, so much of which is never actually written about in the Lord of the Rings. Places such as Mirkwood, Dale, the Kingdom of Angmar... before this movie they are just names on a map. But now Jackson has brought them to life.<br/><br/>I was really worried prior to seeing this film, that it wouldn't live up to its predecessors and would veer into childish cliché. But this movie is such a magnificent rendition of Tolkien's world that I was left breathless after the first viewing, and have watched it with satisfaction about ten times since. Everything is spectacular - the acting, the costumes, the scenery. The dialogue is witty and I still laugh at the troll scene after watching it a dozen or so times. Jackson tackles the difficult task of characterising thirteen dwarfs with mastery, and you will find yourself growing attached to them and all their individual quirks (from the eye candy of Kili and Fili to the warrior Dwalin and the comic relief of Bofur and Ori). Special mention to Richard Armitage, who absolutely blew me away with his portrayal of Thorin Oakenshield, truly bringing that character to life and adding so much depth to him that wasn't included in the book. Ian McKellan is spectacular as Gandalf, as always, and Martin Freeman is just perfect as Bilbo. I could not be happier with this movie! As a Tolkien fanatic, it satisfied everything I dreamt of seeing in a movie rendition of the Hobbit. I can't wait for the next movies now, and pray that the same level of quality is maintained."
"illbebackreviews","8","11","24","27 December 2012"," ""I will be dead before I see the Hobbit in the hands of a critic. Never trust a critic""
","Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings films and novels. In fact, they are my favorite films of all time and I watched the trilogy at least 5 times since last year! I've also read the Hobbit novel and the first two novels from J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit has been my most anticipated film of 2012 and was actually expecting a huge disappointment but after 3 1/2 hours (including ads and travel time) I was shocked to say that this is my favorite film of 2012.<br/><br/>Not only was this the best film of 2012 to me, it was also a royal welcome back into Middle Earth. There were so many good things about this film that I simply ignored all criticism that this film has been getting from so called ""critics"" <br/><br/>***CASTING***<br/><br/>The casting for this film couldn't have been better. Not only do we have the great Sir Ian McKellen returning as Gandalf, we are given a newer Bilbo played by Martin Freeman, who pretty much masters this role. Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield was absolutely spectacular. Either he or Martin Freeman deserve to be nominated for an Oscar. The two both show their emotional sides extremely well. In fact, none of the new cast are weak. All are top noch. I loved Ken Scott as Balin, my favorite dwarf. <br/><br/>The returning cast of Elijiah Wood, Hugo Weaving, Kate Blanchett, Andy Serkis and Sir Christopher Lee have not lost any touch and make the film all the more better. I mean, Sir Lee is still going strong at the age of 90. <br/><br/>***CHARACTERS***<br/><br/>Ever since I read the Hobbit book, there were some characters I absolutely loved. Thorin, Balin, Bombur, Gandalf, Gollum and Bilbo were just a few. I am thankful to say that all are superbly converted on the big screen. I was especially worried about Thorin and Bilbo leading up to this film, but all concerns have passed. Gollum is once again the stand out of the film. The only disappointment is, apart from Thorin, there really isn't much character development for any other dwarf. This was the same in the novel and PJ seemed to not have enough lore for any other character. Balin himself stands out as the second finest of the dwarfs. I also loved all returning characters.<br/><br/>***DIRECTION AND WRITING***<br/><br/>The directing by Peter Jackson is fantastic. Seeing as the Hobbit is a 300 page novel, stretching it out to three films means around 100 pages per film. That was my biggest concern for the film. I expected it to be dreadfuly slow, like critics have said, but to be perfectly honest, this was one of the fastest 3 hours of my life. The script for the film is extremely intelligently written and has lots of surprisingly great humor. I actually found myself laughing on many, many occasions. To me, the pacing of the film was brilliant. The Shire was 45 minutes long but to me, this was the fastest 45 minutes of the film. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job with the action scenes, but it isn't as great as Lord of the Rings. The fight scene at the end of the film at Goblin City was a little too much CGI and a little fake, but Riddles in the Dark keeps you interested in the film. <br/><br/>***SCORE****<br/><br/>Howard Shore does a spot on job with the score. There were some familiar soundtracks such as the Shire, the Nazgul theme and so on. The only concern, as said by critic Jeremy Jahns, is the scene at the end where Thorin stands up to Azog the Dephiler and the Nazgul theme plays. It was disappointing to hear this but the scene and movie itself was badass.<br/><br/>I did not see the movie in 3D or 48fps, but I will go back to watching the 3D 48fps and will report later. <br/><br/>Apart from Thorin, Bilbo, Gandalf, Gollum and Balin, the best thing in the film was........AZOG! I absolutely love this guy. Remember Lurtz, remember Ugluk, remember Gothmog???? Yeah, they were all pretty cool but Azog is just the biggest badass! He added such intense to the movie. In fact, the Hobbit without Azog would've been dreadful. Glad that he did not die in this film as he is the most menacing thing I've ever seen.<br/><br/>****FULL SPOILER***<br/><br/>Riddles in the Dark: Absolutely fantastic. Gollum looked far more realistic here than in Lord of the Rings. The riddles were fantastic and entertaining. It was my favorite part of the film and the book and Peter Jackson did J.R.R Tolkien and his fans justice! I was on the edge of my seat here and often laughing! When we see Gollum lose his precious, that was really intense but as we come back to the scene and find Gollum tearing up, I myself did. Gollum is portrayed as a kind, evil, friendly and psychotic character. <br/><br/>Flashback to Battle of Moria: The scene where Balin recounts the events of Thror after losing Erebor was superb. It was epic and extremely emotional. Azog,when he uses his mace to knock out dwarfs, was just epic. It was a threat and I was freaked out. The paleness was brilliant. He was the bad guy we sorta missed out in Lord of the Rings. In that scene, we can understand Thorin as a character.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hobbit was my greatest cinema experience and is actually one of my favorite all time experiences.<br/><br/>Must see for Lord of the Rings fan. Don't listen to critics and ignore Rotten Tomatoes and Meta Critic."
"s_campanale","6","11","24","17 December 2012"," The Starter is finally served...but we're all waiting for the Main Course & Dessert!
","The obvious has already been stated by almost everyone – The book is simply too slim to support a 9 hour movie trilogy and what's more it isn't serious or even ""epic"" enough to sustain such a treatment. Then there is the fact that unlike the original LOTR series where each movie corresponded to a particular book, here they have arbitrarily chopped one book up into 3 segments , so each episode is an artificial creation, not the realisation of a particular volume from literature. Plus of course, many more people have read ""The Hobbit"" and are thus familiar with it, and since most know it from childhood, they become particularly attached to it, and consequently become less forgiving of messing around with the story and characters.<br/><br/>""An Unexpected Journey"" arrives with the same hype that ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" did 11 years ago, and like ""FOTR"" (and even ""The Phantom Menace"" 3 years earlier) it has to carry the massive weight of expectations plus a year+ long media and marketing blitz preceding it despite being probably the least consequential of the trilogy and the least interesting or spectacular. Of course how we feel about ""AUJ"" will change after 2014 when the cycle is complete and we see it for what it is, Episode 1 of 3, but for now there is the inevitable sensation upon leaving it that ""nothing really happened in that one"", with all the good bits yet to come. Also LOTR was the first movie that introduced the idea of the yearly episode, a new phenomenon then in event movies that has been mutated, like 3D, into what is perceived by most filmgoers as a cynical cash-grab used by greedy studios who inflate novels into vast drawn out soufflés to get more ticket revenues and DVD sales, so audiences are less starry-eyed this time around. It's rather like looking forward to a really grand dinner, and getting a decent starter only to be told you will get the main course next year, and the desert a year after that, then another year for the coffee( if you want the ""full version"" DVD/Blu-Ray)<br/><br/>What of the film itself? Well the actors are all good, and anyone from England will recognise a lot of familiar character actors under the heavy make-up (not least Martin Freeman who no-one ever thought they would see headlining a major blockbuster). Certain parts of the film tie in fairly well with the book, especially the opening party/gathering, the scene with the 3 hungry trolls and of course Bilbo's game of riddles with Gollum (all well known and loved scenes from the book) Faring less well are the Goblins, who are largely brushed aside, though the Goblin King was well done, both in animation and in character, with the great Barry Humphries no less giving him a droll and witty edge. The scene in Rivendell is beefed up as much as similar scenes were in the LOTR adaptations, with a tie in to that trilogy in the form of Galadriel and Sauruman and foreshadowing of the growing Sauron menace. Actually it was interesting to see so many actors from the original series returning here (including older Bilbo and Frodo in a pre-FOTR moment) most of them digitally face-lifted to hide the fact they are all much older now, not alas with very convincing results.<br/><br/>The lack of a ""big-bad"", with Smaug not even seen yet and ""the Dark One"" just a rumour, leads to one major mistake, the creation of an angry Orc king with a personal vendetta against Thorin (He killed Thorin's father and Thorin chopped his arm off), who of course is not in the novel and whose inclusion feels clumsy and cheap, especially since the whole thing is such a cliché and can't avoid coming across as one. He and the Orcs push aside the Goblins and reduce the scene where they hide up trees from the wolves into an overblown symphony of stupidity (even more so when Bilbo suddenly turns into Rambo!) He's still around for the next 2 so that bodes ill.<br/><br/>The CGI has come leaps and bounds from the ground-breaking work of the originals, with an even more realistic Gollum, and Orcs that are no longer actors in masks but CGI creations which look suitably other worldly and alien (they even have their own language at last!) The trolls are great, as is the Goblin King, and the massive ""Rock Men"". The ""HFR"" format didn't seem to make too much difference, but its effects are probably subliminal, and the 3D was good but not as used as I would have imagined. The fight scenes are jumbled and confused with lots of swirling around and blurry movement that is impossible to follow, something from the original saga that alas has not been improved.<br/><br/>So ""AUJ"" is a promising start to a new trilogy, but it's just a starter, so don't expect a full course meal because you won't get it. If you loved the book, be prepared for a lot of changes and liberties, because the aim is 2 years down the line to have a 6 movie saga seamlessly blended as a whole.<br/><br/>How good will the Main Course be? Guess we'll have to wait until next Christmas to find out!"
"barcefan94","9","11","24","13 December 2012"," Very different and very very good!
","I had huge expectations before watching this movie and I was certainly not disappointed! <br/><br/>The only thing was that I went in expecting the movie to be somewhat similar to LOTR which it definitely is not and honestly I was a bit disappointed at first because of this. Luckily this changed quickly when I realized that the movie was never meant to be the same as the trilogy. This movie is a lot more humorous and offers much more comic relief than the trilogy. <br/><br/>Many critics mentioned that the beginning of the movie was too long. I have no idea why! I loved the beginning! The first meeting between Bilbo and Gandalf was perfect and I loved it. The only thing, in the beginning, that seemed slightly unnecessary was the whole ""dance of the dishes"" with the dwarfs, which I didn't actually like very much. <br/><br/>I love Martin Freeman as Bilbo! He was perfect for the part and the character itself was very good. Some has called him one-dimensional but I don't see why. The character has real depth and develops throughout the story. <br/><br/>Probably my favorite moment in the movie was the meeting between Bilbo and Gollum/Smeagol. It was fantastic to see Smeagol again and they really overdid themselves with him this time. He is ridiculously charming and funny and you feel so bad for him when he loses The One Ring. Another great part of the movie is when our heroes are in Rivendell. It was so nostalgic to see Lord Elrond, Saruman, and especially Galadriel again. <br/><br/>The 3D worked very well throughout the film and the scenery was amazing to say the least - truly magnificent. <br/><br/>I was a bit afraid that the movie would seem drawn-out since it is a relatively small book and this is only the first of three. Luckily, my fears were unnecessary. I found the movie to be over very fast and I was not bored for a second.<br/><br/>So all in all a terrific movie. The only reason I'm not giving it 10 is that there were some scenes that seemed unnecessary and some of the humor became a bit repetitive towards the end (the fat dwarf for instance)."
"FilmFanatic03","9","11","24","13 December 2012"," A potential for an amazing trilogy
","Finally Peter Jackson graces us with the prequel to the best film trilogy (The Lord of the Rings) with ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"". Obviously people are going to draw comparisons to the two, however, we have yet to see the completion of The Hobbit Trilogy so it's hard to make a strong comparison just yet. But we can see that there is a different tone for The Hobbit, a lighter tone with humour sprinkled on the film which is done in a tasteful way. <br/><br/>First of all, praise has to go out to Martin Freeman for an amazing portrayal of Bilbo Baggins. He looks the part and plays a certain naivety and innocence and we get to see his character development throughout the film, and there is enough room for his character to develop throughout the trilogy. As a LOTR fan it was a treat to see Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman and Frodo within this new Middle Earth adventure. <br/><br/>The Hobbit is full of great adventure and epic scenes. Favourite scene is the riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum, it was so simple and engaging, to see two contrasting characters interact the way they do. The dwarfs are a great bunch, and praise for how their songs were included within the film. <br/><br/>Initial comparisons of the two (LOTR and Hobbit) are that The Hobbit has a lighter tone, which is enjoyable. Yet I loved the more serious and epic tone to LOTR. The Hobbit has room to progress as we see stronger character developments and the adventure is assumed to get more dramatic and epic. This is not a criticism, as the first film is an introduction of what is to come, and what a great job Mr. Jackson has done. I just know that there are more exciting things to come, given from what I have seen from this amazing kick off to a new and potentially epic trilogy."
"joasyr-98","10","11","24","12 December 2012"," Similar, yet so Different!
","As the end credits rolled over the screen I was left a wrack. The last few minutes of this film take you on an emotional roller coaster I can promise you that! And the greatest thing about it, is how much fantastic stuff it promises for the next ones.<br/><br/>First off let's talk about the cast. Martin Freeman kills it as the ever growing (not in height of course) Bilbo, who gives both us and the Dwarfs surprise after surprise along the way. He is US in this, and we see it through his eyes. Playing his character just as perfectly is Richard Armitage, who brings a sorrow and heroism I think no one quite expected to Thorin. And of course there is Ian Mckellen and Andy Serkis, who are Awesome in every sense of the word. Just such a great ensemble, and I'm pleased to see that every dwarf is different, yet all feel like they belong in the dwarven culture. Thank you PJ and Weta!<br/><br/>There were a few things that I weren't quite sure that worked, but as they will feature much more in the next ones I will reserve judgment until then. For instance Radagast was odd (by no means a Jar Jar, but odd), however I'm not sure if he is odd-good or odd-bad before I see more of him. The second thing is some of the slapstick humor, which isn't over-done, but you notice it. The lighter tone of this first one, though, is something I think people will relish when all six movies are on our shelves, because I'm absolutely sure that the next two will get progressively darker, and therefore we'll appreciate both the slower character-driven start, as well as the lighter tone.<br/><br/>My worry now with going into Oscar season is that the critics have destroyed its chances, rather unfairly, for any of the biggest categories. I'm sure it will get enough praise for visuals and CGI, makeup etc. though, and it is well deserved.<br/><br/>Overall the movie follows somewhat the same blueprint of FOTR, but it still feels very different. The Hobbit and LOTR will be two different trilogies, woven skillfully into one. Fantastic. Just what I wanted."
"stijntje44","10","11","24","11 December 2012"," Silly yet serious, just as it should be.
","This movie is sillier than it's older brother, something you could predict from the pictures of the shaved and silly looking dwarfs.<br/><br/>It doesn't bother me that the younger dwarfs are more shaven. And the sillier looks don't bother me either, it was the perfect bland of serious and silly for a movie about a children's book that will one day become an epic saga. <br/><br/>This is made for a younger crowd. It is still great for an older crowd, but it is perfect to get the kids/teens who are just discovering all the awesomeness there is to see in this world. <br/><br/>This gets them interested with the sillier bits, and it gets them hooked with the more serious bits. Then, when they are older, they can fully enjoy Lotr. <br/><br/>Lotr was a serious movie with a shimmer of silliness shining through at times. This is exactly the opposite, and that is how it should be."
"dramaticfringe","4","18","44","13 December 2012"," Fantastic visuals, shame about the story...
","Wow, just got back from seeing it and I can't believe how boring it was! <br/><br/>I was SO ready to be amazed but I honestly felt myself nodding off a few times. Production-wise, everything was amazing. The visuals are stunningly beautiful and some of the CGI work is fantastically realised. The plot however... is really bad. Is The Hobbit a well-received book? Because the storyline was absolutely awful in this film! A bunch of guys go on a journey and face run-of-the-mill obstacles. That's pretty much it. Maybe it's because I have zero interest in this kind of fantasy (Although I like the LOTR trilogy) but seriously, how do people find this story interesting? Every situation they were in there was a sudden way out, every time someone was in danger there was a character at the ready to save them, every time someone was trapped they suddenly found something to help them escape. This is my problem with fantasy, the writers can always just think up ANYTHING to get ANYONE out of ANY situation. I mean, not once did I ever doubt that anything bad would happen to these characters.<br/><br/>The only part of the film I will praise is the segment with Gollum. My eyes were glued to the screen for that part. But everything else bored me. There were dwarfs/dwarfs with only 1 line in the entire film and the change in Bilbo Baggins happens so quickly it's hard to know if he's the same person at the end of the film. I saw no gradual change in him, just a sudden need for a character to be saved at the end and for Baggins to be that very saviour. Oh and since when does Middle Earth have chips??? Oh, I could go on and on but I'm probably in the 1% that doesn't like it. <br/><br/>I'm giving it 4 stars for the effort put into the visuals, nd for that scene with Gollum. This is just my opinion and review of the film, feel free to disagree."
"zadkine","1","21","53","15 December 2012"," Hair Club for Men with Clubs
","Two things are remarkable about this film. First, and not terribly damaging, are the hairstyles. Vidal Sassoon on acid. It will probably take a PH.D. thesis akin to ""The light imagery in Faulkner's 'As I Lay Dying'"" to explain the deeper meaning of hair in Jackson's films; I suspect it's more than just a homage to ""Hairspray"", something more profound is going on. The second remarkable thing, and it is damaging, is the violence. It all starts quietly in the Shire, and then takes off, a la ""The Wanderers"", only more bloody. If you remember ""The Wanderers"", it's about gangs delivering nonstop mayhem as they run through the streets of New York in the sixties. Same thing here, only with gangs of orcs, and much more bloodshed. It's perverse that Jackson has taken ownership of such truly wonderful stories and then tells them so badly. The dialog is ridiculous and really doesn't matter, only the fighting matters: It's all just running, fighting, huddling in dark places, more running, more fighting, more huddling in dark places, hair combed, uncombed, and combed again. All unbecombing of such a great series of books."

","People will always compare it with the LOTR trilogy, consciously or otherwise. And that is the biggest challenge facing the Hobbit trilogy. After watching it my first comment was, it should have been made before the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>As a film on its own, it is overall a very impressive effort. I read many reviews which criticised the inflation of certain scenes to make up the 3 hours and I entirely agree. I also agree that certain characters did not need to be in the film. But when I saw the Warner Brothers and MGM logos at the start of the film, I did wonder what level of control Peter Jackson had over the script content...<br/><br/>The Hobbit should not be a trilogy and the films do not need to be 3 hours duration each. There is no need to force the story to match the LOTR trilogy. I dread to think what extra material is going to be included in the Director's cut..."
"drystyx","7","9","19","22 December 2012"," Jackson aims too hard to please
","As of 2012 and 2013, the initial reaction is to compare the fantasy journey among noble dwarfs and elves, and ignoble orcs and trolls, to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which technically occurs after this adventure.<br/><br/>Director Jackson did a supreme job on the trilogy, but no matter what you do, you can't please everyone, and he too unprovoked heat from both sides of the fence. Some purists insist on using everything from the book, including Bombadil and his overly blond Hitler idealism. While the dorks wanted less character and the sort of goofy arcade room look in special effects that make the crack heads happy.<br/><br/>Jackson goes out to appease the dorks in this one. Not a bad move, but certainly lacking in originality. Here, we get a bit more ""formula"" than what we would want.<br/><br/>The abuse of effects enhance the comic nature of this story. The three trolls act so much like the Three Stooges that it is obvious Jackson was alluding to them. One of Jackson's signature stamps is the way he alludes to classics, high brow and low brow.<br/><br/>The fellowship of nine from the trilogy includes Gandalf, Frodo, and seven others. This one includes Gandalf, Bilbo, and 13 others.<br/><br/>With 12 serving under the one, it's not as easy to keep tabs on the characters.<br/><br/>Since ""The Hobbit"" is done in trilogy format, Jackson appears to be comfortable to gradually let us learn about the 12 minor dwarfs. Here, 3 of them take center stage a lot, and 2 others a bit less. The other 7 are very anonymous.<br/><br/>Most of us won't hold that against Jackson, so long as he does more character development in the next film.<br/><br/>However, it's one thing to sacrifice the rapport for action, but quite another to sacrifice it for mindless drivel.<br/><br/>However, as it is part of a trilogy, one looks at this as a third of a film, or a third of a story. It is often the comedy that brings out the pathos of tragedy. Wen we live and laugh with a group of characters, we are filled with even more sadness when some die.<br/><br/>The accents are very thick, good for purists, but not for viewers. We rarely know what is being said, so while the big screen is great for the spectacle, it will be better with the closed captioning on a small TV screen.<br/><br/>Not all of the detriments are Jackson's fault. Remember that Tolkien wrote the Middle Earth saga with some inconsistencies. The orcs look bigger, more like the Uruk Hai, but perhaps that is because they are compared to dwarfs and hobbits. The contrasts in size don't appear to be correct at times. And the orcs look much more muscular than Tolkien intended.<br/><br/>Now, that was the problem with the film. Not much of a problem, is it? More like a nit pick.<br/><br/>My rating shows that it is indeed a nit pick. First of all, the film lasts well over two hours, but you come away from it thinking you spent less than an hour watching. That's the sign of a top director. It flows and moves effortlessly.<br/><br/>Next, Bilbo himself is a great character here. He is a throwback to old style films, of the golden age, the forties, fifties, and sixties.<br/><br/>Like the ring trilogy, the hobbit begins with the status quo, which changes. That's what makes this sort of story so magical. You begin in a shire, and wind up facing trolls, goblins, and dragons.<br/><br/>Jackson makes the climactic point of the saga, the point which fits into his entire Middle Earth legend, a point to remember. It is, of course, the point of Bilbo's mercy towards Gollum, which is done quite dramatically. This is the part of the film that is the classic moment, and Jackson knows this.<br/><br/>Not that there aren't other great moments. There are. When we do get to characters, Jackson shows us what a great director he is.<br/><br/>One of the great questions to be answered, since we know the Necromancer is Sauron, is whether Saruman is already duped by Sauron. It looks pretty evident that Saruman is already against the forces of good.<br/><br/>This takes us to the ""breath of fresh air"", the character that makes this film quite unique, and gives Jackson a stamp of originality. There has to be at least one ""cool"" character in a saga of this magnitude.<br/><br/>Enter RADAGAST THE BROWN, another wizard, like Gandalf. With him, Jackson has literary license, as Radagast is merely a name in the book, a name for a good wizard, but still mostly a name.<br/><br/>Radagast becomes the cool cat of this story. His presence is not of our era, but one for the past and for the future. As Gandalf puts it, one with a great heart, and of great power, although he scarcely looks the mighty wizard.<br/><br/>Radagast, Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarfs give us a great group of characters.<br/><br/>This looks like it shapes up to be part of a great trilogy, but is lacking on its own. It still needs the next two parts to justify it. I would rather the film stand on its own as a film, but it doesn't. It leaves you hanging, much like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did. Many people like ""Empire"" films the best. To me, they are the least. In either case, they are necessary if you want to watch the entire trilogy."

It doesn't deal with the world of men, so it's harder for an audience to relate. It's not about sweeping change in a depressing world like LotR, so it was never going to feel as dire.

"Afflock","9","10","22","15 December 2012"," Review of the adaptation and the HFR 3D
","Many reviews from the professional or amateur film critics have already gone over the story and mechanics. Wanted to write a general overview of the entertainment value and if the 3D is worth viewing.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson used additional writings of J.R.R. Token to make this film. The author wrote prolifically in the LoTR trilogy, epilogues, and works not published about the events of this story and Peter Jackson has added them to the film. This makes it longer than the book would have been on its own. It adds to the story but there are elements that were added by the screenwriters. The movie felt a little too long partly from the added story and that the source material is character driven more than action driven. It is an entertaining film and tells a good story. The acting is up to the high standards of the LoTR trilogy. It has more humor and is lighter in its theme, cinematography, and tone. It was written as a children's story but has been adapted to be more PG-13 with the fight scenes showing violence and blood in a realistic way.<br/><br/>I was able to catch the film in the High Frame Rate (HFR) 3D version (non-IMAX). The HFR 3D is filmed and shown as 48 Frames Per Second (FPS) as opposed to the movie industry standard 24 FPS. There is a noticeable difference. One nice part to this is it carries the same ticket price as standard 3D, no premium like the IMAX 3D. Regular 3D can darken the film a little. The HFR 3D was very bright and clear. It has a higher immersion affect than standard 3D. The best way to describe it is with an analogy, HFR 3D is to 3D what a standard CRT (tube) TV is to 1080P High Definition LED TV. It is much sharper and brighter. Special affects and makeup/costumes are more visible and sharp. There did appear to have a small negative to this, it is easier to spot CGI affects and makeup. The dwarf's bald caps and some actor's makeup were noticeable. It did take a little while to get used to how it changed the picture. For the movie buffs who understand the technical side, it appears as if no filter was used on the camera, it had a home video camera sharpness to it that lacked the smoothing of the images for the sets and actors. Though, the outdoor scenes were much more spectacular. The Shire was incredible! The mountain scenes were also incredible. Certain special affects were improved with the HFR 3D while others were more noticeable.<br/><br/>The HFR 3D is new technology to movie theaters and may not be for everyone, yet. If you are going to see it more than once in a theater, would suggest seeing it once in this form to decide for yourself. For me, it has many of the same strengths and weaknesses of HDTV, and the HFR 3D does look High Definition."
"Info-1367","5","26","70","9 December 2012"," LOTR Deja Vu
","Lord of the Rings part 1 The Directors Remix, would be a more apt title. If you value the wrapping over the present, then this film will satisfy you, or if you like repeats. Peter Jackson has decided to ignore the main concepts of The Hobbit and made LOTR all over again. Certainly not aimed at Mr Tolkein's target audience, evident by the 166min and 3 annual films runtime.<br/><br/>As usual the 3D aspect is great...for the first 10 minutes and very few people were ducking the first out-of-the-screen-debris shot, never mind the 8th. And the 48fps visuals are quite impressive, giving the viewer a real feel for being right there in the middle of it all....at the studio as they filmed it. The high definition begins to feel like a live TV recording after a while and occasionally the action looks a bit fast forwarded. Having also watched it with a Tolkein admirer I've been reliably informed that it misses on nearly level in relation to the book, including creatures and battles that just aren't in the original, the wrong overall tone of both the storyline and the characters (Jackson excusing himself with a 'foot in each camp' defence) and surprisingly too little character development! <br/><br/>Overall a flawed, overstretched, patchy repeat hiding behind a glossy exterior. No doubt it will be showered with fawning awards and fans will love it."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","11","25","14 December 2012"," Don't trust the critics, it's a great movie
","The Hobbit is an extraordinary movie and deserves a lot more than it is getting. For some reason critics are giving the movie ""average"" reviews which doesn't make sense. The reason for this is because of expectations. Critics expected the movie to be like The Lord of the Rings and they didn't get that. They got something a little bit different. But that is not a bad thing because The Hobbit is a really good movie.<br/><br/>So to clear things up expect something different than the Lord of the Rings. You will notice some similar elements but you will also notice some changes and this is because The Hobbit (book) was a lot more lighthearted than The Lord Of The Rings. The Hobbit is an adventure, the Lord of the Rings is an epic. This is what the movie does great at: it feels like the book The Hobbit and doesn't try to act like The Lord of The Rings. And it shouldn't try to be The Lord of The Rings because IT ISN'T!<br/><br/>One of the things that I loved about this movie that stood out the most to me was its great sense of humor and dialogue. The character interaction is very good and each character has their own specific traits and characteristics. I give two thumbs up to Martin Freeman for playing the perfect Bilbo Baggins. He truly mastered the role and I couldn't have asked it to be any other way. Back to humor, there were many (a LOT) of moments where the theater burst out into laughter. The movie is genuinely funny which is one of its greater aspects. Now don't get me wrong, the rest of the movie is great but I just wanted to point out that the movie is funny and the characters are very well made.<br/><br/>A lot of people have been bickering about the whole 48 frames per second thing (it was 48, right?) and I just wanted to say that you shouldn't worry. I heard a lot of problems and complaints about it but honestly if Peter Jackson had NEVER said that it was in 48 fps no one would've cared or even noticed. It looks great and really smooth. It didn't take away from the experience at all and I'm glad Peter Jackson filmed it in 48 fps.<br/><br/>For those of you concerned about plot changes you shouldn't worry too much. There are some plot changes and I wouldn't say that they were necessarily for the better but they didn't harm the plot. The changes were mainly to explain the Middle Earth universe better and to explain some things that are important to know but weren't in the Lord of The Rings (I'm looking at you Radagast The Brown) and I can say that Radagast was well done even though he wasn't entirely necessary. He was in The Lord of The Rings book but not movie so he had to be shown eventually.<br/><br/>The visual effects are very good and I recommend 3D but everyone has their own preferences. The CGI was very good and is , of course, well ahead of its time. If there is one gripe (and this is my only real gripe for the movie) it is that the movie uses CGI way too much. The movie was a CGI feast and didn't rely on the standard special effects of The Lord of The Rings. Why is this a problem? Because in 10 years CGI will look outdated but high quality special effects will never look outdated which The Lord of The Rings has proved. Also I would say that the animators got a little carried away with the King Goblin and his horde. It wasn't terrible but it was a lot less serious and didn't seem too threatening, but that is more accurate to the book.<br/><br/>Oh yeah and good job Andy Serkis! The scene with Gollum was priceless and very very well done. I was surprised with how well it came out and I was also shocked out how Gollum was lovable and scary at the same time. It was really good.<br/><br/>Overall The Hobbit was a really good movie. The acting was top notch, the humor was great, it followed the spirit of the book well and kept itself lighthearted at all times and it has an awesome soundtrack (though a lot of reused tracks). The only gripes for the movie is the use of too much CGI and a couple of distracting side plots which changed the pace of the movie randomly. Still an excellent movie. Go see it for yourself!"

","The film was just excellent, from beginning to very end I was submersed in what was truly an epic adventure, cannot wait to see the next installments now. <br/><br/>What really impressed me was the sense of humour used in the film along with great scenes that keep your heart racing. I would really recommend this film to anyone out there that enjoyed the book, and previous LOTR films. <br/><br/>I think negative reviews are a bit too over the top. Books are able to go into more detail, but when you are creating a film you have to visually create all important parts from the book, you can't possibly go into as much detail in films. The detail is less of the words and more in the visually aspects, and wow it really does keep your eyes on the screen! <br/><br/>The credit goes to how well the characters appear, and how well the geographical landmarks are represented by use of New Zealand's draw dropping scenery and landscape. <br/><br/>A lot of the credits also have to go to the artists and designers that create such amazing characters have done really well, the make-up artists in particular have done a great job on each character, and gives each one a personal trait. Really like the each individual touches to each dwarf, Bombur was so funny, seemed to be eating in nearly every scene, The CGI is also excellent, the dwarf kingdom Erebor looks really impressive in the opening scenes, and so does Rivendell, in fact every scene has excellent CGI from the shire, to Dol Guldur. <br/><br/>I think people should be less critical about certain aspects of Jacksons work and focus enjoying the film and watching some what truly magnificent pieces of cinema! <br/><br/>All the characters are played really well by an excellent cast, good mixture of heroic, evil and comical characters, make it such an all round great film! <br/><br/>Thanks Peter Jackson for making the best of what are my favourite books, I'm sure you will have made Tolkien a very happy man, as you have turned his excellent stories into a visual masterpiece!<br/><br/>10/10 for me, can't wait for the second and third now!"

","It was absolutely amazing, great graphics, quite funny where allowed, fast paced action, awesome character development (of old and new characters), a movie the whole family can enjoy, very well done!<br/><br/>The one thing I would have liked to see would have been real actors in costumes and makeup for the orcs like in the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>Still an amazing movie though! I definitely plan to see it again in theaters. It had much of the classic characteristics of the LOTR trilogy but with the multitude of new aspects you would hope for in a new blockbuster hit movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the aspects of the movie that make it more of a kids movie, how the original book was geared towards a younger audience, which resulted in a lot of comedy scattered throughout the film.<br/><br/>The scenery was absolutely amazing, be it real landscape shots to computer generated grand dwarven mines. I liked how the villains were revealed but in a non-obvious manner that partially concealed their identity, at least to those not very familiar with the story."
"fernparn","10","11","25","14 December 2012"," A Fantastic Voyage Indeed!
","After many months of waiting and expectation, I was finally able to see 'The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey' in its midnight showing. I had read many negative or mixed professional reviews, and I was very worried, seeing as I am a huge Tolkien fan. And now, after having watched the movie, I can honestly say to those critics: To the depths of Mordor with you! <br/><br/>There are very few things to complain about this movie. It remains mostly faithful to the Hobbit, and when it doesn't it remains faithful to Middle-Earth lore. I found myself actively cheering the protagonists on, my heart beating like an orc drum in my chest. And while some might say that cheering the protagonists on is what I am supposed to do in every movie, you are correct. And I do that, but in this movie, I felt like my own life would be affected by the outcome of the story.Coupled with the amazing scenery and incredible direction, I could not help being completely immersed in the story, an immersion that I have not felt in a fantasy movie since the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy. <br/><br/>BE WARNED! The Hobbit, as should be expected, is not as urgent as the 'LOTR' Trilogy. Remember, the dwarfs are not attempting to save the world as the Fellowship of the Ring was. Their goal is personal, and their success or failure would not determine the fate of Middle-Earth directly. Thus the movie does not have that 'Save the World' vibe. BUT, in contrast, the protagonist's quest is of such a personal level that as a viewer I could not help but be captivated and moved by it. Their quest became my quest. A truly I do not think a movie could hope to achieve more. I, for one, ardently disagree with many of the professional critics. Go view the movie yourselves, and be prepared to be transported back to the Middle- Earth we have missed so much."

I don't worry what others say because you have your opinions so with that stated, I say again this film was brilliant. First off the beauty of this entire series is beyond spectacular. The story lines are some of the most engaging I've ever come across. The actors seem to be of the finest cloaks, the humor is woven in so well that you feel it for real when you laugh . . .the magic of this film brought a smile to my face that I haven't had since the the first LOTR and a tear that hasn't been seen since LOTR ROTK.<br/><br/>I was amazed by Bilbo Baggins. . .I loved seeing his story come to life now. He is truly an extraordinary hobbit with such a big heart and strength to envy.<br/><br/>Sometimes there are movies where they are good and when they are over, you forget them in a few days but then there are films like this one and LOTR that when it's over you want more, you sing the songs, you relive your already favorite scenes. . .you crave for the next installment and as a movie lover I always aim to sit in the theater and come out amazed.<br/><br/>This is and will be a classic, no doubt. I cannot wait to see the next installment as I am sure it will be as fantastic as this one. Thorin OakenShield is my new Aragorn. However, the true light of this film is Bilbo as it should be. . .I also enjoyed seeing Galadriel and Lord Elrond.

Especially Gollum who is so dimensional, actually at one point I teared up because he was so cute (when you see the movie you will know.) The story is great, it's action packed and never leaves you bored or restless. Not even in the shire, the movie didn't feel long or dragged out - in fact it could almost be longer!<br/><br/>All the dwarfs are fun, the CGI is amazing (the trolls, OH MY GOD, it felt like they were actually real!) except for Azog the Defiler who for some reason felt a little too unreal, but it definitely wasn't bad! <br/><br/>I loved every second of this movie and I'm definitely going to see it again, but don't compare it to LOTR because it's not. This is The Hobbit so enjoy it for what it is and you won't be disappointed!<br/><br/>I saw this in 48 FPS, which was really odd at first. But like everyone else said you do get used to it after a while. It really depends on who is watching to tell if it's good or not, i'd probably say that if you're content with the usual 24 fps format and don't really like change then don't watch it but if you're feeling adventurous and is open for new things i'd say go for it!<br/><br/>Can't wait for Desolation of Smaug!"

","The first time I heard about the release of the first film of the Hobbit trilogy, at first I know that this is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. At the moment that I first watched this movie, I was really amazed on the direction and acting style of the actors especially to Martin Freeman. Martin Freeman was really appropriate for the role as Bilbo Baggins showing his profound sense of the personality of a Baggins and at the same time a Took.<br/><br/>Recently, I read the Revised Edition of The Hobbit Novel. Yes, most of the events mentioned in the book happened in the film. The tough explanation of Bilbo and the company's escape from the Misty Mountains was one proof.<br/><br/>Lastly,the excellent and professional riddles that were mentioned both in the book and the film were surprisingly amazing. This film is one of the best films I've seen in my entire life. Amazing direction by Peter Jackson."
"irishsounds","3","5","9","10 June 2013"," I found it a big let-down compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy
","Let me open by saying that I totally enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy and watched all three parts a total of four times to date. I savoured the texture and sheer quality of almost every aspect of these works. Above all the design, the direction, the musical scores, the acting, and the editing were superb. I was therefore really looking forward to seeing the Hobbit.<br/><br/>It would appear that my experience of the Hobbit goes against the tide of general opinion. Truth is, I simply did not enjoy The Hobbit, not in the least.<br/><br/>For me it was a resounding let-down! The Hobbit had me bored stiff within 45 minutes, and I left after one hour, I just could not take any more of it. Maybe I was in a funny mood or having a bad hair day, I was just bored by it. At some later stage, in a few month time perhaps, I will try and watch it again. If my experience is very different, I will write another review, and apologise to Peter Jackson, and the many fans of The Hobbit.<br/><br/>The general feel that came over to me from the film was one of; ""the return of .... part 18"", a dim after-image, an echo of an original and fine musical score, and, to my perception, a pantomime approach when compared with Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The pace was intolerably slow, many of the characters were no more than plastic Muppets. So I quickly became frustrated but decided to wait and see if it picked up a bit, how often I have done that at a movie, and how often my first instinct proved right.<br/><br/>Sad to say, it just dragged on and on at the same – lame pace, with hardly a sparkle of craftsmanship, the enthusiasm, the inventiveness, the visual beauty, and sheer genius that were so present in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>All I can say to The Hobbit is, that from my experience, Peter Jackson seems to have dropped the ball on this one."
"pmstone3","5","5","9","6 April 2013"," Below my expectations
","I am a life long fan of Tolkien. I've read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy countless times. Needless to say I was excited when the Lord of the Rings was made into a movies, or I should say, movies. I was not disappointed. A truly epic adventure. Likewise, I've been anxiously awaiting The Hobbit. I have to say I'm more then a little disappointed. I'm afraid I've seen what happens when common sense takes a back seat to corporate greed and/or ambition. It made sense for the Lord of the Rings to be three long movies. After all, it was based on three long books. But The Hobbit story simply doesn't contain enough material to make a 9 hour epic. What we got is a 9 hour epic bore. Oh, the acting is outstanding. Martin Freeman was the perfect choice to play a young Bilbo. The sets are breathtaking. The effects are marvelous. As expected. But the story is where it fails. The producers had to add so much padding to the film to fill out the 9 hours that movie has an unbelievably SLOW pace. Scene after scene of pointless inactivity that adds nothing to the story line whatsoever. It's there just to fill out the run time. I found myself yawning repeatedly. I am so much reminded of the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.....""Get on with it"". Found myself saying that more then once during this movie."

I'm going to try to express what is wrong with this movie without spoiling it. 1:There should only be ONE movie, not three. I say this because The Hobbit isn't that long of a book. My copy is 306 pages. I know that Peter Jackson used material from Tolkien's notes, but that is the kind of thing that should only be in an extended edition. But, instead it makes up the almost the whole movie. The general plot of the movie is the same as the book. There just isn't enough material to make three movies. 2:This movie is too long. This movie is so long and stretched out that it makes it hard to watch. This movie didn't need to be 3 hours long especially because nothing happens except for Bilbo leaves, he finds the ring, and they all fight goblins. There are problems beyond this, but if you want to really know them, see the movie. I recommend this movie only to hardcore fans of the series."

Fair enough you had Bilbo and golum giving each other riddles under the mountain, and Bilbo escaping by means of accidentally putting on the ring, which made him invisible... but other than it being a prequel to LOTF the story again in my opinion was very flat.... bunch of dwarfs loose there home because of a gold hungry dragon - later generations of dwarfs run around trying to re-claim their home...<br/><br/>The conclusion...a butterfly whispered to by a wizard went to notify a big pack of huge eagles to rescue the party from burning tree tops - pretty much how the movie ended!"

","The Hobbit is an enjoyable enough movie, although it's too long. This is a children's book, it doesn't need endless LOTR tie-ins and the other additional material. This movie suffers from Peter Jackson's self indulgence, and the simple story is almost lost in the scramble for tie- ins, back-stories, marketable action figures and a sense of sweeping grandeur.<br/><br/>I shudder to think what the extended edition on DVD will be like (and we all know there is one to come.) <br/><br/>On the upside, there are some funny moments with the dwarfs descending on Bilbo Baggins' house and the interactions of a number of characters.<br/><br/>I gave it 6 - but would love Peter J to lift his game and just tell the story."

","Overly long with nothing much happening for long periods. The pace of the film was pedantic at best and I found myself losing interest quite easily. When the action parts started they were very good and entertaining its just the bits in between that had me nodding off. I gave it 5 / 10 but the action parts are good so 8 /10 for the action parts alone. The overall 5 / 10 is because it was slow in telling the story . Like Avatar I was expecting great things and came out of the cinema in a so so frame of mind but were Avatar copied the core in regard to unobtainium and had the ending like the Lion King and circle of life and all that, this film has at least left me optimistic about the sequel."
"JKuneDo","1","17","43","14 December 2012"," Tolkien is rolling in his grave
","This is not ""The Hobbit"" it is a fantasy story that uses similar names and scenario to portray a pop culture, cheesy actioned ADHD and altogether shallow portrayal of something similar to what Tolkien wrote. Even Tolkien himself said - others are inclined to say that any two stories that are built round the same folk-lore motive, or are made up of a generally similar combination of such motives, are ""the same stories."" Statements of that kind are not true, they are not true in art or literature. It is precisely the colouring, the atmosphere, the unclassifiable individual details of a story, and above all the general purport that informs with life the undissected bones of the plot, that really count. It seems to me that the essential quality and aptitudes of a given language in a living monument is both more important to seize and far more difficult to make explicit than its linear history. I would say: ""We must be satisfied with the soup that is set before us. By ""the soup"" I mean the story as it is served up by its author or teller."
"communicator-1","5","17","43","13 December 2012"," Stretched to the Max
","Ever hear the old expression, ""Making a Mountain out of a Mole Hill""? Well that's exactly what we have here. Stretching a book that was less than one third the size of The Lord of the Rings Trilogies into three films, is more than a bit of a stretch. Originally planned as one film, it was later announced that there would be two films, and finally three. Why not four, or five? While I definitely felt that the original trilogy was done for love of the material, this one feels like it was done for the love of money.<br/><br/>While the production assets are top quality, and the acting is fine, the entire project feels bloated beyond reason. For that simple reason, I cannot recommend this film."
"anthony-zappia","9","8","17","29 December 2012"," A wonderful interpretation of the classic.
","I never thought anyone could turn a book like The Hobbit into 3 movies, but Peter Jackson has in his interpretation of Tolkien's classic. People expecting a replica of the book will be disappointed. There is much embellishment in the story, but I think it's appropriate and well done. For example, in the film, you get a short history of the Thorin's people - how they lost Erebor, their kingdom and their struggle with the Orcs and Goblins. You get a strong sense of this theme running in this film; of these people, these dwarfs being like refugees - people without a home, driven from their homes by war, who will go to great costs to regain what they've lost (is this Peter Jackson's commentary on the world refugee crisis?). The sets, costumes and make-up are great. And Howard Shore's movie score is as usual fantastic. Looking forward to the next instalments, but gosh we must wait so long to see the entire thing."
"iforgot17125","9","8","17","25 December 2012"," All I could ever ask of The Hobbit!
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an impossible standard of a trilogy. The Hobbit is an entertaining, heartwarming, and humorous film that nobody will recognize that views it with a critical eye. <br/><br/>Having seen it in 48 frames per second I see why people dislike the technology. As a teenage film critic I couldn't help but notice the mistakes. The speed of the frames is jarring at first, many things that would look real look fake...then, I start seeing plates flying, start hearing the dwarfs sing, and start feeling the emotion and humor and the action starts and I'm entranced in the likability of the film. Slowly I'm not watching a movie but being transported into Middle Earth. The frame rate stops becoming annoying and starts enhancing the experience. <br/><br/>If you treat this like a movie you won't enjoy the fun. If you try to treat it like actual events in the Lord of the Rings series you miss the point of the film. Bilbo is recalling the story from his memory, and like Gandalf says in the movie, ""All good stories deserve embellishment."" This is the way it's being told, maybe not how it happened. <br/><br/>The editing is slower than modern films. Many complained about the pace, but every scene has a purpose in future sequels, no scene is poorly written, and I loved every single one of these characters, including the trippy Radagast. <br/><br/>48 frames isn't perfect yet, isn't the new standard, but a new way to watch film. If you find yourself too attached to the cinematic experience this will be different. It's not headache 3D, it gives the feeling of a live performance with awesome effects, and gives HD minus the annoyance. I love it! It turns of the film critic and brings in the story lover.<br/><br/>This deserves a 10, it is by far the most immersive films of the year, but because it is a prequel to a superior series I cannot raise expectations too high. My advice is put your 3D glasses on, your notepad down, and enjoy a new way of viewing cinema."
"sledgehammer86","6","8","17","25 December 2012"," Wonderful production values, but lacks substance
","Going into The Hobbit, it was always going to be about expectations. I must admit my expectations were very low. However, I went in with an open mind. The Hobbit was not as bad as I thought it would be, not a failure either: the production simply is too good. But it does not come close to The Lord of the Rigns either.<br/><br/>One prejudice I had going before actually seeing it was that the splitting into three separate movies was induced by greed for cash. I was wrong. Having seen this, I am now convinced it was indeed a wrong decision to make three movies, but for a very different reason than I thought. Peter Jackson wants to tell every single line of the novel (and the LOTR appendix he used). This is actually a very admirable motive, clearly something a fan would do. The total opposite of milking an audience. But when translating novel to movie, such an approach does not work. An Unexpected Journey almost solely focuses on secondary matters, with perhaps only 20% of screen time contributing to the essential story. Three full-fledged movies for The Lord of the Rings were justified as there was a fleshed out story available. Three movies were mandatory there to tell the story right. This first entry into the new trilogy lacks such a substance. I truly think were this movie made before the success of TLOR a second set of eyes would have intervened, saying: ""Cut this and that"", resulting in a tighter result (not three movies, but one long or two short). Jackson had carte blanche now and was able to fulfill his dream of filming every line of the novel and more. Admirable, but not tight and substantial.<br/><br/>Still, the production values are stunning. Martin Freeman is well-cast as a young Bilbo too. The landscapes are beautiful again. I must admit the first ten minutes were as good as any of the best scenes of TLOR too. If only there were more of it."
"Matt_Layden","8","8","17","23 December 2012"," 48 Frames: An Unexpected Journey
","A mild-mannered Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins is tasked with joining a group of Dwarfs, lead by Gandalf, to the Lonely Mountain in the hopes of claiming their home and gold back from the dragon Smaug. <br/><br/>When word first broke out that Jackson would be splitting the 300 some odd pages of the children aimed book The Hobbit, into another epic trilogy, a lot of people groaned at how thin he would be able to stretch the material. In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, everything and anything that would have ended up on the cutting room floor is thrown in here, such as the Rock Giants. Why? Is it because The Hobbit lacks the thrills and spectacle that is the Lord of the Rings. I'm going to put my bottom dollar on yes. Jackson needed something to fill his films with in order to excite the audience, thrill them and make them have the same awe they did more than a decade ago.<br/><br/>I want to say that The Hobbit works wonderfully, and it does for the most part. There are obvious flaws throughout, but my question is this. How do you rate a film, when it is presented in a format so distracting that it hurts your overall enjoyment of it? Not only am I talking about the use of 3D, but the infamous 48 HFR which it is presented. Let me get these two issues out of the way first.<br/><br/>The 3D here is utterly useless. There are basically two kinds of 3D being presented to an audience right now. The Gimmick and the Immersive. The gimmick is what one would see in the Saw 3D, Final Destination 3D....any horror film really. Gags that poke out at the screen with gotcha moments. The second, the kind that James Cameron is trying to champion is the immersive one, in which the 3D makes you feel like you are in this world. Objects aren't really shooting out at you, but float around you. The most horrid use of 3D, many would have to agree is Clash of the Titans, but I must say, The Hobbit might give it a run for its money. Not once did I ever feel immersed in Middle Earth. It was not used to the scope and scale it should have been. There was depth, sure, but who wants to see depth with two people talking? It is distracting and overworks the brain to compensate for the film trickery. <br/><br/>Second, the 48 HFR. I would suggest that the average movie goer seek out 24. I know Jackson wants to present the film in 48, but it is simply the wrong movie for this format. First and most noticeable. People move quicker, like they are on fast-forward of your DVD remote. Simple task like picking up a cup, are too quick and make for an awkward and unpleasant viewing experience. Later on this is not as intrusive, but most of the damage will already be done. Second, the clear, crispness of the picture. I am one for HD presentation on my television, but here it seems odd and out of place. Many people have compared the look and feel of the film to daytime Soap Operas. I would tend to agree. It feels like something on TV. The digital presentation makes close up scenes seem really out of place when cutting in from afar. Those far away shots and sequences looks spectacular, most of the CGI is wonderfully realized in this frame rate, but everything sticks out like a sore thumb. The first thing I noticed was the fabric and lines on Gandalfs hat. Feels like it was something out of The Wizard of Oz, or a stage play. The realism of the smoothed over 24 is gone, the digital crisp of 48 is a win/lose situation. I had more problems with it than enjoyment. <br/><br/>With those problems constantly battling my enjoyment back to Middle Earth, I did walk away pleasantly surprised with the film. Everyone is on their A-game, which is of no surprise as Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman are always spectacular. Freeman manages to make a character I didn't care for in the original films, likable. Peter Jackson loves this world and his passion shows. One of the drawbacks would be that the film comes off as too cartoonish. This might be because the book was aimed to a younger crowd, but the Dwarfs and their antics are something out of a Star Wars prequel. Sure, they are meant to be comedic relief, but when dangerous and life threatening situations are happening, you don't want to be seeing them jump from tree to tree like some Warner Brothers cartoon. <br/><br/>Of course, being a prequel, it's fun to see things being set-up for the Lord of the Rings. The best sequences is of course the Riddles in the Dark with Gollum, who looks better than ever. The Hobbit is a wonderful film, that doesn't match the scope, energy or emotion of the Lord of the Rings. Go in expecting a good fantasy, nothing more and you'll walk away satisfied....that's if you walk away from a screening in 24 fps.<br/><br/>Leave 48 for Animated and Planet Earth like content."

It is very similar to the first Lord of the Rings film where it isn't the most action packed but it does have a great story and all the characters blend into it really well and are easily liked and enjoyed. There is a certain amount of humour especially from the dwarfs but what can you expect, that is their personality from the books therefore it had to be portrayed on screen and it did give it a family element to the film yet it didn't stray too far from the seriousness of the story.<br/><br/>Very solid acting, the scenery is fantastic (I only watched in 2D) and the film I enjoyed thoroughly.

It's hard to sometimes separate the fiction from fact when I feel like I know these characters as well as I know myself.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has proved with LoTR that he knows Tolkien's work intimately and he treated the material with care and love, labouring over details, producing a masterpiece and additional materials that really is every fangirl's (or boys) dream.<br/><br/>I went into The Hobbit with very little idea apart from knowledge of the book and who had been cast in some of the lead roles. This was on purpose. I really didn't want to spoil anything for myself, and I wanted to invariably avoid anyone else's opinion on what the movie SHOULD be or IS before having actually seen it.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, anyone who claims that The Hobbit is ""too much of the same"" or ""not distinct enough"" from LoTR would be right. But that's the point isn't it? This is THE SAME WORLD. This is some of THE SAME CHARACTERS. And really, it's glorious.<br/><br/>After almost a decade since RoTK, I sat in the cinema with the goofiest grin. The movie opens with snippets of the Trilogy's amazing score, dispersed among new pieces of music. It makes you feel nostalgic, sweeps you back into Middle Earth seamlessly and leaves you feeling like you're back among old friends.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to see Elijah Wood as Frodo. It was a wonderful surprise. To have The Hobbit segue so neatly right where the FoTR begins is fantastic. Here and there, to be able to piece together places, names, characters and see the groundwork for events you know plays out in the LoTR trilogy just blows your mind.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen was cast in one of the most iconic roles in fiction. And it has immortalised him as Aragorn, the King of Men forever. He had an on screen presence that commanded attention and made us believe he was capable of being the King he was destined to be – even before he was ready to assume the mantle.<br/><br/>Richard Armitage is that person in The Hobbit. As Thorin Oakenshield he has commands your eyes and ears, taking over every frame, making you search for him whenever he is in the throng of Dwarvish companions. He is magnetic, he is magnificent and dare I say the sexiest Dwarf to grace our screens – ever.<br/><br/>Like Viggo, Richard also sings. The deep, dark baritone works perfectly with what I assume is the Trilogy's main theme. He is magnificent. And the score is breathtakingly beautiful. Howard Shore deserves serious accolades.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman imbues Bilbo with bewilderment and uncertainty, but a stout heart. The chemistry between the cast is just as it was with LoTR. They complement one another in all the right ways. The brotherhood, the companionship evident.<br/><br/>Everything about The Hobbit feels familiar. And yet it's just as exciting as the trilogy that came before it. I would caution against expecting a reinvention of the wheel. This is a world created in such detail, why would you want a new spin on it? Instead, we get to revisit this wondrous place, this eternal Middle Earth. And we get to partake in a new adventure.<br/><br/>It is an unexpected journey, but an exhilarating one."
"kellow","10","9","20","18 December 2012"," The Hobbit that Tolkein probably wished he'd written
","The Hobbit is being slated in many reviews for being excessively long and convoluted, due to Jackson's over-indulgence and the addition of too many subplots that turn a simple children's story into a fantasy epic along the lines of Tolkein's other great masterpiece.<br/><br/>Jackson should be commended, not criticised. Rather than produce a family-sized Christmas package for the popcorn munching crowd, he has done full justice to Tolkein's work. There will probably never be another movie version of The Hobbit in our lifetimes, and if a job's worth doing, then to hell with Hollywood tradition, and do the job well! The true Tolkein fan is in for a treat, because rather than rush the story to suit filmic convention, Jackson shows every detail. This creates pacing issues for the casual film-goer, but is an absolute delight for those of who have waited most of our lives to finally see a live-action version of one of the most popular books ever written.<br/><br/>Tolkein himself had many issues with The Hobbit. It was only later that he started creating the true complexities of Middle Earth, and even made an aborted attempt to rewrite the book in the true context of his imagined world – in which we know the true significance of Gollum, the ring, the Necromancer, the backstory of the dwarfs and elves and so much more. In many ways, Jackson's Hobbit is the one Tolkein himself wished he had written, a much darker and more complex visitation without the talking animals or the Enid Blyton-esque feel to the elves and goblins.<br/><br/>Every scene and piece of major dialogue from the book are included, the issue for Tolkein traditionalists will be the additions. 'Less is more' is not an expression in Jackson's vocabulary, the stone giants and chase in Goblin Town were so over-the-top that they drown out more subtle moments and serve to remove much of the dramatic tension. As our heroes escape unscathed time and again from the most ridiculous of perils, these situations start becoming more comical than foreboding.<br/><br/>The ending was the only departure from the book that perhaps spoiled it. As in LOTR, we have Jackson's gimmick of trying to make us believe that a major character has died, followed by an uncharacteristic bit of swashbuckling heroism from Bilbo that leads to his redemption with Thorin – which book readers know should really happen under far more emotional circumstances much later in the story."
"drummerhero2438","8","9","20","15 December 2012"," A solid, greatly entertaining introduction
","Key questions come to mind for those who have yet to see this movie. One is: is it as good as the Lord of the Rings films? While I personally believe it is not, that is beyond the point. The Hobbit is a separate story in itself with a different narrative feel, that happens to take place in the same environment. Don't walk into this film expecting it to feel like another Lord of the Rings film, and keep an open mind. One of the other main questions regards the disappointingly mixed critical reception behind the film. As a person who usually cares about critic reviews before seeing films, I must advise you all FORGET ABOUT THE CRITICS ON THIS ONE. ""An Unexpected Journey"" is a fantastic introduction to the three-part series, and will likely follow with even better sequels to follow. The same idea can be said about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 was rated amongst the worst of the Harry Potter films, even though the screen time itself was great when taken in context to the following final act. The same will be said about ""An Unexpected Journey"". Could it have been better? Sure, there were some areas the film could have done without. On the whole though, this is still a very entertaining fantasy movie, and one which I wouldn't mind seeing another time or two. It perhaps didn't blow me away like ""Return of the King"" had or the final battle in ""Two Towers"", but it is still a film I can highly recommend for any fan of Lord of the Rings to go see with some friends or family. 8/10 : B+"
"u_sims","9","9","20","15 December 2012"," A fantastic start to what will hopefully become another great trilogy.
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of Peter Jackson's planned trilogy based on J.R.R Tolkien's precursor to The Lord of the RIngs, The Hobbit. Various stars from The Lord of the Rings return here, such as Ian McKellen, Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, 90 year-old Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Andy Serkis' spectacular motion capture Gollum. New faces include Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, ex-Doctor Who Sylvester McCoy, Lee Pace, Graham McTavish, Ken Stott, James Nesbitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Manu Bennett and Barry Humphries.<br/><br/>This film starts with old Bilbo Baggins writing down his adventures with the Dwarfs in The Lonely Mountain for his nephew Frodo. Then, 60 years earlier, Martin Freeman is young, content with his quaint, quiet lifestyle in Bag End. That is, until mysterious wizard Gandalf the Grey and a company of 12 dwarfs. After that, he is whisked off on adventures in the dangers of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>This was a really great film. Although I don't like one relatively short book being drawn out into three 2-and- a-half-hour films, I had faith in Peter Jackson after he brought us LOTR before. I like the way they managed to take small parts in the book and made them longer, as well as adding in some good stuff also. Howard Shore once again knocks it out of the park with a magnificent score, and the action is enjoyable and really fun. Also, this is the funniest of any Lord of the Rings-related film; most of it at the expense of the dwarfs. The riddle scene was amazing; Gollum was better than ever here. The character of Bilbo was brilliant, good character development and an awesome performance from Martin Freeman. My gripes with it? It is a little overlong. It was acceptable to have 4-hour epics with The Lord of the Rings as each one was a separate book. Here, there are some pacing issues as some parts are dragged out. Also, yet I think this will be resolved in the next parts, The Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again, the dwarfs' characters (with the exception of Thorin and Balin) were not fleshed out enough, and you didn't get to know them enough here. However, overall this is a great film, and I can't wait for its successors.<br/><br/>Finally, I would just like to congratulate the film-makers on adding in a wonderful Wilhelm Scream from a goblin. It's nice to see they're still being used."
"nenad-jones","7","9","20","15 December 2012"," That was amazing!
","After I read up all the critical rubbish about the movie I can tell you - I was afraid they might have messed up big time.<br/><br/>The high score here ( 8.7 at this time) could have been from fans and die hard fanatics of the series, and the critics pointed out everything - from bad acting and cheesy story, overblown special effects and childish monsters, and even the length and use of 48 fps... And me, the idiot, believed them and went to the theater expecting to be let down - BOY was I wrong there!<br/><br/>The movie was amazing! For the whole 3 hours I was glued to my seat and when the movie ended - the whole theater audience stood up and gave a thunderous applause, now that should say something about how good the movie was. Given that I am a fan of the series and enjoyed the return to Middle Earth, I'm giving this movie a full 10 - now I just have to wait for the second part, and when that's done, for the third one... Ah man, I HATE waiting! :D"
"aakinz","10","9","20","15 December 2012"," A visual treat, just like LOTR
","First of all, The Hobbit, as we all know, is a prequel to the LOTR. So technically, there would be nothing different. How can it be any different?. It will be the same Shire or Rivendell or Mountains or any creature. So The Hobbit will not satisfy the viewers who are expecting surprise like the LOTR did. Story, its about the hobbit, who is not a brave warrior or hero. So, stop expecting another surprising film like LOTR. This will be a familiar film for all the LOTR fans.<br/><br/>If you cut down your expectation, You have everything to look for. This film has a nice story, wonderful action sequences, very good performances and ground breaking visual effects. Cast and the technical team did their job perfectly. You don't need know anything else actually.<br/><br/>Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing the Middle Earth to big screen again, that too in 3D."
"lim_hengyu95","10","10","23","24 December 2012"," A PERFECT movie interpretation of a wonderful tale
","Initially a little crestfallen and rather sceptical after reading the numerous negative reviews, I left the theatre wanting to immediately have another viewing of this amazing film.<br/><br/>If you have read the books and enjoy the lore and world Tolkien has so meticulously crafted, I personally guarantee that you WILL love this film. <br/><br/>The casting and acting of the main characters were all but perfect, the visuals stunning and the music captures the emotions perfectly as it did in the LOTR films. <br/><br/>The film generally sticks very closely to the book(s) save a few additions and changes which barely detract from the experience.<br/><br/>The only argument that I might ever agree with against this film was that the dwarfs, save a few of them, saw too little character development and there was little to remember them by. However, this problem was also in the novel and you could hardly blame the film for this. I can also understand the worries about the 48FPS although I am personally alright with it.<br/><br/>None of the ""additions"" into the film were lore-breaking - in fact, almost all of them came directly from the appendices from the text itself.<br/><br/>Going through the numerous negative reviews, I have to say that most of the criticisms are hardly valid, the most confounding and stupid ones going in the lines of these:<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT (MAYBE)*<br/><br/>""The references to Sauron/The Necromancer were shameless advertisements of PJ's earlier films""<br/><br/>WHAT?! WHAT?! Seriously?! This comment was made by a mainstream critic and I am not even going to elaborate why this is frankly one of the stupidest statement made in journalism history.<br/><br/>""The violence in the film goes against everything Tolkien stood for""<br/><br/>.........??? <br/><br/>Some of the comments about the runtime were cogent, but many were unfounded and simply rubbish. Critics and haters alike jump onto this bandwagon and the argument will always revolve around PJ artificially stretching out the runtime to put the films in a trilogy.<br/><br/>However it is hard to agree with these comments when you have comments like these: ""The film milks every detail of the text"", ""And the scene with gollum just went on and on with so many riddles."" which hardly make any sense.<br/><br/>I'd like to point out that the Hobbit film was about the same in length as a LOTR film, and the LOTR films had serious omissions, one of which being about a quarter of the first book. (where Frodo and friends were making to Bree through the Old Forest) While I agree that the Hobbit was a very short book relative to the LOTR books, the runtime gives PJ a great opportunity to add onto the film using additional material (that is entirely CANON) from Tolkien, and I hardly see how that is detrimental to the film.<br/><br/>In overall it is clear that the extremely negative reviews stem from unfounded criticisms from haters who are hardly able to justify and/or elaborate on their views. If you enjoy Tolkien's material, you WILL love this film. I can assure you this much."
"harrisonvoss4","10","10","23","15 December 2012"," A Film Worth Remembering
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is by far a film masterpiece. With stunning 3D images and beautiful landscape shots this film certainly deserves an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Andy Serkis's performance as Gollum was by far the best in this film, while Martin Freeman shined out as the lead role. Ian Mckellan's performance too was at it's peak as Gandalf in this film. However, I must say his role as Gandalf the White in the Return of the King perhaps matched this performance as well. He transforms into the believable Gandalf that uses magic more than ever in the previous films. Not once did I sit bored when watching this movie nor wish I wasn't there. Ignore the comments of the critics, this movie is as good as the Lord of the Rings film and deserves to be watched by everyone."
"musica1","10","10","23","15 December 2012"," Perfection!
","The Hobbit seemed like it would be a difficult book to make into a movie. In one way, it is a silly children's book with some silly characters. But the situations these characters get into are really life threatening and scary! Also, even though they are continuations of the same story, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have very different tones, with LOTR being very serious throughout. <br/><br/>I should not have worried, though. In Peter Jackson's capable hands, An Unexpected Journey, the first part of The Hobbit comes to life in a beautiful way! He captures the silly moments, but tones them down just enough that they blend with the harrowing and frightening situations encountered on the journey without seeming jarring. The acting is all top notch with Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins being completely lovable and charming! In this first part of the story, we are just getting to know all the dwarfs and their tales, but already we are rooting for them!<br/><br/>I've seen this movie in regular 2D and in IMAX 3D 48 fps and enjoyed it equally both ways. The movie was more visually brilliant in the 3D 48 fps, but that was offset somewhat by the distracting reflections I continually saw in the periphery of y 3D glasses. <br/><br/>I highly recommend it his movie!"
"Flyingw56","10","10","23","15 December 2012"," Peter Jackson does it again
","Like all good stories there is always a beginning, middle and end. An Unexpected Journey sets the ground work for the next two installments just as the Fellowship did for LOTR. My first viewing was in 3D, I must admit the 3D did take about 20 minutes for my brain to adapt, it is done just right and does not to sacrifice the story line for the visual effects of 3D, wearing the 3D glasses for the trailers that are also in 3D helps the adjustment. The movie itself does not disappoint, another Peter Jackson masterpiece, when the movie ends after almost three hours you are left wanting more, the mark of a great movie. Rating this movie a ten does not give it justice, there are good, great and movies that sets the bar such as this one. Can't wait to see it in 64fps."
"sujithdan","10","10","23","15 December 2012"," Excellent movie
","After 9 years from the LOTR, the prequel had left me thinking what will Peter Jackson do with Hobbit, after all the controversies and legal issues the movie went through (the delays), I had hoped this movie to release soon...Right from the first scene of the movie, it is subtle, clear and evenly paced which gives all audiences the time to enjoy each and every scene of this movie, this is a unique feat of this movie..No comparisons to LOTR, but the sequel gives fantasy a new standard and by seeing the movie, one will understand what to expect from fantasy films..The direction and screenplay are excellent, so is special effects, cinematography and background score...The 3D effects bring in a whole new dimension..From the fight scenes to the birds flying, from the dragon to the battle of storm giants, the movie is slowly gripping and it matters as it is a considerably lengthy movie, but the best thing is it pays justice to the world Tolkien had created as well as the book..The climax will make people waiting for the second installment in the trilogy...If you are patient to spend some time, you will never regret the pace but will enjoy the best fantasy movie of the year."
"Set_Summanen","8","10","23","12 December 2012"," With great standards comes great responsibility.
","The Hobbit is a superb film compared to the vast majority of other films ever made. The story is great and very accurate to the book (compared to the LOTR trilogy) and will most likely create a brand new generation of Tolkien fans just as the Peter Jackson trilogy from a decade ago. As big of a Tolkien fan I may be myself I still can't get myself convinced that this film deserves a flawless 10/10 or even a 9/10. There are reasons why this is a great movie but not a perfect one:<br/><br/>To anyone going to see the film in 48 FPS in 3D you will notice, even in the very first scenes, that the quality and sharpness of the image possibly makes it look too realistic. I can only describe it as looking like a documentary. One might at first thought believe this to be great without understanding what it actually does for the film. I can only describe this from my own personal viewpoint, but I believe it took away the magic fantasy atmosphere. During the special effects-heavy scenes with a lot of CGI it made the animated creatures and such look just as if they were present in the theater with you. The exterior scenes are beautiful as beautiful can be, but the interior scenes such as the ones from Bag End look like man-made scenes filled with props at a theatrical play where the actors have top notch make-up and wigs, but you still notice that it's just that: make-up and wigs. Sometimes the film has a bit too many jokes in an attempt to constantly amuse the viewer and the same goes with overly unrealistic action filled scenes (dwarfs standing on a falling wooden bridge continued by them using it as a skateboard-like object, dwarfs juggling the dishes, rabbit-driven sled which goes 300 mph leaving no tracks, etc.)<br/><br/>There ends all of the negativity towards the film.<br/><br/>The acting is great and the friendship between the dwarven pack (+ wizard and hobbit) is very warm and ""realistic"". If you have seen and liked the LOTR trilogy you will instantly feel warm at heart as both the old Bilbo and Frodo are in the first scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the landscape views are the most stunning and beautiful I have ever seen, just because of the 48 FPS 3D. Rivendell looks just as beautiful as it always did and the elven feel is not gone from the heavily dwarven film.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>The greatest scenes are short but really add that feel needed to bring anyone into the Tolkien world at max.<br/><br/>The butterfly that Gandalf spots which leads to the eagles coming (just as in LOTR) was the best 3D piece of the whole film. It flies in front of your eyes without flaws.<br/><br/>The best scene is when Bilbo meets Gollum by the lake inside of the mountain. The chemistry between the two is some of the best there could be and the acting itself is magical on both actors' parts. If there is anytime during the film when you don't understand that you are actually watching a film, this is it."
"abdulx","3","11","26","16 December 2012"," Good Movie overall but suffers MAJOR bad decisions by Peter Jackson & co
","I liked the Hobbit AUJ but didn't enjoy it much (i'll come to why in a bit), I'm not a big fan of 3D, it confuses me & causes me strain. But HFR 3D is a leap ahead in terms of 3D Technology, a lot more comfortable to watch and Watching The Hobbit @ HFR is like looking outside your window. However, 2D might be a better experience, maybe 2D HFR, so i might rewatch it again in 2D.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a good movie, make no mistake, It is not as Memorable as LOTR(possibly forgettable movie) Peter Jackson doesn't fail to visualize the movie just the way i imagined it when i read the book. However The movie Suffers from MAJOR mistakes, unfortunately i wish PETER Jackson NEVER Made, which for me ruined the experience. So why give this movie 3/10 ? Here are some very valid reasons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Peter Jackson is confused, He wants to make the Hobbit independent of LOTR, then he tries to link it with LOTR, which ended up in a huge mess.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Peter Jackson &amp; Co RECYCLED A lot OF LOTR soundtrack, HUGE mistake. The Hobbit OST should be THE Hobbit, but we are constantly reminded the link to LOTR movie when The hobbit is NOT LOTR, constantly we are played the exact same LOTR track</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too many REFERENCES to MODERN DAY HUMOR, one of the dwarfs uses a ""YOU Don't HAVE THE BALLS FOR IT"" wth PEter jackson u kidding me ? . When they are burying some gold, the dwarf says ""WE R MAKING A LONG TERM DEPOSIT"" again wth PEter Jackson, yeah we get it ur talking about our modern day banking system. This is just a few examples of many modern day jokes which ruin the movie. It also disconnects you.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Thorin CHARGES Azog, PEter Jackson uses THE WITCH KING's soundtrack, why ??? That track belongs to the witch king, you have such a talented composer, use original music ! Again, poor use of recycled music ruined the move</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>AZOG's character design, is OUT of PLACE , he looks very cartoonish. When i saw him i immediately felt that this is not right. LOTR put in place the way ORCs look like, Peter jackson should've stuck to his original design.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lack of blood, when orcs are sliced, no black blood , just heads falling apart. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Movie is confused between satisfying ADULT LOTR fans &amp; being a children movie. PEter jackson should've stuck to ONE theme and made up his mind. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Humor in general is crap, when the Goblin King is slayed, he says a JOKE before dying, WTH come on PJ give us a break . Again the movie can't get a tone straight, either being serious or a light hearted movie it can't make up its mind. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Scene with trolls is great, but the trolls are shown as really funny, childish snot joke, one second the scene is humorous next second and they are being sliced at brutally, this scene was v badly done.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Goblin King is killed, he makes a JOKE before HE DIED, wth...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Again the HUMOR is rubbish, not funny at all (most of it).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Thorin's character is a copy of Boromir, in the book they were very different but Thorin is just like Boromir in this movie, ever doubting the Hobbit till the last moment.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Radagast the brown is an unnecessarry addition, his character is a clown , totally unnecessary to make him a clown covered in bird crap. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Its about Honor &amp; Pride one second and then its a joke another scene, big mismatch. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>GANDALF uses a MOTH AGAIN to call the eagle clan (reference to LOTR), in the book he doesn't.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Overall the movie tries too hard to be LOTR, when its NOT LOTR. </li></ul><br/><br/>I do wish Peter Jackson didn't make the mistakes and decisions that he did, he has let his fans down and he has let himself down. I wish he stayed with his formulae rather than cater to satisfying the mainstream crowd. This is Star wars episode 1 all over again.<br/><br/>I also hope the coming 2 movies are better, if PJ can hear his fan's feedback and remove the modern day humor, use MORE ORIGINAL OST rather than recycle LOTR OST."
"lomaran-1","8","11","26","15 December 2012"," The Hobbit: A Long-Expected Journey (to the theater)
","Dear denizen of IMDb:<br/><br/>If you are reading this, then you want to know what I thought of Peter Jackson's latest offering, The Hobbit. While I can honestly say that I enjoyed it, I may not have enjoyed ALL of it...<br/><br/>What did I find wrong with it? Well, I'll begin with what my family said about it as soon as it was over... it was no Lord of the Rings. And THAT, actually, is the whole problem in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Jackson and team have tried to turn the Hobbit (a very simple tale, all things considered) into an epic the likes of LOTR. Their approach to this involved a) making one 300+ page book into a trilogy, and b) working in pointless back-story designed to tie it all directly into the Lord of the Rings movies. Yes, the Hobbit is the prequel to the LOTR, but it's also its own story: please tell it! Why do we need to see Radagast the Brown, a high council meeting in Rivendell, and talk of Sauron and Morgul blades, when we came here to see the quest of Erebor? There are also sub-plots involving Azog ""the Pale Orc"" and his hunt for Thorin, and Elrond's disapproval of the Dwarfs' quest to reclaim their home. If you're a Tolkien aficionado, this'll likely give you a heart attack. But ignoring the fact that most of this isn't at all accurate to ANY of Tolkien's works, let alone the Hobbit, it's all a serious strain on the movie's pace. It takes for-flipping-ever to get as far as the Trolls: even I, who have watched the entire extended edition of the LOTR trilogy not once, but THRICE through, started to feel a bit bored. All of this is obviously padding to help justify the next two films, but for now all it does is bring this film's pace to an utter halt.<br/><br/>Then there's the little things: the endless nitpicks. For example, Thorin holds the Elves a major grudge in the film - not sure if THIS was in the book, but my memory may be rusty. Anyway, throughout the film Gandalf attempts to help Thorin overcome this grudge, and logically we the audience should be rooting for Gandalf to prevail. However, for some reason, Elrond does not approve of the Dwarfs' quest, and would have stopped it had they not crept away when he wasn't looking. Who is he to forbid the Dwarfs from taking back their home, especially while he's safe and snug in his? Thorin's dislike of Elves, all in all, does not seem totally irrational.<br/><br/>""Confusticate and be-bother"" the lack of singing! Having grown up with the Rankin/Bass Hobbit, which included MANY of Tolkien's songs, I was dying to hear them in this. I knew from the trailer that ""Misty Mountains Cold"" was here; the film manages to add ""Chip the Glasses, Crack the Plates."" But that's all! Heck, more songs would've made great padding! How about a round of ""Down, Down to Goblin-Town"" from the Orcs of the mountain? No such luck. It's Azog himself that chases the Dwarfs into the trees; don't expect HIM to break into ""Fifteen Birds"" any time soon.<br/><br/>There's plenty more I can nitpick: Bilbo stalling the Trolls instead of Gandalf; the Hobbit leaving home of his own will when the Wizard actually forced him to. But that's enough, I think. After all, I gave this film an 8. After all this negativity, why did I like it? Well, for all that was done wrong, there was plenty that was done right, and it helped make the overall experience enjoyable. Bilbo himself, for instance, was great. Martin Freeman looks a lot like a young Ian Holm, and his performance as a homebody taken WAY out of his comfort zone was spot on. I sympathized with him, so much so that I gladly forgave the blatant changes the director made from the book, both during and after the party scene.<br/><br/>The Dwarfs are likable - although several of them aren't quite Dwarfish enough (Thorin could have used a prosthetic nose, while Fili and Kili were clearly human). Still, they're a fine group to have an adventure with, and while they may be goofy, they never cross the line. The closest thing to an actual line-crossing is Radagast, who, despite seeming out of place, was certainly no Jar Jar Binks.<br/><br/>I thought Gollum's scene was handled very well. His split personality is played to great effect, and the director manages to mix legitimate tension with welcome comedy (I loved Gollum's very business-like delivery of the line ""If Baggins loses, we eats it whole""). And Gandalf's statement from FOTR about the pity Bilbo felt toward Gollum makes sense, as we ourselves feel pity when seeing this wretched creature weep for his lost Ring.<br/><br/>The overall feel of Middle-Earth is still here... mostly. Hobbiton and Rivendell haven't changed, and I thought Erebor was magnificent, full of Dwarven pride and glory. On the other hand, Dale looked like something out of Narnia, not Middle-Earth, while Radagast's house would not seem out of place in Wonderland. Hmm.<br/><br/>There's a duel between Azog and Thorin toward the end. Obviously, this was not in the book, and therefore a turn-off at first, but after seeing Bilbo stand up to Azog on Thorin's behalf, and more importantly, Thorin's reaction to this, I'm forgiving. The aftermath is actually touching... kudos!<br/><br/>The film ends with a teasing glimpse of Smaug's eye. I expected as much, but I did NOT expect to be quite so anxious for more. Purists will complain, as have I, but despite my gripes, I'm no less excited for the journey to continue (though I honestly don't see how they could conjure TWO more films from what's left). I'd recommend this, as a Tolkien and Jackson fan."

","I'm probably too traditional and old fashioned for my own good. I'm pretty close to senior citizen status, so 3D and this new fangled 48 frames per second business isn't something that whets my appetite enough to make me veer from watching films in a conventional format. Additionally, it's been some time since I've read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so my memory is a little hazy about events in the first book.<br/><br/>With all of that stated, I'd have to say I was somewhat underwhelmed by this Unexpected Journey. The first half hour or so that was spent introducing the dwarfs seemed way too long, and even though I felt I was being attentive enough, I only managed to catch about half the names of the characters. Even as the story progressed, I never had a good sense of who the players were except for leader Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the brothers Fili and Kili. It was a bit disorienting as well to picture them all as dwarfs when they looked normal size except when in the company of Gandalf and the elven folk. The scene in Rivendale was the only one where you got that sense of proportion.<br/><br/>I found interesting the comments of viewers who felt this film wasn't as dark as the Lord of The Rings series. A significant portion of the picture takes place underground, in caves, and at night, so I don't find that analysis particularly accurate. If anything, the battle scenes are virtually non stop from one to the next, so there's always a pervasive element of danger. In that regard, given the fierce intensity of each encounter with orcs, wargs and goblins, I found it just too unbelievable that no one among the dozen plus adventurers wound up with not even a scratch. Consider the escape in the goblin cave and the way that chase ended with the plummeting wooden bridge and all the dwarfs holding on for dear life. No one even needed to catch their breath.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I thought the geography was stunningly photographed, the New Zealand setting a remarkably perfect depiction of Tolkien's graphic descriptions. As before, the returning actors did a splendid job, and I find it amazing how Ian McKellan at seventy three and Christopher Lee at eighty manage to keep pace with the rest of the cast. And speaking of age, Hugo Weaving as Elrond and Cate Blanchett as Lady Galadriel don't look any older than they did almost a decade ago in LOTR, so maybe there's something to that elven longevity business.<br/><br/>Finally, special consideration needs to be given to the meeting of Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Gollum (Andy Serkis). My recollection of the book suggests that this sequence was done quite accurately, particularly in regard to the riddles posed by each of the characters. Gollum seemed much more menacing here than he did in LOTR, and he along with some of the other fierce looking creatures in the story hardly makes for a recommended viewing for young kids.<br/><br/>So anyway, even with my criticisms, what I'll probably do is see this again, but break down and go for the 3D, and then firmly anticipate the remaining installments in the trilogy. Like other reviewers, I have some reservations about the need to go that distance as well, but I'll give Peter Jackson the benefit of the doubt. If I'm feeling up to it, I'll go back and read the book again too."
"davidbratt","8","12","29","20 December 2012"," The Hobbit: a mixed bag of good and bad!
","Its finally here people, after 9 years of re-watching the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy over and over again Peter Jackson returns us to Middle Earth in ""The Hobbit: An unexpected Journey"". <br/><br/>With that being said, my expectations, and the expectations of the world were beyond high and as I sat down in the Sheffield IMAX theatre to pull on my 3D glasses, I was hoping to be blown away. Unfortunately, (and I can't believe I am saying this) after nearly 3 hours, Peter Jackson's return to the world of Tolkien seems rather weak and left me feeling a tad disappointed, but only a tad. Don't get me wrong the film is great and some of the critics slating it need to do one, but in Jacksons attempt to recreate the style of the original films he falls short in some key areas where the LOTR triumphed, and unfortunately the prequels will always be compared to Jacksons LOTR legacy. <br/><br/>Lets start with the biggest debate amongst critics, Jacksons ""obsession"" with a higher frame rate. This winter, audiences will not only have the choice to see The Hobbit, they'll have the choice to see it in 2D, 3D, or in IMAX 3D at 48 frames-per-second, a speed twice as fast as conventional projection that promises a clearer, more lifelike and sharper image. This is the first time in cinema history that a film has been produced in 48fps and if you can, go and see it in IMAX for this reason.<br/><br/>At first I was against the idea of such a small book being made into a trilogy. I think I still am, which is strange as when it came to the LOTR I longed for 3-hour films and deleted scenes tossed on the cutting room floor to be added to a 5 hour long special edition, but when it comes ""The Hobbit"", 2 films would definitely have done it justice. By making it into a trilogy I worry quality is being compromised for money's sake, as Peter Jackson doesn't cut The Hobbit, he adds to it with nonsense fan plugs borrowing from LOTR, The Silmarillion, and who knows what else to pointless effect. <br/><br/>For instance, Radagast's involvement is pointless and his bunny sled is ridiculous.. We also get to see Saruman and Galadriel in a boring scene that has absolutely no relevance to the main narrative. Wait, what exactly is ""The Hobbit"" about again? Apparently Jackson is trying to make connections with LOTR, but ""Fellowship of the Ring"" already explains past events pretty well. Seriously, all the LOTR fanboy pleasing scenes could have been left out (including Frodo). But no, we need them in order to have enough material for the trilogy, which is what disappointed me about the film. <br/><br/>The bizarre, unfunny, slapstick humor is my last negative about the film. This involves snot jokes, burping, poop hair, and lame one-liners. Most people are saying ""well it's based on a children's book"", but this is Tolkien's middle earth not an episode of Miranda. Sure, the source material was written for children but I'm talking about the movie. Adding all this stupid humor really messes with the tone; it doesn't feel like it belongs in the LOTR universe that ""The Hobbit"" is trying hard replicate. The film will go from trying to be epic to pathetic gags.<br/><br/>One of the things that amazed me with the original LOTR films was the fight scenes, how well they were choreographed, and the pace and intensity of the action, the attention to detail, from blood splattered orcs to the scratches and dents in a Gondor chestplate. However, in ""The Hobbit"", unfortunately this is not the case. Even though the action scenes are stylish and clever, they have been dubbed down, rather than the intense action of the other LOTR films we get pushing, shoving and and slow motion fight scenes that left me wondering is I had missed something. Whether or not this was done to ensure the film received a 12A rating rather than something higher and therefore widening the audience and therefore the prospective profits is beyond me but any of the fight scenes from Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers or The Return of the King would trounce all over all of those from The Hobbit combined.<br/><br/>The best scene in the film BY FAR is the interaction between Bilbo and Gollum. As usual, Andy Serkis steals the show with his Gollum/Smeagol split personality, (someone give that man an Oscar) and Martin Freeman really shows us why Jackson chose him as his Hobbit hero! The finding of the Ring is also significant and is really the only scene that should have any connection with LOTR unlike Galadriel, Frodo, etc. <br/><br/>Having spent the last few paragraphs being a bit negative and picking on every detail that strikes me as a flaw I will say that I did love this film and it had many merits, the casting of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is perfect, Andy Serkis yet again delivers an outstanding performance as Gollum and Ian Mckellan is every inch the aged but powerful wizard he always was. Also I will say that the film does get better and better as you go through, whether this is due to the fact that for the first 45 minutes of the film you don't once venture outside of Bilbo's home or whether it's due to the audience adjusting to the effects that the new cameras bring, or perhaps a mix of both I don't know but I can say that, despite the impressions that you may have gained from the negativity of this review so far, it was a great film, just in my view it will never be anywhere near as good as the first three LOTR films, and Jacksons attempt to replicate them so far hasn't worked. <br/><br/>Overall rating 7/10."
"hilary-54","4","6","12","13 January 2013"," Not all that good
","The Hobbit is a really good story, but what is it about a director who cannot even get the rhetoric of storytelling right, when the material is there already in the book. This is a real pity. Most of the story takes place on the road, but it felt more as if battles took up the bulk of it.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film, was battle scene after battle scene, with audio so deafening, that despite the fact I blocked my ears with my hands through most of the film, my ears were ringing all that evening. I felt like suing the cinema and film company for aural damage.<br/><br/>All the battle scenes were the same intensity. In the book, a little altercation with Orcs became a major scene, and these were reworked ad infinitum. So many things were missing from the actual story, for instance, the spiders lair. The Golem scenes were good, but there should have been subtitles for the riddle sequence, as sometimes the speech was so indistinct with all the hissing and spluttering.<br/><br/>The scenes looked much more artificial than in the Lord of the Rings series, and the matte painting of Rivendell really looked flat. I noted that there was no expense spared in the making of this film. How much more difficult would it have been (and perhaps even cheaper) to go for less of the effects and more of the atmosphere the original story conveyed.<br/><br/>The music was top notch, and the theme was lovely, including the folkish song which was really ingenuous. Also excellent, was the dwarfs plainchant in the beginning. Well done composers, choristers and musicians."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","22","61","26 December 2012"," I personally thought it was a very good film, but I do understand the complaints
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was the most anticipated movie of the year in our family. I for one admire many of the actors in the cast, and I love the Lord of the Rings films and Tolkein's writing. The Hobbit as a book is great, an exciting and very well-written one with identifiable character, though the story is noticeably more slight than Lord of the Rings. Seeing it in the cinema as a whole family and with friends, every single one of us left the film with smiles on our faces, expectations met. As of now, I still think The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very good film in many ways, but I do understand some of the complaints directed towards it(well apart from the unnecessary vitriol on both sides).<br/><br/>Of the complaints, there are those that I agree with. I do think the film is too long, as was the introduction of the dwarfs(around 20-30 minutes when it could have easily been half of that). People have picked up on the dangerous parts not looking dangerous enough, considering what happens to them it was odd to see everybody coming out of those scenes unscathed. As well as some of the dwarfs not having enough development and coming and going, which is also valid( their personalities really shine this said), hopefully the next two films will rectify this. And I also agree that Azog is a very one-dimensional character, whose purpose seemed to be to give further conflict and some kind of character development for Thorin. Understandable, but I don't think it was needed as such.<br/><br/>There are also a couple that I can understand, but personally don't agree with. The ending was abrupt yes, but instead of having a that's it? feel it did leave me highly anticipating the next instalment. The pacing has often been criticised as plodding, I thought the pacing did match the pacing of the Lord of the Rings films very well, it probably feels plodding because it doesn't have as much going on.<br/><br/>A couple of assets I was mixed on too. On the most part, I thought the special effects were great. The eagles, stone giants and the trolls really stood out, but Gollum as in Lord of the Rings was the masterstroke. The two exceptions were Azog, who looks more at home in a horror movie, and the Goblin King, reminiscent of a small-ish head on a huge body, it did look rather ridiculous to me. The screenplay did have moments where it was juvenile(like in the dinner scene in Rivendell) and clichéd(Thorin being angry at Bilbo for his intervention then being accepting of him), but there were spots where it was also humorous like with Bilbo and Gandalf and thought-provoking like the Council scene at Rivendell.<br/><br/>Everything else though I cannot fault. It looks fantastic visually. The cinematography positively sweeps and some of the most stunningly epic scenery I've ever seen is in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. In style and look, it is true to the Lord of the Rings films I feel. I also love Howard Shore's music. It brought so much soul to the Lord of the Rings films, and it is the same here. It has been criticised for being a re-hash, and I'll be honest here and say if there is one complaint for this film that I don't agree with it's this. It still is hauntingly-beautiful, and while there are some recognisable nods it really is a wonderfully orchestrated and atmospheric score. Misty Mountains is a wonderful song too.<br/><br/>Initially I was worried about the story being too padded out, considering it being three 2 1/2- 3 hour adaptations of a 300-or so page book. Many people did, I didn't see it too much of one personally. While the introduction of the dwarfs was overlong and the battle between the dwarfs and Azog was the least effective set-piece, I loved the story-book nature of the prologue and the Hobbiton scenes had a lot of warmth and nostalgia. As with Lord of the Rings, many of the set pieces are extraordinary, the stone giants and the eagles were very well done, the troll scene was amusing and the goblin scene did have a lot of very impressive scope complete with some very efficiently choreographed action. But the highlight of the film was the encounter between Bilbo and Gollum, funny, terrifying and moving all at once.<br/><br/>Looking at the cast on paper, you'd think immediately that this is a strong cast. On film it is exactly the same. Martin Freeman plays Bilbo with a lot of curmudgeonly charm- Ian Holm is similarly excellent as his older self-, while Ian McKellen is perfectly cast as Gandalf, knowing and wise with a bit of subtle humour about him. You'd think that Richard Armitage's Thorin is a bit of typecasting, his performance here makes you not mind that too much, as mean and brooding is what Armitage does best and it suits Thorin to a tee. Of the dwarfs the most well-developed are Balin and Bofur, and they are very well played by Ken Stott and James Nesbitt, actors I do respect and have liked a lot of their projects.<br/><br/>Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchett are also to be seen as Sarouman and Galadriel and they do typically fine jobs, and I will say the same for the Elrond of Hugo Weaving. Randagast is a fun additional character, and played amusingly by Sylvester McCoy, while Barry Humphries seems to be having fun with the Goblin King. Though if there was an award for the film's best performance, I'd without hesitation give it to Andy Serkis. It is an incredibly vivid performance, full of humour, intensity and pathos, a large part of why his encounter with Bilbo was the film's highlight.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good film that could've been even better. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"LemonLadyR","1","4","7","26 May 2016"," Oh, PJ, What Have You Done?
","I just finished watching Peter Jackson, the director (in case you've been under a rock for 15 yrs), say, in the special features of The Hobbit:AUJ, that he really didn't want to copy, emulate, retread, or even direct this movie (and felt STRONGLY about not directing it (so what are we to expect then?), but due to a Tolkien estate rights problem it took way too long to get green lighted, so that the director that was hired, Guillermo del Toro, had to move on, but I would have oh so loved to have seen his take on it as it couldn't be any worse, certainly).<br/><br/>OK, so know that PJ's heart was not in directing this. Great idea to have someone else direct it and PJ & Co. could still write and produce it. He still could have hired another director, when del Toro had to leave, but pre-production had gotten too far along to bring someone else in. So, there were all these other considerations weighing it down, right off the bat, that LOTR didn't have. There was a nice innocence to LOTR, esp the first one. There was no urgency to make another 'Avatar' back then (which PJ's effects company, Weta Workshop, worked on), and no one knew that LOTR could even be done. Plus a lot of old school techniques were used, and that became an echo in the those films which was appropriate. Tolkien would have never wanted things to diverge so completely into the high tech world of The Hobbit! So of course MGM was pressuring for a repeat and I understand that, to a *certain* degree. PJ seemed to be able to deal with that in LOTR and naturally come out on the other side with 3 very watchable movies (well, the extended versions, anyway; I never really 'got' the success of the theatricals nor did I even see them all, preferring to wait for the extended versions).<br/><br/>As far as this film goes, and by now, all 3 have come out... First, I should say that I have been a rabid Tolkien fan since the 60s when it was required reading in elementary school. So my first thought on hearing there were to be 3 movies made from a small children's book (although we adults certainly read and enjoy it) was that PJ must have been kidding. Right there it took the turn of being all about the money. Let's take this book that 100 million people have read for generations, which is a reference point for so many people, and bloat it up out of all reason. One reviewer said that you could do that for an obscure novel, but this is canonical Tolkien, and I very much agree. Plus, IMO, I don't think The Hobbit, as a novel, stands up well to LOTR, and it was never meant to; it was a doddle of sorts while grading papers, for his kids, and is endearing and adventurous but not of an epic nature, nor a good foundation for a big movie. LOTR and what became The Silmarrion were Tolkien's magnum opus pieces.<br/><br/>Thus, PJ, to make a blockbuster out of it, had to really prostitute himself in this case, and throw the mostly loving care he had for LOTR out and *use* The Hobbit to his and MGM's ends, which is a bit unforgivable. It tries to be an action/fantasy movie, which is a tough balance that he got pretty right on LOTR, but this one strays so far from the book and the whole theme is just 'big, big, big' (the crew even says that is what he told them was the main theme and it is not even a BIG book!). It is also very hard to make people care about 13+ characters (mostly new) in a movie, no matter how long. Esp Dwarfs. I didn't find them esp compelling or attractive, just cartoonish, with all apologies to the actors who were doing the best they could with the material and silly costumes.<br/><br/>Then there is the heavy weight of LOTR, with the same scenes/plots from LOTR, which he said he would NOT do, so it is all the worse knowing that. The pacing is terrible, I think I could do a better job. Sometimes *nothing* is going on. Action sequences are way too long with nothing new going on. This from the director of the 2 epic battles from LOTR, which are hands down the best battle sequences I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I really could not get through these movies, and oh how I tried, but I was just bored and then angry when seeing scenes ripped off 100% from LOTR or gratuitous stuff. There *are* LOTR characters in The Hobbit but PJ got carried away. In trying to make it work as well as LOTR, he got trapped into using that reference way too much and using retread material. <br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn in LOTR) said, re LOTR, that the success was much like The One Ring, which started taking over the project, and the movies became more about awards and the hoopla, thus diminishing the heart of them. And The Hobbit suffers from this many times over. If PJ wanted to depart so much from the book, he should based it on Middle Earth legend/culture and not called it ""The Hobbit"".<br/><br/>I say all this with as much respect as I can for the actors and crew who worked, obviously, very hard on this movie and put their hearts into it. And I started to give it two or three stars for that, but in the end, the rating is for the film as a whole, so no ""A"" for effort.<br/><br/>This film and the sequels are a travesty of the highest order. PJ ripped off Tolkien's name and book for this movie, plain and simple. Grrrrrrr."
"japamo","8","4","7","6 March 2014"," Except for two or three ""Lord of the Rings"" Detours, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" Stays Rousingly and Faithfully on Cours
","I know this sounds weird, but have you ever refused to watch a movie because you haven't read the book or play that inspired it, and therefore don't feel ""ready"" to see it? For example, that's why (with the exception of ""The Sorceror's Stone"") I never saw the Harry Potter octology (eight films) based on J.K. Rowling's seven novels. How could my movie impressions compare with those who have immersed themselves in both the Harry Potter book AND movie mythos? Ditto with J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings (LotR)"" novel trilogy and Peter Jackson's movie trilogy based on it: I haven't done the LotR ""reading homework"" (yet, but I'd like to someday), so how can I presume to watch and fully appreciate and understand the LotR movies? I wasn't worthy, I wasn't worthy.<br/><br/>Then Peter Jackson announced many moons ago that he planned a movie adaptation of Tolkien's unofficial LotR prequel, the beloved, durable classic ""The Hobbit"", and I subsequently became excited. I HAD read ""The Hobbit"" and even critiqued it on Amazon.com, and so felt prepared to watch ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (hereafter ""Hobbit: AUJ"") and even compare and contrast it with the novel, and discuss it with its numerous fans. Then, I found out ""Hobbit: AUJ"" would incorporate origins of events (such as the White Council and the rise of the Necromancer) only barely alluded to in ""The Hobbit"" novel but more fully fleshed out in the ""LotR"" movie trilogy. Furthermore, Jackson planned an epic 9-hour movie trilogy. My enthusiasm wavered. I was starting to doubt I was prepared to watch THIS trilogy either, because I thought it would be altered, attenuated, and mixed up beyond recognition. Therefore, I missed ""Hobbit:AUJ"" in the theatres.<br/><br/>Recently, however, ""Hobbit: AUJ"" popped up on HBO, and I finally resolved to devote the time to seeing it. So, especially to those people who have read only ""The Hobbit"", and even those who have read the unannotated, un-appendixed version, I can state with relief and happy surprise that ""Hobbit: AUJ"" remains largely and divertingly faithful to the roughly first 50% of the novel it covers. It covers the various set-pieces (e.g. Gandalf's (Sir Ian McKellen) recruitment of the reluctant Bilbo for a territory-reclaiming and burgling adventure, the dwarfs' boisterous visit to Bilbo's hobbit-hole, the encounter with the dull-witted trolls) with vigor, boisterous humor, and exquisitely rendered CGI action. Even the preliminary explanation for the dwarfs' exile from their Erebor home by the barely glimpsed but still astounding dragon Smaug (though not explicitly in the novel) efficiently and rousingly sets up the hobbit's adventure. Yes, there are the lengthy LotR detours such as the wild-eyed, slovenly wood wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) only mentioned once by Beorn in the unannotated Hobbit) discovering the spiders and other evil forces of the Necromancer massing and the White Council including Gandalf, Elrond the Elvenking (Hugo Weaving), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) contemplating the Necromancers rise. However, I did not find them all that distracting, and perhaps even a little bit useful if I ever tackle both book and movie ""LotR"".<br/><br/>In general, no movie can be slavishly faithful to its literary source since they are two distinct mediums with distinct advantages and disadvantages. ""The Hobbit: AUJ"" is certainly no exception. A movie CAN take dramatic license with a book's plot and characters provided it doesn't deviate too much from its spirit. I think ""The Hobbit: AUJ"" largely succeeds in doing this. I felt one of the main themes of ""The Hobbit"" novel is that no matter how small, timid, and uncertain you are, you can have the traits and courage to accomplish great things. In ""The Hobbit: AUJ"", the younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) expresses that theme very well, and even improves upon it.<br/><br/>In the novel, many people might feel that Bilbo was too much of a reluctant hero, too whiny and complaining. Remember in the novel when he practically curled into a quivering fetal position when Gandalf and the dwarfs explain the danger of their quest? In the movie, Bilbo merely comically faints. Furthermore, in the movie Freeman's Bilbo is more refreshingly and amusingly persnickety, fussy, and indignant than in the novel and shows his slowly receding unwillingness to go on the journey more admirably. Still, some ""Hobbit' novel purists may balk at Bilbo's ""uncharacteristic"" slaying of a charging orc (also not in the novel) to save Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage). It didn't bother me, because I saw it as the first, spontaneous manifestation of Bilbo's growing Tookish resolve. An even better and touching illustration of Bilbo's resolve comes toward the end of the movie, after the eagles have rescued Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarfs from being besieged in fir trees by the hideous, slavering orcs and their wolf-mounts, the Wargs. Bilbo, a complacent bourgeois home-owner, pities the dwarfs' nomadic homelessness and vows to help them reclaim their mountain home from the dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, if, like me, you have read an unadorned copy of ""The Hobbit"", you needn't fear that ""The Hobbit: AUJ"" has mangled and twisted the tale into an unknown shape. It hasn't, and unless you are fastidious and nitpicky, you may enjoy some of Jackson's flourishes (such as the grotesque but eloquent Goblin King's (Barry Humphries's) ""fat"" beard and his teeming underground kingdom) and still rest assured that ""The Hobbit: AUJ"" has mostly respected Tolkien's tale – at least so far.<br/><br/>Anyway, I now feel worthy and ready to see ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" in the theatre. If nothing else, I think I will enjoy seeing Smaug the Tremendous, the Magnificent, and the Stupendous!"

","I am a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings series of films, and no matter how many times I watch them I am always astounded by the amount of detail and story and how gripping each individual film is for the length. The Hobbit, unfortunately does not follow this trend at all. I thought I should finally get around to watching this film after missing it in the cinema and being particularly jealous of hearing the rave reviews.<br/><br/>How this film got above a 6 is beyond me. Nothing happens at all. Once I'd watched it I had to look back and remind myself how long the film was... and whether I had missed an important part somewhere, the whole film could fit into a 30 minute introduction to a more gripping and fitting story line. <br/><br/>I would pick out particular bits that where a complete waste of time (i.e. the rocks fighting, the slapstick trolls) but really.... I can't think of anything that was worth watching. Despite the length of the film, and the little amount of information portrayed, you would believe that the epic journey they were undertaking was a trip to the corner shop as they quickly teleport from one part of earth to another with little issue."
"Uriah43","5","4","7","29 December 2013"," Filler Material
","As anybody who has read the book knows ""the Hobbit"" was intended to be pure ""fantasy"" with a little ""adventure"" thrown in for good measure. And when compared with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy it was the shortest book of them all. So it came as a big surprise to me when I learned that ""the Hobbit"" was being made into 3 separate movies. Begging the question: Was this being done to capture the essence of the book or was this simply a scheme to make more money? Well, having just watched this movie I can honestly say that this isn't about capturing art for art's sake-it's about making money. So much so that the producer took a portion of the""fantasy and adventure"" from the book and basically used ""CGI and action"" as filler material. After all, he's got two more movies to make. Now, to be fair the other ""Lord of the Rings"" films had more than their fair share of CGI and action too. But they managed to incorporate the splendor of the fantasy to a certain degree. This movie has CGI and action. And I have no doubt the next two films will have more of the same. But it should have been much better. As such I rate this movie as only average."
"norden_dammgatan","5","4","7","10 October 2013"," Like butter scraped over too much bread
","Let me point out that I really wanted to like this movie. I am a big fan of the LotR movie trilogy and of Tolkiens books in general, but my disappointment with this movie does not come from the fact that it is different from the book.<br/><br/>I've tried watching this movie several times, after I first saw it in theaters, and each time I barely make it past the introduction. It is not because I feel that it goes too slowly, in fact I rather like ""slow movies"", the problem I have with it is the lack of content it brings.<br/><br/>The book was a pretty short book and this is very evident in this, the first of three (!) movies based on it. Every scene is stretched out to its limit. An example might be the almost 25 minutes we spend watching dwarfs invade poor Bilbos home at the start of the film. Most of this time is spent on eating, bad jokes, juggling plates and telling the story that we already saw in the introduction. Perhaps that story could have been told there instead of at the introduction, but then the introduction would not have been as good. Or maybe much of this scene, along with the backgrounds of the different dwarfs, could have been told during the traveling scenes instead.<br/><br/>Then we have the effects, lovely as they might be, it feels like they made scenes and shots so that they could show off the effects. Not so that the effects could help show the story. Examples are: how much time can you spend running across bridges in the goblin caves or holding on to a cliff while the cliff fights other cliffs. The mountain giant scene is not even referred to later in the movie. It was there purely to show off effects.<br/><br/>But all that aside what really brings this movie down for me is how very blunt it is. Almost all of the jokes are along the lines of: Oh the fat guy is heavy or the silly wizard is silly. There is almost no point where you wonder over the motivation of someone or why things happen the way they do. It is as if there is no trust that the audience can figure things out on their own, everything is presented like a wiki-page. Where there is no mystique how can there be anticipation and interest for what is to come? <br/><br/>My favorite scene in the movie is not even in the book. It is the council at Rivendell. It brings so much information up about what is going on in middle earth. It gives the movie a place in the greater scheme of things. And all the time Sauroman sits there pretending to be a good guy. That scene is so very good, it shows what this movie could have been like."

","I love JRR Tolkien. His works are incredible, and through the various posthumous releases, a world has been created that is simply epic. The Hobbit is a children's book (a phenomenal children's book) that is situated in this world. So much happens within the storyline of the book that is never mentioned. I think that the story has received a very necessary extension from the humble beginnings of the book. Everything that happened within the first 100 or so pages of the Hobbit was shown in this film, and the extensions were largely taken from the appendices of LOTR. I have seen a lot of people complain about the addition of Azog to the story, he is already well established in Middle Earth history, and although there have been changes to his story from the appendices, it is ultimately his (or his son's) army that acts in the battle of the 5 armies in the end of the book. It seems to me that people who are overly critical of this film know just enough about the Hobbit to know that there is extra material being used, but not enough to know that the majority of this is part of the Tolkien mythology, hence all the complaints. Even on the most basic level, the book to film transition needed more description and action, since most of this is never actually described in the book (Bilbo gets knocked out at the start of the battle and wakes up when it is over). A direct book to film change would have been no where near as exciting, which a film has to require, or people won't watch it!<br/><br/>I loved this film, and I think that PJ has done an amazing job, and I can't wait to see what he will do with the next two."
"animeartandasia","4","4","7","5 September 2013"," Didn't Care Too Much
","*Contains Spoilers* The film, of course in personal opinion, was too lengthy and dry. Then action, when it happened, was too quick paced and under-choreographed. Additionally the film had (in some places) over animated graphics which looked very phony and ruined any chance at realistic graphics that the movie had. Then when picked up by the giant birds, it is easily noticed how horrid the feather texture was. (In 3D animation, a texture is the image applied to the surface of an object.) Then at the ending of the movie it cuts out the battle with Smaug, only for making a sequel, which should have been just put in this movie with less of the dry pointless time consumed in the beginning. To tell the truth, if I had watched it in theaters when it first came out, I would have demanded a refund for my ticket because of the ending. But the cinematography, besides plot and digital graphics, was rather good. Just for that it has 4 stars. BUT NO MORE."
"Godfather-1990","7","7","15","13 January 2013"," A flawed journey, but quiet charming and entertaining nonetheless
","This is one of the movies that you either enjoy as a whole and try to overlook the negatives, or you be put off by its flaws, luckily .. I was among the first group.<br/><br/>We have to remember that this is a first installment of a series and not a complete story by its own, so the upcoming two films may have a positive or a negative effect on it.<br/><br/>That being said, let me start addressing what I liked and disliked about the movie. The introduction to the characters was very well done, the movie manages to flesh out the characters despite having too many of them, they are all likable and none of them feels annoying or unnecessary. The story is well built, I loved how they underlined some of the themes like finding what it takes to leave your daily life and do the unusual and the grief of being homeless.<br/><br/>The acting was magnificent, all the actors were perfectly fitting for their roles. The scenery and colors were so beautiful and Howard Shore's score was great.<br/><br/>My biggest issue was with the pacing, at least half an hour could have been cut out, especially some of scenes played solely for humor, I am very annoyed by this mainly because Peter Jackson has repeated the same mistake he made with king kong, but all that can be forgiven in return for many parts of sheer brilliance.<br/><br/>So is it perfect? No. Is it on par with The Lord of the Rings movies? No. But this remains a very well made film that succeeds at being entertaining, heart warming and magical and it's definitely a very welcome return to middle earth."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","7","15","11 January 2013"," It's overlong, but it's still true to the spirit of what made Middle Earth so enchanting in the first place.
","It's been nine years since Peter Jackson ended his epic retelling of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga, which in its lifetime garnered billions of dollars in worldwide gross, and won a combined total of 17 Academy Awards, including Best Picture for Return of the King. The whole trilogy is a collective success that is one of the few cinematic achievements that I would ever consider as perfect. Flash forward to the present day, and we now take a trip back to Middle Earth with The Hobbit, the prequel to the trilogy. Originally slated to be split into two sections and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, Jackson later took the helm, and decided to split the book into a trilogy like that of The Lord of the Rings. While this may sound quite excessive, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey mostly justifies the viewing experience. Mostly...<br/><br/>Set sixty years prior to The Fellowship of the Ring, An Unexpected Journey sees a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, excellently filling the shoes of Ian Holm) in his life in the Shire. He is approached by the grey wizard Gandalf (Played once more by the terrific Ian McKellen) on aiding him and a band of thirteen dwarfs on a quest to their home on the lonely mountain, where they plan to reclaim it from the treasure obsessed dragon Smaug. Bilbo is understandably apprehensive to go on the perilous travel, but the adventurous spirit proves too hard to resist, and the band of fifteen begin their long journey. Only took 'em forty minutes to get to that point.<br/><br/>I can certainly echo the sentiment that this movie is excessive in both its content and length, clocking in at about 2 hours and 45 minutes. In the movie's defense, I can't recall a single moment where I was ever bored. Sure, the overload of material does keep the movie from reaching the massive heights of its predecessor, but this is a project that deserves to be judged on its own strengths rather than those based on comparison. The movie still stays true to the spirit of what made Middle Earth such an engrossing world in the first place. Those who criticize the movie for being a bit more weighty in tone than it needs to be may have a point, but I think that helps in keeping consistency with the tones of the previous films.<br/><br/>If one thing can be made sure of, Jackson clearly hasn't lost a step when it comes to visual splendor. He rallies together the same talented craft crew that he worked with before, including DP Andrew Lesnie, Production Designer Dan Hennah, Makeup Designer Richard Taylor, Composer Howard Shore, and Visual Effects Supervisor Joe Letteri. All of these people perform their work to the highest caliber possible, hardly ever missing a beat during the epic set pieces, dazzling environments and towns, and the sweeping views of the terrain. Nine years later, and Middle Earth is still as enchanting as it ever was.<br/><br/>I haven't even gotten into the talent that goes in front of the camera. I've already mentioned how good Freeman and McKellen are. The Dwarfs are all quite entertaining, some more than others, even though they mostly blend together. If you're looking for some more veteran cast members besides McKellen, you'll find them as well, including the likes of Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Hugo Weaving. Even Gollum, played to perfection once more by Andy Serkis, gets to make an appearance. What more can I say about him that hasn't already been said. He shows up in what is without doubt the best scene in the whole movie. A sequence where he and Bilbo engage in a high stakes game of riddles, all set within the dimly lit catacombs of his lair. The foreboding sound and creepy imagery all work wonderfully in raising the tension of the situation.<br/><br/>Not everyone will enjoy The Hobbit, however. It asks a lot of patience, perhaps more than it should be, and I feel that something with a slightly simpler script and trimmed running time would have allowed it to be the amazing prequel it deserved to be. Judging it by what it is, though, there wasn't much detriment to my enjoyment of this movie. Besides, it's unfair to judge only a portion of a full movie, much in the same way of the original Lord of the Rings films. I'll gladly tune in to the next two chapters yet to be released.<br/><br/>**** / *****"
"andersmartini2-521-944843","2","7","15","5 January 2013"," biggest disappointment in a Long Time!
","Before watching the hobbit, I had read a few reviews of it, mainly here on IMDb, saying its very accurate to the book. Sounds wonderful I thought, having loved the book the Hobbit, way more than I liked the others of J.R.R Tolkien.<br/><br/>Now the people saying this was closely based on the book, did you guys see the same film that I saw? I think I counted somewhere around 7-8 quite clear references to events in the book, however the events in the film can not be said to have been based on the ones in the book, they hinted at them at best.<br/><br/>The storyline was reduced to a quite impressive amount of excuses to add action-scenes. and the characters seem thin, undeveloped. the adventurous feel that needs to be there just wasn't. the music seemed ""glued"" on to the film,instead of that majestic feeling of drama the music is supposed to inspire, I couldn't help imagining the orchestra in a room playing away to a small screen in the corner.<br/><br/>cant say I'm THAT impressed with the acting neither, not that they act badly, the actors just don't get a chance to do their thing between running from orcs and getting eaten by wargs."
"maitre-miyamoto","4","7","15","31 December 2012"," Boring as heck
","After hesitating for a while between Django Unchained and the Hobbit, my wife and I chose to watch the latter. I read many bad reviews but some people also suggested that it was still worth seeing. Since I was quite curious about the high frame rate and that my wife was equally interested in both flicks, we went for the Hobbit. Well, I should have trusted the reviews instead.<br/><br/>This Hobbit is basically a cheap movie with a big budget. Kinda like giving $100 millions to director Uwe Boll. The directing is terrible. I actually doubt whether Peter Jackson directed it himself or if it's mostly the work of some second and third team. We get to see lots of people staring at the horizon trying to convey emotions that are not there (especially Thorin). Many pointless shots of little people wandering in the mountains. Poor dialogs. Boring flashbacks. You name it. It's not even entertaining and accidentally funny like a real Uwe Boll movie. I mean, it's campy but just not campy enough to keep you awake for 3 hours. Many scenes look like those made-for-TV reenactments. Not sure it's just the bad acting; it could be due to the high frame rate that makes things look too real. Basically, we paid $32 only to be bored and disappointed. We are not even going to bother watching the other episodes. I read somewhere that the Hobbit felt like the never ending end of LOTR3. I will have to agree with that.<br/><br/>There might have been two scenes that I kind of found entertaining. The one with Gollum and the escape from the goblin den which almost looked like a cool platform video game.<br/><br/>I never read the book before but the movie definitely didn't make me want to. All I know is that my wife read it when she was young and loves it (the book). Yet, we both felt the same about the movie. It was corny. Kids, die-hard fans of heroic fantasy and people who enjoy CGI might find ways to enjoy it. We didn't."
"blondee3606","2","7","15","28 December 2012"," Not the Hobbit but something kinda sorta
","P Jackson totally missed the flavor of the book. I understand trying to make a movie that meshed with LOTR movies but it very loosely followed the book. Bilbo never demonstrated a reason for wanting to go with the dwarfs in the movie. Gandalf lorded over by Galladriel, Elrond and Sauruman? And what was up with Radagast? I liked the way he was depicted but a sled pulled by rabbits? Riddles in the Dark was very poorly done. And whoever heard of a hollow mountain? I was disappointed that the eagles didn't talk. <br/><br/>On the plus side, the scenery was beautiful and I loved the way Hobbiton was depicted. <br/><br/>On the whole, P Jackson could have followed the book more closely and made the film more palatable and interesting. If you haven't read the book and can overlook the glaring plot holes, silly action scenes, you might like this flick. If you've read the book, be prepared to be disappointed. I'm not a fan of the LOTR movies and I was hoping Jackson could redeem himself with the Hobbit but it wasn't to be."
"vishalsmail33","8","7","15","28 December 2012"," The Hobbit is Captivating enough!
","Be warned,this review contains many spoilers,although i will try not to get too much into details.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings(LOTR),and,as you may have heard,the first movie of a trilogy.(They are making three movies of this one book!)So is this movie in the same league as the LOTR and a fitting adaption of the book?Well,Yes and no.<br/><br/>The dwarfs' city has been demolished and captured by the dragon Smaug. Several years later the wizard Gandalf meets the protagonist the hobbit,Bilbo Baggins and invites him to a journey.Not exactly the adventure type, Bilbo is hesitant.The following night dwarfs arrive one by one at his residence.They make a mess of it and gorge on all the food. Gandalf also returns later and states the purpose of them all being there-To help the thirteen dwarfs under King Thorin to reclaim the lost city beyond the mountains.The next morning the dwarfs are gone and an initially relieved Bilbo finds that he misses the dwarfs' songs and merry making.He decides to join them.<br/><br/>What follows on this unexpected journey is what you might anticipate from a movie of this genre and scale.The group encounter many mythical creatures-Trolls, Orcs,Goblins and stone Golems alike.There is more trouble in the region with a necromancer on the loose.The group also traverse through the city of the elves.<br/><br/>Sounds interesting right?But the pace of the movie can bore you at times,quite unlike LOTR and many a time you feel its a drag.The dialogues are also pretty mediocre.<br/><br/>That apart,the movie does have many high points,especially the animated interaction between Bilbo and Smeagol (Or Gollum,The original owner of the cursed ring).The Hobbit immerses you in Tolkien's world,a world before LOTR happened. I would say watch it for a feel good fantasy experience and some outstanding acting from the cast,especially those playing Gandalf and King Thorin (Bilbo is decent too).The visual effects are amazing,pretty real and even stunning at times.The background score is fine.<br/><br/>Overall verdict:Watch it as a stand alone movie without comparing it to LOTR and you will have a good time."
"mgruebel","6","7","15","25 December 2012"," The Hobbit
","There is a great film within this film. If Peter Jackson comes to his senses, perhaps he will create a ""Shortened Director's Cut"" instead of an ""Extended Edition."" And if not, once the die-hard fans come to their senses and stop hailing it as a 10-star masterpiece, perhaps one of them will re-cut it.<br/><br/>The Good: The 48 fps clarity is beautiful, although viewers accustomed to more ancient material will have to get used to it. Freeman steps into Holm's shoes perfectly, and Serkis, McKellen etc. are excellent at reprising their roles. The goblin king is great fun to watch - his double-chin is a character of its own. Speaking of character. One cannot fault the film for characterizing among the dwarfs only Thorin (Armitage), and to some extent the youngsters Fili and Kili: Tolkien's book does exactly the same! Jackson's photography is sweeping, with the fly-throughs and majestic landscapes viewers have come to expect. All in all, the story hews close to the book, with a few excellent cinematic add-ons: the prelude explaining how the dwarfs lost their home, without revealing the true shape of Smaug the dragon by using the device of a kite; the aside on Gandalf's councils with other elders, implied in the book (and chronicled in the Appendices to LOTR), but not part of Bilbo's limited point of view.<br/><br/>The Bad: the Hobbit is a whimsical adventure tale, not meant to be on the scale of LOTR, and the film loses this flavor entirely with plodding, totally unnecessary, add-on action scenes. Between Trolls and Rivendell, our heroes are gratuitously beset by orcs. Mountain giants (akin to Ents of Stone in the book, but much larger here) fight around them without obvious motivation. The underground cave of the goblins is turned into a contrived roller-coaster ride reminiscent of the disastrous ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" At a crisp 48 fps, elephant-sized goblin kings falling on characters from great height without killing them, or burning trees toppling like dominoes create a video game atmosphere, where the player simply uses his next ""life"" and goes on playing. One of the central rules of Fantasy is flaunted here: that what happens to characters should obey common sense physics and psychology as much as possible, so the reader or viewer can truly believe in the fantasy. It is easy to imagine that a dragon can fly. It is much harder to imagine that an elephant falling straight on you will elicit nothing but a grunt and an annoyed remark.<br/><br/>Cutting about 45 minutes out of this film will turn it into a vibrant 9-star adventure, which lies in waiting just like a statue inside Michelangelo's block of marble.<br/><br/>PS: Like Tolkien's human editor, the IMDb editor does not like dwar-ves"
"bshannon718","9","7","15","15 December 2012"," Don't Let Some of the Critics Deter You, This Is Fantasy at Its Finest
","I found myself reading a number of mixed reviews from a vast array of critics this morning, trying to make some sense of what they were saying. I ultimately came to the conclusion that their complaints were tinged with bias. Granted most of them weren't necessarily bad, but mixed. I will admit that the film does start out somewhat slow, but looking back after experiencing the entire movie, I wouldn't have it any other way. The beginning of the film makes you care about the group as a whole, but more importantly, it makes you care deeply about the key characters: Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. This is not the LOTR, it is an entirely different animal. The Hobbit is more of an adventure than an epic like the LOTR. Once the adventure began, I found myself becoming engulfed in what was coming next, and what new story we would stumble upon. I have read the Hobbit, however I have not read the Silmarillion. Throughout various parts of the film, Jackson incorporates stories from the Silmarillion to expand the universe even more. These took me a little while to get used to, but once again I soon realized how much they added to the story, and how much more they made me care about Thorin, Gandalf, and the entire Dwarven cause. The 48 FPS was absolutely spectacular, it takes movie escapism to a whole new level. I felt as if I was a part of each and every scene, soaking in the beauty of the landscape. Not only was this movie well acted, and well produced, but it was extremely well written. The film delves into ideas, and goes deeper as the film progresses. What really happens in the fight between good and evil, and what truly makes a hero? These questions are asked in this film, and that is the most important part. If a movie simply looks good, and has no substance, it would be a mediocre action flick with no legacy. But, when a film both looks great, sounds great, and FEELS great, then it is art. The Hobbit is art, and I am positive that it will only get better, the Hobbit has not yet been fully realized, but it is on its way, and while it may have its flaws, it has a heart, a brain, and tons of ambition."

"aaron-oneill3","8","7","15","15 December 2012"," At times amazing, at other times lacking the depth of Tolkien's work.
","Having read the book a few times I was quite excited. Having seen the film I was disappointed. The film at times is just incredible, when it follows Tolkien's lead, and disappointing when it strayed from the book, namely for action scenes. 8/10 is an incredible mark, but I expected more.<br/><br/>In the LOTR trilogy Jackson and crew strayed from the books many a time BUT it worked! However there it tended to be the case that they missed stuff out. In the hobbit film they take the scene from Tolkien's work and rewrite it in varying degrees or just invent something completely new. While sometimes this works, other times you wonder why they had to dream up something new.<br/><br/>What annoyed me in order of degree:<br/><br/><ul><li>The scene where they are in the trees waiting for the eagles to come. In the book there is no fighting scene except for the fire that Gandalf throws down from on high. Also Gandalf does not call for the Eagles... they perchance happen to see the goblin hoards and investigate finding the dwarfs and Gandalf in the trees. The film adds in a fighting scene between Thorin and Azog (which Bilbo stupidly features), I presume to build up the coming battle between the dwarfs and Azog.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The eagles then come but unfortunately we get no dialogue between the eagles and the hobbit/dwarf fellowship. Once again the eagles are sidelined (just as in LOTR) as convenient Taxi's with no explanation of why the eagles left them where they did or insights into their life on middle earth / why they didn't ride eagles to the lonely mountain. The book answers these questions, the film creates problems.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bilbo's use of the sword (unnecessary). Film: Bilbo had slain 2-3 foes. Book: Bilbo had slain none.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bilbo found the ring because he fell from a dwarf who was carrying him in the dark DARK tunnels whilst being chased by Goblins. He had to hide from Goblins all alone and happened upon Gollum. In the film, Golllum happens upon Bilbo. However the scene following was incredible.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The trolls did not take their ponies... The dwarf crew were hungry and saw a fire, investigating it they were put in sacks by the Goblins. In the film we got an unnecessary fight scene that only dulled subsequent fight scenes. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are about 4 additional fight scenes.... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We could have had some more dialogue and more exploration of the people's of middle earth. The dwarfs spend 2weeks in Rivendell in the book. The film portrays an hour or two, barely an evening and cheapens the richness of Rivendell. In the book the dwarfs didn't want to leave Rivendell, in the film they didn't like salad!!! That scene is a disgrace to Tolkien's work. I'm sure some thought it funny, but if you know the books then you've been handed a stone when you expected a gem.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How the dwarfs came to be captured by the goblins. Not true to the story. Bilbo was also captured, but for some reason he is invisible before he gets the ring questioning the whole point of the ring in the first place.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The dwarfs are a little more developed in terms of character in the book and you certainly know who is who. In the film you'd be hard pressed to put a name to any of the faces other than Thorin, Bombur and Kili.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lack of elves. When the dwarfs came to Rivendell they were greeted by many singing elves in the trees.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Saruman the white cannot recognise the blade... he looks like a fool. It's the equivalent of me showing Saruman a knife and a fork saying, ""here is a knife and a fork"" and him replying, ""what proof do you have?"" Honestly; SOOOO STUPID! He was supposedly a great wizard before the events in FOTR... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Overall, TOO MUCH fighting and cheapening/over simplifying of the source material. There weren't many real battles apart from in the goblin caves in the book to the point where the film left us. The film makes out middle earth to be more dangerous than the time Frodo sets out on his adventure. Frodo by this logic should technically have several foes to deal with in the first 40mins of his leaving the shire not just the black riders.</li></ul><br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/><ul><li>The additional scenes with Gandalf and the other wizards / necromancer. Does not feature in the book but really nice to find out what Gandalf is up to. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The songs</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The jokes and riddles, mostly taken straight out of the book. Tolkien's lines were always the best</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The actor playing Bilbo does a great job</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The soundtrack except when they used the black rider theme to show Thorin Oakenshield charging at Azog at the tree scene. IT NEVER HAPPENED. Secondly, Azog is not menacing enough to deserve such music, the film however wants Azog to fill a ""sauron"" hole when there wasn't one in the first place.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of actors, setting etc. Awesome!!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Talking elvish. Nice. Though at times it felt unnatural, but it was still nice!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I like the dialogue when Bilbo and Gandalf are involved.</li></ul><br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>Great film! Worth seeing! If they just cut some of the fighting scenes it would have been more impressive, it seemed like every opportunity to have a fighting scene was milked and to the film's detriment. This took away the tension in fighting scenes, and cheapened the film as a whole. I like action scenes, two towers done a great job there, but the source material does not support it nor hold up to it so well 8/10.<br/><br/>Fighting scenes: 6.5-7/10 Dialogue scenes: 9-9.5/10"

","This movie could have been cut by an hour. It's just way too dragged out. Every scene is three times as long as it should be and this results in breaking up the narrative and losing any dramatic build up. That is the problem when there is a short novel split into 3 movies - there just isn't enough to plot last 9 hours! The monsters were repetitive: trolls orcs and whatever! There is so much inconsequential dialog. That dinner at Bilbo's house was interminable. And the scene with gollum just went on and on with so many riddles. The only exciting part was the fight at the end with the tree. But it wasn't worth the 2 and a half hours before that.<br/><br/>The scenery is beautiful but the unrealistically deep valleys and caves feel fake.<br/><br/>Don't bother unless you are a die hard fan or you enjoy a bunch of ugly middle aged men running around with a variety of hard to understand British accents."

","I went the day it was released to watch it at 12.30pm to a virtually empty cinema - which was nice.<br/><br/>Overall I did find it entertaining but it differed quite a lot from the book and overall I thought it was a weaker effort than any of the 3 of The Lord of the Rings films that preceded it.<br/><br/>I found the film to be very frenetic and many of the scenes ""over the top"". I also did not like many of the differences from the book. I think the strength of The Lord Of The Rings films was that is stayed close to the book. It's been nearly 2 decades since I read The Hobbit but even now I can think of at least a dozen changes.<br/><br/>The main one that I disliked was the introduction of yet another ""super orc"" - similar to the one that killed Boromir in The Lord Of The Rings. A large amount of the plot in this first film revolved around this character that does not exist at all in the book! <br/><br/>Another thing I disliked was that some of the dwarfs are completely anonymous. I kid you not when I say one of them had maybe 5 lines in the whole of the nearly 3 hour film. I think a slower paced film with more focus on the characterisation would have made this a much better film.<br/><br/>I thought the Goblin sequence was fairly poor - again too fast and ridiculous in places.<br/><br/>As for what I liked - the scenery was superb as were the special effects. Many of the scenes were also entertaining even if they were slightly different to what happened in the book.<br/><br/>I am confident the forth coming films will improve.<br/><br/>It's a decent film and probably one you will find entertaining, but it's not a great film.<br/><br/>If you have read the books and are expecting a close rendition of it you are likely to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I'd say this film is to The Hobbit as Troy was to The Iliad."

The new characters, the dwarfs were a lot better than I had expected and unlike many others I wasn't bothered by the excellent video quality, I don't know what all the fuss was about.

When I heard they were going to make 2(3) movies out of a very short book I expected them to use a lot of the backstory from The Appendices, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.<br/><br/>Instead they completely rewrite the history of Middle-Earth, weaken Gandalf in order to build up Radagast and to compress 500 years into 5 days and basically give us a huge amount of filler they made up for the movie when the original story would have been more interesting and more engaging if properly expanded instead of being completely rewritten.<br/><br/>Its a good movie, but its far short of the standards of the LOTR films, which at least stayed true to the spirit of the books. If it had stayed more true to the source material it would have been at least twice the movie it actually is.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is full of plot holes, missing explanations and bland filler.<br/><br/>The extremely high frame rate makes everyone seem fat-faced in close-ups, although the 3D effect is impressively floating.<br/><br/>And Glamdring still doesn't glow around orcs, and nor does Orcrist; despite Gandalf saying all elf blades do and the goblin king actually mentioning Glamdring is supposed to shine like daylight.<br/><br/>And Gandalf still summons the eagles through freaking Moths! That was a dumb idea from the beginning, sigh.<br/><br/>Its just a disappointing movie."
"freemantle_uk","8","8","18","24 December 2012"," A fun revisit to Middle-Earth
","The original Lord of the Rings is one of the best novel series and film series ever and it has been a long journey for the adaptation of The Hobbit. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a welcome returned to Middle-Earth, even if it does not match the heights of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>The Kingdom of Erebor is the greatest Dwarf kingdom in Middle-Earth. It was built on the wealth of the materials of The Lonely Mountain. But the Dwarfs of the kingdom are exiled after Smaug the Dragon overruns the Dwarf forces and the Elves refuse to help. The rightful king of the kingdom, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) is determined to reclaim his birth right no matter the cost, and with 12 other dwarfs at his side, goes on a quest to recapture The Lonely Mountain.<br/><br/>Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) is a part of the dwarf company, wanting to ensure Smaug does not ally with other dark forces of Middle-Earth, and it is up to him to find the 14th member of the company. He decides to recruit the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) as a burglar because hobbits are light on their feet, even though Bilbo has never set foot out of The Shire and is too attached to his home comforts.<br/><br/>Besides a fiery death, many outside factors affect the company's quest: a lack of support from other dwarfs, the political tensions between Thorin and the elves and the return of an old threat to Middle-Earth. The company is also being hunted by Thorin's great rival, Azog (Manu Bennett) ""The Pale Orc,"" who looks very much like an Orc version of Kratos from the God of War series.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a much shorter novel then any of The Lord of the Rings novels; it clocks in at around 400 pages. To make it into a new trilogy, Peter Jackson and his team had to expand the story using expanded material from Tolkien stories and a little bit of artistic license. Elements of the story from the novel have been altered and embellished, such as the rivalry between Thorin and Azog, the Elves saving the Dwarfs before reaching Rivendell and the events involving Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) discovering a new evil in Mirkwood. Of course the previous trilogy also embellished the story, particularly The Two Towers. For fans of the original novel there are some fun references, from lines of dialogue and voice-over to the story of Bilbo's ancestor.<br/><br/>Jackson employs a lighter tone for the prequel, using more comedy than previous films. Of course there was comedy in the original trilogy and the tone of The Hobbit was written as children's novel. When the dwarfs arrive at Bilbo's home it was tonally light and there are some genuinely funny moments, particularly involving the trolls and the dwarfs. Because of the nature of the story and the way it was told it is a slightly more family friendly film.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey stills supplies plenty of fantasy action that you want and expect. Jackson delivers plenty top-notch special effects and creative action sequences when they are on screen, especially the fight within the Misty Mountains. As a fan, there were some nice little improvements, the biggest being the wargs which actually looked like wolves, not those silly looking hydras that they were in The Two Towers. Fans can also look forward to another fantastic score provided by Howard Shore, hitting every note perfectly.<br/><br/>Jackson does assemble a great cast for the prequel. Of course old players like McKellen, Andy Serkis and co. do their parts justice and Armitage was perfect as Thorin. Armitage brought to life the bitter warrior longing for crown, a seriously minded fellow who did provide on the action stakes. Freeman was also a strong performer as the hobbit in question, the reluctant hero of the piece who is forced to come into his own.<br/><br/>A problem with the film is some inconsistencies with the Dwarfs in terms of some being more prominent than others. Balin and Bofur were played by recognisable actors Ken Stott and James Nesbitt and their profile led to them having decent screen time. But other characters simply disappear off the screen, having no personality or characteristics and are just noticeable because of their appearance. This despite the profiles the studio created. But this is also a problem with the novel where some of the dwarfs felt like they did not need to be in the movie.<br/><br/>The running time is 2 hours 50 minutes, which is long. A straight adaptation of The Hobbit would have easily have fit into a film lasting even less than that. Some scenes could have been trimmed and the scenes involving the wider context felt inconsequential at the moment. But The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not disgrace the legacy of the original trilogy and it is still one of the best medieval set fantasy films since Return of the King.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"
"juggernautkk","9","8","18","24 December 2012"," Well Done
","Still remember walking out of the first LOTR movie feeling a little disappointed although knowing 'movie' retelling needs to appeal to a wider audience, I can say I was not disappointed in the first Hobbit movie, a book I have read more than 20 times. A lot of action and humor as expected while keeping the general storyline. For better or worse, an entire new story was added and much of the charm of the book is lost, but keeping in mind The Hobbit was a children's book written in the 1920s. Today's audience seems less interested in overcoming adversity using wit and cunning but rather force. This was taken to its limit, making the often hapless hobbit and dwarfs from the book into the sword-wielding protagonists we cheer for. Specifically I was happy they added at least two-thirds of the Riddles in the Dark chapter, that would have been an easy cut for the director but to me an absolute necessity to keep at least part of the story's integrity.<br/><br/>While I could not help but notice every difference in the movie versus the book, I think the most nit-picky I felt was only in wishing Bilbo was a little heavier to start, and Thorin a little older. I'd heard it was divided into three parts, and kept wondering where they would stop. The first film actually goes to nearly half of the book, even with the added story lines, so was completely satisfied with how far they had progressed before the credits. Is it a must see? Yes, if only for the simple reason that The Hobbit, arguably the most beloved children's book ever, had not had a feature film ever made of it (heck, they made a Cat in the Hat movie)."
"kaiminc","9","8","18","23 December 2012"," Great watch
","The Hobbit is well-paced, starts with more of a back-story and introduction of the main characters before exploding with an action-packed second half. I can't remember all the little details from the book but the arc of the movie follows the book closely, which in my opinion is good.<br/><br/>Most of the actors carried off their roles well but the one that stood out for me was Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. The movie version of Thorin has a lot more steel than the one in the book. Although Bilbo Baggins is the main character of this story, Peter Jackson has done a good job of fleshing out the main characters, giving enough screen time to each of them, especially Gandalf and Thorin.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend The Hobbit - I will watch it again myself, this time on 48fps format!"
"Foxbarking","9","8","18","23 December 2012"," An Improvement on the Material
","I know by having such a title for a review will probably earn me the hate of many people. I have always felt that J.R.R. Tolkien was a bit of a paradox. He had such wonderful and amazing ideas (even though the vast majority of these stories can be found in Beowulf) and such a dull talent for writing them. Of course, being that these novels are among the most loved and revered ever written, I know that this is simply my own take on them. I am happy that they work for so many others, but they never did with me. I always came away liking what Tolkien had to say, but never how he tried to say it.<br/><br/>The first thing I have noticed from many people reviewing ""The Hobbit"" is how it deviates from the book. I find this mostly surprising because the whole ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy deviated from the book greatly and it is one of the most popular and well rated movies series ever. Frodo from the movie was nothing like Frodo from the book, where he was more of a middle aged, kind gentlemanly type than the teenager hobbit they made him in the movie. A whole 100 pages and a major character from the first book is dropped. My favorite deviation being that half of ""The Two Towers"" movie is based off a battle that took 20 pages to tell in the book.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Peter Jackson and company have taken the general idea of Tolkien's stories and told them in a way that I can relate to. This is why I enjoyed the first trilogy and why, it seems, I will enjoy the second one. I feel that the cartoon of ""The Hobbit"" was very true to the material and I recall that I have never watched a cartoon that was so dreadfully boring.<br/><br/>My only two issues with the first of these movies is that it seems a little forced when it starts out. For about fifteen minutes, I was seeing the actors and not the characters. However, once that was past, it became more involving.<br/><br/>The other is how they got to Rivendale and the reaction to getting there. They made it seem like they accidentally stumbled upon Rivendale, even though it was revealed to be Gandalf's plan. However, I would assume that such a huge kingdom in such a large mountain area would be not only difficult to stumble upon, but incredulous to think that the dwarfs would not know they were heading in that direction.<br/><br/>Other than these two things, I was captivated totally. I think the direction was wonderful, once again giving us such wonderful shots of the New Zealand countryside. I have to agree with Peter Jackson that New Zealand is the only place on the world that actually could be Middle Earth. The actors knew their roles well. Even Ian McKellan was able to portray Gandalf as the wizard who has not yet ascended to the higher level he did during the war of the ring. After a slightly awkward beginning, I was totally able to see Martin Freeman as the younger version of Ian Holm's character. Being a huge fan of Holm, I do not give that adulation lightly.<br/><br/>We will all form our opinions of this movie for different reasons. If you haven't seen it, try to go in without preconceived notions. Do not be of the opinion that taking a small book and making it into three three hour movies will make it dreadful. It doesn't. This has started the telling of the story of very good material in a way that makes it more enjoyable than ever."
"Geschichtenerzaehler","9","8","18","20 December 2012"," Expect it to be different from the Lord of the Rings movies
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of the movie adaption of J.R.R. Tolkiens ""The Hobbit"". It was written years before ""The Lord of the Rings"" and intended for a younger audience. Making it into a movie after ""The Lord of the Rings"", is a very difficult task. The Hobbit's tone is quite light hearted and it's literarily somewhat inferior to its sequel. Also, for consistency some changes to the story would have to be made. Thus I was a little skeptical before I saw it.<br/><br/>After seeing the first part now, I can say the result is very good so far. It's not a perfect movie, but far from bad. There are some problems with Tolkiens book and as far as the story was told, they were handled very well. It went by the book where it should have and went different ways where it was necessary.<br/><br/>One of the greatest weaknesses is probably Radagast. Most of the parts involving him were way too goofy for my taste. Another problem was the story telling rhythm. Some scenes felt jumpy, others felt stretched too thin.<br/><br/>Anyway: Prepare to see a more humorous and playful movie than the Lord of the Rings films. I'm definitely looking forward to the next parts."
"mattdirect10","7","8","18","15 December 2012"," Really Good LOTR Prequel
","""The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey"" is a surprisingly good film. Ian McKellen is great as reprising his role, ""Gandalf the Grey"". Martin Freeman plays as a great Bilbo Baggins. And Richard Armitage was very good as Thorin Oakenshield. The other 12 dwarfs don't have a great personality as the three main characters,and are more played for laughs,but that doesn't mean their annoying either. The character that does steal the film is the return of Gollum.<br/><br/>The film shows iconic scenes like ""The Riddle Game"" and ""The Mountain Trolls"". I was surprised by the Nazgul cameo in the film. Before I go into the problems with the film, I didn't see it in 3D, or HFR 3D. I saw it in 2D. The running time clocks in about 3 hrs., which can be irritating to a lot of people, when the story doesn't move further for an hour. Peter Jackson uses CGI on all of the Goblins and Orcs, which was a pain. Where as in the LOTR, all of the Orcs are make-up effects.<br/><br/>My final thought on the film is, if you Love LOTR and want to see it in theaters, see it in 2D first before you try it in HFR 3D or RealD 3D. If you do have a problem sitting in the theater for 3 hrs., rent or buy it when it's available on Home Video, otherwise, Highly Recommended! I'm looking forward to the next Hobbit films and the Extended Edition of this film (that's if they release one)."
"conor-427-922708","10","8","18","14 December 2012"," A slow start, but it takes it's time to become something magnificent
","First of all don't judge the film itself positively or negatively strictly due to the OPTION of seeing it in 48 fps. Now the beginning of the film is slow and at times doesn't even feel like LOTR due to the lack of familiar faces. The wait is worth it because at about fifty minutes in the movie picks up and becomes something extraordinary. This is the point where old friends, incredible fighting choreography, majestic cinematography, and stand out performances truly come together. Peter Jackson takes his time finding his way back to the LOTR glory, but when he does he comes back with just as much strength. I'm not saying this is another LOTR and it shouldn't be because this is something else. The second half of this film is phenomenal and if P.J. can continue with this momentum throughout the next two films then we are in for quite a treat."

What amazed me most is that visual effects and 3D effects were used not solely for the sake of effects, but quite in place, used to create that special atmosphere, spirit of adventure and suspense rather than merely to show off the achievements of modern visual graphics.

"nino-jovcov","10","9","21","24 December 2012"," I didn't want to believe it was over
","I was rubbing my eyes, trying to convince myself that i don't see the credits. Fastest 169 minutes of my life, and i didn't watch it in 48fps, only 3D. First, i must say i am a big Tolkien fan, and my favorite books and movies are trilogy ""The Lord of The Rings"". Second, i must say i am a big fantasy fan, i even write it (not famous yet). Third, i must say i have traveled 200km (100 in one direction) only to see this movie (i don't have a cinema in my town), and paid 1200 Serbian dinars (about 10 euros) for the trip and cinema ticket. Even if the movie was bad, i would't have the guts to say i didn't like it. But i have the honor to say that i was worth even much more.<br/><br/>That have been said, i can review the title. Simply, amazing. I don't want to diminish Tolkien's work, but i think it exceeded the book (it's not better, those two are different type of art, they cannot be compared like that), it has more to say but in a simpler way. I don't want to spoil anything, you will see which of the parts of the book are in there, which aren't, which are changed and which are added from other Tolkien's work and director's and screen writer's imagination. Peter Jackson outdone himself (it's not better than LOTR but i can equal it with TFOTR) in making a movie after the book.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson with help of Del Toro made a really good, family classic, expanding the book, popping up many questions and making it for all ages (book was written chiefly for kids). Martin Freeman (except for the first 20 sec of appearance) did an Oscar worth job. Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Andy Serkis and rest of the cast did really good too. Music is fantastic, both the new theme and the old ones which awoke nostalgia. Visual effects and costume design are probably the best i have seen ever, even better than LOTR. My mouth were dry after the movie, i couldn't close them, from scene to scene effects and landscape get more and more breathtaking. Orcs, Goblins and Trolls were updated and enhanced (you'll see how when you watch the movie).<br/><br/>I wanted this review to get an objective tone, so i must mention flaws of the film, which he had, like every other thing in this world. A few logical and material mistakes, story not rounded (it couldn't be, it's one book split in 2 + 1 movies) and some motives repeated from LOTR. But i must say, i am quite impressed, and my expectations which were high, were surpassed maybe even twice. If it came out before LOTR series, maybe, just maybe it would have been better, but even now the future trilogy will be a really wonderful and appropriate prequel. Can't wait for the second part. I warmly recommend it to everyone (not just fantasy and Tolkien's or LOTR fans). Really nice Christmas gift from Mr. Jackson and rest of the crew."
"Vartiainen","Null","9","21","24 December 2012"," Immensely enjoyable
","I don't understand the critics' reaction to this film. Well, I can accept some of their criticism, but I still feel that they're judging this film far too harshly. Perhaps it's the hype that quite frankly got blown out of proportions, or perhaps they reacted negatively to the decision to separate a simple children's story into three films, or perhaps they just expected another epic on par with The Lord of the Rings saga.<br/><br/>And I cannot claim I wasn't equally as cautious, having seen the trailers, knowing the book and realizing that they would have to add a lot of padding. So I was prepared to be disappointed. Luckily, my fears were ill-founded and what I received was an adventure I haven't experienced since the original LotR films. A sentence written by a fellow fan sums up my feelings perfectly: ""It felt like coming home after a long journey."" Exactly. And yes, I realize that as a major Tolkien fan my viewpoint is heavily biased, but that's what this film does to you. It has its flaws, but I just cannot bring myself to care. It's Middle-earth.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong, it's not good just because it's Middle-earth. It's a genuinely great film on its own. And this wasn't an easy story to adapt into a film, especially when you want to make it a prequel to the LotR films. Because the original book in all honestly doesn't work as a prequel to the LotR books all that well. It's just a merry little children's adventure with humour and high adventure. Some of its events work as a backstory to LotR, but sometimes it feels like it's not even set in the same universe, the tone is so different. So adaptation was always going to cause controversy, because there isn't a good compromise to be had. Personally I think that Jackson strikes a good balance here. The film is a lot more humorous than the LotR films, but at the same time there are hints of events yet to come and you can pinpoint the certain events that would eventually lead to the War of the Rings and the downfall of Sauron. These scenes tie the film to the greater story and even though the constant shifts in tone might bother someone, I think that Jackson manages to balance the two aspects rather well.<br/><br/>What I think Jackson got exactly right are the characters. The returning characters still feel the same, and in some cases even better. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) had improved the most and the scene where Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Gollum meet is easily the best one in the film. The mood, the atmosphere, the dialogue, the slowly building tension, it's absolutely haunting in quality. And luckily the new characters don't disappoint either. Martin Freeman outshines the rest with a performance that absolutely nails the character of Bilbo Baggins, but the dwarfs aren't bad either. Thorin Richard Armitage) gets the most screen time as he by all means should, which unfortunately though doesn't leave too much time for the rest of them. The same problem exists in the book, so it's not completely Jackson's fault. There simple are too many dwarfs to give them all enough screen time to develop their personalities properly. Jackson tries his best though and I think that he succeeds admirably, given the circumstances. Most of the dwarfs look different enough and all of them have at least one quirk that makes them stand out from the rest. You still can't tell which one was Nori and which one Ori by the end of the film, but you at least have an inclination about most of them. It's not much, but it's something.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the characters do work. The other thing that I liked is the score, because well, it's Howard Shore, and even if we discount that I still find myself humming the main theme under my breath, and its been almost two weeks. I also quite liked the action, which once again reflected the more humorous tone of the film. It was flashy, fast-paced and filled with a lot of creativity. Sure some might claim that it was more silly than anything, but I think that it fitted and at least it was enjoyable to watch, especially from a big screen. And of course the visuals are still some of the best the industry has to offer. The sweeping landscapes of New Zealand looked good back then and they still do. The monsters and various caves and buildings are equally awe-inspiring and a lot of time has been spent on the details.<br/><br/>Then the grievances and the nitpicking. The biggest complain that I have against this film is the voice acting. The orcs and goblins in LotR films sounded great with lots of growling and screeching, with sharp gutturals. And the orcs in The Hobbit still sound like that, but the trolls and especially the goblins are just unbelievably bad. A humongous goblin king should not sound like an educated middle-aged British merchant. It completely ruins the effect. But if that's the worst I can say about this film, well... it's a nitpick if even that. There were some other minor points that I would have personally changes, mostly dealing with changes to the story, but nothing major or anything that could have potentially ruined the film.<br/><br/>As a whole it's a very strong film. The tone is a bit of a problem and it has too many characters, but what it gets right, it gets absolutely right. It's Jackson's Middle-earth and I like it very, very much. Is it as good as the LotR films? Not quite, but it isn't far away. I saw it once and I walked back in the next day with a smile on my face. That's about the biggest compliment I can pay to a film and this film more than deserved it."

","I loved the Tolkien works so much as a kid that I often have mixed feelings with Jackson's work - he does a great job of casting and cinematography, but goes overboard where I don't think it's necessary. That holds true here, where the CGI just gets out of control too often in what is otherwise a fairly spectacular if overdone film. The Hobbit was more of a fairy tale than ""serious"" fantasy, so I don't take Jackson to task for any plot deviations from the source work. Actually, he develops another wizard, Radagast, in a way that was unfortunately ignored by Tolkien. And he also wraps in familiar characters from the trilogy that fans of those movies will appreciate. His idea to take a book shorter than any of the trilogy and expand it into three distinct movies is also inspired. Great stuff, only marred by the excessive CGI and a way too long running time with too much filler. Unlikely that he will tone it down for the second and third parts but you can always hope... P.S. I have watched the LOR movies many times each. I have no interest in ever seeing this movie or the sequel again. I don't know what that means except it just feels really overlong and overcooked."

I was wrong, the pace, script and scene structure of the film are excellent - free-flowing, fast paced and overall consistent with The Hobbit.<br/><br/>Visually, it is quite breathtaking, most memorable for me are the eagles gliding through the sun drenched sky, the 48fps adds exceptional detail to every scene making the fight scenes especially, even more engaging than the LOTR battles. ""Eye-straining"" Perhaps that particular critic should refrain from judging 3d movies, because my partner and myself found the animation beautiful and easy on the eyes, and we were in the most straining of positions 1 row from the screen.<br/><br/>Having seen the film all faith in Jackson and his team is restored, with such a formidable cast, excellent visual capabilities and one of the most exciting adventures still to be revealed, I am confident that the Hobbit series will be completed with great success, and easily stand side by side among the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>A truly excellent and worthy addition to our world of Middle Earth."

","I watched this movie in ""High Frame Rate 3D"" This was similar to ""Movie Plus"" on my Samsung which I disabled because I did not like it one bit. This made the special effects look cheap and no better than the special effects on a movie made for T.V. The first 30 minutes of the movie bored me to death but it picked up as it went on. Its attempt at humor was flat in my opinion or maybe it's because it was more ""English"" humor that just didn't translate well. I also believe there are two scenes within the movie that should have been shorter because they were just unnecessary to the main plot. If you decide to watch this movie, you'll know which scenes those are. The best part of the movie for me was the last 15 minutes not including the credits."

","We went along to the cinema having been given tickets by someone who couldn't go. Turned out we were going to see the 3D version filmed in 48 frames per second (fps). This is an apparent improvement. I'd say it was detrimental to the enjoyment of the film (I could see that in the normal, 2D version it would have been a fine experience).<br/><br/>Basically, this version made us feel a little queasy, altogether uneasy and question our eyes - or our glasses - and seemed to give the film a ""hand-held camera"" quality.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed 3d in the past with films such as Avatar and Coraline, but not here.

","The critics try to compare this movie to LOTR and that is why they are disappointed with the outcome of this film. LOTR is a more mature movie based on a more mature book series. The Hobbit was made as a children's book and therefore the movie comes off a bit more childlike.<br/><br/>The movie itself was epic! Peter Jackson once again proved he could recreate Tolkien's world. Although there are some minor points in this film that have been added, eliminated, or altered from the book, Jackson did a great job and the movie was stunning and entertaining. It is impossible to take a book and remake it into a movie without some inconsistencies. There were some in LOTR that some people may forget. Jackson has added some material from Tolkien's The Silmarillion into the Hobbit that was otherwise mentioned briefly or not mentioned at all in the Hobbit in order to build up the story for LOTR which happens after the Hobbit.<br/><br/>I encourage all LOTR to watch this without fear of being let down because of what the critics are saying. I also encourage those who may have never read the Hobbit to READ IT before seeing this movie. Spots that are vague in Tolkien's writing are open for imagination. Those points of imagination are filled with this movie."

","I saw the movie on 12/12/12 in Zurich. Our party purposely booked the 48FPS 3D version.

Also the 48FPS are very noticeable, but in a positive way. Breathtaking! I will be watching it again though in 24FPS 3D just to compare. And then again at 24FPS 2D...<br/><br/>I am a Tolkien geek who loves the books. Still I am very well aware that certain changes are necessary to bring the story to the big screen effectively.<br/><br/>I read the Hobbit and the appendices just a couple of weeks before seeing the movie and I was delighted that certain scenes made it into the movie almost one-to-one not only from The Hobbit, but also from the Lord of the Rings appendices. And for the changes that Peter Jackson and his team made, I fully OK with them. After all this is their interpretation of the books. <br/><br/>To me as a Tolkien geek, this gives the movie so much more history and richness, just beautiful! A lot people in early reviews complained about the running time of The Hobbit. That it's too long. Well our entire party (also non-geeks and average movie goers) after the movie did not feel like 'phew, it's finally over' but rather felt like 'what? over already, oh man can't wait to see it again...'... which we gladly will.<br/><br/>Don't trust any movie critics, go and see The Hobbit yourself to judge it.

","I had high hopes for The Hobbit, after Peter Jackson, Warner Bros, and the NZ government sold off our labour laws for this $540,000,000 monster. Alas I was met with disappointment. For a start the 48fps made everything look false, ultimately giving off the sheen of a Syfy movie. It also exposed the overacting/movement of Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman, and dodgy polystyrene set pieces. The problem with stretching out a book as small as The Hobbit into three long films is stretching out the content. It felt like I was watching the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Hobbtannica) there was a lot of information we really didn't need to know. Nothing was left to the imagination and the bombardment of information, which did very little to progress any sense of plot or storyline, became very boring. While the songs were great (minus the repetitive score), the cheesy and usually pointless dialogue had me shaking my head. Andy Serkis as Gollum seems to bring the only sense of saviour to this film and I struggle to see how the next two will cope without him (if he isn't in them). Overall the humour was childish, It was boring despite being action packed, and I can't see this franchise sustaining my attention for the next two films. However I must say Weta Digital have done an outstanding job on the visual effects as always."
"elie-fares16","7","12","31","12 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Enjoyable Yet Disappointing Journey
","Q: What do you, as Hollywood, do to a movie series that has garnered tremendous commercial success and massive critical acclaim? A: You revisit it. Of course.<br/><br/>The Hobbit will surely be a massive commercial success. But it won't garner any significant awards like its Middle Earth predecessors, which are its successors story-wise. The Return of the King has won a record 11 academy awards.<br/><br/>Set prior to the events of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit, their prequel, follows the story of Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's uncle, as he travels with a group of dwarfs who, with the help of Gandalf the wizard, will try to recuperate their kingdom Erebor from a dragon named Smaug that has overtaken it many years prior.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, who also directed the Lord of the Rings trilogy, uses state of the art technology in shooting the movie.The first cinematic feature to be shot in 46 frames per second, The Hobbit is visually stunning to look at. The art direction is impeccable. The colors feel richer and the scenes crisper to look at. The movie's dwarfs, orcs, goblins and hobbits are, of course, superbly executed. The battle scenes are gripping set-pieces. The locations in New Zealand, similarly to its predecessors in the series, chosen to shoot the movie are absolutely breathtaking, making for a Middle Earth that still feels enchanting although it's not as absorbing as the one we had in the previous three movies.<br/><br/>At a running time of almost three hours, The Hobbit sports many side-plots that don't serve the main story at all – and all these side-plots are dragged out in extensive scenes that only serve to increase the movie's length without offering anything in value to it. The overall results becomes an overly stuffed movie that could have had so many absolutely useless moments removed, making the overall product tighter and more polished. Alas, that is not the case. Instead, you get prolonged long shots of our heroes as they travel through mountains, hills and lakes with many seconds and minutes added to scenes that have already ended for an extra artistic effect such as taking the camera slowly upwards to capture the head of a statue while the movie's protagonists stand under it. It could be this overly slow pace at times that takes away from the movie's grandeur and from the story's spine.<br/><br/>What you are left with is an enjoyable movie – but nothing that reaches the levels of epic that oozed from every single moment of The Lord of the Rings. What you get is a movie that, while it manages stands on its own, can't escape the comparisons from much worthier predecessors. The overall tone of the series has also changed into something less dramatic at times and more comical. That's not necessarily a good thing.<br/><br/>The movie's best scene, which, unlike many other moments, stays true to its equivalent in the book, is the first encounter ever between Gollum and Bilbo Baggins which grips at you and doesn't let go. It doesn't disappoint. And even though that scene's outcome is already known, the emotional aspect that's portrayed by a brilliant Andy Serkis as the emaciated hobbit Smeagol (Gollum) who's even better than in Lord of the Rings and a great Martin Freeman (Baggins) still manages to resonate and pack a punch. That riddles game is just too good on paper not to be good cinema. And how could anyone resist my precious?<br/><br/>As the movie ends, Bilbo Baggins says ""I do believe the worst is behind us."" I certainly hope that the upcoming two movies are better – but I'm not holding my breath. The problem is that the story on which this movie is based is not substantial enough for it to be turned into three movies. The add-ons which were brought from other Tolkien-related books aren't giving the story depth but making it feel bloated. Some single sentences in the book were turned into full- blown scenes. The end result can be explained in the following way: The Hobbit is like an overly stuffed and overly cooked meal that you love. You can't help but compare it to previous times when the meal wasn't as stuffed and overcooked. And once it's done, it leaves a bitter aftertaste that you can't shake off. But there are still some bites there that make you go: man, this is good. It's a damn shame.<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>You can find my review at stateofmind13.com as well."

","I thought the Lord of the Rings trilogy was excellent!! So, when ""The Hobbit"" came out, I was extremely eager to see the film... until I started reading reviews. Life got in the way of me seeing the movie in theatre, but I ordered my copy on Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>I had the afternoon off. Had some pizza and my Coke, and started the movie. I wake up and the credits are playing -- seriously. So, I chapter search back to find where I fell asleep... 35mins. The next day being a Saturday, I start at 35mins and I wake up to see a magnificent battle scene with orcs and the dwarfs. Woah, what did I miss? I chapter search back to find that I fell asleep at 65mins in. It took 3 sittings to watch this disaster of a movie -- and I'm not one for falling asleep during movies.<br/><br/>I'd challenge anyone to tell me the significance of the first 50minutes of movie. Way to put an audience to sleep with meaningless dwarf antics for most of an hour. This 50minutes could've been accomplished easily within 15mins. Frequently, the story dwells on 'nothing' but merely showcases how much money Peter Jackson must have accessible to waste this much film.<br/><br/>If the Hobbit book didn't exist. If this wasn't the prequel to the Lord of the Rings. If this was simply the first notion of ""The Hobbit"", this would be a disaster. The only reason it has been a success is it peaked the curiosity of LOTR fans. But then again, who am I to say... 8.2 avg viewers rating speaks volumes. For me, this was brilliant special effects, great acting, and extremely poor story execution! The movie failed enough for me, that I'll like rent the sequels on pay-per-view, but have no interest in shelling our $12 for a movie ticket or $25 for the Blu-Ray."

","The movie is a bit disappointing. This split in 3 parts seems like a big commercial thing. The rhythm get slower because of this, and the movie which is good looses interest. Also, trolls are not very well made, they look like a joke whereas they where really bad asses in the book. Compared to the lord of the ring, we do not really get into the characters, they seems very simple and lots of first degree jokes about all the dwarfs makes it silly. What i did however like : the introduction of golum, real nice and scary ! Best in the movie.

","I went to see the Hobbit with not much expectation of seeing Great Story. I already knew that the special effects and imagery would be beyond comparison. The acting would be very high-class. But, I got surprise the way the story was told. One can argue that it has many similarities with Fellowship of the Ring. There are few extra things that was not really needed. Such as the troll scene, the Goblin part was not needed, and the Mountain Scene was not needed. I feel that these scenes slow don the movie a bit. However, I really enjoyed the Hobbit. It would have been a Masterpiece if more consideration was given on the script. NOw to the thing that compelled me to write this review is the scene between GOLLUM AND BILBO.

","this is what happens when you don't focus enough on character development and have a thin storyline. I was so disappointed, but it you never follow up the best trilogy in history with a knockout. highlights of the movie are the new elements, but they are few, meaning you walk out of this movie wishing you had of just rented it (and could stop yawning). Firstly, the relationships just aren't there. Unlike the Trilogy there is no buddy movie start with Mr Froddo and SAM. no slow building up of the troop, and the link from Gandalf to Bilbo is tenuous. And Gandalf is just plonked in the movie without much back story. Its hard to care about the characters if they don't really care that much for each other. This prequel pushes the concept of home hard, but the writer should have spent more time on the characters, and less on assumed knowledge of those involved."

","The first installment of J R R Tolkien's The Hobbit novel is extraordinary. I haven't watched the LOTR trilogy but have heard a lot. Nor have I read any of those books. But after watching I am gonna read those including The Silmarillion.<br/><br/>It is indeed a very unexpected movie experience with all the colors, essence, hue and magic. I was taken aback by how the plot revolves around the people most valuable and then etches the story onto our minds. Every sequence - one after another will bring you closer to the screen, and if it's 3D then bang! Absolute marvel!<br/><br/>The adventure to back home shows many life values, aspects and notions including home-sickness. Martin Freeman is great and I could never guess he was 41. Gandalf is mystery and yet he knows why he had called the lead character of the series which he is not at that time. You feel a peculiar kind of happiness when things gel and you are not confused at the movie.<br/><br/>Special effects is fantastic, screenplay is intriguing, direction is magnificent and the cast and their performances are just par excellence. Bravo! is what I shout at the whole crew of this movie. Yet there are some unnerving scenes and the melodrama at the end troubled me a bit.<br/><br/>But let me tell you, this is gonna make history am sure because this is fantabulous piece of cinema!<br/><br/>WATCH OUT FOR: The conversation between Gollem & Bilbo!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"rainbowpoet","1","11","28","24 December 2012"," Make-believe that makes me believe we're all doomed
","As an artist and a human being, I am truly appalled at this travesty. I mean, this is it! This is the movie that has finally inspired me to create a Bottom 100 Movies of All Time list! It was so offensive to me that I literally feel like I've lost a piece of my humanity. I mean, where do I start? It was one contrived circumstance after another. It was a hodgepodge of blandly-written caricatures thrust into ridiculous situations that were hopelessly underdeveloped, unexplained, and cartoonish (both the caricatures and the situations). It was one pointless Hollywood action sequence after another. It was a hurricane of inconsistencies and pseudo-profundities. And it was all built on a story that should've taken five minutes to finish. Literally, I could've made a five-minute short film with this exact plot, and achieved something far more compelling than this trash, without the aid of hundreds of millions of dollars and A-list filmmakers.<br/><br/>Let's start with the story: Bilbo Baggins goes back in time (60 years, to be exact) and recounts to Frodo the ""harrowing"" (more like mind- numbing) events of his first adventure with Gandalf. When he's back in time, and Gandalf comes to his door offering an adventure like nothing he's ever experienced before, he impolitely brushes him off. Later, after Gandalf has brusquely shown up at his door with a bunch of random, uncouth dwarfs and used them to invade his privacy and his home and pillage his food supplies and other belongings, he decides, ""Oh, hey, maybe I really should go with them. I mean, after all, my life is a boring, pointless scrapbook of saccharine seconds, and I have nothing better to do or think about in the near future than my brainless, useless self, so...why not?"" Then, they go on the adventure, which consists of one random, meaningless encounter after another and a series of strange, unjustified action sequences that never once manage to keep me in suspense. Then, the movie starts putting its caricatures into jeopardy over and over again with derivative, stereotypical fantasy creatures that very easily should've killed them every time. Of course, the writers didn't want their caricatures to have to deal with loss or their audience to have to deal with depth and uncertainty, so they just decided to save their caricatures' lives in some laughably implausible way every time they put them in danger. (I mean, that scene near the end where all the caricatures are at the bottom of that slope, by the edge of the cliff, and all the trees they were standing on have been ripped from the ground by the pack of vicious wolf-beings and knocked over, subsequently forcing them all to jump onto the last tree at the very edge of the cliff to keep away from the wolf-beings. Then, as the tree continues to fall over from the weight of all these caricatures and the wolves continue to advance on them, Gandalf suddenly remembers that he has magical powers which include a staff that can apparently light pine cones on fire. So, he starts grabbing pine cones, lighting them on fire, handing them out to the dwarfs like cupcakes, and throwing them down at the wolves, which of course conveniently starts just enough of a fire to drive the wolves back and separate them from the helpless dwarfs, while not starting enough of a fire to just kill everyone. Then, later on in the scene, after one of the most ridiculous revenge-hero ego-trip battles in film history, the tree continues to ""almost fall off the edge of the cliff and kill everybody"". Wow, such originality! Then, just before they die, a bunch of huge birds that Gandalf apparently called with whispers to a butterfly swoop in and save them.) Okay, who cares? Anyone? Show of hands? I'm hoping none of you are dumb enough to fall for this blatant, pathetic excuse for a money-grab by Peter Jackson and the rest of his merry band of Hollywood thugs. Seriously, if you are, seek help. Fast. Or end up getting caught by those creepy men with butterfly nets who've been chasing you, and spend the rest of your life in white pajamas. Your choice. The point is, this movie had no story. It had no character development. It had no life. And anyone convinced otherwise is just plain idiotic.<br/><br/>Now, for the cinematography. It was magnificent! The idea of filming it in 48 frames per second was a stroke of genius by Peter Jackson. But my praise ends there, as it should.<br/><br/>As for the music, it was copy-and-paste ""composition"". AND IT WAS ALREADY MEDIOCRE THE FIRST THREE TIMES AROUND, WHEN HE USED IT FOR THE LOTR TRILOGY! There's nothing new here. Some of the instrumentation is slightly different. One of the themes is expanded upon a little. But that's it.<br/><br/>And now, for the ending: OH DEAR GOD (that I don't believe in): Why (if you do exist) do you have to let your creatures be this stupid? Please, can you explain it to everyone, 'cause we're all waiting? This movie's ending is an insult to the nonexistent intelligence of the general American public! It's not even an ending! All it is is a set-up for a sequel, meant to do absolutely nothing but entice the witless, inane, unsuspecting popcorn glutton to shell out another fifteen or so bucks for a ticket, another twenty or so for concessions, and yet another fifteen or so for an unwitting friend, date or family member to tag along. They literally just stand there, look out at the horizon, and identify the far-off mountain as the dwarfs' home that everyone's supposedly fighting for (in the worst pretend story-line EVER). And what do we learn is the point of that two hours and forty-five minutes? Absolutely nothing!<br/><br/>Nice try, Hollywood! Not all of us are as dumb as you'd love us to be."

I don't think there is one scene that's useless, I mean for people who have not read the book it's a great way to know the characters, and certain important plots. <br/><br/>Even though for its perpetual run time (something that critics should not whine about) it's definitely the movie we all have been waiting for, the movie that will inspire some people, the movie we all should watch in these holiday seasons."

Honestly, it had humor, action, and it also stayed true to the book. Sure, the story was expanded upon with information that wasn't in the original Hobbit book, but Peter Jackson plainly stated that the movie would include information taken directly out of the appendices at the end of The Return of the King book. Even if you haven't read the book you will enjoy the movie. It sets up the LOTR series so well. So I'm pretty sure that the people who gave this movie one star either haven't seen it, slept through it, just like to mess with people, or are thinking of a different movie. I really hope someone sees this so they can know that this movie is definitely worth going to see, with others or by yourself. Thanks and I hope this helps!"

Well, thanks to the techniques used the movie can be disturbing, AT FIRST, because it looks real and thats weird for us to adapt to but going back to standard definition after it its tough. Another problem is that its not a stupid movie. Mind me, it has 1 and an 1/2 hours of chasing, fighting in such a pyrotechnic way that can only please but it has even time to let you think and admire the gorgeous world thats being unfolded in front of your eyes. Our generation of viewers doesn't agree too much with that. We are going towards a video game/cinema style of stories and ""the hobbit"" isn't that.

In addition to the content from the book is other worldly events occurring alongside the hobbit's tale, presented as prelude to the fantastic The Lord of the Rings film series.<br/><br/>The film excels in technical achievements. This film is presented in 48 frames per second for select theaters. This new format for film is subtly different. The motion is smoother and makes the 3D format bearable. The screen is well lit, and the 3D process is not distracting. It does little for the film itself, but it is exciting to see a new format with obvious benefits. The photography and set design is mesmerising. Every location is beautiful. Every set is finely detailed. Middle-Earth looks beautiful. Unfortunately, some of the gorgeous scenes are deteriorated by post-production. There is an inordinate amount of CGI in this film. Certainly much more than its predecessor, and certainly much more than this year's The Dark Knight Rises. This creates a world that is less real, more abstract, and more requiring of a suspension of disbelief. Where once was prosthetic makeup, now a computer graphic replaces a great goblin's face.<br/><br/>The acting in this film varies wildly. The two stars, Martin Freeman as the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf, are as good as ever. Freeman's performance gives a strong personality to the main character, even if his screen time is really relatively short. McKellen presents his Gandalf with far more mystery than that seen in The Lord of the Rings. With his top notch performance, he is the carrier of this film. Richard Armitage's Thorin is another noteworthy performance, although sometimes he is perhaps too callous and thoughtless to be believable, and occasionally a tad bit over the top. One last performance worth mentioning is the hammy and ridiculous rendition of the brown wizard Radagast by Sylvester McCoy. It's unfortunate that a figure deemed to be wise and powerful is made into a comic numbskull of no importance.<br/><br/>With plenty of interesting characters, the film falls flat on what it decides to do with them. The characters, including Bilbo, are just there. Any attempts to develop them are quite futile. Bilbo discovers his inner courage. Thorin learns to not judge books by their covers. It is all so elementary. There is no criticism for these developments. There is only criticism for the fact that these developments don't mean much. There could've been more depth to these faces, but there isn't. Perhaps the great exception is the relationship between Gollum and Bilbo, in which Bilbo shows mercy for the beast when he has the opportunity to kill him. Still it is a wonder what the writers were going for. Perhaps some kind of 'kill only when necessary' thing, though the heroes seem to have no remorse for killing orcs. Orcs have no feelings anyways.<br/><br/>So the actual Hobbit story is pretty good. It's unfortunate that there is more than just this simple Hobbit story in the actual movie. There is a subplot of a rather ridiculous orc villain with such a clichéd villain trope that it seems unreal. Also there is the dark and mysterious Necromancer, yet another villain introduced to the series. These are really nothing more than distractions adding to the films length. Sometimes, especially when in relation to the Necromancer, the cuts away from the main story can be so long and over-dramatic you forget what the film is actually about. Perhaps the editor was sick or something. Considering the title, The Hobbit, it is astonishing to see so little of the hobbit.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey is a really nice Christmas film. It is fun and entertaining and nothing more. Those who want more have already gotten that from the book anyways."

","I was so incredibly pleased with The Hobbit!! I was completely entranced and delighted the entire movie, I couldn't stop smiling my head off 'cause I was so happy! It was awesome! Seriously, after seeing this, I'm still giddy the next morning with delight at how good it was!<br/><br/>I loved how they brought in stuff from the rest of Tolkien's writings to give even more back story and depth. I know some people have complained about it being split into 3 parts, but honestly I wish all movies were done like this, without rushing through anything! If there was enough story for them to make 5 movies from it, I'd say go for it! None of the stuff added to the book The Hobbit was filler -- it was all back story and/or stuff that happened in the time frame of The Hobbit that Tolkien wrote.<br/><br/>Also, I really liked the 48FPS! Everything was SO smooth, even the fast shots! And the 3D was used to make it look incredible without a bunch of useless 3D stuff thrown in simply for effect. And IMAX is awesome. And most of all, this movie was just absolutely incredible!"

","I was very taken aback, as well as disappointed, at the many negative reviews coming from critics. It did seem, however, that most of the negative reviews revolved around a couple of key point: the technology, and the pacing. <br/><br/>Quite simply, all I can say is that critics can be very wrong, and The Hobbit is truly a great film, continuing Peter Jacksons addition to the Middle Earth legacy.<br/><br/>Technology-wise, the use of HFR (48 frames per second) was, as many have said, unusual to begin with. However, after around ten minutes you barely register the difference, and it just adds a huge level of depth and immersion not capable in 24fps. The heavier CGI use compared to LotR, which admittedly worried me a lot, also turned out to be absolutely fine as well. If anything, it reflects the more wonderful and light tone of the Hobbit book.<br/><br/>In terms of pacing, all I can say is that there is a fairly long introduction to the film, including the scenes in The Shire. This is in no way a bad thing; we are being introduced to the start of a three-part epic trilogy, and to anyone who enjoyed LotR, they will only find this an enjoyable experience, rather than tedious as some critics have said. As far as I can see, PJ has been given even more freedom this time round due to the success of LotR, so has essentially released an extended edition in the cinema.<br/><br/>I don't need to say, but the characterisation, set pieces, action and storytelling is typically amazing. <br/><br/>So, there really is nothing to worry about, a great film. Just don't expect it to be LotR; its a little more light-hearted, and not QUITE as strong, although very close. I can only assume a lot of the critics are trying to be edgy, hipster, whatever, by panning what will obviously be a hugely successful, influential, and above all loved film."
"shannen-leigh-murphy","10","9","22","14 December 2012"," Exactly what it needed to be.
","It's been an Age or two since I saw a Tolkien film for the first time -- I was last about ten or so. I never had the pleasure of seeing the Ring trilogy in theater's, much less at a midnight premier, but tonight was going to be full of unexpected pleasures anyhow.<br/><br/>Sitting in the theatre and hearing Ian Holm's opening narration was like coming home.<br/><br/>While the prologue was a little slow in the telling, from the moment Bilbo says, ""In a hole in the ground, there live a hobbit..."" I was spellbound. I actually moved up several rows in the theatre to better immerse myself in Middle-Earth, and my popcorn lay forgotten to one side. Once again, Peter Jackson's direction brought the story to life in ways I had only hoped for.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it begins slowly, and the Radagast sequence did not so much build tension as it did slow the movie down, I deeply appreciate the glimpses we got of the White Council, and the Necromancer plot line in general. Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Sir Christopher Lee once again exude power -- especially Blanchett, who sends shivers up the spine with the control she has even over one of the Istari. Her minutes on film were far too brief.<br/><br/>Speaking of acting, Martin Freeman's Bilbo is flawless. I cannot begin to describe how much the little hero endears me to him. While he perhaps has a more combative role in the films than in the original books, one of my favorite moments is when he stands before Azog the Defiler and silently guards Thorin. It's beautifully shot, but it's the grim determination in Freeman's gaze that truly sells it.<br/><br/>Also much appreciated is the extensive use of Tolkien's songs in the film. ""Far Over the Misty Mountains..."" made me tear up in the theatre, and I will be shocked and deeply offended if the score does not at least get nominated for an Oscar this year. The film's variation on the ""Concerning Hobbits"" from the trilogy did not go unnoticed, and was also wonderful.<br/><br/>Pacing is probably this film's only flaw. The acting, cinematography, and continued references to the history of Middle-Earth were all spot on, and there was not a single omission of information. I once again have fallen in love with the 'verse that shaped much of childhood, and will be forever thankful for Mr. Jackson's films once again."

The movie did have a 1990s feel.<br/><br/>(3) A three hour sausage fest. Hundred males of all sizes, creed, and beard lengths occupy the bulk of the film.

"arsalankazemian","8","6","13","19 January 2013"," A joy to watch
","I'm a big fan of Tolkien and I am really glad to see the Hobbit on the screen; nonetheless, I have to say turning the Hobbit into a trilogy is not a flawless idea. I believe two films would have been much better. Jackson made the right decision to connect the Hobbit story to the long war of Dwarfs and Orcs and the background Middle-earth story of the White Council and the appearance of Necromancer/Sauron in Dol Goldur. Even with this rich background story,two films would have done justice. And for big fans, like me, the fine, excellent bits could find their way in the extended editions. You finish the Unexpected Journey and you find that you haven't reached the 100th page in the Hobbit book. No line has been missed. <br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM HERE<br/><br/>Though boring to some, telling all the details had its interests for many, including me. The prologue about Smaug's attack on Dale, the White Council in Rivendell, Radagast's visit to Dol Goldur and Bilbo's game of riddles with Gollum, which I think was the shining spot of the film. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis stand out in the whole film. The acting was great, but except for Thorin and Balin, the rest of the Dwarfs lacked any depth in character. The music and the scenery were great too, as expected. <br/><br/>SPOILERS ENDED<br/><br/>In short, I think all the Tolkien fans and all those who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings films would like the Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey, though they should not expect an epic as grand as LOtR."

","Watching this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. After LOTR, coming up with anything even close to it, seemed a gargantuan task, even for Peter Jackson! The book Hobbit doesn't give much scope to make it as epic as LOTR. But After watching The Hobbit, I realised i was wrong to compare the movies. LOTR was dark, brooding, everything leading to the final war for the Ring. Hobbit, on the other hand, is so much more about Bilbo Baggins. Its about how a half-ling faces everything. A bunch of dwarfs led by their displaced king. Gandalf leading them all to an adventure, whose larger purpose he doesn't yet understand. It all seems to fit in when u think of it in a larger perspective. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is fabulous! I dint think anybody could look more a Hobbit than Elijah as Frodo, but i was surprised! Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the brooding leader of the Dwarfs was amazing too! But this movie is not all about the ring or the story of the dwarfs or even Bilbo. Its about so much more. The cinematography is beautiful. The CGI is fantastic! The best part about the movie though, I felt was the music! Song of the Lonely Mountain and Far Over the Misty Mountain the song of the dwarfs leaves an impression like none another! A solid 9 pointer!"
"Spritedude23","9","6","13","9 January 2013"," A long-expected success!
","After a fall of underwhelming cinematic fare, I had long-anticipated a film that would condone going to the theaters. Fortunately, one existed. In the crisp mid-December chill, we were invited to return to Middle Earth after a 9-year break. Yes, I thought to myself, this film will be truly epic. A newcomer to the Lord of the Rings franchise, I had spent the last year procuring copies of and rabidly watching the original trilogy. None of these titles disappointed, whether it was the character-driven Fellowship of the Ring or the darker war-film The Two Towers or the emotional and triumphant Return of the King each film proved to be epic. So after watching the trailer for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey thirty somewhat times, I was ready for another classic film.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Peter Jackson delivered this time abet a few flaws in the film's pacing. I was treated to a rich, touching adventure in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien with some memorable characters and intense action pieces. The reason why I say some memorable characters is due to the immense supporting cast. We had Gandalf the Grey: wise and wisecracking, Bilbo Baggins: Reluctant but eventually develops beautifully, Thorin Oakenshield: The stoic and solemn leader of the party and 12 other dwarfs who never got enough screen-time. We'll probably see a lot more of them in future movies, but I never bothered to learn all of their names, they were just uncharacteristic faces that made up their company, and some of them could fight well I hate to be a nitpicker but that was my major quim with the film.<br/><br/>Other than the underwhelming Dwarfs, I found the movie quite enjoyable and found that the Production Design really was given the chance to shine here. We had some fantastic costumes, ranging from the elegant and proud Elrond to the paranoid and silly Radagast. Taking a page from the previous trilogy, the costume designers really just had to get back into their old mindset and think like they did ten years ago. The hobbits still wear periodic corduroy suits with bare over-large hairy feet and the dwarfs still have extravagant beards. But it doesn't stop there, the film is shot, once again, on location in New Zealand, hobbit-holes and all. This really added to the feel of the film, bringing Middle Earth to life with magnificent locations and a truly epic feel. When the crew wasn't fighting mountain trolls or evading a swarm of angry goblins they were trekking up the Misty Mountains to a truly magnificent score written by Howard Shore.<br/><br/>As far as the acting was concerned, this movie truly delivered. Martin Freeman was the perfect Bilbo Baggins, he came off exactly as I pictured him when I read the book in the 5th grade. The audience really fell in love with him in the beginning of the film when he had the conversation with Gandalf about the ""Good Morning."" It was then that I decided that he really was perfect for the role. Which brings me to another actor, Ian Mckellen was once again a show-stealer as Gandalf. The scenes where he isn't shown are never quite as good as he is more or less one of the icons of the entire franchise as a whole.<br/><br/>By far the greatest scene in the film was the infamous ""Riddles in the Dark"" where Bilbo falls down into a cave and encounters the creature Gollum, who is obsessed with the Ring of Power, but still really playful. There, Bilbo has a game of riddles with Gollum, putting his life on the line in exchange for the way to escape the Goblin Cavern. When Bilbo finds the ring and the theme from the past movies is played, I got chills. And Andy Shirkis as Gollum is and has always been a delight. Gollum is a really interesting character, he has two personalities to him, the Murderous and conniving Gollum and Sméagol the friendly character who wants to play games and help hobbitses. This scene really embodies the film as a whole: playful, but dangerous and it shows that Peter Jackson is still very capable of directing this fantastic series.<br/><br/>As a whole, this movie did not disappoint, sure it was different than the other movies, but it's supposed to be The Hobbit was written for little kids! It still has Peter Jackson's DNA coursing through its legendary veins.<br/><br/>4 ½ stars (out of 5)"
"vriesspeech","9","6","13","7 January 2013"," Peter Jackson has done it again!
","I personally think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the epitome of film-making of the last 10 years. For three consecutive years, I turned myself in a rabid fanboy of everything LOTR, source literature included. I was delighted to find out that Peter Jackson had taken it upon himself to turn the prequel of LOTR, The Hobbit, into a new trilogy. I was a bit sceptical at first, but I have to say, Jackson has done it again. The Hobbit is a marvellous fantasy movie of epic proportions that could only have been made by Jackson and the likes.<br/><br/>In short, I thought The Hobbit was absolutely spectacular. Every single frame, every location and every character has been brought to life with such imagination and love for the source material. The movie looks fantastic from beginning to end. I saw it in HFR 3D and although I found the viewing experience a bit jarring at first, it grew on me very quickly and I was completely accustomed to it after an hour. Everything is smooth and the HFR effect is definitely noticeable during action scenes with a lot of panning movement from the camera. Sometimes I even forgot I was looking at a movie. The 3D was also implemented very well. Subtle at times, but engrossing when it needed to be. Viewing The Hobbit is a mesmerising experience and I was entranced all the way through. The Hobbit definitely feels different from LOTR. The focus of the story is on the 13 dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf who set out on a quest to reclaim a treasure that was taken from the Dwarfs by the dragon Smaug, who destroyed their hometown in the process. It is a different scale from that of LOTR, in which entire Middle Earth was at war with Sauron and the fate of every race depended on the outcome of Frodo's journey. However, The Hobbit doesn't feel any less epic. Jackson took some liberty with the source material and added characters that are only present in other Tolkien stories, or he added scenes himself completely. The story takes a lot of time to get going, but I felt that every scene needed to be in the movie and some minor pacing issues aside, the story in The Hobbit is a fantastic ride from start to finish. Seeing some characters reprise their roles from LOTR felt like welcoming an old friend.<br/><br/>Another compliment flies out to Howard Shore, who once again outdid himself with the composition of the soundtrack. It was nice to hear some themes make a welcome return and the new main theme is nothing short of epic and bombastic and it returned a lot of times during the movie, be it in a lot of different renditions. I found the soundtrack to be a bit less memorable than the one in LOTR, but I loved it nonetheless. It even makes for some nice listening outside of the movie. The soundtrack should be an instant buy for anyone who enjoyed the music of Shore in the LOTR films.<br/><br/>All in all I find it hard to fault The Hobbit in any way, shape or form. If I had to name one negative remark about the movie it would have to be that I think that the fellowship of Dwarfs could have been fleshed out better. We only really get to know Thorin Oakenshield. It is even hard to remember the names of the other 12 dwarfs, they are mostly just along for the ride. I massively enjoyed myself during the entire duration of the movie. I felt something I hadn't felt since The Retun of the King in 2003 - a sense of utter bewilderment, amazed by the things that are shown to you on screen. A feeling of adventure that marks the years of our youth. The Hobbit is an accomplishment of rare proportions and I will be there next year for The Desolation of Smaug and the year after that for There and Back Again. I absolutely can't wait."

","Watching the Hobbit : unexpected journey was like a reunion. Saw the Hobbits village, their unique house, Frodo, Gandalf and.. Gollum. I can't believe I can still see them again, in a new story. for me LOTR series was ended in third movie. I remember how sad I am to see the story had finished. <br/><br/>From the Hobbit, we will know why the ring was with Bilbo, why Gollum act like a jerk and how much he loved that 'ring'. The story started in one fine morning, Bilbo was sit in his terrace, enjoying his pipe after a nice breakfast. Suddenly Gandalf came and ask Bilbo whether he was still recognized him or not. At first Bilbo didn't remember, then find out where he was meet Gandalf. He asked Bilbo to follow him in a journey. Bilbo refused, he said a good life for a hobbit is a warm bed, nice food, adequate snack. Adventure was not suitable for a tiny hobbit. Gandalf said, OK, fine. But he marked Bilbo's door house, in some kind of sign. At the evening when Bilbo just finished cooked his dinner, a delicious fish, suddenly he heard that his door was knocked. He wondered, in fact he didn't expect a guess. Bilbo saw a dwarf, and the dwarf asked did the party start yet? where's the others? where's the food? as he saw Bilbo food, he ate it and asked him whether he has more or not.<br/><br/>Shockingly, Bilbo said, do I know you? but again, his door knocked, group of dwarfs came and ask food. Helpless, Bilbo gave them food, but that was not enough, they mess around and took Bilbo's food supplies. The situation was messy and merry. Gandalf appeared and explained that those dwarf gather now to take over their homeland which was taken by a dragon. That dragon live in the palace, which filled with gold, golden coin. They need a thief to infiltrate silently to their kingdom. They need Bilbo, as he was small and others tend not to realized his existence. at first Bilbo refused but at the end he's accept and traveled with dwarfs to their taken over kingdom. In the middle of their journey, they found many obstacles, as dwarfs are small like hobbit, weak, and has no power like a wizard, strong like a orc, and have integrity like Elf. But their willingness to live in their land, beat them all. they almost eaten by troll, death in the amidst of 'stone war', killed by orc, with the integrity of Bilbo, help from Gandalf, their unity and cooperation, they can beat them all. Do they succeed won the war? As this movie trilogy, I guess we will get the answer.. next year!<br/><br/>if you are LOTR watchers, you will be familiar with the scenery. Till this day, it's still mesmerize me and wonder does this view really exist on earth? Peter Jackson is a brilliant director. If you are fans of LOTR, love an exquisite sight, an imaginary fellow and love to see something beyond imagination, please, please, watch this movie! I gave 9 because up to now, still curious, why Gandalf not getting younger? All of the people in Hobbit which we know them first in LOTR is getting younger. As I watched behind the scenes of the hobby, how details and serious them working on this movie, there is no way they missed this fact. then why?"
"DarthVoorhees","5","6","13","2 January 2013"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey or Thorin Oakenshield Part I
","Peter Jackson and company get an awful lot right here but the first part of his epic 'Hobbit' adaptation is largely an overblown mess. The flaws of his 'Rings' adaptations are ultra prevalent here. What we get here is an over complicated and thematically schizophrenic mess. <br/><br/>My first and chief complaint here is that Peter Jackson does not care about Bilbo Baggins or the Hobbits as characters. It was evident in his 'Rings' films but it is made all the more clear here. Jackson misses having the character of Aragorn and his quest to become king so much that he has planted the same seeds in the character of Thorin Oakenshield. Bilbo is largely a prop being brought along for the ride here. The 'Rings' films placed more thematic weight on Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn than Frodo and the ring. Of course this is completely against Tolkien's intent. Tolkien wanted us to appreciate the fact that the hobbits became heroes not through being great warriors but by being brave and facing perils that were beyond them. 'The Hobbit' is Bilbo's story and far too much time was spent talking in battles centered around Thorin Oakenshield and his warrior dwarfs. Allusions are made toward Oakenshield taking the dwarf throne and I found myself saying really? That story was told before and it does not need to be told again. In the 'Rings' trilogy the ascension of Aragorn has weight and is a part of Tolkien's narrative but that it is because 'Rings' is an ensemble piece, 'The Hobbit' isn't. It is 'Bilbo's story. And it is really too bad too because one thing Jackson nails is his casting of Martin Freeman, who is utterly spectacular as Bilbo. He hits all the right notes and can do the comedy and innocence needed for the character. Gone is the fairy tale aspect of 'The Hobbit'. Jackson wants an action film and Tolkien's book doesn't provide one for him.<br/><br/>'The Hobbit' is a visually very ugly picture too. The camera work is too fast to the point where the action sequences are painful to watch to the eye. I was brought back to Michael Bay's Transformers in that there is no sense of grounding in the action scenes. I can't tell who was fighting who and since they happen so often it is just disappointing. One thing I admired very much about the 'Rings' trilogy was the seamless practical effects transitioning into grand computer generated effects. 'The Hobbit' for the most part has abandoned this and we get C.G overkill. There are Orcs and Goblins here that look like cousins of Jar Jar Binks.<br/><br/>There are things to like here. For those concerned about the three hour run time for less than a quarter of Tolkien's children's novel than they need not be concerned. Jackson for the most part uses his narrative efficiently enough and develops mythos. I would have wished more of it would have been used to develop Bilbo or the supporting dwarfs instead of long drawn out batt.les. I like some of the appendices additions, Christopher Lee has a brilliant supporting role as Saruman. The beginning of the film that introduces Bilbo and the shire and the adventure is brilliant as Freeman plays the innocent Bilbo perfectly. As the story progresses though it moves into familiar waters which don't do anything interesting. The stuff about the Necromancer and Sauron for the most part is unnecessary however. That story and mythology was sufficiently dealt with and since this is a prequel we know where that road ends. Middle Earth is more than just the story of Sauron and his ring."
"torfarrells","7","6","13","27 December 2012"," Pretty good, but expected more.
","I do admit, I had high expectations for this movie. I just finished the book as it released. I loved the mythology in this movie. I loved the action sequences and the visual experience. I especially enjoyed the escape from the goblin dungeon scene. Now, this movie was just too long and slow. The scene in which the dwarfs unexpectedly arrive at Bilbo's house goes on for 20 minutes. The orcs also were made a little too creepy for my taste. This also does not entirely follow the book. In this, Azog the giant pale orc returns and tries to kill Thorin and Bilbo. In the book, he is mentioned in the past but not in the present. There is also a scene in the movie in which there is a big conversation about a creature called a nercromancer, who can bring up the dead. This is obliquely mentioned in the book, and becomes a threat in the movie. I also found that the film makers went out of there way to not be able to see the evil dragon Smaug. I also have to say, that Martin Freeman, who plays Bilbo was fantastic. It was hard for me to understand what gollum was saying when we meet him. I did enjoy the ending scene, in which they are saved by giant eagles. In the book, Thorin does not have anything against Bilbo, and he never is seriously injured. In the movie, he hates Bilbo, and is crunched on by a gigantic wolf, called wargs. I did like seeing Frodo at the beginning of the movie. This movie also had bad luck. It was before lord of the rings but the movie came out after. Maybe i would of liked more, knowing Lord of the Rings was next. I also did not enjoy some of the dwarfs. Some were funny, strong and good acting, some were useless. Gandalf was great as usual, and I liked how they managed to put in Galadriel and Saruman, who in the lord of the rings, turns evil.

","ABOUT THE FILMS MAKING. seen as Jackson said the hobbit would be in 2parts as its such a big book. and then he puts the behind the scenes making of on you-tube to watch for months and years. and during the videos says its 2parts and says its 2part many times during filming and talking to Gandalf. and IMDb had it down as 2 parts but then ooh wait lets spin it out for more cash<br/><br/>***spoiler***<br/><br/>ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF. well seen as its a few years on I'm never a fan of prequels<br/><br/>CAST. most of them look good Cate is stunning but fro do just looks to old now BOO<br/><br/>as for the new comers well young Bilbo i wasn't n still not sure of freeman was good with his voice but just looks nothing like Bilbo and its hard to let go of but watching he was good just i didn't like the way they play his character as a complete old man and a bit of a loser. as for Kili Billy Oin Gloin Boing and what ever the hell they are all called a cast of 13dwarfs is never gonna work and its fullish directing and foolish to stick them all in and keep to the book like that. with so many faces in one spot with fat suits on i couldn't pick one of them out to watch during scenes of course close ups of faces and yes you spot Nesbitt (yuk why would you wanna) and Adim Brown... wait who yes no clue who he was but you can see his real face so easy its just bad they are meant to be dwarfs not men. a few more faces in there and some good actors but all in one screen mixed up i couldn't pick them out of a line up. at least with fellowship you had a mix of elf dwarf human and can spot them but one huge rule of film and directing is if you can see all the characters and associate with them then you don't care about them and thats whats happening here i don't no them and don't care about them its just a group of blob shapes moving around the screen could be 11 of them or 15 i couldn't tell or pick one of them out unless its close up shots of them.<br/><br/>STORY. right so why is this set 20mins before the start of fellowship ?? i have no clue it just kicks of with a bit of a crap opening and we see Bilbo right but not try hold the ring in his pocket ??<br/><br/>and how do they link in the old footage now of Bilbo finding the ring ?? they have him find it in this movie so how does the fellowship footage work now did he lose it and then find it again lol ops not gonna work (""lets have c3pos memory wiped lol"" ""oh no r2 do something"").<br/><br/>there's no voice over start up or build up but rather into the film and have Bilbo read and tell us but its kinda strange that way.. then you have a cut back to 60years what is this an episode of dallas pfft. <br/><br/>cue gandalf just showing up at young bilbos house he just rocks up says he i need you to go on an adventure but he comes across ad an old creep and perv in that scene and i don't get why Bilbo ain't already friends with him.. for the sake of film i don't care if the book was done a set way books ain't films you always have to adjust and this made no sense to start of like this it felt rushed and silly.<br/><br/>the dwarfs all show up and eat stuff talk i still have no clue why they have all come together now and for what but hey I'm watching so its gonna tell me at some point I'm sure.... Bilbo says no I'm not going.... then Bilbo gets up runs after them ""I'm going on a trailer poster"" or something like that. they walk and walk and bore me with long stuff and then we find out some other back story i will point out i hate flashbacks then find out we have a bunch of white troll/goblin things after them. then some pointless bits we cut away to fill in some extra characters and of we go into more walking then catch up with other characters and then flash backs YAWNNN. then comes the trolls scene yeh its gonna be a cool fight cause gimli kicked ass but no its lame they are all lame and cant take down 1 single troll with a group of 14 but. gimli would have wrecked them in minutes alone. then bore me go see elves some old faces oks thats fine and little back story thats good but not great and then of they go again bump into more goblin people under ground and then of the go on a huge run again boring and back fighting the troll/goblin guys outside but its not action just running scenes over and over. then rescue by giant eagles yes fun cool but why do they drop them of just a few miles from the mountain that they are going to. it may have been a good idea in a book in the 30s but for film thats terrible and just no. <br/><br/>all in its kinda like T2 its the same but remade with very same style scenes walks action and just is not great at all. i couldn't care less about the dwarfs and they were the big draw to the film for me"

","Just my 2 cents. I was afraid to go see this. I reread the book in prep. Peter Jackson did a great job filling in the gaps and matching the tone of LOTR movies. The changes he made make total sense. I DID watch this in regular 24fps and non 3d. Don't think the bells and whistles are worth extra $ and I hate the soap opera effect! <br/><br/>It's a fun silly fantasy movie about wizards, elves, hobbits etc. I had a blast and can't wait for the next two.

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is here at last and it's worth its wait in gold, ten times over! It is unquestionably one of the greatest cinematic experiences ever, and a proud prequel to the equally consummate The Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>Spectacular beyond belief, this emotional and visceral visual flight of fantasy truly celebrates the art of storytelling and storymaking at its most enchanting and mesmerising.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is one of the most imaginative and gripping stories ever, and as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is what cinema and the art of filmmaking is all about.<br/><br/>It's astounding to think that one of the greatest stories ever told, brought to life by one of the greatest filmmaking teams in the world, sprung from the fertile imagination of Bloemfontein-born J.R.R. Tolkien – it is interesting that as a child Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider, which is echoed in The Hobbit. Also, the themes of personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story and along with motifs of warfare; these themes reflect Tolkien's own experiences during World War I.<br/><br/>And, NO, I am not going to reveal anything about The Hobbit's story; it will a deadly shame to ruin such a refined and illuminating experience.<br/><br/>What makes The Hobbit such an endearing and memorable journey, is that its magnificent and overwhelming epic grandeur, and gallant mythology are grounded in an astounding magic realism.<br/><br/>There are moments that take your breath away and willfully imprison your imagination, unlike anything you have experienced before.<br/><br/>Even if you are not a Lord of the Rings follower, you cannot deny its artistic merits and intelligent storytelling.<br/><br/>And if you experience The Hobbit fresh, without having read the book and still have some vivid recollections of The Lord of the Rings films, you will most definitely make a point of watching the entire saga all over again; this is one marathon you can look forward to.<br/><br/>One of the most charming aspects of The Hobbit is its characters; good or bad, meaningful or malevolent, each and every creation is unique and perfectly brought to life – from Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey, to 13 fortune-seeking dwarfs, the legendary Dwarf warrior Thorin Oakenshield, dragons, to giant spiders, hostile elves, ravenous wolves, and – perhaps the most perilous of all – a subterranean creature named Gollum, they are all magnificent in both performance and realisation.<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson's passion deserves every award bestowed on him and his team, particularly his dynamic co-screen writing team of Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, his fellow Oscar-winning co-writers on The Lord of the Rings films, along with Guillermo del Toro.<br/><br/>They pieced material together an additional treasure trove of material from a revered English writer, professor and philologist developed in the decades after The Hobbit was first published, as well as 125 pages of appendices at the end of The Lord of the Rings which provided more back-story to the history of Middle-earth, describing some of the politics and events that occur during the years pertaining to The Hobbit and was more serious, darker in tone, and more in line with The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Although there are moments of pure terror, its nightmarish horror never offends or becomes overbearing; the dark forces of antagonism become a worthy opponent in the warzone for supremacy.<br/><br/>Another great aspect of The Hobbit is that it underlines an important message during a time of war and dispute; and shows that home is indeed where the heart is and that outside familiar comfort zones, there lies an adventure that challenges the endurance of the human spirit and ultimately reveals our true humanity.<br/><br/>The Hobbit also shines a beacon of hope for outsiders who grow up in a shadow of destitute and loneliness, showing that friendship can be found in the most unlikely of places and that it can indeed make the world a better and more peaceful kingdom for all to share and rejoice in."

","Once again the idiotic critics and members of the public who think they are great by putting down big blockbuster movies are so far out with their judgement of this film. If you do not like fantasy adventure films then don't judge it, your opinion is meaningless.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the 48fps version, only the basic 3D version, so I cannot comment on the TV like film quality that has been reported, the quality of what I did see was great but I must say the 3D didn't add much to the film and I am a fan of 3D so do not expect too much from it.<br/><br/>So let's address the major issue people seem to have with this film, it's far too long. Yes it is long, yet none of it feels like it was out of place or did not drive the film forwards. I did leave the cinema feeling quite worn out and I do have to be honest, just before the end of it, I was preparing to go, which is a clear sign that i'd had enough and was ready to go. It is a film that must be experienced on the big screen, so unfortunately you have to take the rough with the smooth but it is a small price to pay for such an epic adventure. If I was to have one criticism it would be that there was a little bit of repetition with the fight scenes, they usually began with someone in trouble and just as they are about to meet their end 'AH HAAA!' The dwarfs jump in to the rescue, it appeared to happen quite a lot but I'm sure when I watch it again it will probably not be as bad as I recalled. I also found Gandalf shouted 'Run' quite often, since most of the film is spent running I would have thought Gandalf would have guessed that they get the idea by now. These are minor niggles and nothing that can have an effect on my 9 star rating. The only reason it didn't get a 10 is that Lord of the Rings so far for me just had an increased amount of tension drawing me in more so I couldn't justify rating it alongside a perfect trilogy....yet.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman was absolutely flawless as Bilbo and brings so much to the character. The dwarfs were all likable in their own way, it was great to see Gandalf back in action. Gollum was great as to be expected. Howard Shore's epic score is incredible and creates yet another heroic memorable theme, adding excitement to even basic chase scenes with not much going on.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has done the series proud and once again delivered a wonderful adventure with jaw dropping visuals and action sequences. If you have read the book then you know that it's going to get darker and a lot more traumatic, the best is yet to come."
"SeamusMacDuff","7","8","19","22 December 2012"," An Unrequired Epic
","I am a longtime Tolkien fan who likely read most of his works before most of the posters here were born. Peter Jackson did an absolutely superb job bringing LOTR to the screen, due in large part to sticking very closely to Tolkien's work. (Okay, Arwen got inserted to provide a love interest, but she replaced Glorfindel in part.) And while LOTR may be both my favorite novel and film, I wouldn't say I'm a Jackson/Tolkien fanboy as many here appear to be with their 10 of 10 scores.<br/><br/>Given the success of LOTR by sticking to the story, I was nervous when I heard The Hobbit would also be a trilogy. Show me the money! The Hobbit is shorter than any of the 3 LOTR volumes. More importantly, it's told in an entirely different way. The Hobbit is a fairy tale, told breezily with large sections of narration. Its dwarfs are largely comical. LOTR though is an epic, deep in setting, detail, and dialogue. Still, because of the breeziness (e.g. important events are covered in a few pages, the narrator intentionally skipping forward intentionally in some places) I had hopes that Jackson's understanding of Tolkien would compensate.<br/><br/>Did he? I must say, a mixed bag there. Certainly borrowing the settings, cinematography, tone, music, etc. from LOTR helped. Freeman's Bilbo matches Tolkien's pretty well, a simple fellow thrown into an adventure. The initial scene with the history of Smaug was a good way to give context to what follows. Whenever Jackson is sticking with Tolkien, things are great such as Gollum's scene.<br/><br/>When Jackson is on his own though, the film drags. Jackson had to mine every reference and back story for additional screen time. It's safe to say than when a character not in the book is on screen, something ain't right. Radagast, Galadriel, Saruman, and CGI Azog add little. Moreover, the battle scenes are excessive in the extreme. In the book, there as no fight with the trolls nor with orcs approaching Rivendell. The ""main"" fight with the Great Goblin was over pretty quickly, with the dwarfs needing to flee rather than fight. That all 14 continuously and miraculously escape unharmed from multiple situations drains all the drama. (Just the fall into Goblintown should have killed them all.) But Jackson has to have his CGI/video game fun, even though this too is filler.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hobbit is not a bad film. Go see it. But it would have been better had Jackson told the tale it in just two films, sticking to Tolkien and thus the success formula for LOTR."

","Sometimes I get the feeling that professional critics want something to fail. Sometimes I think they enforce the idiom 'pride comes before a fall', and want previous successes to be tempered by present failure.<br/><br/>That's what I think has happened here. Of all the reviews of this movie I've read at least half were negative, giving less than half the available marks.<br/><br/>Let me rectify this by saying I don't know how anyone can view this film and see it as anything other than the epic masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>Not only does Jackson wonderfully encompass the plot of 'The Hobbit', but he draws in further prose from Tolkien's wider collected writings to flesh out those portions of 'The Hobbit' that are only alluded to in the original children's book.<br/><br/>The sets, lighting, cinematography, CG work, dialogue, editing and plot are all extremely strong. After almost 3 hours I found myself wanting more.<br/><br/>Are we so spoiled we will see this visual wonder as anything but phenomenal? So jaded that we can look at this spectacle with indifference? So cynical as to say this magic is not worth the effort of sitting and looking?<br/><br/>To criticise a movie this excellent and of this scale and granduer as much as certain critics have is simply disingenuous. This is evidenced by the box office results - the public clearly have little respect for the critics and until they are more honest in their criticism they will find their voices increasingly silent."

","OK, so it wasn't perfect. However, it was still a great film that did a great job of bringing ""The Hobbit"" to life. Yes, the Radagast scenes annoyed me, but I am willing to set them aside and look at the movie in the context of it being a TRILOGY. There are scenes in this movie that have been included with the sole purpose of setting the scene for the upcoming story lines that would inextricably link this trilogy to LOTR. Purists will deride the addition of extra scenes and characters that were not in ""The Hobbit"", or the ones that appeared in unexpected places in the film. My own opinion is that most of the scenes were nice additions. Only the Radagast scenes were poorly placed and poorly executed. They were the one blemish on an otherwise beautiful canvas. I am going to believe, however, that even those scenes will be vindicated upon presentation of the other two films. The pacing was a little choppy in the beginning, but it improved as the film went on. Not everything is exactly as it was in the book, but the liberties taken were mostly harmless and some even improved the story. I am really looking forward to the next two installments. I am optimistic that everything will come together and that this entire trilogy will end up being the masterpiece that I truly hope it will be."
"InakiArias","9","8","19","15 December 2012"," Unexpectedly magical journey!!
","One of the main problems of the ""star wars"" latest trilogy was the difference in time between chapter VI and chapter I. The filmmaking was so different that it was hard getting into that universe again. This time, however, the things are quite different. From the beginning you have the nice sensation of coming back to the same middle-earth that your visited ten years ago.<br/><br/>Photography is great, setting is amazing, visuals are OK, not superb but they do the trick, costumes and makeup are outstanding and the sound and ost are top-notch. In those aspects everything is as fine as it was in the previous trilogy, but there are differences in the story itself and how it is told.<br/><br/>I have never read anything of Tolkien so I can't compare the movie with the book but I can tell you some differences between the first movie of this new trilogy and the old one. One of the things that bothered me of LOTR trilogy was that in such a magical environment, fantastic world, sometimes I found myself lost between so many hierarchical and aristocratic references. It was so ""medieval"", full of wars that, in my opinion, the story lacked of magic sometimes. In this one, from beginning to the end the entire movie is full of magic. It is so magical, fantastic, epic, funny, ridiculously entertaining... absolutely unforgivable.<br/><br/>Sincerely I think that director Peter Jackson have done what he wanted without restrictions. His filmmaking shares the same mistakes that he made in LOTR, but for me, at least, the direction seems more refreshing, more genuine... I can't explain properly but there is something different and better.<br/><br/>Following with the main character, the only thing I can say is that I love Bilbo Bolsom. A thousand time better that Frodo was, not just the character, the actor too. Martin Freeman makes a brilliant performance and he shows that he's better than Elijah Wood. Ian McEllen plays his best Gandalf (yes, Gandalf was actually a mage and not a mere swordsman!!) and about the dwarfs I just want you to see the movie and make your own opinion about them. I can't be objective, impossible.<br/><br/>In conclusion,the potential of the technical capabilities of our days, a marvelous story, and the magical direction by an inspired director create a totally amazing, classical masterpiece for all audiences. One of this year's movies and one of fantasy-adventure genre's best films of all-times.<br/><br/>One thing: if what you liked the most in LOTR were the never ending battles between large armies, the parts involving humans and their crown, nobility, succession matters or if you are the typical who just love the elves, their immortality, beauty, purity... probably you will find this movie disappointing."
"syrocc2004","10","8","19","15 December 2012"," So much better than the book
","Let me start by saying that I have read the books a long time ago (both the LotR series and the Hobbit), as well as a wide array from the fantasy genre. I do personally believe that authors like Terry Goodkind, R.A. Salvatore or Sapkowski wrote superior novels to those of Tolkien. However, Peter Jackson always had a way of making something good into something of legend.<br/><br/>And he outdid himself this time. I expected that the 2:49 hour long runtime would be a bit too long. Well, by the end of the film (this is a film, not a movie, nuff said), I was thinking ""what, it's already over?"". Beautiful landscapes, breathtaking cinematography (pretty sure it will receive a nomination for the Academy Awards this year), insanely well choreographed fight and action scenes, and a lot more than I can give praise too. <br/><br/>There is also a tendency toward humor, more so than in the LotR. I found it enjoyable, however, it might not be for everyone. Also, I have heard controversy about the 48 frame high-def version being unpleasant and a failure. I cannot comment on this, as I have seen the 24 frame version, in standard 3D, and couldn't find anything bothering about the way it was filmed. However, the polish of the CGI could have been better. It's not bad at all, but it did feel ""meh"" at times. Still, I personally think that CGI is hardly important when setting up atmosphere and telling a story, and there cannot be any complaints there. The costumes were great, and the soundtrack is far, FAR better than in the previous LotR titles (even though Howard Shore obviously reused some of the themes, altering and improving upon them).<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was top notch. I had no doubts that Ian McKellen would deliver, but I was pleasantly surprised by Martin Freeman. He does a vastly superior job compared to Elijah Wood. Richard Armitage and Ken Scott also deliver solid performances. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of them in the future following these roles.<br/><br/>Overall, my expectations were high, and I was not let down. I knew I would love The Hobbit, but I never expected it to be this good. Sure, we can nitpick some of its elements if we really wanted to, but overall, it is one of the best films Hollywood gave us in quite a few years, and you should not think twice about going to see it."

","If you are one of those people who are looking for another Lord of the Rings you will not find that in this movie. While it shares many of the same elements that the Lord of the Rings movies had it differs from it through tone. The Hobbit is a much less serious and dark than the Lord of the Rings was, so that constant intensity is not there. There are many intense scenes but they never quite get to the level that the Lord of the Rings had it at. Should you see the Hobbit? It is honestly a completely different experience than watching Lord of the Rings so if you like more intense dialogue and less of the action found in Lord of the Rings you will enjoy this movie. Last of all, I recommend not going to the 3D HFR (High Frame Rate) movie screening which I did as it puts strain on your eyes and just looks extremely odd."

I didn't watch this movie in an Imax, but now that I have watched it on DVD, I feel I should have gone to watch it. All I can say is that the movie may have seemed a bit slow at times, but the previous retarded critics and myself included forgot that the previous 3 movies were somewhat similar too. I am going with a 10/10 because some idiots have under-rated this movie.

","The Hobbit is very different from the LOTR (Lord of the Rings) trilogy. This is filled with humor that has the whole crowd laughing, where Lord of the Rings trilogy is more serious. Ian McKellan, Martin Freeman, and Andy Serkis star in this unexpected journey, where an ordinary hobbit of Bag End in the Shire is chosen as the 14th member of the dwarf family, so that they can go get their home back from the evil dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>Personally, my favorite scene of The Hobbit was when Bilbo Baggins has an encounter with the creature, who once was a hobbit, Gollum. ""We lost it! My precious, we lost it,"" Gollum says when he figures out that his ring (precious) is gone. This is a very fun scene because Gollum is so clumsy and very silly, as he is in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.<br/><br/>It's very hard to believe that the same actor that plays Gollum also portrays Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Kong in Peter Jackson's King Kong.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings, you should see The Hobbit!"

Oh how many times this gimmick can work. <br/><br/>Go under a mountain and everyone run away from Orcs that shoot arrows.

Just make sure that there is some sort of blow up a bridge type sequence theme type thing that leaves you on one side and the enemy on the other. Been there done that. What?!<br/><br/>Climb the mountain. Hey its just like Sam and Frodo did in the last movie. What do you know. Shouldn't Gandalf and that other evil version of Gandalf wizard be shooting magic rocks at each other. I never thought there could be such a thing as to much CGI. Now I know. There is. The rock giant sequence is just awkward and cheesy. The preview makes it look cool though. My god. It would have been more entertaining to actually see the actors playing make believe in front of a green screen. <br/><br/>Make sure at some point you stop by Elvendoor. Elf Disneyland, 7-11 elf land or whatever its called. Make sure at some point in the movie that happens. <br/><br/>Last but not least make sure you look ominously into the distance at mountain at the end of the movie. It has now been established as the franchise staple to be continued thing that they do. <br/><br/>Like I said.

","I Wasn't really exited about this movies since the second I heard they were making three of them, from ONE amazing book, then hearing it'll include other stories was too much for any purist J.R.R. Tolkien fan... how can something like that be any good? it'll be a mess and obviously nothing I'd get to enjoy at all.<br/><br/>Who'd knew I was wrong... The whole movie has the same magic brought in the original three Lord of the rings movies, the characters, old and new are just perfectly casted. seeing familiar faces, having almost exact quotes in the early scenes, hearing The Shire theme song again, it held and twisted my heart once more. it sounds emotional and subjective, but this movies, and the books for those who read them when young are emotional and subjective, so the second I heard the story of Erebor, Smaug, the Arkenstone and Thorin and Thrain and everything else it was just perfect, long time since I enjoyed a movie like I did with this one.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure there's no actual spoilers on a story this old, is like giving spoilers on Snow white... but even if I tell you every detail you'll find a million things to enjoy when watching this piece of art.<br/><br/>Once more we have a great cast of perfect nobodies, once more we have characters that are so different and embody the different races in middle earth in a way that having me wondering if Peter Jackson and his team has someone to get advise from.<br/><br/>The story is fast, there's always something happening, adventure and danger in every scene, strength and courage, lessons to learn just like that first time when you read the book. Is never boring and is never too much you have the time to soak in every detail and is like one fast visit, it last forever and one can't have enough. Sometimes they use lines right out of the book and it carries the book to you again. I could hear my sister's voice reading the trolls dialog.<br/><br/>Thorin's story, Richard Armitage was only Guy of Gisborne to me, from a Robin Hood TV Series a couple years ago, I never even payed attention to him aside of the fact that he was the only good actor on that show, and seeing him as Thorin Oakenshield was enough to bring memories of other times. Some dwarfs are well known too, Kili, from being Human, he's great, you can see how talented this kid is, Bofur was Jekill and he's also lost in his character, some of the older guys are funny and strong and so believable. I've heard complains of the dwarfs looking too Disney, to me they're perfect! if they keep doing them all Gimli like we couldn't point one from the other, this way is easier and better. There are pieces that are not from the original story,but I'm okay with it.<br/><br/>Extra points for the Music, if Howard Shore doesn't get an Oscar this time there's no justice in this world, Song of the Misty mountain is powerful and great and adds emotion to scenes where not one word is spoken yet you see feelings and changes. The other song at Bilbo's house was even better. All in all is a great first adventure if you've lived under a rock this last decade and have never seen the Lord of The Rings trilogy and is a great new adventure if you've enjoyed the first three.<br/><br/>One of the best movies ever, There's so much I'd like to convey in this review but my mind is clouded with sentiments and this weird innocent awe that seems to fill me, I was held by the hand the second Bilbo start with his ""My Dear Frodo.."" and dragged back to middle Earth where the last bit of my childhood resides.<br/><br/>I honestly hope you get to enjoy this movie half as much as I do, then you'll understand this ramble."
"seventiesfashion","10","7","16","17 January 2013"," A excellent movie with a few rough edges
","I have seen this movie twice, on opening night in IMAX 3D and again half a month later, again in IMAX 3D, and both times I have Been thrilled with nearly 3 hours of pure imagination, creativity and excellence. I actually would give it a 8.5/10, but I was so mad at reading all these untrue shitty reviews that I said 10/10 just to show them! It received many bad reviews, saying it was sluggish, boring and bloated, but I personally did not agree. If you had just seen The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, and then watched The Hobbit, without reading the books, I think you might feel that way, but My personal belief, and I understand you might feel differently, is that you have to really get into the essence of Middle Earth for this movie to be appreciated to its full potential. I also realize there are fans just of the books, and, like the Tolkiens, hate everything to do with the movies. My middle earth education began at four, I read the hobbit at 8 and the fellowship at 9, and I am learning elvish jut because I got the midnight premiere posters, so I have been a fan for over 2/3 of my life. Yes, I had one or two things that I felt could have been better, but it WAS a very excellent movie, just had a few rough edges, such as: 1. The goblin king's voice. Not nasty enough. 2. Thorin bugged me a bit sometimes, like when he fights Azog at the near-end. Dude, just get up and kick his ass already! 3. Sometimes Bilbo took the backseat. Jeez Bilbo, it's YOUR movie! I encourage you very strongly to see it for yourself. I also really enjoyed all the back story, and I thought it tied in a lot of stuff. At the risk of making a boring movie Peter Jackson wove together all the yarns and strings together to make one beautiful Purple Corduroy Coat Modeled by one homesick young Hobbit. I would probably see it for a third time, and I am most certainly going to the midnight premiere of the other two, in IMAX 3D, and buy the extended versions on DVD. So no more crappy reviews people!!!!!!"
"saribasak-223-253135","10","7","16","16 January 2013"," Unexpected Same Taste with a New Plot
","I will try to make a concise overview of the movie without analyzing it deeply and technically. First of all, I am a great fan of Hobbit and LOTR series. I read the books and saw the former movies in the movie theater probably more than three times each. In my last watch, I saw them all at once at one session which took my almost 10h straight from evening till morning with a horde of people inside a big theater in Munich Germany. <br/><br/>Well, that was 10 years ago. When I have read, there will be THE prequel to LOTR, I was quite excited since Sir Jackson will be sitting on the director chair once again and the same common players (like Gandalf by Ian McKellen) will be on the new movie as well. In the beginning, I thought it would be only one movie since Hobbit itself is the shortest of all the four books. Later it revealed to be two parts and finally just recently turned out to be three movies. I was a bit worried that Hobbit series would not TASTE like the previous ones since the thinnest book will be segmented into three parts. <br/><br/>Well, after I saw the Unexpected Journey, it left an UNEXPECTED positive impression on me and I hurried to the theater once again at the earliest possibility. In fact just a few hours ago, I saw it the second time and decided to write my ever first review in IMDb. To tell you the truth the movie is beyond any expectation. Congrats and thanks to Peter Jackson. The TASTE is even better than previous ones. In the new series which is like a PROTOTYPE of the older series (a new journey with a different purpose though), there is a deep feeling of mourning and sadness. You understand this better when you see it the second time. The theme song of the movie 'Misty Mountains' which became also the general SCORE of the entire movie is also UNEXPECTEDLY in HARMONY with the score of the LOTR series with a new TASTE though. This is a wonderful job, congrats to Howard Shore for the awesome score that I couldn't keep my eyes from the tear drops and my mouth from murmuring of the words of the song. The mourning in the movie probably comes from the state of Dwarfs that basically they are homeless and the new trilogy is about to claim their home back and of course THE introduction for the ONE RING of the RINGS. Of no doubt revealing of colleagues of Gandalf like Radagast as well as new creatures make the movie unique and different than former ones. <br/><br/>Overall it was an UNEXPECTED same experience and I recommend to everybody, newcomers as well as definitely to older fans. By the way for sure that I will see it the third time on the BIG SCREEN before it's gone.<br/><br/>One last thing, I may not aware of it but THERE HAS TO BE DEFINITELY A STORY FOR the ONE STONE, THE ARKENSTONE. Even Mr Jackson would picture a new world with different races which took place long before than HOBBITs, who used THE ARKENSTONE for different purposes. Anyway, I thought it would make a perfect SPIN-OFF to the movie or a PREQUEL to the HOBBIT."

The cast performances were great - with special mentions to Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, and newcomers Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage. Saw it in 3D HFR and the clarity is amazing - like being in the story. Looking forward to seeing it again next week. And I can't wait for Part 2 in December.

","I've only seen it in 24 fps so far. I'm never a big fan of 3-D movies, but I wouldn't mind seeing 2D 48 fps.<br/><br/>The orcs and goblins were much much much better in design than in LOTR. They were less gross and more monstrous in a very good way. They looked more like orcs and goblins.<br/><br/>The Wargs actually looked like Wargs instead of giant Hyenas. Thank you! Before this movie, I just never liked dwarfs... something about them I can't put a finger on. Well, Peter Jackson works magic and now I love many if not all of the dwarf characters in the movie. Really well done main and supporting characters.<br/><br/>Glimpses of Smaug were very well done indeed. The whole fire scene was to me the most exciting and terrifying dragon scene in a movie, hands down.<br/><br/>The thing that tied it all together was the incredible amount of heart the movie had.

"kerangador","10","7","16","5 January 2013"," I liked it
","I'm not too sure why there is so much hate for the Hobbit. Its clearly an adaptation of the book, not the actual book itself. And it also incorporates detail from the other stories written by Tolkien, ie. the growing sense that Saruman was going to be more of a hindrance than a help. Some people see it as a problem but I don't. B I have some problems with the film 1. the initial meeting with Gandalf seemed too weird. There didn't seem to be any reason why Bilbo should go running off with this tall messy looking stranger.<br/><br/>However on the 2nd screening (I watched it a 2nd time) this scene didn't seem so bad and I caught some of the casual explanations given.<br/><br/>2. Galadriel meeting with Gandalf. Was Gandalf so in awe of the Lady in the books? She seems to have taken on a ghostly Mother Mary sort of persona here.<br/><br/>3. Bilbo's capture which resulted in the surrender of the entire group. I don't exactly see why Thorin would lay down his sword and get eaten just to save Bilbo's life temporarily.<br/><br/>4. Some of the decapitation scenes of the goblins did not amuse me.<br/><br/>But overall it was an excellent film. There were some marvelous bits of drama for me.<br/><br/>1. Bilbo's explanation of why he didn't belong to the group, and later why he chose to stay with the group.<br/><br/>2. The appearance of the Eagles. Weta did an amazing work in this. Simply stunning to behold.<br/><br/>Some posters complained about Azog being ""resurrected"" to be the main antagonist. Gosh if that bothers you I think you are a book-wraith."
"lars_hendrikx","9","7","16","29 December 2012"," Small Beginnings
","A new movie about from the hand of Peter Jackson about the Hobbits, what a pleasure to see. I was too young to go see the Lord of the Rings movies in the cinema, but have seen them later (multiple times) and I thought that trilogy was one from outstanding excellency so I was eager to see how this one turned out.<br/><br/>The first thing I wondered was how Martin Freeman would do as Bilbo Baggins. The role I have seen him in, Watson in the Sherlock series, is naturally completely different. I was positively surprised. Freeman puts down an excellent Hobbit, scared at first to explore the wide world with a bunch of wild but noble dwarfs but evolving into a hero and companion. All the roles that have appeared in the LotR franchise are still excellent, Gandalf the Grey, Elrond, Galadriel and of course the creature Gollum(who was welcomed by the people in the cinema with me with cheering). The new characters that you meet in this movie stand strong against the already strong cast as well. The dwarfs in this companionship are fierce, funny and a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Once again, I take a deep bow for the effects and scenery in this movie. Everything is worked out in the finest detail, even the most minor details in the background. The landscapes are beautiful, the city of Erebor is beautiful and the underground mines with the countless rope bridges and the place Gollum resides look spectacular. <br/><br/>The storyline, while still not finished at the end of this movie, is of good quality, like we're used to from Tolkien. What I heard before watching this movie was that the story is stretched out way too much over the movie, people were saying they got bored because nothing was happening. I didn't get bored for the full 3 hours of the movie, which is a remarkable achievement by the director. <br/><br/>I welcome a new era of Hobbit movies and eagerly await the next 2 movies."
"sonicfan5715","8","7","16","28 December 2012"," The Hobbit does not deserve this hate!
","Why is this being hated upon so badly? I am a die-hard Lord of the Rings movie fan (and the Hobbit was the only book I read of Tolkeins LOTR novels!), I never read any of the books that inspired Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy. It seems that the Hobbit is being hated on by everyone, the bookworms who nitpick about every detail and change, and the movie critics who were used to the tone of the LOTR movies and hated the changes, even though there are still elements of the original trilogy here. And this is just part 1, part 2 will be much more serious and invoking than part 1, that's the way it is with trilogies usually: first film you get a look at the problem, a lighthearted or easy going intro to all the characters you'll come to love,then it just ups the ante from there on until the serious, epic, and emotional climax.<br/><br/>This film actually follows the book pretty well, perfectly at times, all with the exception of the additional scenes, like the conversation with Saruman and Lady (starts with G, can't spell), or the completely new (and admittedly too goofy) wood wizard and his rabbit sled... I will admit that was a little much. But this film makes up for it with a perfect interpretation of the Riddle scene with Gollum and Bilbo.<br/><br/>CGI is becoming a big part in cinema, and whether or not it's well integrated or realistic with the real people on set is up to the animators. The White orc is CGI animated as well, and this is very awkward to see at first, but towards the end of the film he starts to seem less fake. Gollum is AMAZING, more real, and creepier than ever. The troll scene was a touch silly, but it was meant to be that way from the book standpoint in my opinion, and the trolls looks very well done. And I'm glad at least some of the orcs/goblins are still people in make-up like the original films, they always looked great. But the majority of the goblins are Cg, including the incredibly bulbous Goblin King (who is well done in his own right, though his death didn't exactly follow the book, but it still worked). The change in design of the Wargs really bugged me at first, but the White Orcs white warg (tongue twist there for you, lol) was admittedly bad ass looking, and made up for it.<br/><br/>Characters are great too, Bilbo is done perfectly, Gandalf is awesome as always. The 12 dwarfs are a very lovable, yet mostly unidentifiable bunch, aside from characteristics (the fat one, the young dashing one, etc), outside of Thorin (perfect) and one or two more whose names escape me presently. And it was really nostalgic to see old faces like Frodo, Elrond, Saruman, and while not required, it was nice to see these characters at this point in time in the LOTR storyline.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil too much, but bottom line, it's a good fantasy film. Only problems I have with it is some of the silly moments, really large-ass subtitles when foreign tongues are spoken, and the inconsistency of the tone at times (which is pretty much why so many people punish it so) but it really makes up for it with the Riddle scene, how it flows along with the events in the book, great characters (both real and CGI), and in the second half of the film when it decides to stick with one tone, and hopefully the next parts will do better with this.<br/><br/>Definitely one of 2012's best, 8.5/10"
"jaqvaar","10","7","16","27 December 2012"," You need 3 movies to tell a short story?
","I took my son to see this as a Christmas treat for him. And discovered three things about the Hobbit I did not know before:<br/><br/>1) As expected, it was better than any of the LoTR films. This is partly because the technology has been developed in the last few years, partly because Jackson and his crew have done this before, and partly because, let's face it, the Hobbit was a better story to start with. At least when it comes to a fun, children-oriented fairytale.<br/><br/>2) 3D is not for people who already have 4 eyes, such as myself. It's OK if you wear contact lenses I guess, but it's impossible to fit the 3D glasses over or under your normal glasses and get a proper focus. The movie is long and I eventually got a headache and did not enjoy it as much as I would have. It was my second attempt at 3D, and I think it will be my last in the foreseeable future. So, if you wear glasses, go for the 2D version, which I am sure will be just as fun.<br/><br/>3) But the most amazing thing I discovered around 2 hours into the movie, when the heroes did not seem to be getting anywhere near their final objective, is that this is only 1/3 of the Hobbit story. It's going to be another trilogy! I'm sorry, but I cannot go once a year for 3 years in the hope of eventually watching the movie by 2015. Oh come on now! I could understand it when it comes to LoTR, which after all was a 1000-page book they had to bind in 3 tomes (which is why it has been mistaken for a trilogy). But the Hobbit is a much shorter, straightforward story. I'm sure they could have told it in 3-4 hours without chopping out any major parts. In fact, I'm pretty sure they added extra subplots to fill up the time.<br/><br/>But in any case, all in all I'll have to give this movie a 10, despite my own objections to the length and format. For what it is, it was brilliantly done, taking the viewer once more on a magnificent journey to Middle Earth. And, unlike the LotR movies (especially the last one), this one is family-friendly and can be easily watched by non-fans and children of all ages."

"BharatSamra","9","7","16","24 December 2012"," Truly an unexpected journey!
","It is not very often that a film's title encapsulates all it stands for. We truly are taken on an unexpected journey of wonder, and the most sensational fantasy ride the world of cinema has to offer. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is one of the few films this year, that just continues to get better as we embark on this phenomenal adventure.<br/><br/>After the first hour, we begin to suspect that the thrills we have just been witness to will come to an inevitable end, and the integrity of the film will exacerbate and become exhausted with time. Well that is what I anticipated anyway, and I could not have been more incorrect. Peter Jackson finds a exceptional balance between accommodating to The Lord of the Rings fans (which I admit I am not) and creating a new, fresh film franchise that will be just as memorable as the trilogy of the 2000s. There is a predictable nature of comparing The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings, and I won't try to do any differently as there are natural parallels and differences to be observed. First and foremost, the story is vaguely similar to The Fellowship of the Ring, in that a peaceful and I guess, underdog of a hobbit, is given the task of a greatly important quest that requires determination, loyalty and cooperation. Differently to the trilogy however, The Hobbit does not emphasise its key themes until we are close to the end of the ride and the brakes are seemingly being put down. Nonetheless, when the motifs of loyalty, pride and patriotism are revealed, there is no surprise or disappointment as they have been present all along, just not prevalently expressed as camaraderie is in The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>In all honesty, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is simply fun. You have fun when you are watching. Scratch that. When you are living it. You don't feel like a human sitting in a theatre watching a film, you feel so completely engaged in the story, the characters, and the world of Middle-Earth. I almost felt that after leaving the cinema, I just been brainwashed for 170 minutes because I was just taken into a land of utter amusement and inconceivable enjoyment, not just surpassing my expectations for the film, but making those very expectations feel ashamed they ever doubted the opening of the trilogy for a moment.<br/><br/>I feel no need to proclaim everything the film did right and fantastically because the list would be endless. It probably would be more appropriate to discuss my dislikes of which there are only two, but to discredit The Hobbit in written form in any way possible would be to seemingly decline my enthusiasm for the next two years of the franchise, so 'I shall not pass' negative judgement. <br/><br/>I was quite happily ready to regard The Dark Knight Rises as 2012s finest offeringof film (that I have seen), even in July. Now I am afraid that Christopher Nolan's incredible conclusion to a trilogy, has been replaced by this almost perfect opening to another, what I hope will end up as, magical in every sense of the word, trilogy, of its own. That may be the unexpectedness of my enjoyment of The Hobbit, and slight disappointment at the conclusion to Nolan's Batman talking, but nevertheless, I stand in saying that Peter Jackson has delivered the standout film of the year... so far of course, there are seven days left."
"kadergur","8","7","16","24 December 2012"," welcome back to the maGic of the Middle Earth!
","Sequel films are really intriguing for me and this was one of them. Especially after watching three LOTR movies it felt like amazing going into the very beginning after a long time. <br/><br/>I did not read the books and cant say that the adaptation is perfect but I mostly heard from readers it was quite fine. I will not read the books since after seeing a thing from someone's window of imagination, I guess it will be hard to make my own. Maybe I should read to see how it is going to be. But I can say that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is such a good movie like LOTR movies thanks to Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>The cast especially the choice of Bilbo Baggins is perfect., 13 dwarfs are worth to know and the scene that the old dwarf Balin was telling the story of how he believed in Thorin was quite impressive and makes the viewer to understand and feel why they want to get back their lost home Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor. But it would be little bit more hard for Bilbo to leave his warm and nice home with a relax couch to sit and read beside a fireplace in the amazing Shire but this is a book out movie and u have a certain time to tell the main things. And for me it is not obvious enough why Gandalf choose Bilbo Baggins for this journey. But in the beginning of the movie seeing Gandalf gives a big smile on your face and waiting for his appearance when there is almost no more hope in a battle is perfect like in all LOTR. Acquaintance phase of the ironic character Gollum and Bilbo Baggins was fun among the battle scenes. There are so many scenes I can count as""woow perfect"" or ""kind of boring"" but totally the movie was amazing and a must-see. <br/><br/>Now, need to watch the LOTR series again on DVD (this is a reminder for myself, make an empathy right now and after u watched please give them back to their owner!). Cant wait to see the sequels and to meet again with the fantastic world of Middle Earth."
"mikeymcdo","9","7","16","22 December 2012"," Should be called an Unappreciated Journey.
","Tolkien's bed time story is revamped in a more epic fashion with Peter Jacksons return to the stunning world of Middle Earth in The Hobbit, a tale of a secluded, comfort loving Bilbo Baggins who prefers his comfort loving home to the perils of adventure with his whole world turning upside down when the wizard Gandalf nudges him into a quest to help a group of dwarfs reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug. The story involves the fish out of water character of the reluctant hero Bilbo Baggins trying to find courage he never knew he had. We start with a party before the perils before moving on to encountering the good, the bad and the ugly the world of middle earth has to offer with a slash and dash approach of fighting then running away. <br/><br/>However, The Hobbit should be called an Unappreciated Journey then an Unexpected Journey because of its critical reception. Most of the backlash is unfair, with criticism's involving comparisons to Lord of the Rings and the drawn out narrative that is a slender children's book being divided into 3 movies. Comparing Lord of the Rings to The Hobbit is unfair surely anyone who is aware of the source material would know that, The Lord of the Rings isn't in the same league in a narrative level to The Hobbit. The Hobbit is the younger brother compared to the bolder older brother being the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In fact I thought some of the efforts to connect these 2 stories together were rather distracting with the inclusion of Frodo in the prologue, with ElijahWood delivering his 2 lines of dialogue, collecting his pay check then leaving. It seemed rather self indulgent and pointless. The looming threat of the Necromancer is intriguing however, adding a darker element to a relatively light-hearted journey making the decision of making these 3 films justified if executed correctly. These negative reactions only come off as minor gripes and shouldn't put anyone off watching this film. Jackson has created a true gem of a movie, with its delightfully charming cast of characters delivering brilliantly quirky performances. <br/><br/>Once again Andy Serkis steals the show as the schizophrenic Gollum despite being a feral creature of his forma self there is a real sense of attachment to his character with elements of morbid comedy in Serkis's performance. The Riddles in the Dark scene is defiantly the stand out moment of the film I've never known a game of wits could be so intense! Martin Freeman brings the beloved character of Bilbo Baggins to life with his funny facial expressions and quaint movement. His performance is very relatable much more so the the slightly dreary Frodo in the Lord of the Rings. Sir Ian McKellan provides an enigmatic and a cunningly powerful performance as Gandalf the Grey (which is far more interesting then Gandalf the White in my opinion.) Richard Armitage plays a ruff battle,hardened dwarf determined to reclaim his home from the dragon Smaug(who we only get a teasing glimpse of.) All these performances are stellar apart from the fact that some Dwarfs get more screen time than others but giving every dwarf a chance to stand out is hard amongst this bunch of characters which best works as a rugged team of Dwarfs. One performance that stood out too me as flat out bizarre would be Radagast the Brown and his frantic frolics in the woods with his bunny sled, it made me wonder if someone put LSD in my pepsi. The whimsy, wonder and peril of Howard Shore's Soundtrack also show the sheer range of the films gravitas which resembles the soundtrack of the Rings trilogy. <br/><br/>It's definitely worth going there and back again to your local cinema to witness the wonders of Middle Earth on the big screen despite the strenuous running time."
"ChristianUnchained","9","7","16","21 December 2012"," It's flawed, but tremendously entertaining
","The Short: Wonderfully cast, incredibly shot, relentlessly adventurous, and an (almost) spot on adaptation of the beloved classic, the first chapter in this highly anticipated trilogy doesn't disappoint in the slightest. While it does stumble slightly in the beginning, the experience as a whole is one of the most enjoyable films of the year. And while it does take some getting used to, the 48 FPS presentation (in 3D IMAX) is absolutely the best format to experience this journey. <br/><br/>4.5/5<br/><br/>It's been nearly a decade since we last entered Middle Earth as envisioned by Peter Jackson. There's no denying that The Return of the King was going to be a hard act to follow. So lets just get this straight right off the bat: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no where near the caliber of the final chapter we saw in 2003. What The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turns out to be is an unexpected, but necessary and welcome, change to Peter Jackson's landscape of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey features a memorable cast, but the standout is no doubt Martin Freeman as Bilbo. He completely nails Bilbo's character! Armitage is also fantastic as Thorin, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf is back again and still great. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but only a handful of the dwarfs get significant screen time. <br/><br/>The technical wizardry is also of note, no doubt. It's not truly noticeable until the latter part of the movie, where the special effects are absolutely incredible. The rest of the movie is absolutely stunning. The battle of Erebor, the escape from the goblin stronghold, the fights with orcs; everything is incredibly animated and beautifully done. In 48 FPS the action does take some getting used to (the higher frame rate removes the standard blur of special effects. In the higher frame rate one can see all the nuances of the special effects, making each animated character or item look ultra artificial or incredibly real), but a good 30-45 minutes into the movie and the presentation felt completely normal, and in fact made some of the later scenes look absolutely spectacular. I can't stress enough that, once your senses have adapted, the 48 FPS visuals are unlike anything else. <br/><br/>Howard Shore's original score is his bet yet for sure. Every bit of his original music captures the sweeping scale of the adventure, but it's the new theme that is still playing through my head even now. The first time you hear the haunting new theme it will stick to you, but by the time it is blasting over action scenes it will send chills down your spine. Original themes from TLOTR trilogy make brief returns in just the right places as well. Overall, It's Howard Shore's best work yet. <br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is more of a change of scenery from the past trips to Middle Earth. It's subject material is much lighter, the action is much more sparse, and the character building is considerably different. I will admit that the beginning is sluggish and overall a little too drawn out, the Goblin King looks like he was stripped out of a video game, and there are some inconsistencies here and there. So when it comes down to it, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not perfect. Far from it actually. It won't win any awards. It won't be favored among the critics. There are some silly choices made, and it isn't the most tightly crafted piece of film.<br/><br/>But I could care less.<br/><br/>This movie is adventurous, exciting, funny, all while capturing the original essence and character of the classic novel. The stunning special effects, great performances and incredible score make this a memorable return trip. But what truly stands out is Peter Jackson's eye for adventure. There just hasn't been a quality adventure movie in a long while. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the perfect antidote. It's big, epic filmmaking with a purpose: to tell a story (albeit the long winded way) that's grand in scale rooted deep within its characters. Make time to see this movie, and go into it with excitement, because The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great deal of fun and makes one thing inevitable above all else: the wait for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is going to be incredibly painful. <br/><br/>4.5/5 - while flawed, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is tremendously entertaining."

Rather than trying to top the previous three films in every way possible, Jackson tells an entirely different story. The plot does somewhat resemble the previous, but it's all taken from the book so you can't pick down on that! Much from the book has made it into the film, and you can easily work out what it was! We've already come to know and love most of the characters in this movie, so it's much easier to relate to the movie at once! The character development is still there, and I think we will get more in the extended edition! <br/><br/>In the technical area you will hear no gripes for me! First of all, the cinematography is awesome and beautiful as hell! The new HFR format is mostly to thank for that. The picture is so sharp and detailed that you'll probably need 5-10 minutes to get used to it, and I promise that you'll be blown away! Howard Shore's score is awesome and fits the movie very well! However, in the first three films all of the orcs and goblins were in fact real people. In this movie they are mostly just CGI, so it takes a little away from the sword fights. But the CGI and action is still quite good, and the props likewise! <br/><br/>But one of the best scenes we have in the movie is truly the return of Gollum! The whole riddle thing is fantastically written and expertly transformed into the film! I could watch a whole movie with these two characters talking riddles! Andy Serkis certainly haven't lost his touch on Gollum, and he delivers yet another striking, intriguing and brilliant performance as Gollum! Maybe even the best. We also have Ian McKellen back in action as Gandalf, which is awesome! He's a little older but it doesn't matter. Martin Freeman truly defines the role of Bilbo just with his first scene! I like Ian Holm, but I almost forgot him when Freeman appeared on-screen. Richard Armitage is likewise brilliant as Thorin, and delivers a great performance! Much have been made about the character of Radagast the Brown aka ""the new Jar Jar Binks."" Sylvester McCoy is a decent actor and the character wasn't that bad. He was very silly indeed, but he didn't receive much screen time... probably a good call. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of the first three movies go watch this! It's got some really beautiful props and the action is very good! You know and love the characters, and you are acquainted with Middle-Earth! The movie is entertaining and fun and you forget the running time! I couldn't have expected more from this movie! <br/><br/>8/10"

","The Hobbit exceeds every expectation that I had. Being a fan of both the novels and movies, I did set the bar high for this movie because... well, it's one of the most widely known franchises production history. I watched the movie in the real 3d and HFR(High Frame Rate) and most certainly was not left short. It did take a quick moment to adjust to the new 48 frames per second(standard DLP is 24), basically it's like switching from a 60hZ television to 240hZ. However, from then on, it was an epic adventure for the next 167 minutes and was glad to have chosen a showing that was using HFR.<br/><br/>Starts off by introducing back to our baseline characters, Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalph, etc. Some say this part is slow. I find it essential to get the audience back on the same page and draw us back into Middle Earth and The Shire. During this time you're also introduced to some brand new characters(mostly dwarfs) and they then set off on their adventure. Others also have said this movie is more directed towards kids rather than the adult audience. I disagree, there is humor to lighten the mood at the appropriate times, clever dialogue exchanges, and original thematic material. A whole new director means different movie layout, but you still obtain that LOTR experience that was so popular in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>CGI was fantastic(troll scene is amazing), major kudos to those in charge of the art design and scenery(amazing in 3d), and the battle scenes were mind blowing. I'm very glad they are breaking this out into a total of 3 movies because I would be disappointed to only have this movie experience once. Although you do get left with a cliff hanger, for me, it just build anticipation for the next few movies. The only negative I have is the fact the movie ended, could have sat there for another 3 hours watching this...<br/><br/>The Hobbit is by far the most enjoyable movie experience I have ever had."

","Just saw the movie yesterday in 3D and i think it was AMAZING, me and my brother set for the full 170 min and the only thing that i was sorry about was the 5 minute break that interrupted the flow of the movie. First of all let me say that i came as everybody did, with the expectation to see a great movie but an overstretched one that might spoil my fun. but to my and my brothers amazement it was a great movie, when the break came after half the movie was gone i thought that only 10 min have passed,the movie was so reverting and exciting i HAVE to say that i felt like there were no dead moments every thing was just like i hoped, and they even managed to spice it up with a lot of hummer and fun. All the actress do a Great job of acting and from the first moment you fill like you're being socked up into the plot, like being the 15 member of the gang. I must say that peter Jackson embellished some parts and added all kinds of scenes that aren't even in the book, but every thing looks welcomed and adds the appropriate tension and excitement to the plot. Most of all i must say the 3D effects look amazing, its even better then avatar. everything has a great depth to it and the computer graphics just overwhelms you at every corner of the movie. Its a must see movie. better then the lord of the rings and i know i'll go to see it again."
"MrKlette","8","7","16","13 December 2012"," Nearly as good as The Lord of the Rings
","The Hobbit I is a very good movie. All the characters are well played, the story and the attention to details are amazing, as are the effects, the costumes, the music - in short: the whole atmosphere; more often than not one is drawn irresistibly into the fantastic world of Middle Earth and into a group of dwarfs, a sorcerer and a hobbit, on their way to a long lost place called home. There are one or two scenes that make you wonder if it would not have been wiser to shorten them - but in the end, you sit there, stare at the end-credits and want more. It is a very good movie that raises the expectations for the next one to come, like The Lord of the Rings did, more than 10 years ago. There it is - the inevitable comparison to The Lord of the Rings. At some points during The Hobbit you just can't resist it: There is a camera-dive - but it is not awe-inspiring like the one down Isengart; there is a gigantic kingdom under the earth - but it is not as breathtaking as the halls of Moria; there are fabulous characters - but one is not captivated by them as one was with the fellowship of the ring; there are vile enemies and there is a lurking danger - but it won't freeze your blood like a dark rider. And after all, that feels exactly right. The Hobbit is not The Lord of the Rings. It was written earlier, written for children; it is a very good book, but not Tolkien's masterpiece. The movie kind of captures that. Aht that is an accomplishment in itself. And, by the way, like the book, the movie is funny."

Some people say ""Lord of the Rings should be watched before The Hobbit!"" I don't agree with them. The Hobbit comes before, I mean this all thing starts at The Hobbit. The Hobbit is before.

"danielloe","4","3","5","18 October 2015"," This movie manages to be both boring and ridiculous; good job!
","Normally when I write a review, I like to leave a little time where I just kind of introduce the movie, without actually giving you my opinion, but not this time, no I just want to dive right in and tell you what I thought. I didn't really expect to like this movie,and I was right. The movie drags... it drags something awful. It's 2.5 hours long, and it's the first half of a book that was like four hundred pages (maybe less, I'm not sure) nor was the plot particularly involved, and there were only like two characters who actually got an development, so this time is really unwarranted. I will admit that I've never been the biggest LOTR fan, they're fine movies, but they're really long, and there's not enough depth to the characters to really get me that interested. Like I say, they're fine movies, just not my favorites. This movie though, I don't even see the appeal. I'm going to make a comparison here that might ruffle a few feathers, but okay, whatever. The Hobbit movies are like The Star Wars prequels. That's how I see the Hobbit movies (though for the record, I don't hate the Star Wars prequels like everyone else seems to). They're dumb, long, overly boring, and they just shamelessly rip off the originals and in a sense, ruin their legacy. But what about this movie makes it so bad? Let me give you an example. Our protagonist, Bilbo, is just your average kinda hobbit guy who just likes to relax, who Gandalf wants to bring on this adventure for some reason. It takes him like forty-five minutes to go on this quest. Forty- five. Minutes. The movie also just stops at a point, and shows them in elf land just hanging out and...just sitting there. They just sit there for awhile, talk some about boring stuff and then the movie continues. Another point I've stressed heavily is how cartoonish this movie is. Like, they go to sleep in a cave, and it's a Goblin cave or something, so naturally the floor is a trapdoor, that they just pop open, and send our heroes plunging down a huge pit, seriously, like fifty feet at least, and no one's seriously injured. We also have an orc guy with mechanical arm for the villain who sticks around way too long. Let's also just hold a moment of silence where in a live action movie, being shown in theaters around the world, with a PG-13 rating, a man rides off on a sled...pulled by rabbits. Yeah, none of that is made up. Let's also mention all these characters we've got. Bilbo who's just... a guy, who wants to relax... Thorin a...dwarf who wants to get his kingdom back and who... doesn't like Bilbo, plus a dozen faceless, bumbling dwarfs... at least we got Gandalf."
"jonathanvorbes","8","3","5","16 January 2015"," Overall Solid
","I read these books as a kid, many times. I expected to have my heart broken a few times during the movie. And I did - there were a few additions that I found baffling, and a few things left out that I think should have been there. But overall the movie held together, and captured some of the magic that the book did once upon a time for me. <br/><br/>I do take umbrage with the fact that they turned it into 3 movies. I find this a bit silly. Maybe, maybe 2 movies, maybe. But they not only turned it into 3, but then added material to make it 3 really damn long movies? Bizarre move. And it would be one thing if they just added material from the Silmarillion, but they start making up characters and events... I don't know. Just let the source material do its job, executives. <br/><br/>Anyway, that aside, it's good. Obviously by the money it's making and the fan base, it will do fine, and hasn't disappointed anyone too terribly. Recommend."
"debbieandchris","5","3","5","31 July 2014"," I watched this movie in an hour and that's how long it should have been.
","Firstly, for this to be an 8 is the worst form of fanboyism as even if you're a rabid Peter Jackson/Tolkien fan you must surely be able to distinguish between the LOTR trilogy and the disjointed saga that this movie turned out to be. I'd also like to agree with the poster who stated that this was a film trying to cater for two distinct audiences (very young kids/not very discerning adults) as this really nails one of the major faults of the film. But anyway...<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough not to see this in a movie theatre and this allowed me to fast forward through all the unnecessary 'filler' (e.g. The mountain giants/ the awful goblin city/ the whole evil Orc arc etc.). I can only imagine that it's been split to make as much cash as possible but I don't really understand why Jackson would want to do this (it's not as though he needs the money).<br/><br/>Given that it was such a beloved book from my childhood and that I so really enjoyed the LOTR I really feel that they missed a trick here. <br/><br/>Horribly disappointed :-("
"gokulooki","5","3","5","6 March 2014"," The magic... it's gone.
","I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings film series. For me, it's probably one of if not the best film series i've seen. But the Hobbit for various reasons falls so short of this epic series that it might as well just die with the Balrog.<br/><br/>Why so harsh? Well it's because all of the magic that was in the Lord of the Rings is not there anymore. Peter Jackson and the rest of his crew have become somewhat lazy learning that apparently everything can now be CGI. The magic that came with the previous trilogy was that there was so much effort put into the 'bigiatures' of the sets and the action was mainly done in real life, the action was beautifully simple and only complicated when it needed to be, but now that there is the option of realistic CGI now, there is no need to put so much effort into this anymore. Due to this I feel like Jackson has tried to go 'bigger and better' but the reality is that it's more like he's saying 'let's make a large video game'. The sets are cgi, the people and characters are cgi, animals are cgi, there is no more physical creativity and effort that was in the original trilogy which makes this a flop. I mean even the main antagonist and his minions could have been done with makeup, but it takes less time and money to just animate it. Along with this there was less emphasis on the journey that the dwarfs are going through and more on the action or situations they are finding themselves in, this makes the epicness and distance of the journey seem less dangerous and massive and more like they are going around the corner. Massive beautiful landscapes is what was expected and this was not gratified much throughout the film.<br/><br/>It isn't all terrible though, I for one much liked the character Radagast, I thought he was portrayed rather terrifically and Sir Ian Mckellen as Gandalf is always on the right side of awesome. What was great about this film is that we saw Gandalf much more as a wizard, he did more than just turn his staff into a flashlight and throw fellow wizards around. Along with this I thought the scene with Gollum was fantastic, comical but continuously reminding us about how dangerous this character really is, a balance that many directors aren't able to do. Finally our young Mr. Bilbo Baggins played by Martin Freeman. If I were to pick a word to describe his performance it would be 'triumphant'. He plays the role of Bilbo to such perfection at times shivers go down my spine, his line delivery paired with his acting talent fits the character so well it's as if he were born to play it.<br/><br/>in summary this was not an all bad film, but I believe that Jackson and the rest of the crew have become lazy and much less passionate about the film, it is more of a job now rather than a hobby it seems. To answer gollum's question, no... the film is not ""juicy"" and it's not ""soft"" it's more like the taste of goblin, keeps you satisfied from being hungry but leaves a foul taste in your mouth"
"vanalstyne-dave","3","3","5","27 December 2013"," Visually stunning but not Tolkiens Hobbit
","I watched the Hobbit 2 on Christmas day. First I must say I attended the movie with significant trepidation as the Hobbit was a vast disappointment. This installment didn't fail my expectations.<br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning and the graphics without compare. The story as it's depicted moves quickly with sufficient action to maintain the audiences attention for the 134 minutes you sit in the theatre.<br/><br/>The problem is the story itself. It's about as butchered as is humanely possible. Sure it holds the basic story line.... noble quest, big dragon, lonely mountain, dwarfs, elves and men.... but a budding romance between wood elf and Kili? Seriously? This thread alone destroys any connection to the real world of Tolkiens' Hobbit. The whole scene of the dwarfs inside the mountain chasing Smaug was conspicuously missing from EVERY version of the Hobbit I have ever read, and believe me, I have read many. The Orcs invading Dale? Never happened. Elves following the Dwarfs after their escape? Kili getting wounded and left behind along with Fili? Nope. Using Athelas as a healing herb? Athelas isn't even mentioned until the Lord of the Rings and then its potency was limited to the hands of the rightful King of Gondor. What purpose to introduce it now?<br/><br/>Before I sound like a complete traditionalist, the whole segment of Gandalf entering Dol Guldur was a nice add however the movie again deviates from the story. Still..... not a total waste as traditionalists like myself probably enjoyed the diversion from the main storyline.<br/><br/>Aside from the significant and purposeless distractions from the original story line, Peter Jackson's multiple attempts at making ""cute"" scenes such as Bombur in a barrel rolling through Orcs detract rather than add to the story and make the dwarfs look like bumbling idiots instead of the proud, stalwart and taciturn beings they are in the original Tolkien works. <br/><br/>It's too bad Mr. Jackson felt the need to add and alter what is a cornerstone masterpiece of literature and a story enjoyed by millions of readers. Had he stuck to the original more closely I strongly suspect 2 films would have been sufficient but I expect the desire to pad the box office stats has lead to the multiple disappointing inclusions and bastardization of what many of us fondly remember. Has I never read the story, let alone read multiple times, I might have enjoyed the films but as it stands now I look to the final chapter with an expectations of complete frustration."
"richdesign","7","12","32","13 December 2012"," Good, but not great this time
","Sadly, this movie doesn't threaten to topple the greatness of LOTR. It is a good movie, for sure, but like for so many artists looking to follow up on a monumental achievement, it doesn't reach the same heights. It feels like they made the wrong movie for the book by trying to make The Hobbit fit into the LOTR mould. They are very different stories.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a much lighter (and shorter) tale written well before LOTR, and to me seems as if it was written for a slightly younger audience. So in trying to force the story to become an epic like LOTR it has more weight than the story can hold. The movie could have been a jolly good, ""There and Back Again"" adventure like the book is, but they became too bogged down in the details and moved too slowly through it. Some of the lighter more whimsical elements of the story try to come through, but they sit uneasily with the gravitas that has been imported into the rest of the story.<br/><br/>It feels very much as if they were still attached to LOTR and reluctant to let it go. In Rivendell, they add Galadriel and Saruman to the story for a long-winded council about an evil rising. I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett - and here, again, she is stunning as Galadriel - but why the need to insert LOTR characters when they don't add to the story? Apparently Legolas is also making a cameo. It really does feel like they had such a good time making the first trilogy that they were looking for an excuse to work with their old friends again. Had they wanted to explore some of the back story and appendices further, then the end of The Hobbit could perhaps have segued into that nicely.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment though would have to be with the visuals. I knew the story might be stretched a bit far, but I expected that this would be another visual masterpiece after all the talk of the fantastic technology used. There are few better in the world at creating beautifully detailed and realistic sets than Peter Jackson and Weta Workshops, yet from the opening scene it looked very much like a movie set - more like watching a film of a play. I did see this in 48 frames per second, which apparently is much clearer than the regular 24 fps, but even on my computer, comparing the trailers, it doesn't look as convincing as LOTR.<br/><br/>The Hobbit had big shoes to fill in terms of reputation, yet made the mistake of trying to fill those same shoes, rather than becoming its own story. If you liked LOTR, then you'll enjoy the movie, but just don't expect it to be as flawless as LOTR - it lacks the visual beauty and the fantastic story. It still gets a 7 out of 10 for me, probably due to a little home-country bias."

"adrongardner","6","11","29","16 December 2012"," Greedy as a dwarf and Pete's Dragon: Or How Bilbo Disappeared Without a Ring
","Making a film from a book comes down not to ""intent,"" but spirit. We can debate an author's ""intent"" for ages, but spirit is something more universally agreed upon. While the Lord of the Rings was a massive literary undertaking, the Hobbit was a small story about a small guy out to get some gold and slay a dragon. While the Lord of the Rings movies made notable changes, they kept the sprawling and epic spirit of the original books. With the Hobbit, in the battle to live up to, upstage and match Lord of the Rings, it has lost the small and relatively simple underpinnings of why it is so enduring and accessible.<br/><br/>First off, while technically it is an accomplished work, it's no masterpiece of storytelling. We don't know, learn or watch anything insightful about who Bilbo Baggins is. The movie largely depends on the prejudices we have from the Lord of the Rings movies. But even after reading all the books and seeing all the other movies, I kept wondering, who is this Bilbo guy? A lot of people may already know the books, myself included, but despite Martin Freeman's competent take on the character, he was largely invisible in the story, even without the ring.<br/><br/>Unless it has to do with the larger mythology at work from a number of other works by J.R.R Tolkien, there's just about three chapters worth of story from the actual Hobbit book here. I'm not on a quest of how ""faithful"" Peter Jackson was or wasn't to the original book, per say. Tolkien went back and tinkered George Lucas style innumerably with the Hobbit after Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit people read today differs in some key areas from the one readers first took up in 1937.<br/><br/>What I am saying is, frankly, there really isn't a whole lot going on for three hours. Shire, quest, bad guys, running, elves, Gollum, running, bad guys. Mountain.<br/><br/>That's the entire movie. It could very well be the other three LOTR movies in summary also. The action is well done, but mostly unmotivated. When things bog, I can almost hear Peter Jackson pressing the Goblin button. ""Ah the audience must be shifting after 15 minutes of exposition by these old guys, time to throw in some battle scenes."" I think if you simply accept this is just the first in a serialized story, and you're OK with the idea that this is just a prelude piece of mixed quality, then the Hobbit is worth the money. But as a standalone film, it fails in as much as we've already seen this movie done by the same people a few years ago.<br/><br/>If you saw Fellowship of the Ring, you have already seen this movie. It almost feels like a remake. The helicopter shots could have been recycled as well as the filming locations and set piece placements. I know it's the same universe but man, there's a real lifelessness to the whole thing. The actors are all excellent, but it's the writing and production that seem awfully stale. There's a feeling, much like George Lucas in the prequels, Peter Jackson is a little more fascinated with his toys in this than the story. <br/><br/>I'm sure there was a lot of things in this movie for many people to enjoy, but I just couldn't shake the feeling this, like that last Harry Potter movie, is a pure money grab. <br/><br/>Throwing in the mythological expansions, I can accept maybe two movies from this core story. Three? No. That's just pure dwarfish greed. Or perhaps Pete's inner Dragon.<br/><br/>ABOUT HFR 48 FPS:<br/><br/>I'm amazed it ever got all that much press. This is nothing new. They've been over cranking movie shutters for more than 100 years. In some scenes the effect is similar to a Charlie Chaplain movie. In others, it is indeed reminiscent of an old BBC Dr. Who episode. The higher frame rate however does give a FAR better 3D presentation. The 24 FPS 3D is pretty much a waste of money and is a dark murky affair with the glasses on. The real problem is the 3D effect is so pronounced and clear, the actors are even more separated from the background and other computer characters which basically looks like people talking in front of a green screen. The camera moves are a little jerky with the higher frame rate and future uses of HFR would be advised to use softer lighting pallets, and smoother, slower whip pans as there is no longer the blur frames to smooth out the movement visually. Other than that, I think it's largely a manufactured controversy to sap more money from your wallet. HFR is the best way to see the movie, there are indeed problems, but it's not that big a deal."

"grumpy-3","6","21","65","9 December 2012"," too long by far
","Dear Peter Jackson, after giving us perfect films in the Rings trilogy, you now have to go and spoil things. the warnings started with King Kong a very good film but a half hour too long. You then take what should have been a smallish film and you blow The Lovely Bones up and inflate it to a level that brings on tedium. And now you take a small book and slight story and again inflate it to a ridiculously long running time. What should have been one punchy maybe three hour film you decided to make into three, and by judging the first one, overlong and unnecessarily long films. The other big contention with The Hobbit is your high frame rate, most of the film especially the interiors look like TV used to look in Britain, many decades ago, TV drama used to use film for all exterior scenes and Video for interiors and you would notice the big change in the look the film sequences giving an added lustre and look with the interiors dull and flat, well that's how many shots look like in the hobbit dull and flat, there is no magic no FILM look. The 3d was basically non existent. Considering this is made 12 years after Fellowship, and should have looked way better, its pretty dismal going. Also by making the Orcs cgi quite a bit has been lost here,the fights had no real impact. its a great shame that someone who started out making small but perfect films with short running times has now become so bloated."
"grayhares","3","12","33","3 January 2013"," An abject disaster. An unmitigated mess of a movie.
","It's hard to know where to begin when reviewing this 3 hour Peter Jackson disaster. You could start with the High Frame Rate production, which gives everything an unreal/hyper-real quality which is distracting to the point of farce.<br/><br/>Or you could go with the fact that they are not actually telling the story of The Hobbit. They are telling the story of the compendium of Middle Earth, which is 12 books long and only 17 nerds have read in their mothers' basements.<br/><br/>But I think I'll focus on the first moment when I knew the movie had gone off the rails. The meal that constitutes the first meeting between Bilbo and the dwarfs. In the book it is a whimsical way of introducing Bilbo and the dwarfs and highlighting their differences. It is about 12 pages and then they move on.<br/><br/>In the movie it takes something like 45 minutes to get thru the whole meal. The two songs from the scene are a few paragraphs in the book but take like 10 minutes in the movie (Yes, they sang both songs). Add in the prologue about Smaug and the Dwarf King, and the movie is already 1 hour old before the company leaves the Shire. It's basically the whole movie in a nutshell. A long slogging, meandering attempt at an epic that just ends up being a swamp of CGI and overacting.<br/><br/>This movie highlights what it takes to make a book into a good movie. You have to know which parts to keep, which parts to eliminate, and which parts to combine in order to tell the story properly. Jackson does none of this. He takes the cowards way out and keeps everything, and tosses in some bits that aren't even in the book. The result is horrendous.<br/><br/>There are a few bright spots. Martin Freeman does as well as anyone could with the mess he was handed. The riddle showdown with Gollum was compelling and well done. It was the only instance where Jackson made good choices. Deciding which riddles to keep, which to get rid of and shooting the scene in a lively expeditious manner.<br/><br/>But that scene occurs 2 AND A HALF HOURS into the movie. Not worth it, I'm afraid."

","It's a Friday night and i am twiddling my fingers what i should do for the evening, my friends call me up and say you want to make a journey to the cinema, it was unexpected as they normally want to go the local bar for a drink or two. They said let's go and watch The Hobbit, why not<br/><br/>There has been a lot of hype towards this movie and me being me, i am very sceptical about movies with over the top CGI. We arrived at the cinema in time, my friend ordered Sweet Popcorn which i don't like so i thought i would walk in the cinema empty handed. <br/><br/>The movie began and the CGI captivated me for about half hour but then i started to move around in my chair and feeling bored, bored to the point that i got off out of my chair and walked out the cinema trying to kill time in the ticket area. I pulled out my Iphone and went to my trusty IMDb app to check the duration of the movie, 169 minutes. The pain that i had to go back into the cinema and watch a very poor choice of a movie. Before i went in i purchased some popcorn so i can concentrate more on eating my refreshment then look a the screen.<br/><br/>There was no realism, for example a goblin vs a hobbit, who should win that round? The hobbit and dwarfs walking through the cliff tops - the mountains start to fight against each other and debris falls to the ground, but to my amazement the hobbit nor dwarf fell down the cliff, damn<br/><br/>The popcorn was running out the movie had an hour to go, i looked at my friends showed my hand to them, shook their hands and said i am off home. To sit in the cinema for another hour would have killed me, in fact i felt like standing in front of the screen and shouting out 'What a load of *&^t', i held back walked out through the exit with a smile on my face <br/><br/>I know its a fantasy movie but come on you can't review The Hobbit as 10 out 10 <br/><br/>I give my salted popcorn 10 out of 10 for putting a smile on my face and entertaining me with its salty taste."

"jadepietro","6","9","23","18 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexciting Journey
","This film is mildly recommended. <br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey suffers from a terrible case of the ""cutes"". So, to honor Peter Jackson's misguided approach to J.R.R. Tolkien's classic tale, this review will segue into the world of the pun and groaners due to the candy-coated handling of this slightly disappointing venture. <br/><br/>In this prequel of immensely superior The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Martin Freeman stars as Bilbo Baggins, uncle of Frodo ( or Dildo Gaggings, if he ever needs a porn name ). Ian McKellan returns as the wizard, Gandalf, with a mission impossible for the young hero of our story to accept. Riches and treasures may be the reward although they are guarded by an evil dragon named Smaug ( and there just might be a magical ring too ). So Bilbo teams up with a baker's dozen of dwarfs ( as if seven or eight wasn't enough ). They set off to do battle and reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor, fighting orcs, giants, and other creatures along the way.<br/><br/>Though not named for the most famous grouping of tiny people, excluding those ever lovin' Munchkins, these pint-size adventurers exhibit the same traits found in the land of Disney. It's a small world after all and an even smaller wonder that there is not a Sneezy or Happy found in the bunch, but Dopey and Grumpy could surely fit in this motley bunch. This merry band of men all lose their respective charm mid-entrance as silly slapstick ensues. Endearing they're not. Annoying they are. <br/><br/>It's Middle-earth here, and middling is best way to describe the treatment of this film adaptation, especially in the film's slow first hour or so. The film takes an unexpected extended approach, making Tolkien's single novel into three separate installments for moviegoers to view in the upcoming years. Obviously Jackson and the studio honchos are hoping the Hobbit franchise will be Hobbit-forming. ( Well, I for one am not addicted to this series as yet. )<br/><br/>This Hobbit hobbles along its merry way, happy to be gonzo in its extravagance with the latest state-of-the-art CGI and dopey in its breakthrough with fast-speed technology. Jackson wanted a sharper image to his film and produced it with a higher frame rate, ( 48 FPS vs. the customary 24 FPS ) which has gotten mixed results from those who have seen that version in a few selected theaters. I am not one of the lucky ( or unlucky ) moviegoer to experience that sensation as that version is only slated to play in specially equipped movie- houses, none of which are nearby. ) Still, if only Jackson paid more attention to script details, story-wise, the film could have pick up its own pace too. The overall tone of the film version resembles a live action cartoon rather than a thrilling fantasy adventure tale for grown-ups.<br/><br/>However, there is much to recommended with the film's splendid production values and the technically proficient CGI that one comes to expect from the director and his talented film crew. Some encounters resonate well, like the set pieces in the goblins' lair and the sudden attack of the stone giants. The battle scenes are uniformly well staged and the fluid tracking shots help create some tension, mostly in the film's latter sequences. <br/><br/>There is also a brilliant sequence toward the end of the film which brings Bilbo and his nemesis, the delightfully tormented and conflicted Gollum ( winning animated by Andy Serkis and the artisans ) into play. The give-and-take of these characters and their clever dialog of riddles energizes the film, bringing it momentarily to life. It is only that brief resuscitation that shows exactly what this film could have been if the filmmakers had the courage to embrace a more serious view of the story instead of its childlike safe and innocuous vision of the tale. The overly sensitive handling of the darker side of evil may bring more kiddies to the till, but at what price glory?<br/><br/>There's just too much sunshine and lollipops in this film's version for this moviegoer. I sat there a-waiting the sparkling rainbows and pretty unicorns to come dancing into view. This film experience delivered an unexpected point of view from Jackson and company, one that I did not envisioned from Tolkien's book. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey should have been drastically cut down to size, rewritten, and renamed The Hobbit: An Unending Journey. Pompous it is. Precious it ain't.

"feanor-walsh","5","9","23","18 December 2012"," Disgusting
","This review is going to sound harsh, so before i begin, I am an avid fan of fantasy literature, especially High fantasy, and The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are of course central to that genre. So i take them very seriously. This movie has made it very clear that Jackson failed utterly to grasp the hobbit. I expected certain additions, like events involving the white council and the like, but other things were not only absurd, they were inexcusable. Radagast's appearance in the movie an addition to begin with, his depiction bordered on the offensive. While not quite from the same cloth as Gandalf or Sauruman, the appearance he does make in the Fellowship of the Ring book suggests that he was of a fairly serious demeanor and has little patience people, but is not silly or befuddled in any way. The suggestion in the intro in the movie, that Thranduil payed any sort of homage to Thror, is beyond absurd. As is the idea that Thror had developed any sort of madness. No Elflord, even a lord of the Moriquendi like Thranduil would ever give anything like fealty or homage to a dwarf. To a particular fan of the books like myself, the suggestion is offensive. Next, Azog the Goblin (Goblins and orcs are by and large the same race, but goblins have lived beneath the mountains longer and tend to be more hunched over) was killed by Thorin at the battle of Moria, and it was a certainty. His addition was among the most unacceptable changes in the movie. Jackson shows clear disregard for who should be alive and who should be dead. Now, Bilbo and the dwarfs. That fact that some of the dwarfs did not have beards, or had short beards, is stupid. One of the distinguishing features of dwarfs in Tolkien's mythos are their long beards, regardless of age. Another distinguishing feature of dwarfs is their stubbornness and pride. About half of the dwarfs in the movie are depicted acceptably, the others are silly or bizarre. In regards to Bilbo himself, I feel that Martin freeman simply did not feel like Bilbo should have. It should be remembered that Bilbo was in his 50's when the Hobbit starts, something and Jackson, and Martin, fail to display in his demeanor. Frankly, anyone who truly loves the books, should not like this movie."

","I Have red the hobbit , I've red Lord Of The Rings, thus i was exited to see them coming alive on the big screen. Lord of the Rings was superb, no question about it. Now ""The Hobbit"" came along and failed on an epic scale.<br/><br/>Everything changed from the real feel approach of Lord of the Rings to a Comical Candy-land 3D CG ride approach. I know, The hobbit was a children's book, but i don't think the movie version should emphasize this as much as it did.<br/><br/>The movies color palette was so saturated that it completely destroyed my chance of getting into the story. The Dwarven-fellowship resembled more the 7 Dwarfs of Snowithe, then actually ""Gimly"".<br/><br/>Maybe The Special Edition Blu-ray will be a compilation of all 3 ""Hobbit"" movies compressed into a single 4hour movie, and maybe that will manage to capture me. <br/><br/>The Movie deserved about 4 out of 10 stars but being it hyped up in the first 20 reviews or so i decided that i only give it 1 star."
"djcyro","10","8","20","27 December 2012"," BEST movie I've seen in a long time
","You know what gets my goat? People who complain that a movie doesn't match the book. First of all, you realize that when reading a book, your IMAGINATION is the theatre screen. NOTHING can match YOUR imagination. Books are written that way for you to enjoy, and no matter how good the director is, a movie will never totally match what you imagined when reading the book. So, if you read the book and expect the movie to be the same and you imagined it, you will always be disappointed. Unless, of coarse, you have virtually no imagination, then a movie may help you.<br/><br/>That being said, I believe that Peter Jackson's version of the Hobbit stories is FANTASTIC. This movie goes into great depth and detail that many movies feel they do not need to. This movie is head and shoulders above most other movies. Its like how Disney World is way better than Six Flags parks.<br/><br/>I thought the 3D was great. OK, some of the animations on the edges of the screen were choppy, but that may have been by design. After you get adjusted to watching 3D, you get immersed in the movie.<br/><br/>I loved the character development, and the detail. The musical score was great. I let myself be pulled into the movie, and enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>Many of the critics putting down this movie probably don't enjoy anything anyway and will complain about everything.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor during the holidays, and take some time to see this movie. Let yourself go, and let your imagination open up, and you will really love this movie."

","I want to start by saying that it is a good movie. It's funny, full of adventure. But if you are, like I am, a fan of Tolkien, and that you expect to see The hobbit, you might be as disappointed as I am. I don't really know if it's due to a need to appeal to the most people, or if it's due to a need of making 3 movies instead of 1 or 2 (because let's be honest, it would have been enough for the book. It's not that long compare to the lotr books, which was made into 1 movie each), but they complete write entirely scenes that never happens in the book, or any other books of Tolkien to my knowledge. They created a bad guy. They created ""connexion"" to the lotr story that didn't need to be made. And they screwed up some really important scene. To sum up, It's a good movie, but it's not the hobbit."

","2 hours and 40 minutes flew by, while I sat in awe of the magnificent spectacle in front of me. Peter Jackson and the entire crew has done it again with The Hobbit. I was skeptical to see the movie at first due to the negative reviews and my want to not be disappointed by the same man that brought the wonders of Middle Earth to life in Lord of the Rings trilogy; but I couldn't resist my overwhelming urge to satisfy my craving for more of that magic that Jackson provided previously, and I for one can say I will never doubt the man again. If you have a sense of adventure and an attention span longer than the short-term memory of a goldfish then you will not regret seeing this movie."
"kenchiang06","10","8","20","18 December 2012"," An Excellent movie for another epic trilogy
","I have watched the movie at 48 fps with 3D and it was simply AWESOME. I will say the first 5 minutes may make you feel uncomfortable but after that it was great. It is a REAL 3D movie with lots of actions and special effects which suits the environment of the middle earth. Trees, eagles, rocks and water, PJ has just made them better than the first trilogy.<br/><br/>For the fighting scenes, it is the best part of this movie. It is an excitement after a setting-telling half. I love the scene of the wargs, it made me remember the Rohan horsemen who ambushed the orcs. The effects are great, the falling stones was fascinating. I will not complain about small scale battling since there is really no major war in this part of trilogy.<br/><br/>For the story, I don't really understand why people keep hating on this. I think that the scene in the Shire is good. It makes a great description on the behavior of the Dwarfs, the both dining scenes of dwarfs have explained the difference between both races. The movie has shown the mistrust very well. I think that is good!<br/><br/>Yes I think there are some little overuse of the CG because I think some actions in the movie looked odd,( like the plating throwing scene). But The overall flow is still very clear and it gives the audience who have not read the book a very good explanation of what is going on with the story ! The most important part is that PJ followed most parts of the book without adding some freaking elves in keep.<br/><br/>This is a different movie, audience cannot directly compare it with the LOTR trilogy. It is more detailed and more suitable for those who are ready to go for an adventure in the middle-earth. I am looking forward for the other parts of the trilogy! This movie deserves a 10/10 rating."
"justas-bajoriunas","10","8","20","18 December 2012"," A masterpiece!
","We've waited so long for this movie to come and my expectations we're completely fulfilled, when I saw this movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, to those who don't like the pacing, the more adventurous and less epic than LOTR feel, you don't understand the concept of the storyline. It was written by J.R.R.Tolkien as a children's' book. That's why the movie has jumps from funny to grim moments (as it was in the book). That's why the camera sometimes is like from a video game. The book is written light- heartedly, and so is the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, to those, who complain about the soundtrack. While it has some of the same tracks from LOTR, also they gave new melodies to this movie. The ""Song of the Lonely Mountain"" was breathtaking and so was the new dwarfish theme. The fight scenes also had intense background music.<br/><br/>Also the appearance of characters that we're only mentioned in the book is quite understandable. It's because Mr. Jackson didn't want to have holes in the storyline. That is why he included Radagast the Brown, The Necromacer (Witcher of Angmar), Galadriel, Frodo and old Bilbo in the beginning - to make the movie more definite, to make it more complete.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is very different from The Lord of the Rings, because the book which the Hobbit is based on wasn't dedicated to grown- ups. Tolkien wrote it to his children. That's why you have to watch the movie when you're in a good mood, not being grumpy and something from this movie that doesn't have to be there."
"krish-vellanki","10","8","20","14 December 2012"," WOW! Better than the book... loved it.
","The Hobbit, as a book, and as a story is a little weaker when compared to those of LOTR. But this movie for a change, outshines the book.... everything about this movie is awesome. The pace is perfect and gives us fan boys of the series, enough time to soak in LOTR nostalgia. The references are so very well placed too. For once, the critics who reviewed negatively do not matter. The scenes between Bilbo and Gollum are alone enough reason to give it a 10 rating. Add to that the ever wonderful background score, the amazing cinematography with stunning visuals, and some superlative performances by all the actors, this movie satiates everyone's thirst for middle earth adventure.<br/><br/>Watch it in anyway you wish to, it will still manage to surpass your expectations."

","Few non-elven words can describe how pleasantly surprised I was by this film. At first, I was seeing the movie simply because I wanted to experience the new 48 fps and what better way to do that than taking a trip back to Middle-Earth. However, once the film started, I was immediately mentally and emotionally immersed in the very simplistic yet intriguing tale of Bilbo Baggins. <br/><br/>Being a major Tolkien fan and a self titled Middle-Earth historian, I had very high expectations for the film. From the few clips I had scene, I was a little worried that Peter Jackson was going to pull a ""James Cameron"" and forget that the effects should compliment the story, not drive it. The Hobbit is a simple story and I didn't want this factor to push Jackson to add pointless scenes and characters simply to make his trilogy a possibility. However, this was not the case. I was throughly pleased to see another brilliant work of art come from the mind of Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>The Hobbit is no epic like Fellowship, Two Towers, or Return of the King, but it does stay true to the emotional and humanness that we find within our beloved hobbits. The Hobbit holds countless comical, emotional, and action packed moments that leave the viewer like a Hobbit at a feast, begging for more."
"limonali","10","8","20","14 December 2012"," Amazing, has blown me away.
","This review is going to be very short, because I am still completely blown away. It rendered me speechless. I saw the Hobbit last night and I can't stop being in the movie, in my head. Sinking back into Middle Earth is executed perfectly, it's as if we have never left. For me that's one of the biggest strengths of this movie. <br/><br/>I heard complaints that it is a less epic story than LOTR, and in fact: it is, as it well should be. It is more of a 'fantasy meet a road movie' than LOTR has been. But for me it doesn't take away anything from the amazing, most beautifully crafted spaces of Middle Earth and the characters played SUPERBLY by Freeman or Armitage. I loved seeing the old characters coming back, for some reason I really liked seeing Elrond, he is fully fleshed out this time around. In short, this was amazing. <br/><br/>Add the score that is hauntingly familiar yet completely new, with a dark, murky, cave-like undertones of dwarfs, and you have perfection. I think shots and music are a work of genus. I will be coming back to the cinema for sure."
"hela898","10","8","20","12 December 2012"," An Unexpected Journey...
","Just came from the 3d Imax ( 24 fps) screening and had to write... Firstly, I would like to point I'm a big fan of Jackson's adaptation to LOTR. Secondly, like most of the fans I REALLY anticipated and longed for this movie to come out, and as the first reviews came, my expectations gradually decreased and I came to watch the Hobbit with no expectations at all.<br/><br/>If I must describe The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I would portrait it as a roller-coaster ride. Like all epic rides the movie starts quite slowly and as it progresses, you feel that any moment now, the ride will hit its peak and the movie will explode, and when it does, this ride just keeps getting faster and better. The Hobbit has all the ingredients a good LOTR franchise should have- Amazing music, epic fights, humorous moments and also some kitschy moments. I won't share any spoilers as I don't want to ruin your experience, but I tell you this my friends- If you enjoyed LOTR, slayed Orcs in your daydreams, and always wanted to visit Rivendell, you will surely enjoy this awesome fantasy ride."
"harryplinkett14","1","15","44","20 December 2012"," Why didn't the eagles take the dwarfs to Lonely Mountain?
","Yes, this film is so repetitive, it even repeats the same plot holes from LOTR. We have seen it all before: the vargs, the elves, the battles, the goblin infested caves, those countless closeups of Gandalf's face as he stares with a mixture of concern, joy, and philosophical insight. I'd like to ask McKellan what he thinks of when Peter Jackson asks him: Hey, mate, can you do the 'face' again for the closeup?<br/><br/>Another problem with The Hobbit is the style. The book was written before LOTR and it had an entirely different tone. It was a book written for children that had singing goblins and talking dragons. However, the film does not fully acknowledge this fact, trying desperately to maintain stylistic continuity with the LOTR films. Thus it has both flying rabbits and dwarfs that spontaneously invent a song about Bilbo on the one hand, and savage slaughter involving decapitation, limb removal, and a monster from the movie '300' on the other. This constant shift of tone leaves the audience confused and unable to connect, never knowing whether the scene will end with someone getting a pie thrown in their face or having a limb chopped off. <br/><br/>But the main problem with the film is storytelling and character development. The storytelling is confused. Scene transitions are often clumsy and it appears that the characters end up in the same situation time and again. If someone asked me to retell the plot I could not do it. I remember similar chase scenes, I remember them running away, and I remember they ended up in some cave several times, but that is about it. I also remember a scene where vargs chase a sleigh pulled by rabbits while the rest of them play hide-and-seek with the orcs. That could be the most confusing scene in film history. I don't know whether to blame it on poor direction or poor editing. <br/><br/>But to get to the characters: they are simply not well developed. Obviously when one has thirteen of them it is very hard to bring them all to life and make us care for them, but when you decide to make THREE films in a row about a story that could have been told in one, you better spend time making the audience learn about the characters and empathize with them. I would have preferred more scenes about the dwarfs and fewer scenes involving wizards exchanging pointless lines in Rivendell. The bottom line is that I never once felt concerned about the fate of any of these characters, including Bilbo. They resembled characters in a video game, and as we see them fighting goblins in their cave at the end, the whole thing becomes literally indistinguishable from a game. Jackson forgets that the one thing films CAN and MUST do is create strong characters and make us empathize with them. Big action scenes can now be created by a computer, and they do not impress. It always comes down to characters and frankly someone should have pointed this out to Jackson even as he was making LOTR because it suffered from the same problem. Case in point: Martin Freeman as Bilbo. He is a good actor and he is great at playing the insecure, awkward type. Yet he is given too little to work with, and frankly when he is given center stage he is not given any good lines.<br/><br/>As for the use of 3D and and double frame rate, it ends up demolishing anything that was left of the film. The 3D looks cheap and childish, ruining the persuasiveness of the image rather than increasing it; and the 48 fps rate creates an image that is more similar to video than film, making the Hobbit seem like fan fiction. This amateurish feel is strengthened by confusing storytelling. At times the film comes across as a TV series, with a focus on individual scenes and not enough concern for the whole.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I actually enjoyed the bits with the wizard on a sleigh the most in this entire film, and that should not have been the case. Sack the screenwriter, the director, and the editor before you make a sequel.<br/><br/>And never ever use 48fps again."

The special effects were hit and miss, and there were so many unnecessary stuff in the movie that shouldn't have been there. Terrible movie, just terrible. I hate most of the acting. It all sounded pretentious and so important. The action scenes dragged on, the talking scenes dragged on, and the beginning especially dragged on. The music wasn't particularly great, but I did like the misty mountain song. I couldn't even distinguish the dwarfs from each other sometimes. Most of them had zero personality, and were boring.

"c_tisseyre-107-838331","7","11","30","12 December 2012"," An Epic and Enchanting Film Affected By An Inconsistent Tone and Fragmented Story
","The Lord of the Rings made me fall in love with movies. A towering achievement of craftsmanship and epic yet intimate storytelling, Peter Jackson's film trilogy was a visionary piece of filmmaking that had me dreaming for over a decade. <br/><br/>I never like to compare a film with its source material. Both art forms are significantly different and should be judged on their respective merits. As long as a movie adaptation doesn't betray the spirit of its origins but rather builds upon them, I'll be on board. <br/><br/>In that light, The Lord of the Rings was a triumphant example of an ambitious director transposing Tolkien's literary narrative to a powerful and moving film experience. It should also be said that each Rings chapter constituted a great, fully realised film in its own right. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey should then also be reviewed through that same critical lens. <br/><br/>As a film then, An Unexpected Journey fails to meet the impossibly high expectations that were set with The Lord of the Rings, but it still remains an enjoyable and enchanting motion picture. It's a solid, well- crafted film that contains many of the elements that made the previous trilogy memorable. The fragmented narrative, inconsistent tone and excessive special effects, however, prevent An Unexpected Journey from being a great movie. <br/><br/>The film is perhaps too faithful to the details of Tolkien's novel, as it includes anecdotal scenes that are probably best left for the extended edition. And whereas Fellowship of the Ring can really stand on its own, this first chapter of The Hobbit trilogy truly feels like an introductory chapter of a greater whole. Jackson is establishing many character arcs here – maybe too many – to justify an entire trilogy of films based on one novel. The result is a fragmented film searching for a focal point.<br/><br/>Fortunately, that focus finally settles on Bilbo Baggins, played to perfection by Martin Freeman. Freeman is Bilbo here. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role. His character arc of starting up as a homely comfort-loving Hobbit becoming a brave adventurer is well developed. It's also wonderful to see Ian McKellen as Gandalf again, who is given more screen time this time around. McKellen is better than ever, giving the film a fine touch of humour and a much needed sense of gravitas. Speaking of which, Richard Armitage is great as Thorin Oakenshield, who is clearly presented as the Aragorn of this series to good effect. He anchors the dwarfs' quest in a heroic and convincing manner. A couple of other dwarfs get their time to shine, but that's it. And while Jackson admirably tries to introduce each and every one of them, we don't really have the time to invest ourselves in the rest of the company. <br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair to measure up the first instalment of The Hobbit to the memory we treasure of The Lord of the Rings. Yet, Peter Jackson consciously invites the comparison by structuring the film in a way that echoes The Fellowship of the Ring. He also neatly ties the two stories together with a narrative framing device and by bringing back characters from his first visit to Middle Earth. <br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey suffers from an occasionally confused tone. I got the uneasy feeling at times that Jackson bet on fans' nostalgia for the previous trilogy to compensate for some flaws of the film. The movie flirts with greatness in moments when it achieves the majestic sweep of the Rings films. In other instances, however, Jackson struggles to find the appropriate tone for this new venture. Humorous moments are most welcome when they reflect the spirit of the novel, particularly during the terrific introductory dinner scene at Bilbo's house, but at other times they feel out of place. Radagast's antics, for example, feel like they don't belong in this specific vision. By tying together the majestic tone of his Rings trilogy and the more carefree and joyful spirit of The Hobbit, Jackson attempts an ambitious balancing act that doesn't always work.<br/><br/>Since this is the first chapter of a three-movie adaptation of a single novel, there's not much drama that can unfold in an emotionally satisfying manner. I never felt as invested in the proceedings as much as I wished, and the action scenes are not as thrilling as I hoped they would be. The intermittent overkill of special effects in some scenes drew me out of this incredibly immersive world. While The Lord of the Rings made equally great use of practical effects and CGI, this new film relies much too heavily on the latter. The magic is occasionally lost, particularly in a scene in a mine and with Thorin's nemesis, Azog, a fierce Orc who has absolutely no reason to be CGI and yet still is. Thank heavens for Gollum, played with exceptional skill once again by the terrific Andy Serkis, who demonstrates why Weta can produce some truly extraordinary work. It's thrilling to see Gollum again, this time around in a standout scene where Martin Freeman really comes into his own as Bilbo.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings, rest assured that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic adventure, propelled once more by a beautiful score by Howard Shore, lush cinematography by Andrew Lesnie and the same expert craftsmanship orchestrated by Peter Jackson. I suspect die-hard Tolkien fans will be very pleased; others might think the film is too anecdotal at times due to its faithfulness to the novel. It's a solid and impressive start, if not an exceptional one, that foreshadows great things to come. The final moments in the film reveal that the throat-clearing is out of the way and that Jackson has found a fitting tone. It will be very interesting to see how the next two chapters unfold. In any case, it's truly great to be back in Middle Earth."

I do not get all the negative reviews of this movie, I almost decided to forgo seeing it in the theater after hearing a bad review on radio. I can't imagine what motivates the reviewers. I expected to be asleep about halfway through the dwarf dinner scene, instead I felt like I was visiting with old friends. It was perfect. I believe I read the Hobbit 40 years ago more or less, and as I said I am no fanatic, but it felt comfortable seeing it on screen. And yes I know it is greedy for them to turn one book into three movies so they can generate more revenue, but hey...I don't care, I am just happy there are two more movies to see. It makes the experience last longer. I also wonder why reviewers critique this movie like it was a contemporary drama. It is a Fantasy based on a book for god's sake. So what if the movie does not follow the book exactly, which movie based on a book does? Go see this with an open mind and you will not be disappointed."

","First off, I must tell you all that I am a normal guy.. not some movie critic who knows all about directing or anything on the technical side but listen here.. Don't be fooled by the critics!<br/><br/>The Hobbit tonight was one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen in my life. I am a Tolken fan and a Peter Jackson ""Lord Of The Rings"" fan but I think like a lot of 'Star Wars' fans of the original trilogy, you can tell whether the prequel is good or back no matter how much you love the original or the world it has created.<br/><br/>I hear all these people going on about frame rate.. how it's been ""hollywooded"" up.. poor connection to the viewer and all these other reasons why the Hobbit was disappointing.. but I don't understand what these 'critics' were watching. <br/><br/>For a fan.. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was everything you wanted, needed and more.. The characters, locations, action, storyline, memorable scenes (The Riddles) and humour is everything the Hobbit needed to be. It is not 'Childish'.. it is purely more light hearted than Lord of the Rings because it is true to the original author!<br/><br/>For someone who has not entered the world of Middle-Earth.. There is no way that you will not enjoy the ride!<br/><br/>(By the way.. if you don't like 3D.. WATCH IT IN 2D!!)<br/><br/>I hope you guys have had or will have a similar experience to the one I had.. Going in with high expectations and being completely satisfied is something special. <br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a film where you can get sucked into its world easily. And when the credits start rolling, miss and crave to be back into the same world... A year is way too long for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.. Bring it on!"
"markbeiline","8","7","17","22 December 2012"," Satisfies the Tolkien fan, but could have been better.
","First off, I'd like to begin the review by saying that I've watched it in 24 fps without 3D, and I'm VERY happy I had decided so. I had read beforehand horrible, horrible things about 48 fps, and 3D just isn't my style. WARNING this review contains spoilers, but come on! : hasn't everyone read the book? I myself have read it 4 times with great pleasure.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie stays very close to the book, with the exception of subtle or sometimes not-so-subtle additions there and here. For the most part, they didn't work out well. There are 2 main reasons why, at least to me, these moments have failed. 1) I understand The Hobbit was written in a very different style than LOTR. Some even call it ""a children's book"". I agree that it has a few comic moments, but I have always pictured the book as an epic journey rather than a crazy romp that has the audience laughing. Sometimes, the jokes were witty and the original humour is well delivered. However, some humour stank of the nasty cheap crowd-pleaser. It's like Jackson forgot about the Oscars and headed for the money (if you catch my drift). The Goblin King and Radagast are a great example of this. The book was already funny, they didn't have to try and make it even funnier. 2) In the book, the dwarfs encounter many perilous situations and barely escape, but each escape is believable. The danger is still there. You can still feel like it's just perfect timing. In the movie, the dwarfs are just god-like. For instance, in the original, in the goblin tunnels, the company is barely running fast enough from death. In the adaptation, this becomes a real goblin-slaying fest. With the addition of the stone giants' scene, the company seems invincible. There is NO MORE DANGER! They survived so many falls and blows I could barely feel concerned when another ""danger"" surged forth.<br/><br/>Another moment I didn't appreciate is the visual style. It looks too perfect. From what I understand, the post-production unit sort of photo shopped the takes. You know a highlight there, a lighting adjustment here etc. In LOTR, the takes felt beautiful, but yet they didn't look fake. It was easier to immerse into this world, if after all, it looks like ours. The Hobbit looks like a dreamland. From the surreal colour palette to the unnatural contrasts, it looks too fake, even in 24 fps. Oh, and Frodo's cameo appearance was completely unjustified, which makes me recall that due to the excessive editing of the takes, the Shire of The Hobbit looks so different from the one in LOTR. <br/><br/>Another problem was Azog and other occasional CGI-fails. Why couldn't they choose to bring Azog to life the same way they used for the Uruk- Hai captain in Two Towers. Azog was painful to watch. It looked as if he popped out from an Xbox 360 game.<br/><br/>Of course, having read this, you might think that I absolutely hated this movie. I just kept the worst for the start. Now, onto the good side of An Unexpected Journey: 1) The dwarfs look awesome! At first, they look completely silly, but isn't that what they are? The book didn't do much in the sense of characterization, so I think Jackson definitely deserves praise for making every dwarf unique and distinguishable. By the end of the movie, you'll discern each of them, and that's not something the book had achieved. 2) It's much more loyal to the book than I ever expected it to be! That's not something you hear often. 3) Martin Freeman is awesome as Bilbo! 4) Overall, I think this is a very enjoyable movie, especially for the Tolkien fan. 5) I'm just very critical when it comes to the adaptation of one of my favorite books."
"Prekajski","9","7","17","22 December 2012"," a nice movie: EXPECTED
","I don't understand why there is so much negative review among critics. The movie is simply: very good entertainment. Yes, it is lighter and funnier than LOTR but it doesn't mean that it is worse. Characters are nicely done, the actor that plays Bilbo did a such a good job-believable and witty. Others are good as well. Each dwarf has its own trait and you can easily distinguish them. Gandalf is great, even better than in LOTR, by my humble opinion. Special effects are one step further, although I think there is too much of them. The only big problem is action scene with orcs in mines that is very confusing and fast. You feel like your head is spinning because of digital camera movement. Actually this would be my biggest minus. The story is told well and it is almost 100% by the book, which is very nice for die hard book fans. But I am sure that everybody in the theater who did not read the book enjoyed the whole movie.<br/><br/>All in all: Very good entertainment for kids and adults as well. Definitely worth seeing."

","' I'm going on an adventure ' Bilbo Baggins excitedly said as he left his home of bag-end as he began his adventure of a life-time.<br/><br/>I sat down and watched The Hobbit in 48 FPS and 3D. For a release, the cinema was actually not full. I say it was just over half, but than I thought maybe a lot of people saw this movie in 2D. Anyways, I watched the movie and almost immediately I was drawn into the movie like I was with the book.<br/><br/>The 48 FPS was very weird when I first started watching, it kind of felt like a 'Merlin' soap opera - obviously The Hobbit had much better CGI. But as the movie went on, I did get use to it - and when it comes out onto DVD, I'm sure watching it on 24 FPS will give me the LOTR feel.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has taken us on another adventure (Although this adventure I guess is set before LOTR, so should I say... taking us on another adventure - set before the first adventure that we sat down and all loved?) The actors do a phenomenal job, especially the likes of Martin Freeman who plays an excellent Bilbo and really brings out the humorous, lovable side of Bilbo. And of course Ian Mckellen reprises his role wonderfully as Gandalf The Grey!. Also not to forget some familiar faces re-appear such as Elijah Wood as Frodo and the legendary actor Christopher Lee. It was really fun to sit in the cinema, and think that Frodo in this movie was completely oblivious to the fact he would soon begin his epic journey in LOTR.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson definitely gives his own interpretation but does stay truthful to the book. One of my favorite scenes is when Gollum and Bilbo have this ' Guessing game ' and it was really fun to watch Gollum back on the screen, and the scene is once again amazing.<br/><br/>We also get very subtle hints of Smaug, which gives us this tension for the next movie... that we know Smaug is coming! Overall, it's an enjoyable, light-hearted movie but also Peter Jackson adds darker aspects in the children's fantasy book. The Hobbit really creates and sets the first adventure of the pre-sequels... and all I can really say is...<br/><br/>'We're going on an adventure' for the next 2 years :)"
"Bradash09","8","7","17","15 December 2012"," A Superb return to Middle Earth
","I thought this film was amazing, I'm going to see it again. I absolutely loved it. Martin Freeman was amazing as Bilbo Baggins and actually topped Sam as my favorite hobbit. The action scenes were amazing although they have revamped quite a few sequences from the book it's all fantastic. The best scene by far has to be the iconic ""Riddles"" scene. Personally I think that scene is one of the best scenes from all 4 films. There's only one criticism I have however and that is the dwarfs. 4-5 not only don't get their time to shine or even a couple lines although I can understand Peter Jackson's dilemma with this. Thorin, Balin, Bofur, Dwalin, Ori, Dori, Bombur, Fili and Kili are the only ones to have either a large part or just memorable moments. The rest are forgettable and if it wasn't for the fact I've read the book, I doubt i'd remember their names. Other than that the film is outstanding with the second half being vastly superior to the first half. I highly recommend seeing this film."
"semsung68","10","7","17","14 December 2012"," Really lives up to the hype!
","As a huge LOTR fan I was really looking forward to the Hobbit. My childhood memories came all back when I saw the first trailer, I was a kid again. I really loved the book of the Hobbit and couldn't believe that they were making this film. <br/><br/>If feels like going home in the beginning, the Shire is one of the most beautiful film sets ever created, and I hope one day I will be visiting it. When I watched the opening credits and the scene's with Bilbo and Frodo I was already sold. The film looks beautiful. The prologue at the beginning was stunning and really interesting. It gave a good perspective and background story to some of the dwarfs, especially Thorin. When the unexpected party arrives at Bilbo's home you'll get a good introduction with some of the dwarfs, although I wish some of the dwarfs were given more screen time. But a great intro to the film and to the journey. The journey itself is one big action-packed ride, going from one beautiful location to the other. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman does an amazing job portraying Bilbo and you really see that during the movie Bilbo grows from a home loving and simple Hobbit to a brave and loyal companion to the dwarfs. Ian Mckellen is of course again superb as his role as Gandalf, just like Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett. I was really impressed with the performance of Richard Armitage as Thorin. A really hardened and angry dwarf with an interesting past. I think the relationship between Thorin and Bilbo was really well executed and you'll see it progress during the film. And as for the dwarfs, I loved them all. Really fun and interesting characters that keep a smile on your face right until the end of the film. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson you've done it again, you created a masterpiece. This film kept me entertained right to the very end. I can't wait until the next one. <br/><br/>Brilliant and beautifully executed! 10/10"
"bedelian","10","7","17","14 December 2012"," Absolutely Enthralling
","Too tired to make a thorough review right now as I just watched the premiere. But I will say this movie was excellent. The fantasy and story of it drew me deep within the realm of the Lord of the Rings, which I hadn't visited in years.<br/><br/>I will say this. People have to realize that The Hobbit is very different from the Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings was meant to be a mythology, the Hobbit is more of a light-hearted fantasy story. As such, it has many more formalist aspects. The characters, events, and action are all much more exaggerated than the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>My only criticism is the same criticism I had of the original movies, Gollum. I love Andy Serkis, but I have always felt the movie Gollum greatly falls short of the power of his character. There are 2 reasons for this. For one, they tried to make him a comic relief. Gollum is not supposed to be funny, he's supposed to be scary. And two: there's no contrast in his craziness. Gollum is supposed to be scary because of the way he reacts to the ring. It is his obsession, and when you take away his obsession he becomes irate. However, for the movie's Gollum, he's always at 100%, so when his ring becomes threatened, he just seems his normal crazy self. He would seem more crazy if he were slightly more dialed down most of the time, and then psychotic when he realizes the ring is taken.<br/><br/>Any way, that's something I've wanted to say for a while. Overall it was an amazing movie, and Gollum didn't diminish this."

","As a follower of Tolkien, I went to watch the Hobbit with anticipation. There were a few really good parts, but most of it I was very disappointed with. After what Peter Jackson did to the Lord of the Rings series, I expected him to do a GREAT job with this one but I couldn't have been more wrong. I would suggest to Jackson to send the movie back and have some of the questionable scenes edited to reflect the mood and story in the book. He also seems to really like battle scenes so much that he had to invent some that were not even in the book. By the time all 3 movies are done, it will be a total of 9 hours, and we are talking about a 300 page book."
"XweAponX","10","4","8","19 January 2015"," What if we Sit on them and Squash them into Jelly?
","That's what I would like to do to the Trolls who are attacking every positive review in here (probably using multiple IDs). We'd have quite a glob of squished IMDb trolls, maybe enough to satisfy even the Three Trolls of Trollshaw.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson once again visits Hobbiton and takes us with him, this time for real, as they have left the Hobbiton set standing. In my mind only Jackson could have made this, just like only he, an unlikely Director, could have made the first (Or rather, Second) Trilogy. Is ""The Hobbit"" a 200-page book? No, actually it is more like 986, at least in i-Books. Regardless of book length on paper or in Bytes, what is forgotten is that ""The Hobbit"" is simply one very small part of a much larger story written by Tolkein which included ""The Hobbit"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""The Silmarillon"", and several collections of ""Lost Tales"". If you are not interested in the whole of Tolkein's Awesome Creation, then maybe these trilogies are not for you. As this story never really begins, and never really ends, I can live with these very short in perspective sorties into Middle Earth that these films afford us. Jackson has handed us a window into Middle Earth, a doorway in fact. We can either enter and enjoy it as it is, or spend our time using multiple IMDb accounts trying to drag this film and the others down. Me, I prefer to enjoy them, and write about why I enjoyed them.<br/><br/>First off, I don't think Two Hours and Forty-Nine Minutes are enough. And in fact, the extended version is over three hours. And that is almost enough, at least for this first part.<br/><br/>We are given an illustrated history of how the Dragon ""Smaug"" (Benedict Cumberbatch/Khan) took down the town of Dale while getting at the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor for it's Gold, and the unhappy history of Thror, the King Under the Mountain, and his son Thrain, and grandson and subject of this film, Thorin Oakenshield, named for the Oaken Branch he used while fighting the Orc ""Azog the Defiler"". This all given to us by Ian Holm as ""Old Bilbo"", in a note to Frodo (Elijah Wood, looking very much as he did almost 15 years ago).<br/><br/>This gives us something to grab onto, since The Hobbit is the same story as Lord of The Rings. It gives us a continuity as Old Bilbo reminisces of a time 60 years past - At which point Bilbo meets Gandalf, who looks basically the same as he did in Lord of the Rings - When he was still Gandalf the Gray. Enter 13 Dwarfs led by Thorin, who ""Blunt the Knives and Bend the Forks"" while eating all of Bilbo's food - Of which Bombur doesn't use a knife, eating blocks of Cheese whole.<br/><br/>One thing these films have more of, and even more in the extended editions, are the delightful Songs of Middle Earth, mostly in the same form as they are in the books, even a few from Lord of the Rings that we missed in those films.<br/><br/>As far as young Bilbo is concerned, Martin Freeman portrays a much different Bilbo at first, and as the films proceed the mannerisms start becoming more like Old Bilbo. I was expecting 13 Dwarfs much like Gimli, but we never saw any Young Dwarfs in Lord of the Rings. Apparently they look very Human until they start digging for Gold and their noses grow. These are all relatively Young Dwarfs save Balin, and they show his progression from being younger in Flashback.<br/><br/>This was Middle Earth as it was before the end of The Third Age, there was more Magic, this was reflected in the look of Elves and of Rivendell, even of Orcs, Goblins, and Trolls, all riding Wargs. By the time of Frodo, much of this magic had been subdued.<br/><br/>By my second viewing I was better able to see which effects and characters were practical and which CGI, there are a lot of practical shots and Miniatures. What we are offered here is a level far beyond Lord of the Rings, it works because that is how the story is.<br/><br/>After the party gets abducted by the Trollshaw Trolls, the film veers away from the book somewhat, expanding the role of Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy). Or merely telling us more than is told in the book, not necessarily adding more than is in The Hobbit, merely foreshadowing things to come in Lord of the Rings- such as The Release of The Witch King of Angmar and the rest of ""The Nine"", further trying the loose ends of Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>There is one little thing about Stone Giants, I thought this had been made up and added, in fact, Gandalf talks about it briefly in the book. Once we get into Goblin Town and Bilbo meets Gollum, it is the heart of the story, ""Riddles in the Dark"". Maybe Guillermo del Toro had something to do with the look of the Stone Giants, feels like his handiwork. To be Continued."

"popandcrackcorn","6","4","8","24 April 2013"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey unless you read the book which was forty times shorter and for children.
","Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic movie, but only if you've read the Silmarillion and drew obscene pictures of elves as a kid. Otherwise this massive undertaking to bring the classic children's book to life is as convoluted as a trans gender midget in clown make-up that only washes VW buses for a living. While this level of depth worked perfectly for Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's absolutely ridiculous in a movie based off a book that was created to maintain an eight year old's attention span. <br/><br/>I love Tolkien, and I'll go toe-to-toe with anyone regarding Middle Earth trivia but The Hobbit was a first attempt children's book by a master linguist who wrote it as he went along. Look at the first two chapters of the book and you'll see there's a natural narrator that somehow disappears as Tolkien starts to find confidence in his ability to craft the story. It's simple and fun, and that's what makes it such a great lead-in to his epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. Unfortunately for Jackson's wallet, Tolkien's The Hobbit isn't nearly as detailed as his great masterpiece, which forces Jackson to pull out every back story he could to warrant three years of merchandising all because King Kong sucked as bad as Jack Black in the Pit Fall commercial. <br/><br/>So going into it, you should know that 75% of the film has nothing to do with the original book and is full of abstract back story that you can only find in the comment section of the appendix section of the Silmarillion. Now if you don't know what that massively long book is about, then congratulations on having fun in college. It was a culmination of all of Tolkien's background work in creating the world of Middle Earth, and is awe-inspiring to say the least. It also helped guide him into singlehandedly creating fantasy fiction as we know it today. But The Hobbit was his first attempt, and made for children, not Harry Knowles. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first three hour entry to a trilogy that is based off of a 320 page book, which adds up to a nine overall hour film derived from a book that can be read by an elementary school teacher in less than four, according to yahoo answers which is never wrong.<br/><br/>I hate to knock The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, because as a Tolkien dork, I loved it. I felt goosebumps while watching some of my most nostalgic memories come to life, such as the troll battle and riddle game with Gollum. But in typical Jackson style, he altered these classic moments so that they were almost indistinguishable from the original version just like that prick George Lucas, post 1985. If you don't believe me, go back and read the troll scene and then compare how close to the original it stayed. Or find one single mention of Radagast riding a sled of bunnies anywhere in The Hobbit, or Lord of the Rings for that matter, and I'll forgive Jackson's insult of leaving out Beorn the shape-shifter or Bombadil (I realize he was in the LOTR, but I can still harbor resentment). <br/><br/>Still as I said before, I enjoyed the movie and must give credit where it's due, and there were many things that worked including the superb cast. The fantastic Martin Freeman starring as the young Bilbo Baggins was stellar as expected, as he's mainly known for respected roles in original series like The Office and Sherlock, among others. Furthermore the rest of the cast is engaging and really embraces their fantastical roles, particularly the forty five dwarfs whom I'm not going into detail about because there's too many. Also watching the early stages of Gandalf, played perfectly by Sir Ian McKellen, was refreshing and brought a greater impact when you go back to watch the LOTR trilogy. It's also impossible to fault Jackson completely as a director, simply by how he maintained the basic ties to the themes that worked from the LOTR's series, such as the beautiful cinematography and incomparable score by the great Howard Shore. <br/><br/>Still the film was confusing and unfocused. While the earlier trilogy was complex and could also be seen as overwhelming, LOTR centered on a small cast of heroes that we rooted for and a clear cut villain, and so was easier to follow. With The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, we have the entire cast of the Keystone Cops to keep up with, not to mention a hodgepodge of orc leaders mixed with the mysterious darkness in Mirkwood, as well as Smaug the Dragon, whom the eleven year old that forces me to eat crème horns after midnight can't wait to see. Then you have to remember that most of the plot development has yet to happen, which makes this first installation pretty much three hours of listening to a bunch of dwarfs spinning yarns to a hobbit who gives about a much of a damn as you did before you found out your grandfather really worked as a women's shoe salesman in Albuquerque during Iwo Jima.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was a fun film to watch if you have any idea who the Witch-King of Angmar or Gary Gygax is. I won't lie that I personally enjoyed the movie, but my nine year old nephew, who had just read the book to get ready for opening night, walked away having a better understanding of how itemized tax deduction works than what we just sat through. So wait till all three versions have come out in three years, and watch it all at one time. Or just buy the original Rankin/Bass Production on vinyl here, or the 1977 movie version because it's awesome and doesn't involve knowing who Mithrandir is."
"houghtonetet","9","4","8","26 January 2013"," The Hobbit: Pretty much as expected
","After the critical acclaim and commercial success of the Lord of the Rings movies, it was somewhat inevitable that the Hobbit would also be given the big screen treatment. It remained to be seen whether the smaller book, the prequel, would be exploited to the max by the producers, but as it turned out, this is what happened.<br/><br/>It is a little sad to report that the story has been sacrificed to the lust for gold, perhaps New Line execs all possess Dwarvish Rings of Power! The book is shorter and much lighter in tone than the LotR but the movie doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a fairy story written for children or epic myth. The scenes I enjoyed most were of the former flavor, but it is understandable that the director, a lifelong Tolkien fan himself, should want to tie the film in as closely as possible with LotR, and indeed with some material also from Unfinished Tales.<br/><br/>Personally, I would rather the film had been a little shorter, and spread over two episodes at the most, not three.<br/><br/>I felt most of the changes made to the story itself worked rather well, for example, Gandalf freezing the trolls by breaking a rock to catch them by surprise. Some did not, for example, the stone giants almost killing the company rather than them being in the distance. Some of the additions worked, for example, the White Council meeting, some did not, for example, everything involving Azog and Radagast. The spying mission on Dol Guldur worked, (but I always thought it was Gandalf and not Radagast who did the spying).<br/><br/>The acting was good, Martin Freeman was agreeable as the hero and the Dwarfs were all engaging and likable (I couldn't pick out a favourite, but Balin stood out in the crowd). The book I felt did not develop the Dwarfs too well as characters, but the movie was more successful in bringing their characters to life. Hugo Weaving, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis all reprised their LotR roles with no suffering of continuity.<br/><br/>My favourite scene was the party at Bag End, which was the correct genial tone for the movie as a whole, and should have been continued. I also particularly enjoyed the riddle game and the rescue by the Eagles. I did not like the CGI excesses in Goblintown, which put me in mind of the absurd dinosaur stampede in King Kong. I know the audience must suspend belief a little, but that scene was stretching it quite a bit! My teenaged offspring who saw it with me hugely enjoyed it, but they had not read the book. I know the book and the entire Middle-earth legend very well indeed and I must say this film was almost a success, but not quite. 9/10."
"dfle3","6","4","8","23 January 2013"," Saturday arvo matinée fare...62.5+%
","It takes a little while, but eventually this movie does make the prospect of seeing more in the series interesting. Roughly 30 odd minutes. That first half hour is a real chore to watch and you wonder if you have the stomach for another two and a bit hours of it. In it you have Bilbo Baggins (as an old Hobbit...still played by Martin Freeman?) narrate some events which he was not a witness to in order to introduce us to the adventures he had as a young Hobbit as a result. I was actually wondering if the entire movie would be like a bedtime story! All this alternates in that first half hour with scenes of the old Bilbo at his home with his son Frodo (just Googled him...""adoptive heir"" is the phrase used to describe him), preparing for some ""party"". It's all just so incredibly dull...perfunctory dialogue and action which just makes you question why it so lovingly depicted. In fact, the dialogue is just uninspired...low level writing...not showing but saying.<br/><br/>Things don't improve that much when Bilbo is imposed upon by a small band of dwarfs, including their prince, Thorin (played by Richard Armitage). Thorin plans to reclaim his ancestral home from a covetous dragon. The dwarfs intend Bilbo to help them do this...something which Bilbo is understandably reluctant to agree to. The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) is set on having Bilbo join the adventure in any case. It's as tiresome and annoying to watch this deluge of dwarfs in Bilbo's house as it is for Bilbo, who likes his house to be neat. And when the dwarfs sing...hmm...entertainment ain't what it used to be!<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is almost ready to redeem itself...but not before having some perfunctory action scenes. Not sure whether the flaws of the movie are the flaws of the book (not having read either of Tolkien's famous novels but enjoying the previous ""Rings"" trilogy...especially the second, which knows how to stage engrossing action scenes), but the film does not come across as great art. It's more like adequate Saturday afternoon matinée fare...and on that level it delivers...albeit in just under three hours! Whilst the early part of the movie comes across as a children's fairytale, the latter part of the movie is pitched more at adults...there is some violence which I think would not be suitable to a very young audience, perhaps.<br/><br/>At some point the movie rises above these humble beginnings and makes you want to follow the story down the road. After the great work of the ""Rings"" trilogy by the same maker (Peter Jackson), The Hobbit seems like a precursor work where those involved find it hard to reach the right tone. Richard Armitage's Thorin at times seems nothing but poses. Cate Blanchett's character of Galadriel doesn't seem to capture the ethereal tone she set much better in the ""Rings"" trilogy. And the quizzical elvin poses seem style over substance often times too...suggesting dogs...or Spock. All this just adds to the sense of a story full of action which signifies nothing.<br/><br/>Sad to say, these weren't the only times I found proceedings just plain silly. Imagine my surprise when told that dragons ""covet gold""! M'kay. When the stone giants fight, that just seems pure popcorn from a Saturday arvo matinée with no pretensions of greatness. With such silliness going on, the at times solemnity and earnestness is an odd fit for this kind of story.<br/><br/>Since this trilogy will be a prequel to the ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy, I now wish that I had remembered more of the story of the ring in that previous trilogy. It's also a pity that some of Gollum's intriguing riddles are difficult to understand and so are missed because the movie wants Gollum to be quite ""Other"". Hopefully the DVD will have subtitles!<br/><br/>It was interesting to read the disclaimer at the end of the movie about no animals being harmed in the making of this movie. I think that that is what was stated. That might be false advertising as this movie has been in the news prior to its release for the number of animals that died during the making of it...goats and horses, I believe.<br/><br/>Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, hopefully things will improve from here on in. Currently it seems like a glorified ""B"" movie, with hammy acting and some nothing dialogue. But it would take a pretty bad sequel for me to give up on the trilogy.<br/><br/>It must be noted though that the cinematography and special effects are a treat...an award for the latter would be deserved, if not the former...but I do like ""Life of Pi"" for that honour."
"nursekate","8","4","8","19 January 2013"," The Dwarf who stole the show
","Firstly I have to say that I actually think the hobbit is not a well written book. In my opinion too much is left unsaid both in regards to characters and plot. It is very episodic which is why it lent itself so well to Jackanory where I first heard it. I loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the film reintroduced me to the books many years after I first read them.<br/><br/>Anyway to the film which I treated my family to on Boxing day. We watched it in 3D 48fps. It was just awesome (I hate that word but it seems to fit) the detail and clarity like nothing I've seen before. I have always hated 3D but not here I felt immersed in the action.<br/><br/>I I loved the opening scenes telling us the Dwarfs history and setting up the reason for Thorin's quest something that I don't think the book explains. It was also a nice nod to LOTHR to have Bilbo and Frodo talking about the past.<br/><br/>I enjoyed how Gandalf and the Dwarfs are introduced in keeping with book but with some tweaks so we see all the different dwarfs arrive before the focus switches to Thorin. I liked the way they delayed his entrance making his arrival dramatic – immense almost.<br/><br/>One of the things that the film does by having the Azog storyline is provide a link between all the individual episodes in the novel which for me at least is no bad thing.<br/><br/>I loved seeing Rivendel it was my favourite set in the original film, however I felt the white council scenes dragged the film down.<br/><br/>I must be the only person underwhelmed by riddles in the dark. I think because I knew it was coming and that it would play out as it does in the book it just didn't excite me. If this had been filmed before LOTR it would have been different because Golem would have blown me away. Having said all of that I did love Bilbo deciding not to kill Golem.<br/><br/>The Goblin scene was very fast and thrilling and I can see the video game comparisons but I still liked it. I especially liked the way the Goblin King taunts Thorin. I wasn't bothered by his last line either. Barry Humphries did a great job.<br/><br/>The final scene cinematically was amazing. Thorin coming out of the tree was just amazing. The audience around me seemed really caught up in the moment.<br/><br/>Performance wise I enjoyed Martin Freeman he played his usually everyday character and that is right for Bilbo. Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis were as good as they were originally. I loved Ken Stott as Balin his narration of the attack by the orcs is just brilliant as is his conversation with Thorin.<br/><br/>But this film was stolen by Richard Armitage. Peter Jackson and co gave him the character's bare bones on paper and boy how he ran with it. I was just amazed at how good he was; making Thorin a very much more complex character than his book counterpart. It was a master class in how to portray a conflicted flawed man (dwarf). Every word and gesture showed something of Thorin's character. He just dominated the screen even when he wasn't speaking. <br/><br/>Sadly I have only been able to see this once but I will certainly be getting the DVD and I am guessing there will be a lot of repeat viewings"

","I was waiting for something much more that i was getting. First of all i didn't know it was going to be another trilogy, so my expectations where higher than ""first piece of trilogy"" but still...<br/><br/>Boooring: Some of the scenes, like visit at the rivendell was so boring i was going to fall a sleep.. Nothing but talking over and over same things i have seen in this movie all ready.. But maby it really was just in case someone did fall a sleep so they know where we are going when they wake up.. And the goblin scene was all so way too long, even the running in the end went on and on, i was like ""will they ever find the door out?"" Bland: i was waiting for great massive fights, in the start i was hoping to see a dragon.. well more than just a tail or in the end an eye.. I was hoping to see great emotions; love, suffer, courage.. sow really none of em.. Thorin.. Well he just had a bad day, or few...<br/><br/>The story line it self wasn't so complicated that i could have not fit in 3 hour movie. I think 1 hour would have been enough but no.. 9 hours?? what the hell? When i walked out from the movie, i really felt like i was robbed! I watched for 3hour trailer/pre taste of a movie thats coming and i payed 12 for it.. god damn! In the story, there really happened much. ""Loose kingdom, loose folk, go to quest, see the elf's, see the goblins, find the ring, fight the orcs.."" and well thats about it... And some parts didn't even come together; what was the stone giants about? Just an accident? No-one did really notice that there even was one.. well they didn't talk about em at all! <br/><br/>Fuzzy: Still breaching about the fights. I have seen so bad fight scenes last time in some B-class movies from back 80's it was terrible! 0,1 sec. you see a hand, 0,1 sec. you see some blood, 0,1 sec you see a leg and it gos on like that, you really cant tell what happens in that fight and for me that means a Bad fight scene.. Alltho i wasn't waiting for ninja/tekken chind of battle, but still it was all just fuzzying in my head, and in 3D it was even worse..<br/><br/>All reviews of this movie i see who's a fan or who's not because the ones that really know anything about movies say it was poo, and the fans yell GREAT!!! but just to clear my side here, I went to watch Life of Pi just days before i saw this one, and no wonder Life of Pi was 2nd most Oscar nominated movie."
"kxoadinn","8","4","8","13 January 2013"," Very Entertaining
","Good adaptation of Tolkien's book, well-fitting with the earlier Lord of the Rings films. Overall very satisfying. The visual sweep and grandeur of this film conveys everything I would expect from a filmic adaptation of Tolkien. Especially impressive (as in the LOTR trilogy) were the scenes in the Shire (I wish I could live in a human-sized version of Bilbo's underground dwelling!), and, of course, Rivendell. The ""Riddles in the Dark"" sequence was nearly perfect.<br/><br/>There were a few drawbacks. To earn a ""10 out of 10"" from me, the next installment will have to do better in these areas:<br/><br/>1. Too many goofy faces. The physical appearance of the trolls, goblins, and even some of the dwarfs is borderline ludicrous. While this is fine for the trolls, who are supposed to be big and stupid and their physical features reflect such, the goblins look more like gross muppets than scary monsters, making it hard at times to take them seriously as bad guys.<br/><br/>2. The addition of scenes/elements not in Tolkien's book. The director included material from the LOTR back story to establish links between this trilogy and LOTR, but these scenes sometimes feel thrown in or (worse) seem included as space-takers so the filmmakers can stretch the text into three movies (and make bigger bucks at the box office). This ""apocryphal"" material needs to be better integrated into the main storyline.<br/><br/>I also wished the ""down down to Goblin-town"" song appeared in the movie, but this is a minor caveat.<br/><br/>I watched the film in 24fps, in 2D, so I didn't experience any of the much-ballyhooed visual difficulties attributed to other formats."
"The-Sarkologist","8","4","8","12 January 2013"," In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit
","I did want to see this movie because it was one of those 'must see movies' that appear in the cinema from time to time (and some of those movies are actually good) but I was actually surprised as to how well this movie was done. Mind you, it was good to see the stars from Lord of the Rings (such as Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee et al) return for the prequel, but it was the way the movie was made and the way that, despite being small, Bilbo strides this film like the colossus that he really is.<br/><br/>Anybody who is familiar with the book will know that Bilbo is pretty much the person that saves the day throughout the story. It is not that Bilbo is some powerful sorcerer, or even wants to be a powerful sorcerer (all he wants is to get back home so he can rest in his comfy Hobbit hole), but rather that he is quick thinking, and willing to be brave when bravery is required. For instance, Gandalf praises Bilbo who saves the company by simply keeping the trolls talking until daylight.<br/><br/>The Hobbit could have easily been done in a single film, so I am surprised that they have decided to drag it out to three films. My concern is that the third film will simply be a bridge between the end of the second film (which I suspect ends with the recapture of Lonely Mountain) and the beginning of Fellowship of the Ring. Further, unlike Lord of the Rings, which had numerous scenes from the book cut from it, The Hobbit has been inflated with a lot of other scenes. A number of these events did happen, but they do not appear in the story, and we only know about them from notes and other stories that Tolkein left behind.<br/><br/>The movie does drag on for a but, and the scene in the goblin caves in the mountain was a bit over done (I did not like the goblin king at all) but by adding another orc king as an antagonist (and I suspect that the final confrontation will come at the end of the second movie) was quite well done. I guess the thing that was spelt out a lot clearer was the fact that Thorin and his band are pretty much refugees, and that it is not a quest for gold or treasure but rather it is a quest to restore them in their homeland.<br/><br/>Mind you it was not that the dwarfs were innocent victims of a rampaging dragon, but rather because their greed had overcome their sense, which lead to the tragic downfall. In a way you can also see that Thorin is also a very flawed character, not in the sense that he wasn't well written but because he shows a nasty stubborn and unforgiving streak and it is only at the end of the film that he finally realises that Bilbo was worth bringing along."
"vrautio","7","4","8","3 January 2013"," Not that unexpected journey
","Summarizing my thoughts on the movie (may contain SPOILERS): Seeing the ""An Unexpected Journey"" made me realize that they should have sticked with the two movie plan. Three parts is one too much and it probably makes the pacing of each part a bit of a dire. Too many things which do not happen in the book, but are only there to make an arch to the LOTR. One can always whine afterward, but in my opinion LOTR could have been four parts long (last movie too quickly!), while two would have been enough for the Hobbit.<br/><br/>48fps took some time for my eyes to settle in, since for example Bilbo walking in his home looked a bit paced. They should really think about camera angles and especially distances when shooting a fast-pace action scenes. It was hard to see what was really going on in the first action scenes since they were shot too close and cut in a very distracting way.<br/><br/>Acting and sceneries were very beautiful and heart-warming, and probably the best thing in the movie."
"antomasov","10","6","14","9 January 2013"," A perfect fairytale movie for the whole family
","For me this movie is a perfect fairytale movie that I wish I could have watched back when I was a kid. I am a grown man now but watching this movie took me back to my childhood. To really appreciate this movie though you have to be 3 things: 1) A fan of fantasy world in general, or particularly a fan of the world of Middlearth. 2) Someone who will not take a movie too seriously while watching it since this movie is not meant to be a ""serious movie"". This movie is meant to be a fun lighthearted fantasy movie, a fairytale kids would enjoy. 3) Someone who knows how to enjoy a movie experience. This means leave your cynicism at your doorstep please and head out into an adventure. <br/><br/>If you are unable to do any of the 3 things I mentioned you will not like the movie. If you don't like fantasy in general and are expecting a gritty realistic story you will not like the movie. Go watch the godfather instead. If you are looking for a gritty, (overly) dark fantasy story, you will not find it here. Go watch game of thrones instead. Basically, what I am saying is, if you find the idea of a rabbit power sled that carries a goofy wizard through the forest unacceptable, then this movie is not meant for you. Too bad. A fantasy setting makes this idea not only acceptable, in such a fantasy universe, these things happen every day. Two stone giants are boxing for no apparent reason. Move along and try not to get hit by a rock. Where do you think you are, this is fantasy and it is well withing the realm of possibility. Not to mention, I find all these things cool. Watch this movie with your kids, they will love it. And one last thing, the action in this movie is meant to be fun and over the top. The good guys will run in all sorts of trouble, but will come out unharmed. The fighting and chasing scenes are creative, visually stunning and fun. Also don't be one of those parents who think the violence is too much, the violence in this movie is just right and children will find it adventurous more than anything. The villains though, some monsters might scare the kids but that is what they are there for. The design of the creatures was superb. I salute Peter Jackson for making the most fun movie that came out in the last 10 years. I like it better than Lord of the rings movies, because the LOTR trilogy had a grand and an epic story from the books to follow and there was no way to make it really bad. That is why I underestimated Peter Jackson's talent and ability. I thought ""oh well, he followed the epic story, character and location designs were already there, big deal. It was good but how could it not be?"" But Hobbit (the book) had much less grandiose story and character development than LOTR (books), but the movie exceeded my expectations. My final verdict, I like Lord of the rings books better than Hobbit the book, but I like Hobbit the movie better than Lord of the rings movies. Hobbit, the best fantasy movie to come out in a long time."
"mftuchman","4","6","14","30 December 2012"," Tedious
","The entire LotR series was done in three movies, and they couldn't finish the Hobbit in one? This slow paced clunker failed to amaze most of the people in my family, and focused too much on visuals rather than action, dialogue, plot, or character development. CGI alone does not a movie make.<br/><br/>Yet for all the tediousness of the initial dwarf visits, they failed to capture the charm of either Bilbo or the guests. It seemed that in the book they captured him with the power of adventure and the fun of being a burglar. The movie's version of the scene had all the excitement of a deposition for an estate in probate. <br/><br/>The Hobbit's plot isn't deeply complicated. A tighter, better screenplay can still be true to the spirit of the book. This one misses the mark. It just wasn't fun."
"awf002","10","6","14","30 December 2012"," Another Artistic Masterpiece by Peter Jackson
","This movie, the first in the Hobbit series, is an artistic masterpiece. I loved every second of the the ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" film series. Peter Jackson has done an outstanding job bringing Tolkein's classic book, the ""HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY"" to the screen.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way Mr. Jackson introduced us to the Brown Wizard, and to characters that were mentioned in the Lord of the Rings books but not explored in those movies. The music by Mr. Howard Shore was wonderful in this film. The acting was magnificent across the board, and the cinematography was spectacular. Costumes, makeup all deserve Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Then, there were the performances themselves, which couldn't possibly have been any better. Mr. Freeman does a superb job in the role of Bilbo, and Ian McKellen is perfect as Gandalf. A band of delightful actors played the dwarfs.

","I saw the digital HFR 3D version, not sure what to expect. I liked ""Avatar"", but there were times when the 3D in that movie was simply distracting, and to be honest I can't even recall now what it looked like, which goes to show how much of an impact it made on me.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's HFR 3D technology, though, is another thing entirely. For the first time the movie screen is an actual window into another world. In fact, I think that's the part of my visual brain that was activated by this film: the ""window"" part, not the ""movie"" part.<br/><br/>They say your brain has to learn how to interpret pictures, and it's different from interpreting the real world through your eyes. That's why ""tilt-shift"" miniaturisation works, by activating a part of your brain that has learned how to associate camera focus with distance.<br/><br/>HFR 3D is the opposite of tilt-shift. It makes the world in the film full size. You ""know"" you're looking at a real world because that's the part of your brain that Jackson has managed to reach.<br/><br/>To fully enjoy this movie, you have to learn how to watch movies all over again, and this movie makes it worth doing so. It really is a masterpiece. I'm looking forward to my future visits to Jackson's world in 2013 and 2014."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","8","6","14","22 December 2012"," Jackson's comeback?
","I find it very hard to review this title because I'm a Tolkien fanatic and one of those people who would kill to be in Peter Jackson's Middleearth. So when I heard he was filming the Hobbit I went out of my mind. Days passed, my exam weeks came and went and patiently I have waited for the day to come when I would march into the cinema with my friends to slip into Middleearth again. And on December 21st I did. So here we go:<br/><br/>1) The story. The idea of putting the Hobbit into three movies was a bit questionable, because I hadn't the slightest clue where the movies would end and begin, but I praised the idea knowing a lot had to be told. The interesting thing is that a lot more was said; segments from ""Unfinished tales"" can be found in the movie and it is a marvelous refreshment when seen. Why? Well because absolutely every page from the book (the Hobbit) is on the screen, literally. Almost every dialog, and every joke is present making it almost impossible to be dazed with it because it is well known if one has read the book. So I found the subsidiary story a lot more interesting and intriguing. Also, the entire movie lacks epic moments. This movie is just not epic. It has great potential to be epic, but when that potential starts to develop two things happen: a) everything is just ruined with CGI (there is a way more CGI than necessary, but more on that later); and b) the epic segments end to quickly.<br/><br/>2) The characters. 14 people on the screen at once. Only a few of them can get our attention - Bilbo, Balin, Gandalf and Thorin. This is not a problem related to the movie but to the book, because the book was written like that, and as I said earlier, Jackson followed it in every single step. Some magnificent roles can be found - especially Balin. The other dwarfs have their moments but when reading the book in total one has a feeling it is a lot more than can be seen in just one movie (the only REAL problem with splitting the book into three films). McKellen had, I had the feeling, a great time playing Gandalf and is enjoying the role. There a lot of other appearances by known and unknown characters so let that be a mystery until you see the movie.<br/><br/>3) The music. I will just say that Howard Shore outdid himself this time. A lot of familiar tunes spotted, but new, epic ones really get the blood flowing.<br/><br/>4) The CGI. Jesus, Mary and Joseph!!! I understand that CGI is all the rage right now, and that it is possible, because of it, to make things one could not have done before. But if we look at CGI form the LOTR it was more realistic and dazzling 10 years ago! How is that possible? Almost the entire second half of the movie feels like an animated picture from Dreamworks (not that I have anything against Dreamworks). Still, some animated pictures were more realistic than this e.g. Rango. So in the attempt to create a fairytale environment Jackson used so much CGI that just doesn't look good. In the year 2012/2013, in a movie that cosed more than New Zeland as an island, I can spot CGI on the screen! That is, for me, an unforgivable mistake and the only reason I gave the movie 8/10. <br/><br/>In conclusion. A very good movie, with great music and some fantastic performances that lacks really epic moments and looks like an animated picture. An interesting new movie, but DO NOT EXPECT LOTR on the screen. Still, I can't wait for the second part to come out."
"jmhernandezc","9","6","14","18 December 2012"," To all Harry Potter fans...
","I am a fan of J.K. Rowling and her creation, Harry Potter. Nevertheless, despite the marvelous display of imaginary of Rowling, it cannot be compared, not even slightly, to the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, whose writings were edited by 1937; Rowling, by the way, was not even born by the time books like ""The Hobbit"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Silmarillion"" were already conceived and printed. It is really daring to suggest that The Hobbit is somehow a rip off, and much less of ""Harry Potter"". Much to my amazement, I read a few commentaries of people that (with all due respect) have not the minimum idea about world literature, such as the case of ""Brian 007"" that, frankly made me laugh until my tears came out, both of sadness and pity for his commentary."
"lydiafwilliams","10","6","14","15 December 2012"," A wonderful rendition of my favourite childhood story
","I really enjoyed the Hobbit. I suspect part of my enjoyment came from entering without certain delusions. The Hobbit is a children's story, I was six or seven when I first read it whereas the Lord of the Rings, is not. Any person going to see the Hobbit and expecting the weighty seriousness of Lord of the Rings is going to be in for a shock.<br/><br/>I would argue that more seriousness did need to be injected into this film. I remember feeling tense throughout the dwarfs journey through the mountains as a child. The Goblin king, the wolves and Gollum all had an element of distinct menace as they attempted to thwart out heroes' journey. The Trolls were always humorous villains so I had no problem with Jackson's rendition of their argument but the Goblins were meant to be scary. These come across as the dorky Orcs the bigger ones bullied in the playground.<br/><br/>Now, having gone through such detail character arcs with Gollum in Lord of the Rings and having developed the audience's sympathy so fully there was less chance of making Gollum the truly sinister character he was in the novel. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the schizophrenic riddles game with Bilbo, mouthing along the lines in the cinema like a true groupie, but there were more giggles than concern for Bilbo. Hats off though for the excellent expression of Gollum's glowing blue eyes on the screen, one of the many nods to the book that had me grinning throughout this film. <br/><br/>I may have gotten weird looks when fist pumping over references to the Sacksville Bagginses and Gandalf forgetting the names of the lost blue wizards. I found myself feeling a strong connection to grumpy grey Gandalf throughout this film, it will be interesting to see that transition to the vanquishing-evil Gandalf during the face down at Dol Guldur. Hopefully there will be more development of the other dwarfs once Gandalf departs from the company and the kids are left without the supervising adult. After all, Gandalf appeared to be on the world's worst school trip, frantically counting the number of Dwarfs and muttering through their names after each near death experience.<br/><br/>Rivendell was spectacular as always, Elrond, being the stylish fashionista he is had 3 awesome costumes in the course of '2 days' and Galadriel continues to rock the ethereal white look far better than Saruman. In comparison I must say I was rather frustrated with my first look at the evil in Mirkwood. While the ruins of Dol Guldur were stunning they, and the giant spiders, would have been much more sinister at dusk rather than bright daylight. <br/><br/>I knew, when the cast was announced for the Hobbit, that there was likely to be an uncomfortable amount of dwarf perving on my behalf (using Gimli as a reference any perving could be considered an ""uncomfortable amount""). I was not wrong. Kili and Fili (Aka Merry and Pippin) were a pleasant relief on the eyes but Richard Armitage blew me away with his swirling fur trimmed surcoat. It was enough to make me wish to become one of those bearded dwarf women with him using Lord Flashart's line ""Like the beard bridesmaid, gives me something to hang onto!"" Only, Thorin would never do that. Ever. Sigh.<br/><br/>Now I will admit something that will either rally you to the common cause against an invasive menace or will have you decrying me as a backwards hobbo. I hate 3D. If I can watch a film in 2D I will pick an obscure screening time and see it then. I don't think 3D is necessary to create a good film and when it is used many directors are still so excited by the opportunity they put in shots that have little purpose other than to remind you they're in 3D. <br/><br/>So when I'm being dragged through a panoramic shot of the original Erabor, pre-fiery doom, I get really frustrated when, thanks to the 3D, my eyes can't actually pick any spot that's in focus. And when butterflies and flocks of birds flutter out of long shots of forest I want to grab a dwarven axe and splatter either them or Peter Jackson because, excuse me, I was looking at something more interesting on the screen. That being said, those were the only instances where I disliked the 3D so, 30 seconds out of almost 3 hours of movie seems a small price to pay.<br/><br/>Speaking of over use of technology, the bad CGI white Orc. The albino Uruk-Hai type thing with a Captain Hook vendetta against Thorin. Who for some reason was clean. He's an Orc! They are neither clean nor absentmindedly pet their Wargs when killing an incompetent underling, that is more in the realm of a James Bond villain. One thing noticeable from Lord of the Rings is the idea of an incorporeal menace, the evil you don't see is often more frightening than the one you do. The silhouette or voice of the White Orc giving orders to hunt down the ""dwarf scum"" would have been more effective in creating a nasty enemy than excess screen time of an unrealistic CGI character.<br/><br/>Now, whilst this review seems to be a big rant against the film, I would absolutely insist on dragging my cousin's children off to see it. I enjoyed myself throughout this film. When the Lord of the Rings films were released many fans griped about Tom Bombadil's absence, elves at Helms Deep etc. but in the end we understood the films were their own medium and rejoiced in them. The Hobbit is neither the Lord of the Rings, nor is it an exact facsimile of the novel. It is not an Elf, like the epic and long-lived Lord of the Rings, it is, in fact, a warm and cheerful Hobbit."

","100% disappointing. How these guys managed to destroy a well written and interesting story? For me it is a mystery. Tolkien was a master of storytelling but you can hardly recognize his work in this farce. Peter Jackson has lost his touch and succumbed to the temptation of believing that he could ""improve"" Tolkien's work. The result is disastrous. A boring film of excessive Holywoodesque fights and chases. Maybe some scenes could be spared; those that stick to the book, but what it is unforgivable to introduce characters and scenes just to lengthen the film and, supposedly, attract more audience. Well, don't count me in; I will surely skip The Hobbit II and The Hobbit III."

","This was the first time for me in a cinema, to get SO bored that i really wanted to leave. After an hour of complete emptiness, childish- funny times, ridiculously big and endless no point scenes, the director decided that it was finally the time that the ''big'' adventure to begin, leaving behind the ''musical with dwarfs''. Hello, it was so boring that i would get excited watching anything after THIS beginning. I must say, I love LOTR, all 3 and have watched them many times so far, BUT 10+ years after, i was expecting an evolution ed, with more complexity, great assembled film, with stunning aesthetics and a new type of scenario that would take the whole concept to a new dimension from a new approach... instead that film is like a copy paste from the original in a bad and shameless way. The cast is not to be remembered, except of course the actors from the LOTR. The only thing that saves the film is of course the graphics that are super, but for me, not in the 48 frames edition, as it loses the fairytale magic. Overall it left me bittersweet and probably not going to watch the next 2 films. It takes a lot courage to make the next step."

","Having read the Hobbit recently, it was easy for me to notice the little changes made to the story, some Tolkien fans will complain but not me!! The addition of Radagast the Brown and his sled of Rhosgobel rabbits was not only a witty idea but one I think professor Tolkien himself would say ""I wish I had thought of that!"" And the scenes with the White Council was the perfect amount of tie in to the LOTR trilogy, especially Saruman's character who masterly showed signs of the villain to come. Is he already a minion of Sauron or is his lust for power driving his agenda?? I was glad to see every dwarf had his own look and personality! The best scene for me has to be the Riddles in the Dark sequence which captured the most important part of the story to come in a way that Andy Serkis should receive a best supporting actor nomination for his portrayal of Gollum. My only complaint is I thought the 3D version seemed dark, after watching a second time in 2D I'm convinced 3D sucks and is a gimmick for more money!!! In closing if you are a true Tolkien fan like myself or just the casual fan of the LOTR you wont be disappointed with what Peter Jackson has done with a book that might lack the depth for such a trilogy!!!"

","I'll try to keep this review short and sweet. I'm not a huge LOTR fan like some. I've never read the books and I've seen the first trilogy only one time each (and I did think they were great). But what I am is a movie fanatic/sci fi fan, and movies like The Hobbit are hard to pass up.<br/><br/>First and foremost, story, CGI, acting, sound/score, all among the best. Peter Jackson knows how to take the viewer on a journey and make a fantastic looking film. The 3D in the movie is absolutely stunning. I'm not a fan of 3D but this movies special FX and even basic scenes like walking around were very convincingly done. If you get a chance to watch this in 3D, jump on the opportunity, it's worth it!<br/><br/>My only complaint about the Hobbit (as well as the other LOTR movies) I think these movies are TOO LONG!!! It's not an entirely bad thing for a film like ""The Hobbit"". But I could go for a sweet flick just under two hours. It seems like these movies drag on for far too long, and to be honest, ""The Hobbit"" is the worst of them all. There is a lot of side-track story telling in between and the movie just seems to drag on at some points. If you absolutely love these movies/books for LOTR then you probably like it being long. But as more the typical viewer, it's hard to stay interested for that long. Also, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but the way the movie ends was just kind of weird and obvious that there would be a sequel. <br/><br/>All and all, still a great film. Despite the running time this is a great film and definitely worth checking out."

They intertwined the music very well. When they showed old Bilbo they used the music they had in the first, but when in the past, they used new music. I loved the action.

","The wonder of a good walk is the wonder of these stories about our shared journey. It may not always look like the places we have been, but it sure feels like it on the journey. We begin at home with the visitors and their strange ways and nagging demands on our time . What a fun individual crew they will turn out to be . We are surely, like them , destined to enjoy our differences and celebrate our uniqueness. This scene though breaks up and we find ourselves alone again ; longing to be in a place that's just like home. We like to be together , but we need our day of rest . God bless them mums; they do the dishes ; this Hobbit home maybe only ever just a flighty fantastic fantasy, but its sure serious fun to be there at such times of sharing. The formed and fashioned friendships too remind us too of what we can do together in the toughest of times by being strong in ourselves. Who would ever forget Golon and his lonely, precarious life and reasoning; Naked and exposed, he's us all over. I hope Peter and the team will capture the real blackness of some of the remaining dark tunnels in the next edition by telling the story as Job does in his chapter about the mine. If there was one thing I missed in all the action in the Hobbit - it was ""the words"" . Galdalf says a few powerful things - his power is not much in the magic but in his understanding - when he says ""the world can change if we all spin the moment"" he's pointing to really big picture positive stuff that the kids of today really need http://dogood.blogspot.com. Yes we are all creatures who dig, but we dig differently in diverse places and spaces . We get different amounts of ""gold"" and we all get distracted by "" fools gold"", forgetting that Gold is always a gift and can be found just about anywhere . The tangible and real adventure for all of us is to find gold in places we have personally discovered deep in in our own lonely journeys into dark places . The films limits? At times I think the re-creators are too busy with lights, mirrors and action to push the punchy place of the words that really powerful men speak. Peter Jackson has done very well to bring us these wonders . I wish the team well as they send us down again into the depths and the darkness. The wonder of these journeys and their potential to motivate is that,just like even in Plato's cave ,the light is ever present, despite the darkness and the depth of trauma .With light and understanding out there, there is no reason to stay at home in a cave all the time. Peter you have done very very well to both take us there and bring us home again. The West sure needs to re-find that place of rest again."

","A fantasy film produced to the highest possible standards. The music swells and toots with power, the cast offers charming and hilarious performances, and the set design, effects, costumes and props are all meticulously reproduced.<br/><br/>Leisurely paced, and filled with action set pieces, to keep the film flowing, it rarely drags, except for the several false starts at the beginning. It is wonderfully shot, landscapes and city shots are particularly beautiful. The special effects, a huge part of this film, are well done, computer generated characters are particularly impressive, their faces having full range of expression. The script is a little underwritten, as is the story, to really validate the running time, but there is enough going on on screen to make the time go by.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman's performance is more than serviceable, his facial expressions and exasperation are amusing, and his deadpan entirely fitting to the part. Ian McKellen inhabits his role as expected. The dwarfs, awash with regional accents, are distinct and carry enough charm, freely mixing humour and drama as needed.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is its formulaic precision. As action builds and our heroes' situation becomes untenable, they will be saved right in the nick of time by a Gandalf, elves, dwarfs etc, whoever. After each action sequence, queue dramatic music and several shots of the beautiful rugged landscape; the same with the introduction of each character: queue an introductory shot and the orchestra swells, in particular Galadriel and Elrond.<br/><br/>If I was younger and less cynical I would commend this work for its sheer size and ambition; a masterpiece of film-making."

","'The Hobbit' is impressive. Very impressive. I remember to have read a lot of somewhat negative comments about the Hobbit first. But comparing the Hobbit with the The Fellowship of the Ring is a KO for the later. The 3 hours reveal much more about Hobbits and Dwarfs culture and their attitudes than every other Tolkien based movie. Martin Freeman and mostly every other actor did a great job, though IanMcKellen's performance seemed as he was a little bit tired, whereas Sylvester McCoy as Radagast was just amazing. Nearly every 'new' character is a great addition. The already well-known characters had quite short appearances therefore. Tolkien fans will find a lot of déjà vu moments, newcomers have probably the best introduction into Tolkiens universe, funny moments go hand in hand with stunning action scenes and the ever wonderful ambiance. Only 9/10 as I found some flaws. For example Gandalf. He seems to play his role as savior much too frequently this time. My impression - the plot felt too constructed. And of course, as LOTR is the successor of The Hobbit, a NEW huge political plot cant be expected. After an hour the story really flattens out a bit and the turbulent action-driven tour begins. But this were just small flaws in a overall mind-dazzling fantasy tale with great adventurers."

"pererau","6","9","24","16 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected(ly Bad) Journey
","I don't have time for a full review, now - I'll try to add more later if I can, but I was majorly disappointed. My wife and I just finished re watching the full 12 hours of LotR to get back into Middle Earth, and enjoyed it immensely. After watching the Hobbit last night, I'm infinitely glad that it didn't get made first, because otherwise I may not have had interest in seeing LotR.<br/><br/>The plot of the Hobbit is plodding, wandering, with a stated purpose that is never really explored, and motivation that is upheld by the weakest of threads. The special effects are no better - and maybe worse - than from 10 years ago, and the scenes that are meant to be light-hearted are just silly without being funny, while the scenes that are meant to be epic are so over-wrought as to stretch beyond the reasonable borders of suspension of disbelief. I can't count the number of times I thought (and by the end of the movie, said aloud) ""yeah, right, whatever"" when some other implausible battle scene occurs in which they escape from inescapable places just because the movie feels like they should. Gandolf seems to have no power, but then, at the moment where the script decides that maybe he should do something helpful, he can suddenly do whatever is required, only to be powerless 10 seconds later except to yell ""run!"" Or ""this way!"" How many times in one movie can one character strike a hero pose? I didn't count, because my fingers and toes don't go up that high, but maybe you can let me know when you watch Thorin throughout the movie. I get that he is supposed to be this film's Aragorn, but all he does is strike a ponderous pose with his hand on his hip. Also, Martin Freeman is supposed to be Bilbo, but all he does is take Arthur Dent to Middle Earth. Over and over again, you are expected to care for this fellowship of the poorly motivated random folk, and fear for them in increasingly implausible scenarios. In reality, each subsequent action scene made me care less and less: ""oh, here's another scene of inescapable death in which the bad guys will lose hundreds and one of the Dwarfs will walk away with a slightly bruised left patella that will heal by nightfall. Yawn."" I could go on.<br/><br/>It isn't all bad - the music is spectacular, and fortunately is nearly omnipresent for the entire 600 hour running time of the film, and some of the panoramas and other sweeping cinematography is brilliant. Also, I genuinely belly-laughed a few times at some pretty good lines (hint: none of them came from the Dwarfs, whose lines were written by a six year old). Also, at one point Galadrial and Gandolf are talking by themselves. When you watch the film, imagine Galadrial giving Gandolf a shove. Given the nature of what they are saying this made me laugh out loud. The scene between Bilbo and Gollum is the best scene in the film, but unfortunately the sound is a little off, making it hard to hear and enjoy Gollum's riddles. I could have used more of that interaction and about an hour and a half less of the rest of the movie<br/><br/>I have much more I could say, but I just don't have the time, so this will have to suffice. Any true fan of Middle Earth needs to see this film, but not because its a marvelous piece of filmmaking; rather, you should see it simply to feel immersed in Middle Earth once again: in other words to get your high. Lord of the Rings was the gateway drug, but as usually happens with drug dealers, they get you hooked, and then give you the watered- down junk.<br/><br/>A barely passable and overlong movie that progresses at a plodding pace and repeatedly fails to deliver. Ultimately, it can't decide if it wants to be a children's book or a sweeping epic, and thus fails on both counts. It breaks my Middle Earth-loving heart, but this film only merits 5/10, and most of that for the fantastic score and the joy of being back in Middle Earth once more."
"jonathan-e-denny","7","9","24","14 December 2012"," The Hobbit is big, yet falls short of the required height.
","Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" has long been in my watch list. Being a huge Tolkien fan and a very big fan of Jackson's previous films, I was ever so eager to watch The Hobbit.<br/><br/>While overall I found it to be a good movie, there were too many things that just didn't work and should have been done differently.<br/><br/>I want to keep this review short and down to the point, kind of like a hobbit don't you think? So let's go through some pros and cons.<br/><br/>PROS: 1. The Beginning. The entire movie up till the company meets Radagast is absolutely fabulous. Jackson hit gold on the whole Bag-End scene with the Dwarfs. 2. The Acting, especially Martin Freeman as Bilbo. He was fantastic, as was Mr. Thornton as Thorin (sorry...I could resist that N&S reference.) 3. The Dwarfs. I was very impressed how they were able to make each of the 13 dwarfs unique and didn't put some in the darkness. All had plenty of screen time. 4. The Music. Howard Shore. Need I say more?<br/><br/>CONS: 1. The CGI. It was just not well done and I honestly expected more from WETA. The orcs looked so fake, as did other things and they should have, in my opinion, stuck with real life actors as orcs as they did in LOTR. 2. The added stories from the Appendices, mainly Azog. This took away from the original story and it was all rather pointless in my opinion. 3. Radagast. As much as he was funny and entertaining, he totally took away from the story and really should have been left out. 4. At one point of the movie I was totally bored....Something I never really experienced in LOTR. So the con here was overall, the movie wasn't LOTR standard and you could see that in many areas.<br/><br/>So overall, ""The Hobbit"" is an average movie. There were many things that did the book justice and I really appreciated that. However, they messed up on a lot and overall it didn't do the book and the Lord of the Rings movies justice. See the film for yourself and state your opinion. I will see the next films hoping Jackson makes up for the ground he kind of lost."

","Timid Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is recruited by wizard Gandalf the Grey to accompany a dozen dwarfs on a quest to wrest their home back from a usurping dragon called Smaug.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson revisits Middle Earth with some new friends and not a few old ones, in a film which recaptures much of the visual impact of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. So, right from the start, it is possible to say that if you didn't like those films, you are definitely not going to like this one, because it is pitched right at the same target.<br/><br/>After a prologue explaining Smaug's arrival and the displacement of the dwarfs, here is Howard Shore's music, with the familiar Shire and Ring themes, taking us through the front door of Bag End just before Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday party, thus linking us right at the start with the previous trilogy. This is all very pleasing and comforting. Bilbo's recollections take us back in time to the arrival of Gandalf and the dwarfs, and after the conference (an amusing sequence which, nevertheless, takes far too long), the expedition is off.<br/><br/>I can't say this film is too long, because I enjoyed every minute and it held my attention throughout. What I can say, though, is that the source material is much more slight than LOTR, and that shows through: there is a sense that the material has been extended, inflated, perhaps even bloated, to create a trilogy where one film or, at most, two would have been adequate. In LOTR, a long journey was necessary in order for the debilitating effect of the Ring to be demonstrated: there is no such justification here, and there is a sense of characters being marched through video game sequences.<br/><br/>That isn't all that's wrong with it. Some of the humour - welcome after the relatively humourless LOTR - is woefully contemporary in its delivery. Some of the CGI is simply off - just a bit, but it somehow fails to completely convince (the Goblin King, in particular, fails on both these grounds) and there are times when CGI is used where Jackson would have not used it in LOTR - orc and goblin facial articulation in particular - where the physical version would be better than the cybernetic. Sometimes the sizes of characters mismatch, but LOTR was guilty of that, too. The dwarfs all look like men in prosthetic makeup. And sometimes the set pieces don't work in the way they did in LOTR because the stakes don't seem as high - the Balrog sequence in Fellowship was intense, exciting and emotional because we knew the characters and cared for them: here we hardly care at all when 9 million goblins chase a dozen identikit dwarfs through their caverns in an overblown sequence. And the 3D, in the 24fps version, at least, is hardly noticeable much of the time and sequences which should have sung in 3D remain almost dull. For me, a 3D fan of vast enthusiasm, the 3D here was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>After those criticisms, it is only fair to report that the film is mostly fairly exciting, Ian McKellen and (especially) Cate Blanchett nail Gandalf and Galadriel again (McKellen's Gandalf is subtly younger and less serious), Martin Freeman's diffident everyman personality is perfect for young Bilbo, and Gollum is superbly realised in the Riddles In The Dark sequence.<br/><br/>This isn't the triumph it should have been, but I must reserve my final judgement for the next two years until I see how it fits into the trilogy."

","OK so this movie is one I have been waiting for since forever. so I was glad to go to the first screening of it in my local town yesterday. I have seen the lord of the rings trilogy many multiple times in cinema DVD and blu-ray. I had mu share of criticism with regard to the special effects in the LOTR trilogy. the thing I hated the most was the fact that many of the CG animation seems to be unnaturally 'glued' to the scene plus some of the animations were simply out of sync with the camera moment. A decade later, I thought to my self that this animation weird behavior will surely be gone. I was mistaken, this Hobbit even made it worse. I have come to a conclusion that no matter how much money was spent, Peter Jackson just makes finished products that are not polished enough. yes, I blame this issue on him completely. in this day and age there is no reason to sit in a theater and feel the scene was shot with a green screen. most of the look and feel of the movie is kinda strange, I watched the 3D 48fps version. I think I will have to wait for the 2D version to see if it was the 48fps which gives this strange atmosphere or if it was PH that failed once again. with regard to the 3D effect, this is really really annoying and I felt that this was once again a marketing hype. there was nothing special in seeing this movie in 3D as there are no scenes I felt required 3D. now for the cast: I really thought Elijah Wood was a bad choice of Frodo but Martin Freeman who PJ praised in numerous occasions and plays young Bilbo almost topped him (in a bad way). I did not feel he is such a good hobbit and I am pretty sure may other actors could do the part better. the rest of the cast is actually good, the dwarfs, elves, wizards etc the length of the movie is not proportional, the movie could have been shot as a single part and would save us the 2 year wait for the rest of the trilogy. all in all it is a decent movie that is entertaining but if you are a fan you are bound to be somewhat disappointed..."

The film tells the history of a hobbit who lives a normal and quiet life in the shire, but everything changes when he meets Gandalf, The Gray and the thirteen members of the company of Thorin, Oak Shield and starts an unexpected journey, passing by a lot of adventures and facing a lot of battles, places and fantastic creatures with the company."

The basic dramatic tension between him, the dwarfs, the elves and the orcs never has any feeling or emotion and the last shot is a set up for a sequel instead of a story ending. <br/><br/>Ironically, it's a type of overproduced b-grade trash that you'd think you'd see from New Line or the old Canon Group company. An impressive movie visually, but forgettable, mishandled and meaningless. In my humble opinion, the Pixar writers and and directors should have been brought in to improve the material, as many of the ""acting"" scenes in this long-form computer graphics movie feel extraneous or empty. <br/><br/>Lastly, I object to this films exclusively white male cast and narrative, and the fact that the New Zealand public contributed nearly 200 million dollars in tax relief for the Warners production to be made in their trade territory, despite mixed reviews and the overall impression that it ruined enthusiasm for the older classic pictures. The New Zealand public also faces a housing crisis and mounting homelessness due to opportunistic immigration policies and other serious issues due to earthquake damage. Coughing up incentives for wealthy Hollywood producers is hardly a shared priority."
"grahamsj3","4","2","3","27 February 2014"," A poor endeavor
","Jackson and company took such great pains to remain true to the books in their rendition of The Lord of the Rings, but apparently had no such attachment to The Hobbit. Making The Lord of the Rings (aka the Trilogy) as 3 films was a no-brainer, since it encompasses 3 books in most printed versions. The Hobbit is, in contrast, a single book, yet they're milking the project for every penny by stretching it out (and BORINGLY SO) to 3 films. The first half of this film is a complete snorer! Far, far too long with no action other than a bit of a food fight in Bag End. Next, while the Trilogy had lovable characters in Aragorn, who is noble, yet humble. The 4 hobbits in that film were all well-developed character-wise and thus became popular due to their love of the hero, Frodo, brave but reluctant. In this film, we're supposed to love a batch of dwarfs who are coarse, boisterous, and only after gold. There is nothing noble in their quest at all. Richard Taylor and company did a great job again with the props and the weapons, but I thought the animation, particularly some of the digital work, was below the standard set by the Trilogy. Once the pace picked up, the action picked up as well, with lots of fighting. Unfortunately, I found some of the fights to be too kung-fu movie like. Some of the falls, such as the fall of the bridge in the Goblins lair, would have definitely killed any living thing, yet the dwarfs all hop up and start fighting again without so much as a groan. Too many characters who shouldn't be in The Hobbit appear, I think to stretch the films length and because they were popular in the Trilogy. I was very disappointed in this film. I'm not certain I'll even bother with the next 2, but I probably will since I'm a huge Tolkien fan. But I won't spend any of my money to see it in a theater. I'll wait for the DVDs to come out."

","Very minor spoilers here.<br/><br/>Did have some good bits. The dwarfs' song was great. It should have had many more songs - all the characters sing, just about, in the original. Martin Freeman was excellent as the hobbit. Galadriel was good also.<br/><br/>Wasn't much like the Hobbit in the action sequences. Instead it made me think of Lara Croft Tomb Raider. Lots of death defying stunts - which would indeed kill anyone except invulnerable computer game characters, and those action sequences seem to go on and on for minutes on end.<br/><br/>I ended up skipping through the longer action sequences, e.g. most of the section in the goblin's city. Was just too unlike the Hobbit.<br/><br/>I'm a major Tolkien geek, read just about everything he wrote including most of his son's many compilations of his drafts.<br/><br/>The film just departed too far from the book. Lost the philosophy and a lot of what gave it its sparkle.<br/><br/>I might watch it again, but this time not think of it as the Hobbit but rather as an action adventure film, like Lara Croft. Then it might be more fun to watch.<br/><br/>The thing is I don't think the Hobbit is an action adventure. Is partly a comedy. Also a bit of a fantasy. Also a bit like a musical because of all the songs the characters sing.<br/><br/>Don't know how you would put it into film, but not just pure action adventure anyway.<br/><br/>It might just need a bit of supervision, not sure who from, light supervision e.g. from Christopher Tolkien perhaps, similar role to a science adviser on a science fiction movie. Like the way that J.K. Rowling lightly supervised the Harry Potter movies - not exact copies of the books but preserving the essential characteristics of them.<br/><br/>The sets were great though especially Hobbiton. Rivendel was also quite good, the goblin city not so good in my view just stretched credibility too far to be believable as a goblin city, and the stone giants weren't at all as described in the book where they were much further away, certainly not have the dwarfs walking over them."

","The first part of the long-awaited adaptation of Tolkien's The Hobbit came out in December of last year. It obviously made everyone interested and left different impressions. The whole adaptation's a little weird, since there's three movies planned, based on one book that has barely 300 pages, while one part of Lord of the Rings consists of more than 400 pages. So, no need to say that everything's going to be stretched out more than it has to be. The Hobbit also includes information and additions from other books, but that's not enough to create three movies. Imagine if LOTR had three movie adaptations for each book. Funny, right? Money clearly does its work.<br/><br/>The story in The Hobbit is a prequel to Lord of the Rings. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), the Hobbit, goes on an adventure with thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and the well known wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), to reclaim the dwarfs' gold and homeland which was destroyed by a dragon called Smaug. This is the most simplified version of the plot. The film starts with old Bilbo (Ian Holm) who starts writing the story based on his adventures that started 60 years ago. It's a really nice beginning and intro to the whole background story that needs to be known in order to understand the plot, so I'll give Jackson an A+ for the beginning.<br/><br/>I would also give an A+ to the next scene, which starts with an amazing display of Erebor – the Lonely Mountain and the city of Dale, which lays outside the dwarven kingdom, and which introduces one of the main characters – Thorin Oakenshield. His grandfather, king Thror, rules the Kingdom under the Mountain, which is wealthy and full of gold (who would expect that from dwarfs, eh?). All this gold attracts the dragon, who destroys the kingdom and claims the gold for himself. The film continues with one more scene with old Bilbo, who's remembering how it all started. Gandalf visited him asking if he's interested in going on an adventure, which Bilbo automatically declined. However, his response did not discourage Gandalf from his intentions, so he left a mark on his door which the dwarfs would later notice. The next half an hour is spent introducing us to the dwarfs who are coming to Bilbo's dinner party that Gandalf set up. In this part of the movie, some of the scenes and dwarf portrayals are a little goofy, but appealing. They show two sides of the dwarfs – the 'party' and the 'serious' side. At first, they leave a funny impression with all the eating and drinking, but when Thorin kicks in they're all up for some serious s**t.<br/><br/>The book readers will notice one constant phrase that kept getting on my nerves – 'reclaiming the homeland'. The f**k? Of course that their mission involves 'reclaiming the homeland', but if the gold wasn't in their homeland I'm sure as hell they wouldn't care about it, since dwarfs are all about gold. I get that reclaiming homeland sounds more epic than reclaiming gold, but it keeps being presented as their main goal. As they start their journey, they meet Radagast (Sylvester McCoy), one of the five Wizards of Middle-earth (who was not in the book, but at the time The Hobbit novel is set was in the same areas as Bilbo and the dwarfs), who introduces Dol Guldur and the threat that lays in the abandoned fortress – The Necromancer. This is useful for understanding the complete story, even though the novel The Hobbit does not involve too many facts about Dol Guldur. This plot line about Dol Guldur will come later in play, possibly in the third Hobbit movie, when Jackson's planning to give more details about Gandalf's undeveloped disappearance in the novel. From this perspective, this introduction to Dol Guldur worked out great.<br/><br/>There's one more thing that considerably differentiates the movie from the book and that's – drum roll – Azog (Manu Bennett). He is not present in the book, but here he plays a major antagonist role. Furthermore, the big problem is that he died in the battle of Azanulbizar (although he wasn't killed by Thorin) and yet, I repeat, he's the main antagonist in the movie, if we exclude Smaug (should I even call Smaug an antagonist?). There was a lot of material in Tolkien's work that could've been used instead of Azog that wouldn't have been so contradictory to the book. On the other hand, I understand that such a movie has got to have an antagonist, especially since Smaug's main part comes in the third movie (I guess).<br/><br/>On a positive side, there are a lot of epic scenes in the movie, including Trolls, Rivendell, the Goblin king and Stone giants, and of course the amazing New Zealand landscapes. On a negative side, you can't really get attached to all the characters, since there's too many of them, and they all follow the same storyline so nobody in particular stands out – excluding Bilbo, Thorin, and maybe Balin. In conclusion, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a pretty good movie and I'm really looking forward to the two sequels. I guess Peter Jackson has many reasons for all the things that he included in the movie and that differ from the book, both the minor and major ones and I hope they'll fit in the whole trilogy.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

"l-viking-11","10","8","21","14 December 2012"," Great movie! Ignore the negative reviews!
","I have seen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and it is a great movie! The Hobbit is not as good as The Lord of the Rings movies, but that doesn't mean The Hobbit is a bad movie in any way. The movie has astounding music, beautiful locations, incredible make-up, amazing weapons, huge sets and brilliants actors. The movie was not 'boring' but was filled with action, story and humor. <br/><br/>The movie felt a little more 'fake' than The Lord of the Rings though. I tried to figure out what it was. Was it to much CGI? Did the CGI not look real enough? This first Hobbit movie is full of Trolls, Big Animals, Wargs, Giants, Goblins and Eagles. There is no way to avoid using a lot of CGI. But the CGI DID look good. Then what was it? What made the CGI feel more fake was all the talking creatures. The movie felt more like the book in having some more childish parts to it, such as singing goblins and talking trolls. That being said some negative reviewers exaggerated when talking about this. They said that ALL of the goblins where ENTIRELY CGI which is not true at all. Most of them where actors in suits with CGI faces, and some did not even use CGI at all! Most of the orcs we see in the movie where also actors in full make-up. <br/><br/>I was glad and a bit shocked that Peter Jackson decided to have so many things in the movie that where just like the book. So the singing dwarfs and talking creatures that where in the book, there in the movie. And I am also glad Peter Jackson didn't go to far in keeping everything exactly just like the book. Having a troll's purse talk just wouldn't work in the movie. So overall I am glad at the balance Peter Jackson made with changes from the book into making The Hobbit a great movie. Ignore the negative reviews! People are being negative because they didn't like the new 48 FPS or they where expecting the movie to be as good as The Lord of the Rings. I gave The Lord of the Rings 10/10. I'm giving The Hobbit 9.5/10. (Since you can't give half a star here on IMDb I'm rounding up.) Good job Peter Jackson, I can't wait for the next movie!"

","This movie is as bad as they come. The special effects are great but the writing is horrendous. Thorin just look like a human. The villains, all they know how to do is die. When the troll are turned to stone watch carefully as one points down at the last minute for absolutely no reason except so he matches the original lotr. The worgs look like cat/dogs hybrids. As terrifying as they are supposed to be they are just chopped down with ease by the tiny dwarves over and over. Too much to write but i would suggest pick up the RankinBass version."

","As the film begins, it is the beautiful shire that comes into view, and finally returns, the starting point of the journey, the carefree shire. The whole story of ""My dear Frodo"" begins with this warm and familiar beginning, and when Old Bilbo tells it, history is doomed to become a legend. Hobbits can always surprise us. Maybe we can't decide our own destiny, but we can decide how we do it in a certain amount of time. Shire is behind us, the world is right in front of us, Bilbo told us that this will be an adventure worth remembering for a lifetime, this will be an immortal epic."

","I love seeing Hobbiton and Rivendell. With plenty of time spent in both locations and a solid representation of the iconic Gollum scene this film has some high points.

","I heard from many people that The Hobbit trilogy is fun, yet not so charming. I have never read the book but from what I heard, it's more light-hearted adventurous likely for kids and older people to enjoy. After watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy, is was curious about how The Hobbit will hold up. Will it be it's own movie with new things we never seen or try to live up with The Lord of the Rings with references?<br/><br/>Awhile ago, I did go on the movie to watch it and...well, seems unwatchable. Too many characters to remember, have CGI that looks like it came out of the 2000's, characters being too invulnerable, no atmosphere tone (atleast for me), and it's just so...boring. It's so boring, I have to go on my phone to entertain myself. After realizing the movie was still going on, I changed it to another movie.<br/><br/>Few days ago, I decided to give it a chance to have a go at it, thinking to myself ""The writing, the visual, and the characters won't entertain me but I hope the action can get a pass for me."" I watched the movie again and the beginning of the prologue was pretty promising. There were some questionable things I have to say about it, but I let it slide. I did enjoyed Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves at the beginning of the scene...then, something felt off where the movie killed my enjoyment. I honestly don't know what it is, but it made me stop watching the movie.<br/><br/>I really want to enjoy this film, I really do, but something keeps throwing me off that makes me want to close my eyes. It's really hard to get through the beginning of the film."

"ShinKyo81","8","1","1","10 November 2018"," I cannot help watching this movie without wondering what the first trilogy could have been.
","And with that statement, I do not want to manage down the original Lord of The Rings trilogy, which most of us agree they are far superior than The Hobbit trilogy. However, the budget difference between both trilogies is mind boggling. The first trilogy had a budget of $300 million overall, all three movies combined. The Hobbit trilogy costed around $800 million dollars to make. This means that almost each Hobbit movie had all the budget of all LOTR movies combined. As I said, mind boggling. I sometimes wonder how the original trilogy would have turned out, with that budget. I any case, ""The Hobbit"" is another example of spending tons of cash does not make a good movie.<br/><br/>Despite this, the Hobbit trilogy is a spectacle to watch, the story drags too much across the three movies and probably one single installment would have made more sense. However, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh managed to complement the original novel with bits and pieces of the LOTR books and the Silmarillion, making the next installment of the cinematic Tolkien Universe.<br/><br/>This movie was panned down by critics. Overall, the trilogy amassed around $3 billion, exactly what the first trilogy did. I think the world is ready for more movies set in the Tolkien world. Do you know there is a TV show coming up, right? I cannot wait."

","When Peter Jackson decided to re-enter Middle Earth, I was skeptical of what he would come up with. I guess that's why it took me six years to watch this film. It's a visually stunning film to say the least, better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This first film in the Hobbit trilogy was great.<br/><br/>A lot of the actors from Lord of the Rings returned, except Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. The sets were much better and the special effects are awesome. Watching the film now, I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for anymore than 3 Oscars; nor won any of those three, especially for visual effects."

","I was very excited to see this after considering The Lord of the Rings a resounding success, one of my favorite series of movies of all time!<br/><br/>But when I found out it was going to be a trilogy of movies, I thought ""Why are they making 3 movies out of a very short introductory book to the Trilogy?""<br/><br/>Why, indeed?<br/><br/>Basically they RUINED it by making it 3 movies. 
The first one is boring, the 2nd one is more boring and the 3rd one I didn't even care to see.<br/><br/>They took a successful idea (being faithful to Tolkien's books!) and turned it on its head and decided to invent all kinds of scenes that never existed, and make a really great short book into a way-overlong trilogy of movies!<br/><br/>DUMB IDEA!<br/><br/>If you are a kid who just likes Hobbit stuff you *might* like this. If you're an adult who loves Tolkien's books, you are almost surely going to dislike it. <br/><br/>My advice: Skip this one and go back and re-watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy again!

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an enjoyable re-entry into Middle Earth. It's fun to see familiar faces and places from the Lord of the Rings movies, and see how these two series tie together. However, while I have watched the LOTR films multiple times, I don't know if I can do the same thing with this one. The starting is exasperatingly slow and the movie is longer than it needs to be, considering how much of the book it covers. The visuals are great, but the story is stretched too thin.

Add in some truly dreadful performances, scenes that are simply stupid, and you have a terrible film."
"kees_cornelisse477","5","1","1","31 July 2015"," Fine movie but I'll tell you why it's way of LOTR
","I'll begin with saying that it's a decent movie, you can see they put in a lot of effort and luckily some of the effort is good.<br/><br/>With that said I'll start with why it's way of LOTR or any good movie.<br/><br/>1. It's too long. WAY too long. The LOTR movies were based off 3 big books, these three 2.5/3 hour movies were based off a small book that was used to set up LOTR. I personally didn't read the book but even I could figure out that all the action sequences of the movie weren't based off of big action sequences in the book.""I actually got bored during a lot of scenes because nothing was happening.<br/><br/>2. The characters are forgettable. We once again have a fellowship, this time called ""company of dwarfs"" and I honestly only remember Thorin (who is the leader), Balin (because I knew the name of LOTR) and Gloin (because he is the father of Gimli). You also have Fili, Kili, Oin, Dwalin, Ori, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur but I never knew all those until I played the game ""LEGO the Hobbit"" (which also is a bad game). I also just noticed that all the names are pretty similar so I guess coming up with names wasn't that hard...<br/><br/>3. Too much use of Deus ex machina (when they get saved/don't die last minute). Every time that there is an action scene, at a certain point a character is about to die, however there is no suspense because you know they can't kill off main characters seeing that there will be 2 other movies. People get into trouble but are saved by some miracle and continue like nothing happened. This means no suspense and no big surprises, just a bunch of dumb action sequences.<br/><br/>4. Too much reference to/use of LOTR things. Of course when you are doing a prequel to LOTR you're gonna have a lot of things that have to to with LOTR but OMG are there a lot. Even the Star Wars prequels didn't have so much and I thought those were better in that way. First of all, when I think of Bilbo finding the ring, I think of the 20 second shot in LOTR, not the 20 minute scene in the Hobbit. The scene was nice because we saw how clever Bilbo was but it's once again stretched to the fullest to fill up time. Also, when I think of the story when Bilbo turned the trolls into stone, I think of the 20 second part he told in LOTR, not the 20 minute scene of the Hobbit (which has horrible CG, but I'll get to that). Then there is a part when the company comes to Rivendell, which could have been shorter of not in Rivendell but they go there to see the same things of LOTR cause it worked there so it'll work again in this movie right? Well, not really.<br/><br/>5. Terrible CG. When LOTR came out it had epic use of computer, so good that you felt everything created was real because it still looks real today. Now we're 10 years later so they should've done even better right? NO, all the computer created characters looked like they were made by a computer, rather than have a real feeling. In the sequence where they come to the underground goblin town, the goblins look bad. Then they come to their king and the Goblinking is one of the worst CG characters I've ever seen. The characters don't act like he's real, they don't make him look real, it's just a bunch of CG used to make money, rather than to make a good movie. Also, as I said before, the trolls in the troll scene look bad, not as bad as the Goblinking but still quite bad.<br/><br/>6. The ending. I hated the fact that they were saved by the eagles and that they didn't bother to fly just a little bit further to the mountain. The first one is a Deus ex machina so that has been written before. The second part is that if the eagles had flown just a little further, a lot of stupid and unnecessary parts of the second and maybe even third movie could've been skipped. Even though I liked the Desolation of Smaug a lot better than this one, it still has some weird parts that could've been skipped.<br/><br/>So it seems like I hated the movie. I don't, I like it for what it is but I just like to point out some stupid things that this movie did wrong.<br/><br/>Also, if you do like the Hobbit then good for you, don't let people like me tell you otherwise but in all honesty, it's not a good movie, just a way to get Peter Jackson and his crew more money."
"jake-law123","6","1","1","13 February 2015"," Doesn't hold a candle to the LOTR trilogy, but decent overall.
","First time I saw this I wasn't the biggest fan, mostly because of my bias towards the LOTR trilogy. Looking at it again, it still has its issues but it's by no means a bad film, it's a definite worthy beginning to this epic trilogy.<br/><br/>The lovable, care free Bilbo Baggins, (Martin Freeman) is enlisted by Gandalf and a group of Dwarfs to go on an unexpected journey to Lonely Mountain to reclaim it from the evil dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>It has similar charm to the Fellowship of the Ring. Martin Freeman is an improvement over Ian Holm as Bilbo, bringing an all new sense that we haven't seen yet. The dwarfs are all fun and charming, but their introduction rather dwells on comedic relief, though as soon as they hum the Lonely Mountain song, it drowns you in its atmosphere. As the journey progresses, you learn more and more about each dwarf and their background, and you're lead by Bilbo the whole time, making you feel for him when he feels left out by the group for being not as brave or not cut out. The effects of the film are not as impressive as the ones in the LOTR, not that the CGI is much better, just that it's used more carefully.<br/><br/>The film does drag on a tad. A lot of scenes painfully go on and on to try and add to the epic tone of the film, but trying to make the innocent little kids book into a major epic doesn't always work. A lot of memorable scenes in this, most notably the Gollum scene, but is covered by dragged scene after dragged scene.<br/><br/>Overall it's the weakest film of either trilogy, but it still gets by with likable and familiar characters, and some decent action scenes. I would watch it to get through and watch the others, but it has some charm to it that makes it stand out overall."
"lonno","6","1","1","23 April 2014"," A Visual Feast, But Changes Jarring to Longtime Readers
","TL;DR version: Looked good, plot changes sucked. Score: Six Wilhelm Screams out of Ten.<br/><br/>*******************************************************************<br/><br/>PLOT SPOILERS ABOUND. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND WANT TO, STOP READING NOW.<br/><br/>*******************************************************************<br/><br/>True to form, Peter Jackson's take on Middle Earth looked beautiful. On the whole, he got a lot right. The correct pronunciation of ""Smaug"" got me excited, and the plate-breaking song made me cry; it was incredible that they kept it in, given that they glossed over all the Old English saga-style poetry in LoTR. The maps taken from Tolkien's originals, the attention to detail with the runes and the different languages, all perfect as usual.<br/><br/>The dwarfs were somewhat overdone and somewhat underdone. If you see the dwarfs in this tale as rock star dwarfs, which really is what Thorin and his family and friends were among regular dwarfs, then I suppose they were all right. I didn't like Balin's beard, though. That's what the Lord of Moria looked like? And why were all their accents different? Scots, North England, Yorkshire... was the Dwarf Diaspora that widespread?<br/><br/>Neil Finn's take on Far over the Misty Mountains, ""Song of the Lonely Mountain"" is spot on -- moody, grim and sonorous. It's reminiscent of the version in the 1977 cartoon version of the Hobbit, but that's to be expected as they both take their atmospheric cues from the book. The name Neil Finn may not be familiar, but if you were in school in the 80s, chances were you heard him singing ""Hey, now, hey now, don't dream it's over..."" on the radio with his band, Crowded House.<br/><br/>Gollum, too, was spot on. Andy Serkis is an acting genius who is already revolutionizing entertainment through his own motion capture business. It's true that what we see of Gollum on the screen is rendered by computers; but every muscle of those haunting eyes, the snarling screwed-up nose, the creeping and capering, is sent to the computers from markers on Andy's face and body. And considering Andy Serkis in motion capture markers, tights and trainers was what Martin Freeman had to look at and emote to as Bilbo, his acting was pretty impressive too.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see Radagast in action, as the book merely mentions him in passing. The Wizards, or Istari, appear to be an earthbound rank of the Valar. The what? Lesser gods. Angels, if you will. Powerful masters of the elements. And, as beings closer to perfection than humans, damned forever by a single choice (Q.E.D.: Saruman). So really, bird poop on Radagast's face? For shame.<br/><br/>Elves: why so serious? In Tolkien, the elves led the dwarfs on their ponies across the river. On foot. Singing and teasing the dwarfs. Gracious and magnanimous hosts. None of this ridiculous racial paranoia and Hollywood macho posturing.<br/><br/>Giants are giant humanoids, not stone monstrosities. The book just says the dwarfs huddled under ledges and were miserable in the rain and damp while giants threw boulders at each other for fun. And then they moved on.<br/><br/>Azog's manhunt... um... dwarfhunt for Thorin rang so many alarms I barely noticed the Wargs were slightly better, more wolfish than hyena this time around. Barry Humphries as the Great Goblin was too good, and by that I mean he took the role from a blinking goiter-ridden morbidly obese savage who sees the Elven swords and yells ""Beater and Biter!!!"" To a tragic diva whose death actually had some, well, weight. Was Dame Edna really that bad? But back to the alarms. Here's a major mistake. In PJ's Middle Earth, goblins are scrawny little gits who live in caves under mountains and can't come out in the sun, while orcs are warriors on steroids who can hunt dwarfs day and night. But pick up any reference guide to Tolkien (a good one is J.E.A. Tyler's The Complete Tolkien Companion), look up ""Goblins"" and it'll probably say ""See Orcs."" Tyler's tome recounts that while Azog's orcs were indeed responsible for the murder of Thror and the desecration of his corpse, Azog himself was killed by another kinsman of Thorin's to avenge Thror... a few years before Thorin and Co. meet Bilbo.<br/><br/>So with Azog dead, how does that final scene really play out? The goblins chase Thorin and Co. from the mountain caves into the woods, where, without a tactical retreat available, they climb up some trees. The goblins make fun of them and build bonfires under the trees; Gandalf leaps out of the tree, intent on taking as many Goblins as he can with him into the afterlife. The eagles happen to be nearby and snatch him, the dwarfs and Bilbo up and whisk them away to safety. Deus ex machina? Tolkien liked it so much he used it again twice after that, without a moth or butterfly go-between. But guess what? These eagles, the Eagles of the North, are sentient. They have names. They can converse with people. In fact they're indebted to Gandalf for healing their leader who was shot by an orc with a poisoned arrow. So it's actually no accident that they're attracted to the commotion of an army of goblins lighting fires under trees, on one of which perches a revered friend whom they're eager to save.<br/><br/>But that's all sentimental rot and we really preferred the Bilbo-Thorin bromance anyway, and we want to see Thorin kill Azog in the big battle in movie 3, not Azog's son Bolg getting killed by some were-bear named Beorn.... Right?<br/><br/>Actually, no."

The Hobbit novel is only about the size of one of the Lord of the Rings parts, so I thought it would be very stretched across three films. This was certainly not the case, it is constant action, with extremely great dialogue with the odd laugh during some scenes. As everyone expected, the middle earth world is vast and extremely beautiful, and captured perfectly by Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>I feel that the trilogy is very well established with this first installment, even my 20 year old sister who would have much preferred being at Twilight, admitted how great the film was.<br/><br/>My final words are to encourage anyone, no matter who you are, to go see this film. 10/10 for me.

Tolkien's works of unparalleled imagination will understand that the movie ""The Hobbit"" offers far more than the book. ""The Hobbit"" was written in 1937 as a children's book. Then, in publishing ""The fellowship of the Ring"" in 1954, he preceded it with a ""Forward"" starting thus: ""This tale grew in telling, until it became a history of the Great War of the RingÂ…"". But that's not all. Published posthumously by his family, compiled from an immense treasure of notes he left behind, were numerous titles providing stupendous depth to Middle Earth, including ""The Silmarillion"" in 1977 which started from the very beginning of mythical creation, long before Middle Earth came into existence. To reiterate, the movie ""The Hobbit"", while based primarily on book at least insofar as the main plot is concerned, is more, much more, with material drawn from this vast treasure.<br/><br/>To those who have watched the LOTR trilogy numerous times (""extended"" DVD collection) over these nine years will be ""coming home"" first and foremost not through visual images, but rather the heart warming signature theme for The Shire (which some have come to regard as the second, a mellow version of New Zealand's national anthem). There is also the Rivendell theme which is at once awe-inspiring and wonder-inspiring, as well as the mysterious, insinuatingly sinister theme accompanying the One Ring.<br/><br/>The story starts with sure footing from Bilbo's quiet life at Bag End being interrupted by the arrival of Gandalf, then the 12 Dwarfs. It moves forward delightfully slowly, except to those whose capacity for enjoyment is all but eroded by hopeless overdoses of Hollywood ram-bang flicks. Once the journey starts, the audiences is all but captivated. After a necessary diversion to Ragagast (a thread soon neatly joint), the movie offers up an immensely entertaining sequences on the well-known encounter with the three cannibal trolls. Attacks by goblins brought the company to Rivendell and a scene that is uniformly praised by critics: the council of those at the pinnacle of power and wisdom). Final set piece at the globins' turf at Misty Mountains provide a final climatic conclusion to this first of the trilogy.<br/><br/>The movie is well cast. I, for one, particularly like Martin Freeman in the titular role, aptly portraying Bilbo as more solid and less airy than Frodo. Interesting to note that in the scene when Bilbo is invisible, wearing The Ring, Freeman can almost pass for Dustin Hoffman who would have been perfect had the movie been made a couple of decades ago. Richard Armitage is absolutely convincing as the regal and fierce Dwarf King Thorin. Sylvester McCoy is also marvellous as Ragagast the Brown with passion and eccentricity in equal measure. A lot of our ""old friends"" have come back, in roles varying from briefly cameo to more substantial. Andy Serkis's Gollum still owns the screen whenever he appears. Cate Blanchett, as Galadriel, still has that enigmatic, bewitching, soul-penetrating smile that you are ready to die for without even as much as a blink. Last but not least, the rest of the Dwarfs are all adorable darlings!"

","Peter Jackson has made what I would say is the one of the closes book adaptions I've ever seen. This movie is based on one of my favorite books and Peter Jackson has brought it to life. I read some of the critic's reviews and I'll have to say is they need go read a book and learn about story telling again. Wow the critics really don't know what they are talking about in any way. My kids loved the movie and so did I. I plan to go see it again. If only every book that has been made into a movie received such love. I do so hope the next 2 parts are done as well as this one. I watched in 2D not sure about the camera's used but it wasn't as bad as I heard. GREAT GREAT GREAT MOVIE!!!!!! Peter Jackson DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE CRITICS follow the books and make movie HISTORY!!!"

","Hi, this is my first review but i must speak out from the appalling reviews i have heard from many sources, and put them to rest.<br/><br/>first of, i am a avid Tolkien fan, and i have watched The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey on 2nd day of its release, and i have to tell you all......it was absolutely amazing! so much fun watching, so easy to get in to as well but i must point out that i watched it in 2D and in 24fps.<br/><br/>from what i have heard from such critics as the ones interviewed on the BBC show ""The Review Show"", those critics have no idea what they are saying regarding the duration of the Hobbit, because it isn't slow moving and the characters don't look like children's cartoon!<br/><br/>Now, onto the actual review:<br/><br/>1: the duration of 169 minutes is not slow at all and is not at all boring!<br/><br/>2: the acting is pretty astonishing, especially from Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Sir Ian Mckellen and the rest of the cast, if any of the cast from the film are reading this..good show :)<br/><br/>3: the story blends in to the novel quite well, apart from a few situations but they aren't significant really.<br/><br/>4: the humour is very funny at times, and isn't cheesy as i would have thought it would<br/><br/>5: the action was awesome! a few over the top scenes with the Dwarfs in the goblin town but they were still awesome :)<br/><br/>now, i have read a few things on IMDb posts regarding some shots not in the film, the Gandalf shots are in the trailer are from the second film i think because that trailer was released when there were only two films being released.. ""POTENTIAL SPOILER"" the shots of Gandalf fighting in Dol Guldur are in the second film because Gandalf was never near Dol Guldur in the first film :)<br/><br/>and one last thing... the whole controversial thing about 48fps is risky, but it could be worth it.. after all it isn't about what the film looks like, its about what the film's like :)<br/><br/>Well done on Sir Peter Jackson, and all of the people involved in this film, and cant wait for the Desolation of Smaug!!"
"titus_larcius","7","7","18","15 December 2012"," Turns Out Jackson Was Right
","I walked into the cinema filled with apprehension and a sense of foreboding. I'd read many of the criticisms of the HFR, and was filled with dread. I had some idea of what to expect, knowing more or less what higher frame rates look like, but was still nervous. Once the movie began, however, it didn't take long for a broad smile to appear on my face. All I could think was, ""Yes!"" I could actually track tracking shots! I could see clearly what was on the screen during a pan; it wasn't a blurred mess that bothered my eyes, like every other movie I'd ever seen! I find it amusing that we've become so accustomed to this that an improvement is looked upon with fear and trepidation, and outright scorn. I suppose progress will always have its nay-sayers. I, for one, applaud Jackson and his courageous decision to innovate in an industry as stodgy as Hollywood. And good for WB for being on board. <br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it was fairly typical Jackson fare. There were some unnecessary and non-sensical additions (e.g. Radagast traveling clear across, or around, or through, the Misty Mountains on his little sledge just to find Gandalf), and some downright, god-awful lighting decisions (also the case in LOTR), such as the night scene of the party sleeping at the ""front porch"" (right before the goblin ambush). Where was all that bright, warm light coming from?! They were in a cave, at night, with no fire. I'll accept almost any reasonable explanation, because I can't think of one. The same lighting existed in Gollum's lake. He was in the deepest roots of the mountain. I don't understand it. I can't be the only person who thinks about these things. And it would have been more atmospheric to have had the correct lighting for that scene anyway. I've seen many films with EXCELLENT dark or night scenes that look realistic and convincing, and still allow enough light to see the actors' expressions. What Jackson was doing I've no idea. <br/><br/>But there was MORE than plenty about which to be happy. All the good more than made up for any of the failings. There was plenty of humour, and the tale was told at a very good pace (neither too rushed, nor too slow), and was very rich. The familiar story drew me right in, and left me looking forward to the next instalment. <br/><br/>All said, I loved it. I next will see it in 24fps to see if I like it as much.<br/><br/>Well, I just saw the movie in 24fps, 2D. Having seen the film in both frame rates I can conclude only that each mode has its pros and cons. For me, the greatest pro of the HFR was the absence of motion blur. Seeing it in 24fps reminded me of how annoying that is, especially in a movie like this, where the camera pretty much never sits still. But apart from that, I think I like, on the whole, the 'feel' of the 24fps better. All I can really say is that it 'felt' better, more cinematic; I felt like I was watching a movie, and that made me happy. With the HFR, I felt like I was watching... something else, NOT a movie. With the 24fps, I was more invested, more immersed and engaged in the story. The HFR was clearer, yes, which is great in its own right, but at the end of the day, the 24fps struck more of a chord with me; it sat better with me, somehow. I wish a could present a better reason, but it's something on an intangible, almost emotional level, which I can't really explain. <br/><br/>As for the movie, having seen it now 3 times, the annoying parts REALLY annoy me now, although the 2D version seemed darker, so the bad lighting wasn't as glaring (pun intended). But, on the whole, I felt compelled to change my rating from an 8 to a 7, now that my initial excitement and love of the HFR has worn off."
"caan003","9","7","18","13 December 2012"," Cool and fun
","I really don't understand all the hate from critics vs the 48fps! It was 3d without eyestrain! And the movie was definitely not too long for me. Peter is doing these movies as one big movie, as he did with lotr, so it's really hard to just rate the first when you haven't seen the other two. I give it 9/10 but it is very possible the rating will rise if the upcoming movies goes good with this one! I think this movie is very comparable with the first Lord of the rings movie, not very much by itself but (probably) great in the whole picture. The tone is of course a bit lighter in this movie.<br/><br/>Wonderful movie with the gollum scenes as probably the best scenes in any movie this year. And absolutely worth seeing it in HFR 3D<br/><br/>Keep em coming Peter!"
"ionut-nicolaie","6","9","25","20 December 2012"," Peter Jackson needs to find another cash cow
","I've seen this movie yesterday. It was boring. The fight scenes were somehow nice, but that was expected. It was the first time in long period when I saw people leaving before the end.<br/><br/>There were some very poor attempts for humor, but no one laughed. A lot of cheesiness. The dinner scene takes about a quarter of the movie. They sing, they dance, they tell stories, make bad or good jokes. But you cannot loose the feeling of filler. A lot of filler.<br/><br/>There is a big chance that all these sub mediocre, long, three movie, might have been one brilliant long movie, if not for the ambition and greed of one director. Maybe the next two will be better, but I wouldn't hold my breadth."
"petercms","5","6","15","5 December 2013"," Disappointing
","Watched it last night again, for the first time since it came out and came to the same conclusions: way way way too long and there is way too much CGI, to the extent it distracts from the story.<br/><br/>And as much as I adore the (extended versions of) LOTR movies and what was built from the books, I have to say with great regret that Peter Jackson completely missed the point here: It's a children's story about how a small Hobbit survives all kinds of adventures through his wit and cunning. It's not a story about all kinds of LOTR style battles (apart from the ending of the story, the battle of the 5 armies). They feel completely out of place here.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are many many useless and drawn out scenes: Rivendel comes to mind, and many more.<br/><br/>I am sad to see this drawn out movie be only the prelude to another 2 of the same length.<br/><br/>It could have been so much more powerful in shorter version: right now I feeling the pace is lost time and time again.<br/><br/>Still a 5 out of 10 for effort, but I agree with many of the 1 star reviews!"

","I have seen the Hobbit three times now and each time I find something new and my delight in the movie continues to grow. Contrary to what others might say I did not notice the time passing at all- the movie did not seem overly long and I felt as if I had walked out of a movie that was 1 1/2 hours rather than 3. Yes there are scenes that seem unrealistic and yes, the battle sequences in Goblin City are a bit far-fetched but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of watching them. I loved the music, the scenery, and the characters in this film, and would gladly watch the film again and again. <br/><br/>I am looking forward to Desolation of Smaug in 2013 and There and Back Again in 2014"
"chrisblackgb","9","6","15","31 December 2012"," A journey to remember...
","What a journey it has been It is a great film no doubt, took me back to my early days when I first watched Lord of the Rings with my father though he was not here with me today sadly. This film has got to be judged on multiple levels, but overall it produces quite unique and very much unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>Let my start from the not so great things, 3D as everybody would expect by now, was atrocious and does not add anything to the picture itself, well maybe except one scene when butterfly flies away and gets almost in your way; that was very pleasant and would not be possible without 3D. Despite that, it is just a gimmick and not worth the money. <br/><br/>Secondly, the plot is not the greatest achievement of mankind, definitely not due to Peter Jackson's fault. I have read The Hobbit long time ago yet it felt like it follows the main plot well enough, it is just that J.R.R. Tolkien – despite being a master of his craft – did not put the most cohesive and believable story together for The Hobbit. Still it very enjoyable but for me it lacks all the dark and gloomy bits that are so well presented in The Game of Thrones for instance, they just add to the story and make it all feel almost real. Well, The Hobbit is not real, no matter how you cut it. If any fantasy can be or at least feel real that is I have seen it done better. Perhaps it is due to the fact that I am so over high fantasy and I am leaning towards dark one, and have been doing so ever since I started playing WarHammer. Though, it has got to be said that for a high fantasy story, The Hobbit is the best there is.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I cannot stress that enough how HFR (High Frame Rate) adds value to the movie. It looks so much nicer and changes the way we see it. I sincerely hope; despite many negative reviews from the ever so highly self-proclaimed film critics, it will become a new standard in the cinemas as it is definitely the way to go. I have been using similar, though artificial way of enhancing the frame rate of films at home, and I love it! What is more, one can only wonder how beautiful New Zealand must be; as yet again the landscape scenes are truly remarkable. The quality of the picture presented, is also the best I have even witnessed. It looks vivid, lively, and most importantly –believable; something you fairly rarely can see in the cinema lately. With that respect, it is a true masterpiece and has got no equals.<br/><br/>The cast has done a great job and pretty much everybody delivered what was expected of them. Saruman is cold and pretends to be stupid. Gandalf is wise and witty. Bilbo is afraid of his own shadow yet turns out to be the brave one. In a nutshell, they succeeded. The only letdown is the company of Dwarfs, each and every one of them did very well yet it is difficult to have any attachment to either of them. Not enough character development as we do not get to know them well enough to simply care about them. Again, I believe it is not due to Jackson's fault; as if recall correctly, in the book you do not really get enough information about all of them either. However, I am pretty sure that you get a bit more than it the film. This comes as a surprise to me, considering that it is just one book and it will be dragged out to be a trilogy. They definitely could have spent a bit more time to tell us who the Dwarfs are as individuals. By the time we get to see them for the first time, we are well acquainted with what they are fighting for but it is not enough in my opinion. They are just not unique enough for the audience to actually care if one of them gets hurt or not; which was not the case in the book whatsoever. <br/><br/>All in all, though it might not read like that; I actually liked the film very much. Yet again it has dwarfed every other film this year, very much like Lord of the Rings did in its time. It certainly takes you on an adventure that will continue on for years to come. It gives us much easier to understand story than Tolkien's most famous book, yet it is compelling enough to leave the audience hunger for more. It is only a third of the story, and yet it is concise and could probably be an individual one and still be a satisfactory experience. Well done to everyone who made this, for the lack of better word - experience - possible."
"supernatural136-112-438827","10","6","15","30 December 2012"," Amazing Movie!
","Okay, so I'm probably going out on a limb here, but lets just pray some giant eagles will catch me if I fall. <br/><br/>Anyways, I fell in love with this movie from the first scene, which is not near as pointless as people have you believe. It really kicks off the LOTR series, making you want to yell ""No, Frodo, don't go wait for Gandalf!"". And it gives you a good look at an older, wiser Bilbo before you get to see his young, really stick-in-the-mud self. While we're here, let me fangirl for a second. I love, love, love Martin Freeman. And was so ever excited when I found out BBC's own John Watson was Bilbo Baggins. He embodies the character perfectly, even when the scene isn't focusing on him, he's off in the corner being perfect. Back to business. The movie, I'll admit as a long time Tolkien fan and reader of all his books, has embellishments and changes. Like the orcs following the gang around, being all evil and dramatic. And the White Orc hunting for Thorin. Not to mention the ponies getting themselves captured by trolls. <br/><br/>We'll start there. In the book, as you probably know, Bilbo is just going to see what the light is for the dwarfs, decides to be an idiot and practice his pick-pocketing skills on trolls fifteen times his size. He then gets himself captured. I thought the way it happened in the movie flowed much better, and made much more sense to me. The White Orc was a little stupid. I think Jackson really just threw him in to add more to the movie, which only encompasses eighty or so pages of the two-hundred pages of the book. It's not a long or complicated tale really, but a little dramatization never hurt anyone.<br/><br/>The pros of this movie are as follows:<br/><br/>–amazing cast<br/><br/>–awesome battle scenes<br/><br/>–truly excellent portrayal of the riddle scene, it sends chills up your spine and makes you tingle with geeky excitement at the same time (I had to remind myself a million times after he picked up the ring that Bilbos story ends well) <br/><br/>–breathtaking graphics<br/><br/>–the music, it's really really beautiful<br/><br/>–good jokes, funny moments scattered throughout<br/><br/>–Ian Mckellen<br/><br/>–(again) Martin Freeman<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>–Bilbo's sudden amazing swordsmanship near the end when he's never handled a sword before<br/><br/>–random Radagast scene<br/><br/>–quick ending that'll leave you going ""come on! They just got going!"" <br/><br/>So, in summation. I loved the Hobbit enough to give it a 10/10 and didn't see enough wrong with it to rate it badly in any way. Do not listen to the bad reviews, they're a bunch of Tolkien fan boys who hate changes or not true fans at all. The Hobbit fits in perfectly with the LOTR world and is a classic reluctant hero story that has you rooting for the Hobbit from day one. I loved it in every way, and was stuck in Middle Earth for hours after seeing it. Can't wait for the next one."
"AthenaStardear","8","6","15","27 December 2012"," HFR advantage compared
","Having seen both the 3D and HFR-3D versions of the Hobbit, I can tell you that the HFR is much more fun.<br/><br/>Compared to HFR, the non-HFR 3D Hobbit is like most 3D movies. At times during the non-HFR Hobbit, the 3D is more noticeable than others. The effect is more like a gimmick which wore out for me as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>As with a few other non-HFR 3D flicks, I got a headache about half way through. I closed one eye for a few minutes and it went away.<br/><br/>HFR on the other hand is like watching real people in real places. The depth starts in front of the screen. Every kind of motion is lifelike. Details in the image are sustained during motion. Objects tossed about are smooth, water flowing is like watching a natural waterfall in nature. The camera moves like your eyes would, and the panning of scenes is beyond breathtaking. The realism continues through the whole movie, and there are no gimmicks in the ending credits to remind you it was 3D.<br/><br/>In non-HFR, there are occasional things that jump out of the screen, and you feel you could touch them for a moment. In the Hobbit HFR, characters were standing right next to me to the point where I really thought someone had sat in the seat next to me for a moment, though it was in the movie.<br/><br/>There was no headache at all. I could watch HFR all day and love it.<br/><br/>With this realism, character development was stronger, and the soundtrack seemed a notch better, though I didn't see the HFR at an ""XD"" theater (not this first time anyway).<br/><br/>Though I have a great 3D home system, this HFR is not happening at home theaters any time soon, and will surely be missed. I will see The Hobbit in HFR again at the theater, which is a rare event for me these days.<br/><br/>8/10 since for the story and 10/10 for the introduction of HFR 3D. How did we put up with 24fps for so long?"
"jostrow1502","7","6","15","24 December 2012"," In my opinion not that great of a movie.
","I just came back from the movie and I felt a strong urge to write a review on it. I have never written a review before on anything, so I registered to IMDb and just started writing this.<br/><br/>This movie will be forgotten very quickly I think. Yes it has the epic effects, yes the scenery is amazing, but like Avatar, the plot is greatly lacking. I found myself saying to myself often ""who cares?"" throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I am not a LOTR fanboy, far from it. I do think they were great movies, but I haven't seen them again since they came out, so my review isn't coming from a fanboy POV. <br/><br/>The chain of events in the movie is quite ludicrous. More then not it was quite clear to me that the plot was made up just to give an excuse to have huge CGI spectacles. I read the book a long time ago but I am certain a lot of the plot is made up since half of what happens I have no memory of ever taking place in the book. Granted, it's downright visually stunning at times and I was like I WANT TO GO THERE! Whenever I saw the beautiful lush landscapes LOTR is known for. But how many times can you be shown beautiful scenes before you get bored of them, and waiting for that something to happen. <br/><br/>That brings me to another point. Most of the time I was sitting in the theater, I felt as though I was waiting for it to begin. Just waiting for things to start rolling, for the adventure to begin, and I left the theater quite underwhelmed, with that feeling never being satisfied.<br/><br/>Especially when the ending came (which I will not spoil for you), one thing was clear to me. The main goal of this movie was to make money. It's not hard to throw boatloads of money and make epic CGI sequences (much like the movie 2012, which this movie reminds me of in more then one way, for example the many ""nail biting"" scenes where they are saved by a hair, cliché scenes where they are hanging by one hand, etc) It is a lot of show and very little soul. Yes it's a fun movie to go through albeit can be boring a lot of the time, it is still a good time, there are some good laughs to be had as well, but falls short of the original trilogy by a mile. <br/><br/>In summery, with more show then soul, The Hobbit falls short of being a memorable film.<br/><br/>(if you found this review helpful please tell me, I really want to know if people like my review or not. Also feel free to comment to me!! :)"

","I had been in withdrawal since LOTR ended so many years back. I do miss the characters and the settings it transported some of us into.<br/><br/>This time round, the story is that of one that should be more cheerful and it did accomplished that without being what the original book's intended target audience was, children. And quite fairly, I would have walked out at the first hint of this being made for children only.<br/><br/>I shall not comment on the story in case it spoils it for everyone.<br/><br/>In my opinion, as I've watched the high frame rate 3D version, it should have been done in higher frame rate at all. It made it looked like a very good HD cam movie made for TV.<br/><br/>The effects, though are better, should not have been more realistic in the rendering of the backgrounds.

I found it fantastic and very well made. The whole scene with Gollum was very true to book and well done. Music was amazing. Anyone who goes to see the movie knows what they are going to expect, who hasn't read the hobbit as a child, so the story was not going to be new. But they did exceed my expectations with the movie. Storyline was well done and very very detailed, which is important if you are a Tolkien fan.

","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a failure of epic proportions. If you see it in HFR 3D, that is. And after having spent almost $20 to see it and hate it, I am certainly not going to pay to sit through all two hours and fifty minutes in a different format as the film itself didn't impress me enough to even consider doing that right now. So, I guess it will have to wait.<br/><br/>So, with that, after months of anticipation, the film was ruined.<br/><br/>Watching this film in HFR was like watching a high-budget PBS television version of the movie, rendering everything to look second rate and really quite ridiculous, including special effects which look like they were lifted from a video game...or a student film. It was like it was made to look like a movie which would only appeal to five-year olds.<br/><br/>Mr. Jackson, what were you thinking? Within minutes of the film starting, I couldn't believe it was filmed in such a horrible format which should be saved for sitcoms. The film was immediately rendered a joke. And I still had one hundred and sixty-five minutes to sit through. When I bought my tickets to the film six weeks ago, there was no mention of different formats besides being in 3D. I would never have chosen to watch this film in HFR if I had known in advance. And quite frankly, I think Jackson or the cineplex should give me my money back.<br/><br/>So, it's tough to write a proper review of the film because every detail, every word, every effect came across as simply childlike and horribly mediocre simply due to the format. The film seemed to drag on forever and I just couldn't wait for it to end.<br/><br/>So, the only advice I can tell you? See it on 3D IMAX....and let me know how it is.

They just blame the weather on the giants... no fighting involved.<br/><br/>*The brown wizard scenes and the whole Necromancer story was made up. Again, just barely mentioned in the book, but not part of the story. <br/><br/>*Why would the brown wizard run past the dwarfs with the Wargs and Orc following him if he was trying to let them get away? <br/><br/>*Thorin, not Gandalf, kills the Orc king right away. Bilbo was also captured. <br/><br/>*Bilbo finds the ring, quite accidentally, in the dark tunnel. He doesn't see Gollum drop it. And seriously, the ring... it's the one thing they shouldn't mess up! <br/><br/>*The meeting at Rivendale is supposed to be happy and fun. The elves give the dwarfs horses and supervisions for their journey. The dwarfs feast and stay there for 2 weeks. <br/><br/>*The other elf queen and the white wizard are not supposed to be in Rivendale. They aren't in the Hobbit story. <br/><br/>*Gandalf leaves Rivendale with the dwarfs. <br/><br/>*Just the wargs were meeting by chance at the trees. The wargs surround the trees and just Gandalf throws lighted pine cones. Bilbo shouldn't have been able to climb a tree on his own. He's too short. Again, the mystery white orc that had a stint with Thorin was not chasing him. In fact, he shouldn't even exist. The eagles come and save them because they don't like orc and wargs. - The trees don't fall over, but the dwarfs do get nearly smoked out.<br/><br/>GOOD PARTS: *The beginning as the dwarfs came in was pretty accurate, though too long of a scene. *Riddles with Gollum. They did a good job with this. <br/><br/>The screen writers failed. Peter Jackson is still amazing, but there was too much action and they made up too many things that are not contributed to Tolkien's work."
"jatzel09","7","9","26","13 December 2012"," A Trilogy's Average Beginning
","There are films that define a decade. Works of the seventh art that one must view in the future to better understand culture, taste and trends of a particular time period. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is an example of this. Having made close to three billion dollars all together, these are films that greatly influenced culture in the 2000s to the point that the fantasy genre was no longer one overwhelmingly followed by book worms but now one of high mainstream appeal. Even the Academy of Infinite Wisdom could not deny the last entry a much deserved Oscar in the year 2003.<br/><br/>We are now in the 2010's and exactly 11 years after The Fellowship of the Ring first hit theaters, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is released. Most fans know of the long and tedious pre-production process that went on before this came to be and it is not relevant now how Peter Jackson ended up being the Director and not Guillermo del Toro. What is relevant is how this entry does little to capture audience's imagination. <br/><br/>What was originally going to be two-parts has ended up being three, basically three hour movies which is extremely excessive for a 300 page book that is just an introduction to the masterpiece that is Lord of the Rings. Mr. Jackson himself has said that this was done so that the characters could be developed more deeply. Something which one does not see in this film. The reasons for Thorin's Quest are obvious and there is no depth. <br/><br/>This does not make it a bad movie, it is still entertaining. Great costumes, a familiar score, the return of beloved characters, wonderful panoramas as always. But we are left scratching our heads regarding if three epics were necessary. After asking this question, the most resounding answer is no. <br/><br/>While all three LOTR films have their own magic and could easily stand alone, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is nothing more than a glorified introduction. I sure hope that by next November, things are different."
"dbeall","10","9","26","11 December 2012"," A response to some of the Critics of the Hobbit
","I have not yet seen the film, which actually gives me more freedom to discuss some aspects.<br/><br/>First point is that overall the Critical response is not as bad as many are making out and that much of the criticism that has been made should be taken with a grain of salt. Many have complained about the 48fps – but really this should be ignored. 90% of viewers will see it at 24fps and this is the way critics should see it as this is the more apples to apples comparison with LOTR and all other movies. Any criticism of 48fps should be a foot note and not part of the conclusion. I have a TV that allows me to switch off the Soap opera effect – thus I can not complain if I choose the wrong format for me. Audiences will have the same choice.<br/><br/>Some people complain that since the Hobbit is 400 pages this does not merit an epic style trilogy. But this drives me nuts – since this trilogy is not simply the Hobbit. One reason why I am more excited to see the movie is because I will not be familiar with the numerous non Hobbit characters and plot elements – all of which are potentially justifiable as they come from Tolkiens writings or notes or probable intentions. Plus I hear that the goal of seeking out Smaug has evolved to include the more epic/bridging motive to prevent Smaug becoming allied with Sauron. So critics who go on about six Chapters of the Hobbit, well they are showing a significant lack of professionalism and ignorance on the subject.<br/><br/>Then there are those who appear to forget that this is a very difficult set up movie – simply having a single movie with a couple of Dwarfs meeting untimely deaths would carry little emotional weight, and be totally at odds with LOTR. It is clearly imperative that Jackson some how creates character development for each of the Dwarfs – so if the first hour is rather slow – the pay off theoretically should come in spades later on in the tale. We do not yet know if this will be a great Trilogy – but for it to have any chance of being a great Trilogy we must get to know the Dwarfs, they each need screen time and they each need events that show off their individual characteristics. Many of my favorite movies have slow or even irritating first halves- but that just makes the climax so much more thrilling, more worth waiting for. A good Critic should not have a short attention span – certainly not shorter that the millions of teenagers that will adore this movie.<br/><br/>Finally there seems to be lack of understanding about how difficult it must be to balance the Hobbit (basically a Children's book) with the more adult LOTR. But it seems that Jackson is successfully making that Transition. This means that the film with have more humorous and less fearsome action scenes – but I suspect that that will evolve over the course of the Trilogy. Many of the smarter critics are giving Jackson the appropriate latitude to achieve all of this over the course of the trilogy. <br/><br/>Is the film 20 minutes too long? Well I have yet to see it."
"chickie-mcfluff2","10","5","12","12 January 2013"," An Expected Masterpiece
","Expectations were high as I sat through the many advertisements to finally see the movie was about to start. Despite the many reviews that took made it out to sound that Jackson had lost his touch, I refused to believe that they were true and went to see for myself. And I am very glad that I did.<br/><br/>There were high expectations for this movie after the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It was believed that after so many years that Peter Jackson may have lost his touch in the cinematic masterpiece department, but it seemed that in the end he pulled through.<br/><br/>The story starts with a young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman - Sherlock TV series) outside of his hole in the ground when he receives an unexpected visit from the famous wizard Gandalf The Grey (Ian Mckellen - Lord of the Rings Trilogy) who is offering him an opportunity to share in an adventure.<br/><br/>From this point the movie kicks off, and Bilbo gains his very first meeting with the dwarfs who offer him the chance to assist them in taking back their kingdom, Erebor. Along their travels they must face many dangerous foes such as trolls, goblins and, most of all, the dreaded Pale Orc who has a history with the leader of the dwarfs, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage).<br/><br/>With wonderful CGI and special effects, Jackson brings Tolkien's tale of wonder to life, with serious fighting and a whole lot of comedic expression and outstanding acting, this movie was nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece."

But yesterday I watched it in 3D HFR and I think it was amazing! I should have watched it in that format on the first day and not went for just 3D.

"joben-525-633946","8","5","12","3 January 2013"," Small in size, big in achievement.
","'The Hobbit' is a novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien, consisting of less than 300 pages - significantly smaller in size than the three Lord of the Rings books. <br/><br/>So when Peter Jackson decided to anchor the adaption of the book in three two hour plus parts, I was left a little speechless. Avergaing around 99 pases per film, fans would be forgiven for fearing that scenes would feel too stretched and overcooked. Thankfully though this doesn't affect the film too much.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson is an avid fan of making his films attractive due to the background colours and landscapes entailed in his productions. Like, 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy and 'The Lovely Bones', this is certainly full of colour and like Jackson's predecessor's visually stunning. From the evergreen countrysides, to the enormous forests, to the underground lake, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' has some fabulous background settings and environments.<br/><br/>One of the main positives however is leading actor Martin Freeman. Freeman is Bilbo Baggins (60 years before 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), a quiet hobbit who lives by himself in the shire, preparing to leave his comfort zone for a journey of war and anguish. His calm and careful approach to matters is rather humorous yet relatable to for many a person and he is able to recapture the feel Elijah Wood did as Frodo in the original trilogy. <br/><br/>Back up cast is also excellent with Richard Armitage and the great Ian McKellen the pick of a fine set of actors. Armitage portrays Thorin, a type of person who will not think before his actions but will be willing to fight for a cause while McKellen's Gandalf is a much more assured character, with the ability to make up for Thorin's mistakes.<br/><br/>Also, Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis) makes a cameo appearance towards the latter end of the movie. This freshens up the film due to his psychopathic humour and insanity whilst making connections to 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy set 60 years later.<br/><br/>The downsides are that the scenes do feel a little prolonged and appear to have been stretched to the maximum. Had there been several adjustments, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' could have probably lasted at least an hour less with by just sticking to the basic source material.<br/><br/>Overall however, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is truly an epic, even if it's inferior to its predecessors."
"pjthefey","5","5","12","30 December 2012"," We Got Jar-Jar Binxed in Theaters
","I had high hopes for this movie after enjoying the Lord of the Ring, but The Hobbit proved to be a tremendous disappointment after its predecessor set the bar so high. The main problem is that the film seems to have been made for children. Large amounts of screen time in this extremely long movie seem to be devoted to nonsensical characters such as the Brown Wizard that are playful and childlike, but don't do a whole lot to advance the plot. I have read the book, and was extremely disappointed to see the light in which some of the characters were portrayed. <br/><br/>I also felt extremely cheated out of an ending. Unlike the Lord of the Rings movies which correlated with each novel, The Hobbit only tells half the story. I'm not sure I will bother to watch the sequel. The directors and screen writers would have been better suited to cut about an hour of the little kids stuff and finish the whole story. Granted, I'm sure this decision was made so that they could sell another movie in a year or two but unfortunately the means by which they stretched out the screen-time may have alienated a chunk of the audience in the way that the first Star Wars prequel did with the character Jar Jar Binx.<br/><br/>If you have kids, then by all means take them. If you are a hardcore high fantasy viewer... maybe go see it in the theater. If you are an average high fantasy fan, save this one for DVD."
"webservices-worms","6","5","12","28 December 2012"," Might have been an excellent film
","... if only it had not tried to blow a wonderful, short and sweet children's book up into an LOTR-style epic. While the commercial rationale for this explosion seems unfortunately clear enough, what was an adequate formula for Tolkien's epic of epics, which at the source is already a massive and dense trilogy, just doesn't cut it for the Hobbit. Indeed, it speaks for Jackson's undoubted genius that in spite of this formula for unmitigated disaster he still produced a film somewhat worth seeing. <br/><br/>Some scenes such as the initial visit of the dwarfs are great, not to speak of the encounter with Gollum. All the makings of a great film are there. A true pity that Jackson did not opt to go for that one great film instead of three mediocre ones..."

","When I heard they were going to make 3 movies with this little book: ""The Hobbit"", which I read awhile back, I immediately thought corporate greed, that they should be ashamed and it was going to ruin the franchise. Furthermore, I was also concerned about hearing that Peter Jackson was going to take liberties with his version of this great Tolkien classic . <br/><br/>But after watching ""The Hobbit"", I would like to apologies for my assumptions that I made. Indeed, Mr. Jackson's attention to detail justifiably needs 3 movies...and he made a great classic even more epic, but yet, still remained true to Tolkien's vision. <br/><br/>Was this movie really almost 3 hours long? Seriously, I lost track of time, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, I was that mesmerized. Visually, scene after scene, one word sums it up: beautiful. The acting: superb. The sounds/music: powerful, full of emotion.<br/><br/>This movie is so good that I am going to do something I never do, pay to watch it again at the theaters.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see."

This didn't bother me to much.I really hope the next parts will at least be as good as this one. I loved it and I can't wait for it to be available on Blu-ray.

"misterkevinoh","6","7","19","14 December 2012"," The Movie Event Of The Year
","This movie is an experience you do NOT want to miss out on. Cast aside all your worries about 48 FPS because what Peter Jackson has done is truly revolutionary in terms of visual media... IF you're willing to accept what you're going to see. It's undeniable, the movie initially looks like a bad fantasy soap opera when you first start watching, and it's at that initial moment you have to decide whether or not you're going to accept this new frame-rate or not. I highly advise you commit to immersing yourself in it, because if you do, you will experience a film like no other. The realism of it all really kicks in and turns the dial for visuals up by 9000. There will be moments in this movie where they capture such scope and beauty that it will leave your jaw on the flipping ground. The only problem with this new frame-rate is that it hasn't been perfected yet. Some props look terribly cheap, some sets do not have the effect they should, and sometimes make does look poor in such a clean image. But these are such minor complaints against such a grand movie it's almost a disservice to yourself if you skip out on the 48 FPS just because it's not without fault. <br/><br/>Now whether the movie was good or not? Yes, it was pretty good. It's a much funner movie then the Lord Of The Rings, and it doesn't have as serious a story. You won't feel too emotionally attached to some of the characters, but with all good trilogies, it's all to build up to something bigger and better than ever before. <br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey gets a 7/10 in my book. This is the cinematic experience of the year... do NOT miss out on it."
"alex-rj-hermes","8","4","9","27 January 2013"," A visual delight!
","Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, orcs and hobbits, dwarfs, elves and trolls of all ages. We are going back to where it all began and like the Star Wars trilogy it's time for the age of the prequels but fear not dear reader, the first installment has certainly proved a great successor to the Lord of the Rings with only a mere few actors returning to the plot from the now decade old series.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An unexpected journey grossed $180,000,000 USD in it's opening weekend globally and for a very deserving reason. Firstly this film just looks incredible being generally disappointed and slightly motion sick every time I see a movie in 3D I opted bravely for the 2D selection and can safely say it was still a visual delight from the colour of the grass and trees of the wild middle earth forests to the incredible intricate multi layers of detail and mind blowing CG effects which surely kept many animators and compositors up many a sleepless night and these efforts have certainly paid off. This is a movie experience in every sense.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Bilbo Baggins from Bagg End in the Shire is the unlikely hero played by Martin Freeman at first could not seem more unlikely as the British office star is funny just to look at but believe me you can take him seriously too in the final scenes he will break your heart and moments later you'll be bursting with laughter causing you to almost wet yourself from his comic timing and general mannerisms. Sir Ian McKellan as a younger Gandalf is as strong and endearing as his previous efforts and it brings a level of comfort to see possibly more of him on screen in this trilogy. The leader of the Dwarfs aptly named Thorin Oakenshield is a fantastic British actor named Richard Armitage who I had not had the pleasure of watching before playing roles in Captain America and even UK cult series The Vicar of Dibley is certainly a presence in his own right in this role. Also for lovers of Flight of the Conchords comedy series keep an eye out for a band member in this film, great to see New Zealand natives receiving roles in this saga.<br/><br/>The music score is mesmerizing and draws you right into the story encapsulating all that is immense and so well written world that is middle earth and its races.<br/><br/>The only shortcomings this film may suffer from is of course the plot itself. Stretching the authors novel into 3 long feature films has been made possible of course by Jackson's ability to embellish the story and even create new characters such as The Brown wizard to fill the depth of these productions however if you didn't read the Hobbit you would have probably never guessed aside from this character just maybe not having a Tolkien vibe on accounts of his slight corniness. In addition to this they were not as many epic battle that being said the action sequences were engrossing and highly entertaining with a small role played by an Australian actor who is always an impressive voice talent, I ask all Aussie viewers to see if you can guess who plays the troll King.<br/><br/>Overall The Hobbit: An unexpected journey is sure to please almost all. Except for maybe romance buffs as there was no real theme of romantic love, go see it in the movies its one that needs to be experienced in the cinemas. I might go see it in 3D. I give it 8.3 out of 10 only for being slightly dare I say it cheesy in parts. Watch this if you loved Lord of the Rings. And if you haven't seen them even better wait and watch all 6 in chronological order! But good luck to you sir/madam you are a more patient soul than I."
"ayoreinf","9","4","9","17 January 2013"," Peter Jackson makes amends
","Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of LoTR, I've red the book about a dozen of times starting from 1979 until a few years ago, and I didn't like Jackson's treatment of the story. I have two main bones of contention with his approach, the first, while Tolkien keeps telling us all through his stories ""there's much more to middle earth than I'll ever be able to tell you"" Jackson chose an opposite approach of I'm telling you all there is in the story and weeded out everything that could've hinted differently. He also committed an even worse sin of translating what Tolkien referred to as sensations, feelings and suspicions into actual screen events. And to top it all he made some specifically bad changes to the original story. So I came in to the movie practically ready to hate The Hobbit. As you may see from the rating I gave this movie, I didn't hate it at all. In fact I was positively surprised. Jackson's technical mastery is still there, but that was never in doubt. His all inclusive approach is also present here, but it doesn't hurt the story, it moves ahead along the lines Tolkien has laid so perfectly even if the story has a lot added some from other Tolkien stories, some from the imagination of Jackson and his crew. But as long as it remains true to the spirit of the original story and characters I think Jacson is entitled to do so. It does make a small story that was supposed to be the gate into Middle Earth for children into an epic, but it does maintain some levity at many moments and since the prequel to the LoTR became a sequel anyhow, and like it or not we're all familiar with the epic conclusion it's another transgression I'm willing to forgive this time. Truth is, I think the simpler attitude Tolkien used all through this story helps Jackson a lot - since the story is simple and straight forward, there were a lot less traps for him to fall into, and he also got a better feel for Tolkien's creation by now, so he stays the course without failing this time, which makes it all a real visual feast. Read the book, and go and enjoy the ride with Jackson and his version - it's worth the time and the money."
"lasttimeisaw","6","4","9","16 January 2013"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
","A plain 2D version at the local multiplex, culminating my not-so-frenetic film-viewing activity of 2012. The first chapter of this contentiously extended THE HOBBIT trilogy from Peter Jackson revisits the familiar ground in New Zealand, with Bilbo recounts his tall-tale with Gandolf and thirteen dwarfs (strangely their purpose of their journey seems to be deliberately dodged, for viewers who have not read the novel, the journey itself is conspicuously ""unexpected and unexplained""). <br/><br/>In light of my growing fondness towards THE LORD OF THE RING trilogy, I had my wishful thinking that this film could kick off with a competent start, which would be a pipe dream to eclipse THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001, 9/10), but at least to re-ignite certain amount of evocation of the land once brought us amazement and awe. And on this ground, the film has indeed only fulfilled its primary undertaking with its breathtaking skirmishes with trolls, goblins, orcs and other monsters (dragons excluded though), but fails to spike any refreshing ingredient into that wonderland. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson has to stuff the less-epic expedition with viable accessories to slide smoothly in its almost 160 minutes length (which may further spark the profit-seeking rapacity behind the trilogy contrivance whose plausible excuse has never been elucidated otherwise). The competence of the renowned-and-much-anticipated CGI technology and the innovative 48fps HFR (High Frame Rate) terminology surprisingly backfires quite harshly due to the diminishing ramifications of the epic sensation which audience demand fervently and preferably upon the franchise. <br/><br/>The film is a re-run of forming the pack, with elves intervening, but the best part has to be the Golem vignette (which might sadly insinuate that Golem is Peter Jackson's career apex and barrier ahead), so melancholically deployed to summon all the empathy from THE LORD OF THE RING TRILOGY followers.<br/><br/>The massive cast comprises some well-beloved returning immortal figures (McKellen is overpowering while Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee and Elijah Wood's cameos cannot register any thrill) and a young Bilbo (Martin Freeman is shortchanged here since the novel is called THE HOBBIT) with a clutch of dwarfs to be barely discernible to identify their respective names, with Richard Armitage trying desperately to simulate a Viggo Mortensen embodiment. <br/><br/>So, under whatever different circumstances in regard of expectation, the film is a jolly cocktail of a series of roller-coaster adventures and a chirpily reminiscent runaway train, anyway its rosy box office shows basically audience are quite merciful during the Christmas season, so let's wish the miracle will continue occurring to Jackson not once, but twice."
"SchimoCro","7","4","9","10 January 2013"," Too serious and dark approached in screening of novel which just isn't nor serious nor dark
","The perfect visual impression, excellent music and great scenery are fully anticipated positives of the last Jackson's movie adaptation of Tolkien's works, but that is, more or less, where the positives stop. After a slow and uninteresting, but visually and emotionally nice beginning, in which we see how and why did dwarfs went on their journey and how Bilbo ends up with them, story evolves in even more slower and not too interesting bunch of relatively unconnected adventures. Book intended to be children story and this movie as children movie would be great, but Jackosn's too serious and too dark approach, like one in Lord of the Rings which are more darker stories, made most of the movie torn between something like half comedy children story and dark and strong wannabe Lord of the Rings story. Indestructibility of group of dwarfs is also terribly unserious even despite it is a fantasy film. Forest wizard with sleighs which are driven by big rabbits and big thick goblins who perform strongly and fall from one touch while telling a joke, just aren't characters for the movie Jackson wanted to made. There is also too often use of deus ex machina which is making the movie even less serious. Comedy sequences are great and very funny and they even fit in dark atmosphere, but basically they are just one more element which is making this story childish. A lot of attention was given to unimportant dialogues and scenes while many details are left vaguely, as eagles that help only partially, Saruman and Elvish opposition to return of dwarfs, Gandalf power in a one and weakness in other situations, and even the choice of Bilbo. While the CGI scenes were done almost perfectly, the one without it look amateurish. Camera often hides more than shows, and type of filming dialogues is like one in the soap operas. These were a huge disappointments. On the other hand, acting deserves applause, although not too big. Too serious and dark approached in screening of novel which just isn't nor serious nor dark is a fundamental mistake. Despite big backlog when compared with first trilogy, The Hobbit, if anything else, brings beautiful visualization and solid entertainment."
"woodiphora","3","4","9","10 January 2013"," Good in parts, but overblown CGI effects and lack of empathy ruins it.
","It had good parts. I enjoyed Martin Freeman's performance in the earlier part of the movie, and the earlier part of the movie in general - because it did play to human interest, but this rapidly evaporated.<br/><br/>CGI very much took over as the movie went on, and on an overwhelming scale. It's like watch an action movie with lots of explosions - after so many one ceases to care any more. There was also a lack of reality (yes, I know it is fantasy!). If a character can harmed by a sword cut then they definitely wouldn't survive multiple falls down cliff faces and into bottomless chasms.<br/><br/>On many occasions the CGI just didn't look right. Gollum, when he appeared, reminded me more of a TV commercial character in the way every second was filled with a movement or facial expression. Likewise with some other characters. 10/10 for effort - this is close to as good as it gets - there is just far, far too much. The canvas is very overworked.<br/><br/>Lastly, too much dialog. Characters rarely stopped jabbering, and it didn't do anything for me in adding enjoyment or plot development.<br/><br/>Sorry, but I just didn't buy this. To balance things out, not a 'bad' movie - I'd happily watch it again, perhaps two or three times, but ultimately forgettable. My wife, incidentally, liked it, and the twelve year old neighbors daughter we took loved it!"

","It will doubtless come as no surprise to you that I'm a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (no one was more delighted than me when The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King won its Best Picture Oscar, and well deserved it was!). But while you might think that's to the movie-maker's advantage, it isn't. Sure, I'm predisposed to like the film. On the other hand, you do not mess with something as beloved as Tolkien's masterpiece! Director/Producer Peter Jackson didn't disappoint with his Lord of the Rings series, and I'm truly pleased to say that — so far, at least — he's managed to engineer the same feat with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (part 1 in a series of 3).<br/><br/>The Hobbit takes place sixty years before the events that unfold in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. A much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is unexpectedly approached by a wizard he scarcely remembers having met as a child. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) wants Bilbo to go on an adventure, something the stay-at-home hobbit has absolutely zero interest in accepting. But when his home is effectively invaded by a troupe of dwarfs led by heir-to-the-throne Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Bilbo becomes even more certain that adventure is not for him! <br/><br/>Suffice it to say that a combination of envy, shame, and a desire for something beyond his own environment convinces Bilbo in the end to join the quest of the dwarfs: to take back the Kingdom of Erebor stolen from them decades ago by the greedy and vicious fire-breathing dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>Though he knows the journey won't be an easy one, Bilbo is taken aback by the hardships of life on the road which are only exacerbated by the fact the dwarfs are less than impressed with the hobbit or any abilities he might or might not have. Gandalf, however, maintains that Bilbo has hidden depths and that he'll admirably suit the group's need for someone with the skills of a burglar (which, of course, Bilbo steadfastly denies he has).<br/><br/>Along the way, the travelers run into any number of impediments ranging from marauding orcs to duplicitous goblins, to say nothing of mountain trolls, giant spiders, or wizards who appear to be just a little less than entirely sane. And, of course, there are the elves, led by Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and advised by the Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). But perhaps the most dangerous and important creature to surface in their travels is met by Bilbo alone: the warped and undeniably psychotic Gollum who loses his most precious possession for which he blames Bilbo.<br/><br/>Although the script (penned by a team including Jackson himself and Guillermo del Toro, originally tapped to direct) diverges from the book (a certain Orc, for example, plays a pivotal role), it holds beautifully to Tolkien's vision. (In fairness, the added parts are also Tolkien's; they're part and parcel of extensive appendices Tolkien crafted to further flesh out his intricate creation of Middle Earth.) It includes moments of humor which are welcome, as well as some surprisingly deep emotion.<br/><br/>In some ways, it's the special effects that make or break movies like this no matter the caliber of the acting (very good), the direction (excellent), or the editing (also very good). It's also typically my favorite part of any movie like this, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey lives up to expectation. Given the extensive use of CGI, I'm amazed to have only seen a split second or two that might have been improved upon, and I'm still lost in jaw-dropping wonder at an extended battle scene that takes place in the goblin tunnels. I'd like to say that the special effects are brilliant, but that word really isn't sufficient. Though the 3D treatment wasn't strictly needed, I can't lie: It, too, was beautifully rendered and, in my opinion, added to the reality of even the most unreal of moments. Of course, the actual location of the filming doesn't hurt, either. A trip to New Zealand is so on my bucket list! <br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, you'll love seeing so much of what you've read come to vibrant life before your eyes. If you're not a fan of The Hobbit, you will be if you see this movie! I was a little concerned with the length since I'm not one to sit still for long if I'm not completely engrossed. Perhaps my best recommendation for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, then, is to tell you that the nearly three hours' run time flew by for me. I literally couldn't believe the movie was over already!<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: It's interesting, especially in light of recent debates in Washington, to see how greed can so thoroughly corrupt even previously decent leaders. It's even more heartening to see that there are those who still (as Thorin Oakenshield says concerning his rag-tag company) value ""loyalty, honor, a willing heart..."" more than anything else, and who are willing to fight for what's decent and right.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is rated PG-13 ""for extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence, and frightening images."" The violence, though of a fantasy nature, is sometimes quite graphic; the suspense is beyond what younger children could easily handle. The storyline is also complex enough that younger children aren't going to understand it. Most of us read The Hobbit for the first time when we're 12 or 13 at youngest; The Lord of the Rings is typically read even later than that. And that's frankly not a bad gauge to consider when you wonder if this is a movie for your kids."
"Blitz014","6","4","9","6 January 2013"," A movie not able to live up to its expectations.
","Peter Jackson's The Hobbit has hit cinemas with a hype collected by his previous The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Ian McKellen (Lord of the Rings) reprises his role as Gandalf while Martin Freeman (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) plays a young Bilbo Baggins. For those who do not know, The Hobbit is a prequel focusing on the tales of Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey as they attempt to take back the original homeland of the Dwarfs with a group of thirteen chosen dwarfs. <br/><br/>As this movie was released by itself, I will not be taking into account what could potentially happen, or if improvements made within the future ones. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson's use of CGI is very well done. This is highly prevalent within multiple scenes, however stands out within Gollum's scenes. Jackson has done well with utilising technology along with Andy Serkis to create a better looking Gollum as well as a very good scene. <br/><br/>The world of Middle Earth is created fantastically. From the beautiful city of Riverdale alongside its waterfalls to the fantastic like homes of the Hobbits in The Shire, Jackson creates it so well that it immerses the audience. The inhabitants are also complemented alongside the lore of the film with the use of CGI. In other words, Jackson shows that Middle Earth is never boring.<br/><br/>The use of costumes has been done well, as expected. The audience is further immersed with the different armours that both the Elven forces and the dwarven forces possess, as an example.<br/><br/>The Hobbit's story is average. While it does have evidence of its Lord of the Ring roots within it, it can be seen as a bit redundant with the use of its unneeded action scenes as well as the lack of character development (which will be discussed below)<br/><br/>When watching the movie, I found that the characters were not very memorable. Jackson has seemed to replace the Fellowship, a group of memorable characters which I had grown to learn and love, with a ragtag group of stereotypical dwarfs. Character development is most non- existent as the story does not go into enough detail explaining each individual character and their motives and as such, I became distant with the characters - even the charismatic King Thorin.<br/><br/>That being said, Bilbo Baggins' character development is evident and quite well received. As the viewers travel with Bilbo, we can see his eventual transformation into his scared and timid nature to an adventurer. <br/><br/>Relationships are pretty standard within The Hobbit. Due to the dwarfs having almost non-existent personalities, much relationship potential between them and Bilbo is lost. What really stands out, however, is the progression between Bilbo and Thorin, who begin as indifferent.<br/><br/>The Hobbit's soundtrack is very nice and varied, which gives a very nice touch to the movie. From the upbeat dwarven melodies to the melancholy ones, it gives the audience a nice transition into the film and into the next films.<br/><br/>Many of the action scenes, I thought, were not required to be in the film. It could be seen as a time filler, or even potentially a way for time length to be at par with the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Despite having the expectations of being as legendary as the Lord of The Rings and the fan base, it fails to live up to it. However, when set aside from the trilogy, it is quite a solid movie. For those who are new to Middle Earth and its inhabitants, I recommend the original trilogy. However, for die hard fans of the original trilogy as well as fantasy goers, this is a flick you do not want to miss."

It is like a storybook coming to life in 3D it is so wonderful. The whole family will love seeing the charts most of all the kids will love this movie most of all. It is a little dark and it has a little stuff that maybe a little bit too much for some kids like talking about drugs and having wine and beer and stuff like that but besides all of that the kids and the whole family will enjoy this masterpiece.

"rgiamaios","8","4","9","4 January 2013"," A well-fit adaptation to the infamous fable.
","A quiet and peaceful hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, having never known danger and adventure, is called to suddenly embark for an unexpected journey.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, Ian McKellen's performance is enjoyable albeit conventional. The choice of Martin Freeman playing Bilbo was a pleasant surprise as he inarguably draws the attention of the audience with his witty performance. No wonder Peter Jackson insisted on him. The dwarfs bunch serve well, either for comic-relief or for a couple of formidable moments.<br/><br/>While the book features no stylistic continuity with the LotR trilogy, the movie clearly recognizes its predecessor and strives to appear familiar to the fans. As such, the appearances of some LotR characters are to be expected, even when the book doesn't supposes to. Some well-known musical tunes are back as well. Despite these, the overall theme of the movie remains slightly deviant to the trilogy and more loyal to the original, ""fairy-taleish"" material. We see strange creatures and weird, comedic situations, giants and magic more often than not.<br/><br/>The director's decision to cut the story in three separate films allows time for an explicit introduction (to the point that it may tire) and adequate character development. Those who expect closure though will be disappointed.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a deserving prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy and a well-fit adaptation to the infamous fable known as ""The Hobbit: There and Back Again"". It's nearly everything it could be, no more nor less."
"axel-koch","3","4","9","31 December 2012"," Too much running time for too little substance, but amazing visuals!
","The two things that make ""An Unexpected Journey"" not that good as we all have hoped are its length and the inappropriate funny stuff Jackson mixes into it. The dwarfs and their burping and quaffing destroy the mystic feeling of Middle-earth and turn the movie into a unfunny comedy. Luckily, only the first third of the film is ruled by the dwarfs, the rest is focused on the great battles and the wonderful views of Tolkien's world. But Peter Jackson's habit to turn every little story, as tiny as it may be, into a three-hour-picture is really pesky. Less dwarfs, less battles, less pseudo-humorous talk and we would've got a much better film. But after all, the first part of The Hobbit is dominated by the Oscar- deserving visuals and acoustics, a mostly felicitous cast and fantasy stuff, that is simply amazing to see. Just because of the 3D, the cinema ticket is worth its price. Eventually, you have to keep in mind that this is only the initiation to a hopefully marvelous journey."
"GenericBadGuy","7","4","9","30 December 2012"," Whatever the word is, unexpected isn't it
","I'm going to start by admitting, I'm not the biggest fan of fantasy, let alone The Lord of the Rings. I can see why people love them, they are well directed films and look magnificent. However I can't over look some of the sketchy acting and serious moments that I can't help but laugh at. That said I was actually looking forward to seeing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and does it improve on Lord of the Rings, eh.<br/><br/>If any of you have read the book you already know the story. The short version is Gandalf wants reclusive Hobbit Bilbo Baggins to join him in an adventure in claiming back the Dwarfs homeland of Erebor which was taken over by Smaug the Dragon. The truth is while The Hobbit does improve on some accounts, I only laughed at the intentionally funny parts this time, the exciting scenes are just as exciting as the exciting Lord of the Rings but the boring scenes are just as boring as the boring scenes in Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately the boring sections are the ones that are long and drawn out. It also feels like it drags with the 2 hour 49 minute running time feeling more like 3 hours 49 minutes, which isn't a good thing. It's not like Fight Club where it feels long because they manage to fit a lot into the running time, it feels long because the film doesn't keep your interest up.<br/><br/>Now, you're probably wondering why I've given it a good rating considering I've bashed it so much. The truth is. when The Hobbit gets things right it gets them really right. The massive visual set pieces are as exciting here as they were in Lord of the Rings and the back story of the dwarfs at the beginning is one of the most intriguing fantasy back stories I have ever seen. Also like it's predecessors it looks magnificent with the sweeping shots of New Zealand looking suitably epic, however I didn't see it in 48 FPS or 3D so I can't comment on whether they detract or add to the films experience. Also the acting is no where near as sketchy as before with amazing performances by Ian Mckellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Aiden Turner. But by far the stand out performance in the film and once again steals the movie is Andy Serkis reprising his role as Gollum. It is amazing what Serkis is able to do with just his movements and the way he is able to shift between personalities is unparallelled.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very good entry to the series and in my opinion is the best out of the 4. However, I can't over look the boring parts which are unfortunately the parts that are overly long, not to mention the overly long run time which has scenes that should have been saved for the extended edition. The people who will really get the most out of this film are the people who consider The Lord of the Rings some of their favourite films of all time which unfortunately, isn't me. For that reason The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very good movie but won't be making it into my top 10 films of the year."
"mrwhiteman","7","4","9","25 December 2012"," Not as good as it could have been
","Peter Jackson created something so reminiscent of LOTR that is looks like he is lacking new ideas. Many shots, scenes and even lines were almost copy-pasted. Hobbit is my favorite fairytale, and I expected the film to retain all the magic of the book. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It was just another blockbuster for Christmas, not more. Partially it has to do with Peter Jackson himself - his directing style was appropriate for LOTR, but not for Hobbit. He made it too realistic for children's book. What I imagined while reading the book was a mysterious land of Middle Earth, with a lot of fog and dark shadows. What I got in the film was sunlit tundra. Another thing which ruined the magic for me was the use of digital cameras for filming. Images they are able to acquire simply lack the gorgeous look of celluloid, which we all are used to associate with movies. Jackson has explained that digital cameras allowed him to shoot 3d, and were cheaper and easier. But what matters for me is the image quality and impression I get from the movie, not how hard or easy it was for filmmakers to create it. I also don't need this gimmick 3D. Overall, if you just wanna watch another blockbuster on your holidays - it will not disappoint you. If you have read the book and are a Tolkien fan - it will."
"kevinmorice","5","8","23","15 December 2012"," Where to start?
","Where to start with this?<br/><br/>Well I am going to start half an hour after the film, with the seasick feeling and the headache I had for the rest of the night. If 48fps is the future of cinema then cinema is finished. It did make the images and motion slightly clearer, but all that did was make it harder to get drawn into the film and afterwards it left me seasick.<br/><br/>Now to the film itself. There is the obvious problem that everyone was already aware of that such a small book doesn't warrant being stretched into such a long film, never mind three films. But the money men at the film companies obviously knew better so irrelevant distractions are shoe-horned in, long tracking shots are stretched to 5 times the length they need to be, the songs are stretched out .... And yet somehow the important sections which are genuine to the book (the trolls and the riddle game) still feel rushed through.<br/><br/>Some of the other quirks that annoyed me to varying degrees: <br/><br/><ul><li>Orcs out in daylight 60 years before the Uruk-hai. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dwarfs playing hackey-sack with the good china. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>James Nesbit just being James Nesbit. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Most of the dwarfs being incidental despite the extra running time. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gandalf's height going up and down compared to the other characters, even within scenes. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Saruman being so openly evil already, so much so that Galadriel and Gandalf sneak around behind his back. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The CGI being much too obvious. (The increased frames just made that look more obvious). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The storm giants were totally wasted. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bilbo is meant to distract the trolls all night but he lasts about 20 seconds! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And how many of the shots were just stolen straight from LOTR. (All the tracking shots, the chase scene, all the Gollum close-ups. A decent editor and dubbing team could have built 80% of the movie from LOTR footage.)</li></ul><br/><br/>I wanted to love this film but I have never been so disappointed. I have seen worse films (plenty of them) but I expected them to be worse. I have seen great directors try to be too clever on the back of their reputation and fail miserably (Avatar). I have seen books ruined by trying to squeeze them onto celluloid (Paycheck, Hunger Games). But never have I seen such awesome base material and a great director, and a great producer, turn out such rubbish."
"CinematicInceptions","7","3","6","25 July 2014"," Solid, but iffy for lovers of the book.
","Since I know nobody really cares about my personal opinion of this movie, I'll give it later and first give The Hobbit an objective overview for any passing moviegoer. The film is good for action lovers, but the majority of the action comes after almost an hour and a half. The climax should not disappoint those who stick with the movie all the way. The storyline is good, but is much easier to follow if you are familiar with the book. There is nothing of significance deleted from the original text, but quite a bit is added, which I know is not always appealing to people who like movies to follow their books exactly. Azog the goblin, who is barely mentioned in the book, is the main villain apart from Smaug. Radagast the brown wizard is given a small role that is not included in the book. The personality and role of the other main characters are retained, though Gollum is used sort of as a comic relief character and Bofur the dwarf seems to get a large amount of screen time. There is an emotional subplot of Bilbo being homesick and unsure of his decision to join the dwarfs' expedition. In my own opinion, the last hour is excellent, especially Bilbo's return speech. There is a little bit too much humor added to what should be a more serious movie. It is not as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy in any regard, but is still a solid movie with a great ending. I very much like Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo, and I especially like his added moment of heroism at the end. The movie is a CGI feast that I would recommend for most middle earth fans and action lovers."

Where LOTR is full of scenes where you can see beautiful surroundings, castles, forests or whatever...the Hobbit (to me) has only one pretty scene, and that's when they arrive at Rivendell.<br/><br/>The ""fights"" between the Dwarfs/Bilbo/Gandalf and the Orcs, etc were nothing more than some pushing and shoving. LOTR already started in the first movie with an Epic Battle! <br/><br/>What I am most disappointed about is the fact that the Orcs and other evil creatures sound like they came straight from Sesame Street. <br/><br/>I keep my fingers crossed that part 2 is a bit better, otherwise its a waist of time and money"
"evanobrien100","6","3","6","28 July 2013"," Where's the magic?
","I definitely felt like the magic of the original trilogy was missing here, the issue isn't so much with making three, three hours films based on thin amounts of source material (with extended editions mind you) which is even testing when you watch the original trilogy. They really don't hand out Oscars for best adapted screenplay for the good of their health.<br/><br/>The problem really lies in the production, it's entirely over extended. It's photographic process resembled an aesthetic similar to a role play, like the police were going to show up at the end a la Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The effects of this are significantly reduced on DVD which is a format I definitely recommend seeing this in. There were way too many CGI effects in some places which again just screams ""THIS IS FAKE!"" or at the very least made it look like a cartoon. The entire movie looks like one big Photoshop. It was a huge disappointment considering how well done the costume design was on the original trilogy. I guess gone are the days where people could make classic movies where the only gimmick they had was a faulty mechanical shark.<br/><br/>This is by no means a bad movie, my high regard of the LOTR movies kept this engaging from start to finish, and I don't really think there's much merit in comparing like movies, however they've made it very clear that Peter Jackson wants these movies on the same shelf, in the same box as the LOTR movies. I just felt really disappointed at how over produced it was and let down because it really was due to adding in the stuff that draws a crowd to the box office and not the tangible elements that make movie classics."

","I am a Tolkien fan having read LOTRs and The Hobbit many times (over 20). I loved Peter Jackson's LOTRs trilogy despite his skateboarding Legolas and slapstick version of Gimli. Gollum was one of the greatest characterisations I have ever seen.<br/><br/>So full marks for The Hobbit then? No - not at all.<br/><br/>The pre-release posters gave a strong hint of what was to come. The Hobbit is a childs book but the lighting on the posters was like something out of Gone With The Wind. Uh-oh, I thought. Jackson's gone epic.<br/><br/>To begin with think Martin Freeman was a mistake. He does a great job at being Martin Freeman the Hobbit - but he just isn't Bilbo. The dwarfs a pretty good but they don't really come over as grim tough fighting types. More like comic stuntmen. Was it really necessary to 'personality' them up to that extent? Thank God that Del Toro didn't get his steam punk way so I will forgive Jackson for things like axes sticking out of heads and Thorin's 'I just come from the hairdressers' look. The Hobbit book is funny but for me the humour in Jackson's version just doesn't match the tone of the movie. A bit like all the Gimli jokes in the LOTR. It's just out of place. The special effects are terrific with Gollum the star again. - but there's too many of them necessitated by Jacksons need to 'big' everything up. Hollywood pressure? The dishwashing scene could have been done with clever camera work and loads of unbreakable dishes instead Jackson felt the need to turn it into a football trick session with the CGI obvious. There was no tension to the scene as we all knew the dishes weren't real. Small effects also seemed hamfisted. Bilbo running to catch the dwarfs seemed to be wearing swimming flippers instead of Hobbit feet. I don't ever remember thinking that in LOTR. Why oh why must there always be sliding scenes ala Spielberg. There have been three already. And the done to death ' grab on by one hand and amazingly pull someone to safety' stunt. I'm not sure Jackson has an original bone in his directing body. Everything in the movie I've seen a thousand times before. I guess my biggest complaint against the movie is the starring of characters that have almost no part in the book. Talking Radagast the Brown and the Pale Ork here. Ridiculously overplayed and turned me from a Jackson fan to a Jackson doubter. Was it really necessary to have completely new characters in the film? Only if there's a need to increase the drama - a need to add special effects to appeal to an audience used to seeing explosions and chases and baddies. And why oh why did the head goblin have a posh accent? For God sake. I could go on - the Troll who was feminine - Galadriel turning on some kind of potters wheel and almost falling over her spiralling dress. The sledge race - and so on and so on. When you think about it Jackson hasn't made a great movie since LOTRs. King Kong was awful, Lovely Bones a flop - The critics don't like the Hobbit - look at the Meta score and I agree. I'm not so sure he's anything more then a average director carried along by his success with LOTR. Which is disappointing, 'cause he's a Kiwi - like me. Final verdict? Could do so much better (I hope)"

","Hobbit Unexpected Journey is in my opinion an average movie. I just don't get it why people would consider it to be one of the greatest movie ever made. There are several reasons in mind:<br/><br/>1. Adapted from the novel written by the author who wrote LORs so this have to be a good movie 2. Directed by the director who directed LORs so this have to be a good movie 3. A lot of dummies who probably have only seen several movies of same genres and can not tell if a movie is good or bad so if someone thinks this is a good movie then this have to be a good movie<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, I don't doubt the quality of Peter Jackson's work, it is simply that the book 'Hobbit' is not supposed to be made into a trilogy. The story 'Hobbit' is good if it could be done in 3 hours, but in 3 movies that add up to roughly 8-9 hours??? No! In 9 hours time you can probably have all the details in the book presented on the screen but as a movie that will be a failure guaranteed. <br/><br/>The most recent time I fell asleep in theaters was watching 'The Hobbit', ironically, I was a huge fan of LOR. <br/><br/>I would rate it as a decent movie, much worse than my expectation. And sometimes the audience's expectation really matters."

","Think about everyone you know who read The Hobbit. They all loved it, right? Think about everyone you know who read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Did more than a few of them actually finish all three books? What makes The Hobbit a better read than the trilogy is exactly what made the Lord of the Rings films easier to take than the books: with the trilogy, Jackson whittled the far too dense story down to its essentials, or rather whittled down the pile of world myth details to find one single story. He made an opposite move with this film, ruining the novel's one advantage over the trilogy, its brevity. Not only did he drag one brief novel's story out over the course of three three hour films, but he added story elements which have only the most superficial connections to the plot at hand. Although the trilogy did well, I don't see this ponderous heap of a film, repeated twice, adding anything to his reputation or the studio's profits."
"tapio_hietamaki","7","3","6","16 June 2013"," An Expected Disappointment
","I tried defending this film to my friends after seeing this. I told them that it's based on a children's book and is supposed to be whimsical. I told them that it has its fair share of cool fantasy battles and beautiful visuals. It was a return to the world we all loved, Peter Jackson's rendition of Middle Earth: we saw familiar places and characters that brought back memories of old times.<br/><br/>Of course I wanted to think the best of this long-awaited film. The truth is, it doesn't really deserve it on its own merits. It's based on a great book and is a prequel to great films, but the context is most of what it's got going for it. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is very long and very light on content. We get endless throwbacks to the previous films, endless CGI landscapes and endless CGI fight scenes with unbelievably stupid stunts. Probably more than half of the film is exposition, and it still doesn't manage to explain everything (where is Thror's ring, for example?) This is not a faithful adaptation. It is not really even faithful to the original Peter Jackson movie trilogy's spirit. The mood swings wildly and without purpose: one minute the exiled dwarven king broods over his lost kingdom, the next an old stoner dude rushes through the forest with his rabbit sled to save a hedgehog.<br/><br/>Visually the film is OK. It's drenched in a golden light that kind of starts to lose its charm when you see so much of it - the same goes for Howard Shore's gorgeous score. I didn't really like the design of the orcs and the wargs as much as in the original films.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is a good choice for Bilbo, though his usual manners get a bit old after three hours. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is obviously brilliant, and Richard Armitage has a profound air of authority and silent grace about him as Thor the dwarf lord. I liked the dwarfs overall, and it was interesting to see Rivendell and the proud elves from their perspective, when we're used to being on the elves' side."
"BA_Harrison","6","3","6","14 April 2013"," The Hobbit: An Expected Disappointment.
","I approached The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey with trepidation, fearful that Peter Jackson, a director whose career was born of excess, would go unnecessarily way over the top, as he sometimes did with his The Lord of The Rings trilogy (particularly Return of the King), and pretty much all of the time with King Kong (unforgivable, seeing as he already had a perfect cinematic blueprint to work from).<br/><br/>And go way over the top he does. Frequently.<br/><br/>With the film split into three parts in order to milk as much cash as possible from Tolkien fans, Jackson is given plenty of opportunity for bloated action scenes, the adventure becoming more preposterous as it progresses, its characters surviving the most perilous situations, often with little more than a scratch to show for their remarkably lucky escape from almost certain doom. The use of crude humour is also excessive, designed to please younger audience members for whom burps and bogies are comedy gold, but a lot less funny for adults.<br/><br/>But perhaps what is most frustrating about The Hobbit is that, despite all of the expensive CGI laden effects sequences and the silly slapstick from its band of merry dwarfs, the film's finest and funniest moment takes place in the peace and solitude of an underground cavern between just two characters, reminding us of what a great director Jackson can be when it matters. If only there had been more movie-making of this calibre during the three hours it took to tell only one third of what is a comparatively short book. Sigh!<br/><br/>6/10, a rating which some people might think is far too high given my review, but I sure ain't giving it less than I gave that damn giant ape catastrophe."

","Compared to LOTR this is a major disappointment. As one who bought LOTR on blu-ray in their extended editions because of the magnificent quality of the films it is hard for me to accept such a follow-up effort. The decision to stretch this to 3 films has ruined it. The story plods, with nothing more than one action sequence after another tying it together. Unfortunately the action sequences are utterly unbelievable with hardly a scratch to show for a battle with thousands or a fall that should kill. There is a line to be drawn between fantasy and a lack of reality and it has not been drawn at all here. The CGI is obviously CGI in many places too which I found frankly puzzling given how well it blended in on LOTR. Doubtless when all 3 films have been released they will again release an even more pointless extended edition. I earnestly hope some enterprising soul edits these down to the one film it should have been all along. It can only be better."

","THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY<br/><br/>I am a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies... I have never read the books though. When I heard this movie was being made, I made it my mission to read the book before the film came out.<br/><br/>The book is awesome... I loved it. The movie is also very good, but there are bits I am disappointed with.<br/><br/>I think the film is a really good movie, but there is absolutely no need to stretch it out into a trilogy. I know in Hollywood it's all about the money... but this story does feel very stretched. The book of the Hobbit is about a third in length of Fellowship of the Ring, so surely it should only be one movie?!?<br/><br/>The thing with Peter Jackson in my opinion is his movies are too long. He makes some amazing films, but they are too long for my liking. King Kong for instance is a really good movie, but the first 90 minutes really should have only been 25 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a really good film. The effects are great, the story is great and the characters are really good... especially Gollum.<br/><br/>I felt that the beginning of the movie was very good, the ending was very good but the middle was very stretched out. I thought the middle slowed down a little bit too much and should have been shorter.<br/><br/>The way the movie ended makes me wonder how they could stretch it out into 2 more movies though... they got quite far in their journey in the first movie alone.<br/><br/>The casting was brilliant. Martin Freeman plays a really good Bilbo Baggins. He looks like he could get older and look like Ian Holm. It was also very good to see some of the old cast from LOTR back to reprise their roles in this... Elijah Wood made an appearance. It was also good to see the legend that is Christopher Lee back.<br/><br/>I really did enjoy this film and will give it 8 out of 10...<br/><br/>I can't wait for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"thegatten","5","9","27","14 December 2012"," READ THIS if you are thinking about watching this in the cinema
","I just watched the movie in the cinema and as i had feared i was terribly disappointed. I think ""The Hobbit"" is one more movie added to the long string of ""big budget spectacular movies"" that could have been so much more. The whole movie revolves around a group who has to get from A to B, much similar to the concept in LOTR. Unfortunately the movie fails so bad. There is no large wars and way too few fights, and the fights that actually occur fails to really catch your interest because there is a lack of connection between the audience and the main characters and a lack of ""hate"" against the bad guys. In my opinion, a movie like this has to really make the audience connect with the main characters so that you are cheering for them every step of the way through all the obstacles on their journey, and this is even more important if you don't have any large wars or large spectacular fight scenes to keep hold of the audience. All this, or rather the lack of it, resulted in me sitting for 2 and a half hours bored to death by looking at 12 dwarfs, a wizard and a hobbit just traveling... Sure there is a few fight scenes and a few vaguely interesting encounters but absolutely nothing spectacular and at no point during the movie are you really sitting on the edge of your seat curling your toes and completely taken away by the courage and power of the heroes.. And to be honest i think this has become a sad trend in the big budget Hollywood movies.. Movies that could have been so much more than they were.. If i were to sum up this movie in 1 word it would be: Indifferent. That word fits so perfect to this movie.. It is not total crap and it is absolutely not good either.. It is watchable due to the beautiful scenery as we know it from LOTR and thats it!"
"sm-boyde","6","9","27","14 December 2012"," Moments of magic, but not enough for 3 hours
","I've been a fan of the Tolkien books since my father read us The Hobbit when I was 5. Granted that a movie does not need to faithfully reproduce the book, but I think this film was best when Jackson stayed close to the books (Hobbit and Silmarillion) and worst when he added gratuitous stuff to suck in the teen-boy audience (the bad-cowboy-movie subplot with Thorin vs the white orc).<br/><br/>The depiction of the dwarfs didn't make sense. Some were Disney-style grotesques (e.g. Dwalin, Bombur); some, the ones we were supposed to identify with as characters, were just little handsome humans (e.g. Thorin, Fili, Kili).<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were some passages of magic. Smaug attacking the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo's meeting with Gollum, Barry Humphrey's amazing performance as the Goblin King. The dwarfs trashing Bilbo's larder and then juggling his crockery - that was fun. Hmmm... maybe too few moments in 3 hours..."
"reza_marvel","9","6","16","24 December 2012"," The best adventure movie in years
","The Hobbit manages to capture the same feel of the lord of the rings. It's great to see a sequel that isn't necessary bigger but is an expansion on the lore. I know the Hobbit was written first by Tolkien, but for a lot of people who have only seen the movies (like me) it's a prequel. But even if you haven't seen the lotr movies (what's wrong whit you) it can still be enjoyed. <br/><br/>The environment and costumes are gorgeous, the action scene's are some it the best i've seen in a while and I really laughed a lot at this movie. I can't see anyone getting bored or underwhelmed by this awesome fantasy quest. I can't wait for part 2 and see more of Bilbo Baggins, Gandolf and the awesome Thorin Oakenshield."
"Bruce722","9","6","16","21 December 2012"," Can't wait for the second installment!
","If you liked The Lord of the Rings movies than you'll like this film. The visuals are absolutely incredible and it has that familiar LOTR feel that we all know and love. I couldn't quite give it a 10/10 for a few reasons. For one, there are so many characters that most of them have absolutely zero development whatsoever. Frodo gets more screen time than some of the dwarfs and that's really unfortunate. Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin are the focus of the film, as they should be, but the rest of the dwarfs are essentially filler in the movie. I don't know how Peter Jackson could've done this differently without making the movie even longer (and it's already about 3 hours) so it's really just the nature of the content that has trouble transitioning to film. Secondly, the feel, while similar to LOTR, doesn't seem as epic. When watching Lord of the Rings, even after already having watched it before, there's a sense of awe that this film doesn't quite capture to the same degree. Regardless, the movie is outstanding and I have a feeling that if watching all three films back-to-back-to-back (when they're released that is), it will come off much better. I can't wait for the second installment."
"kolar1","8","6","16","18 December 2012"," Don't let the nay-sayers spoil your fun - How many chances do you get to be a kid again?
","When I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as a result of wanting to know more about the story behind the 1977 animated special, I got a very clear picture in my head of what a live-action movie would look like. I've gazed at Alan Lee and John Howe artwork through the years, played Middle-Earth Roll Playing (MERP), and collected graphic novels, still wondering if a descent movie would ever be made (or in the case of the Ralph Bakshi attempt, completed). Finally, December of 2001 arrived and I was able to see the vision that I'd carried in my head for so long given life when I sat spellbound for three whirlwind hours with a smile stretched across my face.<br/><br/>I'm not a Peter Jackson disciple, okay. I thought King Kong sucked eggs. But Jackson and his small group of writers were able to do what no one had ever done before. First of all, they made a movie about a treasured classic that most of the fans appreciated. But more importantly, they were able to talk the studios into letting them handle each book in the Rings trilogy as a separate movie and film them all at once. Obviously, it payed off. Most of the story was kept intact as each film stretched for three-plus hours, not to mention the sprawling uncut versions that would be released on DVD.<br/><br/>Jackson's vision was so successful that he was able to perform yet another feat when it came time to pitch The Hobbit: he turned one book into three movies. I saw the first of the new trilogy and was again awed by the attention to detail and the love of the material. Jackson loves these stories, folks. He went to bat this time to tell the full story without having to edit a thing. So far, I have not been disappointed by the omission of anything. He's got nine hours in which to tell the story of The Hobbit. The book is only a little over 300 pages, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>So, in order to keep from cutting any of the parts we know and love, Jackson had to sample tales and characters from other Tolkien Middle-Earth works to move the story at the right pace. How else are you going to split a novel into thirds, people? Where is a good cut-off point for the end of the next movie-Bilbo sneaking into the Lonely Mountain and seeing the dragon? Sure, fans will love that! Jackson had to take a piece of a book and reshape it into a mini-story that would provide all the elements of a good movie: setting, conflict, plot, characters, and theme.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that some of the battle scenes were almost impossible to differentiate from those of the LOTR. Also, there were just so many ""saved in the nick of time"" moments I rolled my eyes once.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I don't agree with the uproar about the differences between the novel and the movie so far. All the things I wanted to see were there, and then some. I suspect it will be the same in the next two. I will set quietly for three hours again and again, staring at the screen and feeling once again like I'm twelve and carefree and adventure is around every corner."
"kim-spruill","8","6","16","18 December 2012"," Always a fan of P.J. but enough CGI already!
","I LOVED Lord of the Rings. Each movie I saw several times in the theater. Once the extended versions came out, I watched every bit of them, even the commentaries. I was addicted. So unfortunately The Hobbit will be compared to those movies, can't be helped.<br/><br/>I was so excited for The Hobbit, it one of my favorite books from childhood. Overall I enjoyed the movie. I tend to not read any reviews because I just go with the goal of enjoying a good story. That way I don't have any expectations or someone's opinions in my head. So, yes, I enjoyed the movie but something kept nagging at me over the next few days. I went and saw it again, and I noticed I wasn't having that feeling like I did with LOTR, total addiction. So what was it? I liked the dwarfs, goofy characters, sure there's a lot of them but I still liked them. I connected with a few of them, mainly the ones that had more screen time. I personally like how the story connected to LOTR, so no problem with that. By the way, Kate Blanchett, beautiful!! Bilbo was great, but I'm a fan of Martin Freeman, so maybe I'm a little biased. To figure out what was bugging me, I threw in my DVD of LOTR when I got home. It didn't take long for me to find out what I didn't like about The Hobbit. <br/><br/>First, 3-D. What's the deal with using it? To me, it's distracting. I don't think it's necessary for telling a good story. It doesn't actually draw me into the movie more. Half the time it makes the move look fake. What I mean by fake is that my brain doesn't believe I could actually go to that world. In LOTR, Two Towers, Return of the King, I actually believed I could go to that world and be a part of it. Now here comes a 3-D version of Middle Earth and I don't believe it.<br/><br/>Second, CGI. Yes, it is necessary for some things. It was used in the first three movies but for some reason it was believable. I hated, HATED Azog! Why, please tell me why, a CGI character was used instead of someone wearing full hair, makeup, and prosthetics. Let's just say Lurtz could kick Azogs butt anytime, anywhere! At least based on how they looked on screen. With Lurtz (the main Uruk-Hai from LOTR) you saw the blood, the ooziness, the ickiness of who he was. The teeth, the eyes, the ability to pull an actual dagger from his thigh, was awesome! Now here comes the next big baddie, and he looks like a character from I Am Legend. A pale looking vampire thing. So not awesome. I didn't feel he was a threat at all, he just yelled a lot. I don't know if it's possible but is there any way a real actor could be put in his place for the rest of the movies? Now, we come to the goblins. It reminded me of a moment in one of the new Star Wars movies where I just thought I was watching a video game. Let's again compare to a familiar scene, the escape from Moria. In LOTR, the escape from Moria was and still is exciting. Sure at one point there were a bunch of Orcs surrounding the Fellowship but they looked believable. The goblins in The Hobbit made it look like I was watching a cartoon. The escape from the goblins was, well, annoying.Too many fake creatures.<br/><br/>So, overall, I enjoyed the move. I am apparently not a fan of 3-D or CGI or maybe I am not a fan when they aren't used well. I am excited to see the other movies coming up. Some people don't like that Peter Jackson added to the story but I don't mind. I love the history lessons and besides I was one of the odd people that actually read through the Appendices at the end of Return of the King. I like stories being expanded beyond what was written in the actual book.<br/><br/>And even though some of the technical things annoyed me, I will most likely go see this movie again. I haven't seen the high frame speed version yet, so gotta go!"
"currywh1998","6","6","16","17 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey-A great film that will always live in the shadow of its predecessor
","Sir Peter Jackson's adaption of J.R.R Tolkiens epic, The Lord of the Rings, was a masterpiece. The audience's attachment to the characters was unparalleled as was the cinematography and vistas. Ten years later, Peter Jackson's adaption of The Hobbit has hit theaters with much anticipation. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey stars newcomer Martin Freeman in the title role as Bilbo Baggins; Freeman plays the role perfectly with distinction while capturing the innocence and skepticism of a Hobbit. Richard Armitage plays Dwarven prince Thorin Oakenshield; he captures the roughness of the character while also portraying the loyalty to his race and his evolving ""kingliness"". Returning are Ian McKellan as Gandalf, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian Holm as an elderly Bilbo, and Andy Serkis as Gollum.<br/><br/>Unlike the Fellowship, in the Hobbit, you never really get to know each and every dwarf. In the Fellowship of the Ring characters were introduced at different points during the story, allowing room for expansion. In An Unexpected Journey, all 13 of the dwarfs are thrown (literally) at the audience in rapid succession, allowing no room for further character development. Nonetheless, you do get the sense that the dwarfs have a strong bond as warriors and comrades. Standouts among the dwarfs include Thorin, Balin, and Bofur. To illustrate my point, I don't think Bombur said a word the whole movie! Jackson also brings Radagast the brown into his adaption. Radasgast was not seen in the book; his character in the movie borders on ridiculousness but due to the lighter-tone his ridiculousness is part of the fun.<br/><br/>Jackson made the decision to turn the Hobbit into a trilogy mainly because he pulled material from the appendices of the Return of the King, such as the white council. Personally, I think that two films would have been perfect for the Hobbit. Two films would have given Jackson enough time to make a loyal translation of the book without making a literal translation. At some points during An Unexpected Journey, you can tell that a certain sequence was drawn out in order to make the film a trilogy. Such as the battle scene between two rock giants. The Hobbit involves great acting and visual effects, and humor. The Hobbit is a light-hearted story and the humor fits perfectly within the movie, hitting at the right spots. Contrary to the general opinion, I did not feel like the film was drawn out, the three hours flew by quickly and I also did not think that the beginning was slow, in fact I thought that the time in Bag End was one of the best sequences in the whole movie. It was the ""deep breath before the plunge"".<br/><br/>After the company leaves Rivendell, the movie is pretty much non-stop action. While entertaining, the overuse of CGI made some of the action sequences look very fake, especially in the high frame rate. In particular ""the pale orc"" Azog looked like he was ripped straight out of a video game. In Jackson's previous Middle Earth entries most of the villains were actors in makeup, which gave them a living, breathing, and more frightening appearance. A great example of this is Lurtz from the Fellowship of the Ring. The CGI works perfectly for Gollum who looks better than ever. ""Riddles in the Dark"" is easily the best scene in the whole movie. Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for his performance as Gollum.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an exciting, well-acted, visually appealing experience of perfect length full of masterful cinematography, welcome humor and too much CGI. The ""riddles in the dark"" sequence with Gollum is amazing. It may not be quite as emotionally striking as the Fellowship of the ring was because the stakes are not as high; Peter Jackson has six more hours of movie to make us really care about all the characters in the company of dwarfs, I suggest that he uses that time wisely. Still, It is a great start to what will hopefully be another great trilogy. Can't Wait until the blu-ray extended edition is released!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>NOTE: I did see the film in the revolutionary 48fps format. It looked great, I don't understand why so many people don't like it. Anyone who is skeptical should see it in the traditional format. Those who are interested should see it in 48fps."

The story feels fuller and for a nerd like me it is pure heaven.<br/><br/>I have no issues with the small book being made in to three movies. It gives ample time to let fans soak in all the wonder and excitement.<br/><br/>There were some CGI issues I wasn't in love with, but they are minor. I saw the 2D version and had no problem.

","There is already over 200 reviews, so I'm sure everything has been said by now, but I am still going to review it.<br/><br/>My experience before the show was a pain. The path to the theater was blocked so I had to walk and since the room the movie was in was being cleaned the staff made us wait outside in the cold. It was more than worth it. Like all the LOTR movies they're visually impressive and proves that Peter Jackson is the king of blockbusters. It also had some humorous dialogue and when the movie ends it leaves you wanting more. If you're a Elijah Wood fan or the majority of the cast members from the other movies, you're gonna be disappointed because some of them don't appear. The one who appears the most out of all of them is Gandalf. The movie is also a bit less darker than the LOTR trilogy, but I still wouldn't recommend taking young kids to it because it will frighten them. Somehow it doesn't reach the same level of greatness as the LOTR movies did, but it is a great start to the trilogy and hopefully the other two will be better."
"andrewcgates93","9","6","16","15 December 2012"," Great character development and plot momentum but too much CGI.
","This is not a traditional review of The Hobbit, more of a focus on the writing and directorial choices rather than music, acting or high frame rate.<br/><br/>First, I want to make a point about the story itself. This story is the most self-contained of all in the series so far. It has all basic elements, the beginning, the inciting incident, the turning point, the climax just as a regular story structure should. More importantly, it has strong character development. If you compare Frodo from the beginning of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" to the end, he is certainly a different person, but it's less of a dramatic shift. He wasn't nearly as opposed to going on an adventure in the beginning as Bilbo so you didn't get to see as much of a dramatic change as Frodo warms up to the idea. Frodo's inexperience with fighting and combat wasn't nearly as blatant so when he finally starts fighting, it's insignificant. We don't see him grow or change much. Frankly, in the subsequent films after ""Fellowship of the Ring"", Frodo doesn't really change a whole lot at all. We pretty much get a love/hate relationship with Frodo towards the Ring for the entire next two movies with a passable character arc regarding his changing feelings towards Sméagol and Sam. In ""An Unexpected Journey"" we get a much more gripping story of a Hobbit who very clearly did not want to go on an adventure but warms up to the idea of it. He also finds his courage and bravery and wins the heart of Thorin, who undergoes his own character development too. ""An Unexpected Journey"" has the best character development out of all in the series so far and partially for that same reason, this film works better as a standalone piece than the others.<br/><br/>As for the runtime, it was long. But that was not problematic. I didn't have a problem with the runtime and at no point was I thinking to myself ""When is this over?"" I attribute that to its storytelling. This film has the best momentum out of all in the series. With the other movies, there was a wave of action, then some downtime and then the action rose again and then it fell again. There was a constant rise and fall of action throughout. With ""An Unexpected Journey"" you find that the level of action grows consistently as the movie progresses, which helps draw the audience in and bring them along with what's happening on screen. The story built. It didn't just jump right into it like ""Fellowship of the Ring"" did. It's certainly a more gripping and exciting way to tell a story. In fact, the only things I would consider being cut would be the fight between the Stone Giants or the scene when the Dwarfs do Bilbo's dishes. Other than that, everything has its place.<br/><br/>The large flashback battle sequences with the dwarfs, while I would've preferred to see more use of practical effects, didn't so much bother me because as a flashback, it can be more stylized. The reclaiming of Moria for example looked really cool despite having a lot of CG in it. However, it's when you get into things like Azog or the goblins when I feel like CG was used to excess. The other orc villains we've seen in the series were never digitally rendered. They were done using practical effects and they were very creepy. Even the goblins in Moria in ""Fellowship of the Ring"" were done with practical effects rather than digital rendering. It's a generally well accepted fact that if you can do something practically, you should do it. Directors who understand this have made masterpieces using practical effects over CGI. In fact during early pre-production of the movie, back when Guillermo Del Toro was on board as director, Del Toro was pushing for the use of more practical effects. Frankly, despite my absolute love for Peter Jackson, I think in this particular instance, Del Toro would've been the better choice. I think Del Toro's vision for creature design was superior to that of Jackson's. But directors these days choose to push the limits of what they can create visually, despite the more realistic factor produced by the alternative. Jackson has simply fallen victim to this trend. However, despite my criticism of the overuse of GCI, I still am not too bothered by it. I've seen worse. And frankly, it's very good CGI. It's not that the movie is throwing too much CGI at once, it's that it's using CG as a substitute or ""way out"" when it could be doing other things.<br/><br/>The tone of this movie, as expected, is a lot lighter than that of the other Tolkien iterations we've seen. But frankly, that should come as a surprise to no one even vaguely familiar with the story. Yet, Jackson managed to sprinkle some darker elements in there which blend nicely. We get some good foreshadow which will help build ""The Hobbit"" trilogy into ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I think the way Jackson has set this up will make it especially good as one grand arc encompassing the six movie series. That fact also applies in pacing as well. This movie has a slower pace than all the others. When viewed together, the movies will blend really well from one to the next both in pacing and tone.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a very good movie. Bilbo is a much more interesting character than Frodo. We see a lot of character growth. We see a lot of action, but we still get a smaller scaled story. All in all, I think with the exception of some CG choices which honestly don't bother me too much, this movie was done about as well as it could've been."

","I was very young when I first saw ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and it was without questioning one of the greatest sagas of movie franchising. When I heard that Peter was making another trilogy based on Tolkien's book ""The Hobbit"", I thought for myself if he could reach the expectations for the general public, and my answer, after watching the movie, is yes. Despite all inconsistencies with the book which are perfectly normal for this kind of movies I thought that the storyline was great, the characters are very well interpreted and has a lot more action that I was expecting. So, point being: - Just like ""Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring"" this first movie gives us a small taste of whats coming next year with ""The Desolation of Smaug"" and 2014 with ""There and Back Again""; - The storyline is yet opened for some characters to appear in the next movies; - Rivendell is just as great and beautiful as I remember; - Bilbo and Thorin's interpretations are flawless and it really gets us into the story; - The 48FPS ratting didn't make much of a difference for me, but the 3D is also very interactive and detailed; - My favorite scene is of course the Bilbo-Gollum encounter; So, final view: This movie is awesome and none of you should miss it, I advise you to enjoy the 3D version as much as you can and if you don't like this 1st movie, don't worry because just like LotR, Return of the King, the last movie is (always) the one that really can make a difference.

My theatre did not project in 48 fps so I can't comment on that.<br/><br/>Storywise, I think the filmmakers achieved the same level of excellence in translating Tolkien's novel to the big screen as they did with LOTR. All of the key moments and dialogue that fans remember from the book are present in the film. I think they did a good job of staying faithful while expanding on items that the book only discusses in order to bridge the gap between The Hobbit and LOTR more effectively.<br/><br/>The LOTR cameos were very welcome to me. Christopher Lee is always impressive on screen and Cate Blanchett remains one of the most beautiful, and captivating women in the world. I think Jackson does a good job of juggling the huge cast of dwarfs. They're always accounted for.<br/><br/>I noticed marked improvements in CGI work from LOTR. Gollum and the wargs are especially wonderful. Characters like Azog, the Goblin King and the supernumerary goblins were very obviously CG (even if there was motion capture done). However, I think they were done well enough that I wasn't distracted or pulled out of the film by them.<br/><br/>As LOTR did, this film will provide a generation with *the* definitive filmic translation."
"maya-maya","8","6","16","13 December 2012"," Technologically sophisticated and entertaining
","This first Hobbit movie follows the plot of the first half of the book more or less faithfully. If you are wondering - as I did - how Jackson is going to make three movies out of one book, it's by including everything: the good as well as the ridiculous, and supplementing it with a back story out of the appendices of the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>While the plot seems at times disjointed, and people next to me complained that ""nothing much happens for a long time"" it is still (not) happening in Middle-Earth and very much worth seeing. The screenplay is at times subtle, at times very in-your-face. Overall, despite containing dark themes and scenes, the movie is much more lighthearted than Lord of the Rings (as the book was), and the scenery is much more epic than the plot itself.<br/><br/>In 3D, the movie suffers from the same weaknesses as other 3D titles, occasional blurring and center brightness. However colors are still vibrant and at 48 frames per second, the movie is extremely immersive.<br/><br/>Final verdict: 7/10 for the movie, 9/10 for the technology."
"tunisen91","9","6","16","12 December 2012"," Minor disappointment
","The hobbit was really good but there was some things i didn't like and you will probably agree with me. First lets go trough the good things the high framrate was really good and blent in perfectly with action scenes. There was a lot of action in the movie and the flashback of the war of moria was really good.The villain in the movie was really cool and evil. I really recommend seeing this movie because it has a lot to offer. <br/><br/>But there was bad things and its not a masterpiece like many fanboys say in IMDb. Am a huge fan of LOTR but i can see some mistakes and bad work on this movie. The humor is bad and there is way 2 mush Bad humor made for kids in the hobbit. One thing i found really bad is talking rabbits thats narnia kidstyle not lotr it made me mad. Another bad thing was the intro it wasn't epic at all and the sound was horrible. The scenes in the intro didn't make me have the epic feeling i got from Fellowship of the ring intro. And when Saurons spirit came out it was bad made and the scene ended really fast by the wizard fleeing with talking rabbits.I expected mush more from the movie and i can feel that Peter jackson was stressed doing this movie. The 3d was horrible i would rather see it without. I give it 9.5/10 Best adventure ever!<br/><br/>Overall the movie was really good but i expect a masterpiece from part 2."
"thefilmgourmet","10","7","20","19 December 2012"," If you even remotely like fantasy, watch it !
","I don't know what critics have seen but what I saw was an excellent movie, That I enjoyed very much. Was it really long ? yes. Was it boring ? NO, not at all! Oh boy, it feels good to be back in the middle earth! The movie is excellently crafted, I liked the detailed costumes and thought that pacing was good. At places the movie did feel less serious, but it's not LOTR.<br/><br/>Although 3D is still strenuous on the eyes , I felt like High frame rate (HFR) actually helped. I must agree it looked a little awkward at the beginning but few minutes into the movie and I really appreciated the quality of the picture and the smooth movement. It is very new and we are not used to it, so I can understand people that didn't like it however us humans never take change very kindly do we ? So don't be disheartened by the critics this is one of those movies that people and critics have to agree to disagree (I found myself in this situation very often). My suggestion is, if you like fantasy, Watch it, if you have an open mind, watch it! However, if you don't like fantasy then yes it will be too long and it will disappoint you, it is a fantasy movie after all ! <br/><br/>My honest mark is actually a 9, but just to spite critics I gave it a 10 =))"

"mdenney1991","9","5","13","31 December 2012"," A very welcome return to Middle-Earth.
","So it's here, Peter Jackson's very highly anticipated return to Middle- Earth has arrived. Despite nearly entering development hell, with directors duties changing hands before Peter Jackson finally decided to just take it on himself... again. Despite the hype surrounding the film, there were certainly worries, particularly with the decision to split the book into three parts, a book which is much shorter than the more epic 'Lord of the Rings', which needed to be split to cover the scope of the long-thought 'unfilmable' book. Not only has it been split into three films, but the runtime, although not quite as long, is comparable with that of 'Lord of the Rings'. <br/><br/>So how did Peter Jackson deal with this very bloated runtime? In my personal opinion I think he has done a great job. To be fair I have never read the Hobbit myself so while I could sense which scenes had been stretched to their absolute limit, I never felt as though Jackson should have cut much out. For the entire 169 minute runtime I was never bored. From the opening frame I was captivated by the fantastic visuals and Jackson's great storytelling ability. <br/><br/>Another great aspect of the film was the casting. Martin Freeman in particular is absolutely perfect as Bilbo Baggins, not that I ever had my doubts, Martin Freeman is one of the more impressive but under- appreciated actors circling at the moment, and he deserves the spotlight. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, while not quite up to the standard of the 'Lordof the Rings' trilogy, it was never expected to be. Visually*, technically and from a narrative perspective, there won't be many movies that could top 'The Hobbit' in the near future one would think. I would recommend to anyone who even has a passing interest in seeing this film.<br/><br/>*I watched this film in 24fps/2D format as I heard terrible things about th 48fps/3D version. From what I've heard I would recommend you do the same."
"nikkocaplin-927-392530","10","5","13","31 December 2012"," This was a night to remember.
","It's been a long journey to the beginning, but here we are, finally.<br/><br/>I had very high expectations for this film. I had seen everything they had done behind the scenes and everything they invested in the project and it all was breathtakingly big! Even though my expectations were high I was still very conscious about not letting it cloud my true view of the film.<br/><br/>When I sat down in the theatre and the the opening started, as soon as I saw The Shire, I just started smiling and that smile continued through the entire film. Even tears appeared at times.<br/><br/>What Jackson and everyone who worked on the film has done is that they have taken everything we loved about The Lord of the Rings movies and added it to the Hobbit in a fitting way. I also very much loved all the extra sidestories that explain where Gandalf went and everything on the side and it very much helps to introduce Sauron and make him even more the ultimate villain. Tt is clear that The Hobbit film is crafted to be watched before The Lord of the Rings and I really am looking forward to seeing the entire Tolkien - Jackson franchise film after film.<br/><br/>The Actors were fantastic. At first I thought they seemed a bit too.. foolish.. if you can say so and wondered if they would stay that way through the entire film. But as soon as danger approached, they became as serious as dwarfs can be. The fact that they go so naturally from foolish jokers to serious warriors really helped accepting the characters even more, and too me, that is exactly who the characters are.<br/><br/>Bilbo is amazing. I have not seen anything complaining about Martin Freeman as Bilbo and I do with every little stray of sense understand that. He is perfect! He has that natural humour that is just there and is funny in it's very own way when the situation is appropriate and when it's not, then the humour turns into seriousness, and it just seems so natural.<br/><br/>Radagast is exactly as I imagined him and maybe even better, and it pleased me so to be able to see him on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Gandalf is perfect and without a doubt the Gandalf you remember, only a tiny bit grumpier, which is how it should be, as he isn't exactly the same he was in The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>There is also a return of another major character who you may not expect too see, and there is not a single moment when you don't love seeing that character on screen.<br/><br/>When I first saw The Hobbit in the theatre, I saw it in 2D 24fps. The reason for that was that I wanted my first expression of the film to be something I knew I would enjoy, rather than experimenting with different way of watching film. I loved the 2D 24fps.<br/><br/>I then watched it in 3D 48fps. I have to say it was better than I expected and was definitely watchable, although it was not preferable. One of the problems were the fact that watching it in 48fps as well as 3D can soon become too much and suddenly I don't know what I'm watching. Also the image is very very clear. In fact, it's too clear. It was easy to see the difference from real light and artificial light. Also the rain looked like it was well placed rainmakers. I did not however ever feel like it was on a set. The nature images were fantastic in 48fps! Also, the feeling wasn't right. For example, the music seemed too old-fashioned compared to the clarity of images. It's hard to explain but it felt like I was watching the movie while listening to some music separately.<br/><br/>The 48 fps 3D was nothing to me and I am very disappointed with the fact that it became the version with the most focus. Because of that, I was forced to watch the 24fps version on a much smaller screen in a much smaller hall, as the 48fps version was shown in the big hall.<br/><br/>I'm sure 48fps works for some people, but it just didn't work for me. I love watching movies in 24fps because that gives me the movie experience. Watching 48fps doesn't feel like I'm watching a movie to me. <br/><br/>It's hard not to talk about everything in the film as I want to discuss the entire film, but I will just say one thing; I am different from everyone else. My views and opinions may not share how you look at it. That's why you can not fully trust any review as the only person who can actually review the film for you, is yourself.<br/><br/>That's why I say go see the film and see what you think. One thing is for sure though, it is good to be back in Middle Earth. I've missed it so."
"erik-esh","4","5","13","28 December 2012"," Not what you want for a 3-hour movie!
","What a disappointment! The scenes were much too drawn out and long. Especially the opening scene with the dinner. That was only good for a nap. There were humorous elements and most were childish which didn't give the movie a serious feeling (overall). <br/><br/>The only really good scene was with Gollum. <br/><br/>Finally, most of the characters weren't that likable and that is unusual given the long scenes that should have developed characters; perhaps because there were so many. <br/><br/>Anyway, it is one of those movies you have to see, I guess. And I'll watch the upcoming ones and hope they are better."
"JSilk1993","9","5","13","28 December 2012"," My Review - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
","I entered the screening of this film with anticipation but underlying tones of dread. After hearing so many negative things about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I was sceptical as to whether I'd like it - let alone enjoy it.<br/><br/>However, this is quite easily my favourite film of the year and, though I can comprehend the reasons people have criticised the film, the sheer magnetism of the characters and a beautifully crafted piece of cinema has eclipsed any flaws in my eyes.<br/><br/>Firstly, I cannot list enough positive aspects of this film. There's a strong feeling of nostalgia for fans and a sense of scale that The Lord of the Rings achieved across its trilogy. By accompanying a great story and setting with magnificent acting, even the characters who are unlike their book-written counterparts are mesmerising at times. The effects are top notch, with 3D being used to immerse and create a depth to the film that's rarely seen in any other, and the innovative use of 48fps compared to the 24fps screening was something I consider a step forward.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie is not without what some may regard as flaws. This is a long film, a lot of it may feel drawn out to some people. Unfortunately, I cannot agree as I enjoyed every moment of this film - even as far as the shots of characters travelling from place to place. This film just feels like an adventure and Peter Jackson has created nothing short of a modern-day masterpiece - in my opinion.<br/><br/>As for any complaints about technological advancement in High Frame Rate - I have no quarrels whatsoever. Changing what we see may upset some people, but I personally congratulate Peter Jackson on an amazing film, incredible effects, brilliant storytelling and directing that is not comparable to anyone else. I would give it 10/10 if it weren't for the fact that I wish the film were more beloved and that this probably could've been achieved if a few things were different.<br/><br/>9/10 10/10 (personal rating)"
"BlairMcLovin","7","5","13","27 December 2012"," An enjoyable, warbling and bloated return to middle earth
","(reviewed from a 24 fps 2D screening) Some things are pretty indisputable about the Hobbit: the story has been stretched (for the sake of Commerce) to the point of breaking and for a pretty lean novel, it feels bloated and tangential. But for the most part I quite enjoyed this return to middle earth, admittedly from a lot of LOTR nostalgia.<br/><br/>When the Hobbit works it works because of Peter Jackson's sure grasp of how he wants to present middle earth and it's characters. Visually the film looks amazing and the use of New Zealand as a stand in for middle earth is once again fantastic. The action is staged brilliantly and I'd go so far as to say Jackson should be mentioned alongside Scorsese when speaking in terms of camera movement. Also the great cast and memorable characters ensures there's usually something compelling about any given dialogue scene.<br/><br/>Where the Hobbit doesn't work is where it feels so intent on elongating the material to add unnecessary elements and incorporate material from Tolkien's The Simarillion, which amount to making the film feel episodic. There were moments when we'd return to Bilbo and I'd forget he was even in the film (this cannot be wholly contributed to my early onset Alzheimers) and scenes that went on for 5 or so minutes but could have been expressed in a few simple lines of dialogue (the dwarfs eating Bilbo's food was pretty unbearable).<br/><br/>But I cannot deny that I relished the opportunity to revisit middle earth and although my opinion of the film will probably diminish in subsequent viewings, watching orcs get beheaded is my definition of entertainment."
"kyle-domination","8","5","13","27 December 2012"," A great and worthy return to Middle-Earth.
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is very impressive in terms of storytelling, action, VFX, cinematography and many more. It's a great film.<br/><br/>The first time I watched The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (about 6 years ago), I decided it was the best movie I had ever seen. It was a pure masterpiece and it was a film you can watch over and over again without getting bored or sick of it. The Hobbit was not as good as the original LOTR but it sure is a damn good film.<br/><br/>The Hobbit takes place before the events of LOTR and tells the story of Frodo's guardian, Bilbo Baggins. He meets Gandalf, the ultimate badass wizard, who asks him to go on an adventure with a group of hilarious but brave dwarfs to take back the dwarfs' homeland. Bilbo is introduced very effectively and you feel straight back in Middle Earth. It really is great.<br/><br/>The acting in The Hobbit is fantastic and the highlight of the film is definitely the dwarfs. Absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>One thing that let me down about The Hobbit was that it felt rushed. For me, it seemed that Peter Jackson had little time because most of the orcs were CG. It let me down because there wasn't a lot of weapons made by Weta Workshop and Peter disappointed me. That was why I rated it an 8.<br/><br/>Everything else in the film was spot on. The set decoration was brilliant and the company did a great job at making this a magical world of brilliance. The cinematography was impressive, smooth and satisfying. Music was again a great score composed by mastermind Howard Shore, who also did the music for LOTR. The script was very well adapted by Peter and co.<br/><br/>So yeah. A great and worthy return to Middle-Earth that completely satisfies you. <br/><br/>Brilliant film. 8/10"
"jlgeddiejd","8","5","13","26 December 2012"," ""The Hobbit"" is still a fun movie.
","One of the great literary works of the 20th century – largely considered the forerunner of the entire fantasy genre – received its first live action screen adaptation this past week. And like most adaptations, it delighted some and left other die-hard purists disappointed. <br/><br/>Stepping away from the strength of the adaptation, ""The Hobbit"" is still a fun movie and Martin Freeman easily slides into the hairy Hobbit-feet of the tiny adventurer drawn from his comfortable home into a world larger than he expected. <br/><br/>With the original work written before ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the movie created after the film series, there is a little bit of confusion and needless references back and forth.<br/><br/>Fans of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy will likely enjoy themselves with ""The Hobbit."" While it doesn't quite capture the same magic as the original trilogy, it does present all of the same building blocks that appealed to audiences the first time around. <br/><br/>The problems with the movie stem from some unnecessary additions from Tolkein's other works and an attempt to add the high fantasy and adventure elements of ""Lord of the Rings"" to this earlier work – which has an innately simpler and gentler tone. From a literary perspective ""The Hobbit"" is a fairy tale and ""Lord of the Rings"" is high fantasy. <br/><br/>Jackson's additions to the script work in some places, but they often serve simply to slow down the pace of the story and distract from the human story going on with dwarfs and hobbits. <br/><br/>Like many, ""The Hobbit"" has a special place in my heart stemming from grade school-aged readings around the breakfast table. And while my personal preference is for the book, finally having a decent movie version of this childhood favorite adds a level of nostalgia to what is already a strong film."
"majorparkhurst","8","5","13","26 December 2012"," Do not listen to the critics on this one..... Go see it!
","Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I'm, in general, a sucker for critics' reviews. I'm like that friend of yours who refuses to see a movie at the theater unless it has a minimum of a 70% rating on rottentomatoes or metacritic. Well, I'm glad I wasn't overly beholden to this rule for The Hobbit. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed my viewing experience from start to finish. I was in a small town whose only theater offered it in 3d but not the high frame rate version, so I can't really comment on that. However, the movie looked great. Yes, CGI was abundant but I didn't feel that it distracted from the overall feel of the movie. After all, it is a fantasy-based movie, so I believe one must give some leeway for the lack of realism. Also, while some may argue that the plot was thin, you must consider that we have only seen 1/3 of the whole story, as this three part-er is based on a sole book. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I was highly pleased with part one of The Hobbit. It may not have risen to the greatness of the LOTR trilogy, but it still met or exceeded my expectations, especially in-lieu of many of the critics' reviews out there."
"badboycore","8","5","13","26 December 2012"," A good, enjoyable film
","I've rated this film a 8 as it is no where near as good as the LOTR series which i rated 9/10.<br/><br/>I'd just like to point out as with the LOTR, I have never read The Hobbit book before I've seen the film. <br/><br/>If you liked LOTR then you will love this. It is very lighthearted and although the first 45 minutes does drag it is entertaining to watch. The opening scenes with Frodo and old Bilbo are an excellent touch that connects it with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' film. I've read people complaining that this film cant decide if its LOTR or The Hobbit but i fail to see how. All i can see is Peter Jackson trying to connect The Hobbit with the LOTR which works.<br/><br/>I went to see this in bog standard 2D 24fps and even on the standard format the visuals are breathtaking so I cant imaging what they'll look like on 48fps. Middle Earth looks AMAZING! <br/><br/>I don't understand why this film has been panned as much as it has by critics. If you just go to see the film as a movie goer and forget the history of the books etc then you will love this film. The action scenes are amazing and so are the characters. Gandalf is a boss man in this film though, he really shines. Great to see a 91 year old Christopher Lee back for a brief moment too.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that the main 'baddy' of the film is a dragon :/ but will just have to wait a year to see how Peter Jackson has done it.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film"
"petern362","8","5","13","24 December 2012"," Brilliant but too much padding out
","The first thing I must say about film makers doing classic works like this, is that you stick to the storyline. Peter Jackson has run roughshod over this by adding characters that were never in the book. Azog the Pale Orc, Saruman, Lady Galadriel and Radagast the Brown were never in the book. If all these characters had been left out it would have reduced the running time by about ½hr. The three trolls did not meet their demise in the way shown. The original way would have been funnier.<br/><br/>That said I thoroughly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the next one. For those people who have never read the book this film is a total delight. for those who have you will be scratching your heads at all the new characters."
"NickMullins","7","5","13","22 December 2012"," Great! Why the hate?
","I am a huge fan of Tolkien, particularly his Lord of the Rings series, and thought that the three movies made in the early 2000's were amazing. I went to the Hobbit expecting to be a little less amazed, I have never been MORE wrong.<br/><br/>Once again Peter Jackson nails the creativity and originality of Tolkiens great master piece. From the cast to the special effects to the well placed humor, I will definitely be seeing this again.<br/><br/>The tale of Bilbo Baggins a prequel to the great adventures of Frodo Baggins, and even better! The overall tone, however, is completely different from that of the early 2000's films, The Hobbit seems more meant for ALL audiences, unlike the dark foreboding of the other three before it. Peter Jackson could not of chosen a better actor for Bilbo than Martin Freeman, who seems born for the role, he balances out the hobbits character perfectly, showing that even someone so small and scared can be brave and big when put to the test. It is more than worth the money."
"ankuruk","10","5","13","22 December 2012"," Good stand alone film, but falls short of the LOTR trilogy
","The dilemma of delivering movies of baronial proportions such as the Lord of The Rings trilogy is that the makers can seldom revivify their own brilliance. The same is the case with The Hobbit. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, pacy, crisp. Cinematography is at par with the trilogy's predecessor and the 3D effects are an added incentive. However one is left desiring for more due to the absence of a pivotal character such as Aragorn. However given the fact that the book, The Hobbit itself is not as grandiose as the Lord of The Rings, Peter Jackson deserves a good deal of praise for his work. On the other hand, if you're one of the minority who are yet to witness the LOTR trilogy, this movie would be nothing short off breathtaking. The revolutionary 48 RED Epic digital cameras don't disappoint as well. Disregard all those skewed reviews which downplay the cinematography of the film. Martin Freeman just fits perfectly into the character of Bilbo and Ian McKellen is the best of the lot. His personification of Gandalf is as fluid and natural as ever. The only central character that falls behind is that of Thorin portrayed by Richard Armitage. Jackson should have dedicated more screen time, but then again we might get to know him better in the following sequels. Had this been released before the Lord of The Rings trilogy, the film would have received better appreciation. I've been to the theaters twice to see this film and trust me it gets better with each viewing. Probably another show and I might bump it to a 9!!!"

","The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey directed by Peter Jackson. The team of 17 Oscars of ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" is back with another trilogy. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is by far the greatest adventure story put together on screen.<br/><br/>The movie starts with detailing of Bilbo – the hobbit (Martin Freeman) who is living a simple life with his book and his food. A Long bearded wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) recruit him for an adventure with a company of thirteen dwarfs led by the legendary warrior (Richard Armitage).<br/><br/>The Excitement starts when the adventure begin with Thirteen group of people led by Thorin. There are many scenes and many more creatures where you can not imagine what you seen on the big screen. But, Peter Jackson knows how to shoot those scenes.<br/><br/>The scene that involves the mountains turns into life and fighting with each other is one of the best scene in the movie. Another one when Gollum (Andy Serkis) plays a riddle game with the Hobbit.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Martin Freeman as Bilbo is perfect in his role. The brave Thorin played by Richard Armitage is superb and Gollum in his small role played by Andy Serkis is amazing to watch specially in riddle game scene.<br/><br/>For the first time the film was shot at 48 FPS, I've seen in normal 24FPS in 3D as one of the best 3D yet.<br/><br/>So, In this era of Special Effects, These filmmakers are always amaze me with their imagination and the presentation.

"elliott78212","8","5","13","17 December 2012"," Eagles Soar, Dwarfs Sing, and Peter Jackson has the one Ring
","I will start with the bad, many reviews have discussed this at length, in truth the beginning could have used a bit of tightening, however when the Dwarfs began to sing the folk songs of old, I grinned from ear to ear yes its in the books. Peter Jackson embraces the technological changes since he first lensed the ring Trilogy and lets be honest when he made them back in 2000-2001 they were state of the art of film technology and so to is the Unexpected Journey. He also creates links from the Hobbit to the Ring Trilogy something I really did like after all it is a prequel to the Movies and while no movie is ever as in depth as the book their are strong reasons to create these histories of the characters, in fact Tolkien did much the same writing other tales, along with various notes his son published later and Tolkien himself referred to as his Legendarium. I also think its important to remind ourselves this story was originally published in 1936, with the Ring Trilogy published 1954-55. Whats astonishing to me is how well Peter Jackson relates to these stories along with his creative writing team Fran Walsh and Phillipe Boyens, its nearly impossible to imagine any other team bringing these books to the screen. What I so loved in this first installment was the things I found missing in the original three movies and thats the animals the over-sized rabbits, the spiders, the Eagles I actually teared up seeing them it was as if someone had peered into my imagination and stolen my vision. I will close with the good, CGI was done well don't listen to the haters, Gollum is wicked, visually stunning presentation, exciting and well paced 2nd half of the movie were it not for the pacing in the first 40 minutes I might have given it a 10 but I deducted for it, the acting was good and eventually Bilbo Baggins Lives this first installment is about Courage. Go See it one tiny side note haha I played Smaug in the play many years ago in high school."
"richard-varis","10","5","13","17 December 2012"," The best movie in years.
","This movie was everything and beyond what I had expected. I was actually a little afraid that I would have so high expectations on this movie, that I would find it to fall short. But the end result was the total opposite. Everything, the story, the execution and the actors are hitting the spot trough out the whole movie. <br/><br/>The movie moves in a logical order, not too fast nor too slow. And it had an surprising amount of steady action trough out the movie. And for those that have not read the books, it will give you even more understanding to the story behind the characters. And as usual, the end of the movie could not have made better. But as I do not want to spoil it for anyone, I wont tell anything more in detail.<br/><br/>However, I watched this movie in 3D, doing that was an honest mistake, I didn't check the details of the viewing before I booked the ticket. And as always I find 3D to kill the movie's beauty. I am more than convinced that the 3D actually took away much of the exceptional cinematics in this movie. And hence I will go back again, to see what I had been waiting for. So a warning from me, do not watch it in 3D. Especially if you also enjoy lovely cinematics and the art of a well filmed movie. The 3D distorts allot and sometimes made the movie feel more real than it should for being a fantasy movie."

","If you love Lord of the Rings then you will love this...some have said the film is too long but i say : if the idea of being able to spend three thrilling hours in professor Tolkien's world fires your imagination then don't hesitate in seeing this movie. The film is rich, packed with detail (even better looking than LOTR), the characters are well realised and expanded slightly from the book..scenes and events from the book have also been fleshed out (but don,t worry Peter Jackson has done a brilliant job in bringing the extra material that Tolkien had written after the hobbit and incorporating it into this movie) Absolutely Brilliant !!"
"thadeus_anand","9","5","13","17 December 2012"," An Expected Journey
","Warning: This is not a review in its truest sense.<br/><br/>Anyone that looks forward to the movie 'The Hobbit' does so due to one of two reasons - he/she either loved 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy so much, or because he/she loved the book so much. But I safely assume fans of the book must have watched the trilogy already. Those who just woke up from a eleven year old coma, and have no idea which trilogy I am talking about, can stay away from this review, as I deem you unworthy.<br/><br/>I won't give away much of the plot, so read ahead without worrying about spoilers.<br/><br/>The movie starts at the Shire that we all love (and wish we lived there). Peter Jackson knows how to cash in on our nostalgia (so does Howard Shore, we'll talk about that later). The story begins with Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins, yet again preparing for Bilbo's 111th birthday. But Frodo makes the cameo appearance only to garner those loud whistles and cheers from the audience, because we are quickly thrown back in time by 60 years. Gandalf the Grey pays a visit to young Bilbo's hobbit hole at Bag End, and so do a merry bunch of dwarfs. Before Bilbo can realize, his food and wine stock is devoured and depleted, and he is part of an adventure he is unprepared for.<br/><br/>That adventure takes them (and us) through so many familiar and unfamiliar territories. We see many familiar faces - Lady Galadriel, Lord Elrond, Saruman the White, and the adorable Gollum (this time the whistles and cheers were louder). We also visit Rivendell (another place that we wished we lived in). Little events that got mentioned in the LOTR trilogy unfold before our eyes, inspiring awe at the wizardry of a certain Tolkien.<br/><br/>Bilbo always seemed an insignificant character in the LOTR. But here, we immediately fall in love with the charisma of his innocence, his body language, his mild stupidity, and his courage (oh yes, even Gandalf says he draws courage from him). He does possess a lot of fear, but that's exactly why his courage is remarkable when he overcomes his fear.<br/><br/>Those who are unfamiliar with the book will be overwhelmed by the number of dwarf characters in the movie, but soon you will be familiar with them all (Thorin, Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin (Gimli's father, if you know who Gimli is), Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur). Thorin deserves special mention here, as his presence is so kingly, other dwarfs get dwarfed in his presence (pardon the pun).<br/><br/>We have seen Gollum in three movies already, hating it, pitying it and loving it. It is the same Gollum that we see here, but it still manages to make our jaws drop with its matchless expressions. Heck, some may even consider killing their dog and replacing it with Gollum as their new pet/companion. But make no mistake, it is equally menacing, manages to kill a goblin with ease, and is not so forgiving when a hobbit rids it of its most precious property. <br/><br/>We also encounter new characters - Radagast the Brown, a nature loving wizard, Azog, a pale and baleful Orc, and the Great Goblin, who deserves the adjective only due to his size. Then there is the Necromancer, and then there is Smaug.<br/><br/>Before the end of the movie, we already care for the fellowship and their quest, and look forward to the next part, and that is the director's triumph.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the visual grandeur of the movie. In a period where every movie comes out in 3D, this one really stands out. It never overuses the effects, but middle earth looks astounding in 3D, and at times it throws a few surprises at you, making you smile. The drooling Wargs look a lot more menacing when they stretch their heads out of the screen towards you. Birds and butterflies flutter all over the theater. The sweeping visuals of a goblin infested mountain can never look better even if you happen to be captured by those goblins and taken there. To say it short, this movie looks even better than LOTR, and that's saying a lot. Every frame of this movie can be used as a wallpaper for your computer/tablet/phone.<br/><br/>Dolby ATMOS - When the stone giants were fighting, the entire theater was rumbling so much, I was afraid the multiplex might suffer a structural collapse at any time. When Gollum was throwing its riddles, the riddles were coming in at us from all directions. As a lover of sound, I truly enjoyed the experience, and will pay yet again to experience it again.<br/><br/>Howard Shore is another reason why the LOTR trilogy is so loved by the fans. Here he mesmerizes us again, in spite of reusing some of the old themes for the sake of nostalgia. The song of the dwarfs is my hot favorite now (it's blasting through my speakers even as I am composing my review at 12:45 am). He also introduces some new themes that we will get more familiar with as the next two parts of this trilogy are released over the next two years (I hate the commercial reasons for such a long gap already). As for me, I will be quite familiar within a week, as I will watch this movie again and again, and have also purchased the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The movie is quite long, running dangerously close to three hours. The more the merrier I say. I already await the extended Blu-ray edition of the movie, which I know will add at least another 30 minutes of middle earth viewing for me. When I went to this movie, I did not go looking for flaws. I am a fan, not a critic. So what else did you expect from my 'review', apart from words of praise?"
"en-213-762617","10","5","13","17 December 2012"," ""The Hobbit"" is easily the best movie of the year
","Peter Jackson has done it again, with an utterly brilliant adaption of the first third of the classic novel ""The Hobbit"", augmented for the better with material from the Appendix of ""Return Of The King."" Ignore the naysayers who say the movie is too slow (it's not), technically deficient (it has some of the best special effects and production design ever put to film) and lacks emotional punch (try to keep dry eyed during the dwarf ""hug"" at the end of the movie). The movie is as close to perfect as possible. It starts exactly the way it should with an older Bilbo talking to Frodo just before the start of ""Fellowship Of The Ring"", which includes an utterly fantastic flashback sequence involving the destruction of the Dwarven kingdom of Erabor by the dragon Smaug. There is another flashback to a battle between dwarfs and Orcs before the Mines Of Moria that is equally stunning. The sequence involving the arrival of Gandalf and the dwarfs could not have been handled any better, as the songs sung and humor are not overdone and are just right. After that, things pick up and the movie concludes with a breathtaking one hour of straight action sequences, all brilliantly rendered. The look of the movie is beyond amazing, consistent with, but much better than the look of the ""Lord Of The Rings"" movies. The 3D draws you in and makes you part of Middle Earth. Unless you just can't stand 3D, go see it in 3D. The acting is all first rate. New cast members Martin Freeman as the younger Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage (in full bad ass mode) as the leader of the dwarfs Thorin, are both spectacular. Ian McKellen is outstanding again as Gandalf, and there are welcome cameos from Cate Blanchette as the Lady Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Lord Elrond , Christopher Lee as Saruman and Andy Serkis as Gollum as well. Indeed, the only negative comment I have involves the wizard Radacast, as he is a bit over the top and is played as if he wandered in from a ""Narnia"" movie by Sylvester McCoy. That aside, the special effects, production design, music and cinematography are some of the best ever put to film. The movie ends with a literal cliffhanger, and I for one can't wait for ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" next December. Is it better than any of the ""Lord Of The Rings"" movies? No, but it's a very close call. All hail Peter Jackson."
"engagedrecords","10","5","13","17 December 2012"," One for the ages!
","At first I didn't know that Jackson was filming three movies. I was under the impression that it was just one film. Now that I know two more movies are on their way, I must say that this is a masterpiece of film, one for the ages! If you have not seen this movie and are a Tolkien fan I highly recommend that you go and see The Hobbit. I really enjoyed the exchange between Bilbo and Gollum. That scene stole the movie, and it is my belief that Andy Sirkus deserves an award for his performance. The meeting at Rivendell between Elrond, Saruman, Gandalf and Lady Gladriel was a fantastic edition to the story and helps build the tension for the LOTR. Overall I was so pleased and overwhelmed that I am beside myself with expectation for the next two movies. ""The Desolation of Smaug"", that should be exciting. ""There and Back Again"", to finally see The Battle of the Five Armies, I am teeming. Thank you Peter for your continued commitment to Tolkien and his legacy."
"robxenotech","8","5","13","15 December 2012"," Wow - Peter and co have done it again!
","Simply put- this movie is near perfect. From the gorgeous opening sequence and stunning vistas, to Rivendell, plains and everywhere else it is almost pitch perfect.<br/><br/>First of all - 48fps - why has this never been done before, seriously? It worked so well in this movie that at times you get so drawn in, you feel part of the crew. It takes at least half an hour to get used to, and by that time the company are leaving Hobbiton. Very impressed with this choice.<br/><br/>Acting is great from everyone with some dwarfs who have very little screen time, can be a little shabby at times. Ian Mckellen, Martin Freeman really shine.<br/><br/>The use of CGI was very high, with most things being computer generated, but that being said you couldn't tell real from cg at times. But, the frequent use of cgi orcs can be a little annoying as I much preferred the practical ones used in LOTR. But sure enough the visuals are gorgeous, and really draw you into the movie. Gollum, is incredible and looks so realistic in some shots. The power of technology really shows through here.<br/><br/>The bad: I found it slow to start, with some dialog being unnecessary. A little trim here and there wouldn't do much harm. The overuse of CGI on orcs can, as I said earlier, be a little distracting but nothing devastating. The little Wilhelm scream uttered by one of the orcs as it falls was completely unnecessary and in fact downright annoying - what is it with directors wanting to use this sound? Finally, the end scene with the Eagles with have you with shivers up your back and your gob on the floor - truly stunning.<br/><br/>Some little improvements to this movie would have done wonders, but I cannot wait for the next one!"
"kiani-francis","10","6","17","3 January 2013"," One Does Not Simply Dislike this film
","After many critics gave this film a negative review for several reasons, I decided to see it for myself. I watched it and discovered the criticisms were a mixture of ignorance and pettiness. 1. Possibly the most controversial element of this film is the 48fps. If you don't like the 48fps, the solution is simple: see it in 24fps! The majority of cinemas show the film in 24fps anyway, so I really don't see what the fuss is about. 2.It's not as great as LOTR. Well, what were the critics expecting? A film based on the writer's first published book that is aimed at children and is only about 300 pages long to be the same as an over 1000 page action book for adults? Seriously, it helps if the book is read first. i trust the critics are capable of reading a children's book? 3.It's more comedic that LOTR, giving it a less serious atmosphere. As mentioned above, it is based on a children's book. 4. It is too long. I did not feel like this was true at all. The reason why the film's length was increased from the original book is that it needs to explain the background events using Tolkien's other works. And the length of the film spent in the shire and hobbiton is about the same as in FOTR. In short, if you are looking for a fun, exciting fantasy adventure film, then watch this film!"
"jdkraus","9","6","17","24 December 2012"," Peter Jackson has brought us back the magical world of Middle Earth and it is still as entertaining, fantastic, and magical ever
","After seeing the ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" back in December 2003, I could not help but wonder when Peter Jackson was going to make ""The Hobbit."" Sitting in my theater seat yesterday afternoon, with dozens of other patrons, I found myself with all smiles through Jackson's release of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" <br/><br/>Many things happen in the book, and it is wise on Jackson's part to split it up into multiple films. This movie ties in important events that lead up to ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"" incorporates parts of Tolkien's fifth ""The Simallarion,"" and displays different perspectives of the world Middle-Earth. No doubt, much of this may come off as needless padding so to make the film longer and expand the novel into three films. Nevertheless, all of these additions help carry the film's plot along; it helps rather than hinders the story. <br/><br/>Similar faces return the screen, such as Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and Chistopher Lee as Saruman. In addition, there are many new faces. Michael Freeman plays a younger Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage is the Dwarven king Thorin. While McKellan, Weaving, Blanchett, and Lee simply reprise their roles, the new members to the Middle Earth world give us characters we care for. Freeman plays Bilbo to the tee—an arrogant, reluctant protagonist who at first seems wrapped up in his little hole in the ground, but becomes a small fella we admire and watch as he triumphs over seemingly impossible odds. Armitage appears a little distant in his character, but this grows apparent as the film's plot progresses, and with good reason. The other actors do a fine job as bringing the novel's characters to life, especially Sylvester McCoy as the crazed, mushroom-eating wizard Radagast the Brown. <br/><br/>What impressed me the most about ""The Hobbit"" is that Peter Jackson has brought us back to the visually mesmerizing world of Middle-Earth. This is his world, and I am glad that he is in the director's seat instead of Guillermo del Toro. Jackson has that strong attention to detail, which makes him such a great director. And when he directs, he is never at arm's length with his subjects or methods of storytelling. He makes it his goal to make the viewers appreciate the wonders of this fantasy world he has presented to us on the big screen. In other words, when I watch this movie, I am not busy paying attention to the cinematography, the set pieces, the costumes, the make up, or even the effects and acting—I am focused on being sucked into the marvels of imagination. A movie is not just a movie; it is a flawless form of escapism. That is what I love about ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" and director Peter Jackson. No other filmmaker could do this with Tolkien's world. <br/><br/>If I had to make one criticism about this film, it would be the CGI. While the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" was abundant in this department, it did not overuse it. The fight scenes were choreographed with actors in make-up and costumes. However, in ""The Hobbit,"" all of the monsters are computer-generated. While this works in some places, it turns other scenes into a cartoon rather than a realistic fantasy. This may have been done as a means for the film to be converted into 3D, but it sacrifices the movie's look. Even so, I refuse to give ""The Hobbit"" a lower score over this discrepancy. <br/><br/>This movie is among the best in the fun, entertaining, and fantasy arena. I hope it earns many accolades in the technical department. 10/10"
"manasakb","5","6","17","23 December 2012"," Decent entertainment, but does not quite live up to the hype
","After perceiving all these mixed critical views on the movie, I simply had to see the movie myself to investigate the fuzz(3D, upgraded fps). <br/><br/>First, I want to compliment the positive aspects of the movie. The technology is state of the art, I give credits to mister Jackson attempting this technology. Consequently, the movie is breathtaking at times, with fantastic scenery and great depth in details in the major fighting scenes. Also great is Gollum, definitely the highlight in this movie for my part. His portrayal and expression is simply marvelous, perhaps enhanced with the higher frame rate. And finally, the trek itself is interesting, though not as compulsive as LOTR at all. Funny that Elrond actually seems older in this movie though (!!).<br/><br/>However, I think most of the points above have a stronger negative force that really draws the movie down (except Gollum, who is still phenomenal). The new technology makes the movie at certain points look like a cheap soap opera/theatrical play. The effect of these 'comical reliefs' are enhanced by the very long storytelling of the movie, where the trek itself doesn't start before 30 mins at least. I find it courageous that songs are included, which I found to be very interesting in the book, but much less interesting in the movie. Also, the landscape and such does resemble some sort of nature documentaries. I really did not like the fact that Jackson extended the book onto 3 parts (x 3 hours each?), which I think kinda disrupts the flow of the storytelling and plot. Considering the fact that I paid 20 euros to see just one movie, i will definitely not spend 60 to see the whole trilogy, as the story is simply not compelling enough!<br/><br/>So it only gets 6/10 from me. It was an interesting experience with the new technological effects, but the movie and story itself is more or less too long and bland. But I guess Hollywood doesn't care, they got a triple cash cow in the financial crisis :)"
"darthmatthew-442-606491","5","6","17","22 December 2012"," Tried to cook an egg and serve it at the same time.
","One of the most anticipated movies of the year, The Hobbit attempts to rekindle the glory of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but falls to mediocrity. Though the same feel was mostly achieved, its reach extended its grasp; simply put, The Hobbit should not have been split into three parts.<br/><br/>As a result of Peter Jackson's decision, The Hobbit suffered from filler-itis, with a large portion of the movie being unneeded back stories and distracting side stories. The backstory of Thorin, the Dwarven leader of the company, was a primitive attempt at characterization and a waste of time, seeing as Thorin's actions and demeanors during the main storyline were enough to give us an idea of the character. The side stories were trying to hard to make The Hobbit a prequel, rather than allowing it to be its own movie. A portion of the movie is devoted to a wizard called Radagast the Brown, who is uncovering a mysteries in the forest of Mirkwood, foreshadowing the return of Sauron in The Fellowship of the Ring. While this was a treat for fans, it was ultimately an annoyance, bouncing back and forth between the story I actually cared about, and a collection of homages that I found slightly amusing. The Hobbit was cooking an egg while trying to serve it at the same time. The result was partially cooked with several raw spots. I found the cooked parts delicious, but gagged on the raw parts.<br/><br/>And the cooked parts were well done. Martin Freeman was perfect as Bilbo, embodying the peaceful, jolly nature of hobbits with the uncertainty that would be expected with a reluctant adventurer. His story and characterization was interesting and I was upset that there was not more focus on him. In fact, Bilbo's interaction with Gollum has to be one of my favorite parts of the series. The brilliant dialogue and acting prowess of Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman had me bawling with laughter. However, these parts were foolishly left in the shadows of lesser characters. It reminded me much of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, in which the majority of the movie was devoted to teenagers ""snogging"" instead of the excellently written interactions between Harry and Dumbledore. But I digress.<br/><br/>In addition to the choppy plot, the side stories, confused the theme. Was this supposed to be dark, jolly, in between? It jumped from the dark back story of Thorin, to the awkwardly jolly side story of Radagast the Brown, and then back to the mostly serious main narrative. It was like going through puberty then jumping back and forth.<br/><br/>The Hobbit lacked much of the charm and wonder of the Lord of the Rings. Its lack of focus cost the movie dearly. Though the Lord of the Rings trilogy contained many character side stories, none of them felt like they were getting special treatment, unlike in the Hobbit. They felt united in a common, central idea whereas in The Hobbit, I felt it was for the characters rather than the ideas. And that, is a very effective way to break down a movie into a bedtime story."
"jkb851","10","6","17","21 December 2012"," Ignore the criticism! It's a good movie at heart!
","The Hobbit is more humane and passionate novel aimed at kids. This movie contains those traits, but is certainly not a juvenile film. So ignore what many have said. The CGI in the film is suitable for the tone and is the epitome vision of what this story should be like on the big screen. The movie's driving point, other than the brilliant story is the underlying themes that revolve around Bilbo in the movie. The struggle of being small in a harsh world. We are once again absorbed into this amazing world as we once were in 'The Fellowship Of The Ring', but this being many years before those events Middle Earth isn't so dark. So it's less gritty than lord of the rings, but I prefer this text over Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>The movie starts fairly with an amazing monologue and with plenty of scenes faithful to the lore, especially the scene with the Dwarfs singing. But after that and journey picks up; it's all you could ask for and more.<br/><br/>Packed with an excellent cinematography, soundtrack, acting and a brilliant riddle scene. The acting is nailed by every member of the cast and Martin Freeman is the definitive incarnation of Bilbo Baggins.<br/><br/>I love this movie and I definitely believe it will shine throughout time as a classic story and a perfect beginning to what should be a hopeful trilogy. <br/><br/>Now to the criticism. How can one camera alteration lead to the actual content of the film being worse. The 48fps benefits those viewing it in 3d and those who wish to watch it in 2D will most likely see the 24fps version, which is to be desired by majority.<br/><br/>PS. Their are several links and cameo's that will give most Lord Of The Rings fans goosebumps, especially the tie in with 'Radagast the brown' and the eerie and misfile 'necromancer'."

","I had high expectations, since I am a massive Tolkien fan, and I left the cinema happy. I'm glad that Piter made this movie with ""childish"" humor, since the book is written in a very different way than the LOTR. The scenery is (again) amazing, and in my opinion Andy Serkis gave his best performance ever! However, to someone who doesn't know what this film is about, it would seem that Dwarfs are the main carracters, and Bilbo is left behind. The thing that I most dislike is the scene when Dwarfs sing Far over the misty mountins... That's probably the best theme this year, and it seems it was put in the movie with no care, like: ""Ok, we need to put this in, oh, here's the good spot!"" But it wasn't!

","Wow, where to start?<br/><br/>I guess if you're reading this review, all I'd say is that you should get off your butt and go watch this movie.<br/><br/>My only gripe is one that is not directed at the movie. If any of you read the IGN review, you'll find that it was very inaccurate. They said that the characters were not developed well, whereas they were. Peter Jackson did an excellent job of creating character where there wasn't any to be had in the book. And the dwarfs were far from colorless.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, and yet subtly brought back the Howard Shore Shire theme (which if that doesn't tug at your heart-strings, what will). What I liked was that not all of the dwarfs had distinct character. You'll find that the same is true in reality, with some people contributing to society, and others, well not. Very good movie from start to finish, and when experts paint this movie to be less that expected, don't pay any heed. This is a movie that gives the very Lord of the Rings trilogy a run for its money."

","I hate this movie because it left me wanting more. From beginning, the intense action combined with poetically blended humor put me under an unwavering grip, which didn't left me for days. This movie is like a drug as every second, every minutes just lures you in. Every part in movie is like an age's old wine and when you combine it with astounding dialogues and excellent acting, the effect this movie creates is divine. All I can say is, this was the first movie where I actually swore because I had missed few seconds after interval. I still remember the confrontation with Golem, the amazing last scene where the heroes were saved by those eagles, the Dawren city, the chase scenes etc. etc. And when the end came, Gods I hate Peter Jackson, I was left with wanting more. Overall, this is movie that you can keep on watching without getting bored.

"palermoga","9","6","17","14 December 2012"," Don't Listen to the Critics the Movie was Great
","After reading some of the mainstream critics reviews I was kind of a reluctant to go and watch the Hobbit for fear that I would be disappointed in the same way I was after watching the Dark Knight Rises. Thankfully my concerns as well as the mainstream critics negative reviews proved to have been unfounded. A complaint I keep on hearing from the critics is regarding the pacing of the film. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the pacing. For a three hour long movie not only did it succeed in keeping my attention the entire time but when it ended it didn't feel as if three hours just went by. The pacing of this film can best be compared to an action packed 90 minute movie. The flow was excellent. To give you an example, when I went to watch Breaking Dawn Part 2, I kept looking at my watch to see what time it was because that movie was just dragging on and when that movie ended it felt as if I was in the theater for 8 hours. I enjoyed the action sequences in the Hobbit. Yes, the story is simplistic but that doesn't make the movie bad. The novel is only around 350 pages but that didn't stop it from becoming a literary masterpiece. The one real issue I had with the Hobbit was regarding character development. I like the way that Jackson began introducing Dwalin, Balin, Killi and Filli in the beginning. By doing this I got to know these four characters. Sadly that can't be said for the other 8 members of dwarf company. After Killi and Filli were introduced, Jackson decided to forgo further introductions and just brought the rest of the group into Bilbo's home. The consequence of this action is by the end of the movie I still didn't get to know the other dwarfs which was sad. In fact, for the rest of the movie, the other dwarfs rarely speak with the exception of Ori. Bombur was a funny character but he had maybe 5-6 lines in the whole movie. To me the other dwarfs just felt irrelevant. I am hoping in the next two films, Jackson will take more care and let us get to know the other wonderful characters in this story. Aside from this issue I felt this movie was a masterpiece. In my opinion I feel that the negative critiques from the mainstream critics is more political than anything. Look at the disparity between the critics and the average moviegoers. The critics give the film around a 48% while the average moviegoers (who are the people who actually matter) give the film a 90%. Normally the disparity between the two groups is closers. Check out the reviews for Breaking Dawn Part 2 and you see that the reviews of the critics and the audience is fairly even 54% and 56% respectfully."
"a_tale_of_rock","10","6","17","14 December 2012"," Fantastic movie in every way!
","This is the first review I write and it's for this movie. That means something...<br/><br/>I've read some other reviews first and I just can't understand why some of them are completely against this movie. Some say that everything is bad and boring. I just can't believe that they actually know what they're talking about.<br/><br/>I write this review because everything was just so perfect. This movie held the pressure of the Lord of The Rings Trilogy and yet it rocked! The tone of the hobbit is indeed lighter than LOTR, which is obvious because the hobbit is originally a children's book. Peter Jackson also added some very good jokes here and there. Sometimes when you don't expect it, it happens. I liked that humor very much. It fits with the movie very well.<br/><br/>Many people had doubts when the hobbit became a trilogy. They thought it would be too stretched. Well, I can honestly say that this isn't the case. The pacing of the movie was very good and the time flew by. I never got bored at all. Jackson also added the side story of Gandalf which Tolkien released at the back of the return of the king. He also changed little things that were necessary for the film. I won't spoil it, so you'll just have to watch it for yourself. This is the reason why The Hobbit became a trilogy. It was a good decision. It gives more depth to the whole story, and it links to LOTR.<br/><br/>The visual aspect of the movie is just off the chain. The HFR is superb together with the 3D. The movie is very clear and it really feels like you're in middle-earth. I didn't get dizzy at all and it didn't look like an ordinary TV program as some critics said. You should definitely watch it in HFR 3D.<br/><br/>Last but not least. Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage were born for those roles. Martin plays Bilbo perfect. Out of 7billion people they chose the right guy. He's funny, emotional and heroic when he has to be. The same counts for Thorin. Richard played this character so well that I think many people will choose Thorin as their favorite character of Tolkiens world. Outstanding performances. The rest of the cast is also very good but these 2 were the standouts.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, Fran Walsh, the cast and crew that brought this movie, THANK YOU8<br/><br/>Can't wait for part 2: The Desolation of Smaug."
"mrhorrormovieguy","9","6","17","12 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a blast from start to finish, and will leave you wanting more!
","A curious Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, journeys to the Lonely Mountain with a vigorous group of Dwarfs to reclaim a treasure stolen from them by the dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>I remember the first time I finished reading the book, it was an amazing story with great characters and good fantasy. I've read The Hobbit probably eight times, and it still fascinates me. So, did the movie do the book justice? The answer is: YES!<br/><br/>Before I went to see the movie I decided myself for two things, the first thing was to not see it in 48 fps. I had heard a lot of negative things about it, and I didn't want it to ruin the experience. And second was that I tried to lower my expectations for the film, since many had told me that it was very slow at times and didn't pick up before the last hour of the movie. So was this a good idea? Yeah, I really think it was. <br/><br/>I don't want to talk about the plot, and spoil everything. But what I will do is talk about what I liked and didn't, and also try to make clear why many didn't like this movie that much. I want to start with the actors, because they do a fantastic job! Ian Mckellen, Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage are the ones who steal the show. They are wonderful in their roles, and Armitage as Thorin is some of the best casting I've seen in all year. The rest of the cast is also very good! Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis do their jobs, and the dwarfs are fun to watch. The battle scenes were great, even tough it wasn't in such a huge scale as in Two Towers and Return of the King, but it still was very good! There was a lot of things in the movie that wasn't in the book, which could be a bad thing but it blended in surprisingly well and makes it connect more to Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>Now the thing I wan't to talk about is the complains about the movie's pacing. I was prepared to see some slow scenes, since I was told that the movie did get slow at times. But the problem is that I never noticed those scenes. I was so invested in the world and the characters, that I loved every bit of what was happening. All the nods and references to the Tolkien universe blended in so well, and it didn't make me bored for one second. The way it ties so much into Lord of the Rings, makes the movie some much better. And I can really understand why Peter Jackson is making a third Hobbit film. <br/><br/>Now from what I can see, is that the ''slow'' pacing in the movie is because its an straight adaptation of the book. Every thing in the book is in the movie, and people complain that many of the scenes were unnecessary. So what I have found out is that the people who is going to love this movie, are the people who fell in love with the book. Because obviously many of the critics haven't read the book, so they can't really care much for any memorable moments from the book. <br/><br/>Some of the complaints I have is that when you have 13 dwarfs, its hard to develop them all. Actually Thorin is more developed then any of the other dwarfs, so hopefully we'll get more development to these dwarfs in the sequels, and not just half of them. And even tough it was great to see Elijah Wood back again as Frodo, it was just weird to see him much older then he was in Lord of the Rings, and this is a prequel! So I think they could have done some more job on the makeup maybe.<br/><br/>Anyways, I think that is all I have to say about the movie. I loved it and I can't wait for the next one!"
"biffyclyrolover","9","4","10","5 February 2013"," This is The Hobbit... On Steroids!!!!!
","To be honest, after all the bad things I'd heard said about Unexpected Journey from other LOTR fans, I went in expecting a mess. But, even though I'm a die-hard LOTR fan, I loved this film. I'd even go as far to say it's my favourite of 2012 thus far (But I have yet to see Life of Pi, Zero Dark Thirty, Django Unchained and Lincoln). I came out of the theatre and thought to myself, ""Yeah, that was the Hobbit on Steroids!"" I truly have never seen a children's tale that was so simple adapted into a film for adults this way before. For the LOTR fans, we get to see things that were in the appendixes, such as the battle between the dwarfs and orcs for Moria, Azog (who lives longer than in the actual book and is basically the main villain) and even Saruman before he became evil. So, there are a ton of things to say which I will whittle down into Good and Bad categories, as I usually do.<br/><br/>The Good: Casting decisions. The choice for actors in this is excellent. Of course, Ian McKellan is Gandalf and he will always be Gandalf in my opinion, nothing can top his performance. Martin Freeman was great as Bilbo Baggins and captured the true essence of the character, as at the beginning he is a timid, cowardly Hobbit and towards the end actually saves Thorin's life and displays bouts of bravery, which helps him earn Thorin's trust. Richard Armitage was bad ass as Thorin Oakenshield and I think was ultimately the perfect choice for the character. The rest of the dwarfs are really funny, my favourite ones apart from Thorin being Dwalin, Balin, Fili and Kili. And of course Andy Serkis returns as Gollum. We'll talk about that later.<br/><br/>3D actually works! I went and saw it in 3D with the 48fps. And this is a film that was definitely made to be in 3D, I mean it just looks amazing in 3D. The details on the Eagles feathers, the rocks coming towards you, it's just gorgeous in 3D. This is one instance where I recommend going and seeing it in 3D. The 48fps is also noticeable, as the shots go by even faster than other films and therefore give us a lot more detail on the action.<br/><br/>CGI Gollum. The Gollum scenes are absolutely amazing. Gollum looked awesome for 2002 in Two Towers, but now he has just been refined thanks to technological developments and looks real. There's even a part where he shows his teeth and the teeth are so well animated, I genuinely thought it was a part of the costume.<br/><br/>The ties with the appendixes. This is a gripe a lot of people have with this film and I really don't see why, because it expands and evolves it. The Dwarfs battle outside Moria was just awesome, Thorin vs Azog was so cool to see (although it kind of drifted away from the lore with that one since it was actually Nain who killed Azog in the mines and Azog is still alive in this) and the little references to Bilbo's relatives is quite interesting as well. I thought it breathed even more life into a universe that already had a ton of it. Plus the fortress of Dol Guldur is mentioned which (spoilers) was Sauron's first fortress after he began to come back to Middle Earth.<br/><br/>The music. The music is just awesome. LOTR's music was kick ass but, arguably, the Hobbit's was even more kick ass! Especially the parts where the Dwarfs go into battle, the music really picks up and is so epic. And that Misty Mountains Cold song? That is one of the best original songs I have heard in a film.<br/><br/>The Bad: The comedy can be hit and miss. Let me just say that there is a lot of stupid stuff that goes on with the Dwarfs. For example, Bombur's relationship with food can distract. But some of it was quite funny as well and didn't deviate too far from the main plot.<br/><br/>Radagast the Brown. The only character who I personally thought was a little annoying was Radagast. He's kind of like the Jar Jar Binks of Middle Earth. He does have some cool things about him though, like the bunny sled. But when Saruman talked about his relationship with mushrooms, I think that's when I lost faith with that character. That was the dumbest moment of the entire film.<br/><br/>The CG. The CG is awesome on Gollum but on other things looked too cartoony. For example, I don't remember Orcs and Goblins looking so cute and made for kids and the Goblin King had a testicle for a chin, I'm not kidding. So that can sometimes be a problem.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 9/10 Awesome! When I look back on this film as a whole, I think that this was just amazing. The fact that Jackson actually managed to make 3D work in a film is impressive, the casting is spot on and I can ignore some of the little quirks (but not Radagast, that will never be forgiven). It just misses the top spot of Instant Classic for Radagast, who I think needs to be made a little less weird. But this truly is my favourite film of 2012, even though it's not the best. Awesome!"

","Directed by Peter Jackson. Starring Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage. Written by: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro and J.R.R Tolkien. <br/><br/>"" True courage is not when to take a life. It's when to spare one""<br/><br/>'Bilbo Baggins is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen Dwarfs led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield.'<br/><br/>Peter Jackson did a fantastic job with this film. His direction was great and he controls the story from beginning to end. His cinematography is amazing. As like his earlier trilogy of LOTR, there are plenty of panning crane shots as the characters travel and the camera usage during battle is nothing less than flawless. His efforts with the Gollum scenes were my particular favorites. I was astonished with the reactions I felt during the 'Riddle Game' between Bilbo Baggins and Gollum. Such a simple idea but my heart was pounding throughout. The mannerisms of Gollum, the atmosphere, the fear in Bilbo's eyes and the creeks and sounds from the background made this an excellent display. The CGI was exquisite in this film yet it brings out the only flaw in my opinion. There was more CGI usage than actual sets. That disappointed me. It stole the realism away from the film.<br/><br/>The acting in this picture is excellent. Ian McKellen is once again great as Gandalf the Grey. I particularly enjoy watching McKellen portray the Grey version of Gandalf than the White used in the LOTR trilogy. The make-up and effects used to make the character younger was phenomenal. Another superb performance goes to Richard Armitage portraying Thorin. Through out the film, he is the Dwarf that brings the most discipline and leadership. He wants nothing but to retain his fallen kingdom. He thinks of Bilbo only as useless weight. He barely acknowledges him throughout the journey and has no faith in the hobbit, bringing him down inch by inch. Yet at the end, he shows his true colors. It's a notable transition.<br/><br/>The score in this movie was it's strongest feature. There are many themes used from the LOTR trilogy that fit very nicely in the appropriate scenes. They also created a new sound for this film. Most particularly the Lonely Mountain theme. It fits perfectly in the crane shots used to follow the characters march onward and as the Dwarfs are in battle.<br/><br/>In the end, this motion picture isn't on par with the LOTR trilogy but it's a magnificent film in it's own right. A must see."
"mariak_home","8","4","10","4 February 2013"," another superb quest
","Another showing of the quest, but this one precedes the restoration journeys of The Ring. Here, a much younger Bilbo, played brilliantly by Martin Freeman (so mild, yet so able to evoke emotion), is more or less coerced into undertaking a treacherous mission across mountainous territory in the company of dwarfs, to help restore their kingdom. Some reviewers thought the film overlong, and it does seem so at the beginning, particularly the somewhat protracted night when the dwarfs are encamped in Bilbo's cramped hovel. But as they cross epic landscapes and fall prey to ghastly creatures (the oily Gollum gets an outing too), one cannot help being drawn in to their adventure. The technological and graphic detail is amazing: how do they get unreality to look so really real? Of those of us watching the film, ages 13,19,30,36,66,68 we mostly gave it a thumbs up."
"bmalc","10","4","10","11 January 2013"," Boring...really?
","After hearing so many, well, negative reviews I had almost decided not to check The Hobbit out in the cinemas. Fortunately a few well trusted reviewers said that it was actually pretty awesome. The film, as a whole, was spectacular. Even Radagast wasn't as annoying as I was led to believe. The VFX were amazing (not ground-breaking, but still amazing), the score was epic, the dwarfs were well played individuals (though you don't get to know all of them extremely well), Richard Armitage was so epic as Thorin that I fully respect him as an actor, even after being in BBCs Robin Hood (blah) and Martin Freeman rocks as Bilbo. Ooh, and the ""Riddles in the Dark"" scene was both hilarious and smart. Those who say it is too slow or long obviously haven't read the book. May it's 8.3 rating be everlasting. Go see it."
"chrisbarker344","4","4","10","7 January 2013"," Too long, what have they done to this story?
","Pretty sets - Bilbo's house is brilliant, and who would not want to live there? The biggest problem with this is it is way too long. The joy of the book is that it is a perfectly self contained adventure. The problem here is that there is more detail than needed and it even introduces characters that are not in the book (but conveniently appear in the cast list of LOTR)<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - it's not a bad film, and the effects are first class. I just feel it's being stretched too far - 3 films for this story - you have to be kidding. The whole thing could have been done in one (admittedly long) film. Also watching it in 3d is a waste of money and spoils the film. It is already dark, and 3d glasses actually removes a load of detail. I will not be watching parts 2 & 3 (at the cinema at least)"
"silverdeep","3","4","10","5 January 2013"," Underwhelming
","I've been waiting for The Hobbit ever since the LOTR trilogy. Didn't expect the same type of film, as it's source is a children's book after all, but I did expect to be entertained and enjoy great Middle-earth visuals. I got the latter, but not the former. It's not terrible, but it felt very flat. There are things I could nitpick (like how utterly ridiculous Azog looked or why the voice acting for the Goblin King didn't fit), but my major gripe is probably the dwarfs and Bilbo since the film relies so heavily on them after all.<br/><br/>The way the dwarfs looks and behaves here are so different from how Jackson presented Gimli to us that it's simply too jarring for my taste, and even in itself I'm not so sure it's a change for the better. Neither do I think this main cast have the same charisma as did the one of the LOTRO films. It's not necessarily that they are wrong for their roles, I wouldn't go that far, it' just that they somehow feel subdued. This might change in the coming two films, which I hope. <br/><br/>I'm grateful the film was made and I got to return to Middle-earth once more and I will probably go see the following Hobbit films as well. However, next time with a lot less enthusiasm."
"russellstewarthawkins","9","4","10","4 January 2013"," Excellent for Middle Earth Fans
","Movie Critics don't deserve to watch movies based on JRR Tolkien's literature. They are ignorant movie goers and don't understand the subtleties of the Tolkien universe. <br/><br/>I really don't understand what any or all of the critics expected. Almost every single critic that wrote a review on the Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey goes into pointless ramblings about how long and boring it is. I mean, did these guys even see the extended version of the Lord of the Rings? Its in the same universe as those movies. Seriously, 2 hours and 45 minutes is not that long. And, I don't understand how everyone is let down either. This ISN'T the Lord of the Rings. Don't expect it to be. Its a different story entirely. If you read both the Lord of the Rings, and the Hobbit, you will realize, they are COMPLETELY different styles of stories. However, they are both from the same Tolkien universe. So, for Peter Jackson to have done what he did with the movie, I say bravo. For example... In the books there is about 1 to 2 lines about the fight between the large stone giants in the mountains. How do you make that short in the movie? Impossible. The way that Peter Jackson handled it was extraordinary. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie seems longer as well. Do you want to know why? It is because the plot is not as urgent. It's true. Its not, but that is the way the story was written. Its not the end of the world, its just a journey of one hobbit to a lonely mountain. Secondly, this is one story unlike the Lord of the Rings which is at times 4 or 5 stories going at the same time. So obviously its going to seem a little bit long. Yet, if you see it truly as a journey of a young hobbit to find out who he truly is, then you can see why it might be necessary to elongate it. You can't change quickly and the things that happen to Bilbo on this journey, that were contained in very few sentences in the book must be represented by longer scenes in the movie to fully understand them. Anyone who truly understands JRR Tolkien's literature will understand the subtle or not so subtle differences between these two books and will recognize Peter Jackson for the true genius that he continues to be with this latest installment of the middle earth saga."
"gavinmrt","7","4","10","1 January 2013"," The Hobbit An unexpected disappointment.
","As a standalone movie The Hobbit is a good movie thats why i gave it a 7 but when compared to the LOTR movies it sucks the visuals are fake looking the big orcs and wolves are like cartoons and i watched it in 2D. The problem lies in the fact that Peter Jackson took years and years to plan and film the LOTR trilogy and it was obviously a labour of love for him in contrast The Hobbit seems rushed and the care and respect is not there. The result is not too much of a surprise really as peter Jackson always wanted Guillermo del toro to direct and only took the job when the pans labyrinth director removed himself this was a sure sign that his heart was never in it from the start. That being said i still enjoyed it and i am sure the younger audience who did not live through the build up and hype of the first trilogy will love it as they have nothing to compare it to. Also non film buffs will love it as they will not be fussy about the visuals and pacing of the story but the bottom line is when you create a world so perfect and loyal to the source material you can not then go on to expand on that universe with a lesser product and think no one is going to notice."
"mistabobdobolina","6","4","10","28 December 2012"," Not a Masterpiece for the Ages
","Well. That was certainly... something.<br/><br/>This is a first reaction to the film having just seen it, and I may be moved to revise it later. Right now, though, I'd have to say that having just been through a total onslaught on the senses, I find myself curiously underwhelmed. (It seems important to specify, given the negative responses to the HFR version of this film which may be a side-effect of a misguided technology, *which format* one has seen it in. I'm reviewing the 3D but non-HFR version.) I was willing to give the Hobbit the benefit of the doubt, despite that I had a hard time seeing how one would stretch this story to three films. But it seems to me that the stretch-marks are all too evident, and the sense of wonder -- of seeing a much-loved story come to life -- that the LOTR films reached at their best is all too rare here.<br/><br/>In part there's just a fundamental mismatch in tone between LOTR and the light-hearted children's book being rendered here, such that the project of trying to make this a portentous prequel to the War of the Ring falls flat. As in the LOTR films, there's a great deal of effort spent on trying to bring out the sombre and melancholy tones in Tolkien's Middle Earth; but unlike that trilogy of films at its best, the broad-stroke comedy that's integral to this tale just doesn't work as a result, and nor does much of the heroic posturing that it's counterpointed with.<br/><br/>Jackson's LOTR wasn't entirely without such problems -- especially in The Two Towers, whose dwarf-tossing japes and visual one-liners often seemed out of place -- but it's worse here. Much worse. I could tell that the opening dinner party sequence was meant to be funny, for example... but I had to fight to keep from dozing off during it, and likewise for the dwarfs' encore comedic turn in Rivendell. Material like that seems to undercut the sombreness Jackson tries to bring to the dwarfs' quest, and the weight he tries to add to it with cameos from Saruman and Galadriel, so much that Thorin's stern heroics ultimately fail to convince. In the end, no amount of swelling music and actors looking pensively off into the distance can make this tale feel solid enough for what Jackson is going for -- nor can any amount of slapstick and cute costuming make it feel light-hearted and funny. No matter that the composer recycles virtually every theme used in the LOTR trilogy, no matter that the director furiously padded the story with every bit of Unfinished Tales arcana he could manage (even working in a reference to the Blue Wizards), this just doesn't feel weighty enough to be a prequel or to be a three-film epic.<br/><br/>In a way the LOTR benchmark was so high that the inevitable comparisons may seem unfair: Jackson soared to such heights that now we take those heights for granted. And to be clear, I don't think this is a *bad* film. There are good elements and moments. Freeman brings Bilbo to life very convincingly, the portrayal of Thorin is just as good, the visual effects are as sterling as ever, the original cast do fine (if sometimes seemingly superfluous) work, the riddling scene with Gollum is spot on, Azog's enlarged villain role is reasonably entertaining, the encounter with the mountain trolls is truly fun to watch.<br/><br/>But it's not a great one either. There's just too much padding and ill-fitting material. Radagast played for laughs with a sledge of ""Runcible rabbits"" and birdshit in his hair leaves a rather bad taste in the mouth. The pacing feels off and leaden, especially in the early going. The bulk of the action set-pieces feel like they're covering up a lack of substance with pure bombast (especially an inexplicable and over-the-top literalization of the ""battling giants"" reference in the original book); as usual, where Jackson departs radically from Tolkien's vision and calibration of the action, he goes badly wrong.<br/><br/>In the end, this left me with no desire to go out and see the two films meant to follow it. I had a choice between this and Jack Reacher, and left the theatre feeling pretty sure I chose wrong."
"brent_or","7","4","10","27 December 2012"," 7.5 - Pretty Good Film, Disappointing Adaption of Book
","I'll get this out of the way first: as a faithful adaption of the book, this fails. It misses the spirit of the printed Hobbit, attempting to graft on too many ""epic this!"" Lord of the Rings moments. Also, the battle scenes are way too over the top. Also, etc. That all being said, if you can divorce your mind from the book (or if you've never read said book), it's a pretty good fantasy film.<br/><br/>As usual, Peter Jackson brings the eye-popping production values in terms of breathtaking cinematography and rich prop and set design. The character dialogue is quite good. The casting was well done, especially for the characters of Thorin and Bilbo. Brilliant, those two. Gollum looks better than ever, and his perfectly executed big scene with Bilbo is unquestionably the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>The musical score is familiar and beautiful, but gets overused to hammer home the emotional notes; in some cases it would have been better to just let the music drop out and have the acting convey the mood. The eagles looked rather fake during their first appearance, although they looked much better in the very next scene. The goblin scenes were way overdone; sometimes, being able to create digital characters and sets seems to lead directors into a bit of visual gluttony.<br/><br/>I did not like some of the ""added"" elements, but I have not really all of Tolkein's appendices (which were apparently mined for some of the story-expanding parts), so I can't say much about that. Also, I hate 3D. The film was blurry during camera pans, and the color was distinctly less appealing with the glasses on versus taking them off. All in all though, in spite of my quibbles, I have to admit that the Hobbit is a beautiful, exciting, humorous, epic specimen of a fantasy film. Credit where credit is due; there are many horrible films out there, and this one is pretty good."
"cjgibson918","7","4","10","25 December 2012"," Let down for LOTR nerd
","As a huge LOTR trilogy fan, I set the bar on this movie pretty high to begin with, but it just didn't come close to where anyone should expect. I am not complaining about the story changes that many fans are, but about the production value of the movie itself. The LOTR trilogy had dragons, trolls, goblins and all other manner of creatures that looked spectacular, or at the very least sufficiently real to keep the viewer from loosing interest, but the special effects in The Hobbit were of very poor quality. All of these effects and characters looked very cartoonish and were a huge drag to the movie. One action scene looked like it was pulled straight out of an arcade game (you will know which one I am talking about when you see it). Also, the dwarf's characters were childish and poorly developed, and much of the dwarf acting was 'phoned in'. Don't go to this looking for LOTR. Go expecting LOTR meets Harry Potter meets the second Star Wars trilogy, because that is what you will get. I just hope that if Peter Jackson is picked for the new Star Wars, we will see production like we saw in LOTR and not this movie."
"nichtssagend","7","4","10","18 December 2012"," Action-packed welcome back to the Middle Earth of LOTR
","Peter Jackson continues to balance a faithful adaptation of a revered book with the realities of the movie format. The almost 3 hours fly by quickly and it almost feels like the movie needed a slower pace, but I suppose it has to first and foremost ""entertain"".<br/><br/>The acting is superb and while there are some comical and light-hearted moments, it is never kitschy or childish. I was afraid Bombur was going to turn out to be ridiculously silly, but I was wrong. Gollum is arguably even better than in LOTR and in some scenes surprisingly likable! Martin Freeman is an amazingly convincing hobbit, and Bilbo's relationship with Gandalf is nicely introduced/explained at the beginning.<br/><br/>The New Zealand scenery and sets are as grand and detailed as we are used to from LOTR and the CGI so good that you don't notice it, which in my opinion is the best compliment one could give. The Shire looks wonderful and even more detailed than in LOTR and other locations in both forested and mountainous areas are stunning! <br/><br/>Minor criticisms: 1. The scene with the mountain giants fighting felt a tad unnecessary for the flow of the movie. <br/><br/>2. Some action sequence shots seemed ""made for 3D"". Note: I watched the 2D version.<br/><br/>3. Only because it was unexpected: This movie is *not* for children, even though the book was intended for children. That will perhaps disappoint the parents of kids who read The Hobbit in anticipation of then watching the movie. I would say the minimum appropriate age for The Hobbit would be 13, but every parent has their own opinions on that.<br/><br/>In summary, an extremely well made, entertaining movie, irrespective of whether or not you've read The Hobbit.<br/><br/>PS: My favorite scenes: * The introduction of the dwarfs - well paced, balanced amount of humor. * The game of riddles - Andy Serkis at his best! * The final scenes concluding the confrontation with the Goblins/Wargs (can't be more specific without spoiling it ;-)"

"filmfanjesse","8","4","10","17 December 2012"," A great journey into Middle Earth once again
","This movie has already gotten an extreme amount of negativity towards it and many complaining about this new 48 FPS. Well, guess what? I saw it in 24 FPS with no 3D and it was so, so worth it. Anyways, I'm done with the technical stuff let's get onto the actual review of the film itself. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes place 60 years before the fantastic Lord of the Rings Trilogy although we do have an opening scene that nicely connect this trilogy to the previous one involving an older Bilbo and Frodo that takes place just a little bit before Lord of the Rings starts. Right off the bat, I loved that they seamlessly connected the two trilogies. <br/><br/>The movie then spends the next 30 minutes or so to get Bilbo to be convinced to go on a journey with the dwarfs and Gandalf. Although, this part is a bit slow, I feel like it was a great introduction to the dwarfs and seeing Gandalf again in a film was great. Eventually, Bilbo decides to go on the journey and many things ensue with some great set pieces, action sequences, etc. It's great. Everyone in the cast gives very strong performances especially Martin Freeman and Ian Mckellen. Besides that, the cinematography is just as beautiful as it was in the Lord of the Rings trilogy as well as the music. <br/><br/>My only real complaint of the movie is the pace can be a bit slow. In the Lord of the Rings, those 3 hours for each movies feel like nothing but during this film, I felt like it was a bit too slow. Personally, I think at least 15-20 minutes could have been chopped off in editing and resulted in a better film. They could have just used the 15-20 minutes they cut and added it to the extended edition which we know is inevitable. Otherwise, this was a fantastic journey into Middle Earth once again and I'm eagerly anticipating the next two films."

","It's not like I really wanted to see it, I just was seeing how comparable it was to the The Lord Of The Rings. I had previously seen the other LOTR films in order to gain some knowledge and felt like 'this should be a good film, it's not like it's going to be the worst film. Maybe I should look forward to this, I mean Peter Jackson did really well with the previous films, why should he fail with this one?' It's when you realise that it's a big mistake to overexcite yourself, that it's not the advertising that's hyping it up, it's you. It's because of that that you think it's going to be good. But you always blame it on the director and the studio and anyone else associated with the film because they're the ones distributing it. And you can't help but hype it, as it just looks and feels amazing. It's only afterwards that you then blame yourself for believing that it had any redeeming features.<br/><br/>I felt more than a little disappointed when I walked out of the cinema, as I saw it in IMAX 3D because of the 9 minute preview of Star Trek Into Darkness. That was the best moment when I was sitting in the cinema, when I was watching the preview. Somehow afterwards I felt I was looking forward to that film more than the present one, but I still felt that when it started, it should be good because you can't judge a film when not seeing it. Oh, as the cliché goes, how wrong I was. One of the only things that really motivated me when I came out of the film was what other films I could see, such as Oz: The Great and Powerful and Star Trek Into Darkness. Seriously, that's what I really wanted.<br/><br/>It's the before and after I really don't like because you have such different reactions, and you can't react afterwards if you haven't seen the film, so you see the film, and you realise how much time you've wasted. But at least I never have to see it again.<br/><br/>There are many perfect reasons why I shouldn't like this film. I was quite unsure where this was actually going. I sat there, waiting for the real plot to appear suddenly, and surprise me, but nope, I was left with empty, visually beautiful scenes of mountains and waterfalls and lush forest. With LOTR, it had that, but we were at least given some depth, like when they were trekking through the mountains, there was given reason and they weren't continually running around pointlessly. I knew what they were doing, and what reason giving why they were so delayed. Even that tackled amazing psychology, such as multiple personality disorder and addiction, but this was just some silly film that Peter Jackson decided to throw together because he thought people liked his films anyway. Wrong move, Jackson.<br/><br/>This also highlights my other point. I think it was the middle of the film, I wasn't too sure, that I sat there, bored out of my own skull. I literally wished that it would end halfway through. While LOTR had legitimate, intelligent stuff that spread thickly across the films, this was just basic filler material in this one, in order to spread this out so thinly to make 3 films out of it.<br/><br/>And why, oh why, did it have such stupid humour? Stupid in the aspect that it was low-brow and didn't appear to have any real meaning and was quite useless, to be honest. Other times, it felt quite forced, as if the people behind it really had to work hard to actually make it funny.<br/><br/>The film just didn't have the same magnificence and real meaning to it like the LOTR trilogy. You can't make 3 films out of one book, which is exactly why Peter Jackson decided to add some unfunny humour and empty scenes in order to fill 3 hours. I was like 'O.K, so are we going to see the dragon? No? Not even the Necromancer? That was like 5 seconds. Anything else? No? Look, do something, I'm bored'.<br/><br/>About the only good people in this film was Martin Freeman, who actually had the ability to act, and Andy Serkis, who did an amazing portrayal of Gollum; there wasn't a chance for me to see Ian McKellen properly as Gandalf. The dwarfs sucked, they seemed as if they were only there for the kids. I can really understand why the critics are saying that this film really screwed up.<br/><br/>What happened, Jackson? Your trilogy was so engaging, why did this feel so childish, brightly coloured, over dramatic and overlong? Have you now begun your descent into doing this ONLY to make money? I'm not even sure if I want to see the second and third ones. Otherwise, I'll only be that desperate to see how Benedict Cumberbatch has portrayed the dragon and the Necromancer. Or maybe I won't, because that would probably be the only redeeming feature in the film. I can always catch the clips on Youtube."
"akash_sebastian","6","7","22","14 December 2012"," Disappointed! Doesn't have enough story to be a separate movie entirely!
","Disappointed! I agree I didn't expect something as great as LOTR, but still the movie lacks many things. It doesn't have enough story and depth to sustain your interest, and to be a movie separately. J.R.R Tolkien wrote 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy' after the critical and financial success of 'The Hobbit'. And ironically, Peter Jackson, who skipped the 'The Hobbit' and made 'Lord of the Rings' into a movie, made 'The Hobbit' after the critical and financial success of the latter. 'The Hobbit' clicked as a book since it took us into Tolkien's new world and described the creatures there. But in movies, since we already know about the world, it doesn't have enough story to carry it forward for three parts (thanks to Peter Jackson's fetish for detail).<br/><br/>The score is good, camera-work different and a little unsuitable. Fight, flight and respite - Jackson's storytelling style - needs some changing. After watching LOTR so many times, people need something new to keep them hooked.<br/><br/>Gollum has just one scene. But it's a well-directed and terrifically-acted out scene. That scene alone stopped me from complaining any more about the movie. Andy Serkis, you are amazing as always!<br/><br/>You can still watch it if you're a fan of the series; hope the next two parts are better!"
"guitarhero_nsf","6","7","22","14 December 2012"," Overrated
","Really good directing skills and nice fight scenes; Peter Jackson has a top quality way to put us in the mood! However, as a huge Tolkien fan, The Hobbit was a movie that disappointed me because it copies all the scenes from the Lord Of The Rings like: Gandalf once again breaks the rock with his stick, he raises his voice in the same way in the Back End, he whispers to a butterfly and the golum scene is like a comedy. Also it has way too many unnecessary scenes like the whole story with Radagast and many others. Finally i don't like the American Hollywood attitude like when you're about to die and you have a smart thing to say before doing so. ESPECIALLY since you're an orc! I wish it was more like the LOTR in ways of originality and quality...."
"warjamy","6","7","22","13 December 2012"," Good visuals, predictable narrative, unconvincing acting
","I read The Hobbit many years ago (well before the Lord if the Rings, the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, etc) but I had a somewhat different picture in my mind as to what a movie adaptation would be like. Yes, Tolkien had re-written it to fit it to his Middle-Earth mythology but I had the impression The Hobbit was mainly a nice and sometimes funny kids story.<br/><br/>This movie is not and I don't think I would bring my kids to watch it. It is Lord of Rings in high frame rate and 3D packed with more actions scenes and violence. And I think that it is a very weak point. While I do enjoy 3D, and the HFR was not a problem to me (my wife got a headache ...), I think that the movie narrative has borrowed way too much from LOTR #1. It felt like Peter Jackson picked the LOTR1 storyboard and force-fitted The Hobbit story into it.<br/><br/>And to be honest, I don't see the point of making 3 long movies out of this story. A single movie, even 3 hours long, would have been enough.<br/><br/>But, being a fan of Tolkien, I still enjoyed most of it except for the extra bits that are not part of the book. I also had the weird impression like the LOTR actors who played in The Hobbit felt like they had to dust off and wear old clothes/ costumes / whigs that hey had happily gotten rid of 10 years ago ... just my impression but I did not find them very convincing. The world has moved on since LOTR and The Hobbit felt too much like a rehash of an old recipe the taste of which is no longer so fancy ..."

It is as if Peter Jackson is expecting the viewer to already know what Hobbits are, he may be right! Other than that, I would love to see it again. I saw it in 3D, high frame rate, the sharpness is unlike anything you have seen before. Absolute magic. 10/10"
"ed-421","6","5","14","24 December 2012"," Too much low-quality filler spoiling the brew
","Some examples of the low points of the movie, that merely chew up time unproductively: .<br/><br/>1. A harmless stick insect in someone's mouth, but which almost a minute of movie time is spent on.<br/><br/>2. Moths flying in and out of a snoring character's mouth for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>3. A huge wattle of fat dangling from the chin of a character, with the camera focused on it swaying around for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>4. A troll blowing his nose repeatedly for about 30 seconds.<br/><br/>5. A long, long fall of a triple-decker structure for about 30 seconds.<br/><br/>6. Radagast is involved in the same chase pratfall about 6 times in a row. A few of those times, the CGI looked exceptionally poor. Why not just repeat the pratfall 3 times where it looked better? Or just avoid the pratfall.<br/><br/>7. Golf. Balls. Deposits.<br/><br/>I've been a big Peter Jackson fan for years, and I've watched everything he's done, including Bad Taste and Forgotten Silver. I thought his first serious low point as a director was with Jimmy the Cabin Boy in King Kong. He spent half an hour on that character for no coherent reason. Here, he's showing the same weaknesses. With the above 3 minutes of movie trimmed or excised, I'd have given the movie 2 more stars.<br/><br/>Why couldn't each of the dwarfs had at least one line, or at least said their own name? All that said .. I did like many of the embellishments. The Necromancer is an interesting storyline (but they haven't really gotten to it yet). I loved seeing Saruman (but not with a brown beard), and I thought the actors with speaking rolls did fine.<br/><br/>I'd have been happier with more careful trimming."
"m-betts06","10","5","14","18 December 2012"," The HOBBIT is a work of art! Ignore the nay-saying critics, its better than the book so far! (in 2D 24fps
","Yep, I said it, better than the book so far! Some critics panned the Hobbit for taking too long to get going, too much unnecessary padding, and not all the Dwarfs get much to do.<br/><br/>Well, aside from the last point about the Dwarfs not all getting to do much I heartily disagree! I found the film breezed by, I actually wish it was longer (Thank-you PJ for the extended cuts which I will be buying) Hopefully some of that extra footage will be more Dwarf action from the ones that I don't remember speaking at all, or maybe they get their shot in the future films. Seeing this masterpiece of a beginning chapter, I'm already awestruck at what it will all look like as a whole when the trilogy is complete. Del Toro's signature is also still over this with those Goblin designs, and they look terrific. Better in the film than in still images and merchandise that I've seen.<br/><br/>I was daunted by seeing this as it had 65% RT score, and I had read some bad mouthing (mostly about the 3D 48fpr, so I saw it in standard 24fps 2D showing.) Which was great but now I'm curious as much of it was very aimed at 3D. I'll see it again next week i think to compare.<br/><br/>It was great how it felt more fun and brisk than the darker serious LOTR, but it blended very well. It never got boring or plodded like some of LOTR, and some characters added really did add a lot to the world, the book I found too brisk and hard to imagine some of what was going on, but the film really immersed the viewer into each scene. Gollum was a huge highlight, and he has never looked or acted better than in this. Freeman was also brilliant as Bilbo. Erebor was absolutely stunning as was the Dragons golden lair.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hobbit filled middle earth more than its book by this point in its journey, and welcome the padding is. (I have faith that in film 2 or 3 when Smaug does his thing, it will be a high voltage visual treat rather than the 2 pages of quick action described in the book, and the battle of the 5 armies, Beorn, spiders etc.. all still to come. PJ did right by splitting this over 3 films.<br/><br/>10/10 from me! (almost a 9/10 because some dwarfs didn't say much, but, there's no way this masterpiece deserved a 9 based on a few tiny gripes.<br/><br/>This film, and DREDD are my top 2 films of 2012."

"PhoenixElite","9","5","14","17 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Expected Masterpiece
","I'd been anxiously awaiting The Hobbit for a while now, and I have certainly not been the only one. I admit I was kind of skeptical when I found out it would be broken up into three films; I certainly understand doing that with The Lord of the Rings, which is a literary mammoth of its own, but The Hobbit barely tops 300 pages. But I had faith in Peter Jackson et al, and it seems it was not misplaced. I am not so naive as to discard the economic benefit of it, but there are certainly other merits to ""stretching out"" the story which they could (and do) exploit.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is ambitious in that its three-hour run-time covers only a third of its relatively short source material, so naturally the crew added a lot of back-story and had plenty of time for character development. But little of it felt forced in or otherwise unnecessary. In fact, the film manages to convey the perpetual blitheness of the book and mix it in with more mature thematic elements without taking itself too seriously. If there is one aspect in which I felt the book was lacking was in its character development. For example, in the novel the audience is suddenly introduced to 13 dwarfs, but barely any time is spared afterwards to cultivate them as individuals.<br/><br/>To be fair to Tolkien, The Hobbit is purposefully more easygoing than its sequel and is directed to a younger audience. In that sense it is very successful, but in the end it is a very dense story and the adventures portrayed feel sort of compacted for the sake of brevity. The film manages to give each journey its due time, and with its immense budget it portrays each and every one of them beautifully. That is a merit in and of itself; scenically, the film is astounding and the attention to detail Oscar-worthy. The Shire and Rivendell are as beautiful as ever, if not more so. The wardrobe and makeup are, of course, marvelous, and they should expect a few shout-outs in the upcoming awards. But I digress...<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the filmmakers do take a lot of liberties in their additions, I felt that they were always faithful to the spirit of the original lore. The role of Radagast the Brown, for example, who is barely mentioned in the novel, evidences the ingenuity of the crew (I am being careful not to say ""director"", because naturally a film of this scale is the product of the collective effort of hundreds if not thousands of people).<br/><br/>As for the actors, it goes without saying that Ian McKellen once more nails his role as Gandalf. This time around, his character appropriately feels a bit younger and more light-hearted, without losing the wisdom, strength and charisma he brought to the original trilogy, adjusting perfectly to the spirit of The Hobbit. The script provides him with more than a couple of wonderful, witty and charming lines that will stick with the viewer, some of which Tolkien wrote himself and others which are the product of the geniality of the filmmakers. His performance is a true tour de force (as tacky as I know that phrase reads).<br/><br/>The unknown variable I was most curious about was Martin Freeman as a young Bilbo Baggins. I'd seen him before as Watson in the BBC series Sherlock Holmes and I suspected, from the trailers, that he would do a wonderful job. If I was surprised, it was for the better. He captures the charm and sometimes self-berating appeal of the character brilliantly. It is also remarkable how he manages to maintain the mien that Ian Holm set as a precedent for Bilbo and make that attitude ""younger"". I am certainly looking forward to more screen time from him. His dynamic with Gollum in the much-expected riddle scene is also noteworthy (and the scene itself is masterful, as is Serkis as the enigmatic creature).<br/><br/>The film score deserves a mention of its own. Howard Shore had a winning formula with the first three films and he knows just when to ""import"" the thematic elements that made the music so memorable. But he also takes some risks with his orchestrations and the end result works fantastically. The ""Misty Mountain"" song from the trailer sees a lot of instrumental variations, which give the film a certain leitmotif without feeling repetitive.<br/><br/>Most of the film works perfectly, or as close as makes no matter. The weakest link for me was Richard Armitage as Thorin. It seems the filmmakers went with the ""troubled leader"" persona that's admittedly been done to death, but his character is oft more infuriating than anything. However, I expect he will be made more appealing in the following installments. I also felt that the role of the Great Goblin and Azog were a bit too monochromatic.<br/><br/>Despite these shortcomings, The Hobbit is without a doubt a masterpiece in its own rights. There are many more things I could mention but I feel my review is already lengthy enough. Let me recapitulate by saying this: if there are three words I would use to describe this film, they would be CHARMING, ENDEARING and, most of all, ADVENTUROUS. To enjoy the full experience and to relish in the audiovisual spectacle, I would recommend the best home theater system you have access to (if you missed it in the big screen). A film like this doesn't come around very often. Don't miss it for the world."

"dagelis_antanas","10","5","14","17 December 2012"," Criticts were soooo wrong!
","First time i write a review on a film... I am not a big fan of fantasy films, but since in Italy it was the only film which was opening in original language me and my wife decided to go. I told to her if it is as bad as critics say we will have at least 3 hours of good sleep...<br/><br/>And then those 3 hours finished i was like: What? it has ended! i want some more, please continue!!! Contains a small portion of spoilers...<br/><br/>1. Critics were wrong (my opinion) telling that it is too long. Maybe you could take out some 10-15 min of the movie but not more if you want to keep up with the book. so i think general idea of the 3 films is good. The 3 things director added to the original book script only gives additional depth to the film as THE director tries to show that the main story is just an episode of a bigger, darker picture and characters behind it who still haven't reveled themselves, but you can start guessing who will be the villain in the meeting at Rivendell. So personally to me it didn't fell too long at all. And i don't count other peoples money especially if these money are made by pure talent.<br/><br/>2. Critics are not fair enough telling that the movie is much worse then LOTR. Yes it is different, it still misses human presence, which remove some of the depth. But IT IS BASED ON A BOOK so i think the only way you can judge the film is if the production team perfectly revealed the book contents in the film or not. You cant make Shindlers list out of Hobbit if you are doing a movie based on Hobbit book. And to my opinion the production team just perfectly captures the story, do not skip any details from the film and the parts they add only brings it closer to the LOTR movie epics. <br/><br/>All in all 10/10. Good acting. Perfect talented cast. Not boring action film. I liked special effects - didn't look unnatural (i've watched in 2D though). The sound... they use the same theme music, but its so nice i don't mind!"
"davespix","10","5","14","15 December 2012"," Add The Hobbit to the pantheon of epic classic films!
","Well, to say that this movie is state of the art seems an understatement. And even ""State of the Art"" seems to be open to other qualifiers since our theater is showing this film in, Digital Cinema, RealD 3D, High Frame Rate - RealD 3D and finally XD High Frame Rate - RealD 3D with Dolby Atmos. So to preface this review, I have to state that I watched this film in the simple RealD 3D offering.<br/><br/>However, that being said, the film still seems remarkably HIGH DEF to me. In fact, perhaps a little TOO much so, but I'll go in to that later.<br/><br/>Part of the legend and magic of this story in the previous LOTR trilogy is the mood, the mystery, the cinematography and the music. All of those blend together to create a world we have all fallen in love with. And the Hobbit continues in this tradition as we all hoped it would. At moments during the film I had to keep reminding myself that these short dwarfs and shorter hobbits and taller wizards and elves were not all on the screen acting together. Peter Jackson had to use his FX magic to make all the characters the right size as they moved in and about their places. It was just amazing to see how seamlessly they blended all the characters together in their spaces ... as if I were watching and walking among all of them in real time.<br/><br/>And this effect is ALL the more vivid when viewing the film in 3D. It is absolutely amazing to see all the characters so real that you can see the texture on their skin. This goes for the REAL characters AND the CG characters. Watching this film in 3D, even the ""cheaper"" form of 3D I watched it in is literally the next best thing to BEING a character in the movie. You would almost swear you were in the room with them.<br/><br/>However, this leads me to my ONE lament about all this realism ... unfortunately, part of the mystery and allure of this film or any other fantasy is the ""other world"" feel you get from the graininess of the film process. Like an impressionist painting, part of the charm in watching this type of movie is being transported to a world that ""isn't quite real"" ... a fantasy ... an OTHER world. The old film process along with any other added FX or coloring processes would allow for this mystical feeling in a film. Unfortunately, this film had more of a quality such as HD video tape or some other HD process. The mystery of the grain and blur of the film process is gone. It just felt TOO REAL.<br/><br/>Now for some, that might not be a negative, but for me, I found the hyper realism a little disappointing at times. I wanted a little more fantasy and mysterious mood as was presented in the previous LOTR's movies that I've come to know and love. But that's not a minus when it comes to seeing our heroes run through the grand scenery. Seeing these wonderful lands in HD 3D from all the stunning angles Jackson gives us is a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>But that being said, the Hobbit is still an amazing film, a great story, and is rendered so well in 3D now that you feel it natural to BE IN a room with hobbits and dwarfs without having to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>And we see several of our old favorite characters again, though they are supposed to be many years younger than we remembered them. Again, the FX and make up people did a great job of making them look relatively the same or younger as when we first saw them 10 years ago.<br/><br/>All in all, this film, like the LOTR franchise before it, is destined to be a classic."
"azureblueflame","10","5","14","15 December 2012"," Middle Earth like it has never been before.
","A good film is often defined as one which does not at all fail to captivate it's audience and believe me, The Hobbit strikes you as an epitome of cinema making. Peter Jackson along with his talented crew and epic music composer Howard Shore does it again and the result is a film which viewers won't forget so easily. May it be from the soul touching music to the natural acting of the actors or even the awe inspiring landscape, The Hobbit will take you on an epic journey of adventure and fantasy and is your one way ticket to the world Of The Middle Earth. With Funny anecdotes kept here and there, a serious or bored face will be very difficult to keep. The story transports us to the time before the legend of The Ring began, that is, the story of the Old Bilbo Baggins who found the ring and with that find shaped the future of Middle Earth. The movie is made in such a manner that it will keep you guessing what is to come next, every line spoken, ever verse sung, each will keep you engrossed. For every fantasy or even a movie lover, this is a must watch for everyone out there. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was fantastic but The Hobbit is so much lighter, so much free that it's wittiness and it's light charm won't fail to give you satisfaction. I can only say this that Peter Jackson has started another epic Trilogy into the fantastic world of Middle Earth and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ends this year in the film industry with a fitting tribute. So, I ask everyone out there to go and have a watch for it will be worth everyone's time and to all music lovers, don't forget to stay till the end of the movie for the song at the credits is a masterpiece and so is the entire film!"

"mattgolden-445-783875","5","5","14","14 December 2012"," Good, but different.
","***SPOILERS BELOW*** Alright. The first thing I thought when I walked out of the movie theater was how disappointing it was. But now you're thinking, ""Well then why Matthew G, did you give the movie an 8/10?"" Let me explain. Despite having read the books I expected unrealistic things from this movie. Same director, same location so the movies should be similar. Wrong. The LOTR trilogy is epic, the story is about a great evil rising in the land and threatening all of its inhabitants. The Hobbit is simply the transformation of a few character to what we see later in the trilogy.(Bilbo, and Gandalf). In The Hobbit I think there was a great setup for Gandalf to develop later in the new trilogy. A Subplot involving Radagast (brown wizard) where he discovers a great evil developing turns out to be the Witch King gaining power, which in turn means that Sauron is recovering from his defeat. This should come to light in the second movie around when the rest of the crew, which I'm pretty psyched for if I must say. The pale orc was also an interesting bit, it seemed unnecessary until I realized it set up Thorin's acceptance of Bilbo, and Bilbo's emergence as the character we'll see in the rest of the movies. So it's necessary, but it just seems out of place- apparently it was taken from the appendices or the Similarion which included some extra juicy lore, so it's canon.<br/><br/>Visually the movie was stunning. I saw it in IMAX 3D 48fps. I found that the large view scenes were the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in a movie. With the end, Riddles in the dark, and Rivendale taking the flag for my favorite scenes. 48 fps may be controversial, but its inclusion with 3D gives an immersed feeling I have never felt in film before. That being said, at times it could be distracting (I partially attribute this to the fact that I was seated close to the front). Up-close scenes felt... weird, but the large panning shots Jackson loves doing looked better than ever. I'm excited to see where these movies go, Peter does not disappoint and neither do the actors. Strong performances by everyone, even though the dwarfs other than Thorin are (rightfully) kind of ignored. They still acted quite well.<br/><br/>I'm excited to see where Peter Jackson takes us in the future."

","There are a couple of kinds of people that will not find this movie to their tastes. Firstly those that, for whatever reason, don't like the fantasy genre itself (of which there seems to be quite a few movie critics). Secondly, those with high expectations - especially Tolkien canon obsessives - of what the movie ought to be. <br/><br/>This movie is really a deliberate prequel to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, rather than a straight adaptation of The Hobbit itself. It's narrative is designed in exactly the same way, relying heavily on backstory. The tone is pretty much the same while the characters largely correspond with the same archetypes - whereas Thorin is presented in the book as a slightly comical, pompous figure he's basically a 'True King' figure, like Aragorn, here. There is also a lot of visual and thematic references to Rings movies - a lot more than in the book, which reflects on the fact that The Hobbit was written way before Lord of the Rings came out, making such references pretty pointless!<br/><br/>The movie is long, like the original Trilogy, and ponderous in parts, although the action sequences, effects and amiability of the characters make up for it. For those wishing to explore the fuller reaches of the Middle Earth world, then this is the movie for them. New beasties, like Stone Trolls, Goblins (with a pretty good Goblin King), Spiders, Wargs (more wolf-like than before) Stone Giants and a Dragon are mixed with new characters and places. Radagast (the Brown Wizard) isn't quite as annoying as some have argued, although he is played for laughs. The visuals are a step above anything seen in the Rings movies too. <br/><br/>I questioned the need for a 'Trilogy' being made from such a short book, but in fact the narrative worked here, in and of itself, as effective as what we saw in the original Trilogy. Taken as a movie in itself, without reference to anything else (hard I know), this movie is still light years ahead of any other fantasy franchise out there. As for the 3D and frame rate, I had sore eyes after nearly 3 hours of wearing glasses. Just sayin'."

"gregfried8","6","6","18","20 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)
","When it was announced that Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) would be extending The Hobbit into a trilogy, many wondered how the director would manage to stretch a seemingly brief story into roughly 9 hours worth of epic filmmaking. The first film in the series, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey attempts to recall the epic scale of the preceding trilogy by combining deliberate pacing with Jackson's tireless attention to detail with mostly mixed results. While An Unexpected Journey has its strengths, including Jackson's typically excellent camera work and charming performances from star Martin Freeman (BBC's Sherlock) and Ian McKellen (reprising his Gandalf role from the previous Lord of the Rings films), the film unfortunately feels like an overlong prologue stretched well beyond its means. <br/><br/>Much of An Unexpected Journey's first half is spent reintroducing viewers to Middle Earth while also presenting the new cast of regulars who better fit into the Hobbit mythology. Forced to carry more narrative elements than it can handle, the film begins to feel drawn out and unfocused as it progresses. Tone is also an issue here. The film seems too jokey for its own good, cramming its broad humor into so much of the journey that the scenes with more dramatic weight attached to them actually feel like a pleasant change of pace. One scene specifically, featuring a trio of monstrous trolls attempting their best Three Stooges impressions will surely leave some viewers rolling their eyes.<br/><br/>Presented in 3D at 48 frames per second (the way Jackson has said he meant the film to be seen), the film often looks like a cross between a video game and the world's most expensive soap opera. There are several truly breathtaking landscape shots, but as the camera creeps closer towards its subjects everything begins to look cartoonish and artificial. The action sequences are most affected, closer resembling a World of Warcraft game than the wonderfully staged battles seen in the Lord of the Rings series. The higher frame rate ultimately seems more like a gimmicky distraction than a technological game-changer. <br/><br/>For better or worse, The Hobbit trilogy will always be tied to, and unfairly measured against Jackson's previous Lord of the Rings trilogy. The acting here is mostly strong, the set pieces rich and elaborate, and the narrative primed for a more momentous turn when the series resumes. Still, while it may not be fair to call An Unexpected Journey a bad film, it certainly struggles to live up to its triumphant predecessors."

","What a Spectacular movie! I never thought anyone, even Peter Jackson, could beat the class of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Well, The Hobbit is well on its way! <br/><br/>I watched the movie in 3D and though it doesn't have that great 3D effects, the overall product is a masterpiece. The graphics and soundtrack are at par with LOTR and I wouldn't be surprised if Peter Jackson wins a new set of Oscars for these.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't yet know, the movie is a prequel to the LOTR trilogy. It begins with the story of Bilbo Baggins and has many scenes which you will remember from LOTR. The connection between the two franchises is superb. The movie is a little more light hearted at places which is great and it manages to make you smile and even laugh at many instances. The action is awesome and you can easily compare it with LOTR - in short, the movie feels very familiar and yet very original. <br/><br/>9.5/10. Waiting for Part-2."

","Although I enjoyed the Lord of the Ring trilogy, I found this film to be very poor in terms of visualizations, costuming, plot, and character development. The film can't make up it's mind if it wants to be serious or slapstick. As a result it's a muddle of fantastically silly contrived action scenes, poorly made up Dwarfs (apparently proper make up was not important to the budget), and lifeless script that didn't even try to make the adventure interesting. What is really disappointing is that this film had an opportunity to excel, but Jackson did not attempt it. I get the impression that this part of the story was not interesting to him so he just tried to get past it in the hopes that the second film will make up for this close to crummy effort. This is not a film I would want to see again. I can't say the film was a complete stinker, but it was not what I expected in terms of professionalism. The good thing about this film it will surely make the second film appear better."

","If any of you are at all skeptical of the smallish book being made into three feature length films, cast your doubts aside. Jackson took the classic novel, and expanded upon it. While the book was a fun ride, the first film in the trilogy takes it to a whole new depth. The story is adapted beautifully, with enough added detail and back story to provide a fun filled ride. There was barely a slow moment once the story began, and at the end it didn't feel like a (nearly) three hour film at all. Like the Lord of the Rings films, Jackson did a fantastic job of bringing the viewer into the world of Middle Earth. Within the first few minutes I was already in awe of the beautiful and elaborate sets that the characters are placed in. The cinematography is decent, although many shots seem reminiscent of Jackson's earlier films. I was nervous about how Martin Freeman would portray such a beloved character and the uncle of Frodo, but I was convinced that he was the right choice just a few minutes into the film. Bilbo isn't the typical story book hero to begin with, but Freeman brought emotion into the character, and I felt attached to him instantly. Overall, let's just say I plan on seeing it again within the next week. A must see, especially for fans of the previous Lord of the Rings films."

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey 3D 48fps (Frames per Second)<br/><br/>Starring: Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage and Andy Serkis<br/><br/>#New Line Cinema & MGM, if your turning a 365 page story into a trilogy only because you know people we spend money on it, I'll be annoyed and not too annoyed not to see it but I hope as it's my favorite of the Tolkien novels it's done to its best. â€“ Alex Powell November 2012<br/><br/>Synopsis: J.R.R Tolkien's story of a little hobbit called Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), this maybe a familiar name to anyone who has seen the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy a few years ago. This is how Bilbo became an adventurer and on this particular quest with thirteen Dwarfs invited by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to raid the stolen treasure hoard and retrieve it back from a very dangerous dragon called Smaug.<br/><br/>#Spoilers may be contained, nothing to essential or purposely provided. <br/><br/>Review: My first questions when I heard about The Hobbit are they going to keep to the story of the novel or make it more relevant to the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy? After seeing the film my question was answered in full, yes to both. Peter Jackson (Director) brings middle earth back to the cinema with his very own stylish camera angles and with a pleasant mix of CGI and practical effects which brings this fantasy world to life. <br/><br/>Starting at an unusual point, from the beginning of the 'Fellowship of the Ring' we see Ian Holm (Bilbo LOTR Trilogy) getting ready for his party and starting to write his story of a particular adventure he once took. As the story begins and now sixty years earlier Martin Freeman (Sherlock & The Office) takes to the role of Bilbo excellently, playing the part as Ian originally did however still bringing some of his own character traits to help make it his own role. Ian McKellen returning as Gandalf the Grey is as good as ever. <br/><br/>To make use of making this story a trilogy Peter Jackson said he was going to use the appendices from Tolkien's notes and other novels written, I didn't think it was going to be woven in to the story of the Hobbit so well, making middle-earth seem more populated and seeing a faint undertone that Sauron is already becoming a presence to the world, making this film even for fans of the novel a different story and will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson makes a lot more use of all thirteen Dwarfs as I always felt in the novel five of the Dwarfs where just secondary characters that aren't needed. Making great use of the 'Lord of the Rings' scores and bringing new ones for this tale, however the Dwarfs songs aren't a big part of the story as in the novel a minor irritation and maybe they were trying to keep away from 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' territory. <br/><br/>From the title of this review you may be wondering way the description of the 'Frames per Second (fps)', it's because they made a clear decision when making the film to film using over thirty 3D camera's and in this particular fps giving better clarity, as on close up shots of the cast, seeing imperfections to skin and other details never really seen before. The 3D isn't used as a gimmick in the movie either, as in 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows part 2' or 'Toy Story 3' only giving a greater depth, you won't see Gollum (Andy Serkis) jumping towards you or any other gimmick. <br/><br/>It has to be acknowledged that Thorin (Richard Armitage) Balin, Dwalin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili and Kili, Oin, Gloin, Nori, Dori and Ori play equally fantastic and humorous parts as the others, stand out performances for me with exception to Gollum and Bilbo was Bofur (James Nesbitt) making me laugh throughout the film. <br/><br/>Watch this if you liked: Lord of the Rings Trilogy <br/><br/>Verdict: I'm glad I was made to eat my words and see an almost perfect adaption to one of my childhood favorite novels. Excellent, highly recommended and I'm seeing this again on the cinema."
"PoulMorgan_Arn","8","6","18","12 December 2012"," A great experience (might contain minor spoiler)
","After watching the premiere of ""the hobbit: an unexpected journey"", I could finally breathe out in relief, and know that The Hobbit trilogy is off at a good start. All in all, ""an unexpected journey"" is fantastic film which stays true to the nature of J.J.R Tolkien and his universe. The film does in fact go into a bit more detail and might contain some parts which were not added in the original novel ""the hobbit"", but never the less, it is a marvelous journey back to middle earth. The story was great compared with the novel, but it also stands strong alone as film. Some scenes and prologues might have large similarities with the LOTR trilogy, but nothing that hurts or compromises the movie. Fight scenes were well choreographed (in my opinion), but I feel that some fast paced scenes might get a bit blurry with the 3d and the animation. Dialogue is warm and familiar, while at the same time they manage to pull of the new ""not so elegant"" dialogue of the dwarfs. Martin Freeman has portrayed a very convincing Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is strong and prominent as ever. <br/><br/>It has a runtime of 169 minutes, which is a handsome but necessary amount of time for the fantasy genre. When it comes to the 3d experience, I was a bit skeptic at first, but know that the combination between 48fps and the 3d effects is stunning. Middle-earth is simply beautiful. The 3d does enhance the cinematic experience, but does not enhance the film experience. When it comes to critics discussing and claiming that ""an unexpected journey"" is just a dumbed down version of Lord of The Rings, please keep in mind that the atmosphere in novels ""The Hobbit"" and ""the Lord of The Rings"" are very different. ""The Hobbit"" was meant a children and young adult's book, while ""LOTR"" aimed for a bit older audience. This is because that ""LOTR"" both the novel and trilogy have a darker tone and feel to it and it is in fact a battle between good and evil. While in the ""Hobbit"" both the novel and the movie have a warm feel, and the journey is more personal. In other words, it is a fantastic film which brings joy and tension towards the audience. It Stays true to the novel ""The Hobbit"" and its atmosphere. Some scenes might feel a bit off or forced, along with some minor characters. Amazing cinematic experience, along with breath taking scenery. Fantastic story which leaves a warm feeling inside you long after the film is done. 8/10"

He comes across like a drafted soldier, he didn't expect to be there, well, now he is, and his effort can save lives... will he answer the call?). Comparison to the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings films(which you do not need to watch first, albeit there are hints towards it that you will appreciate if you have, with roles returning(strangely looking 70 years older than they're supposed to be...)) is unavoidable - the instant thing to note is that this is a fairie tale, while that is epic fantasy, meaning this is less complex and more light, child-friendly(got 'em? Bring 'em. Don't just send them to it, go with them. You'll enjoy it, together). Seriously, this has such charm and humor(more than the other three combined), you can't help but be swept up in it, enjoy this all-out dive into the expanding world of Middle Earth that surrounds you(unlike Fellowship, this is not gradually getting you used to it), with several, distinct and credible, beautiful New Zealand locations and creative, unforgettable monster designs(Orcs, trolls and ones we haven't seen before... more total than the others), prosthetics that allow for immense expression. That's part of the great blend of seamless CGI and practical FX that have you believing in all you see in this. Where this is going to bother people is its slow pace, lack of drive and minimal plot(keep in mind that the Rings novels, put together, are 3 times longer than this one... yes, there is a lot of padding, stuff that could have been cut, if Jackson hadn't, presumably so the fans wouldn't have to wait so long, decided to just put the Extended Edition of the picture in the cinema... with that said, there's nothing I wouldn't miss!). If you're only casually into fantasy, or you're here for the story(which, here, starts and stops, stalls, goes off on tangents) more than the exposition, the parts that flesh out the universe it takes place in, you may not like this, and I can't really blame you(only respectfully disagree... I personally enjoyed this the most of the four). As such, there are many characters and all have personality and lines(many of them memorable, and the dialog remains old English, without requiring notes to keep up with), and plenty of eye-candy and action(fast, exciting, well-choreographed and nicely balancing being chaotic with allowing you to keep up with it, to where you can follow the progress, and yet can't recount it completely afterwards, and so much going on(without being overwhelming) that you can see it again, and just look at another part of the screen... and the climax is amazing). The 3D of this is similar to that of Avatar, it doesn't throw stuff at you constantly, it builds atmosphere. And if you have a chance to watch the 48 frames per second(twice the usual), which brightens it up and smooths out the motion, I suggest it, if you don't think you're prone to getting sick from it. It takes 15 minutes to get used to(until then, it looks sped-up), at times it can look ""digital fake"", and it is a slight strain on your eyes(don't force them to concentrate on much else the rest of that day... it'll be worth it)... and other than that, it truly feels like it's right in front of you. There is a lot of mild, bloodless violence and potentially disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise. 9/10"

Anyway, I wasn't a big fan of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy so I wasn't overly excited about this movie. I loved the parts with Gollum and some of the CGI looked amazing, but I did lose interest in the film. I suppose that was my fault because I didn't really know who was who. To be honest, it just seemed like Peter Jackson wanted to show off what he can do, which will make everyone rush to the cinema to see the whole trilogy. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: It's obvious that Peter Jackson is going to milk this franchise for what he can get because with 3D technology and the extended Blu-Rays, he will definitely be able to retire. I don't know how close this film was to the books so I can't really comment on the storyline, but I would have liked an actor with more charisma in the leading role.

","I am a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings. All 3 films are easily in my favourites list. When I heard Peter Jackson was to head the Hobbit, this was exciting news. Then they announced it would be split into 3 parts and I was unsure about that. After watching the first part of this trilogy, my fears were somewhat realised. The Hobbit is by no means a long book, so to split it into 3 films would be like butter spread over too much toast. Jackson remedies this somewhat by bringing in characters and plot lines not in the book and the film still runs to about 2 and a half hours. I understand it was deliberately paced in this way but I felt it was a bit slow in parts and I think it would've been perfect if it was 2 films instead of 3.<br/><br/>However, the film is brilliantly cast. Martin Freeman plays a superb Bilbo, the ""normal"" person in the crazy bunch of characters. He plays the part of the viewer, doubting and showing fear where the rest charge fearlessly. Cameos from some of the LOTR cast are also welcome, as are the locations and sets. All said and done, I still really enjoyed this. As much as people will complain that the franchise is being milked, in all honesty I'm happy for any opportunity to revisit Jackson's middle-earth and if he wants to spread it over 3 films, then so be it. If you're a fan of the LOTR universe you'll watch this anyway, and in no way do I regret doing so. I'll re-watch it in the near future and hope it'll grow on me more then."

","When I first heard that Peter Jackson planned on adapting The Hobbit into 3 parts, I must say I was rather worried how they would turn out to be. Would it be dragging things too far? Did Bilbo have it in him for 3 movies? The Lord of the Rings had hordes of characters, side - plots, twists and long descriptive passages. It had to have 3 parts.<br/><br/>However, after I watched this film in the theater, I was as captivated as when I was watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jackson directed a hell of a movie here. It was surprising that the movie was so long, but I didn't mind. In fact, I felt like it should never end. <br/><br/>Although the Lord of the Rings trilogy was great and visionary, it didn't match the tone of the book exactly. J. R. R. Tolkien (the author of both works) created a world where the characters were not as hostile as shown in the trilogy. Of course, the antagonists were exactly as they are shown, but characters like Faramir, Boromir, Theoden etc are portrayed like villains who turn to friends in the end. However, here in this movie, the makers have kept the tone exactly like in the book. Jackson has made a beautiful piece of art. He has included some things that weren't mentioned in the book (The Hobbit), like the Michael Palin - like character of Radagast the wizard (mentioned briefly in The Lord of the rings books), or a council between Gandalf, Lady Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman, where Gandalf expresses his misgivings about the Dark Lord (the titular Lord of the Rings). Galadriel and he are shown to be on excellent terms, which is exactly how they are in the books (she secretly wanted Gandalf to be the head of the Wizard Council). It is things like these that make you wonder how many times Peter Jackson must have read and re-read the Tolkien books.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the film is flawless. A scene where the Dwarfs run into giant 'Transformers' - like rock monsters was absolutely unnecessary. Maybe they must have been mentioned in the appendices by Tolkien, but they didn't fit in here.<br/><br/>But I digress. In a nutshell, the Hobbit is a loyal adaptation of its source material (both the Hobbit and Lord of the rings) and a thrilling ride. Do not be discouraged by the length of the movie. I assure you, it's well worth your time. I, for myself, can't wait for the next part!<br/><br/>NOTE: I would advise those who haven't seen it to first watch the Lord of the rings and then go for this."

His fantastic direction again made me plunge in the ravishing adventure at dark ages. His significance in detailed characterization is what I liked most. In each section of cinematography, music, visual effects, makeup and setting, Hobbit made home-runs. Martin Freeman was terrific as young Bilbo while the Thorin Richard earned top-notched performance. Though some questioned about the length of the movie with the relevance of story, I could not lose my gaze for a single moment and had to utter after finishing the film, if it were a bit longer :p An excellent prelude of another amazing trilogy :p___"

","The Hobbit is considered by many to be the finest work of fantasy ever written. Worldwide, somewhere between 35 and 100 million copies of The Hobbit have been sold since it was published in 1937. This is a book that has sparked the imaginations of many young people and become somewhat of a cultural force.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey"" is the first in what is to become a Hobbit trilogy. Even if you don't particularly like the LOTR movies, or enjoy fantasy fiction as a rule, you will enjoy this movie. It's easy to follow, humorous, exciting, curious, and outright beautiful at times.<br/><br/>It's absolutely astonishing what filmmakers are able to do now with computer graphics. But this movie is much more than just that. Something is different about this movie. I can't put my finger on it. Is it the character development? The writing? Peter Jackson and his team have developed to the point where they seem to breathe life into the story and its characters. It's nothing less than cinematographic artistry and craftsmanship. The scenes with the Great Goblin and the Gollum in particular were astonishing. I've never seen anything like that on film before. The acting skills of Humphries and Serkis shine through these computer-generated characters.<br/><br/>It helps that Tolkien's imagination and writing lay behind it all. To be honest, I was not that impressed by the LOTR movies. This is by far the best Tolkien movie they've made so far. Jackson et al. have done this classic justice.<br/><br/>Ten is not an extreme score in the circumstances, but I have a few quibbles about various small things not worth mentioning. All in all, I was thoroughly entertained by this film."
"toqtaqiya2","7","3","7","13 February 2013"," A fantastic return to Middle-earth.
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fine return to form for director Peter Jackson. Guillermo del Toro, who's one of the writers for the film, was initially supposed to direct but he left the project in May of 2010. If this first film in the new fantasy trilogy is a sign of what's to come I certainly look forward to seeing The Desolation Of Smaug and There And Back Again. As Gandalf the Grey says at the beginning of the film this is an adventure. Ian McKellen is just as good as ever in his role as the wizard. Maybe he's even better than before since I found his character more likable. While watching the film I didn't at all doubt that he is Gandalf. Martin Freeman is excellent as well in the role of Bilbo Baggins. He does well with his character's insecurity and the humor, which comes often in the course of the film. At first Bilbo is clearly reluctant to get involved in the adventure but after everything that happens he manages to prove his importance to the company. The company of dwarfs is well realized, just like everything else. Richard Armitage expresses authority as Thorin Oakenshield. Every dwarf has a distinct look and personality. The special effects are impressive too. The Lord Of The Rings trilogy has special effects that look good even now but in The Hobbit it's clear from the beginning that CGI improved in ten years. The look of every creature is impressive and even terrifying. This is especially noticeable with Gollum (Andy Serkis), who now looks completely realistic. Some people questioned Jackson's decision to make a trilogy out of one book, expressing that there's not enough material for this. It's not really a problem however. In Jackson's hands the film doesn't lose steam until the very end and the grandeur is still there, made clear from the very begging when Bilbo describes Thror's rule of the Lonely Mountain. The running time is 169 minutes but it seems much shorter because there isn't really a dull moment. Like I mentioned before the acting is impressive. Of note is Sylvester McCoy's appearance as Radagast the Brown. The Hobbit doesn't have the sense of drama of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy yet it's a perfect prequel. I recommend it."
"madage-601-303777","8","3","7","12 February 2013"," Good. Very enjoyable for LOTR fans.
","Actually, I've already written everything in the summary.<br/><br/>Technical background is 10 out of 10. I rarely do some film cutting, my eyes were noticed the 48 fps. It is not like soap operas' frame rate, it is more than that. It makes the image living.<br/><br/>Landscapes are beautiful, characters appear from the main Lord of the Rings story, not for a long time, but Gandalf, who is a main character of the film also.<br/><br/>For a Lord of the Rings fan it's an almost-three-hour-experience of Tolkien's amazing world, and for an average guy, it's a good film for relaxing at home after work."
"johnmschofield","8","3","7","11 February 2013"," Really enjoyable romp
","I had not read any of the books or watched any of the films before so this was a voyage of discovery and at the end of the nearly three hours I was captivated by this film. I didn't fully understand all that was portrayed but I will gladly watch it again to fill in any gaps. It felt like a classy film but then again I am a Lord of the Rings or films associated with the Rings virgin so I can only go by what I saw in this film. I would recommend anyone watch this film because in my opinion it engulfs you early and you are transported into it, that is always a good sign in my case. I cared about the characters and was riveted to the screen following the storyline. My friend was equally impressed by this film and she is very hard to impress and remarked at the end that there was still a long way to go to the obvious destination therefore there could be one possibly two more films covering that part of the journey. Anyway we enjoyed it and we both look forward to the next instalment whenever it is made."
"estebangonzalez10","6","3","7","29 January 2013"," Good but disappointing compared to The Lord of the Rings trilogy
","¨My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. Well, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.¨<br/><br/>After the huge success that Peter Jackson had adapting The Lord of the Rings trilogy, he brings us the prequel (which he has decided to do in three films as well). Of course fans are coming into this film with huge expectations, and I'm sure that fans of Tolkien will really love Jackson 's direction here since he himself is a huge fan of the series. I really loved his work in The Lord of the Rings, but wasn't really too excited about The Hobbit. First of all, as much as I enjoyed the original trilogy, I couldn't manage to watch those films again since I find them hard to rewatch, especially for being so long. Second I really wasn't thrilled when I heard that Jackson was making three films instead of only two. This meant that the film would stretch out a little too far by adding some unnecessary elements that perhaps only true fans of the series would enjoy. Those fears were fulfilled while I was enduring the 160 minute long movie. I really didn't get into the film until the last 60 minutes or so when Gollum appeared. The film actually takes 40 minutes before the actual journey even begins. I felt Jackson was just trying to stretch out the film a little too much so he could have an excuse to make three films and make a bigger profit. Well I have to admit the final third of the movie did raise my grade for The Hobbit and made it a worthwhile watch. I wouldn't recommend it if you haven't seen The Lord of the Rings, but if you have and you enjoyed those fabulous movies you might want to check this out with a bit lowered expectations. I really don't think this trilogy was necessary, but fans might not agree with me.<br/><br/>Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is approached by Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to go on a journey alongside 13 warrior dwarfs who want to reclaim their mountain home. The Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor was once majestic and powerful, but a fire dragon named Smaug, attracted by the gold, attacked them and forced them out of the mountain. The dwarfs were forced to live as nomads and their King was murdered by Azog the orc during war. The King's grandson, Thorin (Richard Armitage), survived and led his people bravely to victory, but it came at a huge price. Now 60 years later he and 12 other dwarfs have decided to go on a quest with the help of Gandalf- the magician- and Bilbo who Gandalf insists must travel with them. He sees good and kindness in the hobbit, who he knows will be a good ally in times of need. Once they begin their journey towards the mountain they face several different kinds of enemies. It is not until they reach the goblin tunnels that Bilbo runs into Gollum (Andy Serkis) and finds the ring (which we are all familiar with from The Lord of the Rings trilogy). The quest for the mountain lies ahead, but they must face many more obstacles first.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson once again delivers great visuals with some great looking fight scenes. It is nothing we haven't seen before in his other works, but it still is magnificent to look at. He also adds a few cameos from some of the characters we have all come to love, but in all honesty I had a lot of problems with the pacing of this film. It just took forever to get started and I had a hard time watching this. Perhaps the second film will be better in that there won't need to be an introduction and we are already set into the action because the final third of the movie was pretty good. The film however is still very far from accomplishing what Jackson did in the original trilogy. He just pays so much attention to detail that the narrative feels too stretched out. This adventure film has its moments that make the movie worthwhile, but other moments feel completely dull and tiresome. I felt like there were several obstacles I had to get over before I could really sit down and enjoy the movie. This isn't a bad movie; I would say it is more of a disappointing one considering it had to live up to the high standards of its predecessor. Another thing I felt didn't work as well as in the original trilogy was the comedy. I found most of the funny scenes pretty unfunny actually and a little too forced. The jokes didn't really work with me. The visuals as spectacular as they might be are not corresponded well with the narrative and pacing of the film which left me weary and tedious. Having that said, this is still much better than most of the sequels that have been made and fans will be pleased with Jackson's work. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"theredraylives","7","3","7","26 January 2013"," Overindulgence in Middle-Earth
","The Hobbit tells the tale of a young(er) Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) who is dragged into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarven kingdom of Erebor from the dragon Smaug, who has overthrown it. The film begins with a tie-in to The Lord of the Rings with Old Bilbo and Frodo (the returning Ian Holm and Elijah Wood, respectively), wherein Bilbo sits down to recount his tales. It is here that Jackson makes his first misstep, so early in the film- does anyone need to see this? A better question may be, in fact, what does this add to The Hobbit, and how does this better tie it to LOTR? Nothing, to the first, and it doesn't, to the second. If the film needs to have a bridge to LOTR (which is in itself debatable), then it can just be Old Bilbo, from behind, sitting down to begin writing his book. Does anyone need to see the ""no admittance"" sign from Fellowship nailed to the door, or Frodo heading off into the woods to surprise Gandalf? No, is the answer. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film finally gets around to telling its own story, with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) not-so-subtly nudging Bilbo into the quest to reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor by turning his home into a meeting place for the company of dwarfs who set out to reclaim it. The party arrives, one or two or a few at a time, and proceeds to eat Bilbo out of house and home before getting down to the business at hand upon the arrival of the leader, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage). After an exhaustive amount of screen time (if it was Peter Jackson's intention to make the audience feel suffocated and claustrophobic trapped in the hobbit hole, mission accomplished), the party finally sets out for their homeland, with Bilbo deciding to run after them and join them after some initial hesitation.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film isn't the changes it makes to the book. Nor is it the film's attempts to tie the film into the larger Lord of the Rings universe for its audience. It is in continually overindulgent scenes that carry on far longer than they need to. While the subplot with Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) is enjoyable and important to the link that Jackson is trying to make to LOTR, why does he ride a ridiculous rabbit-drawn sleigh? Repeatedly? It looks utterly ridiculous, the same for Radagast himself, who has a thick, crusty trail of bird droppings matting down part of his hair. Similarly ridiculous is the entire sequence in the goblin city with Gandalf and the dwarfs, be it the utterly absurd goblin king and his fifty-six chins that swing with his every movement or the frantic escape from said city, in which it becomes almost cartoonishly stupid.<br/><br/>Luckily, however, the eye-rolling and groaning moments such as these are few and far between, and the remainder of the film is incredibly strong. The 3D, for the most part, was used effectively, giving Jackson a greater depth of field and a broader setting to tell his story, and is seldom used gratuitously. Strong performances from McKellan and Armitage are wonderful companions to the fantastic performance of Martin Freeman, who continually makes his Bilbo feel like a frightened outsider who simply doesn't belong. As the film continues, however, he gains strength and courage, and truly becomes a member of the company, and once separated from it his absence seems erroneous.<br/><br/>While separated from the company, Bilbo has a chance encounter with the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), with whom he plays a game of riddles, hoping to escape from the cave with his life (and uneaten!). He also finds a mysterious ring and wins the game, making off with the 'precious' ring and earning Gollum's enduring hatred. The film's villain, the pale orc Azog, feels similar to the Uruk-Hai in Fellowship of the Ring in that he is not nearly as threatening as the threats that loom over the horizon, particularly as Smaug is awakened as the film ends. Not to detract from the action sequences involving him, but it feels a little ""been there, done that"" and feels like a pointless side-journey en route to the true evil and the real adventure.<br/><br/>Overall, Peter Jackson could use a lesson or two in ""less is more"" and one only imagines that with the impending arrival of the dragon in the next installment, it will not be a lesson learned. Clearly, Jackson faced a daunting task of adapting what is a children's novel for a broader audience, and (unnecessarily) felt the need to tie it to his Lord of the Rings adaptation. Overall his success remains to be seen, but whereas his trilogy a decade ago practically begged for more in any way possible, his Hobbit instead asks for a break. Shave 20 minutes off the runtime and cut out the really absurd and nonsensical CGI overdoses, and this would be every bit as epic as the trilogy that preceded it. Instead Jackson delivers an overlong, mostly-wonderful epic that can't quite find the charm it so desperately needs.<br/><br/>Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!"

","and this is not a surprise. because it reflects passion of Jackson for story. and it is not exactly an adaptation - spirit of novel has as root extraordinary vision of director. only problem - it seems be strange as part of trilogy. and this ambition makes film to long and , for few fragments, confuse. it is only a novel for children. the dream of Jackson makes it more. but before this problems, it is the joy. the pure joy of public and actors and the meeting with few old friends heroes. fight scenes, monsters and gnomes are really beautiful. so, a delight. spectacular, nice and epic. sure, it is not Lord of Rings. but its chances to be are not little."

","The Hobbit is one of the best movies this year and why? to answer that let's go into detail and start with what else but the beginning.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is a chance for Middle-earth to finally breathe and introduce Bilbo Baggins who is played by Martin Freeman who gives a good performance, rising from a regular Hobbit to a strong Character. One day Gandalf the Grey, a wizard steps on his doorstep and invites him on a journey, an unexpected Journey. Ian McKellen who portrays Gandalf gives another stunning performance. The Dwarfs are some bad but some very good. The good ones are Thorin, Balinn, Dwalinn, Kili and Bofur but the rest lack which is the movies biggest flaw, but i think that is what the other 2 movies are for. The other scenes are long but well worthwhile. the movie has it's flaws but the pros well outrank the cons. So that the movie becomes Epic, Funny, Grand and Dramatic and the music is what creates morphs all of that all at the same time. Overall a simply good Movie."
"sazo-2","8","3","7","19 January 2013"," Back to Middle Earth
","The film is an excellent tribute to the original novel, it is a more mature version of it. While The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not reach the standards created by The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it fits quite well in the LOTR filmography and universe.<br/><br/>The realization is fantastic, the attention to detail is breathtaking. Yes, there are a few forced elements in the film, like the barfing and salivation of dwarfs, trolls. But unlike others, my main little complaints are related to the small story changes, not from the The Hobbit but the LOTR appendix. The death of Thrór, grandfather of Thorin could have been left as it was in the novel to explain the War of the Dwarfs and Orcs. As well as the role of Dáin II Ironfoot in the Battle of Nanduhirion. If Bolg have been left in the story as it was in the book, it could have helped to emphasize the Orc-Dwarf antipathy by the Orc's desire to avenge his father.<br/><br/>Apart from the above the film is almost flawless. The acting is great, the story development is very good. The score is familiar but perfectly realized. And if you are carried along by the storytelling, you won't be distracted by the CGI. All that discussion related to the effects is over-hyped.<br/><br/>I think some dissatisfaction also comes from the fact that this film lacks monumental battle scene. There is the Battle of Nanduhirion (or Azanulbizar), but since it is a flashback, it is short. Maybe spending a little more time and money on this instead of CGI saliva could have satisfied some, who remained without the taste of grandiose in their mouth.<br/><br/>Of course, another aspect is that this film lacks the novelty factor. When The Fellowship of the Ring came out, it was fresh, nothing ever seen before in cinema. And it was completed masterfully by the two monumental sequels. The little flaws were overlooked. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not possess this only the expectation factor. The critics were eager to emphasize the film's flaws.<br/><br/>So, don't mind the critics. The film is very good, Jackson's tendency for quality shines from it. Hope that the sequels will be perfect and the critics will be satisfied."

"vytautas-m","8","3","7","9 January 2013"," Jackson is back. Not so magical and epic as ""Fellowship of the Ring"", but still amazing.
","""Lord of the Rings"" in 2001-2003 brought to the creators 17 Oscars and the international recognition for Peter Jackson – until now he is called one of the best directors nowadays. Even now the trilogy remains as one of the most profitable and known as one of the best in history. So it's not surprising that even with all the difficulties and delays, the same team started to work with ""The Hobbit"" and bring it to the screens.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film first is seen 48 frames per second shooting difference. The view moves faster than usual, looks brighter and decorations, you can see that it's like a fake. However, it attracted attention just in the first minutes and when the film progresses, it doesn't make negative emotions, while the movement of the action scenes can be compared to a video game. By the way, the quality of 3D was really good, eyes didn't hurt after the end and during the film.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes although slow, but really did not bored, it is interesting to see the new characters. I haven't read the book so the whole story is not known for me. Well, the remaining time gives enough action, spectacular natural images, visual effects and music. You know that it's the same world as the ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>Perhaps the dwarfs will get more attention in the sequels, because after the film it's hard to remember them. Only the leader stays in memory, while others, except maybe 2-3, doesn't. On the other hand it would be quite difficult to remember 13 characters, especially with similar names. Freeman is perfectly as Bilbo. He's comical, good heart, devoted to fellows character. We need to wait until the end of the film to see Gollum, but the game between him and Bilbo is one of the best places in the film.<br/><br/>It was a good film, but lacked the magical atmosphere, wasn't so epic. Also the characters doesn't attract so much attention, you don't feel together, there wasn't so much emotions as was with the fellowship of the ring. Now, it's more like a single film, the less serious than ""Lord of the Rings"". So, waiting for another parts to look and rate all three films."
"surefilms","8","3","7","9 January 2013"," Like visiting an old friend
","The Hobbit had a lot to do, a prequel to the all conquering Lord of the Rings trilogy, a smaller book, aimed at a younger audience but it doesn't seem to have hampered the film. Yes the film has some scenes which could have been missed out but any extra time spent in Peter Jackson's middle earth is magical.<br/><br/>Jackson appears to be operating with a little more freedom here, with more mythical creatures making their way into the film. The mountain trolls are a particular highlight and they show a flair for comedy that illustrates the slight tonal switch of this film from its predecessors. The man who makes the film is Martin Freeman's Bilbo. He anchors the film and is much more likable and easier to relate to than Frodo, with Freeman optimising the every man. His scenes with Gollum is arguably the best in the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes are solid as expected but they do lack a little of the scale and importance of the battles in Lord of the Rings. This could be a criticism, the stakes just are not as high in this film but again this doesn't hold the film back. Also the pacing has come under question and at times the film does feel episodic. I thought the higher frame rate would let the film down but I was wrong. It takes a while to get used to for sure, Ian Holm's Bilbo just doesn't look right, how can the same actor look so different? Luckily he isn't in the film long. <br/><br/>As I said in the title it is like visiting an old friend. You ignore the imperfections and just enjoy your time together. And what an amazing time it is!

I went with high expectations because Peter Jackson is awesome, but man, they weren't high ENOUGH. <br/><br/>I couldn't see any flaw in this movie at all, they do change the way some events happened, but they're details and don't really change the story, actually you can tell they were needed.<br/><br/>A problem I thought I would have was with the amount of Dwarfs names I would have to remember, it turns out this was not nearly as arduous as I thought it would be through the progression of the story. <br/><br/>Jackson also adds some information, but he did say beforehand that he would, and is taken from other Tolkien stories, and as I haven't read them, I was very happy with the change because they were things I didn't know. <br/><br/>The way the movie starts is very clever, and the whole introduction before the journey is almost exactly like the book, which I enjoyed very much. <br/><br/>The fights scenes, just exactly as LOTR are INCREDIBLE,very well done, and with some funny moments as well.

"amit_imt2002","9","3","7","8 January 2013"," An unexpected delight..a visual treat!
","Peter Jackson is at it again pushing the limits of what the cinematic medium can do.He harnesses the power of 3D and marries it to his innovation of shooting at 48 frames per second.The result is a film which looks almost unreal and beautiful beyond belief. Films are conventionally shot at the rate of 24 frames per second which essentially means that the film camera exposes 24 individual single surface of photographic film in a second and when this is played back it creates the illusion of motion.This convention has served cinema well but shooting at 48 fps gives the film a crispness and brilliance while reducing blur and flicker, the only rival of which is the 70mm format.When the budgets of films have swelled to zillions of dollars spending a few hundred thousand extra on film stock seems logical to achieve a superior look.This film creates a new standard much in the same way that Avatar did when it reinvented 3D technology.While Peter Jackson may not have toiled as hard as James Cameron in the research department his idea of increasing the frame rate manages to achieve a breakthrough.<br/><br/>The genres of fantasy adventure and sci fi need something special to keep us engaged with it.There is no dearth of films out there that gives us flying monsters,dragons,cute adolescent heroes, bearded sorcerers and ethereal witches all played by droll and charming British actors.When the makers of the money spinner Lord Of The Ring trilogy (Ben Bernankie could have funded his quantitative easing with the proceeds) turns his mind to bringing a prequel to the big screen the expectations are more than sky high.Jackson used the other worldly landscapes of New Zealand to great advantage in the LOTR trilogy and singlehandedly revived the tourism industry there.But the man is not all flashy effects, his way of story telling with a maddening attention to detail is something that was quite evident even in King Kong where he had us believe that King Kong was indeed in love with Naomi Watts.The scene with her dancing and jumping to impress upon Mr Kong that he should love her and not dash her against a rock is a piece of great direction. The Hobbit was published in 1937 for younger readers unlike the LOTR books which had to contend with the dark shadow of WW2.While the LOTR films deeply divided Tolkien fans about reducing the book to an action adventure instead of the charm of the hobbits who occupied centerstage in the book, The Hobbit starts off on its own terms. In circa 2012 Peter Jackson presents his own version on his own terms for an audience reared on high definition high octane video games.The film displays some of the innocence of Tolkiens book at the beginning with an exuberant impromptu dinner party of dwarfs much to the exasperation of the unwilling host Bilbo Baggins.The middle act, however, treads typical LOTR territory, very competently and full of inventive monsters, ogres, elves and what not.All this of course presented in the 48fps 3D which has none of the dimness of the typical 3D flick.<br/><br/>The Hobbit while unable to bring anything spectacularly new to the table in terms of content or storytelling grammar dazzles all through its nearly three hour length on the strength of its technical excellence and fine performances set to stirring background music.This film was made on a budget on 180 million USD which is roughly 1000 crore India rupees. This ""product"" can be consumed for about 300 Rupees or 15 USD depending on your location.Its eye popping bang for the buck!!Another way to judge a piece of entertainment is the return on your time.If the Hobbit trilogy runs for 9 hours that will be more than the time taken to read the book. Films deliver us the stories of novels in a fraction of the time taken to read the books and get much vilified in the process.This time the films may need more of our time, cost three times a single copy of the book and come in three installments over 2.5 years.Thats the power of the global blockbuster for you.Oh and I forgot the cost of the popcorn!"

"s_quinland","8","3","7","7 January 2013"," The Hobbit: A Personal Story
","I have seen the previous movie and TV incarnations of The Hobbit – huge, horrible messes, and could never figure out why they were so bad. The book told a fairly simple and very personal story of one person's journey into something bigger than himself, in finding reserves and strength he would never have know that he had, of a cleverness and ability to think on this feet, of a hero emerging out of a common man So why did the previous terrible movies even get made?? One was a silly cartoon, stripped of any deep emotion or urgency, and that other one that was so filled with horrible special effect battles, and very little else, as it they were the whole story. So. Now, on to Peter Jackson's interpretation After the grandiose vision presented in LOTR, I expected an epic. I expected gorgeous vistas. I expected great special effects and creepy critters. What I did not expect was the humor, the up close and personal aspects of the book coming alive in very capable actors' eyes. Ian McKlellan seemed a less sure wizard, a bit more watchful and uncertain of the outcome. Martin Freeman as Bilbo was spot on in his quizzical and comical reactions to the unfolding events. Time was spent getting to know these characters, and most of them got enough screen time to bring them alive, to see the different personalities emerge. They were engaging and fun, powerfully evil (although is it just me, or did the pale orc just keep ordering his minions to kill/go after/behead our heroes, even though he was standing right there? Seems kinda cowardly to me), majestically ethereal (Kate Blanchette's Galadriel was perfect; the costuming, the lighting, everything was simply gorgeous), strange and compelling, outrageously difficult and campy At 169 minutes, it drags a little in a few places, but quickly steers back on course. Bilbo's introduction to Gollum was brilliantly creepy and funny, weird and felt very important, as we all know it was. The special effects were very nearly perfect; the big critters had mass and weight and various weird skin conditions, each of them was individual, no cookie cutter CGI monsters here! The battles were well lit so discerning what was happening was much easier than in much of LOTR, which at times seemed to be a gore-fest without much purpose. There were some places where the special effects take over the movie (think thunder mountains) to no real purpose other than to put the band of travelers in jeopardy and show off technical skill. The size differences of the various main characters were seamlessly executed, and after the first few minutes of the movie, I forgot about them and just immersed myself in the film although the Bilbo's (and Frodo's) big hairy feet still looked like a bad toupee had been stapled to a slab of heavy inflexible plastic with barely carved toes. It has been decades since I have read the Hobbit and LOTR. I have heard that there were changes in this, the first part of what appears to be a trilogy based on The Hobbit, but the story line seems intact and clear; whatever changes there were did not seem to distract from the movie experience. Except the cloak, I did miss the cloak; it seemed weird that Bilbo could just duck down and suddenly no one notices him anymore. Engaging, fun, intense, epic and personal, I am very much looking forward to Part II!"

","The Hobbit is a prequel to lord of the rings. A young Hobbit (Bilbo Baggins), has a unexpected guest come over to invite for an adventure. (Gandolf) Bilbo kicks him out. later at like 6:00 at night or so. I don't know. A bunch of dwarfs, warriors and Gandolf. (Gandolf is not really important until later.(nagging nerds, I have to deal with you!)) they all go off to have an adventure to find a lost kingdom. (Don't nag, because I don't know names!) Let me tell you the story & acting is good. But, GOD DAMN! the visuals are spectacular! I saw this in 3-D and it ruled. Worth the headache. They also filmed with a frame rate of 47 frames per second, which... believe it or not. That also causes a headache. The movie was great and I can't wait for the next one to come out."
"bobbleheadcpcc","9","3","7","7 January 2013"," Next level LOTR
","From a long awaited impatience, i went to see this film as soon as possible, and it did not disappoint. With outstanding visuals from the very start, i was at no point near the back of my seat, glued to the action packed, yet cleverly spread special effects, i found the whole movie enthralling. I had doubts about how Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage would step up to such a big title, and a frankly high bar for serious fantasy, yet they did not disappoint, with a ""rough ready warrior"" taken on well by Armitage and a more quirky hobbit portrayed by Freeman, both roles took a well deserved centre stage in my estimations. The thought of returning to middle earth seemed like a shot in the foot possibility for the franchise, but the movie's impact on audience and overall likeness to the LOTR's style, made this movie a rejuvenating addition to the box office hits. This movie, as i have already mentioned was action packed, but more effectively than the LOTR's were, with only short gaps of inactivity, before the next battle or conflict began. In addition the return of gollum seemed a welcome prospect for many fans, but the character they thought they new, in fact had a more impacting personality in this movie, as he was half way through his transition from smeagol to gollum, the personality split was more obvious, and smeagol had a more human like tint, that would seem to conflict audiences ideas of loving or hating the creature. Overall the movie was a triumph. And the same as when the LOTR's first appeared, i cant help but see The Hobbit movies only getting better. Outstanding."

","There is no chance that any commentators have as much Tolkien knowledge as I do, and besides for the fact that I cannot write well, I will freely admit as a hardcore fan of the book and all books Middle-Earth and Undying Lands related I was VERY skeptical when hearing The Hobbit was made into a 3 part movie. Frank Zappa's critique on 'The Beatles' ""They're only in it for the money,"" is indeed most appropriate for the releasing of The Hobbit. However, I know Peter Jackson, I know his work and he is (simply put) consistent with all the movies he has ever done; sweeping and over the top. I do not doubt he and his team (wife) put an incredible amount of thought and effort into creating a cinematic story that the public can enjoy. We holders of the Tolkien word can only awe and await in anticipation his creation of the rest of this story. Believe me, if I had the ability to, I would try, and while I don't like all aspects of the content or rendering of his/this book, I know he has Tolkien at heart and will wait with anticipation for his next two installments."

He has successfully brought us on an journey of epic proportion yet again. This Movie will keep you glued to your seat and your eyes centered.

"jsdana09","6","3","7","5 January 2013"," Falls Short
","There are lots of people rating this movie as the greatest thing ever, but really if you compare it to the original series you'd have to admit it falls far short. Originally Orcs were quite illiterate and ignorant creatures, and even the super orcs only slightly more articulate but very well suited for doing the evil deeds of dark forces. These orcs were well versed in the queens English and quite comical, almost cartoonish. I didn't get the same sense of a growing darkness and menacing evil. The mountain trolls were just super sized versions of Larry , Moe, and Curly with lots of corn-ball humor that all seemed out of place considering the impending doom. The mountain rock-creatures served no purpose to the movie. They could have been something conjured up by an evil force to impede the good guys journey but apparently were just a random rock em sock-em rock fight. The cave fighting scenes wore me out, and the eagle rescue at the end had me wondering why Gandolf didn't order up the flight right from the start and save them and us from all the trouble. Overall it feels more like it was made to appeal to children instead of serious Lord of the Ring fans."
"paul_haakonsen","7","3","7","4 January 2013"," Visually great, but somewhat flawed on the characters...
","Having enjoyed the first three movies that Peter Jackson managed to shake out of his creative sleeve, then of course I had to watch the prequel as well. Although I am a big fan of the fantasy genre, I have never really delved into the hype about these movies. Sure they are enjoyable, but not masterpieces. What was really great about ""The Hobbit"" for me, was all the places that I recognized from having played Lord of the Rings Online.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie, was as in the previous ones, great and nicely detailed. However, I think the band of dwarfs were too generic and lacked individual personalities. The movie didn't really focus enough on the dwarfs, nor did it give them much chance to really form and build any characteristics. It was more about showing off spectacular landscapes and majestic scenery.<br/><br/>Although being a huge fantasy fan, I never got around to reading any of Tolkiens work, but always had the plan to do so. So as in terms of how much (or not) ""The Hobbit"" is true to the story that Tolkien wrote down and immortalized, that I can only guess about. But there is a lot of work that has been put into the movie, especially with the level of details there is to everything. And as a fan of details, then it was a real treat to sit through this movie.<br/><br/>The wargs, orcs and goblins were, as the prior movies, really nicely detailed. However, how odd it is to say, then they were actually displaying more individual characteristics and personalities than the band of dwarfs did. Which was sort of a sad thing. All throughout the movie, you just really root for one single dwarf, and that being Thorin, while the rest merely just get the occasional shrug of the shoulders, as they are too generic.<br/><br/>Having worked in a bookstore, I am familiar with the size of the novel ""The Hobbit"", so it is sort of interesting how Peter Jackson is planning to turn it into a full trilogy - as that is how I have come to understand this to turn out to become. I guess a whole lot more of prolonged scenes of showing off landscapes and scenery as he did in this one.<br/><br/>On a personal note, then it would be interesting to see the Dungeons & Dragons universe brought to life with the same amount of money and production value as they used for the Lord of the Rings movies.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Hobbit"" is a beautiful movie that is entertaining, but could have used a tad more energy on the characters that the story revolved around."
"cmvaggs","8","3","7","4 January 2013"," Nice try but not as good as LOTR
","Almost a decade after the end of the LOTR trilogy we have the Hobbit! A book that is Tolkien's as the others. I saw the movie with an inspective eye because of the previous three. I mean, they was an epic. Now, we have a childish book trying to steal some of the magic. The first half of the movie was a little bit boring but again Peter Jackson did great job! All the scenery was miracle. The Howard Sore again on the music composition made a song that fits in the darkness that dwarfs carry. All twelve of them had not a big impact on the movie as i was expecting as Gandalf and Bilbo stole the show It was a mistake that they divided the book ( The Hobbit ) into three movies because they became so detailed that sometimes was a bit tiring. Overally it was not a bad job but it didn't reach the standards set in the first trilogy. The story didn't helped so much. I think that making Sillmarilion would be a better idea. Still a must watch movie for every epic fantasy fan. Really worth of it's hype. At the end it leaves the viewer with the pleasure that he spent nice his almost three hours. I would give it a 8.5/10"
"frezeframe","6","6","19","15 December 2012"," The Hallmark Hobbit
","On it's own, this film is a solid 8, by Hollywood blockbuster standards. However, because it's intentionally designed to work together with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, you can't have a conversation about a Hobbit movie without comparing it to one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film (LOTR). The Hobbit Unexpected Journey falls short of that bar by a considerable margin. It's not bad movie by any means. Go see it if you haven't! But it is disappointing. To use the parlance of our times, here's a win/fail operandi:<br/><br/>Win: <br/><br/>1. GOLLUM'S CAVE- Stunning. <br/><br/>2. FIGHTS BETWEEN THORIN AND WHITE ORC- The rivalry is one dimensional, but very intense.<br/><br/>3. GANDALF'S EAGLES- will leave your jaw open. <br/><br/>3. RIVENDALE- Rich with dialogue (although most of it was unnecessary as it foreshadowed what we already know will happen in LOTR), texture, and Gandalf subtext. Incredible acting and set design... and the Christopher Lee cameo was most welcome.<br/><br/>4. MARTIN FREEMAN-Completely nailed it. Unassuming, matter-of-fact like. He was Bilbo. <br/><br/>Fail: <br/><br/>1. RADAGAST- Really? A Santa Claus sleigh being towed by rabbits? Zipping back and forth across the hills, making Warg dogs chase it? It just looked ridiculous. Radagast was given about 30 minutes of slapstick screen time. He was over the top and animated like a Disney character- going cross-eyed while smoking marijuana from Gandalf's pipe- sure it got a chuckle, but it's cheesy and not consistent with the tone of the LOTR Trilogy. They could have done this character much better. <br/><br/>2. THE ROCK FIGHT SEQUENCE- Two mountains turn into human rock figures and duke it out for a good long while. It felt like a Transformers movie. Just too much staged action. <br/><br/>3. THE MUSIC- 75% of it was re-mixed from LOTR soundtrack. It was also very pompus and over the top at times- using unoriginal blockbuster orchestra templates. Hugely disappointing for Howard Shore. The original LOTR soundtrack was so groundbreaking. This was the biggest disappointment.<br/><br/>4. AND WHAT IS A DWARF?- They didn't grow on you- plain and simple. They didn't act or behave like great warriors, like J.R.D. portrayed in Gimli. But rather, it was a Hallmark portrayal of Dwarvdom. There was no Gimli here. Not even close. Thorin was the only badass, and he looked and behaved nothing like a Dwarf. <br/><br/>5. THE TROLLS- Very Pixar/Disney like. Not consistent with the look or demeanor of the great Cave Troll in Fellowship of the Ring. And again, the slapstick thing has infected Peter Jackson's ability to tell the epic story on film. It worked for ""Meet the Feebles"" or ""Dead Alive"", but once he made LOTR, he set a new standard. Now we're watching a legend overstay his welcome. <br/><br/>6. THE MOUNTAIN ORC LEADER- Way too animated. This was the Jar-Jar Binks moment. He was like Java the Hut mixed with a less intelligent Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean. It was suspicious.<br/><br/>7. 48 FRAMES PER SECOND- This ruined the entire movie-going experience. It took you out of the story and it made the entire production look like a BBC special. And no... we don't have to ""get used to it."" I'm so tired of that executive excuse. It doesn't work, period. It's shocking that Peter Jackson & studio made this bizarre decision. 24 frames per second is the only way to watch this film or any film. Don't buy into the hype. It's a way for the studios to make an extra 500 Million, because people want to see it both ways. It's disgusting. 48 frames per second is for sports and documentaries. It's technology being misused like the auto-tune. Even if you like the auto-tune effect in some music, you wouldn't want to hear Pink Floyd auto tuned, would you? <br/><br/>The Hobbit has a few good scenes, a half dozen terrible scenes and a few GREAT scenes (Gollum's Cave is hands down the greatest achievement ever in motion capture acting. Andy Serkis' performance in this film really should prompt the Academy to open a new category). But it seems Peter Jackson isn't as hungry this time around. Too much collaboration with Steven Spielberg has clearly clouded his judgment over the last 15 years."

Also the faster frame speed made the film look too sharp as if it was post production waiting for the the bits to be done that makes it feel like the films we all love. I think the faster frame speed would be excellent for nature programs but not films it just does not work! Hoping to watch it again in 2D at a screen that does not show it at the faster frame rate after that my rating hopefully will go up to 10 out of 10 as the 9 rating is only due to the picture not the film"

I wanna see them using soap and taking Prozac to get better, considering the circumstances. I have to admit, I had huge expectations for this movie, but after watching it I was very disappointed. Too many simple mistakes, the set looks fake, the movie insists on too long faces closed shots (see Smeagol - Gollum sequence), the beginning, with the party at Bilbo's house doesn't bring any important significance to the story. Also, at the beginning, during the dwarf caste battle, many are in the fire, but no one has their long hair or beards burnt... Even a cartoon will show more accuracy in that regard... The whole movie looks like Cirque Du Soleil, not even a dwarf is injured, other than their king... After all those battles, nobody has a scratch on their faces, and Bilbo doesn't have a bad experience wearing The Ring. Elves have dark hair (!?!?) after we know Legolas had white hair when he was relatively young... Orks are starting to have more detail, but their voices are too clear and their English is immaculate... Really?"

","I read both the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Hobbit. As many others have mentioned, the Hobbit is a pocket, maybe 1 tenth of the number of pages compared to the LOTR trilogy. So I feared the story would be weak, but watched it anyway, as IMDb viewers gave it a big 8. In the past that meant it should be a good movie, but nowadays it doesn't mean anything anymore. People in the cinema started talking to each other, not paying attention anymore, and although impolite, I don't blame them. The movie was boring. Mr Jackson should have made just one Hobbit movie. That would have been great, but not 3 times an almost 3 hour movie.<br/><br/>Some of the 3D effects were nice, but some were also disturbing, for example, you see some guy sitting on a horse from close by, but you see half a horse coming out of the screen. The only good 3D movie i saw was avatar, and I'm afraid it will be one of the few.<br/><br/>It's good that IMDb now have a critics review, I should have looked at that, and skip paying for seeing this movie in the cinema."

","That can be the only explanation I can think of. Crude jokes, tons of violence, nonstop action, and everyone an action hero - sounds more like a Schwarzenegger film than a Tolkien story. I would love to be able to get inside the director's and producer's heads and see what motivated them to completely disembowel such a wonderful book -- but I'm afraid that what I would find would be far more disgusting than any of the cheap gore shock effects they tried to pawn off in the film as entertainment. This film was terribly disappointing after lots of anticipation. I feel like Jackson's portrayal should be considered an insult to the American public. If the book is a treasure to you, don't tarnish it by viewing this ugly abuse of artistic license. I'm off now to try and erase this mess from my mind by re-reading ""The Hobbit""."

Marvel at the detail. The creatures are an artistic triumph. The goblin king is incredible to see. Gollum is even more detailed and fully realized than in the Rings movies.The Orcs are frightening and sinister.

"tmilionis","10","5","15","22 December 2012"," Dare to embellish..
","I waited long enough to see this movie, read far too many negative reviews from professional critics and was prepared for more than a little disappointment. I need not have worried.<br/><br/>The pacing was perfect. How tired I am of epic stories which build the story and resolve it within two hours. The book may be short but the universe it is set in is fleshed out in the background, warranting plenty of embellishment and diversion. How wonderful to see the dwarfs at the height of their wealth and power in the beginning. How like the books to allow us a change of pace and rest in Rivendell. It make all the difference in the world if you sit back and drink in the story, knowing full well that we have the trials in Mirkwood, the battle with Smaug and the epic war at the end, still to come. <br/><br/>The 3D and HFR was immersive and not intrusive. Smooth camera pans across Middle Earth, slow motion battles and wonderfully executed creatures all benefit from the extra fluidity of the new technique. I have been playing video games for 30 years.... those who say that the film feels like a computer game must be thinking of some computer game from the future where we can render huge underground caverns and thousands of goblins in realtime. Would that Ironforge in Warcraft ever gets to look like the dwarven halls in this movie!<br/><br/>Jackson captures the right level of slapstick with the introduction of the party of dwarfs, without ever diminishing the nobility of each character. The troll sequence is droll and the goblin caves sequence evoke Indy's escape from the Temple of Doom, as Spielberg might have executed it with today's technology.<br/><br/>If I were to call out a minor niggle, it would be the embellishment that the script adds towards the end of the movie. The literal cliff-hanger of a sequence is marred slightly by a key modification which significantly changes Bilbo's status. I would rather have waited for his future heroics to bring him closer to 'rogue, level 60'. Thank goodness the world did not end yesterday, I hope I am still around to see the next two parts."

So, I would say the movie is actually better than the book and this is a very very rear thing. The story telling is amazingly good and simple. The visuals are stunning and acting is simply amazing. I think this is like the first movie in years I am giving a 10 without thinking twice and I am really willing to see it one more time. Moral of the story, this is definitely the best movie of 2012."
"karlbaber-1","8","5","15","19 December 2012"," An exciting film that struggles to come out of the shadow of the Lord of the Rings
","I went into the cinema with a vague sense of weariness. I have heard many reports that this film is mediocre, too long and badly shot. In all three cases, the warnings were wrong. The Hobbit is a great cinematic experience and a cracking family adventure that is true to the original style of J.R. Tolkin's book.<br/><br/>The most vocal of the complaints about this film, has been the decision to film it at 48 frames per second. At no point did I feel the filming technique was detrimental to the film. Unlike some, I never felt the film looked like a 'made for T.V' movie. Nor did the film ever feel too long, or bloated. The 168 minutes of this film passed in the blink of an eye, though some of the scenes did make me feel like I was watching the Directors Cut.<br/><br/>The film also never felt mediocre, the vast majority of the film is terrifically exciting and fun. Peter Jackson has excelled in adding a few embellishments to the original story. The scenes with Gandelf, Saruman, Elrond and Galadriel were excellent, and have set up the possibility of an intriguing side story that chronicles the rise of Sauron. The inclusion of Ganadalf's cousin Radagast (ignored in the LOTR's trilogy) was also a worthy inclusion to the film.<br/><br/>There is however, some disappointing aspects to this film. Perhaps most disappointing is the soundtrack. The score uses rehashed music from LOTR, and in the few cases that it doesn't, the music is instantly forgettable. There is also a lack of the stunning set designs that were so breathtaking in the previous trilogy. Scenes where the Fellowship of the Ring see the 'Great Halls' in the Mines of Moria, or the mammoth stone watchmen after they leave the Galadriel's realm, are sadly lacking in the hobbit. There are still some lovely panoramic views of the enchanting landscape however.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest disappointment in this film is the scene with the goblins in the Misty Mountains. I feel that the whole encounter has been badly misjudged. Worst of all is the head goblin, his character belongs in a Harry Potter movie, not within the world of Tolkin. Although the Hobbit, as a novel, was far lighter than LOTR, I remember the encounter in the Misty Mountains as being eerie and exciting. In the film, the whole scene (apart from Bilbo's encounter with Golum) is just daft.<br/><br/>The biggest problem the Hobbit has, is that it has been filmed after the masterpiece of LOTR. Had LOTR not yet been done, this film, I'm certain, would have received wholly positive reviews as a family classic. The problem is, The Hobbit cannot escape the expectation placed on it from the previous trilogy, which are considered by many to be three of the best films ever made. The Hobbit is not a classic, but it is almost three hours of terrific fun."
"Patruso-Steiner","9","5","15","19 December 2012"," A masterpiece in its own right, not just for the so-called ""fanboys""
","Maybe as a movie this was just good. But as a Tolkien adaptation it was brave, marvelous and almost better than the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>It has the pace of the book, which I find truly epic. You can already feel that this is going to be a three-piece saga. Some may criticize that but I do not even want to start imagining an edited version of this in two movies.<br/><br/>Yes, as a movie (speaking about the crafting that is filmmaking) it may not be 10/10 when it comes to editing. But this - at the same time - makes this movie more than a Hollywood blockbuster. It takes its time. It has scenes purely for the fans. Which filmmakers have been this brave when it comes to adaptations and the mass taste? The HFR (which is amazing in the grand picture) reveals some of the CGI and make-up. But then again, only in minor moments. In others, it looks better than anything I have ever seen before. Most outstanding was the sequence of the flying eagles when it comes to the look. Just breath-taking.<br/><br/>The acting is superb - although I do understand why Freeman and McKellen will go without major nominations. As of yet, there were not the 100% Oscar-moments in their performances simply because the screen-time is split between so many characters. Although the scene between Gandalf and Galadriel ""It is the small things that keeps the darkness at bay"" should get some special award for ""two masters of their art acting the sh*** out of this world"". Blanchett and McKellen are beyond words here.<br/><br/>The highlight - and I can only repeat others here - the game of riddles. What can I say? Serkis is the only actor I would have hoped for some nominations... but I guess the fears of awarding CGI characters is still too big for that. But the scene is simply like a major scene in a staged play. Tony-worthy. The two actors connect so amazingly well that it is heart-breaking to see how Bilbo later looks at the crushed Gollum. Both Freeman and Serkis are the one-and-only actors for these two roles.<br/><br/>I can also live with the changes from the book (this book either NEEDED changes or should have been done as a kids-movie. Given the fact that Tolkien himself was thinking of adapting the Hobbit in LotR style, I think the changes are fine). Maybe the biggest change: Azog. I think Azog looked superb, I do not really get the love for the Gollum CGI and than the complete hate for the Azog CGI. I think most people simply do not like his story-line... but I do understand why they needed a villain who was a constant threat, as Smaug comes in so late in the story and also drops out of it again quite soon after. The story with Azog, and later Bolg, may pay off big-time in the next to films.<br/><br/>What I do not really get is why the Witch-King's story was changed as it was. Buried, really? I think here they were afraid of overdoing it for non-fans in sticking with Tolkien's version. But why not referring to the quote that no man will kill him and that the White Council does not know what happened to him? I do understand why PJ and Co did not want the Council to know about Sauron just yet, that is an okay-change. But the Witch-King feels so unnecessary as of yet.<br/><br/>So, only a fanboy's praise? Not entirely. The tune of the ""Misty Mountains Song"" is too often repeated. And although the recycling of LotR score is epic in some parts (first time we see the ring, Shire, Lorien-theme) it is a bit weird in others (Nazgul-theme in Thorin's final stand, Return of the King-theme when Thorin and Bilbo hug). I hope that it was the plan to underline the similarity between FotR and AUJ through the score and that more new music will hit our ears once we reach Mirkwood, Esgaroth and Erebor.<br/><br/>Also, the troll-scene - though a good adaption of the episode in the book - does not settle completely with the rest of the movie. While all the other comic moments go well with the characters this is the only truly childish-scene IMHO. Nice to finally see on screen - but that could have been shortened a bit, I guess.<br/><br/>All in all - I am back in Middle-Earth and cannot wait for my second time (again in HFR 3D, after Christmas I will see it a third time in LotR 2D style).<br/><br/>Thank you, PJ and company, for being brave enough to make a fan-film, by the hyper-nerd for the little nerds :)"

I watched the old version of Jason and the Argonauts the other day and couldn't help but admire the hard work that the crew put into that movie...hard work which I didn't do...I was just grateful somebody tried."

","I'm a die hard Tolkien fan who has read everything I got my hands into by the age of 15. I first picked LOTR when I was 10 and have been lost ever since into the undying lands, Valinor and middle earth.<br/><br/>When I heard about the Hobbit airing, I was both excited and terrified. The previous 3 movies had been really good (the last 2 with some minor setbacks but tolerable) and I was really worried if the new movie could ever top those. Also the story itself is so very dear to me, I was honestly worried a bad movie might stain it to me forever. Also there is lore to the characters that are not in the hobbit book and yet they are significant to the story - of which leaving out would leave the story hollow. So I was having these really high requirements of what this movie should and shouldn't include, and was almost sure I got disappointed.<br/><br/>Then the movie started. And I was in the Middle Earth once more.<br/><br/>All my life I have considered books better than movies, simply because I believe no movie could ever top my imagination. Or even come close. It is - until the hobbit. I was at Bilbo's home, at all the other wonderful scenery.. I was with Bilbo and the dwarfs, and it was THAT good I forgot they were actors. I had to fight back tears because I was so happy. The hobbit is easily my favorite one of the movies (LOTR + this). For the longest time the Fellowship of the ring was the best one, but the hobbit easily takes the cake now.<br/><br/>The only bad thing to say is that it takes too long for the next movie to air, and I can't WAIT to see more. This movie was worth the 10 year wait and I trust so will the part 2 to the Hobbit. So I wait."
"erinlale","9","5","15","18 December 2012"," surprisingly fun for adults given it was based on a children's book
","Background about my expectations: I am a huge Tolkien fan. I didn't expect to enjoy this movie that much because The Hobbit is a kid's book. I read it when I was 5. Lord of the Rings was written as a sequel to The Hobbit, but for an adult audience because of the amount of time that passed between when Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and when he wrote Lord of the Rings. I only went to see The Hobbit because my best friend took me for a Yule present.<br/><br/>How this movie exceeded my expectations: I enjoyed The Hobbit very much. I was surprised and delighted to see all the cameos by Lord of the Rings characters, which did not appear in the book. Also not in the book, but very welcome for an audience of adult LOTR fans, was the extended storyline about the Necromancer, the Council of the Wise, and the way the movie brought in the story of the Moria orc / dwarf conflict that had been told elsewhere in Tolkien's writings. I loved Radagast. His story had not really been told anywhere in Tolkien's writings, only hinted at, and he was a delightful character that I'm sure appealed to kids as much as he appealed to older Tolkien fans hungry for new Tolkien-y stuff. All of that is stuff that was not in the book, so if I was in ""Tolkien book purist mode"" instead of ""Lord of the Rings fan fiction reader mode"" I would have hated it. This movie is not actually The Hobbit, a movie based on the children's book. It's a completely new work intertextually inserted into the story of The Hobbit, much like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.<br/><br/>Ways the movie stayed true to the book: I was very happy that all the humor and song from the book did appear in the movie. The costumes, props, sets, makeup, etc. looked right for the characters and the story."
"abhishekratna","9","5","15","18 December 2012"," A soaring triumph
","The Hobbit brings Middle Earth alive in ways not seen during the preceding LOTR trilogy. Peter Jackson seems to be getting better in serving grand spectacles with every iteration. At 48 GPS, the difference is clear - no more judder, no more awkward CGI transitions no restrictive camera views, the Camera-work never loses its fluidity through the entire breakneck pacing and gorgeously choreographed action sequences. Some of the vistas simply take your breath away. This is cinema meant for the big screen.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely top notch. Martin Freeman portrays the Hobbit's' spirit of adventure, their love for home and hearth, self-doubt, courage and above all, their hardiness well above what Elijah Wood could ever do. And the dwarfs are played to rugged perfection by the 13 actors with all their pride, toughness and merriment. Gandalf, Galadriel and Elrond are all splendid. Azog the pale Orc is truly menacing. IMO, though, Andy Serkis is the biggest triumph in the presentation, for he takes the challenge of meeting his own exceptional standards from movies past, and gleefully, malevolently raises the bar even higher. This is a Gollum far more visceral than you have seen before - more raw, more menacing, more confused, more playful and more vulnerable all at the same time. <br/><br/>Hardcore fans of Tolkien's fiction would revel in the abundant references to races and legends of the Middle Earth - from Gondolin to Rivendell. Just this first part of the Hobbit trilogy deepens your appreciation of the LOTR saga even more. <br/><br/>Strap yourself in, for this is the journey through Middle Earth that we have been waiting for ever since the movie was announced."
"annie421","9","5","15","15 December 2012"," An expected treat
","Having been a fan of Peter jackson's since the Frighteners, I am well aware that when you are going to see a peter Jackson film expect a certain amount of great visuals and expect great acting even if the story line tends to suffer a tiny bit. So I wasn't surprised going into the Hobbit that I would come out a fan because Peter Jackson delivered as expected. He showed some new scenery of New Zealand and he got the absolute perfect company of dwarfs and goblins and orcs and hobbits. Also there was a return to the familiar with some well placed return characters of Gandalf, old Bilbo,Frodo, Galadriel, Elrond, Saruman and Gollum. <br/><br/>What I loved and why I would recommend it? 1. The company of Dwarfs. Each and everyone of them are identifiable, even if you can't get the name of them right, each actor brings something that makes each dwarf memorable and lovable. Their camaraderie makes the drama believable and their humor lovable. (keep watch for some excellent choreography amongst them in song and fight scenes) 2. Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. He has a really cool gravitas that just makes him larger than life. I mean seriously you watch him and you forget that he is in fact a dwarf and there are creatures of middle earth taller then him. Also his love and protectiveness of his fellow dwarfs. There is a scene where it looks like a few of them might be lost and when they are not the look of heartbreak to relief was spot on. 3. Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Gosh... I can see why Peter Jackson worked the filming schedule around for him. If you are a Sherlock fan definitely watch his performance here. He just has a knack for making any character he plays vulnerable and heroic and lovable. 4. The themes of the story- While the plot points of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are similar (a quest, a stop at Rivenddell, etc) The differences that make this story unique are what make it fun. <br/><br/>what I wasn't too crazy about... 1. The length and the slight Deus Ex Machina feel to the end scene. Not having read the Hobbit I don't know if what happens in the last scene exists in the book but having watched the Lord of the Rings and been slightly bothered then as well... I can't help it, I was slightly bothered.<br/><br/>All in all if you are a fan of Lord of the rings and want to revisit Middle earth, definitely watch it. Plus... if you are watching it within the first two weeks in IMAX 3D( i think thats how long its on for)the first 9 minutes of star trek is an awesome treat."
"bradyxplantdude","9","5","15","15 December 2012"," The Perfect Start To What Will Become a Six-Part Saga
","Through 9 long years, we have endured starts and delays time and again, waiting for that fateful return to the Middle-Earth film fans have come to know and love. The Hobbit is finally here, but it may not be the Middle-Earth some might have expected: there's less death, fewer battles, toned-down fright, and lots of comedy. Contrary to many a pretentious critic, this is not a criticism of mine. In fact, it is the absolutely perfect way to return to this beloved franchise, giving youngsters a chance to immerse themselves in this fantastical world for the first time, giving older viewers a chance to relive their favorite childhood book, and show fans what the world was like before Sauron defiled it. In short, Peter Jackson made a brilliant, and risky, move to make his latest outing to Middle-Earth smaller and more reserved.<br/><br/>As always, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. Brown grasslands shine with a golden radiance and the light hits just the right angle every time. It's a completely stunning spectacle and camera buffs should see it just for this aspect alone.<br/><br/>The acting is solid across the board. Ian McKellen is Gandalf, there's no question of it. Andy Serkis, in the short time he appears, does his best Gollum yet. Richard Armitage makes a welcome, if a little generic, debut to Middle-Earth as Thorin. The actor who takes the cake, though, is the leader himself, Martin Freeman. Freeman not only fits Ian Holmes's mannerisms and quirks like a glove, but he completely steals every scene he is in. Freeman's comedic timing is dead-on, almost evoking Cary Grant at times, and his emotional scenes prove to be completely convincing. It will not take long for him to reach superstar status.<br/><br/>Now, before I continue to indulge, I have to address some of the flaws, which are relatively minor, but still quite noteworthy. One of the primary reasons Jackson cited for making The Hobbit into a trilogy was to allow content from the Appendices to be shown, but scenes pertaining to this particular storyline felt fleeting and tacked on as an afterthought, only taking up perhaps 20 minutes of the total film. Hopefully, the inevitable Extended Edition will address this (this seems very likely, as trailers, even ones shown after the announcement of the entire trilogy, seemed to show Gandalf in Dol Guldor and battling Thrain, neither of which were included in this theatrical cut; we also see Bilbo viewing the Sword of the King in the first trailer, but that was also seemingly cut).<br/><br/>While on the topic of this side story, I want to address Sylvester McCoy as Radagast the Brown. Some critics have labeled him the Jar Jar Binks of the Middle-Earth series. I want to counter by saying he is everything Jar Jar should have been: very over-the-top comic relief that stays long enough to serve his purpose in the story then get out of the way before becoming a tiresome annoyance. Even his brief appearance would have been off-putting for me had it not been implied in the books that his mannerisms are similar to that portrayed in the film, so I was able to just enjoy a performance that helps color the overall brighter tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Another problem I had was, like many, the CGI orcs. While the orcs from LOTR seemed intimidating and haunting in their unnerving resemblance to humans (humans warped and twisted by ancient evil), the CGI orcs in this movie have lost these attributes. Azog in particular looks and feels very generic and dull, like your typical first-level boss in a sub-standard video game. After giving it some thought, however, I can see why such a decision was made: like I said before, this is more aimed at entire families rather than just ages 13 and up. The movie's lighter tone could have been compromised by some of the most gruesome-looking monstrosities in recent cinematic memory. And given how a lighter tone was the absolute best way to go with this film, I suppose CGI orcs can be considered the lesser of two evils. I don't think, however, toned-down CGI orcs will be as much of a concern in the later two installments. I believe it is safe to assume the trilogy will progressively darken (though hopefully not too much) to eventually match the tone of LOTR, so the orcs are likely to follow suit, especially if early pictures of Azog's son Bolg (who did not appear in this movie) is anything to go by.<br/><br/>If anything, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey manages to actually improve the original trilogy of films. We see a more innocent Middle-Earth, making Sauron's later crimes even worse than they already are. We begin at the halls of an ancient dwarven city being terrorized and conquered by a dragon, before being swept into a world of imagination and wonder, a world shaped by the enchanting and wonderful, before these traits are defiled and ruined by the threat of war and death. This is how future generations will view the Middle-Earth saga: an epic children's fantasy story that slowly ages into an adult-oriented parable about the realities of war, sacrifice and endurance. Because of this, and because I know I'm going out on a pretty thin limb here, I believe it is very possible that Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth series could go down as the greatest film saga in cinematic history, outperforming the likes of The Godfather (the third, and final, film failed) and Star Wars (Return of the Jedi and the prequels flopped). I doubt many, especially for more casual critics and audiences who were expecting the same emotional impact The Return of the King delivered, can realize this at the present time, but when the other two Hobbit films are released and Peter Jackson's six-part Story of Middle-Earth is complete, I believe it just might go down in history as the first (if only) six-part masterpiece."
"jkaufmanazrf","9","5","15","15 December 2012"," 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is a good film and in my mind is receiving to may negative reviews that it dose not deserve.
","First off I have heard a lot about pacing and that the movie is too long. This is true, but not in a bad way. Many critics have criticized the movie's beginning for being too long and that Bilbo takes much longer than needed to get out of the Shire, but I disagree I feel this is one of the strongest parts of the film. You really get to see a hobbits life style, and you get to know your main character Bilbo Baggins. Then the dwarfs come in and you get to know them and what they are like, you begin to understand and connect with their journey Which I might add is important for this and any film. Normally if you don't connect or at least understand your main characters the film sucks. And I feel that the dialogue in this movie is its strongest part and has a lot going for it. <br/><br/>The problem with this film is the pacing, and the action. I think they could of left a lot of the action on the cutting room floor. If it had been just a tad bit shorter, say 10/ 15 minuets I would of given it a much better grade But I believe they had plenty of dialogue scenes that were perfect.<br/><br/>However I cannot stress how well written this film is. My absolute favorite scene in the movie was the one with Gollum, it was pure movie magic. All I have to say on the subject is that the two characters, Martin Freeman(Bilbo)and Any Serkis (Gollum) have great stage chemistry and the animation is the best I have ever seen. It is hilarious when you Gollum's face, and you really love his character. <br/><br/>Now I need to talk about the action, which is good, but too long at points. Now this movie was filmed for 3D. Most 3D films don't make use of it at all, but just by watching it in 2D, I got a feeling that a lot of the action and exploding things would of looked terrific in 3D, and that is why I will watch it again in that format (specifically IMAX). <br/><br/>As for the casting and actors,each brings something to this world and makes it better. You don't really get to know half of the dwarfs but that's all right with me, because I realize having 13 dwarfs in a movie you are not going to be able to learn all about each one. But you do get to know about half of them, and each has his own oddity that makes them unique. Gandalf is amazing, he is emotional, insightful funny and just plain epic all the rest of the time, I am positive nobody else could play that role. Pure perfection. <br/><br/>Some people have compared the character Radagast the brown to the completely stupid brain child of George Lucas, Jar Jar Binks. Which I think is totally unjustifiable. First off you hardly ever see this character, and he actually feeds into the story, of the great middle earth and the begins the fight against evil. <br/><br/>As for the trilogy part of the movies, I now trust Peter Jackson (the director) completely to make the next two films even better by listening to the criticism. Am I like how at the end they give you a little teaser, to (really) really really want to come back for more, all I am going to say is that the ending is very good & very LOTR like. The only really bad part of this film is its length. However I would put it just about equal with the 'Fellowship of the Ring' in my mind."

","I will not review the story because if you are interested you already know it. With one word the film is awesome!<br/><br/>What is new are 3 things: 1. 3D 2. High Frame Rate - 48 frames per second shooting and projection. 3. Shot on video with the Red camera.<br/><br/>The 3D is awesome! I think it add to the movie a lot.<br/><br/>The 48 Frames per second is awesome - no longer you will see annoying flicker and jitter on a moving shots! I still would like to see even faster frame rates as the ideal is 72, which creates the ultimate immersive experience.<br/><br/>My problem is video look (in some scenes)of the film that is sometime very pronounced - especially on the bright scenes. People call this too realistic, I call this to synthetic, plastic and divorced of reality look. It is so because it reminds them of the bad video they shot with their own VHS tape. Too real they say. I say not even close to reality... I fully blame for this the inability of the Red camera to reproduce highlights properly, and its miserable performance with skin tones. Also, because of the video compression and low qantalizalion the tonal gradation has suffered - especially in the more natural scenes. The scenes where they have done heavy, stylized color correction are better.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think it would have been better to shoot on 65mm film for the better look. On the other hand shooting 3D at 48 frames per second with two bulky film cameras might have been impossible, so the compromise of shooting on video. Maybe they had to use a better camera than Red...<br/><br/>Anyway the best way to see it is in HFR, 3D, IMAX."
"alexandruseliscan","Null","5","15","15 December 2012"," A masterpiece!
","It is hard to describe film, because the words are so pour, it is absolute marvelous! I finally felt that the story was coherent, with no gaps like in The Lord Of The Rings.. After 160 minutes man, I wanted more, it felt like the film just began and everything was so immerse that it felt like half an hour or so...<br/><br/>The 3D was very well implemented, man could see that the film was designed in 3D, the only exception was the DOF sometimes; the industry must learn that 3D with out of focus areas is crap, the beauty in 3D is to see all the planes clear and to travel with the view as you like, but this is another story, the all need to learn these things. The good part was the 48 fps which made the image smoother, finally someone is trying to get reed of the crappy 24 fps which gives blurry motion. Most of the critics have no clue what are they talking, 24 fps was a very old technical limitation not something to be desired...STUPID! Some pans and very fast actions in the film cold have been improved on 72 fps on my opinion. The high resolution was welcome, and in conjunction with the higher frame rates made the film so immerse that felt like you are there experiencing the Hobbit. I know it was already very hard to produce the film with 2 cameras, but a perfect film in my opinion who'd have been with 3 cameras. 2 for 3D with large DOF all the time and high fps and he third with small DOF and 24 fps for normal theaters.<br/><br/>Excluding the comments about small DOF in 3D I cold fined only few problems actually. Gandalf's stick in some parts of the film was more like a plastic stick not wood, the poop from the brown wizard hare also, and wooden shield of the young king of the dwarfs certainly looked in some scenes like a piece of plastic. But maybe I to grumbling.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film is a masterpiece, and I'm pretty sure that almost everybody who likes the genre will love it, with the exception of grumpy critics which this time are all wrong in their bad comments about not being a film but more like a TV show, the are so wrong!"
"thornlessjl","9","5","15","15 December 2012"," Peter Jackson has done it again!
","I watched this movie last night at our local cinema. I didn't see it in 48 fps 3d, but it wasn't necessary since the magic of Middle earth doesn't need 3d to feel real. I have always been a huge lotr fan, reading and watching the books/movies since I was a little kid. And I must say that Peter Jacksons interpretation of the hobbit is absolutely perfect. The fact that the movie contained more humour than the lotr trilogy, didn't bother me at all, since the hobbit book is more ""friendlier"" than the lotr book. The cast was great, Gandalf delivered, the dwarfs very funny and interesting, but the highlight was the ""new"" Bilbo, Martin Freeman. He made a big impression and was the perfect actor for the younger Bilbo. Definitely the best movie this year, go see it now!"
"rgkarim","9","5","15","15 December 2012"," My Favorite Of The Middle Earth Tales
","Hello my friends! It's Robbie K back with another review after coming off of a two week dry spell, and what a movie to return to. As many know, this weekend belongs Peter Jackson's newest installment The Hobbit, another tribute to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings world. Now The Hobbit might be one of my favorite fantasy books, so I was very excited to see Jackson taking on the challenge of bringing the Middle Earth to life once more. Yet with his plans to make three movies based on this book, I was worried that Mr. Jackson may have added some extra footage that took away from the movie. So let's get to work as I review The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>With a good book, comes great characters and with great characters come big expectations, and in my opinion, this movie meets those expectations. While the Hobbit has many characters, I have limited space to complement on a few actors that brought the traveling company to life. My first actor to talk about is Martin Freeman, who played the protagonist Bilbo Baggins. Freeman has already had experience portraying legendary characters like Sherlock Holmes' Dr. Watson, and has impressed me with his work in the past. I'm happy to say that Freeman has done his job again, using his natural awkwardness to bring Bilbo's shy and cowardly nature to life on the screen. I felt that Freeman's facial expressions were perhaps the strongest tool in his arsenal, using it to represent the internal emotional struggles Frodo faces in the book, while solidly delivering his lives. The legendary Ian McKellen returns to play Gandalf, using his enchanting voice to bring the wit and wisdom of the wizard out to entertain the masses. Of all the characters, he was the most diverse, as McKellen manages to deliver well timed lines with just enough emphasis to make it funny. Even McKellen's look portrays wizard, as he goes from joking, lovable hermit, to wise and fearless warrior. To finish up the actors section I'll talk about Richard Armitage playing the lead dwarf Thorin. Bringing a hero of the dwarf world to life was no easy feat I'm sure, but the casting crew did a great job picking him for the part. Not only does Armitage have the look of headstrong, proud warrior, but he also has the voice that I pictured the character having. Armitage managed to capture pride, emotional recklessness, and determined nature of dwarf leader, which kept me hooked into the story Jackson was portraying.<br/><br/>However, acting isn't the only strength of this movie. Like many fans, I wondered how Jackson could extend this story into three parts. I feared that like some of his other movies, Jackson was going to put in extra detail that was a dragged out boring mess that was merely used to extend the movie into some obscenely long time. With the Hobbit though, I think he managed to get the balance right, as the extra scenes I saw made the story even more interesting. Though I do not remember everything about the book, the film contained some plot elements that were new to me. Jackson managed to integrate these scenes well, making them key parts of the story that set up more adventure for the later installments. Some of these scenes though are a little tough to understand at this point though, as some of these extra scenes are left unexplained leaving them a little out of place in this movie. Despite these extra scenes though, Jackson did a decent job capturing the immense detail this book contains and in a decent amount of time. Although there is almost a three hour price tag with this film, it didn't feel like I was in the movie for that long. Unlike its predecessors, The Hobbit's pace stays decent moving from one challenge to another quickly, yet making sure to address the backgrounds and plot elements that are necessary. Yet like the book, the beginning is a little slow, with Jackson taking a little too much time on the Baggins home, especially the unneeded Frodo cameo. Yet my friends and I agree, once the quest has started, there are very few lack of a better phrase ""long feeling"" scenes that will bore you out of your mind. I'll go ahead and answer the question of how is the Action? Like the earlier installments, Jackson's crew has gone above and beyond bringing the battle to life. Whether it is flashbacks or troll bashing, this movie had a decent amount of sword swinging, axe smashing, and arrow shooting chaos to open up a new trilogy. Fans will be pleased with the teamwork of the dwarfs, and may appreciate the focus on individual combat styles of the party instead of the clashing army swarm fights many movies like to use. <br/><br/>What else is there to say about the Hobbit? One thing is the camera work, which captures the beautiful wilderness frontier, though a few scenes may cause some motion sickness. The digital art and creation of the various Middle Earth kingdoms was also impressive, as the computer generated lands were stunning. The intricate details of the dwarven halls, the polished finesse of the elven castles, and the rugged waste land of the frontier were all designed to capture the emotion of the scene. Though what are visuals without music? Fear not my friends as the Hobbit has another award winning soundtrack that will take your breath away. <br/><br/>Overall this was my favorite movie of the four Middle Earth films. With great balance, a fantastic pace, beautiful visuals, and some entertaining characters I have no doubt the other two movies will be great. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie in theaters, preferably 2D, and enjoy the world Peter Jackson has created once more. My scores for this film are the following: Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0"
"whatthefaen","10","5","15","15 December 2012"," Fantastic
","I've actually decided to ignore all ""professional"" critiques of the movie and see it and judge for myself. As a big Hobbit/LOTR fan (books) I must say the Hobbit did the book more justice than the LOTR movies did for that book. There were times where the scene was done so well that it actually called back to memory what I have read in the book. It was absolutely spot on, as if they knew what it was I had pictured when reading the book, then filmed it that way. There was virtually no part of the movie that could even be remotely considered boring, as all the actors did a fantastic job and kept it quite lively. I could not be more excited for the next installments, and if you're a fan of the book, give this movie a try, because it certainly did not disappoint at all."

","When I was growing up the lord of the rings was being released and because I was young I didn't really get the full enjoyment out of Lord of the Rings due to the fact I couldn't get into the movie as I didn't understand most of it. So when I heard Peter Jackson was doing the hobbit, for the past year I have been umming and areing if I should actually go and watch this film. But I decided it would be good to go as this is the start of the whole story. And I was completely blown away by this film. It was so good to return to middle earth and now because I am a lot older I could really enjoy the just amazing story and the jaw droppingly beautiful scenery. It is a long film but your money is just so worth it. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is just perfect, he really connects with the character, and I have to say this is one of his best performances ever!

"jpfolch","10","5","15","14 December 2012"," Perfect Movie
","I enjoyed the movie throughout and I find myself with more desire to watch it again than the first time round. I believe having read the book I found it more enjoyable as I knew what to expect before and what to expect form the other movies, yet the new content allows me to have a little of surprise. I watched in 48FPS and 3D, and even though the 3D bothered me (always has), it has been the my most enjoyable 3D experience to date, especially on the last scenes. The 48FPS did not bother me, and I even enjoyed the clarity, however I want to watch it in 24FPS and 2D to be able to compare both experiences. I believe complaints regarding the Hobbit being turned into a trilogy are unfair and unjustified, as the other 2 movies have yet to be released. In addition, having read the book, I believe the other movies have a bigger potential than the first. I also believe it is unfair to attack the movie by claiming it is worse than the LOTR trilogy, as they have different atmosphere, and the movie should be rated on its own. In conclusion great movie - don't let the critics discourage you, the critics are mixed so go to see it yourself and give your own conclusion. My opinion is the movie is just as good as any other LTOR and I desperately look forward to watching it again."
"coastdaze","10","5","15","14 December 2012"," ""An unexpected journey"" indeed!
","As a big fan of the Tolkien Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books, then the LotR movies, frankly I did not hold much hope that The Hobbit would be as good as its predecessor movies. From the movie trailers I had seen, I was not impressed with the actor who plays Bilbo. But I went to see it anyway.<br/><br/>Wow! Peter Jackson does it again. I was transported to that realm that I remember from 10 years ago when I first saw Fellowship of the Ring. I had never seen such a good movie-from-book and was an immediate fan. I've seen them multiple times. The Hobbit is every bit as good and entertaining as the LotR movies. And Martin Freeman IS Bilbo Baggins; I was so wrong in being unimpressed with him in the trailers. And Thorin Oakenshield played by Richard Armitage is spot on. With many of the beloved characters being portrayed by the original actors, it was somewhat of a coming home after a long time. And for me, this point helps with any creative license that Jackson took in straying from the original story. (I don't go to movies based on books to ""see a book"" - I go to see the interpretation of the book. Bottom line, books don't generally make for good movies if taken word-for-word).<br/><br/>The photography/scenery was not as good as the LotR, IMO, for this first installment of The Hobbit but the music, the writing and the acting was so good I still gave it a 10. I'll take the latter over good photography/scenery any day. Jackson has managed to once again, take a fantasy and make it so desirable that one can hardly wait until 2013 and 2014 for the 2nd and final installments. Interestingly, BTW, for me my 3 hours sitting in the theater went by so fast I checked my watch at the end of the movie. A good sign, as I always say."
"LisbonLions","10","5","15","14 December 2012"," Baggines? What is Bagginses?... Precious.
","Since Sir Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, he's created the fantastic (King Kong) and the fantastically awful (The Lovely Bones), and now we're back and it's like we never left. Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel)... they've aged like elves - not a day. Tonally this is breezier than the Lord of the Rings (let's call it LotR) trilogy, but great care has been taken to ensure that it fits seamlessly into the same universe. The same exquisite detail in close-up; the same use of long shots to make the characters tiny in a vast world.<br/><br/>J. R. R. Tolkien's little book concerns a little hobbit, who lives in a hole, who finds himself on a big adventure with a gang of dwarfs, overseen by the wizard Gandalf. Tolkien's dwarfs, seeking an almighty golden hoard hidden under a Lonely Mountain, are closer to Time Bandits than a heroic Fellowship, but Jackson and his co-writers (now including Guillermo del Toro) have shifted their purpose to something more laudable: the reclaiming of their homeland.<br/><br/>In a beautifully crafted opening, after elegantly intersecting with The Fellowship of the Ring, the bumbling dwarfs are introduced to Bilbo and ourselves one by one, as unwelcome visitors to his humble home. They eat, they sing, they talk, and the scene is set. These are the characters we'll follow in almost every scene. The Hobbit is much more linear than LotR; scenes concerning Radagast the Brown (a wonderfully eccentric Sylvester McCoy, channelling the spirit of Tom Bombadil) and Azog (the orcish slayer of Thorin's father, Thrain) are brief asides rather than parallel plots.<br/><br/>So it's all about the dwarfs, and we get to know a few of them well, particularly the bold leader, Thorin (Richard Armitage). He's as close to our Strider, except more reckless, driven by rage, and far less trusting of the titular halfling. As Bilbo Baggins, Martin Freeman is a more subtle performer than Elijah Wood. And he needs to be - a hero as reluctant as Bilbo is a tough sell, but Freeman convincingly depicts a gradual self-realisation: a drive from within, rather than a compulsion from without.<br/><br/>Jackson proves once again that he's the master of combining CGI with human emotion (even though actual humans are conspicuously absent from the story). The scene involving the Storm Giants - living, fighting mountains - is a good example: rather than giving us an omniscient hawk's eye-view of the battle, Jackson focuses on the real drama: the dwarfs and the hobbit, clinging to the giants' knees. And then there's Gollum, arriving for a late cameo. The best chapter in the novel becomes the best scene in the film, with Bilbo and the unlikely keeper of the One Ring riddling in the dark. The special effects might not be technically groundbreaking as they once were, but their integration with real actors remains unsurpassed in cinema.<br/><br/>A couple of issues. Not everyone will get along with the joviality and the slapstick. Once or twice I do feel that certain scenes contain a knowing look too many. (When Gandalf is telepathically communicating with Galadriel, I swear he nods at the audience.) Thankfully, it's consistent, and rarely at the expense of immersion. Also, given what we know, perhaps more could have been done to foreshadow the LotR trilogy - there's certainly room for this in the Rivendell sequence (in which a shabby Gandalf the Grey, in the presence of even greater greatness, looks humbler than we've ever seen him). It's conceivable that an extended cut will provide more references to the impending doom of Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>Given the brevity of the book, what concerned me most was how Jackson could possibly expand the story into the first part of an epic trilogy. The fact that they have, without the film feeling baggy (Bag-Endy?), is, in a sense, an even mightier feat than the adaptation of the LotR novels. It doesn't have the emotional depth of LotR, nor the narrative breadth. It never did. But it has humour and action in droves, along with warmth and intimacy. And it's amazingly good fun - more Jim Henson than Game of Thrones; more Whedon than Nolan. Which is okay by me.<br/><br/>Expect An Unexpected Journey to be condemned as boring and overlong by professional critics (the same critics who probably laud Bela Tarr). Expect it to be dismissed as frivolous and silly. But, more than anything, expect to be entertained by a delightful fantasy film."
"jpachar82","10","5","15","14 December 2012"," Return to Middle Earth
","It's been 9 years since we left Middle Earth, but we never knew that we would ever return to the land of enchantment – the land of dwarfs, elves, wizards and even the littlest of people – hobbits. As the intro to the movie shows us, it shows us what will be and then tells the story of a young, but naive hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He never knew of an adventure until a certain wizard showed up at his doorstep.<br/><br/>But as the movie goes on, we are re-introduced to familiar faces – Elrond, Galadriel, Saurman, and the ultimate villain of the entire series – the ""precious"", the conniving Gollum. All he wants is to live with the one thing that anyone could ever ask for – a long life of misery.<br/><br/>It does not surprise me that Peter Jackson has revisited Middle Earth. It is a place of magic, a place of enchantment. We are just so intertwined into what was originally written by Tolkien and the magic of Jackson – it just makes you want to visit as often as you want.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the biggest movie of 2012 and what a way to end 2012. I can't wait to see what the next 2 installments will bring."
"resident_evilkid","10","5","15","14 December 2012"," Exactly what Peter Jackson said it would be, and more!
","I truly don't understand all the hate for this movie. I know there are intentional haters like die-hard Nolan fans (one of my best friends is a HUGE Nolan fan, but not this intense) who are purposely disliking any other movie this year just to let Dark Knight Rises win awards. There are those who are unaware of Peter Jackson including information from the Appendices in Return of The King as extra material (shouldn't really be news, but some people live under a rock) and say that he's adding material just for $$$ when clearly, Jackson has a huge admiration for Tolkien, and then there are those who prefer fancy art films, which is fine. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like The Dark Knight Rises, and I can appreciate the art films, but when a movie is good, a movie is good. Growing up, The Fellowship of the Ring changed my goals and dreams, and put me on a path to go into film, now, 11 years later, ""An Unexpected Journey"" continues to drive that passion and desire.<br/><br/>I've read the book 1,000 times over (along with LOTR) and what some people don't seem to understand is that it's a CHILDREN'S book. It was written that way. Professor Tolkien went to re-write it to make it more like LOTR in terms of depth and tone, but never did, thus, the Appendices. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson set out to recreate the magical world, with less of a dark and serious tone, and did so, but at the same time, kept some of the things that made LOTR dark. There is light humour throughout the film sure, and I loved every minute of it, but when it's time to get serious, it does exactly that. The battle sequences are intense, and very large in terms of scale. Not one moment of it was boring.<br/><br/>Another thing I don't understand is that people say it's slow? That's called character development. This isn't a mindless action/adventure movie where things just happen to look cool. If it happens, there's a reason for it, for characters to grow, and for us to feel attached to them. For me, it worked.<br/><br/>I went in expecting to appreciate all of the Dwarfs, but not single anyone out. Turns out, I left loving Thorin, Kili, Balin and Bofur the most. Gandalf is still the sly, intelligent wizard he was in the Lord of The Rings trilogy, and Martin Freeman as Bilbo, is perhaps the single greatest casting decision I've ever witnessed. I was worried, I'll admit it, but having seen the film now, he was perfect to play a younger Ian Holm. <br/><br/>The sets are another great aspect. It's all the same. The Shire, Bag End, Rivendell, and even the exterior of Moria (Won't spoil) A new set piece that was amazing was Dale/Erebor (The Lonely Mountain) which was incredible. The CG/Miniatures for all of the sets too work incredibly well, especially with the 48fps 3D, which brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>I saw it in 48fps, and was blown. Away. Entirely. Oh my. I knew it was different, I heard it was bad, and heard it was good. But I like to form my own opinions. 48fps (or HFR, High Frame Rate) makes the 3D work so well, you forget you're even watching a movie. Every inch of Middle Earth was right there in front of me for 2 hours and 44 minutes, and was it ever gorgeous. I know people aren't fond of it, but for The Hobbit to be the first movie done in 48fps and to look that good, and then to improve on it, is incredible. I really don't know if I could watch this at 24 now because of how much I loved the 48 experience.<br/><br/>The CG wasn't bad either, the HFR adds to it, making it smooth, and less noticeable as CG, which was amazing. The score? Well, it's Howard Shore, so it's obvious that it was perfect for the film. <br/><br/>All in all, if you enjoyed LOTR, you will most likely enjoy The Hobbit. I'm off to my second viewing in a few hours, and it certainly won't be my last before it leaves theatres."
"ynqve","9","5","15","14 December 2012"," Exceeds expectations
","As a huge Tolkien fan, it was with mixed fear and excitement that I went to see the Hobbit: an unexpected journey, last night. I was really worried about how Jackson was going to extend the Hobbit into three films. But in retrospect, there was no reason to worry at all! There is not a dull moment in the entire film. <br/><br/>The story is not as dark as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it still have the same feel to it. You do feel like you're back in the same Middle-earth as before, but things are not yet as grim and desperate as in the old films. Some people might complain about there being too much comedy and slapstick but you need to remember that the Hobbit was written as a children's book. I like the fact that they expand upon some story lines that does not have the same weight in the book, such as the white council and some of the issues between dwarfs and elves, but it still remain true to the original story. Obviously the film is visually stunning and the 3d and 48 fps work really well. <br/><br/>I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to the next part!"
"aleemislegolas","10","5","15","13 December 2012"," the hobbit review
","I'm not going to say much. Just that the film is beautiful. the cg are fantastic. the action sequences are brilliant. the story is clear and leaves no confusion. it starts slow then it gets better. WATCH IT IN HFR! ITS WORTH IT! it makes you feel like you are really in the movie. I know people are saying that the 48 fps makes the cg look fake. trust me it does not. the animation is in fact smoother and fight scenes look well polished and not like some cheap close shots of 3d animated fights with lots of motion blur. The audio also blends well with the film. the music played are all appropriate based on the setting of the scenes. This film is the best film i've seen in 2012 and have no regrets in watching it in imax hfr 3d. i will definitely watch it again and again."
"bergh-simen","8","5","15","11 December 2012"," An unexpected visual
","Just saw the Hobbit: an unexpected Journey. Most amazing visually and cinematic experience. Almost real in 48 fps which did take me 10 minutes to get used to but after that blew me away. Don't compare this to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Just like the book it is not meant to be compared. Of course some parts where a bit long and it felt like it ""ended"" three times, but the movie left me with a stomach feeling that I haven't felt before and the feeling was good. Going to see it again most definitively. As a fan you will get everything and more, you will most likely love it from start to finish and even after credits. None fans will probably think it is to long but yet entertaining or they might hate it all together. It is a adventure fantasy film and based on a children's book, which Lord of the Rings isn't."
"hrw4","9","4","11","29 December 2012"," Bilbo is the Reason
","This is a good movie; no, this is a great movie. Quite simply, it is better than any of the LOTRs movies. The reason for this is Bilbo Baggins.<br/><br/>You can take both Frodo and Sam's personalities multiply them by 30 and you will never get close to the charm of Bilbo Baggins. And this is saying a lot, as I am a huge Sean Astin fan. From Goonies, to White Water Summer to Rudy, Sean never disappoints. And he did not in the LOTR, but Bilbo is just a better character. <br/><br/>And in Peter Jackson's latest adaptation of the Hobbit, Bilbo shined. Martin Freeman was definitely a good choice for the role of the brave Bilbo Baggins. The complexity of the character will surely be shown<br/><br/>I highly suggest you see the Hobbit in IMAX 3D and take in a large tub of popcorn, as it is almost 3 hours long."
"kcorcomp","6","4","11","28 December 2012"," An uncomfortable journey
","Let me use the standard preface... I am a die hard Tolkien fan, and I loved the previous LOTR films. I still love the story, I'm not a fan of this film. <br/><br/>The RED cameras shooting a massive 48fps made for hyper realistic filming which I felt was rather awkward for a fantasy film. I found action scenes video gamesque, while close ups had an almost doco feel. The picture quality was so refined it served to highlight any 'flaws' (which ordinarily would be unseen)- the makeup and costuming (wig seaming). <br/><br/>Sweeping scenery reminiscent of the previous films is again breathtaking, but this time is in stark  contrast to the humanness of the actors. I felt pulled in and out of the world, never immersed enough to forget I was in a theater. <br/><br/>For the positives- the score was amazing, at one point I closed my eyes and listened, possibly the most enjoyable part of the experience for me, second only to the Gollum scene. Andy Serkis brilliantly brought to life Gollum, emotive and complex, and by far the most well received scene/s of the film. <br/><br/>It is worth a watch, but perhaps the technology is too advanced for this old tale? <br/><br/>A wonderful story, but a long 3 hours lacking the authenticity I expected."
"cyifly-2","9","4","11","28 December 2012"," Wow... What An Unexpected Ride
","Having never read the book, I didn't know what to expect next. Having read so many reviews, I did't either. Lot's of reviews were down right negative, calling the movie boring and long. Others called it a masterpiece. After being exhausted leaving the theatre, I lean towards the latter.<br/><br/>If you find this movie boring, I think you need to go have your pulse checked. Either that, or you have just been desensitized from other things. It's extremely entertaining, full of action and even a bit scary quite a few times. There were a few parts - very few - that kind of dragged. But what movie doesn't. For most of the movie, it is edge-of-your-seat entertainment. There are great battle scenes, fantastic characters, seamless special effects and beautiful cinematography. The 3D depth is incredible and the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Yes -- There are a few points to the story that could have gone quicker, but they were necessary parts to the story. If they were cut out altogether, the story would not make sense and you would be in constant sensory overload from all the action. There is so much action, your brain literally will need to take a break. Don't let reviews that pound that fact keep you from going to see it. I almost did and I'm glad my wife steered me away from those people to form my own opinion. I hate sitting in a movie that is deathly slow and overly long for no reason. This isn't one of those.<br/><br/>As I said, I never read the book so I can't tell you if it followed exactly like the book. And, to be honest, I don't care if it did or not. Even if there wasn't a book, this is a brilliant, fun movie experience. I haven't been this entertained since Avatar.<br/><br/>I think if you have the means, pony up and pay for the big screen (IMAX, XD, etc.) and the 3D. This not just a film... It's an experience and the screen, sound, and 3D makes it so. I saw it in HFR (High Film Rate) and can't tell you if that made a difference because I'd have to see it again without it to tell you. But if you can, see it with that too. You might as well go for it all, right? I would absolutely go see it again. The characters' voices are a little hard to understand at times (and I think at important times) and would like to get more of the plot.<br/><br/>Bottom Line -- Go see it. It's not really for little kids, even though everyone says it's a 'Kids' Book.' It's quite scary. But most adults or teens would enjoy it. I went in with low expectations because of the user reviews I read here at IMDb, and was pleasantly surprised."
"Sandy-99","10","4","11","21 December 2012"," A perfect adaptation of a great story
","An absolutely stunning fantasy adventure. I was enthralled from start to finish. Does it help to know the book, and the mythical background? Maybe, but I can't unknow it, whereas those ignorant of the story of how (and why) a wizard calls in on a homely hobbit to persuade him to go on a quest, have a choice.<br/><br/>Great though the Lord of the Rings movies were, Jackson and his team have created a more complete fantasy world than was possible 10 years ago, and populated it with humour and humanity. As was the case with the last trilogy, the actors make a great ensemble, with enough strong performances to carry the story without any of them overwhelming. Where previously the studios were wary of making audiences sit through long movies, Jackson can here take his time, not just in expanding (not padding) the original tale with additional material that helps stitch the entire of Middle Earth into existence, but in allowing critical scenes time to unfold and draw you in.<br/><br/>The action sequences are just mesmerising. Knowing that they are created with 'special effects' does not matter if you allow yourself the pleasure of wallowing in the details and being carried breathlessly through the backstory of the loss of the dwarfs' home of Erebor, and the fights with trolls, wargs and goblins.<br/><br/>But the two most telling moments - proof that within this oft derided genre are the essentials of what story is about - are the most quiet. The scene where Bilbo and Gollum meet under the mountain for the first time climaxes with the critical moment for the whole of Middle Earth where the hobbit, hiding from Gollum, who is in turn hiding from the dwarfs, has the chance to kill the pathetic creature from whom he has obtained the ring. He changes his mind. But the most affecting moment for me came after the rumbustious goings-on when the dwarfs first arrive, and Bilbo wakes to find they have tidied up and gone, leaving him to his ordinary life. The silence ringing round Bag End is terrifying, and it is this realisation that he has lost his chance to live a real life that compels Bilbo to change his mind once more, and propel him out of the door.<br/><br/>Now, to find a cinema where I can watch it again, this time in 48fps and 3D!"
"tom-verheyleweghen-559-95694","9","4","11","20 December 2012"," I'll be there and back again!
","I don't understand much of the criticism of movie critics and the reviewers on IMDb. They complain that the movie takes too long to get going. They apparently expected a non-stop action driven movie. Not even the epic LOTR movies were non-stop action and tended to slow down a lot (for instance the ending of ROTK was very long stretched). I don't mind the tempo of the hobbit. In fact, I enjoy the prologue to get back into the world of Middle Earth. Another criticism is the new technology of the HFR 3D. I saw the movie in this format and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't like all the critics claimed. It didn't disturb me at all. The length and the stretching of the story was also not to the liking of many viewers. Peter Jackson didn't change anything to the story but simply added a few subplots. As I see it, Peter Jackson is a genius of modern filmmaking. Not only does he succeed to bring us back to middle-earth, but he is completely consistent in doing so. When finished, the 6 Middle-Earth movies will be completely in line with each other and Peter will have gifted the world with what I truly believe is the single most magnificent fantasy adventure ever brought to the screen. I don't mind criticism if it is just, but in this case it's simply not. Do I need to remind everybody that Jackson succeeds where countless directors have failed. Think about it. Lucas destroyed Star Wars by making the prequels; Spielberg destroyed Indiana Jones by introducing aliens to the series; Ridley Scott makes a totally irrelevant prequel to Alien. The least one can say is that Jackson stays true to himself and to his vision. The Middle-Earth he created (to me) is just a great place to be in. I hope he doesn't listen to the critics and finishes the next two movies just the way he always planned. He can count on me. I'll be there and back again!"
"urawb","9","4","11","19 December 2012"," Remember the day you saw The Hobbit at 48fps...
","This my is my first ever review and is mainly about my experience with the new HFR (48fps)<br/><br/>First, please don't go into this movie looking for a LOTR prequel movie, this is Peter Jackson's version of the book, The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. This is Peter Jackson taking a children's book (a somewhat short book at that) and adapting to the big screen for adults and teenagers, this is not easy to do. There is plenty in this movie to satisfy LOTR fans; I actually like the fact that PJ has taken his time to develop the story and introduce us to the characters (I wish more movies did this)<br/><br/>Second, if you have read the book, The Hobbit, don't expect it to follow the book, throw that out of your mind, you are going to see a movie not to see a audio book. As a historian, I never get upset at Hollywood for their version of history (JKF by Oliver Stone was a great movie but horrible with the facts of history).<br/><br/>With that said, this was a great movie experience, I went and saw this movie in an IMAX theater 3D HFR (please note the day you saw The Hobbit in 48fps) I can only tell you that I am joyfully spoiled now, I don't want to ever see another movie in the traditional 24fps. I watched all the previews in 3D 24fps but when The Hobbit came on, well... let's just say I was blown away by it's stunning detailed, no soap opera look for me but a sharp clarity and cleanliness; a color and vividness I have never seen in a movie. The cinematography is what you expect from a PJ film, but in HFR the characters, the deep vistas and sweeping landscapes, made you feel like you where there in the scene especially with the dwarfs in the fast pace action scenes (I actually could see all thirteen dwarfs inside the Goblin cave, on the bridge running and fighting in great detail, no blurring for a change). I will have to admit, in the first scenes of the movie, it did look like Bilbo Baggins was moving a bit too fast, like 1.5x speed on your DVD player but soon your eyes adjust and you can't see it anymore even if you tried. <br/><br/>This will change the way we see movies, it will be like VHS (24fps) or Blu-ray (48fps) which one should I choose. Not really a choice...<br/><br/>I hear the next Avatar movie is going be an HFR movie, I hope so and many more movies to follow."

Every race has a voice in the music presented. From the somber tones of the dwarf songs to the happy go lucky melody of the habits.

"dwitman15","10","4","11","17 December 2012"," A Stunning Piece of Art
","Peter Jackson once again proves his aptitude for making films, and in particular the works of Tolkien. The cinematography was stunning, the acting (especially by Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis) was impeccable, and the story was exhilarating. For all the moviegoers who will enter the theater expecting to see another Lord of the Rings film, I can tell you right now you will be greatly disappointed, for the Hobbit reigns in a new feel of middle earth, one based on creatures, comedy, and cinematography. Not only does Jackson succeed in portraying the characters of a new Middle-Earth film, but he proves his ability to adapt to a completely and totally new style of literature. There are no ring wraiths, no groundbreaking betrayals, and no evil dark lords. Instead, a group of trolls, a pack of hungry wargs, and a comedic looking goblin king fill the screen. The scale of The Hobbit, which is reflective of the book, is reduced from that of Lord of the Rings. One quest bore the weight of the world and the other derived itself from a Hobbit's unavoidable desire for adventure.<br/><br/>Many criticized Jackson for butchering the Lord of the Rings (I personally do not, having read the series twice I think he did an incredible job portraying Frodo's journey). Those critics, who believed he left out key parts, are sure to enjoy the detail, accuracy, and precision of the film, which even incorporated new characters and parts to make the three movies flow with more connectivity.<br/><br/>I would be remiss if I wrote a review about the Hobbit and didn't speak directly to the scene dubbed ""riddles in the dark"". The acting between Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman here is nothing short of stunning. It is quite possibly one of the best scenes I have ever seen captured on film and undoubtedly the best performance capture excerpt in any movie. A second scene which measures close in stature occurs in Bag End, when the dwarfs sing ""The Misty Mountains Cold"" by the fire.<br/><br/>Go see the movie, it is nothing if not a stunning piece of art. Bound to make you hate Jackson for one thing--not releasing the next film for a whole year."
"Hellmant","10","4","11","15 December 2012"," A far better prequel than the one George Lucas is famous for!
","'THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The first part of the much anticipated film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic 1937 book. Like 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film series it's directed by Peter Jackson and written by Jackson and his usual writing partners Fran Walsh (Jackson's wife) and Philippa Boyens. This one is also co-written by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who was originally set to direct the films but bowed out after too many delays and filming complications). Like 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film adaptations 'THE HOBBIT' film series was originally set to be divided into two films but Jackson was later given the green light (by producers) to make three films instead. He says he didn't realize it had to be three films until going over all the film footage and realizing there was too much for just two movies (but I find this hard to believe). The first chapter 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' plays out too concisely as a complete and individual film (with a nice climax) to have just happened that way (at the last second, by accident). Some fans had a problem with Jackson stretching and dividing the material out into three films but I was all for it as long as he could make each chapter a satisfying film on it's own (with a good climax for each) and at least with this first film he seems to have done that!<br/><br/>The films are a prequel to 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' series (although the book was written and published prior to 'The Lord Of The Rings' book trilogy). Martin Freeman (of 'THE OFFICE' fame, the original British version) stars as the young Bilbo Baggins (and Ian Holm reprises the role, from the 'RINGS' trilogy, in his older years). Also returning from the prior films are Ian McKellen (once again as Gandalf), Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis (as the motion capture produced Gollum, once again). The film begins the legendary story with Bilbo being picked by the wizard 'Gandalf the Grey' to join a team of thirteen dwarfs, lead by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a mission to take back their kingdom from a vicious dragon named Smaug (who stole it years earlier due to it's mass collection of gold). Bilbo is picked for his burglar skills even though he has none and this becomes apparent to the dwarfs who quickly find him useless. Bilbo finds himself in way over his head and wanting to return home when he stumbles across 'the ring' and steals it from the creature known as Gollum. <br/><br/>The movie has been criticized for it's length and pace but I found it to be no slower moving than any of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' films (except perhaps the last one) and even a little more amusing. Of course it's too long and drawn out (and perhaps too faithful to the written material) but so were the other films. It's usually not a good thing to try and cram everything from a book into it's film adaptation (and then some in this case) but when it's such a labor of love for the filmmakers and they're that passionate about the material (and giving the die-hard fans what they want to see) it can't all be a bad thing. I only read the book once, as a kid, and don't remember it all too well so I can't remember what entirely is the same and what has been changed but that makes me a better critic of the film as just a film, in my opinion (and not in comparison to the material it's based on). I'm not married to the material at all and had no high expectations for the film adaptation, so I was pleasantly surprised. It's visually spectacular and I did see it in 3D (although not in the new 48 frames per second it was filmed in, there's no theaters near me with the capabilities of showing it that way). The performances are all good (especially Freeman and the scene stealing Serkis) and Jackson's directing is once again beautiful and perfectly fitting. I did find it to be just as entertaining as the other films in the series but it does lack the emotional depth that made 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' films truly great films. While it might not be quite as classic as the great trilogy it follows it's still a magnificent achievement and a far better initial prequel than the one that George Lucas is famous for.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NILhScQxII"

The second time I watched the film was in 3D HFR and I was very impressed with the quality of the picture as well as the 3D effects. I also picked up on many things I did not notice the first time I watched the movie. I agree that the movie is much different from the book as is the case in most all movie adaptions of books. As I am a huge fan of Tolkien's books I was a little disappointed not to see some of my favorite parts of the book in the movie. I would have loved to see more interaction with the eagles. Peter Jackson, cast and crews did an excellent job! I thought the movie was Amazing and will enjoy watching this for years to come and can't wait to see The Desolation of Smaug! I also cannot wait to get the sound track for the film!"

","An Absolute Stunner!I have always been a great fan of Tolkien's works and Peter Jackson has so far done an excellent job in adapting his books. The effects were awesome,the acting was top notch and the pace of the story was superb.The action scenes were intense and kept me at the edge of my seat. The soundtrack was awesome.I have read the book.At first i kept wondering what was the point of making 3 movies for a book which isn't even one-third of the LOTR saga.The movie cleared all my doubts as the best part about the movie was that not a single detail was left out. This very much justifies the making of three parts. My suggestion to all fans and non fans of the LOTR universe is to go and watch it.The movie of the year for me.i give it 10 out of 10."

","The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey is a wondrous film adaptation of the beloved book, faithfully brought to life and lovingly enriched by Peter Jackson and his troupe. It is thoroughly enjoyable, I can see myself re-watching it many times.<br/><br/>This is a film especially appreciated by fans of Jackson's LOTR films. Having thoroughly enjoyed the LOTR trilogy and the extended edition content, I rejoiced when I heard that The Hobbit was going to be expanded into a 3-part epic. I wasn't sure how Jackson was going to do it, but I knew it was the right move.<br/><br/>And after watching the first installment of The Hobbit trilogy, I now understand what Jackson is doing. It's an absolute joy to see more of the Middle Earth universe brought into The Hobbit, even if it seems tangential to the main story. The result is that we are immersed in a more expansive world.<br/><br/>The tone of The Hobbit differs from the LOTR trilogy; it is much more lighthearted. This movie is not about saving the world from imminent doom, it's about kinship and helping friends reclaim their rightful home. As a result, there isn't - and there shouldn't be - the same level of gravitas as the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a whimsical adventure through the fantastic land of Middle Earth. It is almost one-dimensionally an adventure movie, and needs to be accepted as such. The movie should be looked at as a fun jaunt through a fantastic universe, which is really what we get.<br/><br/>However, we do get more than this. The characters Thorin and Bilbo are established very well and we come to know and respect these characters. We get an unexpected moment towards the end where the stubborn Thorin apologizes for doubting Bilbo's competence and truly accepts him as their burglar. Here we get a really great theme of friendship that is truly heartfelt.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair not to list a few things I would have done differently:<br/><br/><ul><li>The scene where the dwarfs almost magically stack up Bilbo's tableware is absurd.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The dwarfs are surprisingly resilient to long falls and being crushed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The usual gripes I have with Jackson's disorienting camera style, jerky pacing, and out-of-place horror themes.</li></ul><br/><br/>However these are minor gripes.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey lives up to my expectations and is worthy of the source material. Both instill in us that love for adventure and the pursuit of finding out what's over the next hill."
"Rlipt8","9","4","11","16 December 2012"," Astonishing visual experience but several major disappointments.
","I have read many of the reviews here, some written with the finite appreciation and esoteric knowledge of not only the 3 Peter Jackson projects but of all the works of Tolkien. I have read all the books, and have seen LOTR, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King so many times because it fulfilled for me what I always wanted in a fantasy movie, which is realism. Film it for adults and it will work for all.<br/><br/>I could not wait to see The Hobbit and I made sure I was one of the first to see it. I sat patiently and was mesmerized by the color, 3-D, the lush view of the Shire, the dwarf mines and all the rest.<br/><br/>Then when it came to the Trolls, I was aghast at the departure from the reality of all the other Peter Jackson masterpieces. The clunky, goofy, three stooges buffoonery displayed by the supposedly terrifying creatures they were supposed to be, started to ruin the entire movie and sense of make believe reality of a fantasy world for me. It was not funny, it was a disaster to choose that direction, to gear it toward the entertainment of a child. It lost me with disappointment from that moment I was so disgusted that they chose to do that. I finally got back into it.<br/><br/>The wonderful unforgettable scenes of beauty of Rivendale, Galadriel and Elrond were wonderful, the ferocious wolves were terrific, yet the white Orc as evil and formidable as he looked seemed more like a CG orc. I liked his white wolf, he was stupendous.<br/><br/>Then the ultimate disappointment which I still cannot believe was put into this movie. The Goblin king instead of being a murdering evil embodiment of danger, was a journey into Jabba the Hut meets the Frog King. Whoever chose to do that should never be allowed to work on a Peter Jackson LOTR movie again including Peter Jackson. The voice, dialog choices for the Goblin King were all a bad clown show that destroyed the image of being in the clutches of supposedly dangerous creatures. Utter disaster.<br/><br/>The devout fans of the LOTR trilogy with me were so disgusted with the comedic approach to that character there was no longer a sense of real danger there, only of watching a very bad Star Wars bar scene on another planet with special effects by a Saturday morning cartoon show.<br/><br/>Just horrible to see terrifying Goblins attack the group only to be brought before a cartoon clown. God that was a horrible mistake. Keep it real like you always did Peter PLEASE.<br/><br/>The courage of Bilbo attacking the CG albino Orc was inspiring as was Bilbo's speech afterward and the warm embrace by Thorin. Very touching.<br/><br/>The color, the clarity, the other special effects were enjoyed at the highest level of appreciation for Mr. Jackson's genius. I still rate the movie as a visual experience and for bringing back our favorite subject with much hard work and grace, a 9.<br/><br/>When Margaret Hamilton the Wicked Witch of the West is more scary than anyone in a 2012 Middle Earth Movie, with Orcs, Goblins, Trolls and other wonderful monsters it is time to remove the clunky comedy approach."

","I have read the book and was expecting a very similar experience and storyline as the book was however they seemed to have taken it another direction. Although the Hobbit is supposed to center around Bilbo Baggins, this movie really attempts to connect itself with the LOTR series, making this a real prequel. There were a lot of parts that were added and changed but I can understand why it had to be done, the Hobbit did not have as many defining moments as did LOTR. Overall I enjoyed the film, it was like a treat for the fans, as a fan myself I felt giddy when I saw the reappearance of Frodo, and Gollum. LOTR will still be much more epic, but the Hobbit holds its own."
"joelguyt","8","4","11","15 December 2012"," Worth it - Short and Simple
","I'll try to keep this short and simple, not going into great detail, starting with the good stuff: The effort put into making this film has definitely paid off. The LOTR quality is ever so present in The Hobbit as well. The casting is brilliant, and of course Ian McKellen absolutely steals the spotlight with the character only he could portray :) And now I've seen Martin Freeman as Bilbo, I don't actually think they could have found someone better too.<br/><br/>The music score is fantastic, absolutely no step down from LOTR. The graphics have also greatly improved, but this also has a down side, as I'll discuss later.<br/><br/>There are merely a few ""down point"" for me. Firstly, this film seems more ""childish"" than LOTR; there is much more humour and silliness in the film, sometimes in particular scenes where the sincerity of the situation becomes undone as a result of a joke. I didn't think that was suitable.<br/><br/>Also, Jackson has used wide CGI shots with hordes of goblins where the action seems a bit too ""fantastic"". Sometimes there's just too much going on; swords swing through the air and miraculously hit dozens of goblins within seconds. Entire constructions fall down ravines with the dwarfs on them and they land perfectly safe amidst clouds falling planks and splinters.<br/><br/>Please note though, I have not read the book in years so I can't say whether Jackson's approach in this is true to the book or not.<br/><br/>All in all I definitely felt this film deserved a lesser rating than LOTR, but its an absolute must see nonetheless. If you liked LOTR you'll certainly like The Hobbit also."
"martinpersson97","10","2","4","23 July 2019"," True to the book, whilst maintaining the feel from The Lord of the Rings
","Peter Jackson made marvelous work adapting J.R.R. Tolkiens fantasy masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, and when The Hobbit was announced, who better to direct the adaptation of Tolkien's original story?<br/><br/>The novel is one I hold very dear. It has sort of this cozy and warm feeling surrounding it, telling a relatively small adventure story for children. With that, Tolkien laid the foundation for all fantasy that has come since.<br/><br/>Did Jackson manage to recreate the magic of that book, as well as follow up his cinematic masterpiece trilogy? The answer to both of the questions are an absolute: Yes.<br/><br/>The events in the novel are perfectly adapted and strengthens the feeling of the pages coming alive for this feature presentation, and the child-like feeling from the novel is there to be found as well; many of the songs and jokes from the novel are adapted fashionably, without making it feel out of place compared to the rest of the film - for Jackson did not simply seek out to make a direct adaptation of the book, oh no. This film also cleverly makes it clear how it takes place in the same universe as his previous Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Beside the feeling of child-like wonder and small adventures stands a more serious film, with the fate of the world at stakes, and with more of the universe established since the writing of the novel, one are also able to incorporate familiar faces from other parts of the Middle-Earth universe.<br/><br/>The acting and characters are great, Martin Freeman sells it as Bilbo, and really feels like a younger version of Ian Holm's character, and Richard Armitage is very much compelling as the stern and hard dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield. McKellen is great as always in the role of Gandalf the Wizard and has some fantastic quotes in this movie as well.<br/><br/>Once again, the CGI is breathtaking, and combined with the practical effects, it really sells the sense of Middle-Earth being real.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic movie, which conveys the feel found in the novel, as well as bringing its own ideas into the fold."
"erikoksman","9","2","4","19 January 2019"," A fun time
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is truly a great adventure movie that is, along with the two other movies in the trilogy, unfortunately often compared to the three greatest movies of its genre (LOTR). While this movie has its issues I feel like its still a great time and a welcome addition to the Middle-Earth movies.<br/><br/>First, let's get the negatives out of the way. This movies relies very heavily on CGI. The CGI does stand out but even though I would prefer the minimal use of CGI, the CGI used for certain characters and animals in the film doesn't look bad per se, it just gives it a more ""childish"" or less serious tone. I don't mind having this less-darker feel to a movie that is based off of a book mainly written for children. The use of CGI instead of real locations in many instances has claimed a lot of criticism but I must say the CGI used for creating locations is very well done and I can't really fathom the often drawn parallers to the Star Wars prequels when it comes to CGI for crafting locations.<br/><br/>Another ""issue"" with this film is its runtime. At almost 3 hours, the film does feel a bit too long for me. The film could have easily been cut shorter thus some sequences feeling drawn out or just out of place. The film spends a lot of time in Shire which is totally fine by me because that way we can get to know the main characters of our story better. However, I feel like the scenes featuring Radagast the Brown in the forest feel a little bit out of place because even though the scenes are important to the overall plot, they are not too important for the plot of this movie.<br/><br/>A lot of criticism has also been given to the personalities of the dwarwes or should I say the lack of. Yes, even though we spend practically the whole movie with the dwarwes we still barely even remember their names. I truly feel like this was an issue that couldn't really be avoided in a ""The Hobbit"" movie no matter the director. I feel like Peter Jackson, the actors performing the dwarwes and the costume artists, make-up artists etc. do a reallt good job in bringing life to those characters. We learn small things about the dwarwes and get an idea of some of their personality traits.<br/><br/>Then to the main positives.<br/><br/>The score of this film is absolutely magnificent. The sound design in general is along with the visuals (in all fairness that's what you expect from a movie with this sort of budget.)<br/><br/>The acting. Martin Freeman is the perfect Bilbo and when I read through some of the other possibilities for Bilbos role, I am truly happy Martin Freeman was the choice. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is obviously a major positive. There is something so wonderfully soothing about his line delivery. I would also like to point out Richard Armitage as Thorin.<br/><br/>There is a lot of comedy in this film and even though I enjoyed most of it there are a few VERY odd lines here and there. Also the whole breakout from the goblincave sequence is done in a very humorous and over the top fashion. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie didn't take itself too seriously. However, a major criticism from my part is that straight after the goblincave sequence there is a very intense and serious sequence where it seems like all hope is lost. I don't have an issue with either of these sequences themselves but I just wish that the pacing would have been different at this point. The escape from the goblincave sequence was a lot of fun but it also took quite a lot of momentum away from the movie. I feel like the scene at the cliff would have been even better if there was a littlebit of breathing time in between.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel like this is a great movie with some minor issues. That is why I will give it a solid 8,7 rounded up to 9."

"Quinoa1984","7","2","4","21 December 2014"," overlong, stuffed the gills, occasionally truly, unabashedly great
","Originally Guillermo del Toro was supposed to direct the Hobbit series. Whether he had two or three films at the time he was in pre-production is uncertain, but he still retains a co-writing credit on the scripts. His presence, I think, can be most felt in this film, An Unexpected Journey, which also takes the most from JRR Tolkien's original book of the title. His sense of grandeur and love for creatures - unique, big, small, darker and more disgusting and 'out-there', the better, which I'm sure jived with Peter Jackson's tastes - is there big and large here, and it helps in moments... and perhaps detracts in others when things go on, and on, and on.<br/><br/>Now that the trilogy is complete, I can look back on this first film and see that there was actually a lot that was good about it, at least in the sense of kicking off this new series of films starring that Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, arguably the reason if nothing else to see the movie as it's a tremendous performance for all of the little moments and gestures he gets right). Bilbo is a stubborn little guy, though not as much as the dwarfs who crash his house to eat and inform him - via Gandalf the Grey and Thorin Oakenshield, a son of a departed king - that he is to go on a journey to help them get back their gold and kingdom from a diabolical dragon named Smaug.<br/><br/>Of course, this was originally a children's book - not three separate ones like LOTR, just one, and the first version was not as complex as it later became with rewrites and reissues - and here it gets puffed up to unimaginable heights. Though shortened and imperfect, a 1977 animated film got the whole story in under 90 minutes. Ironic that Jackson's 'Rings' series was the best criticism of the Bakshi adaptation, where now it's reversed. His film is loaded with action and adventure, some of it well choreographed, scary, exciting, deranged, and just... long. And, as with a lot of franchises (including Star Wars) things have to tie together, even if inorganically. Hence you get appearances from Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchett (albeit as actors they're never unwelcome, just sad it's this dragging material) as characters not in the book, only to serve as connecting tissue for the ""Larger"" threat that is really in the background of a tale of a little hobbit and the dwarfs.<br/><br/>The film is the definition of hit or miss, and when it misses, such as an overbearing climax that just feels too BIG for its britches, giving a massive dose of epic battle to something that isn't that big, it's a lot to bear. But when it hits, I hasten to say it was almost (not quite, but almost) worth it for Jackson to come back to this series. The highlight above all else is Bilbo's 'Riddles in the Dark' with Gollum. Though the visual effects were astonishing and groundbreaking with him years ago, here they've gotten *better* and, in just once scene, we get so much from this character all over again - a showstopper, naturally for Andy Serkis in the best possible way, playing it for comedy, tragedy, horror, everything you dig about this character - that it's a reminder how much character is paramount in these types of films. You can have all the sweeping shots of New Zealand and characters running this way and that and CGI monsters and peril... but two people having a conflict over a piece of gold is much, much more intriguing.<br/><br/>Indeed that one scene is a 10/10. But there's too much 'filler', so to speak, scenes that drag and characters who either have too much backstory (Thorin, the a-hole of the series and the kind of co-protagonist with Bilbo) or not enough. I enjoyed Unexpected Journey, maybe, just barely, the most out of all these new releases. But the lack of a consistent tone - some things played for much broader comedy than anything in Lord of the Rings, some things so dark that they nearly become comical, and action that feels like it's still going even after the movie ends - I don't know. It's a film where you can feel brilliance and mediocrity fighting one another."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","4","26 November 2014"," ""The Hobbit"" doesn't live up the the Middle earth phenomenon, even with a 48 frames per second camera.
","Nearly a decade after Peter Jackson finished making the final film in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (arguably the greatest three films put on film), Jackson adapts yet another Tokein novel called ""The Hobbit."" Jackson being a businessman decided to make three films out of this book. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" isn't nearly sophisticated enough as ""The Lord of the Rings."" We start off with the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, writing about his adventure to Frodo. The majestic wizard, Gandalf, seeks Bilbo to venture out into the rigorous terrain of Middle Earth with 13 dwarfs to take home the dwarf kingdom known as Erebor. Bilbo gives in, leaving us in a world of fantasy. Not only does this film lack Jackson's spectacular directing of Middle earth, but not one visual element here is strong. ""The Lord of The Rings"" has some of the greatest CGI in history. ""The Hobbit"" looks like an animated kids film most of the time. Some scenes even look like drawings! The scenery isn't breathtaking at all, almost impossible to not recognize the green screen affect. With so many unique creatures, it's sad to see lame CGI. Fantasy films often get stereotyped in a good way for having elaborate costumes. The costumes look like something out of a school play. ""The Lord of the Rings"" did a perfect job making the story intelligent and brilliant. Jackson adapted the trilogy to add intensity and artistic talent. Here, were stuck with annoying humor and almost childish entertainment. He tries to make the scenes as long as he can, knowing he has to make two more films. He overdoes the fantasy element without adding any beauty of rich brilliance relating to different worlds. The only creature that provides any fun is the mesmerizing Gollum. Still looking the same, Gollum comes out of nowhere for a sequence you won't forget. With ugly orcs, viscous wolves, and stupid talking trolls, it's fresh to see a familiar face. Jackson does do a good job giving us exposition and a backstory without boring us. He also packs in a lot of action that is better than seeing any of these obnoxious singing dwarfs. With Gandalf as the main lead here, we see him save the day all the time and Bilbo as more of a supporting character. ""The Hobbit"" has great scenes in the book. I don't understand why Jackson didn't make the story into a beautiful 3-hour film with groundbreaking visual appeal. Instead, he went for the money and starts off with one childish, overly-involved, self-acclaimed disappointment."
"kgprophet","6","2","4","17 May 2013"," Subpar to the Nearly Perfect Original Trilogy
","There are two separate things I want to touch upon in this review. First is how it feels to return to Middle Earth and sit through yet another epic 2 hour 50 minute journey. The other is my reaction to watching a ""film"" in HFR (48 frames per second). I have not read the Tolkien novels, and didn't find that a problem when watching the original LOTR Trilogy. First of all, it was pleasant to feel that I was watching a production that was in good hands. The pacing (except for about two spots) was energetic, the dialogue and acting successfully avoiding cliché. The period of time spent with Bilbo reluctantly setting off on an adventure was drawn out way too long. I'm sure it is verbatim to the novel, but is obvious that a lot of this slow story development would have been streamlined with a more agreeable running time in mind (save it for the special DVD release). Not being familiar with the novel, I was finding myself being whisked along for the ride (once it gets started). There is intelligence in the creatures they encounter, and consistent backstory with all the elves and dwarfs and orcs and so on. <br/><br/>There are a few more extended dialogue scenes, that on a normally disciplined running time, would have been trimmed to avoid the dullness of exposition. <br/><br/>As much as I was mildly interested in this prequel for the content, I was more eager to witness what may be the birth of a new era in film presentation. Digital theatres will sometimes feature programming shot and presented in video (Metropolitan Opera for instance), with a totally different look. For the first time since silent movies changed from 15 frames per second to 24, there is a new barrier being broken. Video runs at 30 frames per second, so this new 48 frame format bests even the 'live' look of normal video as compared to the look of film. I took a survey of movie reviews to find out the reaction to the HFR showing. Most of the reviews were negative. The look of video has a stigmatism to it, as 'cheaper' looking compared to film. To be sure, lighting as seen on video is generally more harsh than film, where film is known to have better contrast, the ability to see detail in shadows. <br/><br/>I must declare that there was a moment of surprise as the movement and detail were much more crisp that any movie I have ever watched, even animation displayed on an Imax screen. Yes, the higher frame rate looks like video. But every other aspect of the image looked exactly like the same production style and depth as LOTR. More impressively, 90% of the digital effects held up to close scrutiny with the clearer image. There were the following few exceptions. The most major hindrance was the look of the sets that were supposed to be rock or sculpted stone. I guess because having seen the making of documentaries, I know that most of the fake rock is made of styrofoam. Also a sequence where digital wolves are running across the wilderness. I'm sure it was a challenging effects shot because of a moving camera along with moving digital animals in daytime combined with live action. Some of the background did not match in resolution to some CGI, but was forgivable. The look of video only became apparent during shaky hand-held shots. However, my mind's initial interpretation of watching this type of movement in a fantasy environment, was as if I was watching a high quality video game. <br/><br/>It has become a real issue, because audiences need to be given more jaw dropping effects every summer as the bar continues to be set higher, with video games following close behind. One thing that is the most revealing technically with HFR is the lighting. For instance, I could notice the artificial light replacing the supposed candlelight on a table. There also is the perfectly lit miniature of a mountain or a foot bridge with the main characters seen from a distance. But they may not look any better in the standard 24 fps. <br/><br/>So congratulations are in order for both the story and technical achievements as we extend our stay in Middle Earth. The filmmakers did not forget that one their primary jobs for these kinds of films is to make sure the audience is entertained. And entertained I was. <br/><br/>Further notes summing up my first viewing of an HFR movie<br/><br/>PROS Eye-popping clarity, incredible detail especially in wide shots. 3D benefits from brighter and more cleaner image CGI characters are more lifelike, but still only as good as the quality of the CGI<br/><br/>CONS Video look. Slower fps provides the film look. In higher fps, Animation looks like video game animation. Extra sharp resolution makes it easier to spot characters shot against green screen<br/><br/>REACTIONS TO OTHER COMMENTS ""Some action looks sped up"" - I did not notice anything like that, perhaps they are used a bit more motion blur, or can't handle some fast motions without strobe. ""Notice costumes, make-up, and wigs"". I was actually amazed how all the production design held up under such intimate scrutiny. ""Soap opera, BBC television, stage play"". These are all mental associations that these viewers make when first witnessing a narrative feature that doesn't have that film look. But it is not because of the lower quality of the production. <br/><br/>Update: I finally watched the film on DVD in 24 fps. All the effects in 48 frames that looked iffy looked just as fake in 24 frames. So ultimately that is a strike against the effects work for this film, especially to the almost seamless effects work in the original LOTR trilogy."
"mfredenburg","7","2","4","19 March 2013"," The Hobbit trys to be something it's not.
","The Hobbit is a really good book, the Lord of the Rings is a much better book. LOTR is truly an Epic adventure having to do with the fate of all of Middle Earth. The Hobbit is an adventure about dwarfs trying to reclaim their home, their treasure and also kill a dragon. A nice big fun adventure, but not really Epic and not really on anywhere near the scale of LOTR. <br/><br/>Having read LOTR multiple times I felt that Peter Jackson truly captured the feeling and spirit of the book. Yes, there are some things I disagreed with in his movie adaption, but on the whole the movies were an amazing achievement.<br/><br/>Relatively speaking, Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Hobbit falls way short of what he was able to accomplish with LOTR. Jackson's efforts to make the Hobbit more epic are severely undercut by giving the action sequences a video game quality. In the Hobbit you are bombarded with too many scenes and actions sequences that strain credulity. <br/><br/>Sadly, the action sequences in the Hobbit film that take away from the experience were not even in the book. Further, the film's efforts to be ""Epic"" by making the Hobbit longer results in extended action sequences and extra plot elements that really take away from the story. <br/><br/>The result is a film adaptation that fails to capture the magic of the book that it is based on. <br/><br/>In the end the film adaptation of the Hobbit falls victim to a movie studio trying to recreate the financial success of LOTR by trying to artificially pump the Hobbit up into three really long films and it just doesn't really work.<br/><br/>Does this mean that the first of the three Hobbit films is is a bad film? No it is a pretty good film, but make no mistake that the Hobbit is not even in the same league as the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>I give the Hobbit a 7 because it is a fun film with good special effects. If I were grading it strictly on being a good film adaptation of the Hobbit I would drop it to a 5."
"DrTuvok","8","0","0","14 May 2020"," Peter Jackson's over-the-top, bombastic return
","It really isn't as bad as people say-and the worst aspects of it are actually not Peter Jackson's fault, it's Guillermo del Toro's for abruptly leaving after pre-production started, leaving Jackson to desperately pick up the pieces. Another reason to not like del Toro after the headache-inducing Pacific Rim, the perverse Shape of Water, and the gruesome agenda-fueled Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a fair warning it doesn't fit in at all with the Lord of the Rings movies tonally but no one really expected it to. This movie is beyond goofy; it feels almost like 80s slapstick in parts, yet every action scene is so over the top and theatrical you can feel Peter Jackson desperately trying to throw you backwards over your seat. Better yet, the pervasive humor somehow lacks the snarky postmodernism that is plaguing so many blockbusters today. The result is an actually quite unique and unhinged blockbuster that doesn't really feel like anything that came before it. I actually appreciated this go-for-broke zaniness, it saved the film from being really boring like all those other fantasy slogs set in derivative worlds. (Or in anything directed by David Yates. Peter Jackson can out-direct him any minute of the week.)<br/><br/>Breakdown:<br/><br/>Bilbo's birthday party is long, but then you realize that Jackson is lavishly following the book, and you can't deny that these scenes are entertaining. If you want battles and bloodshed you will just have to wait and sit through this Middle-Earth sitcom.<br/><br/>They leave and we get introduced to the CGI Azog in a flashback. Don't worry, he isn't the worst CGI this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>They meet some 'toxic trolls' who want to eat them. This scene is an extension of the Middle-Earth sitcom theme and is so ridiculous you'll probably laugh It has a very cult-movie like feel, like Army of Darkness or something. These types of scenes are what make this oddity of a movie so unique.<br/><br/>We meet Radagast, a kooky animal-loving wizard who is so stressed out by evil forces that Gandalf gives him some pot to calm down. Or something. (Again, laugh!). Azog's scouts attack and they escape to Rivendell to meet Agent Smith. Watch the extended edition to see the naked dwarves swimming in the fountain. Take that, Warcraft!<br/><br/>Then they travel to the mountains, some of which look and act like Transformers, until they get captured by goblins. This is where Jackson unveils his true loony self, with a goblin rock band, the icky blobby Goblin King, more absurd somewhat twisted humor (especially in the extended one), and an eventual chase scene that crams in all the Three Stooges gags he can think of. The goblin city is actually really well-designed and creativity abounds in all these scenes. If this wasn't based off a book it would warrant a much higher rating for imagination.<br/><br/>Bilbo meets Gollum and has a riddle contest. Pretty well done, the lighting is fantastic and the set looks pretty real.<br/><br/>Anyway, they escape the goblins only to be attacked by Azog and blindingly bad CGI that looks on the same level as Attack of the Clones. This entire fight scene is only saved by the part where Thorin goes out to fight Azog in slow-motion with the most bombastic soundtrack imaginable playing. Try finding a scene like that in any other modern fantasy movie.<br/><br/>Then they get saved by 8-bit graphic eagles and the movie ends. Bring on the next ones."

","The Lord of the Rings trilogy was absolutely epic and still holds up to this day and after waiting years for a Hobbit movie to tell the story of Bilbo's epic journey across Middle Earth that sees him slay a dragon save a dwarfen kingdom and discover the one ring that was thought lost to all and finally in 2012 we got the first part or a new trilogy starring the hobbit that started it all but looking back how does it hold up?.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey stars (Martin Freeman) as Bilbo Bagins of the shire a quiet unadventurous hobbit who gets roped into helping a band of Dwarfs reclaim their fallen kingdom from a feirce dragon named Smaug. Along with Gandalf the grey played masterfully once again by (Ian McKellen) they travel across Middle Earth braving dangers of all sizes from trolls to orcs with a band of Dwarfs and their king who is the last of his blood line and has one chance to retake his kingdom at any cost.<br/><br/>The movie is on par with the original Lord of the Rings trilogy although this is more of a new adaptation of the original book but it's still very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson returns to direct the movie and brings with him his unique vision that made the original trilogy look and feel breathtaking.<br/><br/>The acting from all involved is well played and on point especially (Martin Freeman) and (Ian McKellen) who are fantastic in their roles as Bilbo and Gandalf.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the original Hobbit book and The Lord of the Rings books and movies this movie is a brilliant adaptation of a timeless story I also recommend watching the extended version of the film while it is three hours long it adds is all cut and deleted scenes back into the movie making it the full experience possible."

","Like all JRR Tolkien movies Peter Jackson did, this one is a masterpiece. From the music to the casting to the action scenes, just brilliant.
The Hobbit was one of, possibly the first real novel I ever read as a kid, so needless to say, high expectations.
Was this movie 100% true to the book? No. But I do believe it captured the essence of what Tolkien was trying to get across - that sometimes the seemingly ordinary and unimpressive is exactly the opposite of what you think.
Could the casting have been any better for this movie? Ian McKellan perfectly played Gandalf and Martin Freeman was equally perfect as Bilbo, while the dwarves were much harder to materialize in your imagination reading the books were brilliantly brought to life in the movie.
I just can't say enough good about this and all the Peter Jackson movies. So often when they make a movie out of a book I love, they completely ruin it. How wonderful to have a movie meet the expectations."

","Peter Jackson Middle Earth franchise spawned two movie franchises that were based on JJR Tolkien novels ""The Lord of the Rings"", and ""The Hobbit"". Jackson ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy in particular was a smash hit with audiences, and is now considered to be one of the greatest film trilogies ever made. The reception of ""The Hobbit"" franchise was more divisive, but was still overall a success. I wanted to do reviews for Peter Jackson version of Middle Earth for quite some time, and that time has finally come. I wanted to start off with ""The Hobbit"" films first, due to their reception, and to see how events from these films continue in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. So let's get started. This is The Middle Earth Saga Retrospective.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is directed by Peter Jackson, and stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage. A reluctant hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, sets out to the Lonely Mountain with a spirited group of dwarves to reclaim their mountain home - and the gold within it - from the dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>I found the first installment of the trilogy to be entertaining and satisfying experience. It certainly lives up to be an unexpected journey. I was surprised at how expansive the film scope was. The main cast of characters go through various locations and meet many faces, some friends, and others foe. I felt there was a real sense of urgency and tension that they had to go through, some of that taking place within the group, as their courage and strength are tested throughout. The relationships that Bilbo himself with Gandalf, the wizard that aids Bilbo and Thorin, the leader of the dwarves to be one of my favorite aspects of the film, as I felt them to be believable, and provided great character development for each of them, and that not even adding the amazing work provided by the actors, but I get to that later.<br/><br/>However, it goes without saying that while I did truly felt that I was part of an adventure, that leads to the pacing, which I'm actually mixed about. Peter Jackson is in no rush to tell this story, as the film stays in the The Shire until after the 45 minute arc. Some scenes do feel they start to drag slightly as the film felt like it had be grand and epic in order to make it to nearly three hours. Strangely tough, on further re-watches, the pacing has become less of an issue for me personally. I remember being surprised that when I check on the time while watching the film again for this review, it was past the 2 hour mark, meaning that I didn't feel the need to check my watch up until that point. I think that because instead of focusing on the running time, I began to look for nuances that the film had, whether it be the character interactions, or absorbing the atmosphere and the world building. I still feel the film is slow, but I grow to appreciate it. I see how people can have a more negative reaction to it, but I think that television has done good things for me over these past few years.<br/><br/>The characters are overall great. Bilbo is a fantastic lead, as he is presented with a relatable struggle. Should he stay in the safety of The Shire, but not see the world and leave a legacy, or do the opposite, but risk losing your life in the process. As the film goes on, he builds his courage and truly becomes a hero in his own right. It also helps that Martin Freeman is amazing in the role, with expert delivery of his lines, and subtle mannerisms that makes Bilbo such a wonderful protagonist. Ian McKellen is still brilliant in his reprising role of Gandalf from ""The Lord of the Rings"", once again showing his wise, and kind nature, but also his skills in battle, and the mighty power the character holds. Richard Armitage as Throrin is great at being stoic when he leads his fellow dwarves into battle or the great unknown, but is able to show brilliantly the tormented soul that lies within, making his arc much more heartfelt.<br/><br/>The main players of this tale are also supported with a fantastic supporting cast, with actors such as James Nesbitt, Ken Stott, Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis on the top of their game. Serkis in particular in his returning role as Gollum, has my favorite scene in the whole film with his game of riddles with Bilbo. The atmosphere is unsettling, and the chemistry shared by Freeman and Serkis is spot-on. Plus the riddles themselves are actually quite clever, and the underlaying tension builds until it snaps like a guitar string.<br/><br/>As great as the cast is though, I felt a few of the characters were a bit underwritten. Greatly acted not doubt, but I wish there was more meat to their personalities. Some of the dwarves came in my mind, and while there is definitely variety to their quips, I wish there was some screen time to show their personalities fully. However, I did buy the feeling of brotherhood and union that they shared, and I did care for their struggle. So it's more of a minor problem rather than something that ruins the film. Azog, the film's main villain was fine, but I did had issues with how he was done. I wish there was more time to flesh out his personality. Granted, there are scenes that do just that, but I kinda wanted the film to go get inside the character and see more aspects of the character. He not a bad villain though, as he is a legit threat to the main characters, and does have understandable motivations for his actions. I guess I just wanted more than what was given, but he does the job well enough.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, I can't really complain about much. Sure, there is more use of CGI, and it is obvious at points when it is that, but it is well detailed and I felt fit within the film's context. I don't want that though for me to overlook everything else. The sets are beautiful, there is a sharp attention to detail of the costumes and sets. Peter Jackson direction is incredible, knowing how to make moments feel more intimate, and create scenes that feel epic. He had a love for this project and it shows in every frame and angle. The score by Howard Shore is first rate. The music can be calm, and relaxing, and then be grand, and exciting. All of it just works.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" does suffer from it's pacing issue, a somewhat overlong running time, and some slightly underwritten characters. However, more often than not, it made a great return to the Middle Earth universe with it's fun and heartfelt narrative, an amazing performances, and nearly perfect production values. It is a flawed, but ambitious project that manages to get me hyped for it's upcoming sequels."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first movie in the Hobbit movie series. The movie is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. The story follows Bilbo Baggins, played by Martin Freeman, who becomes involved in an adventure. A group of Dwarves organized by Gandalf the Grey stay at Bilbo's home and bring him into a quest to reclaim their Dwarven home.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a different movie and series from The Lord of the Rings. This movie is for one a movie with a wider scope and different intended audience. The movie is based on the book of the same name by JRR Tolkien. The book is wrtten for a younger audience and that is reflected in the screenplay. The characters are more light hearted and there are no large scale battles. The movie focuses on the character dynamic between Gandalf, Bilbo, and the Dwarves. These interactions are where the movie does best because they are new and unfamiliar to the audience. The discussions the characters have are memorable.<br/><br/>The movie features 48 frames per second that was shown in select theaters. This feature should be avoided by most audiences. Some of my audience members could not handle the frame rate and had to stop watching. For the audience members that could bear with it, the experience can be positive. The 48 frames per second can contribute to that feeling of the fantastical. The movie's effects look much slicker in this frame rate. This technological feature of the movie does not however make up for its shortcomings.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has many plot deficiencies. Most of it comes from the movie being too bloated. The decision to split the adaptation of the book into multiple parts allows the audience to see more of Middle Earth. However, this costs the movie in pacing. This is a slow movie. Even by the Lord of the Rings extended cut standards, the theatrical cut at The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has lots of superfluous scenes. There is an entire subplot with the necromancer that is explored and it ultimately leads to something the audiences know from watching The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Even if the movie's pacing is slowed due to the bloat, the rest of the movie is of high quality. Peter Jackson does a fine job with Middle Earth. Visiting this world is recommended.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","The mountainous terrain, increasingly dark and menacing as the story progresses, at times resembles paintings by John Martin and Caspar David Friedrich, and is beautifully photographed by Jackson's regular cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie, who has that feeling for landscape that's such a feature of antipodean cinema. At the centre of the film, and sensitively handled by Jackson, are the relationships between Bilbo, his gruff mentor Gandalf and his antagonist Thorin, and it's something children will respond to. In his book Anatomy of Criticism, the Canadian literary theorist Herman Northrop Frye makes a distinction between ""high mimetic"" and ""low mimetic"" figures, ie heroes who are mythically and socially superior to ordinary people or at the same human level as the rest of us. Gandalf, who teaches Bilbo what heroism is, and Thorin, who exhibits the necessary qualities in his actions, are high mimetic figures, while Bilbo is low mimetic. Bilbo can become a hero and then return to his former world, as indeed is suggested at the beginning of The Hobbit. What we see in Martin Freeman's moving and endearing performance is Bilbo doing just that. I liked the film and its measured pace and, except when I found myself looking over the top of my glasses, was largely unaware of the 3D. You also love it"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","23 October 2018"," Not a classic but a welcome return to Middle Earth
","For those who aren't aware, the Hobbit movies are the prequels to the tremendously successful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. While the original trilogy was based on a massive three-volume novel, the novel upon which the Hobbit movies are based is comparatively slim. Nevertheless, the studios involved managed to stretch this content out to three films spanning a combined total of 462 minutes. The term ""cash grab"" definitely comes to mind.<br/><br/>That being said, with ""Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson returning to helm this trilogy, the endeavour wasn't purely motivated by profit. Jackson treats Tolkien's source material with respect and his intentions probably had more to do with fleshing out the story than with artificially inflating the overall runtime. Really, the studios would have been foolish to place arbitrary restrictions on what was pretty much a guaranteed hit. Still, I can't help but wonder if a more condensed version of the story would've yielded better results.<br/><br/>In any case, this time around the hero of the story is Bilbo Baggins, who (like Frodo in ""The Lord of the Rings"") is a rather reserved Hobbit who has adventure thrust upon him. In this chapter of the story, he's called upon to act as a burglar for a group of dwarves who are trying to reclaim their ancestral mountain home from the clutches of a vicious dragon. Naturally, Bilbo is reluctant to accept at first but he eventually relents and joins the group on their quest.<br/><br/>Apart from Peter Jackson, there are some other welcome links to the original trilogy. Chief among those is Ian McKellen, who reprised his Oscar-nominated role as Gandalf. That wasn't all, though. Other returning cast members included Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Andy Serkis, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving & Christopher Lee. Having all of these familiar faces around really helps to establish the movie as an extension of the ones that preceded it. The new cast members are numerous, though I don't really think that there are too many standouts. I will say, however, that Martin Freeman makes a very good Bilbo Baggins, so at least the movie has that going for it.<br/><br/>With Jackson in the director's chair again you pretty much know what to expect. The movie unsurprisingly has a very familiar feel, which is a good thing. This extends to areas of the production like screenwriting, cinematography & music, all of which were at least partially handled by returning crew members. Basically, if you liked the epic feel of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy then here's more of the same. There's a bit more of a lighthearted feel this time around, though, which probably isn't surprising considering that ""The Hobbit"" was technically written for children. Be that as it may, this movie adaptation is serious enough when the plot requires it.<br/><br/>All in all, this first Hobbit movie is a pretty good bridge from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I certainly wouldn't call it a classic but it is a worthwhile and enjoyable return to the same world. These movies definitely turned out a lot better than the Star Wars prequels, though that isn't really saying much. Like the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I think that the middle entry is the weakest but the beginning & final chapters make the overall effort worth it."

No one expected this from Peter Jackson, whose films before and since have left little to rave about. There were scenes where I felt Jackson was resting on his laurels, not wanting to do a second take, while there were other scenes which left me breathless.<br/><br/>In case you didn't realize it, this is a prequel to LOTR. In this story a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) joins Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the slobbish Dwarves regain their mountain taken by a dragon. In this episode, Bilbo acquires his sword ""Sting"" and ""The Ring."" They do not reach the mountain.<br/><br/>Gandalf appears to be our only source for truisms and memorable lines. ""Your house is now behind you, the world is ahead."" or ""Evil will always look for a foothold in the world"" or ""True courage is not knowing when to take a life, but when to spare one."" This written with WWII in the mind of Tolkien. I couldn't help but think of the dragon as Germany or of the Elves appeasement philosophy that the world was at peace while battles raged on.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman has a very strong British accent, unlike the other Hobbits. Initially I thought his character was a weak link, similar to Elijah Wood as Frodo. He grew stronger in his role as the film progressed, although I am not convinced he was the best choice.<br/><br/>Sylvester McCoy plays Radagast, the Brown.

","Manny's Movie Musings: ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" has a young, Bilbo (Martin Freeman) reluctantly going off on a great adventure with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a bunch of dwarfs to reclaim the home and treasure of said dwarfs. The problems: a giant, bodybuilder orc is after the leader of the dwarfs, and he isn't alone; the trek is a long way off and filled with enemies big and small; and the dwarfs' home/treasure are guarded by a dragon that can incinerate armies. My most memorable, movie moment of this first part of the trilogy: the riddle challenge scene between Bilbo and Gollum. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" unexpectedly did not live up to the standards ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy had established. The music is good, the special effects are amazing, the scenery is incrediblebut the characters areeh. Freeman, McKellenno problems there. But the majority of the dwarfs are forgettable and irritating. Except for the king dwarf and the old dude dwarf, they were filthy and disgusting creatures, like teeny Klingons. I really didn't give a damn whether they lived or died or got their home and treasure back. To make things worse, most of the dwarfs were introduced so fast it's hard to tell many of them apart, and virtually no time was given to get to know most of them. If it wasn't for Freeman and McKellen being part of the group, I would've rooted for the dragon to incinerate them all.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

In several scenes the dwarfs are near death and most surely going to die and bam all of the sudden they are fighting back and winning against all odds. Many of the special effects are way beyond belief to actually be able to happen. I know this is a fantasy but they need to scale back the CGI a little. I kept saying to myself WOW this looks great but its unrealistic. Other movies with CGI are doing the same thing. How about less CGI and more acting with emotions. This is why this movie did not win an Oscar. At least the CGI was very detailed and life like. Yes spend the money to make the special effects as great as possible but in a realistic possible way. I saw the movie as special effect scene after special effect scene with some actors acting edited between them. I still like the movie but it could have been much better."

","After having dazzled audiences with the LotR trilogy many years ago, Jackson and co. reunite to tackle Tolkien's The Hobbit, detailing Bilbo's adventures prior to the events of The Lord of the Rings. Young Bilbo is enjoying his simple Hobbit-life, when all of a sudden Gandalf appears and claims to seek someone ""to share in an adventure."" Bilbo is not interested, but that same night thirteen dwarfs arrive at his doorstep. We learn they seek to take back one of their lost kingdoms, Erebor, which was stolen from the dwarfs by the dragon Smaug. Their plan to take it back requires a non-dwarf (since Smaug is used to the smell of dwarfs) to act as a burglar. At first, Bilbo is uneager to accept with the high chances of being eviscerated, lacerated and incinerated. The next morning Bilbo discovers the dwarfs are gone and that he cannot resist to urge to go an adventure. Thus begin Bilbo and company's not-so-unexpected journey to Erebor which will of course include many dangers <br/><br/>While we expected returning to Middle Earth would be thrilling, many issues become apparent when we take off the rose-colored glasses, one of them being the film's length. Whereas the decision to go from two to three films when filming The Lord of The Rings is an obvious one given that the novels are about 1600 pages long, The Hobbit on the other hand is only about 300 pages long. The amount of skepticism before this film's release is precisely because it was announced that instead of having two films, The Hobbit would also be turned into a trilogy. This raised questions whether The Hobbit would be too spread outand unfortunately it is. I've seen it two times and especially the second time, the first half of the film was considerably harder to bear. The fact that The Hobbit is more considered to be a children's novel becomes more apparent with the time spent on minor detours and makes me pine for the gravitas of the LOTR trilogy. Things pick up speed in the superior second half with the highlight being Bilbo's encounter with Gollum/Smeagol.<br/><br/>The spread out nature of the film is reflected in its story, or rather its lack of story. The amount of character development is minor. Save for Bilbo suddenly deciding to join Thorin and Gandalf, Bilbo feeling homesick, Thorin having to overcome his dwarven pride by requesting the aid of elves, the revenge subplot with Thorin and Azog, I can't help but feel that the amount of story development is minimal. Surprisingly, I experienced a kind of 'fuzzy' feeling whenever 'old' characters from the LOTR trilogy appeared. Though it was already known that characters like Frodo would reappear, the feeling of 'nostalgia' was still surprising and I couldn't help but smile when Frodo popped up all of a sudden. Speaking of characters, that is also a definite weakness in The Hobbit: the dwarfs. Although we spend most of our time traversing Middle Earth with these dwarfs, we only really get to know two of them: Thorin and Balin. The others, though visually distinguishable, remain a tad indistinct.<br/><br/>One cannot review The Hobbit without discussing the use of 3D and 48 fps. I haven't seen the 'normal' version so I can't compare, but there were upsides and downsides. There were moments where I felt more immersed into Middle Earth, butbecause the 48 fps and 3D version creates the expectation of experiencing something 'as real as life', the moments where the CGI looks fake stand out like a sore thumb even more, undermining Jackson's intention: ""For me it gives it the sense of reality, and makes you feel like you're leaving the cinema and entering somewhere new"" (christianpost.com). Case in point: the scene where Radagast the Brown escapes a pack of Warg scouts by sled.<br/><br/>This scene brings me to another issue with 3D: the shock when something approaches the camera rapidly. For me, this contrasts with the very goal of 3D in The Hobbit: to immerse yourself in Middle Earth. When something suddenly approaches the camera (a Warg or an arrow), I'm thinking less about the fate of the main characters and becoming more aware of the fact that I'm watching a film. There was also the issue of light. Although the image wasn't darkened like other 3D films (The Last Airbender), I found that scenes including large sources of light (like a setting sun) automatically created the stretches of light one sees when squinting one's eyes. This affected the area between the edges of the 3D glasses and the edges of the screen, again making me adjust my way of looking at the screen and more aware that I'm watching a film. Then again, the 3D does create some memorable images such as when one of the eagles flies towards Thorin, lying close to the camera, and picks him up. Here, the way the eagle approaches the camera is beautifully enhanced by the use of 3D.<br/><br/>It was great to hear Howard Shore returning to Middle Earth once again. Besides showcasing new themes (such as those for Gandalf and Erebor), Shore also made numerous references to his LOTR themes, some of which were very brief. For example: when Saruman suddenly appears at Rivendell, Shore reprises his industrial theme for Isengard in a smooth, less obviously evil manner, foreshadowing Saruman's 'turn to the dark side'.<br/><br/>All in all, I find it to be unfair to judge this first part on its own merits since the story is so spread out, even though this was a conscious decision. Once part two and three are released we will be able to judge these films as one whole experience. Until then, this first outing is definitely not as bad as I feared, but worse than I'd hoped."

","The feeling I got from leaving the cinema after watching this prequel was vaguely reminiscent of the feeling from watching the Star Wars prequels. The difference between those two experiences was that The Hobbit was not actually a bad movie. The reminiscence I felt was the same level of high expectation coming in, and the same level of morbid un-satisfaction I felt upon leaving the cinema three hours later.<br/><br/>To make it absolutely clear, it's not objectively bad. My distaste for it is entirely based on the source material it represents, not it's credibility as a stand-alone work of film production. The film is definitely enjoyable which is why I gave it a 6/10. To give credit where it's due, I will at first mention the things the movie does well.<br/><br/>The most obvious thing the film has going for it, is the visuals. While the CGI use is a bit overbearing (on which I will elaborate on when discussing the film's faults), the wide, sweeping landscape shots of the New Zealand setting warmly invite die-hard fans back into Middle Earth. I didn't see it in 48FPS so I reserve no right to talk about what most of the internet is relaying as a terrible idea, but it deserves mention that 48FPS is now an option. <br/><br/>You also get to witness some amazing set-pieces in Middle Earth that you had already seen in Lord of The Rings, but have now been reformatted for higher definition and quality.<br/><br/>There are some fairly decent performances from this cast. Martin Freeman pays a lot of respect to Tolkien's Bilbo Baggins from the book, and performs him as almost a reflection of audience reaction. He responds and behaves the way perhaps quite a few people in the audience would react in this crazy adventure he's been persuaded into. This makes the character relatable, but not intriguing. <br/><br/>However, the real star of the show is Andy Serkins. He only appears in one long scene, but his rendition of the wretched Gollum is even more frightening and riveting as it was in The Lord of The Rings.<br/><br/>Some of the fight scenes are enjoyable, and there is a reasonable amount of humor in the film. However, this concludes the list of things I liked.<br/><br/>To start off, splitting this story into three parts was a silly move (or brilliant if you view it from a business perspective.) The Lord of The Rings was collectively a 1112 page story that was so densely packed with content that the extended film editions barely came any close to accounting for it all. The Hobbit is 500 page story, dilute of complexity, in which a hobbit and a company of dwarfs embark on a quest. Splitting it into three installments causes serious padding and pacing issues. The parts of the movie that abuse this the most are the first 45 minutes and everything to do with Radagast the Brown. <br/><br/>The Hobbit has lost something that the LOTR trilogy used extremely well: realism. Even in a trilogy of fantastical races uniting against a tyrannical demon lord, the combat was believable, the armour was based off authentic medieval chain-mail design, and the supernatural elements were shrouded in subtlety. Although there were magic and creatures,there wasn't a great deal of it due to the focus on the series being the brotherhood between enemies in the face of war. Right from the prologue, The Hobbit missed this point. Everything looks so digital now, the dwarf kingdom was ludicrously designed, and the combat was so unrealistic the audience was likely to be torn between taking it seriously or not. Sometimes it was child friendly, sometimes it was horrifically violent. No wonder Martin Freeman always looks confused.<br/><br/>However, the biggest issue has to be the liberties taken with the source material, though I can't discuss those on this review. All in all, The Hobbit is a misguided attempt as a film following the incredible LOTR trilogy, but a success as a visual achievement and a piece of entertainment."
"blowfly13","6","0","0","13 October 2013"," more bad than good, but A+s for Tim and Thorin
","I mostly gave this movie the rating I did because Tim from The Office (British version) was GREAT, and Thorin was hot (and so were a few other less important dwarfs). And I always love Gollum. Other than that, there was not much to recommend this movie. Negatives:<br/><br/><ul><li>3 hours to get only halfway through. - Lots of made up situations and people who were not in the book. Usual writer arrogance in thinking they can improve on authors like Tolkien. - Bilbo transformed from a very clever guy who got the dwarfs out of scrapes using his brain to a guy who charges a huge monster to save Thorin. - A scene with Cate Blanchett posing and talking so slowly she sounds like she's on mega doses of Xanax. The pompousness was off the charts. And basically she was saying to Gandalf, how ya doing? and he was saying, eh, I'm old, and so are you, but still you look pretty good. The worse thing with this director is how SERIOUSLY he takes the whole hobbit thing. Lighten up, guy. - Totally made up bad guy. - Overlong scene of the dwarfs coming to Bilbo's house in the beginning, and overlong exposition of Thorin fighting with the made up bad guy. - Overlong scenes of one frantic thing happening after another. My husband said he felt like he was watching Speed. - People falling down huge crevices in sheer rock and barely even picking up a bruise. No broken bones. No death. Ridiculous. - The ring falling onto Bilbo's finger from the air above. I could throw a ring in the air 9000 times and it would never once fall around any of my fingers. - Incredibly long - 3 hours and we're only HALFWAY THROUGH? Compare these bad things to the extreme positives of (1) Tim from The Office and (2) hotness of Thorin and a few subsidiary dwarfs, and you'll be surprised my rating was a 6. But those two things were good enough alone to merit that rating.</li></ul>"

","3D-48fps, before i get into the review i have to say i am a LOTR fan and rate the trilogy in my personal top 10, as such i was really looking forward to this release. first lets get the bad stuff out of the way, the 48fps is certainly pin sharp but the contrast and lighting give the film a very non cinematic TV like appearance, while some may like this personally i like cinema to look like cinema and not like watching 1080p at home. the cgi camera pan's really were almost video game like, and unnatural this created a disconnect between wheat was going on, on-screen and the viewer. the superhuman survival of the dwarf's during several scenes was just ridiculous and i did not feel that the group were in any kind of peril, emotionally you want to at least feel like there is a risk (even though we've all read the book and know the outcome). the movie was just too long, i mean there is a great amount of detail, but lets be honest there has to be as the director and the studio need to stretch out a simple 300page book into almost 9hrs of cinema. this was a commercial decision to milk the audience over 2 years and 3 movies rather than giving us what could have been a fantastic single 3hr movie the scenes with gollum really showed off the latest CGI tech and were jaw droppingly awesome.<br/><br/>all in all fairly enjoyable, but disappointing all the same. i certainly wont be going to see it again and i wont be queuing up for the DVD release (followed no doubt by 6 special edition DVD box sets)"
"DICK STEEL","10","7","24","15 December 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
","Peter Jackson again took some liberties with the narrative that may irk the purists around us. Some may deem it serious departures from Tolkien's intent and sequence, such as the party's capture by three Trolls amongst others, but I suppose for a film to move things along, and translate effectively from print to screen, these decisions had to be done, in addition to coming up with story-arcs that ups the ante for action, since the first third of the book didn't have much to boast of. But these changes were judiciously applied and I thought effective for the film to gather and introduce a little more background and material, to show how expansive Tolkien's universe actually was, and set to get larger when all the completed films get put together.<br/><br/>What also worked was Jackson's filling of the gaps each time Gandalf disappears in the story, which in the film was a reason to re-assemble thespians such as Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee and Hugo Weaving to reprise their roles, in what would be another over-arching sub plot that sounds out the mysterious developments in Middle Earth revolving around a necromancer, that I'm sure many fans would appreciate additional easter eggs pointing to what's to come. Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins also makes an appearance, in what would be Peter Jackson's way to ease into The Hobbit, sowing the seeds for any viewer in future to link up everything together. With pictures already leaked on more recurring characters, one waits with bated breath how it all gets uniquely intertwined.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this was essentially The Fellowship of the Ring part 2, where instead of a mixed fellowship consisting of hobbits, a dwarf, an elf, a wizard and many humans, this one was predominantly dwarfs led by their de-facto leader Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who have gathered together, mentored by Gandalf, and introduced to the 14th member of their squad, the reluctant Bilbo Baggins. In a promise of adventure, the true quest here is to recover the legendary kingdom of Erebor at the Lonely Mountain, which the dragon Smaug had massacred dwarfish ancestors and had taken over all of their land and riches. Thinking that Smaug, being unseen for years, could be dead, or time they'd get their act together to take back what's dwarf legacy, this becomes the main objective and plot of the film, in addition to common themes covered such as friendship.<br/><br/>The similarities between the earlier movies and this one cannot be more pronounced. Take away the deliberate, creative aspects, this felt very much like Fellowship of the Ring 2, albeit with a new team and new objective altogether. Thre's this sense of deja vu, whether be it fight scenes in the underground mines of Moria, or being pursued by Orcs and their wolf-dogs, that you'd wonder how else the filmmakers could have deviated or innovated with something new, rather than cutting too close to what many would have already be fairly familiar with. Granted that themes are universal in nature, but this translation to the screen could have been a little bit more varied - do we need another archer in a dwarf to compensate for Legolas' absence, or filler scenes such as the many sweeping shots of landscapes?<br/><br/>I was initially a little apprehensive with Martin Freeman being Bilbo Baggins, but I'm glad to be proved wrong through his superb performance, in perfect balance to bring out those small town principle and values and applying them to the extraordinary situations he finds himself in, making him truly the accidental hero many times over, and drawing us in to this wildcard of a team member within the company of dwarfs. It doesn't matter if one is the smallest or most inexperienced, that it's what inherently inside that counts and inspires. As Gandalf had put it, his choice for the last member of the company is puzzling, but somehow Bilbo gives him courage, which gets proved time and again through the narrative, which I hope to see more of in the following films.<br/><br/>And of course, holding this film together like glue as we get acquainted with the ensemble, is Ian McKellen reprising his role. We get to see more of Gandalf the Grey at his element, shrewd and sly to aid his cause and motives amongst the company, serving as the strong link between two eventual trilogies. Richard Armitage provided his Thorin with natural leadership and charisma, whose development later in the story will almost definitely be heart-wrenching given where the film here had left off in his established friendship with Bilbo. As for the other dwarfs, well, too many and too few screen time for most meant that it's unfortunate they remain in the background, save for a handful played by Ken Stott, Aidan Turner and Dean O'Gorman. Perhaps the other personalities will shine in the forthcoming films.<br/><br/>Being the first film of the trilogy, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, was quite expected in the way things turned out, by playing it safe, adopting a narrative structure similar to The Fellowship of the Ring in its build up, having familiar characters return to the table to provide that level of comfort for audiences returning to Middle Earth, before and hopefully, finding its feet and tangent off on its own as we got left with the usual cliffhanger involving gazing into the horizon, promising a lot more. The Misty Mountains song, already lyric by Tolkien himself in the book, will prep you with goosebumps each time it's sung, by the dwarfs or during the end credits, or when it serves as the broad theme in the soundtrack, lending prominence to the objective charted out for the story."
"TxMike","Null","6","20","1 May 2013"," The Peter Jackson franchise marches on. In all a pretty entertaining movie.
","The RING movies and now the HOBBIT are indeed well-written and well-acted. But in truth, the location, New Zealand, is the star of all these movies. In the DVD for this movie is a 6-minute ""extra"" which is simply a feature on New Zealand and the various locations for the main scenes. Some of them, like Hobbit Town, are now also being turned into tourist attractions, to allow fans to visit the actual areas and, as the narration suggests, even be able to knock on the door of Bilbo Baggins' residence. <br/><br/>In the first of the RING trilogy we learn that Bilbo has had possession of the last remaining One Ring, and Frodo is charged with the task of returning it and having it destroyed. In this movie, which amounts to the first prequel, we see how 60 years earlier Bilbo comes into possession of the ring. <br/><br/>It starts with a bit of Middle Earth history, where one group had its homeland taken away, and now Gandalf is recruiting young Bilbo to be part of an expedition to regain their land for them. Along the way many perils await, and we see most of them, and the narrow escapes that ensue. Of course they had narrow escapes, otherwise there wouldn't be a movie, would there? One of them was Bilbo's encounter with Golum in a cave, and it was Golum dropping the ring that afforded Bilbo the chance to get it, and then to use it to escape to freedom.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen is of course appropriate as Gandalf , and Martin Freeman, young-looking for a man in his 40s, is good as the young Bilbo . <br/><br/>These have been great movies for Tolkien fans, all extremely well made, and also a gold mine for Peter Jackson and the team responsible for making them. This one ends in a manner that sets up the sequel, and in fact the next two HOBBIT movies are already in post-production."
"WildBullWriter","5","6","20","29 December 2012"," Quite disappointed in one major way
","Here is what really bothers me about this movie: As the movie opens, a birthday party is about to begin. Bilbo Baggins is turning 111 years old (and Frodo is turning 33)... then the story flashes back to when Bilbo set off on his adventure... at that time he was 50 years old (we are talking hobbit years, of course)... and his adventure begins.<br/><br/>Now moving along to ""The Lord of the Rings"" story... it opens with the same birthday party, with Bilbo turning 111 and Frodo turning 33, and Bilbo disappearing just after he gives Frodo the ring to keep... then the story flashes forward to when Frodo turns 50 and he sets off on his own adventure.<br/><br/>So it is that both Bilbo (in ""The Hobbit"") and Frodo (in ""The Rings"") set off on their respective adventures at the age of 50.<br/><br/>BUT... compare the actors used in these movies. Elijah Wood, who played Frodo, was about 20 years old when he made ""The Rings"" movies, whereas Martin Freeman, who plays Bilbo, is about 40 years old. Elijah Wood seems boyish, whereas Martin Freeman appears almost middle-aged. Yet both of them are playing 50-year-old hobbits.<br/><br/>The difference really jarred me. Still jars me. It doesn't fit. Very inconsistent.<br/><br/>It would've been far better to have used a younger actor for Bilbo in ""The Hobbit"".<br/><br/>After all, if one is going to tell a story using visual language rather than literary language, then the visual language needs to be as internally coherent, just literary language is coherent within the novels."

He not only reused music cues (""here's the Ring"" cue, ""here's Gandalf being wise and warm"" cue, ""here's the company/fellowship being chased by orcs/goblins underground"" cue), but he recycled many of the action beats (large and small) from ""Fellowship,"" as well.

","When I heard that Peter Jackson was directing a new hobbit film initially I freaked out with excitement. Then when I found out he had divided it into three parts, I began to have suspicions about the quality of the work. Were my suspicions vindicated? Sorta<br/><br/>First off let me talk about the film. Its the story of Frodo's Uncle, Bilbo Baggins, who sets out on an adventure with 13 dwarfs to reclaim their homeland with the wizard, Gandalf the Grey. My fist problem i had with it was the pacing. it felt slow at some points (not during the prologue) and i felt i was watching an overly extended movie. i cant say it was all bad because it did add a lot of details from the book, which often adaptations of novels would cut out for time. as everyone says, Martin Freeman's performance was dead on. Every time I will retread the book, I'll probably think of him as Bilbo. The surrounding cast was good in their roles although the dwarfs performance tend to be similar to each other Lessing the distinction of the cast. Sometimes although the story can be almost more aimed for younger audiences and lacks some of the darkness and maturity of the LOTR films. The 48 frames per second in 3D got some time to get use to. The visuals were so stunning that you could unfortunately at some points tell it was fake. Most of the CGi worked in the film minus maybe a few orcs or other creatures now and again. The sweeping landscapes of New Zealand provide great setting to the movie. Another problem is lack of diversity in the score. I don't always mind when the same pieces come up, but throughout the 2:45 hour movie, I heard only about 3 distinctly different pieces. <br/><br/>But don't let all my negativity fool you. I still pleasantly enjoyed the movie. It was still a good movie that was a great journey. The visuals were spectacular, the acting was mostly spot on. Overall despite its flaws, An unexpected Journey is still a good outing. Just don't expect an Oscar winning fantasy feature, from my experience. <br/><br/>Overall, 7.5/10"

","Before I went to the cinema I heard some negative reviews and opinions on this movie so I expected three hours of boredom but fortunately I was wrong. There are of course some things that deserve criticism when it comes to battles in which our heroes kill hundreds of enemies without a scratch but that is no different from LOTR and some slapstick humour, and it is a young adults story so it's OK. I know some viewers expected realistic battles without character shields, like in Game of Thrones"" but The Hobbit"" was written in some other time. First of all this is a feel-good movie. It was nice to see some characters from LOTR and as before the photography and scenery is beautiful. In this movie the focus is on the dwarfs, the race we have seen too little of in LOTR. And at first glance they did not seem interesting enough to explore them more deeply, but in this movie we have tragic story of dwarfs of Erebor who now live homeless in exile and dream to return to their home which has been taken over by a vicious dragon Smaug, a foe against whom there is no defense. This movie is about their quest to reclaim Erebor. There are some moments in the movie which seemed cringeworthy like dwarf songs but it is after all a part of their character and after you hear Under the Misty Mountain cold"" you will feel how tragic and sad their are. Another point which is to be criticized is some misplaced slapstick humour concerning Trolls. They are shown like the three Stooges and frankly I never thought of them so. They are slow-minded and stupid but very dangerous in battle as we have seen in LOTR. And the Goblin King is ridiculous. He is to eloquent for his lot and not threatening at all. And he also dies stupidly. We also have a new wizard – Radagast the Brown – who is shown wonderfully eccentric. The battles are dynamic and cool but suffer from old movie clichés like character shield"", almost lethal weapons"", hero killer"", conservation of ninjutsu"", suspension of disbelief"", made of iron"" etc. When the main character (in this case Thorin Oakenshield) believes that his main antagonist is dead we know he is wrong, and the hero is almost invulnerable except when he meets his main enemy (in this case Azog the Defiler). But this things aside, it is fun to watch goblins being killed by hundreds . The scene with Gollum was fun but I don't think we will be seeing him in a sequel. It was cool to see Saruman as good guy in the meeting in Rivendel with Galadriel and Elrond. We see some hints to his ignorance which will be his doom in LOTR. And of course, we have the Necromancer storyline, which will hopefully be explored deeper then in the book. All in all, it is a fun movie and you will be surprised by how quickly it ends."

","I would like to begin with special mention to Howard Shore for his excellent scores which really brings life into the franchise again - At times the heavenly tunes of Elfish and other times the verses of proud Dwarfs , not to mention from the eloquent beauty of the shire to the drumming of the goblin caves - Mr. Shore has covered it all . The theme of the Hobbit film is similar to Lord of the Rings which makes u feel in the same universe at the same the tonal differences differentiates u from its predecessors. That being said we see the reprising roles of Elrond , Galadriel , Frodo ,Saruman and Older Bilbo which to me was necessary to keep up the synergy of the franchise. Jackson has once again captured the middle earth in his cameras with the same magic that he did a decade ago. Brilliant cinematic sequences and more so this time for the actual nature of the hobbits and the dwarfs are beautifully crafted out. The kitchen scene to me is the best Tolkien - ish experience i ever had in the franchise . Its lot light , funny and a bookish delight to all the fans. The sets are absolutely brilliant I was absolutely astounded by Erebor and the Goblin stronghold at the Misty mountains. With many critics blabbing about the length of the film I think it is quite necessary otherwise developing characters will be very difficult. We see how the relationship between Thorin and Bilbo is portrayed out by the end of the film that plays a significant roles in the upcoming ones. Now Acting - Martin Freeman just is PERFECT .. Armitage portrayed Thorin better than the book and at times better than Aragorn , Ian Mckellen as Gandalf is our popular hero who is ever-green , the old and grumpy and witty one .. Dwarfs roles really amazed me and were brilliantly acted which makes me all the more interested. Now regarding the visual effects, the CGI was astounding , Gollum was life like, Azog was tremendous and i liked the ways they designed the wargs. 48 fps wasn't a problem for me . No strain to eyes and a lot more brighter.. I think its brilliant to try something new..besides i saw it in all the formats.. SO IF U WANT THE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR REGULAR otherwise take the unexpected ride of 48Fps. . I m really excited for the future films..."

","I am a huge fan of the lord of the rings as well as the hobbit, In my opinion I thought the hobbits first installment was a visual masterpiece. I agree that watching at 48 fps in 3d is very overwhelming But other than that it was pretty close to just using the book as the screen play, minimal changes, actors were stunning, and every one has there own opinion but those who say Jrr Tolkien copied harry potter are as misinformed as those who voted for Obama, Jrr Tolkien wrote the hobbit then lotr before jk row ling was even born or thought of! I give peter Jackson 2 thumbs up, and the idea to split it into three parts is great because no one could do the hobbit justice in 2 hours and 50 mins, I am eagerly awaiting the next two installments."
"flex-o-matic","7","5","16","20 December 2012"," 3D HFR version - tries very hard to imitate but fails on several levels
","I LOVE LOVE LOVE Peter Jackson and the LOTR series. Maybe that's why I was pretty much disappointed when I walked out of The Hobbit yesterday night, seeing it in 3D HFR on a huge screen.<br/><br/>Let me explain why. First, right from the start you will see that the movie has the exact same sequence like LOTR. There is about 30 minutes of pre-story (maybe good for another prequel), introduction of the characters and then the preparation for the journey starts and they are off.<br/><br/>However, where the LOTR movies give you a sense of greatness, scale, the yin and yang of middle earth and different angles on the different characters, this movie tries to narrow down and concentrate too much on a handful of characters which never ever leave the scene.<br/><br/>Second, although the cartoony hyper-realistic visuals are absolutely breathtaking (I make 3D animations for a living) there is a BIG HUGE problem ...... a ridiculously shallow depth-of-field. Every time a character or scene is in frame, the foreground and background are extremely blurry. This creates a very flat image without any sense of depth, surely cool with 3D glasses because the actual subject is floating in space but way too much in-your-face because that's the only thing you will see. It kept distracting me because 90% of our vision is peripheral and it really brings the movie down. I need to see the non-3D version and I hope they get rid of this in the blu-ray release.<br/><br/>Third, Peter should not have 'solved' the little mysteries that are present in the LOTR like where does the the elvish blade come from that Bilbo gave to Frodo or repeat scenes like Gandalf talking to an insect to call the Eagles. Also there is no single mention of the origin of Gollum, or the ring, or who was sauron, it's just there. If you would see this movie without ever having seen the LOTR you would have no idea what half of the stuff is about and be completely lost.<br/><br/>Last, although a fun movie to watch, it's nowhere near as good as any of the 3 LOTR movies. It tries too hard to imitate, fails to keep the audience interested (people started talking and wandering around in the theater) and the ending was way too abrupt. Nobody clapped afterwards or hung out to see if there is maybe a spoiler at the end, everybody just left."
"sohansurag","8","5","16","17 December 2012"," A Little Less on Grandeur but a must-watch nonetheless!
","The Lord of Rings Trilogy by J R R Tolkien could be considered one of mankind's magnificent literary works. Tolkien wrote a true epic complete with supporting languages, maps and what not. Considering its magnitude it was considered unfilmable, yet Peter Jackson did it. Of course he took liberties in adapting the magnanimous books to celluloid yet the same epicness was captured in his movie trilogy. Peter Jackson did indeed set a milestone in filming history, with his LOTR trilogy having legendary battles, never before seen CG wizardry and backed by Tolkien's own works it was to nobody's amazement that Return of King had won 13 Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson decided to pool in more stories from the Middle Earth to The Hobbit and make it a trilogy. The previews were decent enough but nothing bragged to go watch the movie. I decided to watch this one in IMAX as it boasted of superior visuals and sound. And believe me when I say ""I was never disappointed!""<br/><br/>The Hobbit promises & delivers almost everything the previous LOTR movies had done. Heroism, Courage, Adventure, Fantasy everything you could ever imagine on Middle Earth. The Story of Bilbo Baggins couldn't have been told any better. You get to see familiar characters, you revisit familiar placesit was just nostalgic. I was comfortably seated on the very uncomfortable PVR IMAX due to one good reason: I was very much immersed in the movie. And despite its 160 minutes run time, it seldom gets boring.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins was clumsy and quirky than the adolescent Hobbitses of LOTR Trilogy. I have to say he was better than Frodo or Sam. I felt all the characters, good or bad, had equal screen time and they all stood out. It really matters because you've got like 13 dwarfs scampering on screen at any given time, each with their own individual personality. It was indeed a feat to give em all equal importance and Peter Jackson has done it skillfully. Of which, Thorin played fantastically by Richard Armitage stands out, even with all those layers of prosthetic. Ian McKellan once again reprises his role as Gandalf the Grey and its always good to see him. Andy Serkis returns as the ever-malevolent Gollum, revamped and re-CG'd in all its grandeur. I had a wave of goosebumps through me when I was first given a glimpse of Gollum. The sequence where Bilbo & Gollum plays a game of riddle is one of the high points of 'The Hobbit'. It once again it reminded me why Gollum was my favorite computer generated characters of all time. The Pale Orc, Azog, felt just bland. It was one thing to see Gollum brought back to life in CG in all its glory and to compare it with Azog unthinkable. It only makes me wonder with all this budget why didn't Peter & WETA put their efforts in creating Azog as lifelike as Gollum. Azog never felt like an intimidating antagonist either.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has masterfully recreated the living breathing world of Middle Earth, yet again. You get sucked into this world of fantasy in no time. Epic battles are never a stranger to the LOTR movies and its no different in The Hobbit albeit a little less epic I'd say. It was a true delight to watch it all in 3D.<br/><br/>Fun is stamped all over the movie. Even when our heroes are rushing past Trolls, Orcs and Goblins, even when everything was at stake, comedy was delivered throughout their adventure. There comes a tiny thing that put me off. The movie is really jovial at times and in the next, they show something really gory. I was kinda disoriented why they'd done it. It is an adaptation of a kids book and there wasn't any need of this kinda gore. At least not to please the adult audiences. I am a fan of gore, but I thought the addition of gore in this one was really unnecessary.<br/><br/>Sound Design was superb and I'd be glad if it gets an Academy Award. The clangs & swishes of swords, hammers, the Troll yells of Agony everything was superb. Howard Shore's score was warm, welcoming and mellow at times, heroic and adventurous the other. 'Misty Mountains' is a very noteworthy track that you'd be most likely humming on your way home from the movies.<br/><br/>CG felt great, but there were sequences that felt unfinished. IMAX didn't help at that either because the details were almost in your face and I was like'oh thats a blue screen scene', 'this is totally CG'. A bit more finesse could have helped.<br/><br/>The Hobbit The Unexpected Journey, does recapture the very good feeling of watching a Tolkien movie but being the first movie in a planned trilogy it was unable to get that 'Fellowship' vibe. Partly because the subject matter of the Hobbit's tale was never as vast as the LOTR trilogy. They are just squeezing in bits of other lore from Tolkiens works to make a trilogy and it definitely has that feeling. I expected to see 'Smaug' but I was disappointed, I anticipated a cliffhanger ending like that of 'Two Towers' and I was disappointed again. In short Peter Jackson is letting us know that everything can't be as epic as LOTR. The Hobbit, like Fellowship, felt incomplete to be justifying the the impending sequel. But being a fan-boy the ride was awesome nonetheless. With, The Unexpected Journey, lets just hope that The Hobbit is setting, rather grandly, of things to come."

","I'd consider it highly interesting that after all the reviews I just read the only image in my mind is that of a witness. A witness of rape to be precise. Unable to comprehend, embellishing the hellish experience and when asked about it completely in denial. Once upon a time... actually yesterday I went to see the Hobbit. I had to calm myself and trim any expectations I had whatsoever. In fact, I always do that before visiting the cinema, usually spares my the disappointment. Now what can I say about the Hobbit. Imaginge... a bar, that you're holding onto. Beneath you bubblingly hot lava. No need to worry, the bar is very high still. After the first hour however you feel the bar lowering itself through the magic of forced humor and ugly one liners. To bad the bar wont rise again, instead it keeps on getting lower and lower and you feel feel the sole of your shoe melting away and the heat is starting to make your own blood seethe and then, it's over. So the Hobbit doesn't go down completely. It's more the way I just described it. It is effect cinema. Mesmericingly beautiful visual effects and action scenes choreographed into perfection. But I could only wonder why, oh why didn't the creators just inserted a loud burp-sound whenever a character would speak. But screw my judgment. Make up your own mind about The Hobbit - An unexpected Journey."

","I definitely rate this as excellent. Today was the opening day in the U.S.<br/><br/>Seeing it in 3D really adds to the excitement and makes you feel like you're in the mix of it all. That doesn't happen in all movies just because they are in 3D. It also have humor added in.<br/><br/>And don't worry if you haven't seen all the previous Hobbit or Lord of the Rings movies because you can still follow along without a problem. I was worried about that because I myself have never seen them. When we were leaving the theater there was a line of people waiting to get in and a couple kids were asking how it was. I gave a thumbs up because I didn't want to give ANYTHING away. Definitely go out and see it."
"esotericforest","8","5","16","14 December 2012"," An overall great movie, with an unexpected disappointment
","The complaints about it being too long are ridiculous, and I now see how they can split it into three movies. From what I can remember, I do feel like they stuck pretty close to the story in the book, which I always appreciate. They actually strayed further from it in Lord of the Rings. The story was good and almost everything about it I liked. My main beef with the entire movie is that I feel that visually the creatures were better done and grittier looking in The Lord of the Rings. The orcs have a different body shape that doesn't make you think ""Oh hey they could have been elves once"" like they used to...and frankly they just aren't as creepy or ""scary"" looking as they were. A lot of it has to do with them being completely digital...and to my eye, I can easily tell they are which is a huge knock for me. Gollum was done excellent though, so you just know they spent more time making him perfect. My disappointment is that after 10 plus years...visually the movie should have been better in every way, and as far as creature generation it just isn't beating the use of prosthetic in the old movies.<br/><br/>On a more positive note....Thorin is awesome. I have never been a big fan of dwarfs in any fantasy series, but they really made me like Thorin. Bilbo was also done very well, and Gandalf not surprisingly was excellent. I really loved everything added including showing the Dwarven kingdom at its peak, and the attack by Smaug. I also loved every second in Rivendell and the council was probably one of my favorite overall scenes. Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman, and Gandalf all did an excellent job acting and really building the tension in the story that up to that point was slightly lacking.<br/><br/>And finally, the epic build to seeing Smaug in full was excellent. Smaug is the dragon of all dragons, and the dragon that all dragons since have been based off of to some extent."

I found a hard time to concentrate and acknowledging what is going on in the movie or what the hell are they talking about, neither did my friends. The graphic is stunning but couldn't save the movie. I honestly don't understand why the heck is this movie rating so high.

","At first I was put off by a number of negative reviews.I hesitated to watch the movie because of this and my expectations were rather low.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong! As someone who watched the original trilogy many, many times over - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is *every little* bit as good as the original LOTR movies.<br/><br/>This movie was epic from the beginning to the end, without any of the alleged negative things others complained about. I remember that some people complained about too many action scenes or parts being too ""cartoony"" and comedy-like, but I entirely disagree.<br/><br/>Nothing in this movie was ""too much"" or overdone, the pace and action was perfect in my opinion, without turning the movie into a ""cheap"" action flick as some people said.<br/><br/>Jackson, without a doubt, did it again and created another masterpiece and I cannot wait for the next part.

"JBLOSS","7","4","12","2 January 2013"," Unexpectedly underwhelming
","I must admit that I had high hopes when I went to see The Hobbit, but with a question of how a relatively short book could be turned into 7 or so hours of film over the 3 instalments. I had fond memories of reading the book and I loved the LOTR films. Unfortunately I think the film really suffers from unnecessary padding and action scenes that just add nothing to the story. The film is a little too knowing with references to the later events of LOTR so it loses some of its innocence. The saddest thing is that the film does look great but it just seems to drag - it's overlong and really doesn't benefit from adding in additional Orc encounters or additional characters. The book in my memory is a little bit more lighthearted and innocent compared to LOTR but this gets battered by too much blood and gore. Martin Freeman does a decent job as Bilbo but he doesn't seem to have a massive range of acting skills - he's the same in The Office or Sherlock Holmes and most of the dwarfs are fairly anonymous. I couldn't call it a disaster but it does not meet the high standards of LOTR and I think the decision to go with 3 films is a massive mistake - out of them might come one decent edited version but on present evidence each instalment is going to be bloated and unsatisfying."
"thunder1road","10","4","12","1 January 2013"," The Hobbit is pure magic.
","We just saw The Hobbit - based on one of my all-time favorite books. I have seen reviews of The Hobbit that criticized the 48fr version and generally felt that the show was a bit slow and dull due to the fact that they are making 3 movies out of one book. With Lord of the Rings they made 3 movies out of 3 large books. I enjoyed the LOTR movies but always felt that they were all about the battles but not so much about the wonderful poetry and mysticism in the books. However, in my humble opinion - by telling the story of one book in 3 movies, Peter Jackson has given himself the screen time to bring in the flavor of the poetry and mysticism of the book in a way that never happened in the LOTR movies. And I was very surprised to find that I loved The Hobbit from the first frame to the last. It is the most successful translation of book to movie I've ever seen. We saw Lincoln a few days ago and as much as I love that movie - I love The Hobbit even more. I've got to back to hear Thorin sing ""The Lonely Mountain Song"" one more time. And it will be the IMAX version."
"Jonathon_Natsis","8","4","12","31 December 2012"," Expectedly Excellent.
","If there is such a thing as a 'runt of the litter' when discussing arguably the greatest trilogy of all time, then it can equally be said that The Hobbit is certainly no weaker than the weakest Lord of the Rings film. For a film tailored towards a somewhat younger audience without necessarily appearing 'child-oriented', there is plenty on offer to create that elusive feeling of total immersion so loudly demanded by fans of all ages.<br/><br/>The Hobbit follows a baker's dozen of brave dwarfs; led by their fearless king Thorin (Richard Armitage), as they make plans to reclaim their stolen mountain home from the dragon Smaug. They enlist the help of the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen, deftly slipping back into his magic robes), who in turn selects the reluctant homemaking Hobbit Bilbo (Martin Freeman) to aid them on their perilous journey.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast compliment one another beautifully, in spite of the fact that screen time is skewed in favour of only five or six major cast members. This is understandable, given the vast array of different personas at hand, and is mitigated by a fun introductory sequence involving all the dwarfs crashing Bilbo's dinner. <br/><br/>Speaking of whom, the titular Hobbit makes for a very endearing character, as the superbly cast Freeman makes the role his own with all the neuroticism of a hairy-footed Woody Allen, and the quick wit to match. It should come as no surprise then, that the famous game of riddles between Bilbo and Serkis' always-enjoyable Gollum serves as the film's highlight.<br/><br/>Concerns over the film's runtime are a non-issue. Although The Hobbit checks in just short of three hours, it rarely labours, and is instead efficiently paced enough to keep cinema-goers from time checks. Its lighter, family-friendlier tone does lend itself a couple of troughs- including set pieces involving a trio of trolls and Barry Humphries' Goblin King (both of which overstay their welcome just a little bit)- that feel unnecessary in part because the story's abundance of villains as it is. <br/><br/>A heavier burden carried by CGI, as opposed to actors in prosthetics, takes away the intimidation factor of at least one antagonist, but the aesthetics and sheer storytelling class remain, strongly suggesting that the best may be yet to come for Peter Jackson's welcome return to Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"

","Forget what the critics say abut this film. The Hobbit is the same grand, epic spectacle we have come to expect from Peter Jackson and co. The action set-pieces are fantastic, but there is more humour in the Hobbit that makes this a much warmer tale than the later Lord of the Rings movies. The dwarfs provide much of this comedy, but even Gandalf gets in on the act. Features a memorable cameo by Barry Humphries as the goblin king, and excellent songs by Neil Finn. Everything about the Hobbit is a pleasure to watch. My personal favourite is Radagast the Brown and his unusual method of transportation! Go see it for yourself. This is a superb adventure film that is not to be missed."

In his new venture, Jackson has decided to rectify his one pointed out error of his crown jewel. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is taken almost word by word,out of the books. This applies even to the dialogues. That sort of justifies the necessity of making three movies out of this book. As far as the acting department was concerned,it was as good as the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy,and I cant give a higher compliment.

"hugomelo600","8","4","12","27 December 2012"," A very enjoyable journey back to Middle Earth, even if somewhat smaller in scope.
","Peter Jackson's new journey into Middle Earth is an extremely entertaining and well constructed movie. It is not, of course, up to the impossible high standard that The Lord Of The Rings set for Jackson, but it is, on all accounts, a very good fantasy and adventure movie. The movie got critizised for it's deliberate leisured pace. Although I agree that some of the movie's scenes are not essencial and could very well be truncated without disrupting the narrative, the fact remains that these scenes, although not essencial to the plot, are not boring or uninteresting. The movie has considerable length but it never gets tiresome. Of course the novelty is somewhat gone to the point where at certain moments you can predict what course of action certain characters will take to advert tragedy .But despite that, the movie never gets boring and will certainly keep most viewers riveted throughout the movie due to it's well placed humor, beautiful imagery, visual effects, fleshed-out world and cameos of Middle Earth inhabitants that have been introduced to us in ""The Lord Of The Rings"". The movie, if approached on it's own terms and not subjected to comparison to it's counterpart, stands scrutiny with great ease. Or it should, but apparently the critics failed to evaluate it fairly, considering the average tomatometer rating. How this movie gets an average of 65 per cent and the childish, cartoonish, terribly scripted Sklyfall is over 90 per cent is beyond my grasp."

"brighambartol","8","4","12","26 December 2012"," Great for fans, alright for everyone else
","Anyone expecting another Lord of The Rings will probably be disappointed in this movie - but of course, the original books were quite different in tone and in scope, and their film adaptations reflect that. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has all the brilliant sets, music, and costumes that LOTR did, and with another stunning cast of characters. Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage (and all the cast, really) execute their parts perfectly. The movie is light, fun, action-filled and highly entertaining. It has less of the dark, epic drama than the LOTR trilogy, more in tune with the book upon which it is based.<br/><br/>In an attempt to stretch The Hobbit into three movies, its creators have padded the story with additional tales and details from Tolkien's legendarium. This will please fans of Tolkien's work, and provide some informative context for the more casual moviegoers. However, this padding does affect the pacing of the movie, to the point where it can seem a little slow and dry. Some patchwork done by the scriptwriters seems a little out of tune with the language borrowed straight from the books, so that every once in a while one character or another will drop in a modern phrase that doesn't quite seem to fit. But this isn't a fatal flaw, and the more exciting parts of the film more than make up for its slower start.<br/><br/>This is one of the better 3D movies I've seen, and the higher frame rate is probably part of the reason. Director Peter Jackson has said that 48 frames per second will take some getting used to for most people, but it is the way of the future. I think he's right: you will find it strange to watch this movie (if you see it in a theatre that can actually show you the higher frame rate), but by the end of it I had adjusted. I had the same experience with this as I had when HD shows started becoming popular: it seems very un-real at first, because it isn't what you're used to, but after a while of watching it you realize it is realistic, so much so that it's more realistic than any movie you've ever watched before. In The Hobbit, this makes for some some stunning effects, and captures the beautiful Middle Earth landscapes better than anything before it.<br/><br/>So, is it another Lord of The Rings? Not really, but it shouldn't be. I suspect some of the additional elements pulled in from Tolkien's larger volume of work will play out in greater detail in the rest of the trilogy, and hopefully this helps fill out the plot to correct some of the poor pacing int he first installment. An Unexpected Journey is definitely worth the watch. It's entertaining, visually thrilling, and will no doubt lead into a great trilogy of films."
"luke-eberhardt","9","4","12","26 December 2012"," In a Hole in the Ground There lived a Hobbit
","It was all those many years ago when Peter Jackson's Epic ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy hit big in the early Noughties. Although originally conceived to be unfilmable, by that time the world was immersed in Tolkien's Middle Earth Made possible on screen by Jackson and his incredible team. By the end of it it was a triumph and remembered as pure classic. I saw all three films on the big screen back then in all three years they were released. After then I remember an old friend saying to me a year later ; ""You know whats bad about this year?"" ""No Lord of the Rings movie"".<br/><br/>Then there was talk about 'The Hobbit' getting the big screen adaptation. The process was long but it managed to get itself back on its feet. I would partly agree that one film based on one book would have been enough, but Jackson and his team had the idea to expand the universe of Middle Earth for 'The Hobbit', so Two films were commissioned. But now we have another Middle Earth Trilogy to look forward to in the shape of Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit'.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey is the first part of this story. It begins with Sir Ian Holm as the older Bilbo Baggins as what appears to be telling young Frodo (Elijah Wood) his story and what he knows.<br/><br/>We get an flashback to how the Dwarfs became mighty in their kingdom under the mountain known as Erebor. King Thrain rules humbly but has an obsession of treasure, The Dwarfs were then thrown from Erebor after being attacked by the retched dragon Smaug, The Elves depart the Dwarfs help, so they're left to scatter throughout the land.<br/><br/>The opening drama in Bag End basically takes place before the events of 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Then starts the real story with the younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) 60 years earlier, He's a Hobbit who lives a comfortable life in the Shire until Gandalf the Grey (Sir Ian McKellen, who never seems to age) invites Bilbo on an adventure. Bilbo declines until the 13 Dwarfs arrive for dinner, Gandalf reveals he wants Bilbo to be a Burglar to steal into The Lonely Mountain's treasure chamber. Bilbo is still unsure until he finally packs up and goes on this adventure in the company of the Dwarfs to The Lonely Mountain.<br/><br/>I won't need to summarize the plot if you've read the book. I'm almost grateful that Jackson is expanding the story and universe for his film(s) to make it unique from what other Tolkien adaptation were like.<br/><br/>Much of the same production team that was used of LOTR return for the Hobbit. The Grand Scale look and production design and special effects are top notch and could be bettered. New Zealand's landscape once again makes it possible for Middle Earth to become live again. We can once again lose ourselves in this incredible and vast world.<br/><br/>The tone of the film clearly matches the feel of the book. The Hobbit is a more light hearted and more a fairy tale compared to the dark, scary and mature themes presented in 'Lord of the Rings'. I could also say the the film does have a lot of humour for it light hearted tones.<br/><br/>The many other plot points and characters in the expanding of the story play a great part in the film. It would have also been hard for previous film makers adapting the Hobbit to give clear definitions for each of the Dwarfs. Jackson has done that perfectly making sure that we care a lot for the company on their journey. Thorin is the Dwarf with the most depth being a Dwarven prince who wants his birth right as heir to Erebor and meeting his old enemy, Azog; who was thought to be dead. Radagast the Brown is also a new subploted character who discovers a dark power in Dol Guldur. Other reprising roles include Gollum (in his iconic scene), The Elves Elrond and Galadriel, and lastly the wizard Saruman the White, play their small parts in the story.<br/><br/>The Casting is flawless, Jackson made sure every actor played their role to fit into the story and universe. Martin Freeman is fantastic as Bilbo; brings the right amount of humour and unlikely hero sense. Richard Armatage is a Revelation as Thorin as I saw this character play I could almost see what his future death would be like. Former Doctor Who; Sylvester McCoy is also fantastic as Radagast the Brown being the nature caring wizard with a big heart and powerful magic. Barry Humphies plays The Goblin King, big bulky very ruthless. Benedict Cumberbatch (Freeman's Sherlock co-star) plays two roles in the film(s); one as the voice and motion capture of Smaug the dragon (we didn't see much) and the necromancer an evil creature awakening from the dead.<br/><br/>I couldn't agree more that the 3D effects and HFR really give viewers an immersive experience almost as if they're in the film. Its a proved effect that really works within the spectacle and scale of the film's competency. Viewers may see the film in the usual 24fps format, but I tell you now. Your mind won't be blown seeing it in HFR and 3D that's the real way to go with this.<br/><br/>Overall The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic film, well welcome return to Middle Earth, thrilling, charming, with dazzling effect, and even more excitement to look froward to in further installments. It may be too much or too slow for some viewers but, clearly in my eyes the film is excellent with so much effort thanks to one great director, and such an entertaining adventure flick.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

I also saw it at 24 fps, and it looked beautiful so no complaints there.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this movie is very light and fanciful, especially in the beginning. Some parts are very similar to Fellowship, with some familiar locations fans will enjoy. The beginning when the dwarfs all arrive at Bag End had me laughing quite a bit. However, it is quite a while before Bilbo actually leaves the Shire on his adventure, and this attributes to he movies length of 170 mins.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are both great as Bilbo and Gandalf. Ian seems like he never left Gandalf and slipped right back into his wizard boots. The dwarfs are all given their own personalities, although some more than others, and they all help Bilbo out a lot. They give some great comedy relief too. <br/><br/>Visually the movie looks great. The Shire is as beautiful as ever, as is Rivendell. Everyone's heard that Gollum is in here, and he has one extended scene that is probably my favorite in the whole movie. There is also a fantastic escape sequence near the end. <br/><br/>My only real complaints are the movie's length and a couple of sevens that seemed unnecessary. At 170 mins. you will need to set aside an entire afternoon to go see it. But I still had a lot of fun with it. It might be a little to violent for young kids, but any other age should enjoy it."
"dtolfree","8","4","12","22 December 2012"," Spectacular 3D production of a classical story
","I saw the film in 3D IMAX format. The 48 per second rather than the normal 24 frames certainly improved the viewing on the IMAX screen. Judging by the interest in the UK it should have a similar box office success as in the US. The adaption of Tolkien's novel to bring it to a wide audience was in my view well-done. It easy to criticise content and portrayal if you are a Tolkien purist but since most of the viewers will not have or probably never will read the books, the film at least brought the story to life. Fantasy films have value into today's troubled world where greed and war still dominate.<br/><br/>Jackson has followed the theme of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, even to the extend of having a mountain and a band of travellers seeking it as main objectives of the story. My only criticisms which didn't spoil my enjoyment, was too much repetitative CGI in the fight scenes and the terrible regional accents of the dwarfs. Scottish didn't gel with the dialogue. Even with fantasy stories it's important to have some reality. There is no way 13 dwarfs would have survived unharmed the horrendous fights and falls over rocks and cliffs. I liked the parts of Bilbo Barggins and Gandalf played excellently by Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen. The fact that I am now eager to see what happens in the second film of the trilogy I guess works for the producer. The test also of a good production is the acting, the sets and not too much reliance on CGI. I give full marks on two of these but wonder how the film would rate if there was no or less GCI. Hence I score it at 8."
"nickmesafilms","8","4","12","21 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) - Welcome Back to Middle Earth! (+48fps Discussion)
","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is the first installment in the highly-anticipated ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, setting as a prequel to the original Lord of the Rings films, based on J.R.R. Tolkien's series of novels. Directer Peter Jackson has once again taken us back to this magical world that he has helped to create back then, and delivered yet again, another entertaining ride. ""An Unexpected Journey"" starts off the trilogy of prequels, where Bilbo Baggins, played by Martin Freeman, a little Hobbit in the land of the Shire, has been asked upon by Gandalf the Grey, bringing back Ian McKellen to the most memorable performance of his whole career, and a group of thirteen dwarfs, to set out on a very long journey to win back the dwarfs' treasure from a fiery dragon. In this first part, Peter Jackson has decided to film this movie in 48 frames per second, higher than the usual quality of an ordinary movie with 24fps. Although I didn't see ""The Hobbit"" in the 48fps format, I've heard plenty of mixed thoughts, that it made the film look distracting at times, making the fast action scenes look a little rough, while at times, it looks like the audience is actually stepping into Middle Earth. But, I just saw it in the regular format, but if I did see it in 48fps, I would have said the same thing. Starting off with the positive aspects, almost everything I adored from the original LOTR film trilogy, from the gorgeous effects, the beautiful music, the breathtaking detail in art direction and costumes, and the incredible directing style of Peter Jackson. As for the performances, Martin Freeman is definitely the one who steals the show playing Bilbo Baggins, delivering some perfectly-timed humor, some great moments of depth and heart, while having such great likability. Of course, Ian McKellen does a perfect job, reprising his role as Gandalf the Grey, and it's really fun to see this character back on screen. A few characters from the original trilogy reprise their roles in here, most of them should be unspoiled, but it felt very nice to see them back on screen. But sadly, this film does have a bunch of problems, not making them stand out like the original trilogy, while most of these problems are story-based. Peter Jackson tries way too hard to add many information from J.R.R. Tolkien's 300-page book and put into one trilogy. But for this first part, although staying true to the material so far, sadly adds a few unnecessary plot points, drawn-out exposition, and a few uninteresting characters to fill up the entire 166-minute movie. Although the leader of the dwarfs, Thorin, is the most interesting character with a great amount of back-story, depth, and bad-assedry to his character, most of the other dwarfs carry less of a personality, and it's hard to feel sympathy for most of these people, when they don't have a lot of character development to share. The first and third acts feel more like the entertaining aspects, while most of the second act drags on for the most part, making the pacing the lowest aspect of the movie. But, the film definitely makes up for that flaw with what is arguably the most entertaining scene in the whole movie: the confrontation between Bilbo and Gollum in the caves, sharing a game of riddles. I could have watched this terrific scene for 3 hours, and still be entertained. Through some of the best motion capture work ever put to film, Andy Serkis once again delivers a terrific performance, reprising his most memorable character in the LOTR trilogy, and it was such a fun time to see the character one last time. But for it's batch of flaws, ""The Hobbit"" is still an entertaining ride, with great action, performances, and visual splendor, even for it's few story-based issues. Whether in 24fps or 48fps, ""The Hobbit"" is an experience that still needs to be seen in the theaters, and as I much as I still believe that ""The Hobbit"" would have been better off as one full-length movie, instead of a trilogy, I'm still anticipating for Part 2. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", in my review, ""marvelous visuals and remarkable entertainment, but flawed""."
"tallmat","9","4","12","18 December 2012"," A new paradigm of realism in fantasy worlds
","The 5k, 48 frame per second, 3D footage w/ Dolby Atmos is truly incredible.<br/><br/>This is a film, finally, that is worth seeing in the theatre. Just Like the first Star Wars in 1977, or the Lord of the Rings. This is a seamless view of a fantasy world. <br/><br/>While some have complained that 48 fps is somewhat jarring, it completely revolutionizes 3D. 3D had lacked some clarity and sharpness before, but the 48 fps completely fixes all fast action scenes, and enhances all 3D effects. Some scenes, if scaled properly, could hypothetically appear as if the movie were a stage play in the theatre. This is a true revolution and it is worth seeing the film in 48 fps. Clearly, this is where film is headed, and it is beautiful. Some computer generated effects are more noticeable, but all are an overall improvement from the Lord of the Rings series. On the other hand, clothing, make-up, and overall set design, is absolutely outstanding and manages to keep pace with the new resolution. <br/><br/>A famous Riddles in the Dark scene, and a guest appearance from a lead character from Lord of the Rings shows excellent enhancements, and again is brilliantly acted.The actors are all excellent, and some of the most enjoyable scenes involve the dwarfs. <br/><br/>The score is outstanding, again by Howard Shore, and the songs from the dwarfs were memorable, nuanced and sombre. There is a scene in the beginning where the atmospheric sound of the room is entirely dull and absent, and this was quite striking, almost suffocating in a way- just like a hobbit who lives in a hole-bravo! <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the narrative adaptation was extremely disciplined, conservative, and appropriate in almost all situations. Sadly however, the narrative middle, or the part where the suspense takes a break before a temporary conclusion, is too long. Jackson appears to want to show off his more popular actors in one scene that is somewhat distracting from the overall film. I heard that since there were few women in the movie, they lingered on a scene involving Cate Blanchet; sadly, this is noticeable. Some things are better left to mystery, and Jackson would also do well NOT to answer every curiosity to his audience. Continued restraint will be necessary for maximum effect in this film. If Jackson avoids tying every plot line he can to the previous Lord of the Rings, his work will be stronger overall as it will appeal to the narrative mystery held by the audience. <br/><br/>This was an extremely complex film to design and deliver, and it is truly an amazing accomplishment of our species to put this tome to film. One thing is certain; if you love cinema, and fantasy, you will not be let down. The people who made this film love their work, and it is clear in every aspect of this mostly very tight film. <br/><br/>This viewer can only imagine that the reports of 'sickness'. vertigo, or comments that the movie is unnecessarily long, are overblown, and perhaps are part of an organized attempt to undermine something outside the Hollywood production circuit. Irrespective of these overly critical perspectives, this film will still deliver one of the most worthwhile and technically rewarding experiences in the history of cinema."
"GoodfellaSeinfeld","5","4","12","18 December 2012"," A journey through Middle Earth
","Before I begin this review I would like to say I am a HUGE fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King are, in my eyes, one complete movie and that one movie is my fourth favorite movie of all time. I seriously cannot sum up how I feel about these movies I love them so much. That being said, I was super hyped for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. This movie had very big shoes to fill and it probably was my most hyped movie of the years with maybe an exception for The Dark Knight Rises. I was so excited for this my which explains my reactions when I read the reviews basically destroying The Hobbit. With a 65% on Rotten Tomatoes currently, this was quite a punch to the gut for fans of the movies and the books. A 65% is about average for a movie, but with the original trilogy receiving an average of 94%, this was very shocking. After I saw the disappointingly low score, my hype for the movie plummeted. I was so disappointed I decided against seeing the movie at the midnight release or opening day. I finally decided to see the movie on Sunday night at a 3D showing and went into it with no expectations. I was amazed by what I saw. <br/><br/>The story is very interesting. A young and reluctant Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins is drafted by Gandalf, his wizard friend, to join a ragtag team of Dwarfs to take back the Dwarfs' home mountain, Erebor. Bilbo sets out on a ""unexpected journey"" to the Lonely Mountain with the spirited group of Dwarfs to reclaim a their stolen mountain home from a dragon named Smaug. I cannot really get into the story until the whole trilogy is finished but I would like to say that it does a great job of getting the trilogy started. <br/><br/>Unexpected Journey had many things in it that I really enjoyed. Martin Freeman did an amazing job as Bilbo Baggins. Freeman has become one of my favorite actors for his role in the BBC TV show Sherlock and it was very nice to see him play such a fantastic character as Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen also does a wonderful job as the wizard Gandalf. One of the main things that worried me about The Hobbit was having to switch back to Gandalf the Gray after we got Gandalf the White in The Two Towers and Return of the King. Fortunately, McKellen reprises his role so well, that you really do not remember Gandalf the Gray ever leaving. My new favorite character has to be Thorin, the Dwarf leader. Thorin is just so awesome that it actually made me wish that was in the original books so he could be included in the movies. I also really enjoyed the music, I know that this may sound like a lame thing to be excited about but The Lord of the Rings has some fantastic music and I would almost argue The Hobbit has even better music with the ""misty mountains cold"" theme. The Hobbit also has a lot of great scenes. I do not want to give away every good scene in the movie but let me just say that my two favorites are the scene with the Trolls, and the Orc fight. The Hobbit had solid acting all around, great CGI, and was actually very well written. <br/><br/>That being said, I had a few problems with this movie. My main problem being that the movie was obviously supposed to be only two parts. There are many scenes that you could tell were only added to pad the movie and make it a trilogy. There is a scene close to the beginning with Frodo and Bilbo and it could have been removed from the film all together. Another problem with the film is Bilbo kind of takes a backseat to the Dwarfs. I know that this is mostly a problem with the book, but if they could have added ANYTHING they should have added more scenes with Bilbo. The biggest problem I have with the Hobbit is the group of Dwarfs. The whole team is made up of about thirteen Dwarfs and none of them are really that memorable. I can see most people messing up which Dwarf is which and even worse some don't have speaking lines which makes the ones that do even easier to mix up. Those are the few nitpicky problems I have with the movie. Now I thought I should share some quick thoughts on the added scenes. Radagast the Brown was the new character that I could actually tolerate and the scene in Rivendell was OK even if it did stretch on too long. <br/><br/>I feel I should give two closing thoughts on The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. For a newcomer to the trilogy I think you will be a little harsher on the movie, giving it about a 7. I would say that the critics are wrong on this movie and I hope everyone goes to see it. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was, in my opinion, a great movie that though was disappointing, was still very good."
"sacostag17","10","4","12","17 December 2012"," Great And Fun
","I think most of the critics don't realize that this book the hobbit is a different kind of novel/book, it was made for kids and the lord of the rings is more serious and darker, the movie shows us what it really meant to be, fun, adventures, and even humor, there are 13 dwarfs... i think the crucial point is that the critics don't read Tolkien and the only thing that they love is comparing something with other completely different.<br/><br/>I liked the movie, and as a Tolkien fun, i know that Peter changed things but i he changed things for good.<br/><br/>Peter shows us that is not impossible to take things from The whole middle earth and bring more actions and other cool stuff, for example the rage against Thorin and Azog, that's great in the movie and i expect that in the other two these things would create a cool frame to watch, the 48 3d was marvelous i really liked the best 3d ever."
"redterror75","10","4","12","17 December 2012"," I love love love this movie not a movie an epic movie
","Where do i begin, this was simply an absolute joy to watch nearly 3 hours long it felt like only minutes went by. there was never a dull moment the scenery the way it was filmed was nothing short of spectacular. What a visionary Peter Jackson is to bring these wonderful books alive like this, the acting superb, middle earth superb, the shire beautiful, the elves stunning, i so want to live in the Shire. Andy Serkis never disappointing as the tragic and vile creature Golem, i will definitely go and see this again. Just go and see this movie it truly is spectacular in every way i truly have nothing negative to say about it."
"aharmas","9","4","12","16 December 2012"," Simply Spectacular
","I wasn't expecting this film would this good. Somehow, I kept thinking stretching the material into three long films would lessen its magic, but when Peter Jackson directs, we know he will raise the bar.<br/><br/>The opening scenes move a little slowly, and it's hard to keep track of who is who. There are hints of who will be central to the story, and the dinner scene muddles his introduction because of the ""festive and chaotic nature"" of the guests. Once the party gets on their journey, things pick up, and we are treated to the gorgeous vistas, the superbly choreographed action and fantasy scenes, which are rarely equaled in cinema. Soon, we encounter all types of fantastic creatures, and we get to see familiar faces along the way. Much welcome is the magical entrance by Galadiel, beautifully played by Blanchett, one of the most versatile actors working now.<br/><br/>The dwarfs' quest is to regain control of their land again, but there will be plenty of people/creatures/entities that might not be willing to cooperate or might even try to destroy them. Add to that, a long-going feud between two leaders, and the stakes are high. As Bilbo agrees to follow, he will also have his own personal challenges, and he will take possession of the mystical ring that will become center of the later trilogy. It's a fantastic scene, as we see how Bilbo grows before our eyes, and Gollum is introduced into the storyline. Once again, Serkis does a marvelous job bringing this troubled creature to life.<br/><br/>The second half of the film has by far some of the best work Jackson has done. When the movie soars, it touches your soul and restores your faith in the power of motion pictures. There is a definite sense of wonder as we see universes imagined for our enjoyment, and computer work has become so sophisticated that all works seamlessly. It's a pleasure to see the adaptation of the novel, and it makes us look forward to the next chapters of this new trilogy.<br/><br/>There might be a bit of restlessness in the audience at first, but don't despair because you will be rewarded in new and unexpected ways."
"F_Mizra","9","4","12","16 December 2012"," Another super duper Trilogy, coming up!
","The first thing that came in my mind when seeing the title at the opening credits is: WOO HOO! Finally a decade after RotK, I finally could experience another adaptation of Tolkien's Middle Earth, on the big screen. Been anticipating this since I saw the trailer like a year ago.<br/><br/>FYI, like LotR series, The Hobbit comes in three installments, with the first part being this one: ""An Unexpected Journey"". Peter Jackson still has his magnificent touch in directing the film. The opening scene tells us the tale of peaceful city of Dale and the ancient Dwarven Kingdom of Erebor. A real epic-opener! A few of the past characters reprise their roles such as Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman, Frodo and even My Prrrrecious. <br/><br/>If Lotr Part 1 shows Aragorn's forefathers, well in Hobbit Part 1, we'll be seeing Legolas and Gimli's fathers. Moreover, we'll see again The Shire, Imladris (Rivendell), Misty Mountains, and many other extraordinary landscapes. Computer or no computer, the cinematography is just brilliant.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a story about the beginning of young Bilbo Baggins' beautiful adventure to the outside world, filled with excitement, danger and mystery. He is persuaded by Gandalf to be the 14th companion of the pact of merry Dwarfs, led by Prince Thorin Oakenshield. My fa-vs are Kili and Fili. I dare you to try to remember all their names, loll. Their mission is to find a secret door into the Halls of Erebor within the Lonely Mountains; to reclaim back the city from the clutches of Smaug. Yeah, no more Sauron at least, not yet. New bad-guys are Smaug the Dragon, The Three ""Stooges"" Trolls, Azog the Orc Leader, and Witch-King of Angmar. <br/><br/>I'm very satisfied with this film. Some scenes really touch your inner lo-tr-sweet-moments, which kind of explain or elaborate the story in the original LotR series. You'll be like, ""Oh, so that what happened!"". The cast are superb. Hats off to Martin Freeman (Bilbo) and Richard Armitage (Thorin). The score also helps the mood throughout the film. Some critics say that the movie is too long. Heck, when I watch the movie, I never checked my watch because honestly, I do not want it to end<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is a must-watch for everyone, even if you're not a fan of LotR. If you have friends or family members who never known this saga, THIS is the right time to promote the franchise to them! Verdict: Two-thumbs up!"
"pirate19791979","9","4","12","16 December 2012"," Amazing
","I never thought I was going to write something here dedicated to a movie, but I must say its well worth an exception.<br/><br/>The movie has not a lesser ""feel"" than the other three LOTR movies, something that might appear doing a ""new"" movie / prequel. The movie is visual amazlingy beautiful and any misstakes cant be shown in cutting, acting or effects which really are stunning.<br/><br/>The music and soundtrack is right on spot and really speaks to your feelings on a emotional level. Raised the hair in my arms several times.<br/><br/>I first thought that some of the new characters, the dwarfs for examples were going to be like ""jar-Jar Binks"" in Star Wars. Totally totally wrong.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" really deepens the whole LOTR series a lot, and is a MUST SEE !!"
"LloydBayer","8","4","12","14 December 2012"," Jackson does it again!
","If given the option of describing this movie in one word, in all modesty, I would call it ""Spectacular"". Then again, after the multi-award winning THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, how can you expect any less? THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is a fantasy adventure of such epic proportions, it takes an accomplished and acclaimed filmmaker to lead us on a grand adventure the likes of which we are yet to experience. Even so, as the first of three installments, this film lets us experience just one-third of the proverbial iceberg. And that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Once again, adapting from J.R.R Tolkien's spellbinding tales of Middle-Earth, director Peter Jackson returns along with writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens in cinematically narrating an incredible adventure that is truly out of this world. Set as a prequel to THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, The Hobbit is adapted into a new trilogy of its own where chapter one, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, begins with the decimation of the once prosperous land of Erebor by the dragon Smaug, followed by the savage and brutal Orcs. We are then introduced to young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) a hobbit who lives alone but content with his eventless lifestyle. Bilbo's simple life changes the day he meets Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen reprising his role) and thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage), whose father was the slain king of Erebor. Together, they begin a perilous quest to reclaim Erebor and all its treasures from Smaug.<br/><br/>As the first of three instalments, there were a lot of high expectations riding on this one and I'm happy to say that the director, the grand storyteller that he is, has gone and done it again. Whether you are a Tolkien fan or not, Jackson takes everything we loved about TLOTR trilogy and breathes new life into it. Not only is there tweaking, sanding, and upgrading of various hallmarks from the original trilogy, there are lots of cliff-hangers, frequent skirmishes, and dollops of humour throughout. There is so much happening at any given time that you just don't feel the film is almost three hours long. From the fast paced story to the humorous predicaments of our little on-screen friends, to the captivating score by Howard Shore, there is little chance of a viewer's attention drifting away. To begin with, the 3D effect is immersive when required, rather than having the audience bob and weave at the swing of every axe. After the mixed reception of THE LOVELY BONES, Jackson has probably learned a valuable lesson in limiting only the best moments in visual splendour; an aspect he nails in this movie.<br/><br/>Just In case you were wondering, the best part of this prequel is just that it is one – it is a prequel in the most rewarding manner possible for fans of the original. Bilbo and his new found friends traverse various locations that are brought back from the original, but grander in scale and visual aesthetics thanks to returning cinematographer Andre Lesnie. This says a lot about the quality of art design that has gone into this film, from green carpeted landscapes to snow-capped peaks, and various mythical beasts in between. There are also a plethora of familiar characters from the previous films, some who even aide in giving this story a new spin. My favourite, and perhaps the highlight of the film, is the attention given to reintroducing Gollum the goblin and his dark kinship with the One Ring. If performance capture technology is the next best thing in films of such calibre, it is no surprise that Andy Serkis is the best in the industry. Having previously worked with Jackson as Gollum and in 2011's unbelievable RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, it's a matter of time before Serkis is duly recognised for his ground-breaking efforts in CGI. But without doubt, the film's greatest strengths are Freeman as Bilbo and McKellen as Gandalf. Freeman crackles with charisma in almost every scene, yet the transformation from a meek and insignificant hobbit to becoming the group's hero is remarkably seamless. Together with Gandalf, Freeman's Bilbo becomes the catalyst in establishing a brotherly bond with every other character – everyone just seemed to be having fun no matter what the situation. <br/><br/>THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTEED JOURNEY does not appear to break new ground, but trust Peter Jackson to show the world how a prequel should be made. Although he has caught our attention again, I suspect the best is yet to come. Watch this space."
"andreas-mykra","10","4","12","14 December 2012"," Truly one of the greastest motion pictures too date.
","Peter Jackson did it again.<br/><br/>He made me return to a middle-earth that disappeard too quickly back in 03. This movie is so beautiful with it's nature and the actors especially Martin Freeman and Ian Mckellen is superb. The opening was made beautiful with Ian Holm as old Bilbo and Frodo prepairs for Bilbos 111th birthday (Where Fellowship of the rings start) and then builds up tension. The scene with all the dwarfs in Bilbos kitchen is really funny and cute in it's own way. The things that i liked the most about the movie was probably the costumes and CGI (wich i thought would be bad cause it usually are). We get too see some good old friends like Beautiful Galadriel and Elrond, and our awesome evil wizard Saruman. The scene with the moon runes is really beautiful made. My favorite scene in the whole movie was the scene with Galadriel and Gandalf discussing Bilbo, the music in the background made it all magical. <br/><br/>Andy Serkis does once again awesome as Gollum who is improved in every aspect, a funny and dark scene with will be forever in our minds (just like the book scene). <br/><br/>The last scene when the company is up in the trees is one of the most awesomest scenes in all of Peter Jacksons movie, i was really on the edge of the seat on this one. The tension between Thorin and the orc Azog is so intence, and when Thorin decides to attack Azog and the music start, wooow the goosebumps. <br/><br/>I really can't wait for the 2nd one.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was easy the best movie of 2012, i ain't lying when i say that it is the greatest movie since 01, because this one was better than both Two towers and Return of the king. <br/><br/>It had a really bunch of humour, beauty, magic, awesome fight scenes, stayed true too the story and the appendices. Really looking forward too see how PJ is gonna make The Battle of the five armies :)<br/><br/>Really sorry for my bad English!"
"Fields201","8","4","12","14 December 2012"," ""A hobbit? I never heard of a hobbit before? Sounds like orc mischief to me!""
","I couldn't wait for this movie. I took my beautiful date Terra and my beautiful friend Gina and it would be a glorious night. But dang, is this movie long! I think it covered more than half the book!<br/><br/>In case you don't know, the movie starts with an old Bilbo narrating as that dragon Smaug attacks the dwarfs and steals their gold. Gandalf enlists young Bilbo (played brilliantly by Martin Freeman) invades his home with the dwarfs and the adventure begins. A lot of amazing things happen along the way (I especially like the scene with the trolls and the fight in the Ewok village later in the movie) but I hate to say it, but man I sure miss Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli from Lord of the Rings. I really didn't care for either of the dwarfs. I loved Bilbo and Gandalf, but these dwarfs. Ugh. Especially, Troin, or whatever his name was, he just seems so bitter and one-dimensional. He hates the elves and finds an awful place to sleep. I swear, every time he finds a place to sleep, trouble happens. He always seem to endanger them when he finds shelter. I also don't know much about the other dwarfs other than they act like children and get mad when someone is trying to help them, especially the elves. Then every single time they are in danger, you know Gandalf will be there to save them. It happens every time. Gandalf should be on this quest by himself! Just to get one more negative out of the way, some scenes drag on a little longer than they should and I almost think this could have been made into one movie.<br/><br/>With that being said, I absolutely loved Bilbo. I enjoyed every scene he was in. Martin Freeman's performance really captured what I think of when I think of a hobbit. Also his scenes with Gollum are simply fantastic. The game of riddles was handled so wonderfully, that I almost wished that was the entire film. Ian McKelland's Gandalf was also excellent, as always, and really the two characters of Bilbo and Gandalf are the core of this film.<br/><br/>If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, definitely see this movie. Despite some of my criticisms, I still think it was a really good movie. I'm looking forward to the next one in 2013."

","Long, boring, tedious...made me long for the book. The set up takes forever and the battle scenes are endless and in the end you just don't care anymore. I'd rather they had gotten killed so I could go home. The movie just ""ends"" for no particular reason and most children watching found it stupid and perplexing. Three movies out of this slim volume? A very stupid decision made for indulgent personal motives of money and self-glorification. Filming the ""Hobbit"" may be a challenge but it is a challenge Peter Jackson failed to meet. It really illustrates the story-telling genius of Ang Lee and the Life of Pi. That was an even more challenging film to make and he pulled it off brilliantly.<br/><br/>I was so, so disappointed in this boring and tedious waste of money."

","I have seen this movie at least 10 times (properly more), and I don't understand why people can't just enjoy it for what it is. I found the movie more exciting then the book, which I only read after FOTR came out in 2001. I found the introduction very helpful as I din't know anything about Erebor or its history. I also found Balin's story about Moria very useful as well as it explains a lot about Thorin's personality. There was a few moments when I felt you could really see the use of CGI but for the most part it was used well. I liked that all the dwarfs were given different looks as it made it easier to tell who was how, like when you see them from a distance apart from Gloin and Fili, from the back they were a bit hard to separate you just had to look how they were next to to tell them apart, but otherwise it was very well thought out. One thing I wish that had changed in ADR was when Thorin shouted Kili instead of Fili, even if RA said Kili on the day of filming it could have been changed while doing ADR. Overall I give the first Hobbit instalment 8/10 and wish people would stop comparing it to the book, it is what it is, like it or hate it but stop complaining about it."

","It was skeptical at first, the idea of having a Hobbit movie, after some years, prior to Lord Of The Rings. Ultimately, I came out from the theater satisfied, and without many complaints. The gripe towards this movie for me, had to be that we are aware of what is going to happen in the end, but...that does not mean we predict the events to conspire. That's what makes this tale so interesting, as well as the characters. It's a fun time with the family, and a wonderful watch. I'd suggest it to some, except maybe younger children easily frightened.

","Peter Jackson returns to Middle-Earth, as the first part of The Hobbit trilogy. Set 60 years prior to The Lord of the Rings. This time around there is a fair chunk of new faces and characters, along with some of the old ones back from Rings.<br/><br/>The dragon Smaug has taken over the Dwarven Kingdom of Erebor and forced the dwarfs out. Persistent on taking back his throne, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) is prepared to do whatever it takes to take it back.<br/><br/>Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) sees a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) sitting outside his home of Bag End, and convinces him to take an Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>This film was awe-inspiring with the multi-talented cast which included Rings actors Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Ian Holm (Older Bilbo) and Elijah Wood (Frodo) along with some new faces, and this time around, instead of a Fellowship of races, we have 13 dwarfs And a Hobbit.<br/><br/>Also back in his reprised role as Gollum, Andy Serkis takes a step back and takes up Second Unit Director, and brings a fresh look with Peter's old look to Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>The other thing I must mention is the soundtrack. There are two songs that are from the dwarven cast members and an emotional roller-coaster at the end with Tim Finns, Song of the Lonely Mountain, where he sums up the story in one simple song. True to Peter Jackson's style, this movie runs for 169 minutes, but with all the action and adventure, it doesn't feel that long at all. The actors, landscapes and soundtrack are enough to keep the audience watching.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is everything you'd expect Fun, action filled and has comedic points.

Other thing to be praised is the background music this time around by Howard Shore right from the start of the movie you feel the scent of middle earth....ahhh the music itself transports you to the magical place.To sum it all the end of the movie gives a prelude to the start of yet another adventure to come..Desolation of Smaug eagerly waiting for you."

"tjosephubert","10","3","8","24 January 2013"," A Great Adaption of The Hobbit
","I liked ""The Hobbit"" it was a great children's novel that served its purpose, and it was wildly effective at getting its points across. Many reviewers are claiming that this movie is too lighthearted and childish to be in the same level as ""LOTR"" (""Lord of the Rings""), but I disagree. What people are doing when they see this movie is comparing it to ""TFOTR"" (""The Fellowship of the Ring"") and by doing so, they are omitting everything that the original novel offered in simplicity and childishness.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is very light-hearted, somewhat childish, but by doing so, it stays true to its roots. The original story is a children's story, written for J.R.R. Tolkien's son, Christopher. That means, by default, that it is going to be a less dark, and happier. That means the story's main appeal is to be towards children. By adding jokes, and humor it makes it more childish, so that a child could comprehend--which is something that ""LOTR"" cannot say. Though this movie is long, it is by far a much simpler story that a young person could relate to, but even more so, it is a story that adults can relate to as well. Before people say that the movie was ruined by its childish jokes, just remember that the source material is just as childish."
"austin-takahashi","5","3","8","12 January 2013"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - 2.5 Stars
","Let me get things straight first. I enjoyed ""An Expected Journey"" as I was viewing it. From the film's first half hour, I could tell that it wasn't going to be an event as grand and glorious as any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, which was just fine by me. Though weighed down by several substantial flaws, I felt a mild satisfaction when the credits started to roll. The verdict of a movie reviewer should always be based on the immediate experience, and on that notion I should label ""An Unexpected Journey"" a success. But my later convictions overruled the other, and I realize that I cannot award a positive rating to a movie that could have easily been great but chose not to.<br/><br/>The three volumes that comprised Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" were made into three different films. That's over 1,300 pages translated into nine hours of film. And while ""An Unexpected Journey"", 2013's ""The Desolation of the Smaug"", and 2014's ""There and Back Again"" are the components of another planned trilogy, there are all based on a single Tolkien novel, 1937's ""The Hobbit"", which is only around 300 pages long. Does Peter Jackson really have enough material for a trilogy? We don't know yet, but judging on this first installment, it seems that he will stretch his way to his second billion-dollar franchise. Every single sequence in this introductory film is prolonged, and several other scenes feel unnecessary. The story itself is compelling, but the deadweight pacing prevents us from being compelled.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/hobbit-unexpected-journey/"
"TheFilmFanatic1","5","3","8","11 January 2013"," Why it truly was an unexpected journey
","I am a fan of the Lord of The Rings Trilogy, they're truly magnificent and convey a almost real-life feel that reading the books gives you. However, the Hobbit failed to match up to the trilogy. It was unexpected considering the hype that it got, it fell almost flat on it's face. With the exception of a couple of scenes, and tremendous acting from Martin Freeman and Sir Ian McKellen the Hobbit was rather elongated. It seemed to go on forever and I feel that this was due to the fact that the book is a small book (in comparison to the Lord Of the Rings). Peter Jackson's attention to detail cost him dearly, the plot just seemed to fade out during the film. If you're a Lord of The Rings fan give it a try, but I was immensely disappointed with it."
"flosoom","2","3","8","10 January 2013"," brilliant pictures, horrible plot
","After Peter Jackson had made the Lord of the Rings in such a magnificent way, following the the plot of the books very satisfyingly, I was really looking forward to go see the Hobbit. I expected to see another epic movie. Very unfortunately, Jackson seemingly thought of himself as the new Tolkien this time and adjusted the story freely according to his wishes.<br/><br/>The movie starts very promising. The Intro is amazing and the landscapes and cities as well as the costumes look perfect as we know it from the Lord of the Rings. Still the first scene, where the dwarfs are introduced, is a joy, not too funny, not too serious and the dwarfs look truly amazing.<br/><br/>But where the journey starts, and therefore the actual movie, the enjoyment ends. It starts a story that jumps between three plots that are poorly connected and from which two have nothing to do with the Hobbit. It seems that Peter Jackson wants to link the Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings and to some other, as far as I remember my Tolkien readings, totally invented story about some vengeful Ork Lord. This is completely unnecessary for telling the story of the Hobbit, but would be okay, if it would make the movie more interesting. However the opposite is the case. It makes the story slowly limp forward from one original scene to the next, so the bored spectator asks himself how this movie will ever come to an end. The only (desired?) effect is, that the story doesn't fit into one movie anymore and three movies had to be produced out of a book, that is thinner than any one of the three parts of the Lord of the Rings. Additionally, with few exceptions, the single scenes are done very badly, including the ones that follow the original plot. The action is ridiculously over exaggerated and there is a lot of badly placed comedy in the scenes. By that, the last excitement that one had when reading the book, gets lost.<br/><br/>Summa summarum, I went to the cinema with the expectation to see an epic movie, was delighted by a great beginning, started to be inpatient as the story would not go on, got bored after a while, became angry when the movie stopped without anything had really happened and left the cinema very disappointed. This movie is not epic at all, it is ridiculous! Shame on Peter Jackson for ruining that story in such a way, having such great technique and being able to create such great images of middle-earth. I wish nobody would go watch the 2nd and 3rd anymore. But probably I'll go myself nevertheless and get disappointed again."
"NotMoreMovies","7","3","8","9 January 2013"," A Must See for Lovers of the Genre!
","I'll begin by saying this -- I love this genre, but I'm not a ""fanboy."" So this review is not completely unbiased, but I'll do my best. My main issue is how much I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003). This review will be based only on my viewing of this movie. First off, everything is beautiful...the acting, the scenery (both real and fake), the cinematography, you name it...amazing! Now the bad...the pacing is awful. It gets very slow and monotonous at times (perhaps the book did too, I don't know). Some of the character interactions appear stiff and forced...even hurried at times. But in all the experience is well worth the price of admission. However, if you are not a fan of Tolkein's books or the first three movies, I would not advise this movie. Unlike the first movie back in 2001, you'll be lost and bored if you go into this movie unprepared."
"giannaharness","10","3","8","6 January 2013"," One of the best films ever made!
","I grew up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and am a huge fan of the films as well as the books. When I heard that they were going to make the Hobbit into a film I was overwhelmed with excitement but questioned if it was going to live up to the standards of Lord of the Rings. However, when I heard that the Hobbit was going to be directed by Peter Jackson, I had complete faith in the films success. The fact that this film was going to be in 3D made it 10x more intriguing and exciting on the day my family and I decided to go and watch it in the cinema. I expected to get an amazing and fantastic film, just as good as Lord of the Rings and thats exactly what I got. One of my favourite things about this film is the fact that its an adventure, action and comedy film, and is not just one genre but multiple which attracts a vars variety of the public. I actually found the Hobbit to be a bit more humorous and not as serious as the Lord of the Rings trilogy which defiantly helped with the films success. <br/><br/>The special effects are marvelous. In fact, I think that this film should win an Oscar for the best special effects. There were so many different effects that were very dramatic and fascinating to watch. In some action films, the special effects and action can become too much and can subsequently bore the audience. However in this film, the special effects and action were very realistic and done to a perfect amount. <br/><br/>It is incredible how much work went into the film. I was so inlove and obsessed with this film that I went out of my way to watch the making of it. I was astounded of how much effort and time went into this film. Every little detail was vital for this films success. Middle Earth looked so realistic and as if it had once existed or does exist. The amount of work that went into building the different kingdoms and places of Middle Earth such as the Shire and Rivendale is astonishing. The landscapes and dramatic scenery on this film has also motivated me to fly to New Zealand. I especially want to visit the piece of land where the Shire was built because every detail was worked onto it to make it look the way it did in the film. Such as, they had to grow flowers and build solid cottages, as well as place the hobbits and farm animals there too. <br/><br/>I think Peter Jackson has proved that he is the best director to have ever lived. He has so much talent and determination. His love toward the books really inspired him to make the Hobbit into a masterpiece. He put so much effort into this and worked extremely hard. He inspires me to do and accomplish what I love. He put so much love and knowledge into this film to make it into probably the best film ever made (AS WELL AS LORD OF THE RINGS)! <br/><br/>Not to mention, the acting is brilliant as it was in Lord of the Rings despite some different and new characters such as the dwarfs. I think Martin Freeman did a fantastic job portraying Bilbo Baggins. As usual, Ian McKellen did a fantastic job as his role as Gandulf. And of course Andy Serkis was AMAZING as his role as Golemn and really knows how to portray his character and his voice. The dwarfs are also great and amusing characters. However for me, Peter Jackson did the best job from everyone working on this film because he showed dedication and determination and encouraged all the actors and actresses to perform how they did on the film. <br/><br/>Extremely well done, you have made me believe in Middle Earth once more!"
"yorkiebard","10","3","8","5 January 2013"," The EPIC to serve us all
","The heart that carries this movie is much more than the extension to the RINGS saga it may seem. The depth of landscape is on such a grand scale that it dwarfs (no pun intended) any other epic. The sfx skills have taken leaps and bounds to convince that the actors have genuinely taken reduction pills? A gripping story line pretty much blows away the doubters that just one book couldn't carry it. Martin Freeman gives a great performance of an innocent caught up in something beyond his little world. Even the opening sequence of the dragon attack was way beyond any other start to a movie. This wasn't just a bunch of guys beset with Fantasy problems, it was a quest beyond all quests. One of the few films I could happily have immediately watched again. A great accomplishment, well done Peter."
"liamfairweather14","9","3","8","4 January 2013"," A Long expected Masterpiece
","*CONTAINS SPOILERS*<br/><br/>So, as with many of the reviewers's of the hobbit, I'm a massive LOTR fan and i have been waiting for the hobbit for many years. When it finally came round to the couple of days before the hobbit i was worried it wouldn't live up to expectation, as many critics were giving mixed reviews. Here's what i thought.....<br/><br/>First of all ill talk about the toning. the hobbit comes across as a more childlike story of middle earth and is less serious in some areas than LOTR however I was completely fine with this as this is how the book is written so Jackson decided to stick with the toning of the book (perfectly fine). I thought he managed a brilliant balance between satisfying people like me who wanted some good action scenes and some more serious areas with some more childlike areas to bring in a wider audience to middle earth. Many people who criticise the hobbit say: ""its so far-fetched"" or ""too light hearted and not very intense"". Well the fact that the hobbit is toned to slightly younger audience answers that perfectly. I think many people forget that about the hobbit and are constantly comparing it to the darker LOTR trilogy.Overall Jackson does a brilliant job of toning it to a slightly younger audience while still satisfying many LOTR fans like me. WELL DONE PETER JACKSON!<br/><br/>Next thing, i would like to point out is the soundtrack. now, we all love the soundtrack on LOTR and i was intrigued to see how the same composers would handle the hobbit. My personal opinion is they did a magnificent job. Howard shore and his company of musicians pulled off another beautiful soundtrack that sent chills down my spine every time i saw the dwarfish company travelling across the stunning New Zealand countryside. He also does a great job of mixing several LOTR tracks into the film to satisfy again, the LOTR addicts! What i admire about the music in this film is that it uses several soundtracks of the LOTR tune to remind us of the close relationship between the two but is cautious not to use loads of soundtracks from LOTR or to use the main, fellowship theme anywhere in the movie and although i adore the fellowship theme, i agree that this was a wise decision so it doesn't blend too much into LOTR, we have to remember the hobbit is an entirely different trilogy to LOTR. SO overall, another brilliant job with the sound tracking<br/><br/>Next the pacing. The pacing has been the big problem for many people and countless critics have complained about the movies drawn out-scenes. Overall, i didn't find this in hardly anywhere in the film and thought it was paced perfectly. I too, was sceptical on making 3 movies out of the hobbit. but after watching i can honestly say i had practically no problems with the pacing of the movie, with a few exceptions. First exception, is the scene where Dwalin is recounting the story of Azog vs Thorin where he chops off Azogs arm. The battle scene was brilliant and makes me soooo desperate to see the battle of the five armies come to the screen however i did feel that scene was more drawn out than it needed to be and was necessary to be the length it was. The only other example is at the start with the light hearted shire gossip between Bilbo and Frodo. while it was nice to see Elijah wood back as Frodo, it did seem unnecessary to go on for the time it did. Other than that, i thought it was absolutely fine.<br/><br/>However, as much as i Loved the experience of the hobbit, i did pick out some small criticisms during the film. First note, the CGI. i love CGI as much as the next film junkie, but in the hobbit some of the CGI and colour correction looked a bit too colourful which made the scenery look slightly fake. the best example of this is the last scene of the film where we see the thrush flying around the mountain and knocking on a shell casing. to me, that looked too animated and also when Jackson cut between panning CGI scenes of middle earth and CGI scenes, it sometimes was easy to tell the difference. But this was on a fairly small scale and isn't too noticeable in the film. Also, a couple of scenes in the 48fps looked a tad blurred and were hard to follow at the start as my eyes adjusted. after that though, the experience was fine and never once thought about the 48fps. On a side not for the 48fps, i did not hate the experience nor love the experience as i didn't really notice any difference, i had no problems though with the experience aside from that which i just mentioned.<br/><br/>General Summary So, i came into the cinema with big expectations and a longing to be reunited with middle earth and all my favourite characters. I felt Jackson reached my expectations and provided an excellent visual experience with lots of good and well made action scenes to more childlike humour and some middle earth drama. I take my hat off to you Peter Jackson, you made an awesome start to the trilogy. Fingers crossed for the next two films...."
"jameshspanos","9","3","8","4 January 2013"," The visit back to Middle Earth that we've longed for
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the golden ticket that takes us back to Middle Earth where we can once again immerse ourselves in this deep, intricate and magical world. The Hobbit is a trilogy that brings to screen J.R.R Tolkin's first novel of Middle Earth and is the prequel to the much acclaimed Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Directed by Peter Jackson and featuring some returning stars The Hobbit is a fantastic film that lets you take a dip in the pool that is the world of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>Ian McKellar returns as Gandalf the Grey and brings with him the same charm, wit and pure awesomeness fans of LOTR will love. He is brilliant and no one will be disappointed to see him back on the big screen. Martin Freeman plays a 'young' Bilbo Baggins and this is really his movie. It is his story and he does a fantastic job at portraying Bilbo. Bilbo was fantastically casted and fantastically portrayed. Richard Armitrage plays the main dwarf Thorin and is everything a Tolkin fan will want in a Thorin. One of my qualms with this movie is that most of the dwarfs don't get any backstory/screen time and although this will not be an issue once the trilogy is complete and I know that getting backstory/screen time for 13 dwarfs in an already 3 hour movie is impossible, it was something to note.<br/><br/>There are cameos from Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett as Elrond and Lady Galadriel as well as Christopher Lee as Saruman. Elijah Wood also makes a cameo as the beloved Frodo Baggins and although these cameos can seem a little too indulgent at times they are still valued and bring completeness to the plot.<br/><br/>Of course there is one person left to mention and that is Andy Serkis returning as Gollum. Serkis steals the show and is absolutely phenomenal in this movie. I can't stress that enough. He brings one of the, if not the highlight of the movie in the 'Riddle Scene' and brings a different side to Gollum. In LOTR we see Gollum as conniving and menacing but here we see a Gollum who we feel genuine pity for.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything for me this movie is too long. If you didn't know, the saga was originally meant to be two movies long, but mid production was extended to three. This in my opinion is a little bit of a cash grab as this movie felt as though it was an extended edition of the movie, meant for the hardcore fans and there are a couple of completely irrelevant scenes that could have easily been omitted but weren't for the sake of extending the movie. The length of the movie wouldn't be a problem but the first 90 odd minutes can be painfully slow and it is only really the second act of the movie that provides us with quality that should have been seen throughout. In the grand scheme of things (3 movies and potentially 9 hours of movie) I can understand the need for a slow build but it could have, and should have been executed better. LOTR: The Two Towers was had hardly any action before the Battle of Helm's Deep but it wasn't slow and painful and everything had relevance. That said any fan of the series won't mind too much, but for a large proportion of the population, it will be a little too long. Peter Jackson does a marvelous job in directing this movie and it is shot beautifully while Howard Shore produced yet again a truly beautiful score for the movie.<br/><br/>Finally before my final verdict I have to touch on the whole 48fps thing. I initially saw the movie in 24fps and went to see it in 48fps afterwards before returning to see it once again in 24fps. For those who don't know; movies are normally filmed in 24fps and this is what we are all use to. Peter Jackson decided to film The Hobbit in 48fps which basically means that instead of seeing 24 photos per second, you see 48. This is meant to increase immersion but unfortunately does the exact opposite. Sometimes the movie looks spectacular and at points actually took my breath away. Sometimes people look so realistic you think you are there. But more often than not movement looks jerky and sped up and instead of making you feel like you're there in the world, it makes you feel like you are there watching the movie being physically filmed (which is a bad thing). Also, the blend between CGI and real stuff is lessened and again takes you out of the experience. If you're only going to see this once, see it in 24fps because 48fps can definitely taint your opinion of the film and your overall experience.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic movie that while unable to completely recapture the magic of LOTR, is still an absolutely brilliant movie and in my top three for the year. Definitely a must see that won't disappoint especially if you're already a fan of Middle Earth."

","I really struggled with what to rate this movie. I was such a fan of the Cartoon Version that I couldn't wait for this to come out! I'm so totally disappointed!! Let me explain, the movie itself goes along with pretty much the same story as the good old cartoon. Adding quite a bit of detail that the rather short cartoon version missed. So I did overall enjoy watching the story being retold by real people and it was good to see the my favorite wizard, but the ending. Well, obviously there is going to be a second one. I myself, somehow, did not know going into the theater to see this that there was going to be a second. Who knows maybe somehow third movie before I get to see the full end. Dammit, besides flashbacks there's just barely even a dragon in it. I was left totally hanging!! Sucked! Had I known this I would have saved myself the time, hassle, and money. Really wish I would have just waited for them to all come out on DVD or blu-ray and rented them at redbox or something. So whomever is to blame for that ending... well I won't write what I want to say on IMDb but I'm sure others can guess what I'm thinking! I hope less people will go see these, leave ya hanging, type of movies and just rent them so they knock it off!

"michael_the_nermal","7","3","8","1 January 2013"," A Great Adventure
","MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>I admit that I have not read the novel on which this film is based. With that in mind, I will say that I really enjoyed this movie. This is one of the few movies I've seen in many years that I have really liked. What I liked most was how Peter Jackson decided not merely to adapt ""The Hobbit,"" but weave its story into the narrative of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and of J.R.R. Tolkien's general mythology about Middle-Earth. I understand ""The Hobbit"" was written for children as a straightforward adventure story, and that ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a much more gravid tale, full of dark themes and dire consequences. Some reviewers have argued that making ""The Hobbit"" into a three-part epic like ""The Lord of the Rings"" was completely unnecessary and nothing more than a cash-in; I disagree. Jackson did not want to go for a simple adaptation, but rather continue to explore the general mythology of ""Lord of the Rings,"" in particular how the hobbits got involved with the One Ring in the first place. Stretching the film out to more than one part allows Jackson to explore the Tolkien mythology more fully--albeit with his own touches added in. ""The Hobbit"" is *mostly* about the story in the children's novel, but it is so much more: it is about the titanic battle between good and evil in Middle-Earth, and of the story of its sentient beings over the course of that fictional land's history: the Dwarfs, the Elves, and the humans. It is clear Jackson blended the children's ""Hobbit"" with the information he could coherently gather from appendix from the ""Lord of the Rings,"" which explores the mythology much more thoroughly than the novel did. The result is actually satisfactory.<br/><br/>Jackson understood that, as a children's book, ""The Hobbit"" had some light moments not found in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and expressed this well in his film. The trolls in ""The Hobbit"" are much more comical and less intimidating than the monsters in ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Gandalf and the dwarfs escape from the goblins in a scene that mirrors the Fellowship's escape from Khazad Dumb, but the stakes are lower, and the Goblin King is a bit of a buffoon, a clownish, unimposing parody of the Balrog. The goblins are not scary; the Goblin King and the goblins of the Rankin Bass ""Hobbit"" are much more terrifying (especially the Goblin King *shudder!*). Gollum is back, and he plays a central role. I won't spoil *too* much, but the themes about mercy and compassion that I though *should* have been expressed in ""The Lord of the Ring"" movies are beautifully expressed here, actually keeping with the text of the ""Lord of the Ring"" novels. While more light-hearted than ""The Lord of the Ring"" movies, Jackson's ""Hobbit"" does have some somber moments, and tries to make connections with the earlier films, particularly with the malignancy permeating Mirkwood. The battle between the dwarfs and goblins at the door of Khazad Dumb provides an obvious link to the greater mythology of Middle-Earth Jackson tried to show in ""Lord of the Rings."" Jackson is insistent on showing ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" as companion pieces about the history of Middle-Earth than two completely different standalone pieces. It looks like he is successful.<br/><br/>I recommend ""The Hobbit;"" it will please fans of the ""Lord of the Rings,"" so long as they keep in mind that the film is considerably less dark and contains less gravity in the plot line than ""Lord of the Rings."" I look forward to Jackson's next installment of ""The Hobbit."""

","I'm waiting for the next episode of this Soap Opera, because that's what it looks like in HFR. Skip that terrible miscarriage of video technology. Don't need the realism. Don't want the realism. It's freaking Middle Earth, for crying out loud, I don't want to see the glue in Gandalf's wig.<br/><br/>Couple that with a story that is paced at the speed of continental drift, stuffed with so much extra material not found in the book, for the sole purpose of squeezing as much money out of the viewing public as possible, by forcing three movies from the source material.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I liked the IMAX 3D. I don't get headaches and vertigo. Generally, if 3D surpasses Tron Legacy, I'm usually cool. Enjoy it, because it won't be around much longer, and I'm cool with that, too.<br/><br/>Overall it was watchable and enjoyable, if you have a couple of drinks before, and you don't see it too late. My wife fell asleep, but she does that during a lot of things."
"s171","7","3","8","22 December 2012"," Great film, not as magical as FOTR.
","I went into this film with too much expectation, and a strange sense of nervousness. My first and only viewing so far was in 2D, my preferred viewing dimension for movies, and needless to say I was not disappointed. As a huge fan of Tolkien and the lotr film trilogy this was easily my most anticipated movie event, perhaps with the exception of return of the king pre release.<br/><br/>I found it quite hard to take in, I don't know if anyone else had a sense of this. I felt like my eyes were working overtime trying to keep up with the high definition figures and landscapes sprawling across the screen, trying to drink in every detail but admittedly failing. I think I will glean more from each viewing after now, and start to let go of the little hang ups which nagged me after viewing.<br/><br/>I have no argument with Pete Jackson and his team, they did a spectacular job on the lotr trilogy, and on this, easily my favourite films ever.<br/><br/>That said, I found some things were a little off. Details which would probably seem ridiculous to anybody who wasn't a big fan of Tolkien lore, but small details such as the way gandalf turns the trolls to stone, the way in which bilbo meets gollum immediately after entering the mountain. The way gandalf doesn't behead the great goblin, and the way in which bilbo finds the ring.<br/><br/>I felt that there was a little too much emphasis placed on Azog the 'pale orc', who doesn't really feature in the book. One moment of the film I found a little bit cringeworthy, when Thorin is in the jaws of a Warg, and Bilbo charges down Azog and saves him? That doesn't really add up in any way.<br/><br/>The dwarfs themselves I found a little challenging, but I'm sure I will accept this over time, though they did not look anything like I imagined they would.<br/><br/>Not to sound like all I have are complaints surrounding this movie, but I was disappointed in the under-use of prosthetics in this movie. I understand that CGI makes everything much easier these days, but that was one of the thing that was great about lotr, all the orcs and the antagonists such as Lurtz and Gothmog and the Nazgul were real men, fantastically made-up and modified. They offered a real sense of fear, and danger. A man will always be scarier than a computer generated image. This is where Azog, though impressive, fell a little short, in my opinion.<br/><br/>These small issues aside, I was blown away by the spectacle. Ian McKellan was simply brilliant as Gandalf, some of the best casting ever right there. Martin Freeman was almost as good, and Andy Serkis' Gollum is quite frankly without equal in non-human character portrayal in film. The pioneering work of motion capture CGI, and arguably the centre-piece of this movie, and the previous trilogy.<br/><br/>All in all, a wonderful cinema experience. It was far from perfect, but it doesn't matter really. It will please everyone. Can't wait for parts 2 and 3."

","I liked the LOTR films but I wouldn't say I was a fan. I've only watched the first and the third entry more than once and haven't read any of the books or even spent any time trying to learn more about the characters or the world it takes place in. All of that being said my expectations weren't very high for this film. It just seems like a way to cash on the original trilogies success. My opinion of prequels is that even the story was all that great they would have told it the first time around. Well I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised The Hobbit feels like it takes place in the same universe, which it does but it's an all new experience altogether. I found it a little difficult to follow the storyline but I really did enjoy the film. Here are the positives the film is well paced and shot beautifully. The spfx are top notch, Smegal has never looked so terrifying and awe inspiring and the characters although not as developed as the ones in the other films are interesting and engaging enough in that you want to know more about their story. As for the negatives the film isn't nearly as engaging as the first or third LOTR film of which it will be compared. The characters and storyline aren't developed enough to be fully engaged and the film feels anticlimactic as they have decided to divide it into three films. The film also has awkward lapses into unnecessary humor that just feel out of place and their is some questionable directorial touches that veer on the cheesy. All in all it's a solid film with promise of other films that will only heighten this ones overall effect. Kudos to Peter Jackson for pulling off a prequel that feels fresh instead a dull retread of the same. ***.5/5"

"ron-sasso","1","5","17","30 December 2012"," Disappointment - Not in the Same League as the LOTR Trilogy
","First, I should point out that I am not a big LOTR fan. I enjoyed the three LOTR movies and found them to be extremely well done---it's just not my favorite fare. I expected something similar from the Hobbit, entertainment and a well done film. I was greatly disappointed.<br/><br/>Now my kids are LOTR fans and have read the books. They enjoyed the film far more than I did but they had some problems with story where it digressed from the book.<br/><br/>First of all, the pacing was at times like a dragon in hibernation. Not much happening and slow, drawn out exposition that could have been covered in half the time. It seemed that battle sequences were inserted to make sure that no one actually fell asleep during the long sluggish scenes. <br/><br/>I find it very difficult to imagine that this is going to be made into three, three-hour films. I believe a sub 300 page book can be done in the length of one movie but alas that may impact revenues. <br/><br/>An example of something that deviated from the book is the pale orc. Well, supposedly they got him out of the appendix. However, in the appendix it mentions that he died after his arm was cut off in battle and then he was beheaded. Hence the surprise at Oakenshield, the lead dwarf's surprise that the pale orc was still alive. Obviously he hadn't read the changed script. The added dialogue of ""I'm going to kill you"" which is repeated about a dozen times by the pale orc is simply fascinating (sarcasm noted). Tolkien must have been rolling over in his grave over that. <br/><br/>The battle scenes were well done---but dragged on far longer than needed. It almost seemed that the goal was to make the movie three hours long instead of the goal being to tell a part of the story.<br/><br/>I should note, I would give this movie six stars but I gave it ""one star"" because right now the general IMDb rating is way over-inflated (in my opinion) at 8.4 stars. <br/><br/>Regardless, this does not deserve the hype that it has gotten and does not have nearly the same impact as the LOTR trilogy does."
"streetrodfan","6","5","17","21 December 2012"," Well my family thought it was on par with the original trilogy I didn't
","The over the top complex action scenes were a little too Goofy for me. I am calling them Goofy because they reminded me of a Goofy cartoon where the action is so ridiculous and out there that it's almost laughable. The tone of the first few films had a more ""real"" feel for me. The action was more suspenseful and ""epic"". The action in this movie is like a mixture of mission impossible and the matrix. Maybe not as crazy as the matrix but I'm trying to get my point across.<br/><br/>One scene Bilbo falls like 100 feet grabs a rope and falls again and is miraculously unharmed. Characters go from being immortal to mortal it seems, it's like a cartoon that's what action adventure films have become. Turn off your brains because in action adventure films the hero can now jump 100 feet to the ground and run away on the soles of his feet. I'm not really into how the action/ adventure genre is going.<br/><br/>There is a scene under ground where they are crossing bridges and like a cartoon they jump from bridge to bridge and all these implausible scenes. It was just too over the top for me and it wasn't as epic for me and didn't have as clever of dialog , or as deep of scenes.Speaking of which, I was only emotionally moved once in the film and LOTR I find to be a masterpiece that is emotionally moving and complex throughout.<br/><br/>This film is not complex, the characters succumb to fart humor and ball sack humor and the dialog is no where near the dialog of the first trilogy. More of the same, giant spiders, Baggins, butter flies turning into Birds . Slow motion fight scenes... When it was different it was just a generic action / adventure film full of tedious and ridiculous action scenes. I feel that the original 3 films had mostly plausible action scenes, with mostly mortal characters. This film I really have to suspend my disbelief as birds toss characters around 100s of feet apart playing catch. A scene that I don't understand, it seems that anything they did in this film that could be senselessly over done to make it more exciting was senselessly over done...<br/><br/>The birds show up to carry them away but for some reason play catch with one another...<br/><br/>The first films had a beautiful score and was filmed beautifully. The cinematography was fantastic. This film looks polished, and pretty but it really lacks the soul the first 3 had. I was never taken back by this movie . Watching this film I had no serene moments where I had to stop and think how beautiful it was or how epic it was. I think that is because this film doesn't really take moments for reflection and to make you think . There are no real scenic moments where you have time to take it all in. The magic just isn't there for me when there is focus on the characters there's not a lot of substance. Pile on top of that the characters are completely predictable as stated in this review some of them are very obvious.<br/><br/>The ""cool "" character almost dies, but is miraculously better later with no real signs of injury. He tells Bilbo that he doesn't belong in their fellowship and then predictably later says he was wrong...<br/><br/>The characters are mostly 1 dimensional and typical characters you would find in various fantasy stories. Bilbo is a little more interesting to follow but his scenes don't really add that much to the story as a whole when looking at the entire franchise as a whole.<br/><br/>It doesn't feel as ""triumphant "" as the original 3, I wasn't as emotionally moved or inspired by this film as I was the first trilogy.<br/><br/>But, some of the characters are relate-able, which is a good thing obviously.<br/><br/>Of course the locations made beautiful by the original 3 films reappear in this one to be beautiful again. I'm not really absorbed or excited about the ""new story"". I'm not into it at all, what so ever. I'm not even fully sure what it's all about or why I should really care. It seems to just be filler for the original story.<br/><br/>""Let's make it because we can..."" The original story is a short story and I feel that the movie is almost pointless and what they've come up with as a movie doesn't seem truly appropriate or necessary to the franchise. It's entertaining enough so I give it a 7, I could never give this film a 10...<br/><br/>There is not a lot of suspense when you think about the major character because we all know that he's alive later on. As for the other characters they were never in any true harm and I never expected that they'd die. And the entire film goes on where the entire cast is left alive and well. One character gets injured but being the ""cool"" one we know he's not going to die , as he's the leader of their group more or less any ways he's a needed character.<br/><br/>The old actors are a bit tried reprising their roles and a bit too obvious in many instances. What could be an opportunity to learn more about characters is wasted in over stating the obviousness of how their characters will turn out. Saruman plays a obviously evil character and Gandalf plays some one who is clueless.<br/><br/>Corniness and predictability pursues. Clichés..."
"b_havag","6","5","17","19 December 2012"," I liked it, but...
","That's sadly mainly because of my enjoyment to be back in the universe by Tolkien on screen. There was another IMDb-reviewer here who called it ""enjoyable but flawed"", and that is exactly what it is. I gave it an 8/10 because I loved to be back in the world of Tolkien and Jackson but as a movie it isn't more than a 6, and here's why:<br/><br/>It seems to me that Jackson was too interested in portraying the appendices. Remember that the Lord of the Rings was adapted into a modern classic in 11 hours (in the extended versions) and The Hobbit is a book somewhere around 10 times shorter. Why don't just adapt it into one film 160 minutes in the theatrical version and then go for a 200 minutes (or so) extended cut? Then he probably could've found a way to adapt the appendices as a link between The Hobbit and LotR for next Christmas. If the second movie had become a failure as a result of difficulty in doing so, at least we would've had a great movie about The Hobbit in stead of three somewhat more or less mediocre. I can't see a way the two next ones can avoid the same narrative problem.<br/><br/>The problem is that unlike LotR, it is only an enjoyable experience for the Tolkien-fans, not others, because it simply isn't great. The narrative doesn't fit together, it feels like more action than Tolkien and a breaking point in such a lightweight novel is wrong. This movie will sustain Tolkien fans, not increase them, as the great previous trilogy did.<br/><br/>Still, some of its parts are great. I loved the riddle-scene with Gollum as well as most of what happens before the unexpected journey, and I can't say it wasn't fun seeing the White Council at work even though it is part of the destruction of the Hobbit-story. It fits in my vision about an appendices-movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Reviewed from the perspective of a film-enthusiast, which I am, it is a 5 or a 6 for the reasons mentioned above. It isn't cinematic greatness in other aspects than the wrapping (visually). For a starved Tolkien enthusiast it is a 9, also for the reasons above. Together it is a 7,5 for now."
"nitz_angel","7","5","17","14 December 2012"," Too Much
","You already know what you are going to get when its more or less the same cast and crew as The Lord Of The Rings, you get excellence in cinematography. The back drop is as breathtaking as always but the story is a mish-mash of The Hobbit and other Tolkien stories and it way too long and all over the place. There were parts that I was even a bit bored. I personally didn't think that this book should have turned into 3 feature films, one movie would have been enough, but I guess the studios got greedy and wanted more golden eggs. The results was an OK movie. its not bad by any standards, it had epic moments, but its too much."
"MacacoBanditi","7","5","17","14 December 2012"," Doesn't disappoint
","""Expectations"" is the name of the game for this movie. If you are expecting a 'LOTR reloaded' kind of flick, you will certainly come out whining. However if you keep in mind that the spirit of the original book is completely different to the epic-to-end-all-epics tone of LOTR (in fact, The Hobbit is a story that JRR Tolkien improvised to put his children to sleep), then you will enjoy this journey.<br/><br/>It is hard not to enjoy a movie made with so much attention to detail and such impressive visuals. The cinematography is flawless and the photography is stunning. Doesn't remind you at all of a little chubby someone who recently sold his company to Disney and can only shoot flat angles and shot, reverse-shot dialogs. No, this is top-class film-making and story-telling. I particularly enjoyed the extensive use of the original fictional languages by the characters, it was a wonderful touch by PJ.<br/><br/>On the cons side, you can say that some scenes drag on unnecessarily, the run time could have easily been cut to 2 hours with no harm to the story. Some characters from the LOTR are shoehorned in this one with no particular reason other than referencing the original trilogy. And finally the chase in the caves seems more fitting to a video game than a motion picture.<br/><br/>Although this is far from a masterpiece, it still is a very enjoyable movie, quite possibly the best of 2012 hands down. If you know what to expect you won't be disappointed. Looking forward to the next installment."
"thethumbthing","5","5","17","13 December 2012"," mixed feelings...
","I'm a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the cinematic quality was like a painting in every scene, it was a master piece to say the least and winning the Academy awards once all 3 films were screened was inevitable. <br/><br/>I saw The Hobbit on 12.12.12 as a friend of mine was chewing at the bit to see it. The first thing i noticed was the cinematic values... some scenes were like looking at cheap video, this is due to the frame rate that was used, it looked too clean and as a result the cinematic quality of The Hobbit fell short of the LOTR films.<br/><br/>Why did they choose to go 3D? I don't get it. OK, the 3D effect itself looks very 3D and gives that feeling of distance between the characters and foreground and background, but the frame rate seems to completely take away the cinematic quality we saw in LOTR. When we both came out of the cinema we both complained of head aches, my head ache lasted the entire day! I think this was due to all that was going on on the screen, my brain was trying to make sense of what i was seeing... i guess. I am not saying the film was crap, what i am saying is the choices made cinematically were perhaps not necessary, a bit like polishing firewood."
"amyluna","5","6","22","15 December 2012"," Peter Jackson Dumbs Down Tolkein for Video Game Generation
","As a huge fan of the LOTR trilogy, I have to say first that I loved the High Frame Rate 3D format which created Middle Earth On Steroids and made me not mind so much how repetitive most of the film was of LOTR elements because we got to see them more up close and personal. So I would definitely recommend seeing it in HFR 3D, otherwise it's kind of redundant.<br/><br/>Second, this film has a huge gross out factor that was not Tolkein's doing. If you like jokes about bird poop, belching, butt scratching and nose boogers, this is the film for you! Add in an ad nauseum (pun intended) amount of over the top traumatizing CGI battle scenes (this film is rated PG-13, really?!?) and you figure the target audience for this film is 5-10 year old boys who play video games all day.<br/><br/>All in all, a huge step down from the LOTR in class and message. In LOTR we are led to believe that Elves are kinda sorta more evolved than Dwarfs because they are into things like peace and beauty and consciousness instead of food and gold and drunkeness (Dwarfs). But I guess you can't have a movie starring thirteen Dwarfs that disses Dwarf culture so in this film it's the Elves that get made fun of, being made out to look like prissy hippies. Great...<br/><br/>I do believe Tolkein is turning over in his grave...(sigh)<br/><br/>Of course it's a special effects spectacular. The epic panoramas of Middle Earth are breathtaking. And there are some shots in the film (like Bilbo's first look at Gollum) that are genius direction. <br/><br/>But for perverting Tolkein's message 180 degrees and glorifying violence and dumbing down the message, I have to give this film a very conflicted 5 star rating."
"jdesando","Null","6","22","12 December 2012"," It's fun, but you can bet your Bilbo it's long.
","Director Peter Jackson has few equals when it comes to special effects, especially the digital kind. This adapted prequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is rampant with the effects as Bilbo Bagins (Martin Freeman), the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and a motley crew of thirteen dwarfs (not as cute by far as Snow White's), under the leadership of Thorin (Richard Armitrage), go searching for the lost dwarf kingdom of Eredor to reclaim it from the dragon Smaug. <br/><br/>It's an arguably long opening sequence, where Gandalf tries to enlist the happy Bilbo to become a ""burglar"" to win back the Lonely Mountain, to bring the dwarfs home. In this regard Tolkien and Jackson embrace the theme common to many kiddie lit tomes: ""There's no place like home."" The set pieces are almost always about fighting, be it stone monsters as large as mountains or wolves the size of elephants. Although I didn't get to see the much heralded 48 frames-per-second digital cinematography (as opposed to the usual 24), I did have 3-D, used to good effect as much detritus is thrown against the screen. <br/><br/>It's all of one piece, cliff hanging heroes saved by the wit and magic of Gandalf or the heart of Bagins. The appearance of Gollum (Andy Serkis) with the ring that changes things forever merits attention as he and Bilbo match wits over riddles. But then again, Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), the visionary elf queen, provides needed visual relief from the ugly trolls and dwarfs. <br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings trilogy deserved to be just that, three installments needed to tell the story. For this Hobbit tale, I expect one go at it would be enough. But not for the voracious Peter Jackson, who has much more New Zealand to traverse before he rests his camera. <br/><br/>The Hobbit is long but fun, not great but entertaining."

","Bilbo Baggins is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarfs led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever  Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's ""precious"" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities . A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.<br/><br/>I wasn't excited to see this as the first set of trailers came out. But after watching The Hobbit, it is in my opinion, equally as brilliant as the first Lord of the Rings film. Originally The Hobbit story was to take place over two films. But Peter Jackson (in George Lucas mode) has decided to turn two into three. So after The Unexpected Journey you'll have The Desolation of Smaug and to conclude, There And Back Again, completing another trilogy.<br/><br/>This news has split fans right done the middle. Nevertheless it's been announced, so what's done is done. I for one I'm excited for the next two offerings. I've been a fan of this universe since the cartoon version of the LOTR's back in the late 70's. Since then the live action films have come and gone and all three have been brilliant on every level, but the Fellowship of The Ring remains my favourite of the film trilogy.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a fantastic film and I loved every minute of it. So much so, I plan to see it again after already seeing it twice. This film like the first set of LOTR's is just an adventurous thrill ride. The Hobbit is filled with small stories and interesting characters and I can see why Jackson has decided to make this into three films. One would never have been enough, two would've satisfied a lot of fans, but announcing three films now has garnered the attention of a lot more people, who originally didn't plan to see this film. Yeah he's in George Lucas mode, but this is his baby, this is his Star Wars and with Guillermo del Toro leaving The Hobbit to focus on Pacific Rim. It's given Jackson full reign to expand the world of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>The film as I said before is fantastic and that's credit to Jackson's eye for consistency and great story telling. Again it's filmed in his beautiful native New Zealand, Jackson's cinematography is so beautiful, you be wondering if Middle Earth actually exists. Performances are all great and it's hard to pick out a real star of the movie. Martin Freeman as the younger Bilbo is excellent in the role. Capturing all the mannerism and quirks Ian Holm displayed as older Bilbo and makes the character his own. Then we have the dwarfs, who light up the screen every time they're on it. Their storytelling and they're mischievous antics really make you forget The Hobbit's three hour running time. James Nesbitt as Bofur, Graham McTavish as Dwalin and Ken Stott as Balin standout from the dwarfs and are just a joy to watch on screen. But it's Richard Armitage as Thorin who really does an amazing job as the leader of the dwarf pack. He's the Aragorn of the pack and shows leadership and strength as his character leads Bilbo and the dwarfs on their journey to the Lonely Mountain.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen is always brilliant and continues where left with Gandalf the Grey as does Andy Serkis, playing the creepy iconic antagonist Gollum. In fact on the two occasions I saw The Hobbit, Gollum's scenes really had the crowd going. To say he stole the film wouldn't be right but his scenes with Bilbo are memorable and wonderfully filmed.<br/><br/>An honourable mention goes to the villainous Azog, the giant white goblin who has a personal vendetta against Thorin. As fun as The Hobbit is, Azog inclusion changes the tone of the film making it darker in some of the scenes, but it's a welcome change, because he is a scary main antagonist and is another reason why fans should look forward to the next set of films.<br/><br/>Of course it was great to see the other familiar faces from the LOTR's universe, but going back to the dwarfs, they really steal the show. Of course this story is about Bilbo's earlier adventures and Freeman does a great job, but I'll looking forward to the next instalment because of dwarfs Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Thorin Oakenshield, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, and Ori.<br/><br/>It would be a shame if this film didn't pick up any awards from a technical standpoint, because it looks amazing, despite the 48 frames per second. Jackson's brilliance comes from the fact he (like the first set of LOTR's films) will film this series of films back to back. As far as I know he is the only director to film three movies back to back. And like his first set of LOTR films, and based on the evidence from this first installment of The Hobbit, December can't come soon enough.<br/><br/>ticket-for-one.com"
"HelenMary","8","4","13","22 December 2012"," unexpectedly (though should not be surprised) brilliant
","As a huge fan of Tolkien, and of course having read The Hobbit, I had no idea how Peter Jackson could split The Hobbit - a much shorter book than Lord of the Rings (LOTR) - into a trilogy, nor how I could sit through such a long film without getting a little bored. That he could do it justice was never in doubt having seen LOTR. However, the time flew by and I was gripped from beginning to end. I was pleased to see Frodo (Elijah Wood) and the older Bilbo (Ian Holm) again before the 'flashback' that introduced Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo and thankfully all the major characters were played by the original actors; Gandalf (who else could play him other than the brilliant Sir Ian McKellan?), Lady Galadriel, Lord Elrond and Saruman etc so there was perfect continuity, albeit that The Hobbit is a prequel.<br/><br/>So, The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey sees Bilbo at home in The Shire at Bag End and Gandalf appears and thinks him suitable for an adventure with a bunch of rowdy, raucous and determined Dwarfs but at first he is reluctant. I was looking forward to the 'chip and glasses and crack the plates' and 'far over the misty mountains' songs and was not at all disappointed with the latter's lovely tune. The adventure takes in Rivendell (home of Elrond, and the last safe haven before the East), trolls, orcs and goblins and various obstacles as the Dwarfs make their way to the Lonely Mountain - their old home - in order to reclaim it from the Dragon Smaug who has taken over their stash of gold. Also during the adventure, Biblo meets Gollum (the incredibly talented Andy Serkis reprising his LOTR genius), the character who possibly steals the show, and it is here of course that Bilbo first comes into contact with the one Ring. The precious.<br/><br/>Of course the locations in New Zealand are wonderfully indicative of Tolkien's writing, the screenplay is gripping, laugh out loud funny and tells the story well and is translated by all the actors flawlessly. I really can't think of anything wrong with it. Of course there is a LOT of CGI involved in the SFX and whilst it is essential with a modern fantasy epic such as this, it is obvious and I get tired of it after a while. A lot of the characters and action are CGI which detracts from the film for me. However, it is very good - I'm not saying it is bad! The scenes with Gollum were hilarious, and whilst there was an inevitable darkness to the film as the story unfolded with the viewer's prescient knowledge of the LOTR already, it's a lighter and funnier adaptation than the original films and has more heart and is more of a morality tale. Peter Jackson has yet again done a stunning job with this incomparable ensemble cast including the likes of Richard Armitage, James Nesbit, Aidan Turner, Sylvester McCoy and Barry Humphries! Critics haven't been entirely complimentary about The Hobbit's first installment but we can remember that LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring received mixed reviews too but both are first parts of epic tales that require a build up and introduction and a setting of the scene but even that said it isn't as if this film is short of action, adventure and excitement. A superb film, and a credit to JRR Tolkien's genius yet again."
"keinen_wyatt","10","4","13","22 December 2012"," Unwittingly misunderstood by critics
","Unwittingly misunderstood by critics as a a book directed towards a slightly younger audience. The hobbit captures the stunning light hearted story telling of this phase of Tolkiens world. Bringing its passionate messages to the big screen.<br/><br/>Courage, Helping your friends and loyalty are just a few of the messages that present themselves and are done justice by the film.<br/><br/>Whats more the characterisation is absolutely stunning. Gollum steals the show but familiar characters like Saruman, lady Galadriel and Lord Elrond gave me the nostalgia i was desiring more so than Bilbo or Frodo. <br/><br/>This film has inspired me to think of more mature tales that should be told to children to make meaningful messages more interesting. I think that Tolkien felt this way, as should other aspiring educators and writers.<br/><br/>The faults of the film are not worth mentioning, as they are written on the parchment of the hobbit its self, and although they may be short comings, they make the narrative that much more enjoyable!<br/><br/>All and all it was an amazing film that a lot of critics clearly just didn't understand. Which is a real shame for them. I can't wait for the next one!"

","OK, I've just seen it twice in the past two days. The Hobbit was the first English book I completely finished reading, and I love LOTR (both the books and the movies), so my expectation for The Hobbit is pretty high.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a totally different book than LoTR, so it follows that the movie feels and pace differently than LoTR. For those who expect it to be the same will be disappointed, bit for you who love the book you will be in for a treat. Yes, there are many addition from other Tolkien's universe books, but they made the movie even more rich.<br/><br/>Yes, it is long, but I didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>Oh, if I haven't said it enough, ignore the critics, go and enjoy this masterpiece of a movie."
"mister-ed-1","7","4","13","21 December 2012"," Some good points - some not so good - good film but prefer the book !
","I read The Hobbit again before going to the film and I can say that I probably prefer the book but i did enjoy seeing how they had made the film. I enjoyed the parts of the film which actually showed the action from the book. Some of the computer graphics in the film were a little ridiculous, particularly in the parts which strayed from the book. <br/><br/>I didn't like the regional accents of the dwarfs. UK regional ! I picked up Scottish, Cockney and Irish, north of England and no doubt others too ! I think they should have had an entirely original ""Middle earthish"" accent - they also seemed to be just a little more unpleasant than the dwarfs in the book ! I would like the dwarfs to have dressed a little more like they do in the book. Although I do seem to think perhaps Tolkien did have some characters who had a London accent...<br/><br/>I also would prefer not to have seen the three head butts that feature in the film - not good for children to see. They may even encourage people to think that is a sensible way to fight which is immensely dangerous. <br/><br/>And finally, there were at least three scenes of computer generated extensive scenery where the sheer extent of the computer graphics were just way beyond what was at all likely - OK great it fills the whole large screen but was at least 33% more than was at all necessary. And we also noticed that very very intermittently we suddenly got a fantastic burst of surround sound - but just in very sporadic bursts...Why not all through the film ? why so sporadic ?<br/><br/>But apart from that I did enjoy the film . I wondered whether it was better to have read the book or not to then watch the film - probably evens either way. In some ways the film did actually enhance the book by explaining the story a little better than I had picked up from the book.<br/><br/>However, yes do go and see it. It might just have a few scenes which are a bit too much for younger viewers e.g. 6 or 8 and under, depending on how squeamish they are. And perhaps it might also not hold their attention - there were a few younger audience members who were a little restless in the first half of the film.<br/><br/>Also, one other thing was the dialogue was not very clever. In the book the dialogue is quite clever - but if you are going to stretch it to three films, you maybe need to get some good screen writers in so that you can write some clever scenes rather than relying on computer animation and graphics which I find over the top.<br/><br/>Also the bits where translations were added to the screen were in some instances farcical.<br/><br/>However enjoy the film !!"

","Hobbits, wizards, dwarfs, elves, trolls, goblins, and dragons adorn this wonderful movie. I have read The Hobbit and all three of the Lord of the Rings books more than once. I am also aware of the complaints that Peter Jackson did not follow the story exactly. So what! He understands the spirit of Tolkien exactly. He has high standards and meets them.<br/><br/>This my first 3D movie. I was impressed! I really don't understand the negative reviews. I was held spellbound from beginning to end. Middle Earth has never looked so beautiful. The special effects are astounding.<br/><br/>Some very effective scenes were the battle against the goblins and the troll fight.<br/><br/>The guy who plays Thorin Oakenshield is great.

"farooqui-omar87","9","4","13","18 December 2012"," Stop comparing to Lord of the Rings!!
","When the Hobbit first came out, I was disappointed with the mixed reviews, mostly negative coming from movies.com and other sources. I read the books as a child so of course I was going to see it regardless, and I must say the movie met my expectations.<br/><br/>It is a big mistake to compare The Hobbit with LOTR! Many critics are doing this; I assume the people who haven't read the book as a child. LOTR is a very very dark storyline, in which if their quest fails, they are all doomed resulting in Sauron controlling Middle Earth. The Hobbit is more of an adventurous tale in which if the group were to turn back, nothing would have changed. You can argue that part of the tale is dark, but nothing as close to the Lord of the Rings. Also, not sure why people are stating that The Hobbit is the prelude to the LOTR... THIS IS NOT THE CASE.<br/><br/>Many people thought the movie was rather boring and slow, but since this is the first movie, this had to be expected as Peter Jackson dragged this 300 pg book into a trilogy. People had similar thoughts for the Fellowship of the Ring, and look how much action was in the 2nd / 3rd movies (Battle of Helms Deep / Battle of the Pelennor Fields). I think this was an amazing setup (possibly better than the Fellowship) for the rest of the movies. And from reading the books, I can assure you that the next two movies will have a great deal of action.<br/><br/>I think people who are disappointed in the movie are the ones who are comparing it to the intensity of the LOTR and thus, living to an unrealistic hype, having expected the movie would surpass the Lord of the Rings, which is a daunting task.<br/><br/>The only drawback from the book (which I guess in the movie as well) is that I wish JRR Tolkein provided more character development on the dwarfs. I had some trouble remembering each one by face."
"Bottlebrush","10","4","13","17 December 2012"," Absolutely breathtaking.
","I had already posted my thoughts on this film after seeing it in 2D, but thought I would now do so after seeing it in 3D 48 HFR last night.<br/><br/>CASTING The LOTR films are my favourites of all time, but I have always thought there were weak points in the casting, notably of the Hobbits. Whether it is because PJ didn't have the choice, or the knowledge, to get the right actors for LOTR ten years ago, I don't know. In any case, the casting for the Hobbit is brilliant. Martin Freeman is superb as Bilbo, as is Richard Armitage in the role of Thorin Oakenshield. Sir Ian McKellen is wonderful, as can be expected. These actors simply have the range to produce the right sort of work for the film, and to do the characters justice. The other characters were all pretty well cast (though of necessity their personalities could not be shown much, which is the case in the book as well). After Thorin, my favourite among the Dwarfs is Balin, played by Ken Stott, another fine actor (I didn't actually realize it was him until after I saw the film). Thandruil looks extremely impressive, and Elrond and Galadriel were the usual pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>MUSIC This connected effortlessly with the LOTR films. The song Thorin sang at Bilbo's house is beautiful. All of the music was perfectly in tune with the scenery and action.<br/><br/>PLOT This was much smoother than that in the LOTR films, where the action jumped about from place to place (due to the story, I know, but it was a bit distracting).<br/><br/>VISUALS These were simply stunning (and all the better for 3D 48 HFR in my view).<br/><br/>FRAME RATES While I very much enjoyed the film in 2D, the 3D 48 HFR format made the film extraordinary. Particularly magnificent were scenes like Erebor, Rivendale (the waterfall in moonlight, for example), the eagles with the scenery around them, Smaug's lair with the tinkling gold, Riddles in the Dark, and the breathtaking views of the mountains as the company made its way through them. The Goblin city improved immensely with this format. The scenes in Bilbo's house were so sharp – you could see every detail of beards, hair, costumes and artefacts. It truly felt as though you could immerse yourself in the experience.<br/><br/>I really don't get the criticism levied at the higher rate format at all. There was no blurred vision, no headaches, and I didn't have to get used to the format for an hour or so. I don't know: perhaps people who complain about these things need to have their eyes tested? The only time that things got a little bit blurred was in the close-up shots of Dwarfs battling with Goblins. This is, however, new technology, and I am sure such things will eventually be ironed out. (Perhaps these particular incidents need to be shown in a yet higher frame rate, or maybe the actors are moving too quickly? When wielding heavy swords surely the action must be quite slow?) <br/><br/>All in all, the film is an absolute delight, and I fully intend to see it again. These were also the thoughts of the people who were with me. The film in fact made such an impression on me that I dreamed about it last night (unusual for me).<br/><br/>Since I rate films according to the pleasure they give me, rather than focusing on nitpicking details, this is a 10/10 for me."
"KDizz2011","10","4","13","16 December 2012"," Masterful Vision
","This review may contain spoilers, and is my first review. Viewing this as a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan, I knew that Peter Jackson would put his whole heart into the Hobbit, if only for the sake of the viewer. Though I had my worries, a vast majority of them were put to rest after the first 30 minutes, sending me into another journey through Middle Earth I had longed for since LotR. In terms of content, this is NOT the Hobbit that everyone read in their childhood; what Peter Jackson does by drawing from the appendices enriches the story and pays off to the fullest, giving the film a twinge of gratuitous unpredictability. The cast is incredible: the veterans of Middle Earth do a stellar job reprising their roles and finding chemistry on screen with their new counterparts. Ian McKellen somehow manages to seem younger rather than aged ten years, and maintains his impressive presence on screen. Andy Serkis proves once again that he is a true frontiersman in the field of motion capture. The dwarfs are all very impressive and fitting for their roles, and Martin Freeman accomplishes the challenge of getting fans on board with him as a young Bilbo Baggins. The visuals are INCREDIBLE. WETA Digital makes the imaginary tangible, and at 48fps I felt like I wasn't watching a movie... I felt like I was experiencing it. The 3D also is very well done for a live-action film, possibly one of the best I've seen to date. If I had one critique, it would be the music; Howard Shore's score seems like it doesn't match up to what's going on on screen at times. Or, it doesn't play to full effect or have as many memorable instances like LotR. BUT, negatives aside, the music is still entrancing and epic at times, mainly the theme melody of the Misty Mountain song. Peter Jackson is a visionary, and I would trust him with any project. He shows his love for film and generates amazing bonds and amazing work from his cast and his crew, as is evident throughout the entire film. I can't wait to continue the adventure next year."
"leegy_95","10","4","13","16 December 2012"," Peter Jackson did it again!!!
","I watched The Hobbit at a premiere screening here in Malaysia. Although I did not get to watch it in the HFR(48fps) version, but I manage to watch it in IMAX 3D. <br/><br/>Now, this is a movie where people from all around the world had been waiting for a very long time. Many were mad when Peter Jackson is not directing it. But luckily, he step in to direct it when Guillermo del Toro step down.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson is no doubt one of the best filmmaker of all time. I'm really a big fan of him and I'm proud to say that I've watched almost all of his movies like The Lovely Bones, King Kong, LOTR Trilogy, and even films he made during the early days like Bad Taste and Dead Alive. His LOTR Trilogy was THE BEST Trilogy I've ever seen! <br/><br/>In The Hobbit, Peter really did an amazing job! The 3D effects were stunning and the sound was just amazing! You really have to experience it yourself to know what I'm saying here! The Hobbit is also as epic as always! The fight scenes were fast and epic! The acting was superb! Gollum looks so real! And who would not mention the scenery when it comes to Peter Jackson's films??? The New Zealand scenery is just out of this world! Just like the LOTR, Peter filmed The Hobbit in New Zealand where the scenery is just breathtaking. The scenery would just make you want to pay NZ a visit! There was also flash back stories for those who have not read the book to make you understand the movie better! I could go on and on but there's just too much to be listed here. You have to go see it for yourself! <br/><br/>But, there is one minor problem... It was too long.<br/><br/>The Hobbit was 2 hrs 49 mins long. That is a long movie. There were some scenes which I Think is not really necessary. So make sure you were ready before sitting down in the cinema for 2 hours watching it! <br/><br/>The conclusion is The Hobbit is a MUST WATCH for LOTR fans as well as Peter Jackson fans (like me). You will be drawn to its beautiful scenery as well as its epic battle scenes. <br/><br/>After watching the first part of The Hobbit trilogy, I was so glad middle-earth was back and know that there's more to come. I have no doubt at all that this trilogy will be the next epic trilogy after LOTR."

","This movie is great. I'm not a huge LOTR fan or Hobbit fan by any means, but I have read all of the books once before. With that being said, it's been years since I've read The Hobbit, so much of the story is stored away in the depths of my memory...<br/><br/>I have to say that I enjoyed this movie more so than any LOTR movie. Why? For the same reasons most top critics disliked the movie, the plot detail. From what I can remember about the plot in the book, the movie stays very true and doesn't sway too much. There's also a lot of backstory about Thorin that I didn't remember and it was nice to see that thrown in. The one thing that I've read in other reviews where I disagree is all the talk about how slow this movie starts. Well, if you remember the book, that starts slow too. BUT, I didn't find the start of the movie (gathering of the group of adventurers/dinner/etc..) to drag on at all! I found it very enjoyable and the movie flowed excellently all the way through.<br/><br/>Highly enjoyed this movie, it's very thorough plot, and the flow of the movie is superb to where it never gets boring. I would have gladly sat through another 3 hours of ""part 2"". Wish it was out already."

","After reading some of the reviews posted by professional critics, my expectations about the standards of this movie were somewhat lowered. Nonetheless, I thought of giving it a shot because I am a big fan of the LOTR series.<br/><br/>To put my experience in a nutshell, it was nothing short of 'AWESOME!' To name a few aspects that caught my senses, the landscapes were magical, the fighting scenes were intense, acting was brilliant and the music, as always, was of the finest caliber.<br/><br/>When comparing the Hobbit with the LOTR trilogy, I do feel that this movie may have been slightly below the extreme standards that were preset. However, I believe the contrast in the character of the two books is the reason behind this phenomenon. However, this was in NO WAY a disappointment.<br/><br/>My recommendation is, read as few reviews as possible and go to the theater with an open mind!<br/><br/>Treat yourself to a three hour journey of fantastic movie making!"
"krkhan","8","4","13","16 December 2012"," Decade of anticipation rewarded perfectly
","I have to admit, when I went to the theater I was jittery about what Peter Jackson might do to one of the most cherished parts of my childhood -- and life. Movies, stories and epic fantasy obsessions came and passed by. When the first Rings movies came out I was a fan of a certain teen wizard with a scar on his forehead. Twelve years later, after going through works of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Coppola and Welles; I look back and cringe at why I even saw the first three movies of the Harry Potter series. But the only fanboy hat that consistently remained perched on my head throughout this period was Middle Earth and Tolkien.<br/><br/>Owing to the unprecedented success, there are many kinds of people who watched LOTR movies. There were those who didn't find hairy-feet teens fighting an evil fireball to be their cup of tea, e.g., Ebert. While I have great respect for Roger -- and find myself aligning his reviews many times -- he falls in this category. Fortunately, I do enjoy movies about wizards flying on giant eagles.<br/><br/>There are those who love the books and despise Jackson for botching up their visions of Middle-Earth. I read another guy's review here who said that Twilight movie makers were more faithful to their source material than Jackson. That's understandable. These people had a different view of how Middle-Earth should have been on screen, let's wait for a few more decades and hope someone adapts it again.<br/><br/>Then there are those who were absolutely immersed in the movies. Sure the movies are different from source material. Going back to the Twilight complaint, compared to Tolkien's works it was written last Friday. Being modern, it already was suitable for screenplay in a manner Tolkien's works would never be. I loved reading about Bombadil, but that just doesn't work on a screen. We watched the original movies many many times, extended versions many more, and felt more than delighted to give Jackson the license to entertain us with his interpretation of Middle-Earth on screen. We wished and prayed for another chance to live in that world, we cringed when Del Toro was on the horizon and Jackson was nowhere nearby. We celebrated when Jackson returned with everyone else on board. Being one of these people, I put on my 3D glasses and became concerned as soon as I saw a supposedly younger Gandalf showing the heart-breaking mellowing of Ian McKellen in his face.<br/><br/>Luckily, I have never been happier to be proved wrong. They did it again! For the next two and a half hours I found myself fading away in Jackson's grand vision of Middle-Earth just as I did 12 years ago. Sure, some characters were there who weren't present in the book. Some had their stories modified, but for me, that *worked*. By the time the movie ended I had the *exact* same feeling of anticipation I felt at the end of Fellowship. I wanted it to go on. I wanted to stay in Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not just a movie based on The Hobbit. It's an adaptation of various events that happened at a certain time period in Tolkien's legendarium. It has Silmarillion, it has Unfinished Tales. But more importantly, it has *Peter Jackson*. It makes you feel nostalgic without losing the novelty. It makes you marvel at the achievement of technology, it makes you gape in wonder at Middle-Earth. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is still the greatest wizard to ever be filmed. Martin Freeman is leaps and bounds ahead of Elijah Wood as the main hobbit (no disrespect to Woods, Freeman's talent is just on another level). Richard Armitage commands authority as Thorin Oakenshielf. Last but not the least, Peter Jackson makes you feel grateful for the chance to be there and back again.<br/><br/>I have no idea how a neutral would find this movie. Perhaps long, tedious, or even fun. I just am glad that I am not a neutral in this case."
"Sage-c4","6","4","13","15 December 2012"," I sat stupefied with incredulous boredom
","This film entertains while failing to enthrall as did its older brother, LOTR. I sat with a frown on my face for most of the running time, relieved by two or three chuckles.<br/><br/>It has been suggested that Tolkien's appeal lies not his story-telling, but in his ability to transport the reader to that alternate reality, Middle Earth. Jackson's LOTR films succeeded, despite various compromises, in that same effect. This film does not.<br/><br/>What went wrong? <br/><br/>Too much effort to integrate with established LOTR orthodoxy, I suspect. I was transported, not to Middle Earth, but to the sound stages of the previous films. I looked, not at characters, but at actors playing them. Freeman, Nesbit, and Armitage turn in real performances, but most of the actors reprising roles were wooden. Maybe because they so defined the characters in the earlier films, Jackson has been satisfied with takes wherein they simply get their lines right. Only Lee and Blachett add any dimension to their LOTR characters; the rest fall short.<br/><br/>It starts right away. Holm looks and sounds slightly embalmed as old Bilbo. Is it CGI makeup? Something not right in the eyebrows; lack of facial expression, intonation husky and flat with the intervening years. McKellen likewise turns in a diminished performance, his expressive range is nearly as narrow as Holm's.<br/><br/>Is Holm wearing contacts to match Freeman's eye color? If so, it's a mistake. We could instead infer that his eyes have been drained of color by the Ring - compare Gollum's watery orbs. Wood is no longer boyish, despite makeup, his voice more mature. Too bad he couldn't be digitally lifted from Huckleberry Finn or Oliver Twist. <br/><br/>Too much telling instead of showing. Can't show us Sackville-Bagginses stealing the silver? Then leave it out. Holm narrates a dwarve backstory so parallel to the ""forging of the rings"" flashback in Fellowship it's almost a parody, with Thorin a three-quarter-scale Isildur.<br/><br/>Does Jackson think audiences will watch only one of the trilogies? If some element is present in one, why duplicate it in the other? Chandeliers and moths - really?<br/><br/>Azog (does the name mean ""little Sauron rip-off""?) is a recurring mistake throughout. Many of the iconic scenes from the novel are spoiled by this CGI construct, a sort of recombinant (WO)Khan/Ahab/Moby-Dick chimera. Why does this character exist? The Company does not need pursuit or a lurking enemy: it's is GOING to the Lonely Mountain, and will encounter plenty of obstacles to keep up the suspense.<br/><br/>Roast Mutton is hurried and under-acted as a result. The entrance to Rivendell recreates the Race to the Ford with Azog in the place of the pursuing Wraiths. I like the inclusion of Radagast, but here is another timewaster, with the brown wizard distracting the pursuing orcs, with every tedious element of a video game cut scene. The main characters stand idly by, waiting with the audience for it to end, so play can resume. Fortunately, the DVD release will allow us to skip the scene. <br/><br/>Then Rivendell, like Hobbitton, somehow larger and more elaborate, but curiously empty of inhabitants and stage business. Weaving, despite rumors that the elves would be jollier, looking more glum and fretful even than in LOTR, when there should be a knowing twinkle in his eye. La-la-la-lally, indeed... <br/><br/>Happiest moment was the Storm Giant battle, which might have wound up on the cutting room floor along with Tom Bombadil for all the difference it makes to the plot. Still, it's marred by referencing the collapsing stairs of Moria. And not enough lightning.<br/><br/>The goblins should still be isolated in the Misty Mountains, jealous of their borders, not yet under thrall to Sauron. Instead, they seem to have direct communication with other baddies. Humphries' Great Goblin sounds about halfway between Bruce and Dame Edna, a little too sarcastic, and not quite suspiciously enraged. The Great Goblin diminishes his own terrifying status by threatening to...turn them over to Azog. You've got to be joking!<br/><br/>With so much material added from outside the text of the Hobbit novel proper, how can the result be so unoriginal? In the novel, we get the sense of Bilbo slogging along, not really comprehending the magnitude of the journey. But the reader gets a sense of a vast, unknown world around him. Not in this film. Like Lucas before him, Jackson has created a prequel which diminishes the scope of the original, rather than augmenting it. Middle Earth grows smaller with each recreated set.<br/><br/>That this film, with its enormous budget and gifted pool of talent and technology, fails to supersede the humble Rankin-Bass animated production, is the most damning comment I can make. I liked, not loved, it."

","Concerning Hobbits, <br/><br/>Open the doors to a Hobbit hole and you will not find a dirty, nasty hole, but rather a warm, inviting place full of food and merriment...and perhaps a bit of adventure?<br/><br/>Such is the world of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit. Peter Jackson, yet again, brings to life Tolkien's universe and breathes into it his own artistic ability and directing skills. We are once again graced by amazing camera work, superb acting, and wonderful suspense.<br/><br/>We start the story off with and older Bilbo (Ian Holm) beginning to write his tale as seen in LotR: The Fellowship of the Ring, and right alongside him is his nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood). Bilbo beings to think about his adventures and, rightly, is where ours begins as well. <br/><br/>The movies never lose a step from The Lord of the Rings, and continue the creative spark that generated such a fan base in the first place. Ian McKellan seamlessly steps back into his role as Gandalf, bringing back his mystique and allure to the character. The return of Elrond, Galadriel, among others, sends the series back to its roots.<br/><br/>However in light of all of this, some people will not be satisfied by the liberties taken by Jackson with the additions to the story, such as with the meeting of the White Council and the Necromancer, but this author has to say I am more than satisfied with this. These are movies, not books, and as such you need to keep the watcher engaged. Also Peter Jackson is attempting to unite The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings into one....One Director to bring them both together, and in the cinema...bind them. <br/><br/>The Hobbit is only one part of a great movie, so I cannot give it a 10/10, but with this great leap to a new series, Peter Jackson has my full confidence yet again."
"drpepper141","9","4","13","14 December 2012"," Ignore the critics, this the Hobbit Trilogy is off to a better start than the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Review<br/><br/>I was looking forward to ""An Unexpected Journey"" since the first trailer was released at the end of 2011. I had high expectations for this movie, but once the first reviews from critics came in I thought I had to lower my expectations. This wasn't needed: ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" completely surpassed all my expectations.<br/><br/>One of the things I loved most about this movie was how similar it was to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. This is the same Middle-earth we all know and love from the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. The scenery is the same in locations such as Rivendell and the Shire, and this was a good thing, for me anyway. Actors and actresses from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy reprise their roles for ""An Unexpected Journey"" and they don't disappoint. Some of the music by Howard Shore from the ""Lord of the Rings"" reappears here and this is very welcome.<br/><br/>Now that we have discussed the similarities, let's get on to the rest of the movie. I want to start with the acting. You may have heard that Martin Freeman is an extraordinary Bilbo Baggins, and this is true. From the moment Freeman spoke his first line as Bilbo, I knew it. He plays his character with such charisma it is hard to denounce his performance. Ian McKellen is as sharp as ever, reprising his role as Gandalf the Grey. Richard Armitage plays a great Thorin, and he really captures the bitterness, desperation, and coldness of the character. The rest of the dwarfs are likable but you can't really connect deeply with all of them. Most of the critics didn't like this but I didn't mind it. I don't believe it was ever the intention of Tolkien to establish a deep connection with all of the dwarfs. Andy Serkis steals the show as Gollum, the obsessed degenerate creature. Gollum looks incredibly and I got shivers by just how fiercely he delivered his lines. The actors and actresses all did fantastic jobs in this film.<br/><br/>The CGI looks absolutely incredible and very realistic. Some of the scenes my jaw dropped by just how epic the movie got and how astounding the effects were. ""An Unexpected Journey"" features tons of CGI, which a lot of critics seemed to dislike. I didn't mind it, in fact I liked it because it looked so good!<br/><br/>The soundtrack of ""An Unexpected Journey"" by Howard Shore is marvellous and has the same feel as the ""Lord of the Rings."" This is a great thing. The soundtrack to the ""Lord of the Rings"" was perfect and it is in ""An Unexpected Journey"" to.<br/><br/>Now that we have talked about what makes the movie so great, I want to talk a little about what is actually in the movie. The premise is simple: Bilbo Baggins is recruited by Gandalf the Grey into the Company of Thorin Oakenshield as the Burglar. They journey a long distance and most of the way they fight great battles with giant monsters. The action was very well done.<br/><br/>I watched this in 24 frames per second in 3D. The 3D was absolutely incredible is some scenes. In one of the scenes I even tried to get out of the way of a boulder, that is how immersing it is!<br/><br/>Lastly, and probably the least important, but ""An Unexpected Journey"" is actually really funny! There were a lot of good moments where I could not help but laugh.<br/><br/>So the movie may sound perfect so far. My only real complain was that some of the scenes dragged on a bit to long. However, again, I did not mind this because even when I felt the scene was getting long it was still well done.<br/><br/>There were many movies that came out this year. When I came into ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" I knew my favourite movie of 2012 would be between ""the Hobbit,"" ""the Avengers"" and ""the Dark Knight Rises."" I am very pleased to say ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was my favourite movie of the year by far. This movies only flaw is some scenes drag on two or three minutes to long. This is not a big enough issue to give ""An Unexpected Journey"" anything other than a 10 out of 10. Go watch this movie right now, it deserves your money and I am looking forward very much to the next Hobbit."

","From the great list of directors the world has seen, none are more deserving to be called the king of fantasy than Peter Jackson. His ability to adapt material & transport an audience is incredible. He now gives us an evocative & welcome return to Middle Earth with a lighter story but with some of the same & plenty of new characters. The world of film was never quite the same since Lord of the Rings wrapped up. The stakes here are not as high as the previous trilogy, but the level of epicness is apparent & the story promises to get darker over the next two installments.<br/><br/>The movie as plenty of great cinematic moments; the prologue and final escape/battle but what stands out (my favorite chapter in the book) is Riddles in the Dark with Gollum and Bilbo; it is pure cinematic magic. Jackson creates drama & intrigue from an outcome many of the viewers are familiar with. It was the movie's best part & it proves that Freeman was the perfect casting choice for Bilbo.<br/><br/>The newer aspects of the adventure story; dwarven culture, goblins/orcs with a slight narrative arc, and a new wizard makes the film feel richer. Richard Armitage gives a commanding performance as Thorin & will likely be one of the new trilogy's most endearing characters. We're one movie in and you can already tell his character has been fleshed out nicely. His 'far over the misty mountains' song with the dwarfs was chilling. It may be Bilbo's story, but the changes Thorin undergoes during the 3 films will be just as significant. Jackson made a bold decision to include all of the books 13 dwarfs and gives them distinct personalities and design (something the book clearly failed to do). Though not accomplished yet, by the end of the trilogy I am sure most will be easily identified; that's saying something for a large group of secondary characters. The goblins are given character; an underground monarchy as well as a intimidating chief antagonist with a bone to pick with the dwarf leader. I also loved the new nature-centric wizard, Radagast, and look forward to how his story plays out. All these elements greatly enhance Tolkein's version of the book in my opinion and makes the narrative more interesting.<br/><br/>Jackson's trademark epic sweeping shots & battle sequences are evident again and add to the film's grandeur. Howard Shore's musical genius also marks a return mixing some familiar notes with new themes.<br/><br/>Overall, Jackson was born to bring Tolkeins work on the big screen (and his own little additions and subtractions here & there). He captures the book's lighter tone (even the songs!) while setting up a greater & darker epic for the later installments. So sit back, relax, & enjoy the adventure."
"akram_27","10","4","13","14 December 2012"," An excellent movie for Tolkien lovers, and new comers as well
","The movie follows the content closely while adding some well placed additions to create the movie. I highly recommend people to watch this movie. The dwarfs were always gonna be a challenge to put on the big screen, while they almost all had their moments, they weren't defining enough. The mixture between make-up and CGI was bearable. <br/><br/>The movie was hugely satisfying and i will definitely see it again and again, the world we are being enticed into is so rich that one could lose themselves in it. Don't mind the critics, the story flows well and there's not a dull moment !!<br/><br/>P.S well done to the cast and especially Andy Serkis"
"ChuckB1965","9","4","13","14 December 2012"," 99% there
","I went to the midnight opening for this movie. And,the theater was only filled to about 80% capacity. I think is a slight protest for having the film company choose to make this 1 book into 3 movies. Is someone money hungry over this? Yes (my opinion). Do I agree with the protest? Yes again. But, with that put aside. One thing is abundantly clear. Peter Jackson and his team at WETA can make a damn good movie. When I left the theater at the end of the movie. I felt that there was either something missing, or something different from the ""Fellowship"" movies. And, the answer dawned on me. It's Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins. It's not that it's bad. His performance is actually quite good. The fact of the matter is, that even though there is evil lurking and there are bad creatures all around. This film has a lighthearted quality about it. And, that's because Bilbo Baggins was a lighthearted Hobbit until adventure arrived at his door at Bag End. Although the movie is long at 2 hours & 45 minutes. Every scene is filled with storyline & detail. Once again Peter Jackson & WETA can make a damn good movie! Go see it. You won't be disappointed."

","I love the Hobbit. Great Book. The film was good but...<br/><br/>The climax of this film comes when Bilbo murders a Goblin and saves Thorin.<br/><br/>Isn't the whole point of the book that Bilbo was non-violent. Isn't sitting out of the battle of five armies the most courageous thing he does in the book? And in this version her murders a Goblin to impress his peers? I think the point of the book is being muddled by the film makers.<br/><br/>The Great Goblin sucked too.<br/><br/>I was engrossed, just worried about the character of Bilbo. He's not an action star. Just a brave man in way over his head."

","This movie was fantastic. I was not disappointment at all. Absolutely LOVED the entire experience! All those so called professional movie reviewers are crazy giving this movie a bad review. They must have watched a different movie.<br/><br/>One thing I loved seeing is more song and food. Feasting and singing was a big part of Tolkien's writings and was glad to see they added more of that in the Hobbit.<br/><br/>It was also a nice surprise to see that they brought in a character from the silmarillion. <br/><br/>I was not put off by the 48 fps at all. I rather enjoyed the higher definition, especially for all those amazing epic panoramas.<br/><br/>I also loved the imaging of the Dwarf minds. Very, very well done!"
"tkoncilija","10","4","13","14 December 2012"," Not a hit, but definitely epic
","If Jackson and the guys wanted to make a hit out of the Hobbit, they should had considered making only one movie instead of a trilogy. This stretching of the material would probably drive away many viewers - even if the special effects are better than ever. But what I liked in this ""Unespected Journey"" (long expected for me, at least) was it's attention to detail. Not just the story, the characters and the landscape - also the things that are rarely visible in a fictional film. What caught my attention was - the music.<br/><br/>Not just the basic soundtrack, but the actual performing within the story. Especially the dwarf songs (the first, happy one, and the second - Over the misty mountain cold - since I've always been a big fan of Richard Armitage - BTW, I was thrilled when it was announced he'd take the role of Thorin). I guess all the singing might seem boring to an average viewer (who is used of Transformers and such action films), but to me it was a medium who brought the epic dimension in this movie. And as a contrast - the elves with their sophisticated and peaceful instruments. I hope there will be a lot more of that in the sequels. <br/><br/>The only thing bothering me were the references on the LotR. I mean, we've all seen the movies, probably just recently (because of the big expectations for the Hobbit) and it's really annoying to watch the same characters - especially Saruman and Galadriel - saying these long and boring lines (which are in no way important to this particular story). I mean, in this time they could show a bit more of dwarfs and their conversations and jokes. After all, it's based on a children's' story.<br/><br/>But for the most part, An Unexpected Journey is an introduction to (what's hopefully to be) an epic journey to the Middle Earth, and the details and the serenity of the storytelling have the potential to become an incredible fairytale for all generations."

","Technical Execution Words really don't do this film justice when seen in high resolution IMAX format in 3D. The high frame rate, from my perspective, was an incredibly positive aspect to the film. I felt as if I was really there, experiencing everything the characters were feeling. I found myself instinctively dodging rocks, feeling a genuine sense of terror at the Hobbit's few scary moments. I can understand that it might not be for everyone, and that's fine. I'm sure it will rock any screen it graces. That's my nutshell impression of the film's technical side.<br/><br/>Acting/Storyline/Plot The acting of most recent films has been disappointing, to say the least. This a refreshing return to films that thrill and really make you feel ""at home"" with the characters. Peter Jackson has created a fantastical world of danger and fantasy where the actors are free to act out their characters-- they are some lucky folks! I felt a keen sense of connection with the Dwarfs' plight, the desire to return and take back their home. Many people are saying the ""intro"" was too long. What intro? Huh? The whole ""beginning"" section of the movie is necessary to create that emotional connection that really gives the film a weighty feel. I left the theater feeling alive and happy.<br/><br/>Other thoughts. I walked into the theater with very high expectations-- and a bit skeptical that the film would deliver. It surpassed everything I had hoped for and more. Don't listen to the critics this time. Don't waste your time on the reviews. Just go see it!"
"Xillx","4","5","18","18 December 2012"," Horrible soundtrack ruins movie
","Well this is a deception: Not even 10 minutes in and you have already been bombarded with all the musical themes of Lord of the Ring - unchanged, not re-harmonized and not re-orchestrated either. From that point on I thought to myself ""can they really be that cheap?"". Are they in it only for the money? This is a different movie after all, shouldn't it deserve it's own soundtrack considering we're going to be feed 9 hours of that stuff...<br/><br/>More comments about the music: The soundtrack here is lame, even by the low standards of the movie industry. How about a chord inversion from time to time? The only new theme here is just bad and lacks originality. The rest is taken from Lord of the Ring, it's not even modulated (a tone below would have been appropriate for a prelude, along with an inversion of the harmonic polarities or a modulation to the relative modes) nor transformed slightly. The orchestration is just as rudimentary, a if out of a 75 musicians orchestra the composer, with all his energy, is only able to achieve a total of 4 or 5 colours.<br/><br/>We get it, a minor third and a fourth, 4 horns in unison, V-VII-I in minor; it's all it takes to get out the cash out of the musically-uncultured customer. Where is the sophistication? Why is there no ""Hobbit themes""?<br/><br/>General comments: So yeah, the music ruined it for me, if you wish to get a review about the ""amazing script"" (some even dare call this a masterpiece) please read the following or preceding reviews.<br/><br/>Frankly, it's still Jackson's fault, it's the usual mistake ""good"" directors will make - to take the popular named music composer, where the really great directors like Paul Thomas Anderson will have a real control over the final result (or perhaps the term is critical judgment).<br/><br/>For me it's nothing more than what you can expect from the trailers. Too much CGI, scenes that are twice too long, but a nice cinematography - the later which justify a 6.<br/><br/>Overall: This movie cannot stand on it's own and relies way too much on the Lord of the Ring success."

","Even though the movie is not totally based on the book, the lord of the ring's fans won't be disappointed. The special effects and the music are magical and the performance of the actors great. The first movie of the hobbit is very rewarding, which was quite expected from P.Jackson, who is a master on making a book alive, without so much as damaging its original atmosphere. Of course the movie leaves you with a sense of incomplete, forcing you to wait for an other year for the next movie. But it is forth it. Smart and funny lines with the familiar topic of epic adventure drives the viewer into the fairytale, making you to want for more. Loved the scene with the riddles, the tragical character of gollum once more stolling the spotlight from Bilbo (but only for that scene)."
"thetruth45","3","3","9","20 January 2013"," Terrible
","This movie was lousy. How in the world do people think this is worthy of an 8.3? First of all, who shot this movie? This movie looks like it was shot with a hand-held video camera that was bought used at a local pawnshop. Seriously, it looks like crap. I saw it in 3D and during the pre-movie previews I was commenting to the girl I was sitting next to at what amazing strides 3D had made... seriously every movie that is coming out with 3D looks AWESOME. So the actual movie starts and it literally looks like a home-made movie. All I could think about is the awesome pre-movie previews of OTHER movies. I was thinking- why didn't a movie with this kinda budget use THAT CAMERA instead of the hand-held pawnshop camera that they obviously decided to use? In this instant movie (the Hobbit) You could see the makeup on the actor's faces. You could see the skin skull caps worn for the balding characters (i.e. the face makeup used to make non-bald characters look bald). It was atrocious... the worst special effects and photography and make up and whatever goes into making a movie ""look real."" It looked HORRENDOUS (which would be a compliment).<br/><br/>Second, the Acting was bad. Again it reminded me of some sort of perverse home-movie project. The word ""Amateur"" doesn't even accurately describe what I saw from the cast. A couple of decent actors were there, like the Dwarven leader of the pack, and Gandolf was okay. But beyond that, these actors were abysmal. Where on earth did they find these guys? Third, the Story. Well there really isn't a story. They are on a journey from point A to point B. Mind you that this is a one-book story....yet the insane director/writer decided to turn a non-event into a 3-movie disaster. This movie is like 3 hours long and nothing happens. Seriously. They go on a camping trip and get attacked a couple times....that's the movie. 3 hours to watch a bunch of bad actors go on a camping trip. AWFUL.<br/><br/>The list of atrocities would go on ad nauseum but it's not worth my effort or time to sit here and tell you about em. It sucked, bottom line- nothing else to say."
"Mackiatoe","5","3","9","19 January 2013"," Bitterly Disappointed
","As a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the works of Tolkein, I had high expectations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. However, I was not prepared for what I saw.<br/><br/>I know Peter Jackson changed some things in the original 3 Lord of the Rings films compared with the book, but this makes it seem as if the book didn't exist (The Hobbit, that is). To put it briefly, this film ruins the original plot, adds entire new scenes NEVER even mentioned in the book, introduces characters at the wrong time, looks unrealistic at times, has annoying scenes, unlikeable characters and is at many point rather cheesy. I cannot believe what Jackson has done.<br/><br/>Sure, it's amusing at times, and has the usual stunning scenes of Middle Earth (aka New Zealand). Plus, for die-hard fans, we saw a lot more of Rivendell than in the LotR trilogy, and most of the acting was brilliant, certainly on level with LotR. However, that is sadly where it ends.<br/><br/>I recently read The Hobbit, as I was encouraged by some of my friends to do so before seeing the film. I'm glad I did, as the events in this are completely mixed up. Granted, some scenes were just like the events in the book, but new scenes that were never mentioned in the book are added; in many places the order is changed, and at one point in Rivendell, an entire new scene is added, with none other than Galadriel and Saruman in it! This scene was really annoying for me in fact, as it turned the film into a full blown prequel to Lord of the Rings. Keep in mind, when Tolkein first wrote the book, he never had much intention of writing a sequel, and so never added anything that would set up the next story. This does, and it really, really annoys me. It felt unnecessary and pointless - their is no mention of 'dakrness stirring' in the book. What I must just say now (before I annoy too many people) is that a lot of the extra content was made up from the appendices of The Lord of the Rings book. While much of it developed The Hobbit, it turns the whole story into something else...<br/><br/>The only thing I genuinely liked were a few of the characters. Ian McKellen did his usual and very good job of playing Gandalf - you really can't go wrong with him. Martin Freeman (even though he was blunt at times) played Bilbo very well, and his style of acting suits the Bilbo in the book (if you get what I mean) very well. Hugo Weaving played Elrond very well once again, and is probably portrayed the most accurately from the book (he doesn't say much in the book, and doesn't play a major role in the film either). The Dwarfs all felt plausible when compared to the book, however Thorin annoyed me. He was by far the most unlikeable character in the film - he's made to look as if he has 'been though so much', 'lost everything', 'oh no! we must all have sympathy for him'. Do you know what? It get so boring after a while. His expressions felt fake, he showed little emotion and despite being the leader of the Dwarfs, he shows just about no change. Then there is the matter of the large number of characters added in, which I simply need not go into.<br/><br/>What really disappointed me was that I never felt anything in the film. In LotR, I felt my heart beat go up and got goosebumps in many scenes. In this I felt none. There's just nothing to it. Sure, comparing anything to the amzingness of LotR is a bit unfair, but this is in the same line as it - and it never moved me. Never. This really ruined the experience of the film.<br/><br/>Well, I think I'll conclude my review now. In short, this film takes the book and turns it into a typical, Hollywood-ised flick with annoying characters and a story that does not match the book. And after watching it, I felt ripped off. This is Peter Jackson directing it, not Micahel Bay. But it certainly did not feel like a Peter Jackson film. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, then yes, you should see it, just for the hell of it. But don't expect anything from it. I would be happy if it was on a similar level to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it wasn't. And I really, really wanted to love this film. What worries me is that Jackson is filming all 3 films back to back. If they're all like this, then I will not know what to say. Peter Jackson, you have disappointed me and ruined a classic book.<br/><br/>5/10"
"jellysquad11","Null","3","9","12 January 2013"," ""I'm Surrounded by Dwarfs!!!""
","The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey is Peter Jackson's answer to J.R.R Tolkien ""The Hobbit"". ""The Hobbit"" was written before the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and has already been adapted into many cartoons and animation features. The Hobbit is, visually, an extremely rewarding experience; I can say that the opinions of the 48fps (frames per second) are not completely true. You can tell a difference between this and regular fps speeds in the beginning, but it is a minor distraction and remains so for only a little while. The screen ensemble gave a good performance, not great, but good while Andy Serkis gave an absolutely stunning motion capture performance for Gollum. His 5-10 minute scene was by far the best and most entertaining in the entire movie; which is amazing considering the big special effects scenes scattered throughout this move. <br/><br/>My main quibble with this movie was the pacing and the dwarfs. This movie was almost three hours long and only covered a third of novel that was shorter than any of the LOTR novels. The reason for this is quite obvious, $$$$$!! This movie will make hundreds of millions of dollars, as will the other two Peter Jackson is currently making. The consequence of this for audiences is that the movie drags out for a prolonged amount of time, especially in the first act. My second problem was the dwarfs, there was Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Biflur, Bofor, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Oin, Glion, Nori, Dori, Ori...shall continue? There are just TOO many characters thrown at us in this movie and the only one we can connect with is Gollum, only because most of us have already seen him in the previous LOTR trilogy. <br/><br/>Although the ending was at a weird spot, the pacing was slow, and there were too many characters, this is a fairly satisfying popcorn flick that would be enjoyed by those who fell in love with the LOTR won't be disappointed, but they may not be overly-entertained."

The HFR 3D was great IMO. Jackson's goal was to create an immersed feel, and that's what I got from it. But it is such a COMPLETELY different experience that ""movie"" might not apply to HFR 3D presentations. I don't get these people who say it gave them nausea - I guess I'd have to have barf-bags in my car for those types. The bottom-line: if you're a Tolkien fan(or you liked LOTR), aren't the squeamish, vertigo type, and can deal with a completely new movie experience, go see the HFR 3D. Otherwise, it is still a good movie for the rest to see in 2D."
"Thomas-Giffin","8","3","9","30 December 2012"," Not as bad as you've heard
","There were many things that made me dubious about this film. Firstly, the decision to split a modest novel over three films seemed silly. There was also a lot of focus on the 48 frames per second filming speed instead of the usual 24 fps which was supposed to give the film a 'cheap' appearance. The running time and the side by side comparison with the excellent Lord of the Rings films also meant that the reviews in general were mixed, not as impressive as people had hoped.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was a great film which provided a lot of entertainment. I must admit to watching the film in 2D and the increased frame rate had no obvious impact on the film's look or feel. Certainly the sets, props and effects looked fantastic. Similar in tone and scope to The Fellowship of the Ring, the film certainly seems smaller than the epic scale battles of the last two LoTR films but everything looked fantastic.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is lighter than the LoTR films (because the stories had different tones too) so this is a much more light hearted film with the occasional song (not too many thankfully) and silly scene but overall there is still the hearty combat and fantasy violence you would expect from Middle Earth. Despite the difference in tone, the film remains emotionally powerful and filled with well drawn characters but lacks the immediate scenes of pure emotion such as the death of Boromir on LoTR: Fellowship. <br/><br/>Certainly it is a joy seeing all the returning actors in their various roles, Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf always being watchable and Christopher Lee as Saruman the White is fantastic, as his character differs greatly from the LoTR films. Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett are always entertaining as elves and Andy Serkis remains as mesmerising as ever as Gollum. The new characters are equally as well cast: Martin Freeman has a helplessly endearing quality which really suits young Bilbo Baggins and the dwarfs tend to blend into each other but certainly their leader, played by Richard Armitage, gives a performance which makes you believe in their plight. <br/><br/>Now, the film is certainly long, there is no doubt about that. However, the film never felt like it was dragging, even with the extensive opening in the Shire before the party sets off on their quest. Well fleshed out backstories betray the film's desire to stretch the material as far as possible but at no point during watching the film was I bored. In fact, the scenes in the Shire are the charming and the adventure is gripping, all the various characters which have been fleshed out via back story have important and well placed roles in the film. <br/><br/>All in all, the initial fears I had about the film were inflated by the mixed variety of the reviews but I am pleased to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film and look forward to the next instalment."

","I went to see the hobbit with mixed expectations. The trailer for this movie had gotten me really excited but I knew, that if I expected to see another masterpiece like the Lord of The Rings Trilogy I would probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>Now, I'll try to do this without giving away the plot of the movie. Which might be hard, considering the amount of actual 'plot' in this movie could be fit into the length of a simpsons episode.<br/><br/>Basically, the dwarfs try to take back their home and bilbo joins them on their journey to their former hometown.<br/><br/>From there on out, the group just seems to stumble from one bad situation into another, without much consistency or purpose. Things in this movie just.... happen. And that's fine I guess, as long as you don't ask any questions about it. Questions like: 'Where are we?', 'What are we doing here?', 'Who is this person?', 'Why does a goblin-king do belly dancing?'<br/><br/>Now you don't HAVE to ask these questions and just enjoy the movie for the action-overload it is. But then, you could be watching pretty much any action movie out there. Preferably one, that's not split into three parts and has a conclusive ending unlike this film.<br/><br/>Now there are one or two emotional moments in the story, that will actually grip you and have you waiting for more. But the movie won't wait long before swapping out interesting conflicts and characters with over the top action scenes.<br/><br/>The other really annoying parts about The Hobbit are the unfinished plot arcs. There's 3 main plot arcs in this movie and none of them are finished within the more than two hours runtime. <br/><br/>All in all, The Hobbit feels a lot like a standard Hollywood action-flick. Only that those movies usually don't require you to come back two times in order to see how they end."
"jarryds","7","3","9","25 December 2012"," Decent, but fails to capture the book's spirit
","Managed to see the film in 3D and High Frame Rate 48 FPS. The 3D was fine, but the 48FPS was awful. I won't say it ruined the film, because that's not fair. But it was far more noticeable than it should've been. At times things looked like they were moving far too fast. It felt like watching an American soap opera in the middle of the day. Best way I can put it. I'd read that the CGI was looking awful because of it, but I didn't really notice that. However if they want 48FPS to be the way of the future, CGI has to take several big steps forward. It's not up to that level yet. The Great Goblin (Barry Humpheries) comes too mind, it looked like CGI whereas in 24FPS they've got that down pat looking basically lifelike.<br/><br/>The film as a whole was all a bit meh. It felt like Jackson was trying to turn it into an epic, LOTR style film. Which The Hobbit isn't. I can only repeat words that many others have already used: Bloated, slow, overly drawn out. The scenes with old Bilbo and Frodo at the start (very start, no spoilers here) felt far longer than they needed to. The book starts with Bilbo meeting Gandalf, whereas in the film it took maybe 10- 15 minutes to get there. Felt like it was trying to emulate the prologue opening of LOTR. We could've had Thorin explain it later in the film, and would've been more effective in my opinion. Perhaps at that first camping scene?<br/><br/>Martin Freeman was brilliant, Richard Armitage was really good as Thorin. Ian McKellen was...Ian McKellen. But it just didn't have that sense of fun and adventure that The Hobbit book had. All throughout the movie there was this overwhelming sense of ""Shit's about to get messed up"", whereas in the book it had Bilbo's attitude of ""Gonna get some gold, why not?"".<br/><br/>It was okay, but so far it's the Jan Brady of the LOTR series. However, worth seeing solely for Martin Freeman."
"thefilmdiscussion","8","3","9","19 December 2012"," ""An Unexpected Journey"" is expected adventure and fun, ""LOTR Lite""
","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is mostly what you'd expect it to be. If you've seen Peter Jackson's ""LOTR Trilogy"" and have been keeping an eye on the TV spots and movie trailers, it's just like that. Not much more. And not that that's bad, the film is fantastic entertainment. However, it feels so much like a rehash of some of ""LOTR""'s most famous scenes that one could begin to think that the filmmakers, as they tried to stretch out a single book into three films, were running low on originality. Perhaps that's why they decided to go with the High Frame Rate format, a gimmick even cheaper than 3D that displays the film at twice the frame rate of standard projection, resulting in a hyper- realistic, sped up look that feels like a daytime soap opera. It is anything but cinematic (see it in IMAX, instead!). However, HFR and 3D do indeed compliment each other, and there are certainly grand possibilities here for the advancement of cinema. Just don't experiment with it on such important works as Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"". Save that for ""Avatar 2″. But I digress. The film itself covers the first third of the book, and introduces us to a much younger Bilbo as he reluctantly joins Gandalf the Wizard and a company of Dwarfs determined to reclaim their homeland from a wicked dragon. We won't see that fight until the second movie, though, so this film fills its nearly three-hour running time with trolls, giant spiders, goblins, and orcs. While some parts stretch a bit, there is plenty of adventure, sweeping vistas, and fighting to please every fan boy (the film has already shot to #88 on IMDb.com's Top 250, a sure sign of bloated fan boy love). The best scene by far, however, takes place deep in a cave, between Bilbo Baggins and a familiar face, Gollum. Their game of riddles to determine Bilbo's fate is perfectly written and is so full of wit, charm, and suspense that it threatens to spill out of the screen. Andy Serkis's masterful motion- capture performance outdoes anything he has ever done before. The man is sheer brilliance, and the day that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes that will be a great day indeed. He earns a spot as one of five Best Supporting Performances of 2012, in my book at least.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"
"luisaannfink","10","3","9","15 December 2012"," Love for what it is, not what it isn't
","First off, let me say that The Hobbit was a masterpiece. I have been following this film since I first heard that there was a possibility of it, back when there was rumors of casting Elijah Wood as Bilbo. I definitely had high expectations. Knowing and loving every detail of The Lord of the Rings, I knew that the Hobbit had to be just as good, and when Peter Jackson was announced as the director, what could be better? Admittedly, I knew it wouldn't be the same as Lord of the Rings, and that there would be things that maybe wouldn't suit me perfectly. But there was definitely nothing lacking. Now, don't write me off as one of those hopelessly gone fanatics who won't write a helpful review. Though I am slightly biased in that way, I will try my best to provide something helpful. When the New Line Cinema logo rolled in, I could not stop my restless excitement, but as the film began to play, I started feeling those pangs of disappointment. It wasn't just like Lord of the Rings, and I was sure that signified being 'not as good.' Elijah's voice wasn't exactly the same, and as a die-hard Frodo fan, I was ticked off;""whatisupwiththis? themusicisn'tlike...thecharactersaren'tlike...theeffectsaren'tas..."" I was wondering if I had seriously blown twenty bucks on another money- maker. But then I began to notice the skillfully done ""extra"" things that Peter had so skillfully woven into the film, the adorableness and naiveness of Bilbo, the beauty of the poignant and hilarious lines, and I began to think,""OH! Here's Lord of the Rings!! YAY!"" But then I was caught up in how awesome it was...without considering LOTR at all. It was then that I realized, that no, this is not Lord of the Rings. But it IS something just as good. Something that I can love as Middle Earth, as the Hobbit, another masterpiece that is definitely the Tolkien I love, but is the novelty I craved for. By the end, I was nearly in tears, because this was one of those films that made me realize that yes, there is still some good in the world."

","I'm not here to smash The Hobbit or favour it, I'm just going to put it in perspective of a viewer and a fan. Peter Jackson's way of displaying the story was different. This can be portrayed as either good or bad.<br/><br/>Story: The major events were portrayed differently than in the story which is to be expected as a movie too close to the book can be predictable and boring. The riddles between Bilbo and Gollum were the same which was one of the best parts in the movie. I would've liked the trolls to be tricked by Gandalf as in the book because it made it seem like Bilbo knew that Trolls could be killed by sunlight which didn't seem likely. They added a pale orc into the main story who is a rival of Thorin. I didn't like him especially since he was CGI'd. It was obvious. The rock giants scene felt a bit pushy in terms of putting things in. It was out of the blue and had no real purpose. Some of the dialogue was the same but it wasn't easy to tell when they were going to say it which I thought was great.<br/><br/>Effects: I am sorry to say but the orcs are now computer generated. I didn't like it. It was easy to tell whereas in LOTRO it felt like there was more connection between the characters. Gollum looked great as always. The 3-D added more to the story in terms of immersing you into certain areas. There's a part where a moth flies at the screen and since I hate bugs I moved a bit to get away from it and for a second forgot it wasn't real. The animals looked pretty real but you could tell when the horses were computerized and when they weren't.<br/><br/>If you are going to watch this movie, don't compare it to LOTRO, because it has some of the same feeling but it's more childish than it's predecessor. I kept expecting the rush that I got from watching LOTRO as a kid, but it wasn't there because this is it's own movie, although it is a prequel, it's its own movie in it's own right. Middle Earth felt the same in some respects which I loved. They had a way of explaining the differences between animals of LOTRO and The Hobbit so it wasn't too confusing. But this is a children's story and LOTRO was a bad a** otherworldly all out war movie. Comparing it to the book is good but don't expect everything to be the same. It's worth the money and the time and you'll never want this unforgettable journey to end."

","Very sad to say that this was a terrible film. High definition (at least in this cinema) was a complete washout, it looked like a bad episode of Dr Who, or one of those ""how we made this film"" films that they put on DVDs as a ""bonus"".. Mawkish sentimentality started and ended the story with poor set scenes and limited imagination in visualising middle earth, yes lots of panoramic views of New Zealand, but these were knitted into the film in a disjointed way. The only well crafted elements were the trolls and Gollum but the first of these characterisations were hampered by poor story structure. The introduction of non hobbit characters, a super Orc and Radagast, were an unwelcome departure, Radagast particularly odd; my conclusion being that Peter Jackson simply doesn't understand British comic effect. Jackson shows his roots in Gothic comics, completely at odds with one of the best children's books ever written. There's only one good thing about this film, and that is someone someday could still make the masterpiece that this book deserves."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","2","5","13 September 2016"," The road goes ever on and on
","Some people give me funny looks when I say I enjoyed the Hobbit films. There's this giant festering stigma around the entire trilogy that's hard to wade through if you are one who geniunly did enjoy a lot of what Peter Jackson brought us with his second barrage of Middle Earth sagas. Now don't get me wrong, there's plenty of things he muffed up, the chief aspect being editing and length. We did not ask for, need or want an entire LOTR lenghth trilogy based on a book that could have fit into one volume of that series. Jackson has a tendency to overreach, film too much and throw it all into his final cut. It started with the extended cuts of LOTR, which were somewhat unneeded, continued with King Kong, which could have been at least 45 minutes shorter, and has now climaxed with The Hobbit films. They're so long and stretched out that at times we realize we're not even watching stuff from Tolkien's annexes or archives, but simply stuff old Petey made up to pad the waistline of content that's begging to be slimmed down. I'm still waiting for a fan edit that condenses everything down into what is necessary to tell the story, and pitch everything else into the purgatorial halls of DVD deleted scene land. And therein lies my argument: There's gold to be found here, but a lot of folks are so turned off by all the unnecessary razzle dazzle that they have become blind to what actually worked. An Unexpected Journey kicks off the trilogy and definitely fares the best, feeling the most akin to the book. Martin Freeman is lovely as a young Bilbo, baffled to find thirteen rowdy dwarfs dumped on his doorstep, the work of Gandalf The Grey (Ian McKellen, like he never left the role), who wishes to prod him in the direction of a most dangerous and thrilling adventure. Bilbo is a mild creature and deeply in love with the comforts of home, but is whisked along all the same, after a chaotic dinner party and plate throwing contest from this knobbly group of mountain dwelling pygmies. Orcs, Wargs, Goblins, colossal mountain giants and an appearance by the ever fascinating Gollum await them. There's an interlude into Elrond's heavenly glade where Gandalf, Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) have a little CSI: Rivendell episode with an ancient dagger that hints towards the return of Sauron. One thing Jackson added that is a highlight is additional wizard Radagast The Brown (Sylvester McCoy) an eccwntric hippie who rides a chariot led by massive rabbits in breakneck bouts of Need For Speed: Middle Earth with Orcs atop Wargs. A distinct feature about these films compared to LOTR is the ramping up of CGI; many Orcs are no longer stuntmen in gloriously goopy makeup, but giant computer rendered behemoths, taking some of the texture and authenticity away. Jackson also chose to shoot in many more frames per second than the human eye is used to, giving everything a strange, wax museum sheen that is pretty distracting. Close your bag of tricks and make us a goddamn straightforward flick Pete. Fvck sake. For all the issues, it's terrific to be back in Middle Earth, however different it looks and feels. The production design is still an elaborate wonder of creative design and decoration, Howard Shore's now timeless score makes a triumphant return and there's a beautiful new song courtesy of the dwarfs. Say what you want, bitch and moan til the Wargs come home, I love this first outing dearly and rank it nearly as high as LOTR. I can't say the same for the next two, especially the exhausting Battle Of Five Armies which diminished my patience for Jackson and his tricks a whole lot. But, like I said, there's always gold to be mined from the needless padding that's been tossed in. One day someone will edit that perfect cut for us, and we'll have that definitive Hobbit film. Until then, cherry pick the best parts and try to put the rest from your mind."
"Tyson14","10","2","5","10 December 2014"," a brilliant start to the trilogy
","Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not a direct adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved children's story The Hobbit. And if that's what you want, you will be disappointed. This is a prequel to the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Something that became apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It's clearly framed as that. If you didn't like those movies... you won't like this one.<br/><br/>It is not a stand alone story. If you want something that is complete in and of itself... you won't like this movie. On the other hand. If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of Middle-earth there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the prequel. Visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of LOTR.<br/><br/>A lot has been made of the fact that a small children's book has been turned into three movies. To be honest I always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly. Because the Hobbit at some 320 pages (depending on the version you have) is not actually that short. Most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story.<br/><br/>One of the pleasures of An Unexpected Journey was that everything was there. It was frustrating to me in the Lord of the Rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed (and I'm not even talking about Tom Bombadil who I don't particularly care for). That isn't a problem here in fact the humour and lightness of The Hobbit is actually present in the film, particularly in the earlier scenes. Complete with songs. And yes we get Dwalin, Balin, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur, Fili and Kili and of course Thorin Oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion.<br/><br/>And it's a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarfs, many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own, each of them does seem quite distinctive but what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story. We get to see what was going on while Gandalf was not with the dwarfs. And this isn't just made up. It is based solidly on the material in the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. I should know, I read them often enough.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I love that material and I loved the time it got here. I loved that they were able to finally slot Radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy speaking of Radagast the Brown, he had some of my favourite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual Tolkien text. Yeah maybe they over-egged the drug user references with both the pipe-weed sequence and the mushrooms comment, but Sylvester McCoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie.<br/><br/>The introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably. In truth The Hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate. By emphasising the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward.There are some liberties taken with characterisation. Probably less than in The Lord of the Rings but the dwarfs in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book.The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Ian McKellan is of course always brilliant. And of the dwarfs Kenn Stott as Balin in particular just nails his role. In fact if I had seen this first I would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in Fellowship of the Ring because you can feel a connection between Balin and Bilbo and you can see why he's respected. James Nesbit as Bofur, Aidan Turner as Kili, Dean o Gorman as Fili and Richard Armitage as Thorin all excel in their roles as well. And of course there is Andy Serkis returning to the role of Gollum.Which brings me nicely to Bilbo Baggins himself. As portrayed by Martin Freeman. Freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie, but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes. And while some of his mannerism, the same ones we saw in The Office and Sherlock are there, within the first 40 minutes I was watching Bilbo Baggins not Martin. <br/><br/>This is a long movie. The running time is 169 minutes. So almost 3 hours. I can see that in the cinema I might have found that too much. But sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever I wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom, I had no trouble with the length at all. The movie kept me interested the whole time.<br/><br/>I loved the movie. Enjoyed all of it. Purists will hate it. People who just wanted The Hobbit will hate it. Some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the Middle-earth background as I am."

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey brings back a flood of old memories as we are welcomed back to Middle Earth, nine years after the Return of the King. The Hobbit is just as awesome as any of those films, even though it's more of a different film. This is more light-hearted and colorful than the LOTR trilogy. However, the film is still very lengthy but there are some good action scenes, many funny moments, excellent CGI, and great acting. This film reminds me of the Fellowship of the Ring, but in a good way of course.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson returns to direct the first of this new trilogy and it's set sixty years before the events of the LOTR. Bilbo Baggins has been recruited by Gandalf and thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield to reclaim their mountain that was taken away by Smaug, a fierce dragon.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. We see some familiar faces here in the likes of Ian McKellan, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee. Some of these actors shouldn't have been in this film, but nonetheless their parts are still good. McKellan still makes a great Gandalf. Andy Serkis makes a welcome return as Gollum and the riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum is perhaps the greatest moment of this film. As for the newcomers, Martin Freeman makes a great Bilbo and is better than what I have thought. Richard Armitrage is great as Thorin, the leader of the dwarfs.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit is an excuse just to reach into Middle Earth again, but a great excuse. I wasn't expecting a return here, but I'm most definitely glad there was. I'm fine with all the additions to the story because if anything, it enhances it. It's nice to see background of what happened to our heroes. A fantastic beginning of this new trilogy. I rate this film 10/10."
"GTeixeira","6","2","5","29 March 2014"," A lackluster return to Middle-Earth
","For a long while Tolkien's work was deemed almost unfilmable. Yet, anyone who has seen 'The Lord of the Rings' knows this maxim is not true anymore. Peter Jackson did an excellent job in bringing to life Tolkien's masterpiece, so he decided to go back and also do his other introductory work: 'The Hobbit', an adventure that kinda sets up the events for the LotR adventure.<br/><br/>Yet, this time around Jackson didn't manage the same amount of success.<br/><br/>'The Hobbit' was already much more light-hearted, quasi-comedic in relation to its sequel, but 'An Unexpected Journey' goes a bit farther than needed. Far too much buffoonery, specially in its overlong introduction of the characters. Overlong introduction which, by the way, describes two points of my complaints against this.<br/><br/>Like with 'Fellowship of the Ring', this ends up as mostly an introductory chapter. This is comprehensible, as most of these characters weren't even on the LotR films; still, while 'Fellowship' introduced and made sure to give each character an uniqueness, 'Journey' does not. The company of dwarfs are mostly personality-less; other than Thorin and the old dwarf, all others end up as mere background characters to the point it is not worthy (nor necessary) trying to remember their names. The addition of even more plot elements, some of which weren't even in the book, also hurts this a lot.<br/><br/>Another problem is its length. Unlike LotR, 'The Hobit' is not big enough to warrant a trilogy (maybe two-parts, but not three). As such, Jackson has to make the film move at a snail's pace, dragging events and scenes far too long; at times, it makes what could have been a good scene boring and/or lose its impact/importance. Its terrible pace is such, this movie is almost 3-hour long when it could have been told and finished in mere 2-hours.<br/><br/>Not only that, Jackson (or possibly Guillermo Del Toro, who was originally the one to do the script) litters the film with unnecessary scenes/plots not from its original source. They still keep to the nature of Tolkien's world, true, like the bit with Radagast and the whole Orc plot line, but they are overtly unnecessary. Like when he did LotR, Peter Jackson seems insecure of his storytelling and public's reaction to it, and forcefully changes the source material to seem more 'mainstream' and 'attractive' to audiences.<br/><br/>As a result of its terrible pace and changes, the film drags on too much and takes away from the enjoyment, from the magic of Tolkien's mythos.<br/><br/>The film is still good, despite those flaws. It still retains the incredible visual quality of the LotR trilogy, which helps making its pace somewhat bearable; still, as good as its effects are, at points it feels like it is dragging on purposefully to show off them (ie.: the 'mountain fighting' scene, which was kinda ridiculous). The casting is great as well: not only the returners from LotR (Ian McKellen once again steals the show as Gandalf, and we also get Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and even Andy Serkis as Gollum), but Martin Freeman is excellent as Bilbo (in special, his altercation with Gollum) and Richard Armitage as Thorin.<br/><br/>The action and adventure aspects of the story are very good and the film still is entertaining, though very far from 'Lord of the Rings' level. <br/><br/>Tolkien's characters and fantasy world is always good to watch, and Peter Jackson (despite all his insecurities) truly knows how to capture it in all its visual splendor; however, the film itself drags on to the point of boredom thanks to its horrendous pacing and the whole deviancy from the original storyline proves not only unneeded, but might actually put off the more rabid Tolkien followers."
"sjc-tech","7","2","5","29 March 2014"," A lengthy but riveting film, well worth your time.
","At 2 hours and 49 minutes, this film is lengthy but well worth it in the end, although it does take about an hour and a half to get any real plot development. <br/><br/>The acting talent of Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and Martin Freeman (Bilbo) are particularly noteworthy. Most of the humour shown arises from the facial expressions of Bilbo. It's a dry humour that I'm particularly fond of. Thorin (Richard Armatige), I find, isn't very believable as a character, and the acting here is quite poor. <br/><br/>I noticed that the size scale of the Hobbits and the Dwarfs are inconsistent. There's a point where Bilbo is shown to be only slightly taller than a fully grown pig, then later he's shown to be just as big as a pony. <br/><br/>The graphics are incredible and realistic. Your sympathy for Sebastian the Hedgehog and hatred of the pale Orc Azog is dramatised via the graphics, and this is what they're for. <br/><br/>The dialogue could be improved. Half of the plot movement is created through dialogue, but the information you need is not clear. Some information is missed out altogether - when you first see the Goblins I thought they were Trolls. <br/><br/>I've always loved the Lord of the Rings score, but here it could be improved. At around 1 hour and 55 minutes, in a scene where the group are travelling across the mountains of Middle-Earth, the music could be a little more demanding, it should have more 'oomph.' <br/><br/>The battle scenes are directed brilliantly. The camera shots are perfect; where in most films you'd go from fight to fight, and be unable to make sense of it, this film is a massive improvement. The gore is kept to a minimum, which I admire, but some horror is included. The horror isn't necessary but it makes the film more riveting, and would be worse without it. <br/><br/>I loved the ending. It's a perfect way to create suspense for the next film ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug."""

","I will start this by reminding folk I do not read the books although I did read The Hobbit at school I remember little about it. I enjoyed the LOTR trilogy to some degree but also agree with the whole theory that it was just a long walk. When it was announced that The Hobbit would be made into three movies even though it was just one book I feared that his was just a license to print money and would be very stretched. Having watched it I still feel it's going to be stretched a great deal. Having said all that I did enjoy the film. It has a great cast, mainly driven by UK actors. Freeman is a good choice for our younger Bilbo and Nesbit & Stott lend a nice familiarity to their dwarf characters with Armitage bringing his trademark scowl to Thorin. Again though it is another walking movie across middle-earth, ramblers must love these films. It is however bright and breezy, a lot lighter than the Rings movies. Even so it still has it's harrowing events of which there are a few. I was a bit disappointed with some of the effects mainly the scenes between the smaller & larger characters but in other places they are particularly stunning. Most will know the story as Thorin and his followers set out to reclaim their home mountain. Bilbo Baggins is reluctantly dragged along as the group's ""burgular"". It's a good romp and it only remains to be seen how stretched it gets should two and three also come in at over 160 minutes."
"sclader","9","2","5","18 March 2014"," Wonderful series
","I love this series. Many times I've watched this series. I'm bored watching again. The cinematography was perfect and the character development was extraordinary. The film was very well paced and at no point did i believe the film was too short or that I felt rushed during the movie. There is nothing wrong with that. For me, this is the most beautifully looking film I've seen this year. The cinematography and camera shots were fantastic. It's not all bad of course, so although Peter Jackson has been caught up in the special-effects machine, he still shows his talent for the spectacle with one action scene that sees the dwarfs escape Mirkwood and a micro army of rampant orcs in barrels down a river. It is a silly, overblown set-piece, but it proves funny and thrilling, a genuinely exciting highlight within one of the film's most drawn-out chapters. Also, Smaug himself doesn't disappoint. Although he's entirely CGI, the giant beast is entirely real and, thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch, uncomfortably menacing. His exchanges with Bilbo are the movie's best moments, as they both try and outsmart each other with words and tricks. Which makes it all the more disappointing when the film movies into yet another overwrought action scene."

","I am watching the three Hobbit movies before I see the three Lord Of The Rings movies, so this was my first time entering the world of Middle Earth that people love so much.<br/><br/>Now of course, they're dividing the Hobbit book up into three movies, which can sometimes make for dull waiting periods to kill time, and there is a CRAPLOAD of time killing in this movie. Whether it's walking or riding to where the action takes place, or letting the viewer watch nothing as we wait for something to happen gets old and boring after a while.<br/><br/>That being said, all the characters are believable, especially Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf The Great, who basically acts as a leader/babysitter of the dwarfs throughout the movie, always knowing where to go and many times saving everyone from danger. Gandalf is what makes the movie so interesting, as there are a lot of boring parts that pepper the rest of this 2.5 hour movie.<br/><br/>See this movie and the two sequels before you see the three LOTR movies."

","I love it! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a brilliant start to an amazing trilogy. As epic as the Lord of the Rings, every second of the film I was amazed with the acting, the scenery, the special effects, everything! The casting was perfect and everything was perfect. I loved the scenes when Gandalf, Bilbo and the dwarfs try to escape from the misty mountains from the goblin king and his minions. The scene when Bilbo was playing riddles with Gollum was very dark and eerie because Gollum is sometimes no where to be seen and you have no idea what he will do. I do recommend this film for any LotR fan because if you like LotR, you will like The Hobbit. I can't wait to see The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug because it looks EPIC! Like I said, this film is a masterpiece. Why? All because of the great cast and Peter Jackson's wonderful job as director. Definitely WATCH THIS FILM AND WATCH IT SOON!!!!!!"
"hamboTjorvi","10","2","5","16 December 2013"," Did not disappoint
","This movie is a film i had been itching to see after the announcement was made that the movie adaptation of the book witch i absolutely loved as a kid was finally coming out after a long break from the Middle earth franchise that we all know and love, this trilogy from the Tolkien epic had some big shoes to fill after the previous trilogy was wildly successful and swooped in a whooping 30 academy award nominations and taking home the win in 17 of them including the 11 awards the third one swept in, and not to forget the close to 3 BILLION dollars at the box office.<br/><br/>This movie was in my opinion a very great movie in all places, unlike many people i actually enjoyed the things that Peter Jackson added into the movie and removed did actually help the story run fluidly and really kept the franchise going and gave it a very good prequel, even though it did not compare to the greatness of the previous trilogy but it did hold up to the expectation of a great film from in a very promising trilogy.<br/><br/>This movie had new technology in film making and was shot in 48 fps, 5k, 3D. This has had very mixed reactions, but personally it did not bother me, i definitely did notice it but i got used to it in a mater of minutes. The 3D in this film was very good and did what in my opinion 3D is made for, to get you more into the film experience and forget that you are watching a 3D film. This film did exactly that, it was very good.<br/><br/>Now for the story and film making. The book is a children's book unlike ""The Lord of the Rings"" which is targeted for older audiences. This movie did hold up to the childish part of the book but sometimes it did come of as silly and unnecessary for the flow of the story and could really not strike with the die hard fans of the LOTR series. The visual effects were breathtaking, both in goblins, Orcs and especially in Gollum. Somehow the achieved to make this quite ugly creature very beautiful looking. The acting in this movie was in my opinion flawless. The casting was perfect, Martin Freeman did a great job at bringing Bilbo to life and made him a just as good or not even better than Frodo was in the LOTR trilogy. The reprising actors fit right back into character as expected and all the Dwarfs were surprising and brought a real funny spark into the movie.<br/><br/>all and all this movie did not disappoint and lived up to expectation, one of the best movies of 2012."
"MarkOBannon","10","2","5","18 November 2013"," A great adaptation of the book
","The Hobbit movie was a great adaptation of the book. I was delighted to see how they wove stories from some of Tolkien's other works into this one. In some ways, I enjoyed this movie more than LOTR. One of my favorite parts was when the dwarfs sang their songs in the first part of the story. Though I didn't picture the songs this way when I read the book I loved the way they composed the music for the movie. There are a few changes so the movie doesn't match the book completely. They left out a few of the riddles from the book and one of the riddles was shortened a few lines. Gollum did recite one of the riddles in LOTR. All in all, a great story has been turned into a great movie. I went to see it in the theater three times! :)"
"nikhil-damodaran","6","2","5","16 September 2013"," Average
","This movie should not be compared to the Lord of the Rings. It doesn't match the lord of the rings in any way. What it does is to elaborate on the chain of events which preclude the LOTR. <br/><br/>The plot is much simpler and the concepts are relatively familiar. There is no surprise in the way the characters are developed. To be fair to the director, building a prequel is much more difficult than a sequel. <br/><br/>However the screenplay (to use a more fancy word for story) is along the lines of an adventure the movie promises upon. As was expected, they have left the story unfinished. This, I think is dragging it a bit since mot parts of the movie there is nothing really concrete.<br/><br/>Given all these limitations, its still worth a watch. The movie is still smooth and has similar element mystique. <br/><br/>For all the above I give it a 6 on 10."
"Enizave","6","2","5","15 September 2013"," I would give more stars but...
","The Hobbit was the first book I read as a child on my own. It was the first book that got me hooked onto fantasy. So you can say I'm a huge fan of JRR Tolkien's works (loved the other ones!!). Also, I love Peter Jackson's LOTR, it may have been tweaked here and there but it was really OK and I was able to enjoy the movie 10/10 without being ""Wait that guy didn't say that"" and ""Tom Bombadil is missing"" etc.<br/><br/>That being said, I was a little disappoint with The Hobbit. I felt like it was aiming to the general population to wow them rather than showing them the adventurous story that it is. Why do I think that way? For one, they added the white orc character just for the extra ""OMG Drama~"" and fighting sequence (in my opinion) and he's actually suppose to be in a different book rather than The Hobbit. <br/><br/>A lot of the things felt different from the LOTR that Peter did, like he's got the recognition and the money now and it could just be me being overly picky but I felt that it might have actually ""ruined"" the film. Peter did the LOTR because his passion and love for the books but The Hobbit had a more money grabby feel to it. I hope I am wrong. I understand why they wanted 3 parts to the book (they can show more of it without skipping anything/anyone and more money!).<br/><br/>I still enjoyed the movie, I love the cast, Peter Jackson has a great team and cast hands down.<br/><br/>My actual rating would be 6 1/2 - 7."
"domienappelsien","10","2","5","29 July 2013"," Masterful!
","There was always a certain ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" dilemma to the filming of ""The Hobbit"" and I think Peter Jackson knew that going in, which may be why it took him so long to take on the project as director. ""The Lord of the Rings"" was famous for being unfilmable until Jackson did it and proved he could not only make a good adaptation of the material, he could actually turn it into one of the greatest commercial AND critical successes of all time. However, I think ""The Hobbit"" is a harder book to film, especially after the success of the Ring-triloy. It's essentially a children's story that Tolkien wrote mostly for his own kids and long before he had any idea himself how it all tied in with his vast mythology. Because of that, the book has a very light, childlike tone, and yet it still exists in the same universe as all the other, much grander and more dramatic tales of Middle-Earth. <br/><br/>How do you maintain the lighter touch and charming magic of ""The Hobbit"" while also making it a credible prequel to LOTR? How to you balance the jolly ""let's go on an adventure"" feel with something that works for contemporary cinema goers who desire to see some action and drama taking place? How do you make sure those 13 dwarfs don't become a homogenous blur of beards and hoods while still retaining respect for Tolkien's vision? How do you bring a sense of menace and danger into the film without sacrificing its humour? And so on... It's an incredibly difficult and fine line to walk. I think the writers took a gutsy decision by deciding to tell not just the story of Bilbo's adventure, but to tell it as a real prequel trilogy to LOTR. It is after all something Tolkien himself desired to do but never got round to. <br/><br/>With seemingly effortless joy, ""An Unexpected Journey"" manages to capture all the magic and heart of the book while also giving us an insight into the depth of the history of Middle-Earth and hinting to the coming darkness of Sauron AND on top of that, it's just a rollicking good action adventure that any 13 year-old should love. Jackson's adaptation does all that and manages to elegantly honour the human themes in Tolkien's work as well: Bilbo's ""Tookish"" side winning over his reserved ""Baggins"" side is a genuinely inspiring call to adventure for all of us. The compassion Bilbo grants Gollum is delivered poignantly and beautifully and sets something up that pays off years later in ""The Return of the King"". Thorin's pride and stubbornness are introduced, leading up to what is sure to become a baffling and powerful climax in the third installment of this trilogy. All of the dwarfs are given genuine personality. The acting is superb. Richard Armitage's Thorin in particular is a sublime performance, both threatening and noble at once, single-minded in his pursuits yet always concerned for the safety of his friends.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's score is both light-footed and fairy tale-like and suitably grand and epic where needed, all while tying into the established themes of his ""Rings"" scores with precision and dedication. The truth is, movies like this are rare and exceptional. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is both a first-class cinema adventure for all ages as well as one of the best and most challenging adaptations of a literary work ever put on film."

For those fans of the original books by JRR Tolkien, the humor and story are almost perfectly in alignment with the original book. For those who read the ""Silmarillion"" and the other historical books containing the full mythology of middle earth it incorporates almost all of the knowledge of Middle-Earth history at that time, at the cost of a portion of the story, of course. Some Major changes, the Lady Galadriel and Sarumon the White make an appearance. Also, Radagast the Brown makes his first true appearance in ANY Tolkien-based media. The unwitting traitor/liberator/traitor again/true natural wizard who was only mentioned in the original ""Hobbit"" book as a passing comment, being used as ""Gandalf bait"" by Saruman and being Gandalf's liberator in the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and unwittingly giving Saruman control of the birds in the ""Silmarillion"", is completely glossed over and he is given a new role serving as a warning of the coming darkness. I liked it, but it wasn't truly giving ""Saruman's Fall Guy"", as I call him, justice. All in all, it was a brilliant retelling of the original."

","Special effects are getting better and The Hobbit captures a bit of the magic from the Lord of the Rings trilogy from a decade ago. 10 years of CGI advancement show a noticeable improvement. This movie is long, so it is best viewed from rented at your own leisure. Get up and stretch to avoid Peter Jackson induced blood clots. Jackson takes great care with each and every scene, unlike the Ryan Reynolds-esque movies that are thrown together with zero plot or stage setting. The ""boring"" parts are beautiful in their own with the Shire's scenery and wide open blue skies. The action gets a little exhausting when placed one after another. Jackson believes bigger is better. The musical score is awesome; the scenery on location and CGI is awesome; and the acting is awesome. The story is a little weird to the Jamie Foxx generation who thinks North Korean could invade us, i.e. the teenage vampire zombie lovers out there who the JJ Abrams market to. The fast CGI of the SPOILER dwarfs vs. the trolls seems to be the norm for Hollywood these days; sort of an Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom roller coaster on CGI steroids.

","I am so disappointed. Jackson turned this great classic story into 3 boring hours of meaningless conflict that dragged on and on and on. He could have told the entire Hobbit in one film! Why a trilogy? I fear the profit motive must have been more important than making a truly great film, because the potential certainly existed. In this film, the scenery was great and so was the singing. I loath the cartooning effects in this movie and found that just distracting. None of the characters were developed with the exception of our main character. We were given nothing about the elves which are as fascinating as any of the action. The elf queen had no personality; she was a like a paper doll, flat with no affect, and boring. The movie takes us from one pointless battle to another with only scenery for filler. In summary, Jackson took a well-developed, perfect story, and tried to modernize it as some action-packed thing with all the tricks of the trade. It did not work."

The prequel to the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit, gets a bit dragged down in exposition. But manages to turn it around and builds up it's momentum to the conclusion of this film, that has left me looking forward to the next chapter in the series.<br/><br/>The story is similar to the LotR in that Gandalf (the impeccable Sir Ian McKellen) Recruits Bilbo Baggins, played my Martin Freeman. To join a quest. This time accompanying a company of 13 dwarfs as they travel to take back their home, which was long a go taken from them. Martin Freeman really was the best choice to play Bilbo, showing the characters innate hidden courage, and adding an every man quality to the character. Two of the best characters returned from the original trilogy, as already mentioned one is Sir Ian McKellen, and the other is Andy Serkis as Gollum. With Gollum and Bilbo supplying my favourite scene from the movie, and the famous game of riddles played between the two characters. Which had real terror and tension built up over the course of the scene. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it is not all positive, as said previously it does take a while to get going, and requires some patience from the audience. Which may be asking to much from some. Also Peter Jackson who is a very good user of special effects. which are generally good through out this movie. But the scenes inside the Goblin cave with the Goblin King were pretty awful in a visual and scripting stand point. <br/><br/>Not the classic, that many were expecting, But a very good start to what should be a very entertaining second trilogy from middle earth."

Ian McKellen delivered once again but the real star of the show had to be Andy Serkis.

He did feature in the appendixes like Radagast but not in such an important role, in the film he merely serves to have an evil villain before the introduction of Smaug.<br/><br/>Nonetheless this is a great film and anyone who enjoyed Lord of the Rings should see it therefore earning a well deserved 8/10"

The problem I believe lies in the fact that it feels like they are taking so long. I get it. The LOTR movies are 2 hours long each but they were all based on separate books. The Hobbit is one book and because of that it feels like this one got stretched out far more than it should have. I still liked it but at times I felt like they were just ripping off the other films and just wanting to make it a trilogy so that it can be like the Star Wars prequels.

"Tomas_T","6","2","5","29 March 2013"," Slow start for the Hobbit trilogy
","After some 10 years since his grandeous Lord of the Rings trilogy, director Peter Jackson is ready to unleash his next great nerdgasm for the masses in form of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The film is the first part of a trilogy based on J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit novel and very much focuses on building the foundation for the upcoming sequels.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly Jackson's new Hobbit film holds a lot resemblance with his previous Middle Earth fantasy films, no reason to break a winning concept right? Unfortunately things are not perfect with Jackson's latest landscape tour of New Zeland. This already becomes painfully evident from the draggingly slow introduction scene which seemingly go on forever, thankfully the pace picks up after the slow start, but here and there are scenes which feel prolongued on purpose. There is a simple explanation for the pacing and screenplay issues; with the film's script closely following the original novel (besides some odd addition from the producers), the book's ~300 pages barely carry enough content for a single film, let alone for a Trilogy!.<br/><br/>Another evident difference with Hobbit compared to the LotR films is the quite substantial difference in atmosphere. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey feels at times even childish compared to the more mature and darker LotR films. Again the explanation can be traced to the director's choice to make the film resemble the novel as closely as possible, and as it is widely known, J.R.R Tolkien's Hobbit is a children's fantasy fable at heart. I respect the director's choice to honor the novel by making the depiction resemble the original novel closely, but especially the funny humor stemming from the novel's less mature origins does feel out of place in otherwise mature production.<br/><br/>But there is a lot good in An Unexpected Journey as well. The story is much more linear and easier to follow than with LotR films where the story is carried forth by separated character sets. Also despite some prolonged scenes, the Hobbit is overall well paced and contains good mix of fast paced action and slower scenes. I also found the few songs and the musical twist it brought into the film very pleasing. Lastly but not least, Jackson's latest film is visually stunning and offers a very stimulating film experience with its latest and greatest special effects seemingly integrated with New Zeland's breathtaking scenery. <br/><br/>Perhaps the weakest link of the film was the character set that is understandably challenging. With 13 almost identical Dwarfs accompanying a Wizard and a Hobbit plus plethora of supporting characters, it is easy to see why even nearly 3h running time is not enough to familiarize with each character.<br/><br/>Thus The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey overall might be a less successful Trilogy launch than LotR: The Fellowship of the Ring was, but by no means a complete disaster. However should the Hobbit Trilogy wish to rise on par with the LotR films the successor Hobbit films need to be considerably stronger candidates."
"BeatleFloydZeppelin","7","2","5","23 March 2013"," Really Good, But not Quite The Lord Of the Rings!
","The Lord of the Rings movies are some of my favourite films of all time, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey comes close, but a few problems hold it back from being truly fantastic. <br/><br/>ACTING: 8/10<br/><br/>The acting from the main cast members is on par with the Lord of the Rings. Ian Mckellen is always wonderful, and Richard Armitage is fantastic as the dwarf king Thorin. Martin Freeman was very well cast as Bilbo, and he gives a lot of humanity to the film. The rest of the dwarfs are fine, however, they never really get their chance to shine as they only have a few lines each. Hopefully we will see more of the dwarfs in the next two sequels. There are a few returning cast members as well, including some big names. While their acting was good overall, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Ian Holm occasionally over act their parts, perhaps to make up for their lack of screen time.<br/><br/>WRITING: 6/10<br/><br/>This is where most of the problems of the film arise. The movie is too long in parts. The Old Bilbo/ Frodo scenes (while interesting) could have been trimmed, much of the unexpected party scene could have been cut (especially the first song about dishes), and the chase scene with Radagast could have been trimmed. A few of the scenes that connect the Lord of the Rings (the white council, Radagast, etc) could have been shortened. There are also a few one liners and toilet humour jokes that fall flat. Also, the film has a number of ""fan boy moments"" that mimic or reference the Lord of the Rings but do not progress the plot in any way. The Hobbit is a very difficult film to bring to the big screen, and overall the writers did decent job. The first part of the trilogy was always going to be the worst. I expect that the next movie will end with the destruction of Lake Town, and the third film will be a huge battle, so I have no problem with the way they decided to split the film into three parts.<br/><br/>DESIGN: 9/10<br/><br/>The design is just as good as the Lord of the Rings, which makes sense as it is the same people. The map paintings, sets, miniatures, characters, wardrobe, and weapons all look great. Some of the dwarfs look a little bit strange, however, maybe this is intentional.<br/><br/>EFFECTS: 8/10<br/><br/>Some have complained that the CGI in this movie looks fake, and I couldn't disagree more. The CGI looks fantastic, maybe better than any movie this year. There is a problem with too much CGI though. The great thing about the Lord of the Rings is that they avoided using CGI unless necessary, and used sets, prosthetics, and camera angle tricks instead. In the Hobbit, CGI is the go to method, which is unfortunate because no matter how good it is, CGI will always look worse than the real thing. <br/><br/>MUSIC: 7/10<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very similar to the Lord of the Rings, in fact, it is too similar. I loved the soundtrack the Lord of the Rings, however, the Hobbit soundtrack feels like a repeat of the same thing. There are a few new songs such as the Lonely Mountain theme, and they all sound great. I hope that Howard Shore expands on these themes and adds new ones in the next two films. <br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable film, but it never quite reaches the heights of the Lord of the Rings (except for perhaps the gollum scene). As long as people except that, there is no reason that anyone should not enjoy this movie. Overall, I give it a 7.6/10"

"JulianMHall","8","2","5","6 January 2013"," Excellent if a little slow in places..
","For clarification, this review is based on the UK cinema release of The Hobbit in HFR 3D.<br/><br/>The most talked about aspect of this movie in particular has been the choice of 48 frames per second (fps) High Frame Rate in which to film, aka HFR. It seems sensible to address this aspect first.<br/><br/>I have seen various reviews from complaints of headaches, to the high tech distracting from the story. Despite having a slightly lazy eye myself I suffered no headaches, nor did I feel the HFR 3D detracted from my enjoyment of the movie. Thus on those points I conclude that it is a personal / subjective issue and should not alone detract you from viewing the movie. One aspect I was occasionally aware of was that the edges seemed overly well defined in the 3D areas (in technical terms the anti-aliasing was for me a touch harsh sometimes). Whether this is common to all 3D or only HFR 3D I am unable to say as this was my first foray into 3D. Overall I found that aspect thoroughly enjoyable and actually allowed me to immerse myself *more* in the story than normal rather than detracting.<br/><br/>Now to the film content itself. There will be inevitable comparisons with the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy, both based on works by the same author, and brought to the cinema by the same director. However there is a major distinction between the two in that the Hobbit was originally conceived as a children's book whereas the LOTR was always intended for an adult audience.<br/><br/>It seems overall this dichotomy presented something of a quandary to the director. Had he aimed The Hobbit at a mainly child audience he would have lost a great many adult cinema-goers. Therefore The Hobbit has a more adult feel to it that the book. However the movie then satisfies the financiers by attaining a 12A certificate (in the UK this means children 12 or under may see it provided they are accompanied by an adult but are not prohibited completely). This coupled with scenes such as the 'washing up' gives a mildly contradictory flavour between that and the gravitas brought to the film by the likes of Armitage and Freeman.<br/><br/>It is ironic that in Tolkien's major work aimed at adults LOTR the sole dwarf present, Gimli, is reduced frequently to the role of comedy dwarf 'dangerous over short distances', yet in the work aimed at children, the dwarfs are presented as Tolkien always intended, a proud, honourable, brave race. The dwarfs of The Hobbit are cast in the latter mould which is a far more authentic role and much more pleasing to those familiar with the original works. I was initially concerned with the publicity photos released with the wide disparity in appearances, however with one or two exceptions - which I will come to in a moment - I have come to really like the variations.<br/><br/>The exceptions come in the form of Fili, Kili, and last but not least, the lead character, Thorin Oakenshield. Dwarfs are as a rule without exception stocky and short, with wide broad features, and of course the ubiquitous 'beard you could hide a badger in'. All three appear to me to be too good-looking to be dwarfs, in the case of the younger ones lacking the mandatory beard.<br/><br/>I have friends who admire Richard Armitage as an actor who take exception to my criticism of him as Thorin. They miss the fact that I am *not* criticising his acting of the role, which is as superb as that which he brings to every role he is given. His mannerisims, behaviour and general aura exude dwarf from every pore. However where I *do* think the ball has been dropped is by the make-up department. Armitage is naturally tall and of slim build, the exact opposite of a dwarf - indeed had he been cast as an elf I would have deemed it a perfect choice. All these issues could have been addressed by the makeup department, yet to my eye he is still unmistakeably Richard Armitage with the same slim facial features which have only received minor attention from prosthetics. Could have been better.<br/><br/>The scenery and sets of course were perfect, Bag End, Hobbiton and Rivendell being the same locations and sets as used in LOTR. New locations were as expected perfectly selected and the new sets such as the Goblin Kingdom were excellently achieved.<br/><br/>Dialogue was 95% good with the occasional Americanism and/or modern usage slipping in.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie has come in for criticism, and at times with good reason. Peter Jackson took 12 hours to portray the 1500 pages of LOTR, which is a rate of 125 pages per hour or two per minute. The Hobbit is approximately 380 pages, and if Jackson sticks to his 3 movie target he will achieve about 9 hours in total, which will be a rate of 42 pages per hours, about 0.6 per minute. He has stated that there will be additional content from Tolkien's appendices; yet he has already squandered a major opportunity in condensing the White Council - which the book gives the impression of being a major event albeit it is not portrayed - into about 15 minutes of screen time. Yet in other places the film felt padded, particularly the length of time it took the party to leave Hobbiton felt a little stretched. Once on the road though the pace increased to an acceptable level.<br/><br/>In summary there is good and bad in The Hobbit but I feel that despite the bad I have highlighted it still merits the high mark I have awarded to it and is a 'Must See' movie."
"cheez_41","6","2","5","5 January 2013"," 48 FPS Clouded my Judgement
","As we prepared for the return of PJ in tackling further adventures in Middle Earth, I think it's safe to say that it was unavoidable that this new trilogy would be weighed and measured against the masterpiece that is the LOTR. In short, this project does not measure up on many levels, and even more frustrating, I feel like I couldn't even properly or fairly form an opinion on this piece because of Jackson's production decisions; more on that later. I'll begin by saying that Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo was very good and I enjoyed his take on the character. I also enjoyed the return of Gandalf and Gollum, as they were some of the strongest characters from the previous trilogy. Indeed, there were some very beautiful shots in this film and I think the charm of the Shire still exists as it did in Fellowship of the Ring (which happens to be one of my favorite movies ever). I also enjoyed the fact that Jackson delved into the appendices to flesh out the story a bit. I am a Tolkien fan, so I can respect adding some details that many found boring or unneeded. In addition I didn't have a huge problem with the Pale Orc becoming the major protagonist. I get why he did it, making more conflict in the story, and I don't think it betrayed Tolkien by expanding his role in the film. In addition, unlike many, I didn't feel too terribly bored at the long, drawn out introduction to The Hobbit and the music is once again outstanding. HOWEVER, most of these pros are overshadowed by a host of problems, that I think, could have been avoided if the proper channels were taken. Even with Jackson's use of the appendices, I think it was a mistake to make this story a trilogy. My first gripe on this is the fact the movie is almost 3 hours long, yet I feel almost zero character development. It seems like in the first half hour of the first installment of LOTR there was more character development than there was in the entirety of The Hobbit. I also feel Jackson compensated for the lack of strong Aragorn-like character by trying to make Thorin just that. Maybe it's just because Armitage isn't up to Viggo M.'s standards, but I felt there was something missing from a strong LEAD role. That being said, I feel PJ could have gotten away with making two parts to the story instead of three. This leads me to my biggest gripe of all, which actually has become my biggest issue with cinema, EVER. I saw the movie in IMAX 3D HFR (Hi Frame Rate), and in short, I wish I can unsee everything that I witnessed. I've heard some praise for this newfangled way to portray film, but from what I took in, it was god-awful. Period. From the first frame to the last, I sat in awe, trying to understand WHY anyone would ever decide to film in 48 FPS compared to the normal 24. My first impression was that everyone was moving about 1.5 the normal speed, and I even looked into the projector booth to make sure everything was OK. However, this is the way HFR is presented. No instant is missed when filmed this way, so the normal-looking motion blur which we have all become accustomed to- and is actually MORE realistic looking (imagine that)- is not there. Along with this seemingly quicker-paced imagery, is the dreaded ""soap opera effect"" which many new HDTVs come equipped with these days, sometimes called ""Smooth Motion"", etc.. In short, it makes a multi-million dollar movie look cheap. Albeit, the landscapes are beautiful and crisp, it does absolutely no justice to the special effects or really any of the work they put into set design. Things look fake and odd; throughout the entire film I couldn't shake the idea that something was wrong. In some scenes I felt like I was watching a daytime television show and in others I felt like I was watching a video game-specifically the beginning Smaug sequence and later, the scene with the trolls. In addition, many scenes just looked tacky using the HFR technique. When Radagast is running from the Orcs on his bunny-sled on the plains, it looked horrible. Simply horrible. It really frustrated me and I wish I could take it back and see the 2D or regular frame rate 3D version. Instead, the HFR version was distracting and it made it hard for me to like the movie because I was so preoccupied with the odd visuals I was receiving on screen. It's fair to say that the HFR even clouded my judgment on the movie. I do believe I would have rated this movie higher if I had seen the other versions but I was so annoyed by the end of it that I simply couldn't rate it higher. I do plan to return and see the 24 frame rate versions to get a second opinion. Apparently, according to Jackson and James Cameron, this is the future of cinema. Due to the negative critical reviews this film has received I HOPE they can take back their claims and revert to the normalcy of 24 FPS for the future. If not, I sure hope they stand alone in their opinions, because if it is the future of film, I may never see a movie in the theaters again."

","Had rewarding day with my dad as we went to see The Hobbit together. We were not the only father and son team at the 11am morning show on Boxing day!<br/><br/>The Hobbit was truly wonderful, and I proclaim all negative reviews null and void! It was like a good dinner, where you have multiple courses, served over a long period of time, making you think you must be full while still wanting more as the hours passed.<br/><br/>The 3D and frame rate did nothing but enhance the movie, creating a truly unique movie experience. There was nothing about this movie that I would have changed, beside hoping for even longer version on DVD later. If I were to really try hard to find something wrong (while not wanting to change it), it might have been to many money shots referring to the LOTR. <br/><br/>One of the greatest thing about this movie is that it keeps the adventures spirit that you felt in LOTR, while still maintaining its uniqueness. I feel blessed having seen this movie - and for having shared it with my dad!"
"kylelillie","8","4","14","20 December 2012"," ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" comes across precisely as it means to.
","The Hobbit is a bit of a chimera. It's a little bit Lord of the Rings, as it should be as it covers events leading up to that story, and its a little bit light-hearted adventure through middle-earth. Now, no one can criticize a chimera for not being a lion or for being a dragon, when it is made up of parts of each by nature. It's identity is found in the diverse mixture of themes and events. The book is very similar in this regard, and the movie is quite close to the book. It should also be noted that unlike other movie trilogies, The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey isn't a self-contained story; we really need to see all three movies to understand all the events from An Unexpected Journey. <br/><br/>The main flaw I found in this film was the preference for action over character development. It would have been nice to see Bilbo be more of a burden and complainer than was shown in the movie. Those wide-view aerial shots sometimes came across as a cheap way to move characters from A to B.<br/><br/>The Hobbit isn't the perfect book, and it doesn't make for a ground- breaking movie either. It is not another ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. The Hobbit is a movie about Bilbo Baggins and Middle-Earth. And that's what people love about it. If you go in expecting to see any other movie than The Hobbit, you'll be disappointed."
"thewillt08","7","4","14","19 December 2012"," Not Lord of The Rings, but Who Cares Still Amazing
","Every great story has a beginning. That is what The Hobbit is to The Lord of The Rings. Before I actually start I want to acknowledge that a lot of critics are very hard on this movie. People need to realize that this is the beginning of three movies and the next two are sure to be a lot better but this isn't Lord of The Rings, it is a completely different story with a completely different goal. The book itself was made for kids and the movie is very by the book, and that is not a bad thing. I watched this movie and did not compare it because there is no comparison. As A huge fan of the series I could not do that. It is a separate movie from the others and should be viewed as an individual trilogy. The story for the Hobbit is one of revenge and adventure. Bilbo Baggins is a simple hobbit who lives in the Shire but one day is visited by the wizard, Gandalf who offers to go on an adventure. After a night with 13 dwarfs and the wizard himself Bilbo sets off the help the dwarfs reclaim their lost land of Erebor on the Lonely Mountain. Years before the dwarf city had struck a mine of gold in their city and it was attacked by the Dragon Smaug. It was overrun and for generations the dwarf kings have tried to get it back. Is this movie perfect, no but it wasn't as bad as people say. Radagast the Brown is the Hermit of Middle-Earth and has taken a lot of the brunt of the pickiness of this movie. I think he served his purpose and was fine in the movie as he was. The thirteen dwarfs are forgettable but they aren't all supposed to be relatable. The audience isn't supposed to remember all of them; they are just part of the story. You are supposed to connect with Thorin Oakenshield, Balin, and the two brothers, maybe even the really fat one. The rest are just fillers for the story and provide muscle and even comic relief. The beginning was a little slow and even a little boring and that made it a little tough to get into the world of Middle-Earth once again. At times I didn't feel like I was in Middle-Earth. There was a lot of CGI where as in the original trilogy there were extras in costume instead of CGI goblins. It was a little disappointing and some scenes were pointless. I could have done without the boxing mountains. I understand it was part of the book and Peter Jackson wanted it to be as much like the book as possible but there should be a limit. People also say the movie was too long. To that I say absolutely not. People were saying scenes should have been left out for the extended addition. Why wait? Put it all in one and save me some money later. My major problem was that I saw basically everything I was looking forward to so now I'm not as excited for the other two. That isn't really a problem as much as its me just being stupid. Also, I didn't like how Bilbo found the ring. In fellowship it seemed like the ring left Gollum while as in the Hobbit Bilbo found it by pure chance. Small things so let's talk about the positives. Middle-Earth itself looked amazing. The atmosphere was there, Middle- Earth was back once I felt like I was there. I loved seeing the three trolls and paying attention to how close it resembled the book. The wargs looked great. Gandalf didn't look ten years older and the character of Bilbo was very believable and relatable. The dwarfs were entertaining and the entire movie itself had a funny side to it. I found myself chuckling at times and it was a lighter side to the story I enjoyed. The little things made me really enjoy the movie. Especially seeing old characters even as cameos. I loved seeing Frodo, old Bilbo, Saruman, Galadrial, Elrond, and of course, Gollum. My favorite scene was with Gandalf, Elrond, Saruman, and Galadrial talking about the Necromancer and the morgal blade. It had so much information and foreshadow for the next two movies and the three that have already been made. The Necromancer is obviously going to be Sauron and Gandalf knows that there is a greater evil at work in Middle-Earth. It was odd seeing Saruman on the good side once again but it shows a lot of his character. It was also strange seeing Elrond and Galadrial speak as if nothing was wrong. Every time we saw them before they were talking about the end of the world and the destruction of men. Now they are happy and it's just a side I laughed at. Their so naive and it all changes just sixty years later. The Hobbit connected so much with the Lord of The Rings and even though it has its flaws it was still very enjoyable. Overall, this movie is not, and was not supposed to be, as good as the other three but it was still very good. Go see this movie if you were a fan of the original three. This movie was made for the die-hard fans like me. You have to know a lot about the story and Middle-Earth to enjoy the full experience. Maybe that is why critics did not enjoy the film as much as anticipated. This movie is doomed to comparison and for that it will not really be remembered as a classic or one of the best like Lord of The Rings. It will make a lot of money but will only be remembered by the true fans of Tolkien. I give The Hobbit the WillyT Honorable Mention because it had some obvious flaws, but I will surely buy it on Blu-Ray and enjoy it again and again."
"simonjlbutler","6","4","14","18 December 2012"," OK but needed a stronger editor
","On the plus side my 8yr old and 11yr old absolutely loved it. 11yr old said it was better than Harry P, which is praise indeed as he is an HP nut. For me as a 40-something Tolkien and PJ fan (who loved the LOTR films) I think the critics have it about right. <br/><br/>Much of the vitriol directed against the critics by the PJ fan club seems to lack any kind of objectivity. Falling along the lines of ""the critics don't know what they are talking about"" or ""they are jumping on the band wagon"" etc. Many of the critical reviews I have read are actually quite considered pieces of journalism. <br/><br/>For me it was 3 out of 5. The riddle scene was fantastic cinema/theatre - Serkis was amazing. Throughout I thought Freeman did a much better job than I expected (I always felt he was too ""knowing"" an actor to play Bilbo with the right amount of naivety but he proved me wrong). <br/><br/>However the first half or so of the film suffered from dreadful pacing, the scenes at Bag End dragged forever. I was not the only Dad in the auditorium looking at his watch. For me Azog was an unnecessary distraction seemingly designed to lift the film from a younger children's adventure to appeal to the impressionable and immature teen market and at the same time somehow recreate the threat of the chase that the Black Riders delivered in LOTR . On many levels PJ seemed to be trying to create a LOTR-lite rather than The Hobbit.<br/><br/>The CGI was obviously CGI and at times it was like watching a computer game, which made trying to engage on an emotional level quite difficult. The Goblin King looked like he had walked out of a Muppets Christmas special. Why oh why did they not stick to using real actors for the Orcs/goblins? The ones in LOTR were much more realistic / believable and therefore terrifying than the CGI versions in AUJ (any defence that it was not to scare the children is undermined by the inclusion of a character as repellent as Azog).<br/><br/>**SPOILER** The ""fall"" of Thorin at the end was a very contrived and unsubtle attempt to try and elicit a similar sort of emotional response from the audience that we saw in LOTR when Gandalf fell in Moria. It did not work for me, partly because Thorin's character was not as established as Gandalf's and partly because such a manufactured piece of audience manipulation left me cold. <br/><br/>It did have its moments and all in all I would say it was ""ok"". Would have benefited from a stronger editor. But my boys loved it, so what do I know."
"ramair350","9","4","14","17 December 2012"," Overall excellent - I would almost think perfect if LOTR hadn't already set the bar
","I loved this movie. The sets are amazing. The CGI is unbelievably believable. The acting is very good, with an excellent Gollum performance (as expected). The beauty of the film is worth watching alone (and by the way, I saw it in 3D / 48 frames per second and loved it ... my wife and mother also thought it looked awesome, and none of us had any motion sickness issues whatsoever).<br/><br/>The two ""gripes"" I have about the movie: #1 - I feel like they crammed 90 minutes of content into a 170 minute movie. I really do believe that the film should have been two parts instead of three, and some of the sequences felt like some editing was in order. And I'm someone who absolutely loved the extended edition Lord of the Rings movies, because they really added missing pieces to the story. But for The Hobbit, which I am sure I will want to own, I would almost be hoping they have a ""Hobbit size"" edition that trims things down.<br/><br/>#2 - The bar was set sky high with the Lord of the Rings movies (which are my favorite films of all-time). Of course you will compare the movies, and it is nearly impossible to top those movies. The storyline is grander, the locations more numerous and menacing, the characters more complex, and evil in LOTR is just not at the same level in The Hobbit, which is consistent with the books. It is a shame that The Hobbit was not made first, and then followed by LOTR, but regardless both series of movies will stand the test of time and be regarded as classics.<br/><br/>In summary, The Hobbit is a fantastic film. Just watch it and appreciate it for what it is, and don't expect it to outshine LOTR. It is absolutely a must-see at the theater.<br/><br/>EDIT 12/20/12 - Wow, I'm getting less than 50% helpful ratings on the review - really? Was this just poorly written and had no useful information? Depressing. I hope this info is actually useful to most of you, despite the ""no"" clickers :-)"

"Prichards12345","6","4","14","16 December 2012"," Mostly effective and enjoyable but with some large flaws.
","Some of the reviews by professional critics have called The Hobbit overblown and bloated. YES it is long. Yes, perhaps cutting 30 minutes of extraneous material (saving more for a future possible extended edition) would have made a better film; but to me The Hobbit was a reasonably absorbing and gently humorous movie which occasionally becomes breath-taking. I saw this in 2D, so I've no idea what the HFR version is like.<br/><br/>Jackson still manages to bring some deep feeling to the material - usually when he has Gandalf (Ian McKellen, splendid as ever) utter some words of wisdom, but this is a lighter shade of Middle-Earth compared to the original Lord Of The Rings movies, just occasionally veering towards darkness. It's perhaps a little unfortunate that the appendices material - the stuff not in the original book - is sledgehammered into the narrative, often slowing the action down. There's little doubt that occasionally the movie crawls.<br/><br/>PJ has sort of reversed his approach here from Lord Of The Rings; there he had to cut huge wedges of the books out of the trilogy to keep the running time down;here he has to expand the story and beat it to death to get to the 169 minute running time.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is a superb Bilbo Baggins, but I also found Richard Armitidge's Thorin, James Nesbitt's Bofur and Ken Stott's Balin made good contributions to the movie - the rest of the dwarfs hardly registered with me. The returning Rings characters, Elrond, Frodo, Galadriel and Saruman feel like a bit of window dressing to be honest; but who's complaining when Kate Blanchett looks as utterly gorgeous as she does in this movie! Prepare for Jackson's trademark swooping camera, Middle-Earth vistas a plenty, a nicely judged turn from Sylvester McCoy as Radagast the Brown, whose character nonetheless feels somewhat out of place, and a moment of darkness as the Necromancer shows up. Smaug is used as a teaser for the upcoming films.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film's best moments come when Bilbo finally meets Gollum, in what I think will prove to be a classic scene. Tolkien's text is here rendered extremely faithfully. The only sequence that didn't really work for me was the battling rock giants. What the hell was that all about? A short sentence from the book is turned into a jarring sequence that also seems out of place. However this was an OK start to the new trilogy; it did not improve."
"cdaaleonard2526","8","4","14","15 December 2012"," Good, but different
","Overall I thought the movie was good, but it didn't have that LOTR feel to it, which is what makes LOTR, well LOTR.<br/><br/>I felt the switch to CGI orcs was bad, they felt fake to me and I did not feel like I was watching a LOTR movie. They should have stuck to the orcs, consisted of prosthesis and real actors like the first 3 films.<br/><br/>Also, the key flaw to this movie is that there is no lead character you can cling onto, it seemed like it was Thorin, who came over as this trilogy's Aragorn to me, but I just did not feel like it was LOTResque. I don't really know how to describe it but I never felt like i was watching a LOTR film. In the first three films there is the whole atmosphere surrounding the characters that is so emotional and heavy and that is why the first three films were so amazing. Also, going along with my latest point, there wasn't any really emotional music pieces, the only one was the ""misty mountain"" one in the shire, and I really enjoyed that part, it felt like LOTR to me. But for example in the Fellowship my favorite parts are the piece right after Gandalf dies and when Frodo asks Aragorn, ""Would you destroy it?"" in Amen-Hen because you can hear Sauron speaking to Aragorn, but Aragorn isn't tempted and closes Frodo's hand and says ""I would have gone with you to the end, into the very fires of Mordor."" And that showed what kind of a character Aragorn was, but in AUJ you don't have those touching scenes that define the characters, excpet when Bilbo decides not to kill Gollum, and that part really stood out to me. So basically what I'm saying is that no character stood out to me and they all kind of blended together, unlike the first three films."

","I had my doubts whether Peter Jackson would be a ""three-hit wonder"", but after watching the Hobbit the day it premiered, I couldn't be more wrong. The story started out slow, gathering momentum. Jackson did some smart moves by purposely not letting us see how the dragon looks like for suspense. After rewatching LOTR, I realised how much effort Jackson made in ensuring continuity. For example, did you know that Frodo and Bilbo were wearing the exact same clothes in LOTR? I mean, nobody would noticed if they did not, but he made them wear it anyway. This shows how good a director Jackson is. In fact, the movie is so good that I watched it twice. I feel that more emphasis should be given on each dwarf, besides the 3 goodlooking ones (Thorin, Kili, Fili), as I can't really differentiate between them. Also, Gandalf exists as a mere deux ex machina to save the day. My favourite moments would be their ""roller-coaster"" like battles with Azog (jumping from tree to tree) and trapped below ground. Misfortune seems to find them all the time. Also, I especially liked the riddles between Gollum and Bilbo. The most important thing of the movie is it is much more thrilling with 3D and is funnier than LOTR. This movie also taught me some pretty important quotes. Gandalf said, ""Saruman believes it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. I found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay... small acts of kindness and love."" This practically goes against all the banal Disney superhero tripe that someone ""Superman/Batman"" always saves the day, but they don't realise that crap wouldn't happen if the citizens weren't so messed up anyway. All in all, the movie is very exciting and sometimes scary, but the story is deep with beautiful words and ideology."

I loved Martin Freeman as Bilbo I'd say the casting was perfect and everyone fit in perfectly well. Gandalf was amazing as always and our savior in every movie. Thorin was amazing and I was almost down to tears when he was almost dead. Gollum was by far the best character in the movie and I screamed my lungs out when I saw him on the screen. Additional appearances like Elrond and Saruman were amazing as I got goosebumps. The 48 frames per rate made a few scenes look a bit like the ""fast-forward"" mode.

"sosvovenon","3","4","15","28 December 2012"," A Poor Film
","First of all, let me give you a short anecdote of what happened to me while I was watching this movie in the theater.<br/><br/>At first, after putting on my 3D glasses, the opening credits looked as though I was staring cross-eyed at some sickening troll picture on the internet. I really started feeling a little bit uneasy, and frankly -- sick to the stomach. Next, I started to adjust a tiny bit to the 3D. The audio was just on the verge of being ear-splitting at times, adding to my discomfort. Then, the frame rate hit in. A few parts of the scenes in the first 45 or so minutes looked like a ridiculous silent movie from the 1920's. To me, the action scenes consisted of up to 80% of inexplicable confused ghost closeups of something that I suppose was dwarfs being double projected onto my retinas. This also filled my body up with an emotion that can only be described as mild to moderate angst. <br/><br/>In one scene a loud snoring sound appeared, panned far to the right. This was when I was just aching for the movie to end. My hind quarters were hurting pretty bad. I thought that a member of the audience had actually fallen asleep, which wouldn't have surprised me in the least by that point. But it turned out to be just one of the goblins snoring! Great unintentional humor there! I would like to address Mr. Jackson directly now. I want to tell you that watching this movie was a rather excruciating experience. I got quite physically nauseated by the horridness of the 3D effects that I experienced, and the sometimes inexplicable effects of the high frame rate. I don't go to the movies to feel physically and mentally anguished. I would very much like it if you payed me an amount of money that represents what it cost my mother to actually take me to your movie just to cement our family relations during the important ""mellandagarna"" Holiday in Sweden, plus a sum that represents a decent wage for three hours of work in your country. The money for the ticket will be used to reimburse my mother for her expense. The rest of the money will go to me personally to compensate for my loss of time while watching your film. Bear in mind Mr. Jackson -- the above is not (except for a couple of somewhat bitter comments) my opinion of your film, or a review of it. Its what actually happened to me while the film was being shown in the theater. If you would like to the decent and humane thing, please PM me on IMDb!<br/><br/>Now we come to that difficult and sad part when I have to review this movie. It is tempting to make this the ""best of"" compilation of the already excellent dumps several people have taken on this film, at this site. But I must rake my brain and make a (somewhat) original submit. (After all we all had to sit through the same film). Regrettably, it has to begin with the characters. Radagast: An embarrassing role that has bird manure caked in his beard. I cringed inside every time I was exposed to this poor representation of the brown wizard, which was actually a welcome relief from the nausea from the 3D. Galadriel: What can I say. Cate Blanchett is a good actress, but in this rendition of her previous part she provokes in me a slight feeling of wanting to get up from your movie seat and leave. Maybe its the way she turns so dreamily... Gandalf: Just bland. The Dwarfs: oh my Goodness... That (those) was (were)(some)(an) embarrassing performance(s)! Someone wrote that they reminded them of Jar-Jar Binks from the first Star Wars prequel. That is so spot on! Elrond: One of the few redeeming interpretations, but the part when they circle around the dwarfs with the horses sent messages to my legs to just get up and walk out of the theater. Bilbo: yeah... Real interesting. The rest of the characters: I hardly remember them because of the lingering nausea. (On a side-note: the reason this film gets a 3 from me and not a 1 is the fact that the beginning description of the Lonely Mountain and Thorin's acceptance of Bilbo actually provoked something slightly resembling true pangs of emotion in me). The Script: Obviously created by the same Peter Jackson Splinter Mind that wrote the ""Deadmen Nuke"" part of ""Return of the King"". Really liked the snot humor, and so on! Nearly wet my pants spilling my drink on my pants to get out of the theater there, with a valid excuse for leaving (I wet my pants). I'm not even going to describe the rest of my feelings for this film. All I'm going to say is this: In 2014 get ready for ""Attack of the Clone Wars: The Quickening, part 2: Bilbo goes through a forest to a mountain, and that will take 6 hours!!!!"""

","for me not many movies deserves an applause. hobbit is one movie which lingers in my heart for so long. as far as i know a cinematic masterpiece has a range which cannot be reached by ordinary blockbuster even if they are good. eg-inception is a good(or great?) movie but it fails to become a masterpiece. but lord of the rings movies are pure cinematic jewels. these movie have set a standard which cannot be reached by any other.<br/><br/>coming back to hobbit. this movie is an art in a different sense. i thought before that a movie with comedy in it cannot be a masterpiece. but i have never been so wrong before. hobbit is both light hearted,funny and also at the same time serious. its a bold mix(comedy and seriousness) which many movies have tried before but failed miserably or just become a good movie. but a masterpiece? it takes a movie like hobbit to fulfill it.<br/><br/>all the movies which i consider a masterpiece(apocalypse now,lotr,godfather,iruvar,hey ram)just focus on its story and has a serious tone to it throughout. even hobbit focuses on its story but the movie feels not so serious as others. its a peculiar thing i have never seen in any other movie. its both funny and serious and kind hearted. i cant describe the feel it gives me.<br/><br/>that said, this movie has action,great visuals,good amount of emotion and comedy,a serious plot,great actors,good direction,and everything else associated with this movie is either good or great. screenplay may be a bit of lag to someone but its absolutely necessary. as said in the movie a good story needs embellishment."
"Dannov747","5","4","15","23 December 2012"," Too long for a short plot. Should have been one movie.
","I didn't really follow the development news about this film - The Lord of the Rings trilogy largely satisfied my lotr fandom. So I was most surprised when my friend informed me that the this was only part one of three adaptations of the Hobbit. That confused me, wasn't The Hobbit a relatively short book, with a rather simple plot? Such things can either be thought of as money grabbing or fan service. I think it depends on the product, splitting the final book worked for Harry Potter after all.<br/><br/>But in the end, the Hobbit's main problem was the lack of plot development throughout the movie. The film instead mainly relied on dialog and drawn out scenes to fill in its 2 and a half hours. True, the scenery and special effects are brilliant, and the dialog quite clever and witty, but there just wasn't enough story. I firmly believe that as a one film adaption the Hobbit would have been much better."

","Approached out of the blue by Gandalf, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin. Their journey takes them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. <br/><br/>Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. <br/><br/>Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities.....<br/><br/>It's beautiful to look at, Jackson throws us right back into Tolkiens world with ease, and it's like meeting up with old friends again, albeit, apart from a few, the old friends are hugely different. Wood seems way out of place in this movie, and it's quite a feat to believe this, as he was the central character from the original trilogy.<br/><br/>And the biggest problem this movie has is the exposition. You think the farewells dragged at the end of ROTK? This really takes the biscuit. Although the performances are fantastic, and Freeman makes a star turning performance, the first hour drags and drags to the point of boredom.<br/><br/>But as soon as we meet Lee, Weaving, And Blanchett once more, the film excels into the fantastical world we all know and love. By all means, the first hour does have some good set pieces, the meeting of the Necromancer for one, but compared to the second half, it just drags.<br/><br/>The rock monster fight, the escape from the Trolls, and the final showdown with the pale Orc, are phenomenal cinema, and really captivate the audience.<br/><br/>But the most powerful sequence is the introduction of Gollum. You think he was intense in the trilogy, he is amazing in this. Serkis steals the thunder from everyone in his scenes with Freeman. The scene is full of emotion and intensity, and for once, it's very easy to sympathise with the creature, as this shows Bilbo as nothing more than a thief.<br/><br/>It's powerful scenes like this that make the movie so great, but Jacksons downfall is all in the exposition , which really stops the movie from being what it should be, a true classic.<br/><br/>It's still very good though."
"yasenkiranov","6","4","15","15 December 2012"," Flawed,but not that bad
","I went to see ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" yesterday.It is one of the most anticipated movies of 2012 and when it finally came out,there was a major difference between the user and critic rating,probably the biggest I have seen on the IMDb.This made me even more curious to see what the movie was like.<br/><br/>To be completely honest,the movie didn't disappoint me,but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.I haven't read Mr.Tolkien's book,so I don't know how well the movie follows it,but in terms of story it was alright,although there are several things that weren't really explained,but hopefully they will be clarified in the later movies.The film,however,has several fatal flaws,that ruin the overall experience:<br/><br/>1.Too many characters.If you remember,the fellowship of the ring consisted of 9 characters :Frodo,Gandalf,Legolas,Gimley,Aragorn,Boromir,Sam and the other two hobbits.Gimley,the dwarf,was there manly to provide comedic relief.If there is one character like that-it's okay.Now imagine a company of 14 people,well,a hobbit,dwarfs and a wizard,if you want to be precise,and eleven of them are Gimley like characters.You just can't take it seriously with someone constantly falling,belching,breaking chairs,due to their excessive weight and so on,and so on.<br/><br/>2.References to modern things,that you will never,ever see in a film like this.I think ""Aladdin"" started this trend and sure,back then it was fun,but now it's just plain annoying.Plus,I never,in a million years expected to see this in a Peter Jackson movie,or any movie connected to ""The Lord of The Rings"" franchise"" for that matter.<br/><br/>3.A very,very stupid beginning.I promise you,in the first 30 minutes of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" you will not be able to take the movie seriously,no matter how hard you try.The whole part is just so over-the-top and cheesy,did they get a different director for that segment,because no sane individual,unless he was under the effect of hallucinogenic substances,could approve of something like this.What were they thinking???<br/><br/>Despite all it's flaws,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" has a charm to it.You know the movie is flawed,but you just can't bring yourself to hate it.To the film's credit,it actually gets pretty good in the final 20 minutes.From the game of riddles scene to the very end,the movie is a non-stop pleasure cruise."
"Isaiah4031forever","4","4","15","15 December 2012"," A true but maybe slightly to critical review
","The hobbit<br/><br/>while I originally was going to not see the film at all due to the ridiculousness of making a small book into three movies (can anyone say sell out?), a free ticket came my way. I enjoyed watching the film in an almost entirely empty theater on opening weekend but mostly because I made jokes with my brothers throughout it. The first three fourths of the film were slowÂ… Very slow. And mostly were made up of voice-overs after voice-overs And so on. I wondered how they were going to make the movies last so long, apparently there technique was to just read the book while actors fought in the background. It would have been better if they used more of the actual lines from the book, as the lines that weren't written by Tolkien were ""follow your nose"" quality. The movie had highlights, there were 10 minutes of the film that were spectacular (Gollum!) the problem is it was a three hour movie. it did have a dramatic arc unlike I feared but In the end it was still only one third of a movie that I'm going to have to wait a year to see the rest. It would've been a great miniseries and waiting a week between the episodes would've been fine. With that said the main actor did wonderful, and if they would have let him use more of his stellar comedic timing he could have done for this movie what Robert Downey Junior did for Iron Man, but the movie was too busy trying to look epic to be enjoyable. The flaws in The Lord of the Rings that were only slight irritations made this movie drag. Someone needs to teach Peter Jackson the word ""Cut"", and this film almost had as many beginnings as, Return of the King had endings. However despite being marred with sensationalism of the Indiana Jones and the crystal skull type action, the ending was well done and almost wiped the first two hours of boredom from my memory. However if you don't look at the... (well not movie more like...) episode holistically, and rate it only by its highlights, it had lots to love. I'd watch it in the comfort of your own home, so you can do other things while you watch for the good parts, and I'd really wait three years so you can finish the movie. Just my thoughts from a Lord of the Rings fan"
"Argemaluco","8","4","15","15 December 2012"," Imperfect but very entertaining
","I found The Lord of the Rings cinematographic trilogy an extraordinary adaptation of essential novels from fantastic genre. After that, director Peter Jackson made the excellent remake of King Kong and the tedious The Lovely Bones, which was completely lacking of any emotion and narrative force. Fortunately, Jackson redeems himself with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, a very entertaining epic film...even though not lacking of some insipid passages and more characters than the necessary.<br/><br/>The screenplay of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is chronologically set 60 years before The Lord of the Rings, and as a consequence, it doesn't follow the same characters from that trilogy. Some of them have brief cameos, but we won't find the same dynamic between races nor the balance of heroic archetypes. And the 13 ""leading"" dwarfs are peripheral figures, reduced to their most basic identity trait: the fat one, the funny one, etc. The only exception is Thorin...pity that his personality doesn't go beyond his superficial function. For better or for worse, the ""Company of Dwarfs"" are extras in their own story (so far). On the other hand, this lets Ian McKellen and the great Martin Freeman carry with the dramatic weight of the film, and they are both completely credible in their roles while having a perfect chemistry with each other.<br/><br/>Then, we have Jackson's solid direction, which competently balances the personal drama with the visual spectacle. The special effects widely surpass the ones of The Lord of the Rings trilogy (naturally, the studio Weta had almost 10 years in order to improve their technology), but I occasionally kinda missed the employment of more practical effects, specially regarding creatures and enemies. On some moments, I felt the action scenes exceeded the requirements of the story and crossed to the ""see what we can do now"" field. On the positive side, Jackson shows a precise control over the tone and atmosphere, orchestrating light ""comic relief"" scenes without decreasing gravity to the serious moments of introspection and personal growth.<br/><br/>I'm now going to invest some time in writing about the controversial system of 48 frames per second employed in the shooting and exhibition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Against my custom, I decided to watch this film on ""HFR 3D"", and I have to admit that the quality of image was phenomenal, much better than any other thing I have ever watched on a big screen. On the other hand, I keep disliking the 3D, because I think it darkens the image and overshadows the colours. However, regarding the HD system at 48 frames per second...I'm totally convinced. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I didn't like The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey as much as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I think it made a very good work at introducing us to another facet of Middle Earth. So, I can definitely recommend it as a very solid and entertaining film. Having said that, when will Jackson make the ""independent horror film"" he has been promising for years? I like the fantasy, but I want to see him back to the territory of Bad Taste and Dead Alive as soon as possible."
"TKDLion8","9","4","15","15 December 2012"," I had my doubts, but it was surprisingly great!
","I kept up with all of the news and production videos leading up to this movie. I had my doubts about how this movie would turn out. Peter Jackson did change the time-line a little and a few of the events were altered also. But all in all, the movie was very enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>Many people put a lot of stock in visuals. But visuals by themselves don't make a movie good, at least not in my book. Having said that, the visuals were awesome; they're even better than the ones in LOTR. Erebor looks AMAZING! Now for what I didn't like. The White Council scene. Many people have protested it's inclusion in this movie. I didn't mind the idea of having the scene, but I didn't like the execution. I know that Saruman is technically the head of the order of wizards but what kind of hierarchy do they really have? Gandalf seems like a school child getting a reprimand. I also wasn't impressed by the score. It feels like it was recycled from LOTR. While I liked the LOTR score a lot, I would have liked a more different score for the Hobbit. Another thing I didn't like was that Bilbo seems to do almost everything. Instead of Gandalf mimicking the Troll voices, Bilbo stalls them instead. And Bilbo actually saves Thorin in a fight with Azog. It just doesn't gel with the Bilbo I know from the book.<br/><br/>The best things in the movie are Erebor, Orcrist, Bag End, and the Misty Mountains song. Elrond's armor was also pretty cool.<br/><br/>Several people have complained about the pacing, but I thought that it was just right. Then again I do have a longer attention span than most people."
"Staffenburgen","7","4","15","15 December 2012"," It's good, just good
","I went into Peter Jackson's latest Lord of the Rings adaptation with mixed expectations (as I imagine everybody else did). On one hand, Jackson fans have been praising the film for its excellence, while the critics have been giving it lukewarm reviews at best. For me, the film felt like a balancing act; it tries to be light-hearted and serious simultaneously, and at times it comes close to falling, but all in all, the film holds up nicely.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the previous Lord of the Rings films, the first thing to note is that ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is not in the same vein as the other instalments; the tone is much lighter, and the humour is more frequent, yet at the same time, the film has a dark edge. Fans of the book may be disappointed, since the mood of the book is definitely different than Tolkien's version. In addition to that, many sections of the movie are completely absent from the novel. Some of the extra segments are completely made up, but from what I understand, many of the extra scenes are from an Appendix in The Return of the King, although I can't say I understood why they were necessary additions to the movie. <br/><br/>Differences from the book aside, the story is very enjoyable. It begins with a bit of back-story, explaining how Smaug came to take over Erebor, before shifting focus towards Bilbo in the Shire. The film takes its time getting started, and doesn't shy away from developing the central characters, which I thoroughly enjoyed. As the classic scenes from the book played out on screen, I found myself smiling, most of the time. I really only had one complaint; in general, I felt like many of the best scenes were dramatized just a little bit too much. This is probably the result of a 300 page book being stretched into nine hours of film, but I definitely felt like the extra flair detracted from the story.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman does a great job with the lead role, particularly in the earlier parts of the film. In addition, I also enjoyed Gandalf and Thorin. Most of the other dwarfs don't really add much to the film, although that aspect of the film mirrors the book, so I suppose I can't really complain. Also worthy of mention is Gollum, who shines (not literally) in his parts and is brilliantly acted by Andy Serkis. <br/><br/>As expected, the film features some truly magnificent scenery. Many scenes in the film feature spectacular sights, and as a whole, the movie is incredibly engaging. Jackson is master of immersing the viewer completely in his world, and this ability is fully utilized here. As far as the 48 fps hype, I can honestly say I didn't notice any difference between this movie and any other movie I've seen recently, but that certainly doesn't detract from the film's beauty.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a good film. I wouldn't call it great, nor would I call it terrible; it's just good. Looking forward, I am eager to see the next two instalments, and will definitely be standing in line on opening night for both of them.<br/><br/>RATING: 6.5/10"
"JoeBobJones","8","4","15","15 December 2012"," Score! Thief! Music! Baggins!
","I am a fan boy. The LOTR films are my favorite film collections of all time, including The Godfather. That said, while watching The Hobbit today on opening day, I realized how drastically important the score is to these films. Chiming back to the LOTR, the score truly drew the viewer into the heart of the film. It was the third leg of the joy and success of it, the other two being cinematography and script/acting. Now I am not complaining that this is not a copy of the Fellowship of the Ring, nor was that was I was hoping to see. The Hobbit, on the other hand, is a rather cold rendition, a rote calling in of story and plot, brutally hindered by a musical score which serves to do nothing but act as background. Howard Shore may have been under orders, or a defiant desire to create a brand new piece with little relation to LOTR musically. This musical departure was like a knife in the dark, or a shot from left field. Imagine seeing Jaws without the essential soundtrack, or Close Encounters, or Star Wars for that matter. Granted, it is a sadly focused complaint to only bitch about the score, but I'M SERIOUS, it derailed the love for The Hobbit. There were normal Jackson-esque liberties with the story, such as a completely different circumstance of Bilbo actually finding the ring (I assumed this might support Gandalf's suspicions of finding the ring in the next two films, but Jackson did lay it out in the Fellowship backstory quite clearly...) The Dwarfs are excellent, beautifully cast, and less slapstick than the book lends to. In fact, The Hobbit is much darker than the book, although there are moments of absurdity and even stooge camp. It's fun, but it is largely dialed in, dark, and seems like the first leg in an action trio instead of the first film you want to grow to love the characters and story with. Perhaps the director change from Del Toro to Jackson actually resulted into a dialed in film. There isn't much heart, but there are great action scenes. The best big bad guy of the past 20 years, the Great Goblin (Barry Humphries), is my new favorite. His quivering jowl is impossible to look away from, except his eye and expression steal the movie. We are left at a convenient spot for film 2. Jackson is going to have to work some major magic wonder in the second film to make up for the rather mundane first. The next two films, in total package, need to be better. Sorry, Pete."
"anirudh-bhatnagar","6","4","15","15 December 2012"," Watch for Nostalgia!
","Catched the late night show of Hobbit, an unexpected journey last night. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the LOTR but this seemed so stretched and overlong, that a few audience members were catching up on their forty winks(well, at least one and it wasn't me. Then again, maybe it was the timing of the show)! The tone of the movie is lighter and most of the audience has knowledge of whats going to eventually happen as it is a prequel to the such famous and record breaking movies. This took away much of suspense and tension from the action sequences of the movie leading to a lack of sense of danger. The first half of the movie only feels like outtakes or deleted scenes from the trilogy and second half is where the action picks up a bit. Whats good are the lead actors and amazing production values, set deigns and visual effects including 3D though it seemed to be a bit dark after putting the 3D glasses on at my theater. Also the movie was shown in 24fps as opposed to 48fps it was shot in. The action sequences were pretty well shown though some places the CGI looked a bit strange and stood out. Watch for sense of nostalgia, if you loved the original films and obviously the awe inspiring New Zealand landscapes"
"darragh_mccabe","7","4","15","14 December 2012"," Bit of a let down
","I believe that this film did not live up to the expectations placed on it. However, it was in fact a great film. If it was a completely independent franchise i would rate it a lot higher than i have done, but due to the sheer awesomeness of The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit somehow was not as epic and/or thrilling as i originally expected. I do in fact love the storyline and i believe that it has a lot of potential to become one of the great film series' of all time. I think it is a very original film, with not a lot of others being based solely around the main characters going on a 'journey'. This, in a way, makes it somewhat unique, and this is also quite a risk taken by Peter Jackson. He has pulled it off quite spectacularly in my eyes, with the scenery and the land that the hero travels through being utterly breath- taking. I think that the way the book has been almost mirrored in the making of the film, something that is very rare in novel-based films these days, is a breath of fresh air from the majority of completely random and aggravating films that are being made. However, the things that Jackson and the rest of the film-makers did not do well at all, is character development. I felt no connection to any of the 12 dwarfs that featured in The Hobbit. If one of them were to die in the film, i seriously doubt that i would care really, which is something that i think films need. Without an emotional connection to any characters, I found the film to be boring at times, especially during the scenes that were supposed to be emotional. The only dwarf who's life and the story behind him that was explained was Thorin, and this was probably only because he is the leader of the pack. And Thorin, i believe, is not a very likable character until near the end. Another critical point i have is the amount of humour that was in the film. I felt that during the trilogy of The Lord Of The Rings, only a few moments of banter between Legolas and Gimley made me laugh, and i had no problems with this. Some people may disagree and say that more humour is better, but in such an epic and serious franchise as Lotr, i think that adding a touch of humour somewhat decreases this 'epicness'. I felt that the film was too much aimed at younger viewers, and did not stick to its roots of being a serious and action-filled title. Finally, I was disappointed by the cliffhanger ending. Not a good ending to a reasonably uneventful beginning and mid-section. However, in the Lord Of the Rings trilogy, the first and second films were both left with similar endings. Especially The Fellowship Of the Ring. The Ending to that was when Samwise and Frodo sailed away to continue their journey to Mordor and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimley went in search of Merry and Pippins orc captors. Now this is not in fact an exciting end, but the death of Boromir at least made it so that something of interest happened close to the finale. Nothing of such magnitude happened in The Hobbit, with the ending being a simple 'we shall continue our quest' finale. I am hoping that 'The Desolation of Smaug', which is the next instalment in the series, will be more dramatic, and the characters will develop a lot more, if not, then i am afraid that this trilogy will have been some what of a let down, for me anyway."
"accendant","7","4","15","14 December 2012"," New Tech opportunity missed
","Had high expectations but was disappointed. I would say there were moments of engagement with the audience at a very high level. The troll/orc camp-fire scene was superb. The new frame rate was fantastic. As for acting well the white bearded dwarf and Gandalf shined. The leader of the group acted well. But when animated characters outshine the lead role of real human actors you've gotta question casting choices. The White troll showed more emotion than many of the human actors.<br/><br/>Damn-it missed opportunity with this fantastic technology. Lighting crap, music crap (we don't need music) music seemed clearly to be a crutch used to give emotional content to uninspired acting and perhaps scripting. Depth of field the real loser. Maybe it's a new field for film makers but they are using that old school blurred background and sharp foreground technique from 2d films and photography with 3d film making. When you look at anything in the world around you there is a certain natural level of blur to the background. This should be the bare minimum to aim for I would think. But they never hit that sweet point that we are all familiar with given that we live in a 3d world. It was either too much (perhaps didn't have an epic background) or too little (very little blur to the background). It was like every shot was like ""What are you trying to do here?""<br/><br/>So many action scenes with great opportunities to involve the viewer but no we are sweep through these scenes on a smooth a glass pan shot never giving you the real feel of the scene. <br/><br/>The insistence on so many fake sets, fake lighting, it just reeked of comic book hero type garbage. They could or perhaps should of gone for a more real look.<br/><br/>Seriously Peter. You were a pioneer once. Let's see it again. If you want idea's for sound, lighting, field of depth take a good hard look at Judge Dredd 2012<br/><br/>One more thing. The Golumn. Holy s..t that actor is a genius and stole the show for me. The skitzo acting with two different characters was so amazing physically and emotionally engaging. The audience were laughing out loud at how the emotion could be portrayed so vividly and believably by this creature. A real show winning performance for Gollum.<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations were too high but other films this year have blown me away such as Judge Dredd. I expect far more."
"BeneCumb","8","3","10","4 January 2013"," Spirit of the book well captured
","Films like this have usually enthusiastic fans and gloomy skeptics - but they are not uninviting. The first do - after enjoying the book - appreciate state-of-the-art realisation, the latter are of the opinion that technology effects and tricks would decrease the importance of acting and spirit. Well, it is true that heavy make-up + digital distortions make much more difficult to evaluate real skills of an actor (most of dwarfs, trolls, orcs) and in fight/battle scenes, huge creatures would steal the show. However, those elements would enlarge the audience...<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is good and quite book-like, with several great main (Ian McKellan, Martin Freeman) and supporting (Andy Serkis, Kate Blanchett, Christopher Lee - almost 90 years old during filming!) performances. Technical solutions are also well elaborated, with the exception of perhaps the orcs chasing Radagast.<br/><br/>The most visible minus is the length - over 2,5 hours - as this film is the 1st of the trilogy only and, therefore, without a proper ending. Thus, a certain challenge for younger and older viewers, above all, but definitely better than e.g. Thor or similar comic-based films."
"Radagast23","9","3","10","1 January 2013"," Surprisingly awesome
","This is about as conflicted as it gets for me. The LOTR trilogy comprise some of the greatest movies ever made by my account, so why wouldn't I want Peter Jackson to bring us back to Tolkien's magical world? Things change, though. The Dark Knight Rises felt almost nothing like The Dark Knight, so would Jackson be able to re-engineer the magic from his previous movies? Once I found out the Hobbit was being split into 3 movies, I was pretty skeptical. After all, the source material is often referred to as a children's book, somewhat different than the epic trilogy that follows it. In the end, though, I should never have had any doubt. Jackson sculpts another excellent 3+ hour movie.<br/><br/>If you've seen any of Jackson's original trilogy, than you have a good idea what you're going to get: amazing cinematography set against a New Zealand backdrop, a thunderous score by Howard Shore and impeccable acting, all of which help bring to life an amazing fantasy world. While The Hobbit does have a familiar feel, it also has some new touches of flair. For starters, you are getting a completely new cast except for Ian McKellen. Martin Freeman does a great job as a young Bilbo, and all of the dwarfs are perfectly cast, especially Richard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield, the group leader). There is also a different and more frequent use of humor in this movie compared to the trilogy, probably because the book itself was written in a lighter tone. More serious fans might find this annoying, but it fits the story and ends up being a nice change of pace in my opinion. Another thing to mention is that this film is long. Most would expect that since it is Peter Jackson, but since it's only 1/3 of the story there are slower parts. That being said, they also pour a ton of action into the first chapter. I went in expecting to basically just see a setup film, but a ton happened and I can't wait to see it continue next December.<br/><br/>Overall, the first installment of the Hobbit is very different than the LOTR but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. The tone and feel are both different, but you're still watching a Peter Jackson movie, which means it's almost unrivaled in terms of scale and production quality. If you can handle the length, I'd say this is a must see this holiday season.<br/><br/>9/10"
"grace98","10","3","10","31 December 2012"," Go watch it and watch it in HFR--EPIC
","Well, I honestly don't know why so many people are annoyed by the movie itself and the new technology.<br/><br/>First, for the movie itself, you have to admit that it is a very good movie and you have to know that it is the first part of a trilogy. The movie does tell a good story that comes from the book, and if you really have watched the LOTR trilogy, you can definitely notice a lot of details that are giving respects to the LOTR. I'm not a big ringer, but when I saw those beautiful scenes in Shire, when old Bilbo starts with ""my dear Frodo"", and when young Bilbo saying ""I'm going on an adventure"" to Sam's dad...all old memories came to me, all those feelings that the LOTR has brought just appeared in my mind. And when Bilbo picks up the ring, I almost cried. Many people are saying ""oh, the pace is so slow"", well, I don't know what to say to them, did you feel it's so long when you are watching Titanic? This movie is telling a story that Bilbo comes out from his comfortable bag end and starts a big journey, and in my opinion, all of those scenes and lines are necessary.<br/><br/>In terms of acting and story telling, I don't want to say much because ALL OF THEM are amazing, they are doing a very good job. I guess the main line of the movie is when Gandalf tells Bilbo ""the true courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one"" later, when Bilbo has a chance to kill Gollum, he just let it go. And all those major scenes are really amazing and I really enjoyed them very much.<br/><br/>Finally, the HFR new technology. I guess like every new thing that comes at the first time, it always gets some people freaked out. But please go watch it, it doesn't ruin the movie, it's a big improvement! I watched the movie in both IMAX 3D and 3D HFR. They are different, and I actually felt more comfortable when I was watching 3D HFR because my eyes can catch the movement much easier. HFR does NOT mean slow, it means clearer! So just go watch it, if you haven't watched it in HFR, go! and if you have, go watch it again! It's epic, and I'm looking forward to seeing the second and the third part, I know they will be fantastic!"

"eatfirst","8","3","10","31 December 2012"," A slow and gentle start, but the promise of big things to come.
","Baggy, never-ending goings on, going on in Bag End, give way finally to a surprisingly sprightly adventure for such a behemoth of a movie. The tone (teetering between light kiddlesome adventure and LOTR darkness) takes a while to find its feet; the excellent cast however, hit the ground running. It's pleasing to see just how much care Jackson and team have put into giving the dwarfs a rounded and meaty set of personalities, there's nary a hint of Time Bandits silliness that could have derailed a less respectful adaptation (something that Gimli's overtly comedic turn in Return Of The King pointed worryingly to).<br/><br/>The Hobbit doesn't yet engage with the same depth of emotion that made the Fellowship such an astounding achievement from the off. With the shoehorning in of much peripheral material from the Tolkien archives there may be issues with getting the right balance of looming threat and moral imperative that LOTR had running through its heart; yet these are but early days, and it will undoubtedly take the telling of the entire saga to conclude if this trilogy can measure up to the extraordinary achievements of its predecessor.<br/><br/>I was deeply sceptical of the move to three lengthy films being wrought from such a slim source, and while I remain to be wholly convinced, this first episode has much to enjoy; and once the languorous opening act was dispensed with, felt far tighter and more event-filled than the running time would suggest.<br/><br/>A gentle tale, lovingly told, and with the grimmer and bad-assier stuff still to come, there is hope of greatness yet."
"filmguru11","9","3","10","31 December 2012"," Peter Jackson's latest is a masterpiece
","It's been nearly nine years since we last voyaged through the mystical world of middle earth. But just when we thought nothing could surpass that incredible experience, Peter Jackson decides to gift us an early Christmas present with - The Hobbit.<br/><br/>The first of a trilogy, The Hobbit manages to take the audience through a life sized journey. The new technology of filming in 48 frames per second (known as HFR) along with 3D allows for smoother, sharper, more realistic motion and special effects, visually enhancing the depth of J.R.R. Tolkein's powerfully descriptive middle earth. As the audience, you are nothing more than a tiny speck in the face of this brilliant work of art.<br/><br/>The movie begins by introducing you to the mighty dwarf kingdom of Erebor (a large fortress kingdom within the mountain), well-known for producing impeccable weaponry and armour as well as for its infinite treasures. When it is unexpectedly invaded by the vicious dragon - the antagonist of The Hobbit series - Smaug, the entire kingdom is lay to waste, treasures stolen and leaving the surviving dwarfs to find a home elsewhere. Years later, the grand wizard Gandalf along with the thirteen dwarfs of Erebor turn up unannounced at Bilbo Baggins' (a conservative hobbit and the titular protagonist) home and request him to join them on their honorable quest to reclaim their kingdom from the evil dragon Smaug. What follows is an exhilarating adventure of survival as the group encounters ghastly trolls, stone-giants, nasty goblins, ferocious orcs, giant spiders and wild brutal wolves.<br/><br/>The characters enacted by all the actors were magnificent. Martin Freeman as the doubtful reserved hobbit who rises up against all odds and transforms into a hero, was endearing in his performance. Ian McKellen as the wise wizard Gandalf was brilliant as expected. The twelve dwarfs amusingly infused the comic relief, while the leader of the dwarfs Thorin (Richard Armitage) reserved his emotions to honor, nobility, discipline and revenge. Special appearances by Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee were quite enlightening and reminiscing of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lastly, the master of 'motion capture' Andy Serkis returns as the sinister and creepy Gollum to remind audiences that it was his character that set into motion the forthcoming series of events.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's latest endeavor is nothing short of a masterpiece. His execution of the script, camera angles, performances, visual effects and music is near perfection. The grand scale of the film immerses the audience into a world that is an absolute bliss for the senses and has to be experienced to be believed."
"farhanduraiz","10","3","10","30 December 2012"," Everything that i expected it to be, and more!
","The internet is filled with negative reviews about hobbit and how Peter Jackson took it a bit too far when he decided to split the book into 3 feature length movies. I read some of those reviews and in the back of my head i did prepare myself for disappointment but still on the surface i just couldn't come to terms with The Hobbit not being a spectacle! I mean it was peter Jackson and the hobbit, how could it go wrong! And let me tell you it didn't! Ignore all the negative reviews, set aside any doubts. I cant find one reason as to why they exist in the first place. People either have lost the patience to appreciate 3 hour movies or they just don't get what peter and co were trying to accomplish here. The movie flew me by and not once it was a drag. Instead it was just an indescribable treat to revisit some familiar places and faces. On top of that discovering new aspects of the world Tolken called Middle Earth. The movie has plenty substance to be able to justify its length and what it succeeds at doing is creating a link, a bond between all the new characters. This is similar to what i felt when i watched the LOTR series. The movie mixed great graphics, story, action, acting with a loving touch of character development to end up being another glittering jewel in the LOTR saga. Those of you who enjoy LOTR for its detail, setting and story can expect to have a great time. But if you are here looking for meaningless action, special effects, kabooms, let me warn you, you're watching the wrong movie."
"Cya6","10","3","10","30 December 2012"," Loved it!
","I have to say, I really enjoyed this. Did it drag at the beginning? I didn't think so, but I can understand why some might say it did. Did it deviate from the book? Yes, but not the plot. Everything that happened was canon to the series, even if it wasn't necessarily in the Hobbit book proper. I personally loved the music, and had no objections to reusing the themes, though it wouldn't have hurt to keep the specific themes to their specific characters. The dwarfs I really liked. I get that the Hobbit is supposed to be a lighter show than LotR. I like how more developed they are than in the books, where you can even remember half their names. I've seen it twice, once in 3D and once in 2D. I enjoyed both, though the 3D was a bit distracting, it was very well done. I personally had no qualm with the pacing. TBH, I found LotR dragged more than the Hobbit. Also, loved the scenes with Gollum. I don't think anyone can complain against those, that was a GREAT scene! Hope to see it again soon!"
"WebHead62","7","3","10","28 December 2012"," Nice Trip Back to Middle Earth
","I was 15 when return of the king came out and have been waiting 9 years for Peter Jackson to take us back to Middle Earth in The Hobbit. It's finally here and it doesn't disappoint. I had my doubts when I heard that Jackson was going to make three movies out of one book. I was worried it would get kind of slow and possibly boring. It is very long and slow in some parts, but never boring. Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo and all the cast members from the lord of the rings slip back into their characters like there hasn't been a decade between movies. The best scene is between Bilbo and Gollum. I won't spoil it for those who didn't read the book or see the movie yet, but it was great. It was almost exactly like the book and that's what you hope for when there are three movies for one book. For most people it was probably too long for 1/3 of a book, but if you love lord of the rings and being immersed into that world then there can never be too much of it. The one scene they could have cut out was the rock fight. You'll know what I mean when you see it."
"Troy_Campbell","8","3","10","27 December 2012"," Not flawless, but an enjoyably immersive outing.
","As far as enormous motion pictures go, this trilogy opener is right up there. It may run an hour shy of any of the LOTR instalments, yet director Peter Jackson packs in just as many sprawling set-pieces, spanning vistas, jostling subplots and larger-than-life characters, for better and for worse. The action sequences are well-choreographed and, from a technical standpoint, simply outstanding; the computer effects are mostly seamless and, unlike in LOTR, it's often difficult to see where flesh ends and green screen begins. There's a catch though: the increasingly gigantic battles against and/or amongst Goblins, Orcs, Trolls and Storm Giants lack a sense of real danger thanks to the 13 Dwarfs and sole Hobbit continuously escaping with barely even a scratch. You know, because they have lots of courage and stuff. But hey, it looks terrific. As do the New Zealand – sorry, Middle Earth – landscapes (which unsurprisingly get countless high shots lavished upon them) and the grand, CGI-rendered sets; both of which are gloriously shot by the Oscar-winning cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, who has worked with Jackson on each of his films since Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>A blockbuster can't succeed without a decent storyline and An Unexpected Journey is no exception. In addition to J.R.R. Tolkien's award-winning 1937 novel, screenwriters Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro (who was originally going to direct, but pulled out due to a delayed production schedule) pillage the plethora of appendixes and unfilmed LOTR material, as well as introducing new information to pad out the proceedings. They wisely never skimp on characterisation and tell enough back-story to enlighten those of us who aren't overly familiar with the book; however there are also a handful of talkative scenes that well and truly outstay their welcome. Despite a gazillion characters warring for screen time, the major players are all rounded out nicely too. Bilbo, as played by the sublime Martin Freeman, is a charismatic, humorous and captivating protagonist who is easy to spend a few hours with, whilst Dwarf leader Thorin (Richard Armitage) is a vertically challenged, but much more interesting, version of Aragon who almost steals the show from Mr Baggins.<br/><br/>Definitely not flawless (most frustratingly, Gandalf's powers appear to be bound by narrative necessity) however this first entry is immersive enough to be a rollicking good time at the cinema."
"jeremyvize","10","3","10","27 December 2012"," Absolutely fantastic!
","I could not be a bigger fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They are without doubt, the best films in the world. I had heard mixed reviews of the Hobbit, and wasn't too sure what to expect. However when i walked into that cinema and heard that music again i realized there wasn't anything more to expect than utter brilliance. I have never had to experience waiting for another Lord of the Rings film, as when i first watched them my father had already got the special extended edition box set. I now realize what a torture it must have been for people to have to wait for another film to come out. The summarize I cannot wait for the next Hobbit film and i know, it will only be as good, if not better than the previous one."
"seghers","6","3","10","26 December 2012"," Eh... Pretty good.
","I thought The Hobbit was... pretty good. It was a nice visit back to Middle Earth. A little drawn out (three movies... really?) but at the same time, the characters besides Bilbo and Gandalf remain very thinly drawn. A week after seeing the movie, I am not really left with much to remember about them. One was very fat. Great special effects, of course, and Gollum was amazing. The scene between Bilbo and Gollum is by itself almost worth the price of admission. I will see the other two movies, but I'm not NEARLY as excited about it as I was with the original trilogy movies. Judging by the first film, this is but a shadow of those films- not just in terms of scope (since The Hobbit was a quieter book to be sure), but also in terms of heart. With all that film time, the spell that has been woven to date is not very compelling. Been there, and doing it again, half-heartedly."
"hannahbeth4452","6","3","10","25 December 2012"," Highs and lows, Great and yet not so great, all in all a GOOD ENOUGH film, but not a fantastic one
","I'm a little surprised to find that most people are giving either very high or very low scores to this film. I'm surprised because the movie felt a little 'middle of the road' to me. It had GREAT parts, and it had not so great parts. It doesn't triumph; it doesn't fall flat on its face.<br/><br/>Despite claims that the movie is 'extremely accurate' to the book, I found myself struggling to recall where some scenes came from(such as the 'Radagast the Brown' side story, or the Pale Orc as a villain). On the other hand, quotes from the book were sprinkled throughout, and the memorable milestones were remembered. It wasn't a film that left anything out. If anything, it INSERTED, which felt a little unnecessary given that the film was so long. But you have to go into movies like this opened minded, because what works in text and what works on film are sometimes two different things. Breaking it into three films allows them to show everything BUT possibly created the need for an antagonist, and motivating force which the strict narrative might not have provided. Maybe they needed conflict and resolution by the end of part one, to feel like a complete film. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Visually, the film looked good. The CGI fit seamlessly into the environment, and the actors fit their roles well. One of my most positive reactions to the movie was the choice for Bilbo! I felt like Thorin Oakenshield was little too un-dwarfy, which leads me to a point I'd like to make. That while the film looked GOOD, I didn't get that 'Ooh! Thats EXACTLY how I imagined it!"" thing like I did with the other LOTR films. (With the exception of the EXCELLENT 'Bilbo meets Gollum' segment, of course.) Nothing looked bad, and there was some nice creativity, but it felt a little out of character.<br/><br/>The Hobbit (book) was lighter than the LOTR, which is what I loved about it. However, I felt that the film traded charm for cheap laughs at times. People defend the film's humor by saying they were going for a lighter tone, but if you failed at making a charming heart warming film and had to douse it in jokes to make it 'light'... well you should possibly rethink you strategy moving forward. You can't create tone with surface level gags and gimmicks. <br/><br/>As I mentioned with the 'Bilbo, Gollum' scene, there were some fantastic highs to this film. Among them, are the eagles swooping in to save the day, the Dwarfs low rumbly singing, and getting to see Rivendell up close and for longer periods of time. There were also some lows: sometimes the scenery, though creative, felt like it didn't quite 'fit' into the LOTR universe. I understand this can't be LOTR 4, BUT it DOES take place in the same place right? Shouldn't it look/feel somewhat similar? Characters and scenes were expanded in not always so great ways. There was some O.K. humor, and some that was downright corny. <br/><br/>If you take all as one lump, I have to give it a 'so-so'. It succeeds and fails. Hopefully, with the production hullabaloo (switching directors etc.) over and done, it will pull itself together more and more before the end of the trilogy.<br/><br/>(I also want to end by saying that I do NOT classify myself as a Tolkein fan/follower. The Hobbit is a charming, lovely little read that I've loved for a long time, but I'm not one of ""those"" people. Any bias/snobbery you may seem to find in this review comes not from my undying devotion to a specific book, but from a lifelong love and prolific reading/watching of fairy tale/children's works. I've compared this film, not to a book, but to other films that capture the imagination, in order to choose a score.)"
"KoreanPenguin","8","3","10","22 December 2012"," The Lord of the Hobbits
","Having seen the original Lord of the Rings trilogy too many times to count, I had certain expectations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Fortunately, many of those inner-most needs I possessed were met, however, there will still a few stumbling points within the movie itself.<br/><br/>We will start with the good, nay, the amazing! Peter Jackson follows through on his commitment to honoring Tolkien's years of work as a successful writer. There are so many absolutely beautiful scenes in this movie. Whether it's a helicopter pan of our team making their way across the deserted, fantastic landscape of Middle-Earth, or a slow zoom-in to the delicate, yet wonderful Last Homely Home of Rivendell.<br/><br/>I wasn't in love with Gollum in the original trilogy, but I was completely in-tune and fascinated with the riddles in the dark scene. I saw Gollum in new light, where his desperation hadn't fully kicked-in yet (albeit, on it's way within a few decades though I'm sure.)<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, I was once in love with a woman named Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as the same tales written by Tolkien himself in his six book series of the same name, so absolutely any inclusion of foreshadowing of the events of the Third Age to come, such as the existence of Sauron, as well as the Witch-king of Angmar sufficiently squelched my need, by feeding it, and then giving me even more juicy details through conversations between 'former baddies' such as Saruman, having a somewhat critical, yet joy-filled conversation with the Lady Galadriel, featuring 'former woman' from Cloud Atlas, Sir Hugo Weaving, reprising his role as Elrond.<br/><br/>Howard Shore again heads up the department with music, and does so to amazing effect, incorporating themes and motives from the Lord of the Rings, while making this soundtrack quite distinct, as you will see. You may feel a creep of goosebump-infected nostalgia roll over yourself as you hear some of them.<br/><br/>Now the bad, unfortunately. Or maybe not bad, but a little bit of a downer.<br/><br/>There were added pieces to this story that were entirely unfamiliar to Hobbit-aficionados, which works to an extent, but at some point, the warg chases grow to be somewhat repetitive. In the same way I tired of the non-stop, fabricated ringwraith chases in Fellowship. Also the inclusion of, said ""one-armed orc king"". Or, the inclusion of, said ""fat-chinned, massively over-disgusting goblin leader/king/whatever"".<br/><br/>The funny bit is, fans who are unfamiliar to the children's book will not notice these additions, and probably won't care. For those of us who are attached to page-by-page description, it might matter some, or become a deal breaker for others.<br/><br/>I should have added this into the pluses, but there is not a single character who was miscast in their role, neither were there any flat performances by any of our heroes, or villains, for that matter. I was, however, trying to distinguish dwarfs throughout the movie, and by the end, multiple dwarfs just looked to me as the same person. Lord of the Rings at least had different races of Middle-Earth denizens, that it worked, but here not so much. Which pains me to say, but 12 characters of the same, yet unfamiliar race make things hard for the audience in my opinion.<br/><br/>Finally, the 3D. I was blessed to view this film also at 48fps, which was quite wonderful, and I think works for Jackson, maybe not only to an extent, but fully. 3D has come off to me only as a gimmick, added to movies just for the effect, but since this was no cheap conversion of an already decent film, the 3D really works here. It's a little unsettling having arrows flying at your face, or a butterfly teetering it's way from one side of the screen to the other. The action and fight scenes were completely astounding, with so many humorous moments, yet so many very exciting ones as well. However, in 3D, I was sometimes lost in the action, which was a little disorienting, but a quick recovery will follow, nonetheless.<br/><br/>There were some very cheesy moments, like slinging dishes to the beat, but I think this is due in part to the Hobbit being a one book children's book... But this is inherently, one of the movie's few problems... It's not a six book epic. If anything, the Lord of the Rings should have been extended to something longer than a trilogy. For this Hobbit trilogy, a three movie spread will be very difficult without adding a lot of new material to Tolkien's work, and while it may be fantastic and loved by many, there will be some of us who grow tired of it. Additionally, outside of a two film spread, I don't see why we need three movies to tell an already short tale. MAKE THIS CLEAR, I loved The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I loved practically every minute of it, but I also have a hope deep down within me that this will repeat the same pattern of the original trilogy. Fellowship was filled with exposition, where The Two Towers capitalized on the exposition, and filled in an absolutely breathtaking three hours to set up the majesty and wonder that is The Return of the King, which is one of my favorite films of all time. May we pray that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy follows suit and amazes us in that very same way. Jackson hasn't let us down yet in Middle-Earth, so I don't fully expect him to now.<br/><br/>So quickly, fly on eagles wings, and cast a spell of amazement and bewilderment over yourself as you sit down for this nearly three-hour long spectacle. Hope you like motion sickness. But be very happy that this time, 3D is promised to not be a gimmick. I guarantee you will at least like, if not love, every minute you are in the theater."
"rimohit-1","9","3","10","20 December 2012"," A different experience
","The Hobbit is a book aimed at a younger audience, and the film reflects that, which will make some fans of the LOTR trilogy disappointed if they wanted the same experience. To put it simply, LOTR for me are better movies, while The Hobbit is a better adaptation.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie is too long, although I can imagine someone without much patience saying that. They take their time with the story and it's appreciated by the fans of the book. The added scenes were mostly good, and I'm looking forward to see what they'll do with the necromancer storyline.<br/><br/>The movie is not without its problems, some of the humor is too childish, some of the scenes look too cartooney or Pirates Of The Caribbean-ey, and some characters rely of CGI too much, so they lose presence they could have had. I do like that they've finally made Goblins different from Orcs, but I feel they should have been scarier.<br/><br/>Highlights: The scenes where the characters have serious talks. They really flesh the film out and keep audience involved. The Golum scenes are genius - nothing more I need to say about that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, go see the movie. Just leave both the good and the bad prejudice at home and enjoy an adventure tale that stood the test of time."
"tomimt","7","3","10","19 December 2012"," Fantastic return to Middle Earth
","Well, let's get the worst out of the way first. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is clearly the most unbalanced entry of the Jackson's Tolkien movies. The first hour is clearly a bit too long and could do some tweaking. And that's the biggest complaint I have with the movie. Other than that, it offers a fantastic return to Middle Earth.<br/><br/>After the pacing issues are resolved, the movie hits in the high gear and finds its balance, balancing between serious and whimsical, just like it should.<br/><br/>the spacial effects are again top notch and Gollum is even more spectacular creation than ever. HFR is often discussed when it comes to the Hobbit and just like many others, I noted that it works amazingly well on some scene and in some scenes it looks a bit odd, especially if there's a quick cut involved. But when it works, it works marvelously well. I often found myself dumb struck on how real everything looked. When the stone giants battled each other, I could have sworn that I was looking outside the window.<br/><br/>So, to sum it up, Jackson & co. have managed to return to the Middle Earth with honor. Not the best movie on the series, but not a horrible movie either. And I won't be expecting a EE version out of this one, as it really, really, really doesn't need one."

","""Home is now behind you. The world is ahead.""- Gandalf<br/><br/>Behind every great film, there is a great writer! ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a precise example of how a story told in pictures, and dialogues,and placed within the context of dramatic structure can become a visual masterpiece. Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. However, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel... I remember when I first time was reading ""The Hobbit"", my sister gave me the book, since that time I remember that warm-and-cosy feeling inside! I was already visualizing those scenes in my head, fairy-tale-kind-of-characters,treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers and, of course, those quiescent green heels and mountains! <br/><br/>Even if you haven't read the book, you will be fascinated by a story: Bilbo Baggins is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarfs led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's ""precious"" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities... That's the point where ""The Lord of The Rings"" trilogy can take it's start from.<br/><br/>So, to sum it up, it's not just a movie. It's an event, one of those films you must see to keep up with the conversation. Surprisingly, by today it's the best 3D film I've watched. I can't use another word, but ""clean"". It was clean 3D film, that makes you feel like home! My ten stars for you and your team, Peter Jackson! Without you, Tolkien's creations would never be known in this world, perhaps ;)"

The movie is 1/3, close to 3 hours of cinematic time and in many ways feels very similar to LOTR in terms of scenery, style and overall ambiance. Great cast, great performance and a good ride. From what I remember and what I'm told it also quite closely follows the canon of the book with a few exceptions here and there. Without any spoilers, I think it's a good ride even if you haven't seen LOTR or are a fan of Tolkien. Just be prepared for a bit of a slow opening.<br/><br/>On the negative side - my two major gripes are the CGI and that fact the film feels pretty dumbed-down, probably targeting the 13-18 demographic. Sure, CGI is part of life, especially when we talk about a fantasy title, but too much is sometimes, well, too much. I have no problem with the unnatural color saturation, heavy use of HDR and the like but there are some scenes which look just unrealistic (fall scenes primarily). Secondly, modern references such as wizards smoking too many mushrooms and a hint at Gandalf's proverbial lack of spell casting skills may provoke a smile or two but are not to the movie's benefit. Falling great distances without any injuries, etc. also works only as long as you're 16 and have pop corn left... In essence I'd say LOTR was a much more credible movie.<br/><br/>So there - 9/10 from me. I'd say I enjoyed it and can whole-heartedly recommend it."
"panicitssam","8","3","10","17 December 2012"," Enjoyed it immensely, but it's not quite on the same tier as Lord of the Rings
","On rare occasions, I find myself getting very excited for a movie's release the moment I learn about it. The Hobbit was one of those movies for me. Finally it's come out and I got to see it after waiting for a year and a half! For the most part, I wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed almost every moment, clapped at the end with the rest of the theater, and found myself wanting to see it again afterward. By all means, I should be giving this film a big 10 out of 10, no questions asked. But, despite how much I liked it, I did see some problems.<br/><br/>But first, what was good about it? Well, I know that some people didn't care for it so much, but I did really enjoy the visuals of the film. I found both the set and the character designs to be delightful and, although it was a little indulgent at times, the CGI was pretty good, too. I thought that Martin Freeman did a fabulous job as Bilbo, the stubborn, grounded little hobbit that would have preferred to stay home. I found his performance to be greatly enjoyable, especially at the scene where the dwarfs arrive quite unexpectedly on his doorstep. Ian McKellan was, of course, fantastic as Gandalf. That goes without saying. Richard Armitage, although maybe not as memorable as Freeman or McKellan, made a decent Thorin. There was one random thing I was really happy to see, and that was the incorporation of two songs. There are a lot of songs in the books and I was delighted to see a couple of them make it into the film.<br/><br/>So where did the problems come into the film? Well... There were a couple things. First, though, I'd like to say that I'm not even going to bother comparing the book to the film. I've read the Hobbit a couple of times, but it was years ago (middle school), so I don't remember too much of the book. What I did remember from the book was done reasonably well in the film. My biggest problem with the film was the incorporation of humor. Don't get me wrong, I loved that Jackson decided to lighten the tone of the film with some jokes here and there. But unfortunately, I found it to be badly misplaced at times. The slaying of the goblin king was a good example of this. At a moment like that, the humorous line of ""that'll do it"" came off as just plain... corny. I also found that most of the characters, aside from Gandalf, Bilbo, and to a lesser extent Thorin, were entirely forgettable. I barely even registered their presence at times. To be fair, the company was quite large, but I still thought that I'd care about them at least a pinch more than I did. Another problem I found was that the pacing at the beginning was very, very slow, but once the adventure got rolling, I had no problem.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the film despite its shortcomings. I would go see it again.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"venkatraman_r_76","8","3","10","17 December 2012"," Saw it in 48FPS
","Just saw this movie in the 48FPS 3D screen and I should say the experience was simply fantastic. The colors and details was mind blowing and made me feel as if I was inside the locations (Sad that we don't have IMAX screens in Chennai yet - That could have improved the experience a little bit more) I have not read the book yet but I guess the story is well told in the movie with lot of amusements and action. There is no negative about it but I could not quite understand the reason behind have the giant stone creatures scene. The second half action sequence was simply engaging with lots of fun and gave the edge of the seat thrills. Of course, the gollum part - very moving especially when Bilbo shows the hesitation to kill the creature.<br/><br/>Cant wait for the next two parts."
"caldonas-324-966080","9","3","10","15 December 2012"," Best one yet.
","For Lord of the Rings, the transition from the book to the film, left one with mixed feelings at times, partly because much of the content was snipped, and didn't make it, even in the extended edition, partly because much of what some of us considered an integral part of the original story was altered. Even so, Lord of the Rings brought Fantasy back to the fore, and became a truly groundbreaking and phenomenal trilogy of movies.<br/><br/>With The Hobbit, we have a different phenomenon. Everything that was in the book(s) is in the film... and then some! <br/><br/>It is one thing to accurately render a story with respect to the author, but what happens here is a rendition that remains true to character but also adds value.<br/><br/>The trailer, and the already high expectations had me entering the theater expecting very good entertainment for a little more than two and a half hours. What I received instead was a treat to modern storytelling of the most deep-rooted character.<br/><br/>The thorough (and very scenic) narration of the dwarfs and their past, the building of the characters, even the narration of events transpiring in the story background, is all done masterfully and beyond any expectations I already had.<br/><br/>I won't go into further detail, but will only say that this is a monumental film for the fantasy genre, taking everything to a whole new level. The hobbit is a must see for genre and book fans alike."
"creativecurrents","8","3","10","15 December 2012"," The Hobbit takes the safe road to meet audience expectations.
","Finally, after waiting 9 years since the Lord of the Rings trilogy ended, I got to revisit Middle Earth for a few hours. We went to the 10:20pm showing, arriving a little later to get good seats. So I spent 2 hr., 46 min. craning my neck up and trying to absorb the plethora of visual effects before me. And Peter Jackson and the Weta team delivered. <br/><br/>When I go to a highly anticipated movie (esp. one based on a classic book), I tend to build up so many high expectations that I'm always a little disappointed the first time watching. (I drop the comparison game and my own perceptions do not cloud the subsequent viewings). Peter Jackson did a good job re-creating Middle Earth, and the art direction is seamless with the LOTR trilogy. Yes, it's slightly jarring to see Bilbo and Frodo played by slightly older versions of themselves, but their performances remained true. Gandalf, played by Ian McKellan, got away a bit more with the age difference under the heavy makeup and wizard's cap. :) <br/><br/>The movie is pretty slow-paced for the first hour, just as Fellowship was, as it re-establishes the shire and introduces the cast of dwarfs. I wasn't sure if having so many characters would work, but it did. The dwarfs were well-casted and not just a mish-mash of slightly different characteristics. You felt they were ""real"", just like Gimli. :) In fact, it looks like some of them took some acting points or were coached by John Rhys-Davis! But once everyone is introduced, the group dynamic works well and the movie begins to hum with energy and comic relief. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the eye candy of visiting new places in Middle Earth, and seeing the back stories played out, such as The King Under the Mountain who possessed riches untold and the early accounts of Smaug's terror and destruction. The Gollum scenes were well-played, bringing the most laughs and meeting expectations for such an iconic moment in the book. The plot moved along as one might expect for the first act of this manufactured trilogy. <br/><br/>The film team had the daunting task of staying true to Tolkien's mythology, but providing something fresh that would meet audience expectations. The movie was a bit formulaic, as it tried to provide seamless cohesion to the previous films. Yes, it hit the marks and pacing of Fellowship, but in some ways, it seemed too safe. To hearken back to the trilogy, certain lines were simply repeated from previous films, which had the effect of adding staleness instead of warm feelings of re-connecting with beloved characters. And perhaps for the returning actors playing their established characters in the LOTR trilogy, this was their primary challenge. I remember Andy Serkis, who played Gollum, shared his struggle with Peter on the first day of shooting the cave scenes. He was concerned he was playing a parody of Gollum and he had to push past the impersonation to find the character again after so many years. (I'm sure both Ian's, Cate, Hugo, and Elijah felt the same way.) <br/><br/>My only disappointment is perhaps with Martin Freeman, who plays the lead of young Bilbo. I didn't feel he had the charisma and charm of Ian Holmes' portrayal of old Bilbo. At times, esp. in the earlier scenes, his performance even seemed a bit clumsy. Maybe he will shine more in the rest of the movies now that they've laid out the quest objectives in the first act. <br/><br/>Overall, I still think this is worthy to watch again. (Perhaps this time in 3-D)."
"regula1","8","3","10","14 December 2012"," A movie trying to forge ahead and stay true to its roots at the same time.
","When I went into this movie, I couldn't help comparing it to its predecessors. I'm not only talking about the Lord of the Rings trilogy and how well it would tie in to those movies. I am, of course, referring to the 1977 Rankin-Bass animated version. This is what I grew up with, and while these two movies are very distinct, they complement each other quite nicely.<br/><br/>As for the title of this review, I believe that this movie was the second attempt by Hollywood in recent years to make an adventure story into an action film, succeeding in some areas and failing in others. The first attempt was The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. As with The Hobbit, this movie was good overall but the fact that layers of action had to be heaped on to make it more marketable diminished its impact.<br/><br/>In this respect, I can see times when The Hobbit stays true to its LOTR roots and can be slotted in nicely among the franchise, as well as times when there seems to be no point besides slashing and running. However, on the whole, as with the LOTR trilogy, I look forward to the next movie to see how faithfully they stick to the book and how these events are portrayed."
"TisovcikRasto","10","3","10","14 December 2012"," One of the best adaptations I've ever seen
","I was afraid of the fact that the story was split in 3 separate movies. However, I still hoped it would turn out for the best and I'm glad I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>More screen time allowed the creators to literally film the whole book with quite a lot of additional content which is intertwined with story of The Lord of the Rings (which results in some scenes being slightly uninteresting for those who haven't seen/read TLOTR). The movie is full of incredible amount of details and it contains almost everything from the book.<br/><br/>When compared to the book, I've noticed only several minor changes. There was only one major change which I didn't like but I understand its purpose in the movie. Also, there were two jokes which seemed a little but inappropriate for an adaptation of Tolkien.<br/><br/>The overall atmosphere (altogether with colors) is far lighter than in TLOTR. This results in the fact that CGI looks sometimes a little bit ""fake"". Still, this might have been intentional.<br/><br/>In summary: The movie is a great experience. 99% of original content is on film, modified content is not that bad and additional content warms the heart of every Tolkien fan.<br/><br/>I've seen the movie in 2K resolution, 2D and without Dolby Atmos."
"CarlE361","10","4","16","25 December 2012"," The Hobbit has definitely exceeded my expectations
","Wow, all I can say is wow. An Unexpected Journey is a lovely start to what will most definitely be an amazing trilogy. It looked amazing and the 3D has been done very well making you feel as if you were there from time to time. The action scenes were great and the humour was hilarious making this a very enjoyable film. Of course the film is not exactly like the book but honestly so far it has followed the book more closely than The Lord Of The Rings did. <br/><br/>There were a few small things that were changed but Jackson would have done this in order to get on with the 'bigger picture'. There was also one fairly significant part added (it was a action scene) that did not happen in the book but this actually helped progress the story further and more smoothly. Also the way Peter has included the appendices has been quite effective and has helped improve the story by giving it more depth. <br/><br/>Although, one of these scenes did drag on a little but it's nothing to really worry about as it was still interesting. To those of you that are worried about this being a trilogy you honestly shouldn't as by the end of the film it wasn't even through half of the books material. I will definitely be seeing The Hobbit again sometime soon and I advise you all to go and see it!"
"ersinkdotcom","6","4","16","19 December 2012"," ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" isn't nearly as tedious as anticipated; although it's still nowhere near perfect
","I'm not a huge fan of the three ""Lord of the Rings"" films so my expectations were pretty low walking into ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" I'm not saying that I don't acknowledge J.R.R. Tolkien's genius and the fact that the movies do look great. I just think that they could have been half the length in their theatrical releases, much less their extended editions.<br/><br/>With all that being said, I must admit this wasn't nearly as painful to sit through as I expected. There was still plenty wrong with it, but it could have been much worse. Strangely, I can only think of a few reasons why the movie appealed to me; I just know that as I left the theater I knew I wanted to see it again.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" tells the story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure outside his comfort zone of the Shire in the wilds of Middle-earth. The wizard Gandalf and his band of dwarfs need a master burglar to accompany them on their quest to retake their kingdom from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they run into a number of different obstacles including orcs, goblins, and a strange creature calling himself Gollum.<br/><br/>Let's get the things I remember enjoying about the film out of the way first. I liked getting to see Christopher Lee as the very suspicious Saruman, even if it was only for a few minutes. I also was delighted to see Gandalf being a lot more active in battles; even if I knew it really wasn't Ian McKellen doing the fighting.<br/><br/>The other two things I really appreciated were the Pale Orc and the story of the Necromancer. According to people I spoke with after the movie, neither the Pale Orc nor the Necromancer was even in the book. Basically, what I loved about ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" had nothing to do with its source material. The last thing I was thankful for was the limit of only two annoying folk-songs sung by the dwarfs.<br/><br/>I was told that I shouldn't see the movie in 48fps and 3D as it would require me bringing an airplane barf-bag to the theater with me. I really had no intentions of seeing it in 48fps at all, but it was the only way I could at a time I was free. The negative aspects of 48fps are getting blown way out of proportion. It didn't make me ill the way I was told it would.<br/><br/>The experience is comparable to watching a Blu-ray on a hi-def TV, but it's magnified onto a big-screen. That doesn't help when it comes to make-up showing on actors and things of that nature. It also caused scenes with fast movement to blur as well. It wasn't as bad as it was made out to be by people I spoke to before viewing it.<br/><br/>I was very surprised by how bad the CGI in the film was. I would say that three-quarters of the CGI was absolutely dreadful. Everything from Rivendell to the smoke coming out of Gandalf's pipe reminded me that I was watching a movie mostly created on a computer. I wouldn't expect that WETA will be getting much business outside of Peter Jackson after other filmmakers see this.<br/><br/>There were many points during ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" where I found myself drifting off. As usual, Jackson has a tendency to not know when enough is enough with lengthy scenes of landscape, mountains, and walking. He sure loves to watch people walk. The sequence where Bilbo and Gollum quiz each other was also a chore to get through.<br/><br/>I know many people who had high expectations were let down by ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" Maybe my lower expectations made the film seem more acceptable to me. One thing I will say is it's jam-packed full of Middle-earth facts and background information; so much so that at times it feels as if it's going to burst at the seams and spill out all over the audience. I definitely don't think we'll have to worry about any more movies after these three ""Hobbit"" ones. Jackson will have nothing left to exploit if this first entry is an example of what to expect from the next two."
"alexadempsey","3","4","16","18 December 2012"," May Contain spoilers
","As one who has always been a fan of the hobbit (my first exposure being the 1977 Cartoon), I must say I was mortified by what I saw on that screen. First of all, there were characters that were never once mentioned in the book. That by itself baffled me as I would never have thought to tamper with the perfection that the book was. Second, there were scene that were obviously filler so Peter Jackson could stretch a classic tale into another three movies about walking and getting dirt under their fingernails. On top of that, I feel Peter Jackson betrayed himself as an artist with the standards he set in the first LOTR movie by not using actual extras for his Orc instead of CGI. <br/><br/>Anyway, I have now ranted and put my piece out there for anyone who is as in love with the real story as I, beware, and don't go into it expecting to see a true rendition, instead, go in expecting nothing and you will enjoy yourself more. Or, stick with the book and 1977 cartoon."
"DUKEJBM","Null","4","16","14 December 2012"," Massive disappointment that's often massively dull
","There's no dodging it, this is a massive disappointment on almost every level. It's an overly long and rather mind-numbing film that doesn't even offer the courtesy of a semblance of an ending. Yes, I know they are taking a page from the original trilogy and telling the tale in three parts but I wish they had at least offered some sort of payoff in this installment.<br/><br/>The first forty minutes absolutely drags and is as tedious as any film in recent memory. The entire first act feels like a dull parody of a Disney/Snow White/Dwarfs film complete with two singing numbers. They couldn't even use that time to give us relatable bases or depth for the characters they want us to follow for three films. Bilbo is a sniveling ninny throughout all forty minutes and you can't tell one dwarf from the other outside of the king.<br/><br/>Also, the CGI seems to be a step back which is bizarre. A lot of things and scenes looked horribly fake. I'm talking ""Clash of the Titans"" remake bad CGI (except Gollum- he was again exceptional) Then, there's the same ole plot flaw from the very first film surrounding the use of those giant game changing eagles.<br/><br/>All-in-all, there's nothing here that's thrilling and nothing that can come close to matching the grandeur or feel of the originals."

The movie was entertaining through all 3 hours. But in its own way.<br/><br/>""But one must not simply"" walk into this film thinking that they are going to see LOTR entertainment. Because LOTR had a more comprehensive storyline than this movie. LOTR gives you a full third eyed look into the world of middle earth. From so many point of views. While the storyline of ""The Hobbit"" is presented much more simple. LOTR was like watching Game of Thrones. There was so many stories and so many point of views, therefore at much more deep insight to the world of Middle Earth. When seeing ""The Hobbit"", some people might only notice the main story and that can leave the viewer sleeping through the last one and a half our of the film. BUT! That is one of the reasons that I am writing this review. Because there is not only one story. There is several more concerning some of the characters in the movie<br/><br/>So if you have not seen this movie. Please note that there is a lot more to notice than the main story and I think you get to see more of it in the upcoming movies. <br/><br/>That was the positive part of this review. <br/><br/>The bad parts of this movie is among other:<br/><br/>Way to much use of computer animation. The scenario and locations in the movie did not seem real at all. I noticed that there was almost no wind, even though they were in a forest and even though they were on top of a hill. The voices of some of the orcs and other creatures was definitely not like LOTR. There was to much animation at parts where it was not needed. It seemed like watching a Disney/Pixar animation. The voices and sounds of the creatures(orcs, trolls etc) was not convincing at all. Well not as in LOTR. And for me, that was really sad.<br/><br/>LOTR was like watching ""Kingdom of Heaven, Troy, Robin Hood, Gladiator"" but with ""realistic/credible"" creatures and magic.<br/><br/>While ""The Hobbit"" was a really, really, really, really good film sequence of a Computer game.<br/><br/>Don't expect 100% LOTR, but expect 100% entertainment.<br/><br/>I hope that found my review was useful and sorry for the (maybe) bad grammar and spelling - I am from Denmark."

I loved the the LOTR, as I believe they are masterpieces that will not be remade in my lifetime or ever.<br/><br/>The Hobbit, while not as serious or perhaps as developed as LOTR was. Think about the book that it has to draw its information on. It's a children's book, not an in-depth work of fiction for adults. It has been adapted and it has other sources of Tolkien lore thrown into it to bulk it out and mature its storyline. I felt that this was done to preserve the movie for years to come and to allow a wider audience to enjoy it. Personally as an adult, I don't want to follow on from LOTR (being directed at adults) then going to watch a children's movie.<br/><br/>Currently it's an incomplete story, before all of the naysayers pass judgment wait until all three films have been released.<br/><br/>Personally I am glad that more movies like these are coming out.

This is an original piece and I'm glad it's here to shake up the status quo. I think everyone should take a big step back and think about the kind off movies you want on screen - do you want another so called ""comedy"" from the likes of Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn, or try hard remakes like ""21 jump street"". <br/><br/>No thanks...I certainly am over these movies.

"dangon-nvat","9","3","11","2 January 2013"," Few titles can compete with this sort of Epicness
","This review is going to be spoiler free.<br/><br/>First of all, let me explain where i'm coming from: I absolutely love the original Lord of the Rings trilogy despite never actually reading any of the books (update: I just recently started reading TFOTR). Basically all above applies to The Hobbit as well. <br/><br/>I haven't read the book but I completely loved the movie. Even though it's not really my place to say, I feel I have to address some of the criticism regarding the choice to make another trilogy based on a book that is shorter than any single book from the original LOTR trilogy. Whether this decision is to be put on the shoulders of Peter Jackson or the publisher, it is undoubtedly a questionable decision. Personally, having seen the movie, I don't feel as strongly against it as I initially did walking in to the theater. In fact, I never really felt as if they were ""filling out"" with unnecessary - well, maybe somewhat - but definitely not boring parts. It gave a lot of backstory while not laying too much weight on things outside of the quest. Considering that the LOTR movies have always been about the journey itself and - more specifically - the circumstances and arbitrary things that the travelers encounter during their journey, this movie has reached that level of epicness - a level that some may consider only to be matched by it's predecessors. At the end of the day, this is what makes up the nearly-unmatched, incredibly fantastic feeling of an epic and grand adventure that is what we all have to come to expect from the Lord of the Rings and it's adventures portrayed through the vision of Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>The Good: - All things essential to a tale of J.R.R Tolkien - the characters, the atmosphere, the setting, the environments, the dialog - The music is as always incredibly strong and yet another milestone for Howard Shore (though two things I feel you should know: 1. There is no kind of superepic tune that you will find yourself mumbling while sitting on the toilette - well maybe with the exclusion of the dwarf song about the lonely mountain. 2. The use of LORT theme is very little of any at all) - Martin Freeman gives a great performance (not perfect, but great). - Surprisingly I'm going to say that the 48 fps was actually quite spectacular and made the whole movie (especially panoramic shots and action scenes) look a whole lot crisper and simply more beautiful. <br/><br/>The Bad: - (I know it's old clichÃ© but............) It was to damn short. - There will probably not be any extended/directer/limited/what-ever-they-call-it-it's-all-the- the-same edition with additional scenes."

","I have seen the first two movies of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and have read the Hobbit when I was in elementary school. I didn't realize the film was done by Peter Jackson, until the end. Nonetheless, I was expecting a good movie and that's what I saw. This was my first time seeing a movie in high definition and it was quite amazing. The acting was powerful, the scenery breathtaking and the sound effects were incredible. I don't remember the book well enough to know how true the movie stays to Tolkien's text, but I do know that the book wasn't as gory or violent as the movie. This is my only complaint about the movie; when you take a children's book and make it into a blockbuster film, parents will think it's safe to bring their kids to it, and it's not. There is already enough violence in Hollywood films, and I was disappointed that the movie intensified the fantasy violence in the book. Other than that, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great film and if you're over 18, I would encourage you to see it."

","Having high expectations after LOTR, this movie really let me down for several reasons. Sections of it dragged very slowly, perhaps to fill time to make it last for three films. The action scenes were shown very quickly and disjointedly, probably to hide unbelievable special effects, it was like watching the SciFi channel at some points in the show. One scene looked obviously like a small model, this surprised me because of the high quality of the special effects in the previous movies, this seemed like a low budget release in comparison. Furthermore, I went to the 3D version, and because most of the film was quite dark to begin with, 3D glasses made it even darker. Perhaps those who saw the 48 frame/sec version had a far different viewing experience than I did, but the seemingly lower quality filming compared to LOTR made it much less enjoyable, and another disappointment for me was that this film supplies little reason to care about the characters, except for the ones you already knew."

","REVIEW: THE HOBBIT (JACKSON, 2012) <br/><br/>Middle earth had made its much anticipated return to the big screen. The Hobbit: An Excepted Journey is the prequel story to the The Lord of the Rings, as if anybody was unaware. The story again focuses on a hobbit as the central figure in the adventure, a hobbit aforementioned in LOTR, Bilbo Baggins. The movie is based sixty years prior to its predecessor, and although it is its own film, links between the two are obvious in many areas of the film. The movie develops the amiable relationship between Bilbo and Gandalf from its inception. The tale is told when thirteen dwarfs arrive at the Baggins household acquaint from word of Gandalf, the dwarfs are lead by the uncrowned king Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror, his reason for assembling the ensemble of his kin is to take back Erebor from Smaug. The dwarfs are accompanied by Gandalf and by recommendation from the great wizard Bilbo is included in the company as 'burglar'. After initial reluctance to leave The Shire, inquisitive arousal as to what is beyond Hobbiton borders from Gandalf, initiates Bilbo's departure onto a journey he will never forget. <br/><br/>The film lacks pace in the opening exchanges and the pace does not accelerate until three mountain trolls capture the company, but soon after the scene the film falls back into its accustomed pace. There are small bouts of action betwixt the copious exposition. The bountiful elucidation could have been the intention to leave no stone unturned in the telling of the novel over the three movies, but the beginning of the movie makes you feel as though the oncoming 170 minutes will take there toll. Although the films final hour breezes by with a return to what fans have been acquainted to from The Lord of the Rings, using some recycled music pieces from the trilogy, a film score that quiet frankly ranks up there with some of the best non-diegetic music pieces ever conceived for a motion picture. The epic familiar film score is used once again in perfect unison with what is on-screen music, which annotates the emotions and feel of what is being viewed. Another resurfacing component is the breath taking sights of New Zealand, the natural backdrops used in the movie make the film look better than any CGI movie could hope to construct. Again shot by the very talented cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, the shots of the mountains and rivers, alongside director Peter Jacksons chosen long panning and establishing shot of the vast landscape give an elegant look upon what is being viewed; it also makes middle earth look endless. The entire spectacle in terms of location and scope is something to behold. <br/><br/>Something not seen in the Lord of the Rings, is the friend-full, humanitarian side of Saruman the White (Christopher Lee), as he seeks council with Gandalf (Ian Mckellan) along with Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) when the company goes to Rivendell. The scene is arguably the best in the entire movie from fans of the Tolkien story. This intricate part of the film displays the reluctance of Saruman to accept the enemies resurgence (whether he is part of it yet is unknown), Elronds reading of Thorins map to help them on their quest. This almost cuts the film in half, as prior to the Rivendell the film is mainly exposition and seems to be tying up a few questions from the previous film trilogy. The films pace accelerates from there on in, as a fight between rock giants, made from the mountain whilst the company stands upon them. The introduction of the former ring owner Gollum is then executed exactly to how it is in the book, to escape the cavern Bilbo finds he must converse with Gollum, in which they have a battle of riddles to see if Gollum will assist Bilbo or if Gollum will have Bilbo for dinner. <br/><br/>Although not vast in scope like most in LOTR, the film is still very intense and parades the magical ability of Gandalf, befitting his distinguished stature as a wizard. This magic was never really seen in LOTR, apart from scarce glimpses. The final battle also endorses the ascension of two characters, Gandalf's to leader of the company and credible joint-focal character of the movie. Bilbo, who comes to the aid of Thorin after what must be said an anti-climactic sequence (whereby they use one of the franchises more powerful numbers over a slow motion charge from Thorin to Azgog) though the former is downed before he even raises his weapon, which was quiet disappointing. There is a typically stupendous establishing shot of the mountain that consequentially sets up the next film The Desolation of Smaug, infusing it with premonition and speculation as what the next instalment holds. A notion echoed by the final shot of the film, a marvellous panning shot inside Erabor, ending with a close up shot of Smaug's eye opening.<br/><br/>Praise must be given to Martin Freeman for his depiction of Bilbo Baggins, he gives the subtext elements of determination and aspirations of finding more than The Shire can offer. The way in which his character arcs from the guy that doesn't belong, to the guy whose belonging cannot be questioned is admirable. Ian Mckellans performance is as usual magnificent, I also think Hugo Weaving brings class to the films through Elrond, the pronunciation he uses during his dialogue extenuates the enigmatic nature of the tale.<br/><br/>Compiling all the previously mentioned attributes and taking away the draw backs of the film is one that needs to be seen by all audiences. With all the good elements that combine to great this motion picture it stops just short of a masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings trilogy."

","It's been eleven years since Peter Jackson brought us groundbreaking Lord of the Rings trilogy, and nine years since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the mother of all conclusions. It went on to win every award that it was nominated for, and damn did it deserve it. Wow, it's really hard to believe that that was nine years ago. Nine years after that extraordinary film, Peter Jackson has brought us what is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. I'm going to call it The Hobbit Part 1, because the title is way too long.<br/><br/>So, I'm going to lay it out there: If you have no idea what a Hobbit is, who Gandalf is, who Bilbo is, what an orc is, you have no business being there. I'm sorry, it's true. It won't be nearly as special. I love the first three, especially the finale. They are all masterful. But this one has been getting mixed signals. I wasn't expecting it to be as good, so when I heard the mixed reviews, I became slightly skeptical. But once I sat down in that chair, and the movie started, and I heard that Lord of the Rings tune, it felt as if I was taken back to 2001 when I saw the original. It won me over immediately.<br/><br/>The film is set 60 years before the trilogy, where Bilbo (Love Actually's Martin Freeman, who is the perfect choice) encounters Gandalf the Grey(the always wonderful Ian Mckellan, welcome back) one afternoon, and his life is changed forever. A group of dwarfs come knocking on his door, and they want to win back their town from a dragon named Smaug who has basically destroyed it. Smaug, by the way, is living in a palace filled with treasure.<br/><br/>Now, another reason why I was skeptical was because of the decision to turn one little book into a trilogy. Is the trilogy necessary? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Jackson has squeezed every single detail from the book into this movie, and it really makes you wonder what the next six hours of the trilogy will encounter. But the way I see it, the more the merrier.<br/><br/>Part 1 has moments of greatness, many moments, in fact. But yet there are some moments that could've been cut. The best moment of the film comes about two hours in, when Bilbo and Gollum(played perfectly once again by Andy Serkis. Give this man an Oscar already!) play a game of riddles.<br/><br/>The Hobbit could've been shorter, and two movies could've sufficed, but Jackson is a master. He knows what he's doing, and I'm hoping that his vision is accurate. I had a really good time at The Hobbit Part 1. It's got all of the majesty and magic that the first three had, and I can't wait for the next two I still don't understand the mixed reviews. Critics can go screw themselves, this is really good. Lord of the Rings good? Eh, but close enough.<br/><br/>Oh,last thing, bring back Gollum. I don't care if his character is through, find a way to bring him back. And while you're at it, go ahead and bring back Galadriel, Sarumon, Elrond, and Frodo(it was nice seeing you all again). The nostalgia really helped tie the movie together nicely. Please. Thank you.<br/><br/>A-"
"Donnelson1","10","3","11","18 December 2012"," . . . unusual film and filming method used for Hobbits
","This movie was supposed to be filmed with the same film stock (Kodak 3256) used to film E.T. but since there was not enough film available, the director decided to film it at twice the speed of normal speed. He also decided to used a digital medium instead of the old analogue method which was an excellent idea because even though vinyl sounds better than CD's and 70mm film looks better than the best digital projection, it was actually easier to use zero's and one's instead of the base ten system to make this movie since it is almost 180 minutes long. 1.5 times longer than E.T. (The original version - not the director's cut) At 60 frames a second, there is no intermission but if it had been projected at the std. rate of 30 frames a second, then the movie would have been six hours long )plus or minus 60 minutes) The movie's plot very much resembles the std. Greek tragedy three act play. The characters are costumed so that the audience can tell one actor from the other. The music was composed before the movie was shot and so the movie was perfectly conformed to the music. However, all the dialogue was spoken after the film was completed to maintain a constant lip sync. No electrons were harmed during the digital filming of this movie although their polarity may have been changed. The high point of the film is about 38 minutes into the movie when - if you look at the upper right hand side of the scene, a boom microphone can clearly be seen waving about and then the black foam, used to cut down on the wind noise, falls off and hits one of the elfs on the head and knocks him out cold. This was not in the original book but the director took artistic license to add this key scene to the shooting script rather than refilming the scene. The latest report is the elf was not seriously injured by the cylindrical piece of foam. I stayed till the credits ended and I was sure glad I did. When the auditorium lights came on, I was the last person left and on my way out, I picked up a half eaten tub of buttered popcorn and a warm Diet Coke which allowed me to walk into the next theater as if I had just bought my snacks. No one stopped me at the door to look at my ticket. I have pulled this ruse for the last two decades and has saved me a whole bunch of money on first run movies and snacks. I question the rating of the film because my dod had to hide her eyes with her paws during several brutal scenes involving the animal extra's who turned out only got half the std. pay for extra's only because they were animals and they were also not allowed to eat any of the catered food. So the rating I feel is maybe a bit misleading so you should preview this movie before you bring your pets. I look forward to parts two and three and will be writing a review for these parts but I am seriously considering not taking my dog until I preview the movie or I might even wait until the bluray (pet safe) DVD is released. I can only speak for my dog and not forany other pets especially cats. The movie seems to fly by, especially the credits which are flying by at twice the speed because of being projected at 60 frames a second. I would recommend getting in line early for this film and have a pizza and cokes delivered to you in line while you wait and this way you won't have to wait in another snack bar line. Because of the length of this film, I would suggest bringing at least a gallon of filtered water for each member of your party, dress in layers, pack plenty of energy bars and bring a rain parka and one of those thermal blankets that fold up really small. Try not and look at the movie poster in the lobby as you proceed to your seat because of the obvious plot spoilers that are clearly hidden in plain sight. Try and not look too closely at the full title as it will give away the reason all these little trolls are going on a journey. In respect for the those people who don't put salt on their popcorn, please don't throw salt over your shoulders even though the theater owners condone such actions."
"atn_iitd","9","3","11","17 December 2012"," I love it but really 3 movies for a 300 page novel
","I am a big fan of Tolkien's work and hence with all those visual effects the movie was quite fantastic. However, what I disliked about it is the overall concept of covering it in 3 movies. It was a entirely wise decision with LOTR series but here I sense these people have gone a bit greedy and 3 is a far fetched number. That also explained all that dragging around in the initial phases of the movie which could have been avoided if they'd have restricted themselves to 1/2 parts only. Having said that, it still was a wonderful watch with all those effects and fantastic to see trolls, wargs, great eagles and specially big mountains fighting in 3D effects."
"blhurry","10","3","11","17 December 2012"," Users know best
","The user reviews are a more accurate reflection of the films quality and entertainment value. The first ten minutes were worrisome as there is definitely something wrong technically with the film during the sweeping vistas in the beginning that are without question blurry and difficult to look at. Once the panning and swirling camera settles down however the film quickly settles into the plot and carries on entrancingly to the end.<br/><br/>It's quite awesome seeing images that I have visualized in my mind since age 10 come to life on screen. I thought the CGI and life action were blended superbly. I did not feel that any part of the film dragged on and unlike some parts of LOTR. I was ultimately surprised the movie ended so quickly, i.e it definitely did not feel like nearly 3 hours and I would have been happy to watch more of the film in the same sitting. Did it deserve the 10 I gave it? No, probably an 8 or 9 would have sufficed but an imbalance needed to be righted against the abysmal, undeserved critic's meta-score. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters. I wish they could fix the opening sequence to not be so dizzying and re-release it before more people see it."
"kahverengi73","8","3","11","16 December 2012"," HFR highly overrated
","In this review I just wanted to talk about HFR. Maybe it's just me but HFR has an opposite effect on me then what it's supposed to have. I read many reviews from HFR enthusiasts about how HFR makes everything sharper, brighter and smoother. <br/><br/>The colors and images certainly were bright and sharp and pleasant to look at. But the speed and smoothness I didn't get. My eyes and brain tell me that it's not natural what I'm seeing and it's very distracting. Actually to me the high speed action scenes looked as if they were in slow-motion. I truly hope that HFR doesn't become a standard. To me it was very uncomfortable to watch."
"mattyN","10","3","11","16 December 2012"," Amazing!
","OK. I was one of the many who guffawed at the idea of this relatively short book being turned into a trilogy. I assumed this was a box office ploy, plain and simple. However, being the Tolkien nut that I am I still made it for opening weekend (which I pretty much NEVER do now that I have small boy -- more on that at the end of this review).<br/><br/>Wow. Talk about pleasant surprises. From the minute the movie opens and takes us off to Lake-town and Dwarven Kingdom of Erebor (before the dragon Smaug unleashes his attack) it is clear that Peter Jackson is dropping us back into the same Middle Earth he introduced in LOTR. A Middle Earth that is extremely rich in history and could (dare I say it) spawn dozens of movies.<br/><br/>I have seen complaints that the opening in Hobbiton (where Bilbo is recruited to the company of Thorin) drags. These will not be fans of the book as the movie takes its time and stays true to the narrative in very satisfying manner. Those who are in it for the action need only wait until the second hour when the battles begin in epic fashion and actually border on ""over the top."" However, the sparkling 3D imagery (see it with the High Frame Rate if possible) is truly entertaining and rarely feels forced. While Peter Jackson could have easily trimmed down the battle scenes I think he wanted to be sure all movie goers (not just us Middle Earth geeks) felt they were getting their money's worth.<br/><br/>Of course we knew that Gandalf (Ian Mckellan) would be in the movie and if you watched even one trailer you knew Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) would be back as well. However, the presence of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and the older Bilbo (Ian Holm) at the beginning, then later Elrond (Hugo Wallace Weaving), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and, of course, Gollum really give this film a strong bond to LOTR and make it feel like a true prequel (unlike another recent much-hyped Hollywood prequel trilogy).<br/><br/>Jackson does a remarkable job of staying true to the tone he created for Middle Earth in LOTR while managing to water things down just enough to ensure that the Hobbit (unlike LOTR) remains the children's story it is. If the Goblin King seems a little comical (and not so scary), well, that is intentional. If Radagast the Brown (a lower wizard) seems a bit silly, again, that is intentional. In fact, the conceptualization of Radagast who is only briefly mentioned by Tolkien is a great example of Peter Jackson's brilliance. Peter Jackson takes a few liberties but they are taken with care and even the passionate LOTR fan is likely to suspect that the details added to his character (with the possible exception of his ""rabbit sled"") are bits that Tolkien would likely appreciate.<br/><br/>Now, this is a children's movie and I have a 6 y/o boy. I really wanted to take him but I showed him the trailer and Gollum scared the pants off him so he went to the zoo with Mom while I enjoyed this fabulous weekend treat. I knew right away I made the correct decision. I am no parenting expert but just because this movie is geared more towards younger viewers than LOTR certainly does not mean it is for all kids. I suspect 8 or 9 years is roughly the age needed to grasp the larger plot points and not be freaked out by the many scary creatures of Middle Earth. Yes, the violence is reduced compared to LOTR but the huge wolves (Wargs) and Orcs are just as scary to look at. Although we are only given glimpses of the mighty dragon Smaug (awesome foreshadowing) he will unquestionably be epic and terrifying (at least to young viewers) when he is released upon the screen. I can't wait."
"caseymoviemania","6","3","11","15 December 2012"," Casey's Movie Mania: THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012)
","The good news is, THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY will satisfy (a lot) of die-hard fans who have read the J.R.R. Tolkien's book. And at the same time, the familiar majestic feel and strong visual flair that we have grown accustomed to Jackson's epic filmmaking style is there. But the bad news is, the movie is mostly a long-winded slog and unnecessarily bloated that might frustrate a lot of casual viewers.<br/><br/>The original J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit book is actually runs at less than 300 pages and that's considerably thin. Generally, one feature movie is more than enough but writer-director Peter Jackson is daring enough to expand its storyline to a nearly three-hour long. That is certainly very ambitious, but Jackson also make a big mistake of overloading his story expansion with lots of unnecessary fillers and extraneous characters that he could have trimmed off instead. Not to mention that Jackson and his co-writers (Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro) drags awfully a lot during the start, especially in the scene involving Gandalf and the 13 dwarfs crashes at Bilbo's home, making a mess and also taking their times to sing not one, but two musical numbers. Yes, I understand it is sometimes necessary to understand the nature of the dwarfs' characters but at the same time, is it really necessary for Jackson and his fellow screenwriters to stretch such scene that long? Even when Bilbo's ""unexpected journey"" begins, you would expect Jackson has finally find his proper footing and set a strong momentum ahead. But alas, the story continues to bog down ahead and it's really a butt-numbing experience to sit through. That's not all, you'll be surprised that all the countless attacks from trolls, wolves and Orcs feel more like an afterthought.<br/><br/>But luckily the movie manages to show some good sign of life once it reaches to the second half. A brief, but spectacular sequence where Bilbo and the 13 dwarfs find themselves caught in the middle of the thunderstorm while the mountains they are crossing suddenly comes to life and starts fighting each other. The scene where those towering stone giants hurling rocks at each other is certainly a sight to behold. Subsequent sequence afterwards grow progressively better with the movie's most memorable scene involving Bilbo and Gollum engage in an intense competition of riddles. That single scene alone is tautly directed, yet suspenseful enough to keep you attentive at all time. Last but not least, is the exciting sequence where Gandalf leads the 13 dwarfs as they march forward across the multi-level wooden bridge while fighting an endless army of goblins. In that particular scene, Andrew Lesnie's swooping camera-work that track the battle is akin of experiencing a roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>Despite some of the unnecessary extraneous characters, most of the cast here are good enough to warrant some attention. Martin Freeman is perfectly cast as the plucky, yet likable Bilbo Baggins and he's the kind of unlikely charming hero viewers love to root for. As the wise Gandalf, Ian McKellen slips his iconic role like a glove and his commanding performance is as captivating as ever. Richard Armitage is engaging enough as the hardheaded Thorin. And of course, not forgetting Andy Serkis, who reprises his memorable role as Gollum. His particular scene where he shows all the frustration and despair during a game of riddles is a terrific work of acting expression.<br/><br/>Technical credits are top-notch, and again I must noted that Andrew Lesnie continues to spellbind us with his epic cinematography that gives the movie such a majestic quality. While the special effects are considerably better than those in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, some of the CG looks spotty in place (notably in the chase scene involving the Orcs at the open mountain).<br/><br/>Regarding about Jackson's daring choice to shoot his movie in a relatively new 48 fps (frame per second), I couldn't comment that since I watched this in 2D version. Even so, I notice the 2D version is significantly different than the average 2D version of any movies I have watched before. The sheer amount of color and every visual detail surrounding the movie are significantly brighter and so sharp they make my eyes bleed.<br/><br/>Overall, THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY doesn't exactly reaches the creative heights of what Jackson did successfully in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. But it's still a reasonably exciting epic fantasy to watch for anyway. On the contrary, Guillermo del Toro was supposed to direct this movie and back then, THE HOBBIT was originally split into two movies. It's quite a loss that Guillermo del Toro quit the project halfway after years stuck in pre-production limbo. If he chose to stick around, the outcome would have been somewhat different. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see del Toro's unique take in THE HOBBIT movies. I'm not saying that Peter Jackson is a bad choice for this project. As a matter of fact, he's a perfect fit since he knows the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy like the back of his hand. But returning to Middle-Earth after THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy does have a sense of deja vu experience more or less. Since he's already signed on for the next two movies, we can only hope he'll be improved considerably well in THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG which is scheduled for next December release."

","Just watched it in Bath and loved it!...I was the one with the wooden sword any Bath residents reading this. Anyway,the LOTR trilogy are my favourite films and I've read and loved the Hobbit novel. So yes...expectations were high going in, and expectations were on large met with ease and awesome results.<br/><br/>Yes, many of the problems the reviewers say are true; the story is slow at first, it suffers from minor side story bloat and a few of the special effects are silly and cartoony. But I promise you this, these things are minor and you will not notice them as this beautiful world and exciting story come to life before your eyes.<br/><br/>I watched the film in normal 2D, so I can't comment on the frame rate and such, but it all looked spectacular from what I watched.<br/><br/>It was fun, exciting, tense, interesting and downright hilarious at some points. Many times the cinema burst out with laughter. The bits of the book that needed straight adapting were beautifully adapted and changes were made when necessary. I pretty much universally loved Jackson's changes. The Riddles in the dark was AWESOME!!! Perfection! <br/><br/>Gollum was perfect! Somehow hilarious, terrifying and sad all at the same time. Freeman is Bilbo! End of story. The actor Martin Freeman has to be a cover up. It is Bilbo Baggins doing an amazing job playing Watson, Arthur Dent and Tim. Gandalf was just as great as in LOTR, if not better. Out of the 13 dwarfs we only really get to know Thorin, Balin, Bofer, Fili and Kili. Which is annoying because they are all great. More Dwarfs Jackson! Armitage plays the dark, brooding and yet brave and inspiring Thorin with perfection. <br/><br/>What more is there to say: Amazing acting, writing, directing, scenery, special effects and music (the misty mountains song - wow, I had shivers.) What the hell some of the critics are on I don't know. Not as good as Two towers and Return in my opinion, but it is the first film and it is pretty much on level with Fellowship. Watch it!!! :)"
"isisinhouston","10","3","11","14 December 2012"," Almost Perfect
","I saw this in Digital Cinema instead of high frame rate or 3D. In some places the panoramic views were blurry. The close ups were all very clear and I don't think it detracted too much from the overall experience.<br/><br/>Even though it has been 11 years since the release of the Fellowship of the Ring, Mr. Jackson's makeup artists managed to pull off the characters looking 60 younger with one exception. This film starts on the day of Bilbo's 111 birthday and Frodo is noticeably older. Some things you just can't control. Elrond, Gandalf, Saruman and Galadriel were able to pull it off though. Nothing that really detracted from the film.<br/><br/>One criticism I do have is with a character that they decided to use that had been dead 142 years before Bilbo ran out the door that morning. Azog should not have been part of this story at all but most viewers won't have any idea that he doesn't belong there unless they have read the book and don't know who he was from the other books. That was very unnecessary since there were many other ways it could have been handled. Like the way Tolkien wrote it, perhaps.<br/><br/>Other than having to wait a year for the next installment, my only other complaint is making 3 movies to tell this story. He did add some of the background information that you wouldn't know if you haven't read the Silmarillion or the Histories but did we really need Radagast or the mention of Ungoliant's offspring? Hardly. Again, out of context for the Hobbit.<br/><br/>I did enjoy it and recommend it and unless you are a detail fanatic like I am, you will not be disappointed at all."

He, along with his band of dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf set out on the journey to help Thorin regain his throne and bring back the glory of The Lonely Mountain. Of course this group will encounter goblins, trolls, orcs and wargs but will have a little help along the way here and there from others. In the end of the film they can see The Lonely Mountain - their destination.<br/><br/>I have to say the soundtrack to this film is outstanding... the dwarven songs really stand out!!

","Really sad that Peter Jackson isn't more creative. He basically ruined a perfectly good story by making Gandalf the hero. Bilbo is the actual hero here, but every time he gets into a situation Gandalf magically appears. To many added fight scenes and extra story lines with characters that weren't even in the book. Just another over done movie. I was really sad I spent all that money and time to see it in the theater. If your a true Hobbit fan this movie will disappoint. Aside from the horrible lack of creativity the adventure is fun. The graphics are good. Gollum is awesome, and I was stoked about the Bilbo/Gollum scene. That was one star worth. The rest of the movie is over done. I think Jackson forgot that this is a child's story. The culture today is about shoot them and kill them, so if that is what you are into then this movie is for you. Enjoy I on the other hand will not see the second installment. Overpriced poorly done story telling. Sad he ruined a Tolkien story probably why he never wanted his books sold out to Hollywood to begin with."

I was there on business and through a friend of a friend I landed a ticket. I was in in Cinema 1 of the Reading Cinemas - one of the two cinemas that premiered the film last Wednesday.)"
"saytosandeep","8","2","6","1 September 2013"," MY REVIEW: An Exciting Journey
","Peter Jackson's love of using the cinematic power to portray fantasies is not fantasy in itself. As an expert captain, he recruits the talented team, works on his vision tirelessly, uses advance technologies as the story-telling tools and the results are LOTR trilogy, Kingkong and the latest one is part one of The Hobbit trilogy. Being a prequel to LOTR trilogy, few of the characters are familiar and some of the new characters are also memorable. As expected, the strongest part of the movie is the CGI evil characters and the fighting sequences. You might find slow pacing a deterrent but your patience will be rewarded with winning satisfaction. Tip: Watch it only in HD print."
"TamaraDiazCinematographer","10","2","6","20 August 2013"," Excellent! Amazing! Glorious!
","The most highly anticipated film of the year for me was ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" Everyone in the film crew brought this amazing story to life on film. Being a person who completely enjoys the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"", I can convey that the quality of work that was displayed and executed in LOTR is not only brought on the set of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", but also gives more refinement to the term ""fantasy"" as it relates to the expectations of this genre. <br/><br/>The cinematography is absolutely superb in acquiring all of the angles, camera movement, and depth of field in each scene. The sound and sound effects truly bring us into a fantasy world that is being portrayed in each scene. The lighting design gives us a sense of mystery, excitement, terror, anxiety and wanting more. The overall vision of the film that was directed by Peter Jackson completes the entire film to its glory. The ending of the movie brought on a sense of desire to watch the next installment to ""The Hobbit"". <br/><br/>As a supporter of Peter Jackson, I can only anticipate ""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" to be equally as great as the first!"

","Just wanted to say to everybody who thinks they have ""milked"" the story ore added things that do not exist in the original book. Yes there at lots of things in the movie which you can't read in the book ""the hobbit"" <br/><br/>Tolkien made the book for children well if you have read both the hobbit and the lord of the rings series you will see that the hobbit is far more easy to read. What most people don't know is that Tolkien made a long adult version of the book. That book contains a lot of unknown information about the story like what Gandalf made while he where gone and so on.. that is the only reason why they can make tree movies. <br/><br/>So yea Peter Jackson and the crew have read the long and more detailed book and can add scenes that don't exist in the original book that so many people have read."
"ksj870","9","2","6","21 March 2013"," At last, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings
","Peter Jackson's long awaited adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy novel is finally here, nearly a decade after the last installment in Jackson's magnificent Lord of the Rings trilogy was released to cinemas in 2003. That's quite a wait. The question is, was it worth it? It would be hard to say no. Jackson's film is a fine one, boasting many of the same strengths invested in the Lord of the Rings movies. The script tries hard to capture the vital essence of Tolkien's classic prose, and quite a bit of time is spent developing the story's characters, particularly Bilbo Baggins (the eponymous Hobbit) and a very angry and frustrated dwarf prince named Thorin. The fantasy world of Middle Earth is brought to a wondrous semblance of life courtesy of impressive special effects and brilliant set design, and the many terrific races and monsters of Tolkien's imagination (brutish orcs and trolls, stalwart dwarfs, angelic elves, etc.) are realized so perfectly that it takes almost no suspension of disbelief to get caught up in their otherworldly drama. Acting is terrific, and includes several of the cast from the Lord of the Rings (notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf and, Andy Serkis as the benighted Gollum). Martin Freeman is a fine Bilbo, and captures the conflicted spirit of the little Hobbit destined to redefine the very concept of heroism.<br/><br/>But all the same, The Hobbit is a different animal than Jackson's previous Lord of the Rings films. The tone, for instance, is quite altered. One must remember that the source novel is actually a children's book, and as such rather more lighthearted than the Lord of the Rings trilogy to which it is a precursor. Jackson has to some degree emulated the book's more innocent spirit, and the film has a high humor factor as a result.<br/><br/>The script also incorporates several of the rather silly songs that Tolkien interspersed throughout his books, musical interludes that would have seemed out of place in the darker milieu of the Lord of the Rings but which ring more true here.<br/><br/>More, while The Hobbit includes quite a bit of violence, the action is at times given a more freewheeling, slapstick feel than it ever had in the Lord of the Rings. This doesn't always work, and sometimes matters of life and death come across as merely absurd.<br/><br/>Also, lovers of the book should be aware that some changes have been made. These do not spoil the original plot, by any means, but are designed to strengthen the ties between this film and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They do, however, take that original plot down a few unnecessary tangents here and there, and make for a film that is somewhat longer and more convoluted than it really needs to be.<br/><br/>But if The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not quite as good as, say, The Fellowship of the Ring, it is still a very good film that fans of the Lords of the Rings trilogy and lovers of quality cinema in general should certainly enjoy. And if it inspires a new generation of fans to go back and read Tolkien's inimitable original novel, so much the better."

"cortlahman","7","2","6","7 January 2013"," Bloated but Entertaining
","It seems Peter Jackson could not decide what kind of movie he was making. After leaving the theatre I'm not sure what I saw either. There was a Middle-Earth on screen, but there wasn't quite the same magic that I remember from ten years ago. <br/><br/>The things that were good about The Hobbit can be completely attributed to what Peter Jackson got right with LOTR. Gollum's scene was the absolute best part of the movie. Andy Serkis is great at his craft, and you just can't beat a performance like that. Gandalf was also great as always. All of the authentic location shots were stunning just like in LOTR too.<br/><br/>As far as new additions to the cast go I've got to say that Martin Freeman as Bilbo was pretty spot-on. He was quirky, neurotic and clever like I imagined Bilbo to be. However, not a single dwarf was either endearing or memorable. I felt absolutely no attachment to them, and that's because they were simply too cartoony and one dimensional. This made supposedly tense moments feel more like a thrill ride than a movie.<br/><br/>Speaking of thrill rides, I can't believe that we go from 40 minutes of slow paced introduction in Hobbiton to 100 foot tall brawling Rock Giants. Before The Hobbit started there was a trailer for Pacific Rim, a movie where those Rock Giants would probably be a lot less out of place. I understand that this part is in the book, but to nowhere near the grandeur. Tolkien does not specify exactly how big they were, and I felt that Jackson took some insane liberties here. How can you expect characters in a story to be surprised by anything after witnessing a sight like that? <br/><br/>""Hey look a dragon, Bilbo.""<br/><br/>""Yeah. That's great. Still not as crazy as those Rock Giants, though.""<br/><br/>Remember that one cool scene in The Fellowship of the Ring where they're escaping the goblins in Moria? Aragorn and Frodo teeter precariously on a segment of staircase as arrows are flying by them before they finally topple back onto safe ground. Imagine a dozen moments like that in the span of a minute in The Hobbit. Peter Jackson ramps up the action so much at times that the dwarfs would have to literally be invincible to survive. This unfortunately kills any sense of peril that otherwise should be present.<br/><br/>Visually The Hobbit is good. As much as some people protest, graphics are important in some movies and The Hobbit does not disappoint. However, what looks great as CGI looked a lot better more than a decade ago when Peter Jackson's crew painstakingly made every chainmail suit, and applied all of that make-up to make actors look like Orcs. The Hobbit was borderline Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith with how much of this film was computer generated. Luckily, the CGI is of such a quality that it ALMOST makes up for it. <br/><br/>The Hobbit's soundtrack was superb. I especially liked how they made lyrical songs from the book seem natural and not out of place in the context of the film. A complete far cry from the goofy soundtrack of Rankin & Bass's animated version from the 70s. <br/><br/>I want to end this review on another good note. As much as the Goblin Town part of this movie I felt was a bit overdone, Barry Humphries voice as the Great Goblin was eccentric and pleasantly comical. Oh yeah and the trolls as cockney brigands was sweet too. <br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>I hope there's more good to come from the *gulp*...next two films."

","I went to go see The Hobbit this evening with my mother and I was extremely pleased. As a 22 year old fan of the movie series, I was impressed with the way that the characters I remembered so well from the other films were handled. The scenery was as breath-taking as any of the other series films and provides a wonderful backdrop. The only reason I give this a 9 out of 10 is because of the cluttering of so many characters into one film. I did find several moments of the film to be very comical, but mostly I was glued to my seat waiting to see how the film would play out. This film is a perfect introduction to the legacy of adventures had by Bilbo Baggins and later carried on by Frodo in the trilogy! If you are a fan of Tolkien, or the other films, The Hobbit is a must see!!"

","Brilliant film, enjoyed every minute of it. As a fan of the LOTRs trilogy it was great to revisit middle earth in all its glory. Excellent performances from Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen. Didn't feel that the film dragged at all - found the first 20mins a very good way of setting the scene and developing the narrative in terms of getting to know the different characters. Loved the trolls scene and the goblin king footage. Not sure if the 3D was as good as I would have hoped, but that has been the case with every 3D film I have seen! Music excellent as always - I'd expect nothing else from Howard Shore these days! Personally, I am happy they have made this into 3 films.

"paintingariver","Null","2","6","27 December 2012"," Thrilling and fun, but disjointed plot and characters
","Packed with action, suspense and laughs, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey proves to be a thrilling adventure story--however, the plot feels discombobulated at best. Although The Hobbit is a fun adventure story (as compared to the serious quest of the trilogy), the film adaption has a plot that branches out in too many directions. For example, viewers hardly know which villain on which to focus their wrath--there is the white orc, the necromancer, the goblin king, Smaug and, of course, Sauron. Add to that the frequent sidetracks from the main plot (the brown wizard, for example) and the lengthy amount of time spent in the Shire before the band of travelers begins their quest, and viewers' confusion may well be complete. Another criticism is that overall I found that video game-esque action sequences overshadowed character development and acting potential. Thorin is--by far--the most developed of the dwarfs, but he does not draw viewers into the story as a sympathetic character. As portrayed on screen, there is nothing that sets Armitage's character apart from the typical fantasy action hero--a tough cookie and a bit aloof, but skilled with the blade. He comes off as rather one-sided in his stereotypical strong, silent character. In fact, viewers don't really invest in any of the dwarf characters because their development as characters is discarded in favor of jokes and action sequences. Thus, it is hard to care if they win or lose in battle. There is no sense of urgency or stakes being raised during the quest (despite the ever-present fact that The Hobbit is undoubtedly lighter reading material than the trilogy). If the dwarfs fail, then they simply continue to wander the wilderness. End of story.<br/><br/>On the bright side, Freeman is excellent as Bilbo, though I would've liked Freeman to have more screen time in the traveling scenes instead of the dwarfs and goblins. I hope in the future films he will be allowed more opportunities to act. McKellen does a fine job portraying Gandalf and, surprisingly, lightening the mood on many occasions. Serkis is masterful in his portrayal of Gollum. My favorite scene (besides the hungry trolls and the dwarfs' arrival at Bag End) was Riddles in the Dark. Bilbo and Gollum's game of riddles, fraught with tension, is captured skillfully in this scene. I also enjoyed the many allusions to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, though I hope the loose ends created by these hints (especially by the morgul blade and the necromancer) will be addressed in future installments. I am also glad that The Hobbit has its own musical theme, but still I wish not so much of the trilogy music was used (trying to apply the Gondor coronation theme to a dwarf scene threw me for a loop).<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit is a thrilling adventure, but do not expect it to have the same cohesion in plot and character development as the trilogy.<br/><br/>For more, visit and follow bitesizemoviereview DOT blogspot DOT com."
"dinosaurfour","6","2","6","27 December 2012"," Not quite at the same level as Lord of the Rings
","In all honesty, I was disappointed by The Hobbit. The film didn't leave me with quite the same satisfied feeling as the Lord of the Rings did. Since then I've been thinking of the reasons for this... here are issues with The Hobbit:<br/><br/>I think the main problem with the film The Hobbit is that it is simply not as good a novel as the Lord of the Rings. As well as this, the children's book which Tolkein wrote is not suited to the epic, lengthy adaptation Jackson is creating. This means that, although the film is by no means boring, it seems a little too big for its boots (considering there are two sequels to come). Another issue is the fact that in The Hobbit we have less variation in character, due to the fact there are ten dwarfs, one hobbit and a wizard, instead of one dwarf, one elf, four hobbits, one man and a wizard (a much more interesting mix). In general The Hobbit features less characterisation, less of a storyline and more of a reliance on set-pieces to keep you entertained when compared to LotR. Another quibble I had with The Hobbit was that I felt the music was being reused over and over. Aside from a new theme for the dwarfs it seems little has been added and lots has been recycled from the LotR trilogy. Obviously this is good in a way, as it ties the two films together, but it also feels like a lazy way to go about things.<br/><br/>However, the above criticisms are all made in comparison to Lord of the Rings. Of course Jackson's epic trilogy was an extremely tough act to follow. There are many many good things about the Hobbit, such as the excellent special effects, many hilarious moments (especially with Gollum), some fantastic action and much more. It is a top-notch fantasy adventure film that should entertain all ages. Brilliant additions to the story include an expanded explanation of the Necromancer sub-plot and the introduction of 'Pale Orc Azog', a new figurehead for the ranks of orcs which perhaps lacked a main villain in Tolkein's novel. I am hopeful for the Hobbit sequels, as the story gets darker, and I predict the films will get progressively better."

However, they were based on a 1000 paged book. But the Hobbit is based on a much shorter book. And for that matter, only based on the first 3 chapters.

","It is a fact that Tolkien is the father of modern fantasy literature, through his marvelous work he practically redesigned the gender and served as an example for the entire author community who came after to follow. When I first heard about this movie I was really skeptical, as the original story was a really childish tale and I thought they would not be able to make the feeling of the original ""Lord of the Rings"" get out of me.
But...As soon as the movie started I found myself again as a small child discovering the wonderful universe of books together with the crown jewel called Middle Earth. Even with the adaptations so the movie was more mature were a bit over in some cases, as soon as you hear the poems from the book singed by the dwarfs on a sad tone it is impossible to judge then bad.
The plot flows so well that is can even be seen before than the original franchise by a stranger to the series without losing meaning, they will only lose some really god references. But without a doubt the biggest point of the movie is the fact that is another trilogy, because it shows to the fans that the dream of Tolkien is still alive."

","Peter Jackson's controversial film trilogy of The Hobbit has come and gone from theaters; and now that the dust has settled after nearly four years, An Unexpected Journey is an enjoyable but self-indulgent movie that could have been made into a much more focused and less superficially extended version of the book which it was based upon.<br/><br/>I actually do like The Hobbit Trilogy, but it falls short of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy in so many areas that it's a little sad that the same hands making it couldn't cast the same magic here. Martin Freeman keeps the whole thing afloat with his pitch-perfect performance as the reluctant but lovable adventurer Bilbo Baggins, and Ian McKellen is still wonderful as Gandalf the Grey, still the same awesome wise-old-sage that he was in The Lord of the Rings. The casting helps keep the classic characters from sinking with the rest of the film's fake-extending of 'unexplored' parts in the original novel, which unfortunately does affect a lot of things that don't add to the overall (relevant) story.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson does know how to direct action sequences quite well, and knows when to contrast that with Bilbo's quirky Englishman-esque homeliness and manner, but there was no need for the film to feature foreshadowing of The Lord of the Rings films directly, like having Saruman in council with Gandalf, Galadriel and Elrond at Rivendell before Bilbo and the dwarfs journeyed to Goblin-town? I personally don't think so. It wasn't necessary, or even at all, in the book so why does that need to be here? I guess it was the obligatory run-time. That and the jarring addition of an Orc villain confrontation (we only needed Smaug the Dragon).<br/><br/>If you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings films, this may very well be your cup of tea, or not.

"cmcastl","5","1","2","29 June 2015"," No spoilers here just a very general criticism about Hollywood actioners
","I give this film five out of ten for the excellent CGI for I am a sucker for CGI.<br/><br/>I believe I can pinpoint the problem with the Hobbit as I can some (though not all) of the Steven Spielberg films and nearly all of the George Lucas films - and indeed most of the American actioners since 1914!<br/><br/>If you look up the 'Peril of Pauline' (1914) in Wikipedia you will read an article on the genesis of all modern American actioners, no matter how sophisticated their production values are these days. The Perils of Pauline is one of the primeval actioners. There is no pacing in Perils of Pauline as it is all about how every ten minutes there is an almost insurmountable physical danger or problem for the heroine to solve but that 'in a leap he/she is free'. This appealed to the unsophisticated cinema audiences of the time, which is fair enough when cinema was in its infancy, and they knew that the stunts were real, but sadly still appeals to the unsophisticated cinema audiences of today, worldwide, though they demand, of course, better special effects. <br/><br/>I am not great fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's work - I consider it mythological pastiche - but I intuit he would be horrified at the complete lack of dramatic nous modern cinema directors display in reproducing his work, whether they are American or not.<br/><br/>This legacy, in my humble opinion, which most Hollywood directors have never outgrown, presumably because the films are still so profitable, has disfigured American cinema in this genre for the past century and there doesn't look to be any prospect of it changing in another century."
"tudor-baltoiu","7","1","2","7 March 2015"," It has some problems, but I enjoyed it
","I've been looking forward to this film ever since the word first got out. I am a huge J.R.R. Tolkien fan and I've read the book multiple times. One thing that particularly attracted me to the adaptation is that, at first announcement, Guillermo del Toro was chosen as the director. He is one of my favorite directors and I felt that he will bring a new approach that we haven't seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Then he was replaced by Peter Jackson. I had nothing against this decision, considering that he was the man behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy from almost ten years before.<br/><br/>To start off with, I was somewhat suspicious about the fact that there will be two (later three) films based on a book that is 300 pages long so I assumed that many scenes will be added from other Tolkien works related to the plot. They were also attempting to make the film accessible to those who haven't read the book and possibly even those who haven't seen The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>It is important to point out that this movie, which has a running time of 169 minutes in its theatrical release, covers about 120 pages of the book so it is clear that some scenes will drag on while others were added from The Return of the King appendices and Unfinished Tales.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, for the first 90 minutes there is not much action involved. There are some flashbacks that involve a bit of action, but other than that the movie up to that point is mainly dialog and scenes that are only meant to introduce the characters and scenery to people who haven't read the book.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is excellent. It is wonderful to see Ian McKellen return to play Gandalf and Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins was spot on. However, my favorite character is Thorin, played amazingly by Richard Armitage. I can say that he is the Aragorn of this trilogy and, frankly, the main character of this story. One thing that bothered me is the company of dwarfs. There are thirteen of them but apart from a few, we don't anything about the others except their names.<br/><br/>The musical score by Howard Shore is wonderful as people have expected, considering the fact that he was the man behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy music, which are clearly some of the best film scores of all time. To my mind, An Unexpected Journey is not as great as, say, The Fellowship of the Ring, but it does contain some memorable themes and it makes it a good and pleasant listen.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is somewhat mediocre compared to any of the Lord of the Rings films and some fans might be disappointed. Myself, the only problem I have with it is that it is too long for the 120 pages it covers. Other than that, it has very good acting, very good visual effects and an excellent musical score. My opinion is based on the fact that I've read the book multiple times before watching the film so I had some expectations. However, as a standalone film, it will be entertaining to those who haven't read the book or have no idea about Tolkien's works. Considering all of these, I will give it a 7 out of 10."

","Reluctantly a hobbit named Bilbo leaves the comfort of his own home to go on adventure with a band of dwarfs to reclaim their territory.<br/><br/>Without drawing any comparisons to the books, Jackson's latest venture visually captures the imagination, even though heavily reliant on CGI naturally to tell the story some shots are unnecessary and on occasion distracting for example the rendering of the hares. The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey works best when it's displaying the wonderful landscapes, sets and focusing on the characters interactions.<br/><br/>As a prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy it's notably visually glossier loosing that filmatic like feel. Nevertheless, it is a fine film with fantastic costumes, great writing and a wonderful cast, too many to name, Martin Freeman captures the essence of Ian Holmes Bilbo, notably with the line ""I'm going on an adventure!"" Once again Andy Serkis steals the show as a superior computer generated version of Gollum.<br/><br/>As a standalone film you have to have patience as I can see why a new comer to the series would find the opening plodding, with flashbacks and meetings of off the wall dwarfs. However if you've seen The Lord of the Rings it works better as you are already invested in two of the main characters from the off.<br/><br/>Naturally and unavoidably the narrative is slightly lighter and less grim in tone given the danger and what is at stake compared to the previous trilogy. This aside the journey is certainly worth your time."

","48fps.<br/><br/>The frame rate truly shone in the first part of this trilogy, based on a single book. The scenery was spectacular, with not even a hint of video artifacts, or choppiness. Seeing Gandalf run through the goblin caves swashbuckling his way throughout hearkens back to Yoda in the 'climax' of the Phantom Menace. The story? I am pretty sure there was one in there somewhere, sandwiched between the lackluster attempts at character development. Fight scenes are predictable and none too inspiring. But the budget and the frame-rate, make this worth your while to drop your hard- earned dollars on this cash-grab. After all what is film making except investing untold millions on a vehicle who's sole purpose is to make money. Oh yeah, the 3D trailer for this film was also jaw-dropping."
"tiggerbrunton","3","3","12","30 December 2012"," meh (a reaction I shouldn't have walking out of this film)
","Really, really disappointing. Firstly, I love Tolkien, fantasy and Peter Jackson's work. Unfortunately, I found the Hobbit really disappointing. It's not all bad, but I feel that given the money spent and the people involved, The Hobbit should have been much, much better. Before I go any further, let me add to the praise of the riddles scene. Brilliant and well played. It also looks very pretty. But, the storytelling was sloppy to say the least and lead to a bloated 160+ min where I thought the film was never, ever going to end. The writers decided to chop out parts of the novel and add pointless scenes that 'link' the Hobbit to Lord of the Rings, but really, what's the point? The added scenes were talky, painfully long and stuck out like a sore thumb. All of them detracting from Martin Freeman as the Hobbit, which let's face it, he's the centre of the story and it's his journey we're interested in. The CG stuff was liberally scattered through the movie and seemed like it was there to show a: how clever CG has got and b: how thrilling 3D is. (which it isn't) At a certain point, it just gets annoying and feels like you're watching a poorly made animated movie. The action seems never ending. Each scene seemed to go on and on and on. The film couldn't make up its mind whether it was a kid's movie or an epic and swung back and forth, which only added to the annoyance. This film will go on to make squillions and I'm sure the filmmakers will use that to justify their creative choices, but for my money, The Hobbit is an opportunity wasted. Film making at its bloated, lazy worst."
"marvalyz","7","3","12","21 December 2012"," Setting the stage
","I waited forever for The Hobbit and was one of the first few to catch it on December 13 as soon as it opened here.<br/><br/>First things first, the 48 frames / second really undid the excitement in the first 40 minutes or so adding to the mix those virtually unending scenes & dialogs in thick dwarfish accents & I found myself a bit taken aback. One long , long scene rolled into yet another.Mr. Jackson was indeed extremely generous with the time given to each and every aspect of presentation & I got the impression that somehow he forgot the viewers while brooding over the next fine detail.<br/><br/>Having said all the above, the movie remains a master-piece of an experience with it's stunning cinematography, art-direction & definitely one above in terms of CGI for this subject AND for this age. There were so many scenes which I fell in love with: the trolls rolling, the mountains fighting,the goblins giggling, the Orks gurgling & Gollum with his riddles. But let's not forget that all of this makes up about 40% of the film. The rest 60% is setting the stage for the next two installments which in my humble opinion would present quite a challenge to Mr. Jackson after the shortfalls in the first movie. The main reason I believe is that three movies are being made out of a relatively thin volume of a book. Quite interestingly.<br/><br/>As an average movie-goer I was perplexed by the highs & lows of the movie.But as an ardent LOTR fan & with immense,immense respect for Mr. Peter Jackson, for his passion & dedication to the subject, I have quit evaluating the movie based on the experience which is ""Fellowship of the Ring"" (& it remains an experience each time I watch FOTR). I think my own expectations were over the roof for this one so taking them out & evaluating the movie on it's own merits I can say I look forward to the next two installments as I think they might just turn out to be much better in terms of story telling and audience engagement."
"jcallows","8","3","12","18 December 2012"," More of the same.
","If you've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you'll find this film very familiar. Like the previous three, this film follows a similar plot: to overcome a series of random obstacles to reach a goal. I suppose the same can be said of most films but nowhere is it more clear than in these. And in this film, the simple-minded goal is to reclaim property that was stolen from these new adventurers. <br/><br/>Overall this film is enjoyable to watch and better than most pieces of garbage out there. The graphics is pretty, the action is big and characters are likable. Of course, there is a 'but'. And the 'but' here is that this film suffers from the same two problems the previous Lord of the Rings films had: a disregard for logic and a lack of suspense.<br/><br/>I suppose these two problems go hand in hand. Because if logic was used more I'd be more convinced that the characters truly are in danger and feel greater suspense. But unfortunately there are just too many times I find myself wondering, ""Now that he has this weapon/powerful ally, why isn't he using it/him more?"" Or, ""Why didn't they do this before? It sure would've saved them a lot of time."" Perhaps the book explains the lapses in judgment, but this film doesn't. <br/><br/>Like in the previous Lord of the Rings films, I never get the sense these characters are in any real danger, especially when they always seem to have an ace up their sleeves to bail them out. It seems characters just move from one obstacle to the next. And after witnessing this same ace bail them out time and again, one can't help but wonder, where was he when their home was attacked in the first place? Also, if thousands can't protect their home, how can just 13 reclaim it?<br/><br/>This film, like the previous Lord of the Rings films (and the Harry Potter films for that matter), has a habit of doing something I hate. It does what lousy mystery novels do when they bring out a never-before-seen character at the end and say he did it. Whenever our heroes get in trouble, this film conveniently pulls stuff out of thin air to get them out of it, without any foreshadowing or any hint for us to see it coming. And I hate that. Because no rules have been set. And when there are no rules, anything can happen. It can be an escape tunnel appearing out of thin air or creatures magically appearing to come to the rescue. It's just lazy writing. And I hate that.<br/><br/>Good films set viewers up for what might happen later. For example, in Aliens, we are introduced to a giant robotic machine being used as a cargo loader, so when we see it later, we are not completely surprised. In fact, we are pleasantly surprised and we appreciate its use in a clever way. It's not something that was conveniently conjured up out of thin air because the writer got lazy.<br/><br/>I won't say if anything happens to these characters but I'd be nice and more suspenseful if more characters were hurt or killed. Anyway, despite the flaws in logic and lack of suspense, I still liked it much better than the Harry Potter movies."
"goods116","7","3","12","17 December 2012"," Entertaining but mediocre; never any danger or wonderment
","While I was entertained overall, I found myself bored at times especially during the actions scenes. The CGI has gone too far and poisoned the film making process. The dwarfs and Bilbo are constantly attacked or in peril, but in a very hectic over the top way that conveys no real sense of danger. 1,000 goblins can attack but you know nothing will happen. The Dwarfs can fall 100 stories, but are always safe -- worse, you know nothing will happen. Instead of frenzied, over the top, impossible to believe CGI with things tumbling and high speeds from every direction, it would have been much better for smaller, more subtle battles that perhaps used real stunts and not flooded the screen with tons of fake CGI. It felt more like a computer game at times. Other than that it then felt a bit like a rehash of LOTR with Elrond, Galadriel, etc. The only truly effective scenes were those with Gollum. 7 out of 10."

","The Hobbit part 1 was simply a work of art. One does not simply walk into the theaters thinking that The Hobbit will be like the LOTR series. The Hobbit has so many good things about it I do not even know where to start. My first complaint is the CGI, it is good special effects don't get me wrong but it is just a little to much. Its mostly just during the Goblin Town scenes. In LOTR number one the goblins give off a creepy depressing feeling that really sets mood of being trapped in a mine with no way out. In The Hobbit it almost seems comic like. O My second complaint would be the Battle For Moria scene. That could of been an amazing scene and could have been up there with the Battle of Helms Deep and the Battle of Minis Tirith. Even though I am sure the writers did not want the scene to take attention away from the main story but it could have really made things so much better than what they already were. Other than those reasons my biggest complaint is that I have to wait a whole year to watch the next one. This movie is the start of something good, Peter Jackson did such a good job of turning Tolkiens vision into a reality. If you are into the Elder Scrolls, WOW or anything of the sort I definitely recommend this for you."

","Loved the movie, being a LOTR fan, you should not be disappointed, actually you cannot be disappointed. The story itself is too good to resist. And with THAT cast and director, no way! Anyone else would love too, for such a wonderfully presented film. But yes, one can certainly say that it is touching LOTR's hight, not perfectly equal and higher, which is OK for a LOTR fan. May be, with full trilogy it will be even better, just like LOTR. It is on a bit lighter tone, but in between many a times it touches great hight, and gives us some different space of LOTR arena. Background score could be a bit better. (Surely I did compare it with LOTR, but Guys, let's not compare it with the LOTR's story, it cannot be better than that. Not as yet. Being a different story altogether on the same background, same cast and same director is already a delight to watch. We should be happy that it only does not disappoint on these notes, at least)."
"achyutaghosh","10","3","12","16 December 2012"," Christmas came early :)
","The Hobbit movie review- Expectedly good :)<br/><br/>The year has been sad till date- recessions, fiscal cliffs, unemployment, inflation, and the Mayan predicted doomsday 5 days away. but tell you what, all that does not matter anymore- i am spectacularly happy grinning ear to ear, because The Hobbit not only makes me forget it all and look forward to a better year, even Christmas came early for me, thank you Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>Naysayers be damned but if there was one complaint i had with the Lotr trilogy, it was that large tracts from the book went missing in the film in addition to key figures like Tom Bombadil and Glorifindel- if Potter could stretch to 8 movies, am sure there was enough in Tolkien's magical universe to spawn more than 3 films. it was deep, dark and complicated enough. The Hobbit though is a shorter, less heavy handed and less epically epic adventure- essentially a children's fairy tale involving a group of dwarfs along with a wizard and a hobbit on a treasure hunt, and the beauty of this is that nothing gets omitted from the book, and all the characters are well fleshed out.<br/><br/>""Bilbo Baggins, I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure""- After a 10 minute prologue which effortlessly sets up the world and sucks us in to the story, the movie takes from where the Fellowship of the Rings started, and then goes back 60 years when a young non adventure seeking and home loving Bilbo Baggins is forced by Gandalf to join 13 dwarfs on a quest to recover their lost kingdom Erebor, which was taken over by a fearsome dragon, Smaug who is best described as "" a furnace with wings"". Led by the warrior dwarf Thorin, the Aragon of this story, who is brave but does not often makes the soundest of decisions, this ragged bunch has to battle through every creature abounding Middle Earth including trolls, orcs, goblins, wargs, and rock giants on their quest. At the same time, this is where the fated ""one ring to rule them all"" appears- there is evil brewing in the East, Sauron is rising and the elders are choosing to disbelieve. And Gollum is scene stealing- yes sir, Andy Serkis as the schizophrenic Gollum is back and his scene stealing cameo where he engages Bilbo in a game of riddles and loses his ""precious"" is worth the price of admission- both tense, and funny. <br/><br/>The WETA digital folks have again delivered a stunning film- the imagery, photography and digital work is worth of JRR's imagination. Howard Shore gives another goose pimpling score, and New Zealand never looked so beautiful, like ever. Peter Jackson again proves that only he can do justice to us Tolkeinites- this is a winning formula of expanding prose to stunning cinematic visual, executed with great Ã©lan once again. The star cast is largely excellent, guest appearances by Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, and Hugo Weaving as rock solid, while Ian McKellen, though he looks like he can barely stand, completely owns the character of Gandalf, in addition to an excellent Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Swathes of dwarf make-up cannot take away the beauty of Richard Armitrage as Thorin, and like Sauron in the Fellowship, all we see of Smaug is one fiery eye.<br/><br/>Orcs, battles and plenty of back-story- The Hobbit is mesmerizing in its own way then- it successfully transports you to Middle Earth, the scale and context are not as universe shattering as they will be later on, but then the tale is a lot more innocent and intimate. No grand stand battles, but more edge of the seat excitement. The script is funny, there treatment is familiar- and the result? More of the same that we have always loved. Great family fun and looking forward to the next two parts. Thanks again, Peter Jackson! 10/10"

","Some may regard the following as spoilers!<br/><br/>2012 was an eventful year for any movie lover. The Dark Knight saga had its final movie, The Avengers stunned us with breathtaking action, American Pie offered closure and finally Peter Jackson has come home. In this years, arguably most anticipated movie The Hobbit, we follow Martin Freemans Bilbo Baggins on an adventure that we will not forget so soon. The nostalgic memories of the LOTR movies erupt at the first shot of the Shire, showing the original Bilbo right before the Fellowship, writing his book. From there on its filled with packing action, colorful characters and the stunning patented shots of New Zealand (Which look incredible in 3D). As the movie does follow the structure of the Felloship very closely, the major difference in this is an increase in comedy, which at most times does work just fine, but on occasion does fall flat. But never the less, The Hobbit is a movie event that no LOTR fan should miss, and also those few who have never seen them should give this a try."

For a long time all of Tolkien's books were considered unfilmable. Peter Jackson shows with ""The Hobbit"" for a second time the falsity of this statement. The implementation, the scenes, the characters, everything from start to end was just perfect. Technically, the film forms the very top of the time possible. The animations are more life-like than in any other film before, the scene images and illumination are on a reference level, the performance capture sets new standards and the 3D is on the highest level. But now we come to a point which many people interests, the HFR(48p/sec). From so many people revered and vilified from even more. For me, it's just a new step into the future.

","I for one am one of those who thought that Peter Jackson should have done The Hobbit first or not at all. After seeing this movie I am still of that opinion. The Hobbit is the first of the Tolkien books that I read but it was the LOTR trilogy that I fell in love with. I knew when I heard that Jackson was making this movie that he would have to embellish but I didn't know how far he would go. Others have written that he sticks to the book but on closer examination he's changed the story quite a bit to make it more dramatic for adults. Some of it works and some of it doesn't. The beginning could have been better; too much exposition. I was really a bit disappointed by the Troll segment; this is an important part of the story and I don't think it he handled it very well.<br/><br/>Also I was disappointed with the music. I guess when you have scored so many battles you run out of ideas, I feel for Howard Shore.<br/><br/>Yes there were somethings I liked a lot. Some of the dwarfs are okay and Ian McKellan is always great. Martin Freeman takes over Bilbo very well. Seeing Rivendell again was also nice. Jackson always manages to save himself with a good ending so I gave it a 7 instead of a 5. Here's hoping the second and third (hate that he broke it up into three) will be better."

I did not read the book.<<<<<br/><br/>I give The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey an 8 because I've seen it all before; in a seemingly distant memory a long time ago, in a trilogy made by the very same person behind the camera, only that first viewing eleven years ago took my breath away and this time around I was left, somewhat disappointingly, unfazed. <br/><br/>It's still a masterpiece of film-making and Jackson gets so many things right, like leaving most -if not all- of the things that worked the first 3 movies basically untouched (all the familiar places look and feel exactly like before, the musical score is carefully changed but effectively reminds us of the LOTR trilogy at key moments, no character or performance is out of place, etc) and combines it with new material from this book with ease. Also, he didn't get pretentious, which was my main concern.<br/><br/>However, it dawned on me a couple of times, this thought of the movie feeling almost too comfortable in its shoes, and how easy it must have been for Jackson to build further on the world that he created in the last decade. This can hardly be understood as negative, and yet, it IS where my problem with this movie lies. In a nutshell, everything looked too familiar; be it the majestic scenery with the all 'expected' shots of our protagonists (again) running on mountain tops and through the open fields, or the battles where all the creatures were either seen in a past LOTR or Harry Potter movie. It all gave me a somewhat frustrating feeling of seen-it-all-before-in-LOTR, which started boring me, even when the action kicked in at the end. For the first time, watching a Peter Jackson interpretation of Tolkien left me emotionless. <br/><br/>The LOTR trilogy probably defined the word ""EPIC"" for my generation and in the mean time, we've grown accustomed to other movies catching up -or at least trying to- to the high standard that Peter Jackson bestowed upon us. I guess I wanted him to change just a bit more than he did, I wanted a more distinguishably different feeling of not watching a LOTR movie, but a Hobbit one. <br/><br/>I have no concerns for the other two Hobbitmovies, like before I think mr.Jackson has once again managed to save the best for last."

Absolutely one of the best and most entertaining scenes in any movie ever made. The cinematography is wonderful and creative, but the computer generated graphics appear fake in several parts of the film (human actors have 'too sharp' edges and no depth like they are in front of a green screen, fake looking actor/CGI creature interaction). I saw it in normal frames/sec so perhaps this is better with 2x frames/sec. Some of the fight scenes are way over the top, reminded me of Transformers where they are just trying to show maximum frantic action rather than realistic detail (Orc lair). The makeup on the dwarfs is excellent. Soundtrack fits well, but is predictable. Song sung by the dwarfs was also excellent. Go see it, but not a best movie winner."

Due to the mixed reviews 'An Unexpectede Journey' received, I was rather surprised, when it turned out to be a fantastic film that contained the same mood and the same magic as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy did, and that on top of that it had a freshness and a sense of wonder, that created the illusion that this was our first visit in Middle Earth. <br/><br/>None of the critique aimed at 'An Unexpected Journey' holds water. The cheerful and sometimes goofy humor and lightness of the first film (the dwarfs visiting Bilbo) reminds me of the first 30 minutes of 'The Fellowship of the Rings' (extended edition) - scenes like ""Concerning Hobbits"", Bilbos birthday party, Merry and Pippin stealing Gandalf's fireworks ... and later on the farmer's vegetables. And if we leave out the prologue (about Sauron and the one ring) from 'Fellowship' and the prologue (about the dwarfs loosing their kingdom and gold) from 'An Unexpected Journey', we are left with two structurally quite similar beginnings or introductions, where there is no action scenes until 30-40 minutes into the movie. So I don't understand why some people think, that the beginning is too slow.<br/><br/>One of the characteristic things about The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was the way it lingered at the various locations and persons in several long scenes. The mood and the peace of these scenes (backed by Howard Shore's wonderful music) was part of what made these films so unique. So why are some people suddenly complaining about it now, when they are watching The Hobbit? Personally I love it. <br/><br/>Richard Armitage delivers a nuanced and exciting performance as the dwarf prince Thorin Oakenshield. Martin Freeman is funny, but at times also convincingly serious and expressive as the reluctant, inexperienced Bilbo. And Ian McKellen is once again impeccable as Gandalf the Grey; no one could have played this role better. They are all amazing actors.<br/><br/>The story is simple, but very funny and riveting and ultimately quite emotional. I loved the cinematography and the music. (In the cinema I watched it in 2D and 24 fps, which it is how films should look.)<br/><br/>'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a flawless masterpiece. I enjoyed every moment of it. (I prefer the extended edition.) I expected nothing and got EVERYTHING my heart desires."

","When I heard that they were making a trilogy out of The Hobbit, I groaned. I expected a slow, boring, movie that would murder the book, despite it being from the producer who did The Lord of the Rings so tastefully. How wrong I was. From the inspiring lines by Bilbo, and the action scenes that put you on the edge of your seat, to the absolutely stunning graphics and cinematography, and the laugh out loud moments with the dwarfs.this film has lived up to the rest of the series and is a must see.<br/><br/>The only thing that would, in my opinion, take away from this film is the fact that Jackson played with the movie a little to much. For example, Galadriel is never mentioned in the book, yet she was the first cast in the movie. Also, the scene where the mountain giants are battling never happens. If they had taken that film time and gone in-depth about something else in the book, I feel it would have been a great improvement. <br/><br/>All in all though, this film has lived up to the rest of the series and is a must see."
"pattonmaster","9","2","7","23 April 2013"," This is how Peter Jackson should have done Lord of the Rings
","I want to start off by saying that I am a Tolkien purist. I have read the Silmarillion. I have read The Hobbit twice. I have read all three books of The Lord of the Rings thrice. I use words like thrice. And I have even read the appendices written by Christopher Tolkien; the books on how the books were *written*. I am a huge fan of Tolkien, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to the movies made by Peter Jackson. Honestly, I don't understand why this movie was panned so hard by critics. All I can say is, if you didn't like the movie, you're going to hate the book. Aside from one or two discrepancies, this movie is pretty much on par with the book.<br/><br/>The way this movie started out was great, with old Bilbo Baggins finally beginning work on his book, There and Back Again, a Hobbit's Tale. As he works on writing his book, we see the city of Dale followed by a detailed tour of Erebor in all its grandeur. I did not see this movie in 3D, but I was still blown away when I first saw Erebor on the big screen. It was a work of cinematic brilliance. Everything about Middle-Earth in this movie was great. It was like the fantasy world we all want to visit.<br/><br/>One thing I love about the Jackson movies is the casting. Everyone in these films looks the part, but the best casting choice beside Christopher Lee for Saruman was Richard Armitage for Thorin Oakenshield. This is exactly how I pictured the king of the dwarfs rather than the stereotypical garden gnome design. Ken Stott as Balin was a perfect choice, and I was glad to see that many other actors had reprised their roles from Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>What I loved the most about this movie was that it elaborated on many things that weren't explained very much in the book yet would be important in the Lord of the Rings. Best example: the Necromancer. Many people who haven't read the Tolkien books see this scene as pointless, but it is a very important scene as the Necromancer is in fact Sauron. The council scene between Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman is a crucial scene as is essentially sets the stage for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Some other minor scenes from the book are extended a bit and I will admit that in some cases it is unnecessary, but this hardly detracts from the rest of the experience.<br/><br/>But of course there were discrepancies. The biggest one was with the pale orc, Azog the Defiler. In the book, Thorin's father, Thrain, slew Azog at the battle of Moria and it is Azog's son, Bolg, that is hunting Thorin. However, I find it easier to overlook this discrepancy as even bigger and more blatant mistakes were made in the Lord of the Rings movies and those movies were still great.<br/><br/>This movie is the epitome of a Tolkien book done right. I loved every second of this movie and I look forward to the next two movies."
"louis_sound","9","2","7","21 March 2013"," No LOTR copy, but a highly original, true-to-the-story adaptation
","The first return people were expressing was that ""it isn't anywhere near as the Lord of the Rings"". This is a logical conclusion, to some extent, seeing as Jackson is once again present in the party (thank God) and seeing how The Hobbit is the prequel of the Ring movies.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the sheer comparison between the two literary works and their visual counterparts is obnoxious. I say this because the Hobbit was - as Mr Tolkien himself pointed out - meant to be a (although not juvenile) children's story, whereas the Lord of the Rings was a fully-fledged epic fantasy tale.<br/><br/>Let's jump to my (totally biased of course) opinion. In spite of this difference in purpose, the atmosphere in both stories comes astonishingly close. Never had I expected Jackson to pull that one off. Secondly, it stays true for the larger part to the original story, which I consider a big virtue. Thirdly, the first part can be compared to the Fellowship, in that its pace is yet building, slowly but steadily. Connoisseurs are aware of the fact that the second and especially the third part will know an enhanced velocity. This may shun the action-seekers or casual fans.<br/><br/>The movie is nothing short of enthralling. Bilbo's development and the character in all its quirkiness, combined with the dwarfs' steadfastness and stoutness and to top it off the wizard Gandalf's wisdom and wit make for a highly interesting tale, full of peril around every corner.<br/><br/>Take a look at this movie if the LOTR movies was your cup of tea."

","Not quite the same bawling my eyes out epicness of the first three, but this was a good movie.<br/><br/>Good acting, incredibly beautiful scenery, good story (I didn't really like the books for these movies), good writing, good choice for actors. <br/><br/>Loved seeing the old characters and the old actors make their appearance from the original. <br/><br/>And sometimes, it was very silly. <br/><br/>It still had me cheering at the end just like the first three did. <br/><br/>Definitely worth the money. Can't wait for the next one.<br/><br/>Hollywood needs more fun, and less copies of old stuff already done, if they will only recognize that fact."

","I watched The Hobbit: An unexpected journey (2012) and I am confused that the movie is better than LOTR or not, after some time I realized The Hobbit is a different kind of movie as we comparing to LOTR, because it kind of serious type movie and a good one we all know about it. But when we are talking about The Hobbit it is a good adventure and full of enjoyment, you're never getting bore till the movie is gonna end. <br/><br/>Their are very interesting characters in this movie like Balin,Dwalin, Bifur, Bofur, Fili,Kili and Radagast for sure. This movie is never get you bored and it has good plot too. This movie has beautiful colors, cinematography, directing is just awesome and inspiring thumbs up for Peter Jackson thanks for making this masterpiece. <br/><br/>This is the epic movie and best yet in adventure and fantasy genre. Peter Jackson is make another epic trilogy but far different from LOTR there are some weakness and strengths of this movie. <br/><br/>Strengths <br/><br/>1. Never get you bored come to the point from the first scene. <br/><br/>2. Good effects, directing,acting and adventures plot.<br/><br/>Weakness <br/><br/>1 Looks like a fairy tale not novel based movie. <br/><br/>2 Lack of action and war scenes.<br/><br/>But this is just one sided weakness not big, though the movie is awesome and Actors gave peerless performance like Martin Freeman as young Bilbo and Richard Armitage as Thorin. This movie has beautiful visual effects, animations and it is a complete dose of an entertainment. So, I suggest all of you to keep calm and enjoy this movie. <br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson make another good movie it is different from LOTR but a good one and Howard Shore's music make you calm and you loved all the background scores of this movie. <br/><br/>I gave full marks 10/10 for this flick and can't wait for next two parts The Desolation of Smaug (2013) and There and back again (2014), its becoming the best trilogy of this decade for sure, just looking forward to both parts."
"mirpaulick","10","2","7","19 February 2013"," ""The Hobbit"" Movie Review
","Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" may be the most captivating adventure movie of 2012. Based on the novel by J.R.R Tolkien, ""The Hobbit,"" takes viewers from grass plains to a rocky mountain pass; from the rolling hills of The Shire, to the waterfalls of Rivendell. On the journey, many trials are overcome by one courageous hobbit, a safeguarding wizard and thirteen unique and lively dwarfs. Every aspect about ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" from the exceptional acting to the fresh and flawless animation and scenery, creates an enchanting adventure for the whole family.<br/><br/>Anyone that can empathize with the overwhelming fear of leaving the comfort of home can relate to the timidly brave hobbit, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). Freeman adds to Bilbo a special innocence and peculiarity that makes his character ever so rare. Sir Ian McKellen plays, in my opinion, one of the most memorable characters in cinema, Gandalf the Grey. McKellen is surrounded by an aura of wisdom. He provides good hope to every trial the clan encounters and always seems to show up just when he is needed most. The leader of the thirteen dwarfs is Thorin (Richard Armitage), the grandson of the dwarf king. At first, Armitage gives a darker and unwelcoming persona to Thorin; unlike the rest of the dwarfs who are rather merry with a rough around the edges feel. Together, the company creates an entrancing connection that brings viewers along for the journey. <br/><br/>While most movies based off of books are somewhat of a disappointment to the reader, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is pleasantly almost spot-on; right down to Tolkien's poetry. The first movie, of the trilogy to come, begins with a background explaining just why Bilbo Baggins receives fourteen unexpected visitors. After a night of convincing, Baggins decides to join the dwarfs in regaining their kingdom Erebor from the fiery stronghold of the dragon Smaug. Although the plot of facing one adversity after another may seem habitual, the originality of the characters and situations create excitement around every corner. My favorite scene introduces the internally troubled and misunderstood Gollum (Andy Serkis). While Serkis' voice is a talent in itself, he also kindles a complicated compassion for Gollum. The filming and acting of the riddled scene is engaging and pulled me in entirely. <br/><br/>Unlike the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" has less graphic violence and a little more child reared humor. The orcs and goblins are still the most disgusting creatures I have ever seen. All the same, middle earth -- and all its inhabitants -- is a beautiful imagination brought to life. One example of the phenomenal filming is the ability to show the height differences with Gandalf towering over the short dwarfs and even smaller hobbit. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is most definitely an adventure for all ages, that is, if children can manage to sit through a two and a half hour long movie. <br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" creates a new world, one even different from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Reappearing is the classic ""Concerning Hobbits"" lullaby that touches the heart no matter how many times it's played. Without a doubt, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a magical film and magnificent start to yet another trilogy that will encourage anyone who watches it to let their imagination run wild through the fields of fantasy."
"galenolds95","10","2","7","5 January 2013"," Excellent
","As if the Lord of the rings series couldn't get any better, Peter Jackson manages once again to deliver s stunning masterpiece. The scenery chosen was perfect and went hand in hand with the book's tone. The casting director makes perfect choices in choosing which actors will play each character. Howard Shore also does an excellent job by giving a soundtrack that adds extra suspense and/or thrill to certain moments. This movie was so good I can't imagine what will happen with its subsequent sequels. I give this movie a very exceptional 10/10 and would recommend it to any casual movie goer who's looking for a movie with a perfect blend of story elements and good-paced character development. This movie will surely be joining my collection when it comes out on DVD."

"bluesman-20","Null","2","7","31 December 2012"," Let me tell you of the days of High Adventure.
","The Hobbit is more then the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series. It is a movie of Derring Do and high adventure. Sword and Sorcery at it's finest. The Story is changed from the book but it adds something to the movie. the Tolkien Hobbit had other elements that served his story well. But they would not translate well onto the screen. Peter Jackson's Adaptation changes aspects that enhance the story. The Story is told from Bilbo's point of view as he writes of his adventures to Frodo. We go from Ian Holm and Eiljah Wood reprising their roles as Bilbo and Frodo in a cameo. Then we go into the story where Young Bilbo is reintroduced to Gandolf and Gandolf decides that Bilbo is too concerned with his own comforts. So he gets Him involved in a adventure for his own good. the Adventure Gandolf gets him involved in involves dwarfs wanting to retake their ancestery home from the dragon that slaughtered their ancestors and King. Now they wander homeless and Kingless going from country to country doing odd jobs and fighting wars for pay. The introduction of this brotherhood to Bilbo is worth the price of the ticket as Bilbo gets culture shock. And finds the courage to go on a adventure something no respectable Hobbit would ever do.<br/><br/>The Acting is top notch. A lot of the actors reprise their roles and step into them like it was yesterday. I saw the 3D imax version and that's the best way to get the full scope of the beauty of the film. The Film is a treasure of sight sounds and images and imagination. Grandour on a Epic scale. If you loved Lord of the Rings. You need to see this."
"julian-mumford","8","2","7","15 December 2012"," A very different adventure
","In an ideal world, The Hobbit would have been adapted, screened and served as a suitable hors d'oeuvres before the main event, the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy.<br/><br/>In the real world, ""The Hobbit"" has to follow the groundbreaking and much loved LOTR films, which is a different and altogether more difficult proposition. Essentially creating a prequel, that by definition portends dark deeds that have already been revealed and comprising a much lighter, more humorous tone than the later books.<br/><br/>We open with a brief prelude in Hobbiton with the aged Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) finally revealing his earlier story of how he came by the ring to Frodo (Elijah Wood). Moving back in time we meet the younger version of Baggins (Martin Freeman) who takes the story forward.<br/><br/>Gandalf (Ian McKellen) has decided that Bilbo is the most suitable candidate to assist twelve dwarfs in their quest to reclaim their homeland stolen from them by the treasure loving dragon Smaug. Bilbo is reluctant, he leads a very settled conservative life, with a full larder, doilies and a treasured dinner service collection.<br/><br/>Dwarfs like to party and much to Bilbo's horror, the house is soon overrun with much eating, belching and portentous singing. Eventually, despite his initial misgivings, Bilbo finds himself quite literally part of an unexpected adventure.<br/><br/>The story is well known to many and is too complex to recount in a short review. Fair to say that elves, goblins, orcs, trolls and eventually large spiders and dragons, together with other assorted fantastical creatures, all form part of the story as the quest progresses.<br/><br/>Whilst wizards and fantastical lands are now stereotyped, mainstream and frequently parodied, this is where the template was set. Many have followed and arguably bettered JRR Tolkien's stories but these are much loved and any tampering will answer to a massive and vocal fanbase.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson returns to Middle Earth as director, despite initially declining and it is hard to imagine any other director handling the material as sensitively and confidently as he does here, together with his trusted producers and screenwriters.<br/><br/>The film starts slowly and teeters perilously close to being twee in places, notably the washing up sequence at Bagend and Radagast the Brown (Mccoy) reviving hedgehogs before driving a sled pulled by rabbits. Jackson flirting dangerously close to ""Never ending story"" material, that may have certain demographics seriously wondering when the next orc battle will start. Some judicious cutting in the films length, may well have been possible here.<br/><br/>The story starts to come to life the moment the dwarfs fall down a crevice, directly into a fight with the goblin king, which leads to Bilbo's first meeting with Gollum (Andy Serkis - motion capture). The sequence with Gollum is worth the price of entry alone, Serkis continuing his wonderful recreation with even more facial and physical expression than before, iconic cinema in the making with Jackson allowing the scene room to breathe. Ultimately, Bilbo's actions or in fact failure to act, will have a profound affect on the later story.<br/><br/>Technically the film is a marvel, sweeping panoramic battles, first person perspective runs through fantastical detailed underworld settings with believable yet simply impossible chase and escape sequences. Orcs and goblins are dispatched with wild glee, censors kept at bay with a lack of (red) blood. The dwarfs played by well known (full size) actors (James Nesbitt, Richard Armitrage to name two), who interact with seven foot wizards and small hobbits all without issue, Jackson using a variety of techniques to make this world work. Mention must be made of the make up and costumes on display, each dwarf is a masterpiece and even in HD, stands up well to closer inspection. Finally, Howard Shore's epic score, again complements the action with variations upon the well known central theme.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen brings Gandalf to life once more, Freeman does confused, yet earnest better than anyone and particularly excels in his scenes with Gollum. Hugo Weaving and Cate Blachett make welcome returns, Blanchett sharing a gentle well played scene with McKellen, an indication of why they returned to their roles and speaks volumes to the depth of the characters friendship.<br/><br/>Liberties have been taken with the story, with some additions to enliven certain sequences but all within the spirit of the story, that even the most traditional of Tolkienists may find hard to fault. Jackson makes extensive use of New Zealand's wild and untamed South Island beauty, augmented as before with state of the art CGI work.<br/><br/>As most will know, the story is now set to become three films and so this first outing must come to an abrupt stop and so it does but in a suitable place and with a great line ""I do believe the worst is now behind us"", related without a trace of irony.<br/><br/>There is more humour, a lighter tone which aligns with the original story, which some LOTR devotees may find this hard to accept but overall this is solid entertainment. Following a shaky start the film finds it's stride and provides the audience with a rousing second half, complete with some of the best orcs and wargs yet seen in the series.<br/><br/>3D adds depth and the high frame rate version seen here does provide an immersive experience, whether this works well with live action and is less ""cinematic"" is still open to debate. <br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>It is difficult to believe any other director could have brought this story to life with such sympathy, care and love as director Peter Jackson and his team.<br/><br/>That the film does fall short of the beloved LOTR trilogy is almost to be expected. However, despite some early misgivings, this sets the scene for a continued adventure that most will enjoy and continue to cherish.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

There's just way too much of it.<br/><br/>There are great moments (Riddle me this G Man) and it does still manage to enchant in cinematography and score, but you can't help feeling that with a bit of disciplined ""Sting-style"" editing this could have been another Fantasy masterpiece.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see the Dragon though..."

Glad to have seen it and looking forward for the next two movies. It has a solid base!<br/><br/>I totally loved the allusions to Lord of the Ring, even if only LOTR fans can recognize them, especially with the Necromancer who is Sauron himself.

"Dr_Coulardeau","7","3","13","22 December 2012"," The novel WAS a masterpiece
","The psychology of the characters is very often reduced to some simple sketches that are more part of the costume the actors wear, part of the characters and not something having any depth, any contradictory inner voice. Even the Hobbit himself is rather sketchy. He is predictable. He is in no way moved by deep sentiments that are expressed in a way or another on the screen. He does not have time to do this since he is absolutely all the time taken in a wild action that has no pause whatsoever, reducing the dialogue to nothing most of the time, grunts and growls most of the rest of the time, and here and there a few words often spoken in vain. <br/><br/>And that is the main characteristic of this trilogy. <br/><br/>It all starts with a Rune written on the Hobbit's door by the wizard on his first visit. This Rune is ""Fehu"" under its Germanic name or ""Feoh"" under its Anglo-Saxon name, and it is not reversed. But we are not explained the meaning of this Rune. The basic meaning is ""cattle"" which relates it to the post ice age agricultural evolution, the domestication of the wild bovines and thus the evolution of that new species that will provide food and comfort to human beings. It is easy to understand then that it means ""wealth"" and all that can be derived from that concept, such as '""fulfillment,"" not only the satisfaction of one's hunger, but also the satisfaction of all basic needs and further on the satisfaction of one's call to the wild and adventure. This is basic in the whole vision provided at the beginning, though it is not explained clearly and it is not explained again at the end when the Hobbit arrives home and finds out all his accumulated wealth has been sold to everyone who wanted it. Satisfied in adventure and fate since he fulfilled his destiny, he is totally ruined in his material possessions and his house has been legally and commercially looted. That's the kind of meaning we do not get and that's how we can say that this rune represents this motto: ""Every beginning has within it the seeds of its own end."" And the seeds can be the negation of the beginning, or its reversal because a Rune can always be drawn upside down, reversed.<br/><br/>In other words it is perfectly representative of the ambiguity of runic culture, the very culture Tolkien is looking for in his novel. This ""fehu"" rune is the symbol of the call to some fate that leads to a dragon through fire, seas, storms and all other dangers from armies and other species and the ""fehu"" destiny is to kill the dragon. The killing of Smaug was contained in that rune written on the Hobbit's door by this visiting wizard. I did not find one moment when this was explained. You can tell me that's the whole story. Sure. But in Tolkien's mind and in his creations, there had to be some pondering and understanding of the ambiguity of these missions and of their greatness in their being ambiguous, hence requiring at any moment, at any step a resourcing of oneself into the power of the mission, into the blood of the dragon. <br/><br/>But my main criticism is that action is made dominant. There is nothing but action, meaning danger and violence. Even the Orcs must have a mind and must have some psychology. They are reduced to an army of brutal and brutish automats, the perfect killers who cannot die, though on the screen quite many will die at high speed.<br/><br/>This insistence on the warlike aspect of the story erases the magic of the wizard and even the courage and imagination of the dwarfs and the Hobbit. Then it is all special effects that are supposed to be so striking that we are stunned into deafness, which explains why there is no dialogue. Why should there be in a story that is reduced to calamities and military fighting with in-between all types of other fighting, always for life, always to death. And the thirteen original dwarfs, squared up by the Hobbit who makes them fourteen, and the wizard who makes them fifteen, will only be ten left squared up to twelve by the Hobbit and the wizard. And that dozen is of course so symbolical of perfection that we cannot in any way hesitate: we have reached salvation though there is no prophet, no God, no Son of God, no Holy Virgin either. This parable of Christianity does not find the religious and ritual dimension it could not ignore in Tolkien's world. This film is alas absolutely deprived of any religious and spiritual dimension.<br/><br/>If you like special effects, that's your trilogy. If you like spectacular battles, that's your trilogy. If you like simple people who do not question the universe too much, that's your trilogy. And to make it square: if you like films that do not contain anything erotic, sexy or even simply fleshy, hence if you like puritanical human beings, that's your trilogy.<br/><br/>It does not matter if Tolkien is betrayed in this trilogy, since Tolkien's son made a tremendous amount of money. To defend himself he explained that he had donated a lot to various charities. Good for him. But Tolkien, his father, deserved a better service, more spiritual, more inspired by love, friendship and empathy instead of the light sprinkling of these seven and a half hours with rare and extremely superficial and evanescent references or simple allusions to such human feelings, certainly not actions or behaviors. The dragon is beautiful but he is absolutely unlovable, and actually unhatable because one cannot hate something one does not love.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","As a long time fan of Tolkien and reader of The Hobbit, I was somewhat disappointed.. Why all the fillers? You don't need them, the book is exciting enough as it is. You could cut about 20 minutes and I would be a much better movie. And you don't need three movies, two would be sufficient. Oh well, at least they didn't butcher it. But still, when I think about it.. It feels a bit like a ""family"" movie, to bright and friendly. Would have enjoyed a much darker and mystical The Hobbit... But! Still a good movie, I give it 7/10 for good effort.

","Peter Jackson's The Hobbit has been a source of talk as many looked forward to going back to the Lord of the rings realm (Middle Earth). Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit which happens to be one book, Peter Jackson is going to take one book and turn it into a trilogy, this movie alone seemed a little too long, and there was a time when I actually got tired, so I do hope the others are not going to follow suit.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me more of the fellowship of the ring, first there is the gathering of the people that are going on the ""Journey"" then there is the long wait while others in the various realms are briefed of the ""Journey"", then there is the journey itself, although the Journey differs from the quest of Frodo and Sam but we are being briefed with the incidents that led to what in the ""Fellowship of the Ring.""<br/><br/>Many after watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy went to go read the book, and like me, many discovered that there was a journey before The Lord of the Rings. How Bilbo came about the Ring and how insignificant it was in the book the Hobbits only to become overly significant in the remaining three books of The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>As a prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy it does have many of the old cast from the trilogy showing up, we get to see Old Bilbo, Frodo, Elrond, Gollum, Saruman the White and Galadriel, all this were played by the same cast from the old Trilogy.<br/><br/>Set sixty years before the events of The Lord of the Rings, this is a tale about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is asked to go on an adventure by a wizard, Gandalf the grey (Ian McKellen). The adventure will be one in which he will accompany thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug the dragon. <br/><br/>The thing about our return to Middle Earth is the scenery, the CGI is just too beautiful to overlook, the cinematography was just one thing, the blend between the characters and the scenery is another, this movie is a sight for sore eyes. You can tell right away that this is going to be a huge financial success.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen, playing Young Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey respectively are the characters to watch out for in this flick. Then there is the point when all the boring talk and all the waiting brings you to, the battle between the Dwarfs and Gandalf vs the Goblins, that is where you will see CGI at its best, the Great Goblin was so ugly that seeing him alone can cause an heart attack. The battle to get away from the Goblin is one that will make you respect the visual art and effects that are put into these movies.<br/><br/>My general consensus is; this is a good movie, a little too long though, but it is good to watch.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","I am a fan of the previous 3 lord of the rings movies. The hobbit however I have mixed feelings for. The first hour felt like I was watching a B grade fantasy movie. The camera work and the overall feel of the movie didn't site right with me.<br/><br/>Just a note... I walked out of the first cinema as it wasn't in HFR 3D (high-frame-rate 3D) and was almost un-watchable with lots of movement. <br/><br/>The second half though reminded me why I loved the first 3 movies... polished, great action scenes and the CGI improved a lot. Its not at the standard I expected but hey its more of the fantasy world that I enjoy so no regrets..."
"girolimetti","9","3","13","15 December 2012"," Ignore whoever tells you HFR is a bad thing
","This is more a review of the new format, rather than the movie itself.<br/><br/>You should really ignore whoever tells you HFR is a bad thing. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie in 3D HFR. There was no motion-sickness or any of that nonsense, and my dinner stayed where it belonged. The 48 FPS made this the best 3D I have ever seen, easy to follow, very immersive, you can notice the tiniest of details, no flickering, stuttering, shaking, blurring or any of the problems you would experience at 24 FPS. 24 FPS was first used in 1927, I don't know why they didn't think about increasing the frame rate before. I think 48 FPS is here to stay, and I am going to enjoy it :)"

","So I wrote this once, and it said that I didn't have enough lines. So I'm writing more. However I will try to stay on topic as much as possible. In the beginning, it was very loud. The intro was an interesting twist from the first movies and starting with Bilbo's book. I think that they could have put more imagination into the story instead of just copying from the book. The use of animation and graphics were way better than the original Lord of the Rings, and it seemed as if they too filmed in New Zealand. I'm not a big movie buff, and this is my first review, but I have to admit, I'm liking this. The plot was wonderful, and the tale epic. The use of the old characters was genius and after affects was mind blowing. I knew it would be good, but I never expected this good. There were a few concerns, mostly concerning violence and bloodshed. It seems that, as Lord of the Rings, this too contains fierce battles and lots of death. Great work, you should definitely go see it. My favorite part was the song, it was inspiring and very creative. Great work guys."
"bofur29","10","2","8","1 August 2013"," Best movie of 2012!
","The ""critics"" are completely wrong about this movie. Has any one read their reviews? None of them make sense! They should be commenting on acting, directing style, screenplay, etc... not whining over and over ""it's SO long"" This movie had great acting, from the three main characters and all the supporting actors too, good humour, awesome action scenes, a very well written script and plenty of dramatic, heartfelt scenes- not just pointless action/explosions like most blockbusters. DO NOT listen to critics- the audience score is more like it (although I give it 100%). The acting was one of the strongest points. Freeman is perfect as timid, unadventurous everyman Bilbo. McKellan delivers another top notch, nuanced performance as Gandalf. I also really enjoyed Barry Humphries' performance as the sick, delusional Goblin King. Nesbitt and Stott stood out among the dwarfs, but all were great. Richard Armitage in particular was mesmerizing in this film. A much better version of Thorin than the book. Three high lights of the film were the riddles in the dark (gripping, intriguing, and also humorous), the final warg battle (the best action scene of 2012, it was so intense!), and a scene in the mountain cave where Bofur confronts Bilbo about leaving the company. It is so touching and sad, and the look on Nesbitt's face and the way he says ''We don't belong anywhere."" is truly heart breaking. Another high light is the two songs the dwarfs sing in Bag End. Granted it is a little long, and to a non fan the beginning may seem a little slow, but the time flies by, especially if you pay attention to the lovely character development going on in the opening instead of impatiently waiting for them to leave. The score in this movie is also brilliant, particularly 'Over the Misty Mountains'. If you want to see a great movie that blends hilarious humour, heart stopping action, interesting characters, a timeless story, and emotional drama, watch An Unexpected Journey! It is my favourite film of 2012 and completely equal to LOTR!"

","When i went to see this film i was a bit apprehensive because i didn't want them to mess the hobbit up like they did with the Lord of the Rings by missing out great chunks of the story. However they kept to the book almost 100%. It was superb! I was so glad Peter Jackson decided to stick with the book this time and he even integrated parts of the appendices into the book as well which is fantastic. The only fault which I can pick from it is that for some reason they choose Azog instead of Bolg to be the named villain. I say this because Azog was killed so why did they bring him back to life? <br/><br/>The cast was perfect in the hobbit. Martin Freeman played Bilbo Baggins excellently, there was no fault with his acting at all. You had many familiar faces from the Lord of the Rings back to reprise there roles in the hobbit. Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Andy Serkis as Gollum and the prolific actor Christopher Lee as Saruman.You had many new faces as well to play the roles of the Darwves and for me James Nesbitt was the best playing Bofur.<br/><br/>This first film finishes with them being carried away by the eagles due to the close shave with Azog and his orcs which was the perfect place to finish the first film. The special effects and CGI (especially with Azog and Gollum) is world class. No film can match them.<br/><br/>I cant wait for the second and third part of this franchise to come out and if they keep to the book like with this one then they will be highly successful and more importantly great films."
"officefan01","8","2","8","23 February 2013"," What's with all the hate?
","First of all, I'm not too big of a fan of The Lord of the Rings. I say that because I have never read the books but the movies are fantastic and I was very excited to see this. But then I heard all of the negative reviews and I was worried. I went in not really expecting much, but I felt it was almost as good as the trilogy. First off, the performances are fantastic, especially from Martin Freeman, Andy Serkis and Ian McKellan. Everybody else is fantastic in the roles. I also liked the comic relief in the movie, as I felt that the first trilogy was a little too serious at times. But don't worry, it isn't like the Star Wars trilogy at all. At least The Hobbit's tolerable. Also, I know it's almost three hours long, but it felt like an hour and a half. Any movie that can do that is good in my book. The scene between Gollum and Bilbo is also worth the price of admission alone. But like most movies, it's not perfect. While I enjoyed the comic relief at first, it did get old by the middle of the movie. But if you love The Lord of the Rings, just go in and lower you expectations a little bit, and you will enjoy it."
"ssconviction","10","2","8","20 February 2013"," Great Fantasy Movie
","The movie is amazing. It is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a cinema. The vividness of the colors and light and movement is something to behold. And then the 3D takes it all to another level. It was a little unnerving at times. Almost as if I was watching a hybrid of a movie and a live action performance.<br/><br/>The scenery is, of course, gorgeous. The acting is light, fun, playful while also managing to stay true to the original story. There is a little too much of the side stores for my liking. And it could well have been cut by a half hour or so and still not lost any of it impact and appeal.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is a revelation. Knowing him from The Office (I lived in the UK for a while) it hardly seemed plausible that he could carry off such a role, but he is very believable. The merry band of dwarfs are well played and you somehow get to know each of them by the end of the film. The special effects are, well, special. We were ducking as rocks and boulders came flying out at us and I swear there was a bird floating over our heads at one point. The surround sound was rich and evocative of the caves and the music is lush and emotional.<br/><br/>As for the main story, well, apart from doing a prelude that reprises the role of Frodo and older Bilbo Baggins, it pretty much stays true to the text - with some audience members anticipating what the characters were going to say next.<br/><br/>A word of warning - some of the battle scenes are very intense, made more so by the 3D and high definition used along with the sound effects. You may want to think long and hard about taking young kids to it."
"fluidce","10","2","8","5 January 2013"," best film of 2012
","What can I say? I was blown away by this film -and I went in expecting a lot, after the success of the LOTR trilogy. It is definitely worth it to see this film in IMAX 3D. The scenes are beautiful and the cg is flawless. The music in this film is also noteworthy. A lot of it keeps with the original themes used in the LOTR trilogy creating a sort of familiar and cozy feeling for the viewer. The song the dwarfs sing around the fire was done so well it made me want to go buy a pipe and sing around a fire in a hella deep voice with a bunch of dudes. There is also a lot more action in this film compared to the LOTR films. It is quite violent at times and pretty graphic (heads/limbs being lopped off, stomachs being slashed, etc.). In my opinion it was all done in good taste. It's not like in Game of Thrones where you see a guy get sliced and then his intestines start pouring out. Martin Freeman's performance was nothing short of impressive. He plays the perfect Bilbo Baggins- the one I remember reading about in the original novel. He gives a very convincing performance that really gets the audience to relate to, sympathize, cheer on, and even laugh at his character. I cannot wait to see the next one that comes out. Everything else in my life is really just a magazine in a waiting room until it comes out! I'm JK. Not really though. OMG I CANT WAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTT"
"robmercer-1","9","2","8","4 January 2013"," More beautiful and exciting that I could have imaginedn
","Was shocked anyone who likes LOTR would not like this as is evident in some of the reviews, but I am heartened that the overwhelming majority thought highly of this movie. Perhaps if you had a very pre-conceived idea about what you thought the movie should be you might be disappointed but you can never really go to any movie with that attitude (unless you directed it I guess).<br/><br/>I thought the story of the Hobbit (as compared to the LOTR) would not make for quite so spectacular movie but I totally underestimated Peter Jackson and his crew. They turned this lovely little story into a grand and exciting saga with a perfect combination of familiar themes coupled with enough new stuff to make this truly a worthy successor to the LOTR trilogy. It would have been tough getting the story just right for the screen but they have certainly done it here.<br/><br/>I have always preferred the Hobbit's story a bit better that the LOTR trilogy as I felt it focuses more on the little people (figuratively and literally) and relies less on the melodramitic kings and queens and the end of the world stuff you usually get with most fantasy. I find this more interesting. Just a rollicking grand adventure.<br/><br/>Gives us something to look forward to at the end of each year again."
"jellydoughnut2013","9","2","8","3 January 2013"," Better than Return of the King
","Finally made time on New Year's Day to see this film, and was not disappointed. As with many other people, I wondered how Mr. Jackson could make a three part movie out of one book, but I am very anxious to find out after seeing The Hobbit. Thought this was better than ROTK and they gave that an Oscar.<br/><br/>Loved the scene in Bilbo's house when everyone came for dinner. The choreography when they were cleaning up after dinner was really cool. I thought that seeing only glimpses of Smaug was a great idea. It's going to be a 'holy crap' moment when we do get to see him for the first time. Fight scenes were epic and loved that Bilbo got the courage and helped save the day. Loved the cliffhanger type ending.<br/><br/>I think there is a lot of Oscar potential for The Hobbit. I give 9/10 because nothing is perfect, but this is a really awesome movie."
"bjornbouterse","10","2","8","2 January 2013"," Here we go again
","I have just returned from my seven o'clock showing of this fantastic film in dazzling 48 fps in 3D. This film successfully manages to turn a fairly short children's book in whats going to be a epic trilogy. This is no better than TLOTR but no worse either. It gets into the action fairly quickly. And keeps the story solid. I don't normally say this but the critics are very wrong this time. This film should not be faulted for its humour or light touch because thats what the Hobbit is about. Its supposed to be more light hearted than TLOTR. But doesn't seem it. However the goblins and orcs are done very well it almost looks like they have made them look slightly less scary and frightening. This might just be me, but its very well done if it is. All the characters are accurate and well portrayed. For me the 48 fps and 3D kind jumped at me all at once and in some of the action scenes looked slightly too busy. But other than that, the best picture I have ever scene on screen.<br/><br/>This may seem strange but I have only just actually taken to Peter Jackson's epics. But now I am in love with middle earth. I would easily rate this film a 9 but because of Bilbos sake a 10. Enjoy!"

But anyways it is not up to me if kids should watch it. why I'm saying it was good until the end is (spoilers) it ended by Gandalf healing Thorin and everyone was happy and they were back on the adventure then it takes us to Smaug and wakes up and the film ends.

","I love the lord of the ring movies. I still remember my feeling when I saw the first LOTR. That is why I went to see the Hobbit. However, I was a little disappointed.The whole storyline does not flow fluently as LOTR did; and sometimes I just lost in the side story and forgot about the main theme. I love Throin and Fili/Kili, but I did not think Dwarfs get enough character development except Throin. In fact, I only remember Throin as a live person with a temper; other dwarfs, except Kili, do not manage to distinguish themselves to me. The only reason I remember Kili is because he is handsome and he uses arrows.<br/><br/>The little hobbit, which is supposed to the main character, does not get my attention either. Although PJ gave him a lot story, the character was not well developed and changed abruptly several times. I did not see what suddenly convinced him to take the adventure and did not understand how he became so brave to save Throin at the end of the movie. I did feel Throin should be able to protect himself in that scene.<br/><br/>I may go to see the latter movies for the sake of actors, not the expectation of story."
"steve0557","8","2","8","30 December 2012"," ?
","The Hobbit Trilogy! Really!? I can't imagine how hard-up some Hollywood movie makers must be to stretch a single book into three separate flicks. Good viewing? Absolutely. But all the eye candy in the world doesn't compensate for the fact that this is milking a text for all it's worth. Literally. I mean after all this a story that most of us Tolkien fans have read at the least a half dozen times. Has it taken any of us more than a few hours at most to get to Esgaroth? I really don't have anything else to submit. I did not do any research prior to going to the theater to avoid spoiling the experience. Suffice it to say, for me, it was a surprise ending. Will I dole out another 26 bucks (given the price of movie ticket doesn't go up, yeah right) to see Smaug finally get it? Of course I will. Does this ridiculous treatment of a classic irk me? You bet."
"piratecannon","8","2","8","29 December 2012"," More of the Same?
","I'll be honest; though I greatly enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies upon their release, they never really enveloped me in quite the same way that the original Star Wars or, say, Back to the Future trilogies did. When the announcement came that The Hobbit would also be receiving the Jackson treatment, I was excited for one specific reason: I absolutely loved the book. It's a relatively brief experience, one in which I presumed the now well-known director would be able to spin into one helluva knock-out return to Middle-earth. Imagine my shock when I learned that the book would not be made into a single film. In fact, it wouldn't even be split into two; instead, three was the magic number. Because of this, my excitement about The Hobbit quickly waned, as it seemed that I was in for an unnecessarily prolonged cash-grab that had the potential to (very) quickly outstay its welcome.<br/><br/>Thankfully, The Hobbit isn't nearly as tedious as it could have been. From time to time, the feeling that things are being stretched a little thin is tangible, but, for the most part, it's a stirring, gripping adventure. The movie also does a nice job of connecting itself to its predecessors (or should I say forebearers?), and the introduction of the principal players is both whimsical and wrought with a sense of impending danger—something that adds needed weight to stakes that we, as an audience, know will ultimately be resolved (this, I think, is the primary curse of prequel feature films).<br/><br/>Any other criticisms that I have come in the form of many of the movie's more intense moments and how they're worked out. My memory is hazy regarding the film's source material, but many pages were clearly taken out of the LotR playbook when it seems ""all hope is lost,"" and though this sort of reminiscence will certainly bring a smile to the faces of fans, it would have been nice to see the movie do something a little more aggressive to try and separate itself from the original series.<br/><br/>It's clear, however, that Jackson still loves Middle-earth and its inhabitants, and it's a virtual certainty that the remaining films will be welcome excursions. Here's hoping that part two of this particular adventure will be both tightly wrought and surprising in equal measure."
"sissonsk-550-381706","3","2","8","27 December 2012"," Meh!!
","Welp, I guess as a movie, the Hobbit was okay. If you're a fan of the LOTR flicks then you'll enjoy this film. If you haven't read the book, you might possibly enjoy it. The Hobbit starts of strong and it actually followed the flavor of the book. I actually thought that Jackson was not going to butcher the story. I'm not a purest but movie's based on books should follow the story at least a little. Riddles in the Dark was completely screwed up and turned me against the film. This was one of the defining points in the book and Jackson could have easily stuck to it and kept the Movie interesting (possibly more so). I can forgive most of the rest of the film and I understand Jackson trying to keep it in line with LOTR. But it should be said that this movie was loosely based on the Hobbit and if you love the book you will probably hate this movie."
"rlparrt","10","2","8","25 December 2012"," Complicated
","It's complicated. I think all of the casting choices were spot-on amazing, especially young Bilbo and Thorin (I intend to follow the actor's career for so long as he has one). I think the cheap laughs and bogus cameos were indeed cheap and bogus.<br/><br/>The Hobbit could have been made as a rollicking epic of a four hour film. It's a small book. I promise, it really is! Instead it's slooooowed down to a three part monstrosity of epic slowness!! Also...I think the exploration of various character motivations went badly awry here. Not just that they differed from the book, but that they differed badly. No one was looking to defeat a dragon; the dwarfs only wanted to pilfer from the hoard, hence why they're hiring a burglar, not a dragon-slayer. Thorin never apologized to Bilbo until the End. BUT that scene was pretty damn amazing to watch nonetheless. Bilbo exhibited far less martial prowess in the books, which wouldn't be such a sticking point, except...it's why he returned home the way he did - still a good person. He didn't kill a lot, if really any. Basically, these individual examples don't matter, except that they demonstrate an ongoing and unfortunate misinterpretation of the text, especially regarding why characters do things.<br/><br/>The need to give a face/name (white orc) to the otherwise faceless menace known as orcs or goblins is less troubling. The need to include the other wizard...sadly stupid. The fact that the Eagles didn't talk...probably for the best.<br/><br/>Overall, I will always be elated to see anything Tolkien in the mainstream cultural arena. I just wish it were better."
"nualasutton","8","2","8","17 December 2012"," A great return to Middle Earth
","First things first, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not meet that ridiculously good standards of any of the Lord of the Rings films. But it is still awesome in its own way, and frankly I would have been surprised if it was as good as any of the LotR films. Whereas LotR was on an epic scale, this film is on a much smaller scale compared to the impending doom of all of Middle Earth. But that isn't a detraction from this film at all, The Hobbit AUJ is a great film in it's own right and deserves the good reviews it's been getting. The humour of the film is done brilliantly, genuinely funny in parts, especially in the sequence with Gollum. A lot of people have said the pacing of the first hour is slow and could easily have been cut down, it could have been I suppose but I enjoyed getting to know the dwarfs and Bilbo. Okay they sing a song whilst washing up, but that sequence shows us how they work as a team and the bond of the dwarven company, and also brings a sense of fun - which is perfect as it's adapted from a children's book, so there should be humour and lighter moments in it. One of the things that wasn't so great about the film was definitely the CGI, particularly on Azog the pale orc and that baby hedgehog. I was quite disappointed with that, as in LotR they used makeup and prosthetics on the Urukhai, etc, so they could have gone down the same route in this film, especially as they did the big bad guys so well that way in LotR. Another thing was that I wasn't sure why exactly Radagast was around and felt he could have been taken out with no problem, same with the appearance of Frodo (especially now Elijah Wood's voice has deepened noticeably, which jars as Frodo isn't meant to have aged.) But, the action sequences were exciting and enthralling, particularly the rush through the goblins' lair. Martin Freeman made an amazing Bilbo (possibly the best thing about the film), the scene with Gollum was utterly brilliant and although you don't get to know each and every dwarf very well, Peter Jackson still manages to make you fall for their quest and puts you firmly on side with them so you really want them to succeed. Can't wait for the next two films, and eventually one day a marathon weekend of all three Hobbit films followed by LotR the next day!"

From beginning to end, i couldn't take my eyes off the screen, The music gave me chills down my spine like it did in the Lord of the Rings and this is the best example of how a 3D movie should be.

","Well, to begin with - this movie is for those who just hadn't had enough of the Middle-Earth adventures with the almost 10 hours saga of LOTR. And I am one of those. For the non-LOTR hardcore fans, it's like the movie being too long, being dragged or just piling on the LOTR popularity to mint money from making a trilogy out of a 19 chapter book.<br/><br/>On the story line, The Hobbit takes you 60 years back before Frodo's venture to Mordor began. With the ever-inspiring Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) recruits Bilbo (wasn't impressed with Martin playing this character initially, but turns out he fits quite well) to a team of 13 dwarfs set to reclaim their lost home encountering orcs, goblins, trolls, the ol' Smeagol, the Ring & more to come. Starts lil slow at Bag'end, the pace then picks up once the journey begins leading to some intense chase and action sequences.<br/><br/>On the technicalities, the 3D instead of being a distraction here, its actually quite effective and has got impressive clarity too (supposing its coz of the high frame-rate 3D 48fps). Thumbs up to Howard shore for the epic music plus a mention for the haunting Richard Armitage ""Misty Mountains Cold"".<br/><br/>And Peter Jackson - you are the guy for Epic Movies, not for some family tragedies. Good to see you back.<br/><br/>The only disappointment being a year long wait for ""The Desolation of Smaug""."
"loganboy","7","2","8","15 December 2012"," Dazzling and Fun
","The key to enjoying this movie is this: don't compare it to The Lord of the Rings. Yes, I understand that this is technically a prequel to one of the finest film trilogies of all time, so it's quite hard to take it as separate, but if you can, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great movie experience. Filled with heart and humor, action and gorgeous scenery, this movie will displease few viewers, most of which will be those who expected it to be superior to the Oscar-winning The Lord of the Rings. Martin Freeman puts on a lovable performance as Bilbo Baggins, which only adds to the charm of the movie. I only have two major complaints: one, it's massive runtime can feel a little tedious, and two, the constant use of special effects in the orcs, goblins, and whatnot sort of gives the movie a synthetic feel. Criticism aside, I'd recommend this film to anyone with that inner-kid, waiting for a marvelous adventure. One of my favorite moments in the film is one that might otherwise be overlooked - the scene where Bilbo runs after the dwarfs and yells to his confused fellow hobbits: ""I'm going on an adventure!"" So he does, and he takes the audience with him."
"rosborne979","8","2","8","14 December 2012"," Slow but steady
","I was interested in seeing this in the High Frame Rate format, and only High Frame Rate showing I could find was also in 3D so I took that one. <br/><br/>The movie was very good. I found it a bit slow in the beginning but detailed in its telling of the tale. It picked up nicely from the middle to the end and left me looking forward to the next installment. <br/><br/>As before with my other 3D experiences, I find the 3D effect more annoying than beneficial in any way, and an overall detriment to the film. <br/><br/>In addition, I also found the HFR aspect uncomplimentary to the overall experience. The HFR is very nice in action scenes or sweeping vistas or CGI, but it's very annoying in all the small intimate scenes. Many scenes of the movie felt like I was watching a soap opera on TV, it had that weird ""cheap"" look to it (even though I'm sure it wasn't cheap at all). Also, the added clarity just serves to expose the imperfections in the set and the makeup and background. The human eye is very discerning to subtle things and with such high clarity I found a lot of the scenes to look strangely artificial. There were several instances where it felt like I was watching a play on stage rather than a movie on a screen, and I didn't like that. Plays are one type of experience, but films, especially modern graphic laden, visual films are supposed to be an entirely different experience. <br/><br/>When it comes to the story and characters and acting and sets and such, the movie itself is on part with the first installment of The Lord of The Rings which I also enjoyed. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing the Hobbit again sometime (before it leaves theaters) in good old high quality digital and 2D."

","It begins with a prologue (featuring Ian Holm and Elijah Wood, both looking rather waxy) that accomplishes very little other than delaying the start of the real story. This is followed by an incredibly lengthy introduction to the dwarfs, including the ostensibly heroic Thorin Oakenshield. After our hero (Martin Freeman) initially demurs (eating up more running time), he goes on an adventure, which includes, among other ""delights"": - A wizard with what appears to be bird dung on the side of his head; - Said wizard giving a hedgehog a contact high; - Said wizard riding in a rabbit-driven sleigh, which could have been effectively whimsical if the context weren't so dull; - Cameos by many of the major players in Lord of the Rings, for no very good reason; - Jarring colloquialisms like ""It tastes like chicken"" and ""Out of the frying pan, into the fire""; - A major climactic battle fought in large part with flaming pine cones; - A vengeful orc with a metal claw for a hand, whose other noteworthy characteristic is paleness; - Slenderman (I think); - A goblin king who looks like Planetship from Battlefield Earth; - A lot of jokes, few of which are particularly funny; - A lot of dwarfs, few of whom are particularly well-defined as characters. <br/><br/>I could also add that Thorin Oakenshield was boring and unlikable, that Bilbo seems to disappear or is relegated to the background for sizable stretches of the film, that the special effects were shockingly weak at times, that virtually no one involved seemed to be passionate about their job, that the script was a lumpy mess, that Howard Shore clearly didn't put much work into writing any new music... <br/><br/>But I'll skip all that and just say I was very bored."

This, of course, must materialize in the sad reality that we SEEM to be left with MORE of that which is JACKSON, and LESS of that which is TOLKIEN (since JACKSON's FILM versions are notably rife with plot bloating additives, and TOLKIEN's versions are notably elegant, and expressed in the form of a consummate mastery expressed in narrative skill).<br/><br/>...That having been said, yet another beloved Tolkien classic - ""THE HOBBIT"" - has been wrested from the elegant prose of the inimitable TOLKIEN to the cinematic exaggeration of the all too predictable JACKSON.

"MovieloverIreland","7","2","9","2 January 2013"," A mixed bag
","Problems:<br/><br/>1 : Ragadast the brown. This character was terribly misjudged, was Jackson hoping to cater to a younger audience ala Jar Jar Binks. In my experience comedy relief characters never truly work in big films and the only relief here is when his scenes are over. I mean who wants to see a hippy old guy with bird droppings caked on his face riding a sled pulled by giant bunnies. I had to check my drink to see if it had been spiked by LSD. Get lost Ragadast!<br/><br/>2 : The Goblin King. This testicle chinned Jabba the hut wannabe is not the slightest bit scary. First impression of him was that the rendering could have been better, I saw this movie twice in cinema, firstly in 3D 48fps and then in 2D and The Goblin King looked noticeably faker in 3D 48fps. It also annoyed me when he started a sing a long. Stop singing you fat fool, it feels like I'm watching a Dame Edna cabaret show. Heaven forbid.<br/><br/>3 : Unnecessary characters. old Bilbo, Frodo, Galadriel and Saruman had no need to be in this movie and I challenge anyone to defend their scenes as essential to plot. Ian Holm and Christopher Lee look so old and rigid its as if they have a team of puppeteers just moving their facial features and its really sad and distracting. Why have them in it? Did Jackson just want the gang back together for old times sake. These scenes should have been saved for the extended editions which begs the question what will be in those editions? Will we get a sequence where Gandalf has a bit too much to eat at the opening meeting in Bilbo's and has to rush to the bathroom and is too big for toilet bowl and blocks it in a scene reminiscent to Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber. Perish the thought.<br/><br/>4 : Galadriel. This character is utterly useless, she just stands around posing. She cant even walk because she will trip over in that long dress. Then she tells Gandalf if he needs her help to call her and just disappears from shot. Where did she go? Did she hide behind the pillar? Makes no sense, if she can just transport around the place at will then why didn't Gandalf call her for help when they were in peril at the end instead of sending a bug off to get giant Eagles. Galadriel is as much use as a glass hammer.<br/><br/>5 : Trolls. Tom, William and Bert. I mean really? Tom, William and Bert. Are they tax accountants, sesame street puppets or trolls?, awful names for threatening characters. That whole sequence irritated me, felt like something out of a Narnia movie, too silly and lame comedy.<br/><br/>What was good?<br/><br/>1: Gandalf. Ian Mckellen is fantastic as usual, every time he appears on scene its like an old loved friend returning.<br/><br/>2: Thorin = total bad ass <br/><br/>3: Gollum. Steals the whole movie with the riddles in the dark sequence that is compelling to watch. Gollum is scarier than he was in LOTR, cant fault this scene.<br/><br/>4: Music. I enjoyed Howard Shores score, its not as memorable as his LOTR score but he does the best of what he has to work with and the main dwarf theme is suitably rousing, I also loved his music used when the Eagles arrive and rescue our heroes.<br/><br/>5: Final showdown, I was gripped by the tree top escape from Azog and his wargs, I felt real emotion there, it felt like the old LOTR movies and I was captivated and didn't want movie to end from that point.<br/><br/>Overall: I did like this movie, it entertained me."

","I watch movies for the visuals as much as the story and I used to think there was no such thing as too much action but this film changed my mind about that. The types of movies I most like to watch seem to have entirely too many drawn-out fight and chase scenes these days and this one takes the cake! The first LOR was amazing and I've enjoyed all of them--even this one--but I grow weary of films that primarily consist of action scenes interspersed with clever dialog and imagery when it should be the other way around. It might have been better if it were shorter in length. The visuals were amazing and I've never felt dizzy while watching a movie before this one, which I'm not sure is a good or bad thing but it was kind of cool. I was exhausted after watching this film and felt like it didn't get very far. I am tempted to give it a six but my feeling is that any film with an IMDb rating of ""7"" is worth a watch and this film is definitely worth a watch but I have no desire to watch it again, unlike the first LOR."

","I've seen it three times now: first in 3d 24f/s in french, second time still in french in 3d 48f/s and finally in English. All i have to say for the 3d version is that we truly have some really great experiment when we see the 48f/s: so yes, we have to adjust first because the images seem so fluent, like some real life shooting, but when we obtain an amazing deepness in the footages and we can actually have the time to register with the corner of our eyes every details from the ""nature"" kind of scenes to the ""combats""'s ones. Some might feel dizzy but, as for everything, you adjust easily! It's actually the second best 3d i have ever seen.<br/><br/>Then, if you are a fan of the books, the first trilogy, the Tolkien graphic universe, you will have a bit of a disappointment because yes we will recognize elements from the first trilogy (quotes, natural geography,winks...)giving us a strong impression of déjà-vu! But, because we know the involvement of Peter Jackson and his previous crew on the others films, we naturally trust him again to give us a wonderful show: from the story to the editing, the visual effects to the score reviving the old themes, the old crew and the news ones, we can acknowledge some genius work... And just try after all, for a moment, to forget all footages you have ever seen about the Middle Earth and his characters and benefit from a fresh point of view!<br/><br/>Like others, i had doubts: one tiny books but three films? Commercial envy? Hubris to bring back success? Yes we could have had something great with Guillermo del Toro (co-credited for the scenario before leaving the adventure), but are we not secretly (or not) enjoying the fact that once again he is the leading captain? We cannot deny that we are definitely attach to that Middle Earth and Hobbitts or Dwarfs are truly coming to life. By the way, Martin Freeman is adjusting perfectly in the younger shoes of Ian Holm when Richard Armitage is finally managing to obtain international interest becoming a deeper and darkener Thorin than in the book.Not to forget the entire dwarfs fellowship, the crazier than ever Gollum, and the frightening bad guys (make up or digital).<br/><br/>Being fair, it's not the best film ever but you have every ingredients to tie us up to our seats: at every moments of the movie, you will find yourself caught by one element in particular. And after the nearly three hours and the credits when you could have recognize the names of so many who have worked on the LOTR, you will tell yourself: ""OK, i forgot what it was more than 10 years ago when we have to wait for a whole year and here we are again, already growing in anticipation""!"

I haven't read the books so I assume at some point they will face the dragon in some form. The poor bad guy should use all that gold in the dwarf citadel to buy an LCD, see the 1st movie, open the hidden gate, roll over and die.

","Yes, it's not quite as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy and probably a bit too long, but I still thought it was awesome! Technically and visually, the movie is a marvel, and the many quieter character moments worked really well, too. The returning actors do great work and I enjoyed Martin Freeman's Bilbo a lot. And Gollum, who looks even better than he did in the previous movies, is a particular highlight, of course. If I have one major criticism, it's that during all of the spectacular, roller-coaster-like action sequences, there is never any sense of peril or stakes. Despite the fact that the big set-pieces look like there's no way anyone could survive them, none of the countless dwarfs are ever harmed or killed, which makes the whole thing feel awfully ""safe"" after a while.<br/><br/>And by the way: count me as a big fan of 48 fps (or HFR). The clarity and the amount of detail is amazing and the lack of motion blur really helps with the 3D and allows for very fast-paced editing and hyperactive camera-work without ever looking messy or jumbled. I think it's totally worth seeing it that way, despite some minor problems (a very ""digital"" look during the more brightly-lit scenes in the beginning, some movements that seem weirdly sped-up)."
"as-armada","8","2","9","17 December 2012"," Great film, but too attached to the LOTR trilogy
","OK, I can start by saying that this film definitely is a must see for every (or not) fan of the Tolkien universe, but, this time Jackson is abusing from his success of the LOTR trilogy. There are too many obvious connections between these films, that The Hobbit loses some of it's ""fairy tale"" original author's intent. I'll recommend this film over and over again, but again, as a Tolkien fan-atic, I miss the little Hobbit tale..it relies too much on the past films, and I don't think it should be like that. The Hobbit had a great potential even without all this stuff brought back again... The thing that leaves me with a question is: if LOTR book is a 3 hours each film trilogy, and it's a 1500 (ca) pages long, why the hell The Hobbit should be as long as that? Now it seems sort of offending to the greatness of LOTR, to put 9 hours of a new trilogy in a 300 pages (ca)... IMHO..."
"cutfieldt","10","2","9","16 December 2012"," Worth every second
","I made the mistake of reading many reviews prior to watching the movie and as a result my expectations were low. After watching the movie though I am left in awe and am eagerly looking ahead to part 2.<br/><br/>The HFR creates a whole new level of viewing for the audience and that to the eye surpasses the leap from from DVD to Blu Ray. Those left criticizing appear to me now as the same dinosaurs which appear when ever an industry takes a revolutionary step forward.<br/><br/>The dialog pays tribute to the English roots of Tolkeins novels and as such is requires a rather dry sense of humor, it is a far cry from the more American humor to which we are accustomed too. For me this was a plus but that may change due to personal taste.<br/><br/>I have also read many critiques of the additional material not directly from the novel. The material though is not largely not fabricated by Jackson and his team but rather is additional material from Tolkeins works. This may seem like over kill but anyone who has read his novels I am sure is aware of the in-depth web of relationships which even if not referred to tend to play a significant role in the outcome. Effectively Jackson has simplified the journey by ensuring the audience can build a greater understanding for the characters.<br/><br/>I feel the need to remind people this is a fantasy movie and the fighting scenes are meant to have an element of the surreal. Few people complained of such during the LOTR but after reading the reviews here it seems they were expecting something which is overly realistic. This is based on a child's novel though so just enjoy the show.<br/><br/>I rated it 10 out of 10 purely because walking out I was left wishing I could go straight away to see part 2 and lets face it if you want to do that after nearly a 3 hour movie the director has done a lot right."

","12/16/2012 I saw 'The Hobbit' today in 24 FPS and 3D. And I was honestly blown away. This film was great in every aspect. First I would like to say that I've read many reviews of The Hobbit and all of them complain about the length of the beginning and how long it takes to get into things. All of the reviews are wrong. The beginning was necessary to help us take in the new world, but so familiar that Peter Jackson and crew has brought us to again. Being a big of the books and franchise of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, I was in awe and grinning the entire movie. The Hobbit is an exceptionally different movie than The Lord of the Rings. The movie has a lighter tone and has a lot of CGI that LOTR did not have. And when I first heard of this, I was disappointed, beings that most of the Orcs and Urak-Kai were real actors in LOTR. But, when I was watching the film, all of these worries washed away. I found myself not knowing if they were real or not the CGI was so good. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an amazing film, that is so different from The Lord of the Rings, in many ways, and that is not a bad thing, at all. This movie brought me back to the Middle-Earth that I fell in love with years ago, and at the same time, showed me a totally different world, I have never seen before. Cannot wait for the next two movies of 'The Hobbit' trilogy."
"cattjones","8","2","9","16 December 2012"," Good Film; A Bit Long
","Sir Peter Jackson is really trying to keep the franchise going with this prequel to the Lord of the Rings films. I saw an interview with the cast on some morning show and it is just hard to believe that all the dwarfs are over six feet tall. I think that the CGI in films continue to improve and I can't imagine what they will have in store for us in the coming years. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm,old Bilbo) wanting to document his unexpected adventure so that he will be able to share it with his young friend once completed. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) sets off on his journey to help the dwarfs, led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) regain their homeland. Along the way they run into various mini-adventures and have to fight their way through the landscape. Anyway, there were a lot of familiar faces in this film; even Elijah Wood (Frodo) made a brief appearance at the beginning of the film. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) are among the cast of characters returning to the film. Speaking of Gollum, I think that there were some scenes in this film that were entirely too long (e.g. the riddle scene by the underground lake). My favorite character in this film (and all the films is Gandalf (Ian McKellen). He always seems to show up just when you need him and when he does, you know there is about to be some awesomeness on the screen. I think that the thing that surprised me the most was all the singing in the film; I didn't see that coming. I did enjoy the ""rock"" fight.. trust me; it is not what you think. It is evident at the end of the film that there will be a sequel to this prequel; so get ready for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Smaug (by the way) is the name of the fire-breathing dragon in the film. I only hope that this one will not be another butt blister film. I could hear the kids saying that they thought this film was awesome after it was over. I thought that it was pretty entertaining and the film itself was beautifully made. I just wish that it was not almost three hours long. I almost gave it an amber light just for that reason, but I am going to go ahead and give it a green light. ""Lord"" lovers will definitely like it."
"khfan250","8","2","9","16 December 2012"," Jackson's Return to Middle-Earth is a Glorious, Albeit Lengthy, Trip
","Anyone who knows my taste in movies knows that I usually favor the fantasy genre. Heck, I even gave a positive review to this summer's ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". But, and I know many out there agree with me, the crowning achievement in the fantasy genre is Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"". Each film was superbly crafted, with practical effects and great casting that will make it stand the test of time, much like Lucas' original ""Star Wars"" movies.<br/><br/>So, like many people, I was pretty excited for ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"". I didn't like the fact that a 300 paged book was being split into three movies, because I knew that a lot of things were going to be stretched out far beyond their natural length to ensure a 2 hour and 45 minute length. And there in lies my biggest problem with the movie; why does it need to be this long? ""The Hobbit"" is a completely separate entity from ""The Lord of the Rings"", both tonally and scripturally.<br/><br/>The casting is solid, with Martin Freeman playing an excellent, energized Bilbo Baggins. The dwarfs, while funny, were sort of forgettable, though I expect we will get more development from them in the next two movies. And even some of the characters from ""The Lord of the Rings"" appear, whether they are minor cameos or are involved more intricately with the plot.<br/><br/>As I said before, I was very impressed with the practical effects in the previous trilogy, so I expected more of that in this movie. And while some of it is practical and effective, too much of it is CGI. And that just looks out of place, especially in a Middle-Earth that is so fresh in everyone's mind.<br/><br/>Final verdict: The movie is too long and too overindulgent to be a great movie like ""The Lord of the Rings"", but it is a good movie. I didn't get the chance to see it in 48fps, so I can't judge the film on that basis. I just hope that Jackson can either better utilize the length and pacing in the next two movies or just make them an hour and a half, because the length is really the biggest problem with this movie. Still, it's a good movie that should be experienced in a movie theater."
"reznor94","10","2","9","16 December 2012"," Critics were wrong!
","Prior to my viewing of The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey, I had read a significant amount of professional critics, eager to know if the movie's quality would live up to the quality of its predecessors, the Lord Of The Rings. I have to admit that I was starting to lose hope to see a movie that be equal in quality, and therefore I was discouraged before even entering the movie theatre. Walking out of the theatre, all I can say is that I am glad I was completely wrong. <br/><br/>First off, one the critic's main complaint was the slow dragging pace of the movie. Let me correct this...in my opinion, the pace was as it had to be. OK, perhaps I am not the right person to give my opinion on this matter, as I always find delight watching the tremendously long extended editions of the LOTR (approx. 4 hrs long each). Therefore, I had no problem with the pace... The amount of detail shown to the viewer is considerable. As a consequence, you really get to put yourself in the character's shoes, which is makes the pacing an acceptable sacrifice for the people who find the movie too long. <br/><br/>In addition, many critics have mentioned that the over-use of CGI was giving the movie a very fake look. Let me reassure you, they are wrong. Yes, Peter Jackson uses quite a lot of CGI. The orcs who were once real actors in costumes, face full of make up, are now all computer generated. However, they do not look fake in any way. On the contrary, the CGI is so advanced nowadays that they look very real. Many would not see the difference, since they have the same hideous faces, the same movements and they portray the same amount of terror. Sadly, there was one CGI character that does looked fake, and this is the great white orc Azog. Yes, the chief of the orcs is the only character that does look fake, but a movie can't be perfect, right? To conclude this matter, CGI does not give the movie a cheep feel. <br/><br/>Finally, the last complaint critics had about The Hobbit was the 48 FPS. OK, this is a very personal opinion. Personally, I had absolutely no problem with it. At first, it can be slightly distracting. But the human eye adapts very quickly, and after the first 10 minutes or so, you barely see the difference. It did not give the movie a fake look. To be honest, I did not identify the fake noses of the dwarfs of the paintings of Rivendell. On the contrary, it provided the 3D and landscape's a crisp and beautiful image like you have never seen before. <br/><br/>To conclude this review, I have to say I was astonished by the masterpiece that Jackson delivered. 10 years later, it felt great to finally be back to Middle-Earth. Pacing is as it has to be, the CGI looks very real and the 48 FPS does not ruin the movie in any way. Therefore, do not listen to the critics and run to the movie theatre to witness a movie that reaches the Fellowship of the Ring in terms of quality."

It can help you a lot.<br/><br/>The acting is great and CGI is the expected of Peter Jackson. Richard Armitage was simply fantastic and Andy Serkis as usual the best in his field. I do honestly believe it could have been made into two or even one movie. But one movie wouldn't cover much because there are some scenes from the unfinished tales and The Silmarillion. The White council is not in the Hobbit even though it is mentioned. Plus, the troll scene was a disappointment to me, I hoped to see Gandalf troll the trolls but that didn't happen unfortunately. I think it was remade in order to give more strength to the character of Bilbo.<br/><br/>Overall, it is job well done."
"kevinfan-195-497163","6","2","9","14 December 2012"," ""An Unexpected Journey""
","I personally think the one main reason why I'm not satisfied with The Hobbit is because of how Lord of the rings impacted me. The trilogy to this day is one of the best of the best that I have seen and I unfairly made Hobbit a film with very high expectations. Of course living up to those expectations is really hard and evident in the movie. If you compare the two prologues between Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit you will see a dramatic difference and change. This is clearly inevitable but like all modern movies, the Hobbit strongly incorporates CGI which was not seen in it's predecessors but yet there is a huge circumstantial difference between these two films. Maybe its just people like me who enjoy movies that don't use a lot of CGI or maybe its just because that Lord of the rings was made in a time where we were still scratching the surface of this technology. I sincerely enjoyed the Hobbit as it brought old memories back from the Lord of the Rings like Galadriel, El Rond and Gandalf. Characters who are stamped in my memory and I'm grateful that I got a chance to see them again. I don't really want to focus on the plot since that really is connected to the book which is not relevant to the cinematic aspects. I truly underestimated Martin Freeman's acting, wasn't a big fan of him but I really enjoyed his portrayal of a young Bilbo. For the dwarfs I really don't have much to say, the acting is just mediocre which is what you really expect from them since there's like 13 Dwarfs. I personally think none of them were able to achieve John Rhys-Davies's portrayal of Gimli which was right on the spot for a dwarf. Some of them were either to barbaric or too passive really.

","I was very excited to finally see The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey since I was in love with LOTR movies and have seen them over 30 times in the last 10 years.<br/><br/>Because of that I must admit I was really struggling to get used to the 48 fps. Because no matter what anybody says it's a completely different feel. I'm not sure this was the right movie to introduce this new technology because lots of people like myself really wanted and expected the LOTR look and feel.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 48fps makes visual effects in fast-action scenes look not so high tech. In other words you realize ""oh it's VFX"" and it pulls you out immediately. I never experienced that in LOTR which was made using not as advanced technology. So the problem must be in 48fps.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a beautiful movie and definitely worth watching over and over. Only I wish to watch it in 24fps. :)"

","I am a big fan of LOTR. However while watching The Hobbit; a question kept striking me ""why o' why?"" This was what we STAR WARS fans felt after watching the second installments of series. Peter Jackson is doing it to LOTR what George Lucas did to Star Wars and we shall keep wondering 'WHY' till eternities to come the hobbit is a stretched movie to watch, nothing is different than what we had already seen in LOTR. I always wonder how Bilbo Baggins ended up with the ring at the first place. This movie answers it... 'Gollum dropped it' the Dwarfs are irritating and the idea of having sequel to this prequel is more annoying. I am not going to spend my ticket money on hobbit-2"

"zkonedog","9","1","3","6 March 2017"," Easily Brings Back The Old ""LOTR"" Magic
","When Peter Jackson adapted the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy from J.R.R. Tolkien onto the big screen, it became one of the most epic film series of all-time, full of drama, action, adventure, and fantasy. Now, ""The Hobbit"" is back on the big screen (once again from Jackson) and manages to fully recapture that old magic.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Hobbit"" is the tale of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is unexpectedly called upon by Gandalf the Wizard (Ian McKellen) to participate in a grand adventure to help a group of dwarfs regain their long-lost treasure. Along the way, the group encounters such creatures as trolls, orcs, goblins, and even a sad, slimy little creature who seems to have multiple personalities and is in possession of a very powerful item.<br/><br/>Though many reviews of this movie were quite negative, calling it overblown, strange, or even outright boring, it had the complete opposite effect on me. As a huge fan of LOTR, I felt as if I had been transported back into that fantasy universe once again, and I loved every minute of it. Though the decision to break the one Tolkien book into three movies is controversial from a number of different viewpoints (from ticket sales to subject matter), I can now say that it will (at the very least) be fun to have two more theater experiences inside that LOTR realm.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting part of ""The Hobbit"" experience, however, is the fact that its role in the overall scheme of things (in comparison to the book) is actually just about as opposite as it could be. ""The Hobbit"" book was written as a tale for his children, and thus had a very lighthearted tone. When it was eventually published and achieved great success, Tolkien then decided to write the much more serious LOTR. However, seeing as how the LOTR series was put on the big screen FIRST, it was a challenge to the filmmakers to get the tone right: Stay true to the tone of the book (sometimes goofy), and the LOTR geeks will cry foul. Be too ""serious"", and the book enthusiasts will discount you. Overall, I felt as if Jackson did a solid job of walking that fine line, as this one does have more fun moments than any of the LOTR pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, I really have nothing bad to say about ""The Hobbit"". I have enjoyed the story since I was a child, so to see it done right on the big screen is a treat beyond imagination. To me, it was neither boring nor stale, but rather exciting and intense. Though strange that the journey will not be complete for nearly two years, I will thoroughly enjoy the next two films if they are anything like the quality of this one."

"ericrnolan","8","1","3","13 July 2015"," A short review of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (2012).
","I actually really liked ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (2012). I'd give it an 8 out of 10. And that's even with my own admitted possible bias, as I am not a huge fan of traditional fantasy. I certainly can't claim to be a fan of the original books, because {downcast eyes}, I've never read them. I tried ""The Silmarillion"" once, because I thought that was supposed to come first in J.R.R. Tolkien's chronology  and I just couldn't stay with it. So I guess my take on this movie is that of an outsider, as it was with Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.<br/><br/>But this was enjoyable movie for anyone, I thought. It's a total immersion into an incredibly beautifully rendered fantasy world. I thought the sets and backgrounds were more detailed than the first films, for example. It's a gorgeous movie to look at. The acting is uniformly excellent throughout. And the continuity is just great; there are well crafted segues into subplots that will eventually lead to the original trilogy.<br/><br/>I think the only thing that hampered my enjoyment was that it felt so much like a children's story. (I believe I read once that Tolkien actually began his novel as a bedtime story for his children, while his subsequent ""Rings"" epic was intended for adult, mainstream readers.)<br/><br/>Peter Jackson had his creative sensibilities planted firmly in childhood fairy tale when constructing this movie. For an outsider, this seems like a standard (and sometimes predictable) quest movie. We have a tremendous deus ex machina at the end that a child might not recognize, but this adult did.<br/><br/>The dialogue, monsters and action were often too cartoonish for me. As a fan of creature features, I found the monsters were often too silly to be credible. (I had this small quibble, as well, with the original film trilogy.) With the outstanding exceptions of the Warg and the White Orc, they often seemed like CGI-rendered cartoons. The three trolls who want to cook the dwarfs, for example, were like something out of a silly Hanna-Barbera cartoon. If this film was supposed to engage adult viewers, this creative approach was a pretty big misfire.<br/><br/>But I recommend this, even to people who don't typically enjoy sword-and-sorcery fantasies.<br/><br/>Seriously, though  that deus ex machina at the end  if such an option is available to our heroes, why not employ it from the start of the movie? Hell, why not employ it throughout the entire ""Rings"" trilogy?"
"arussell23","8","1","3","8 June 2015"," 'Unexpected Journey' is enjoyable, but seems slightly unnecessary
","There was once, a novel, written in 1937. The book became a success, as a children's novel, and the author wrote and released, 16 years later, a darker sequel to the story, split into three parts. From this sequel, a whole world spawned that would continue to be created until his death in 1973. What book am I talking about? The Hobbit, of course! What author am I talking about? J.R.R. Tolkien, duh! Let us begin our review of the first film in this trilogy...<br/><br/>...The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. An Unexpected Journey follows a Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins as he is swept up in an adventure with 13 dwarfs and a wizard to reclaim the dwarfs's homeland of Erebor from the terrible dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>I first watched this film about five or six months ago, mainly because I had finally watched the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which I will be reviewing as well), and I wanted to see the upcoming (at the time) Battle of the Five Armies (which I will be reviewing too). So, I finally watched it, and here is what I think of the film.<br/><br/>Positives, first. The acting in this film is really great. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is easily one of the standouts, as he captures the young Hobbit's uncertainty in going on the adventure, while also managing to turn in a great performance. Ian McKellen always does a great job, no need to mention how great he was again. (Even though I just did.) Richard Armitage does a great job as Thorin, portraying a dwarf who loves the fun and adventure, while also struggling with his wish to return to Erebor. All of the dwarfs do a good job, especially the ones we actually start to know, including Kili (Aidan Turner), Fili (Dean O'Gorman), Balin (Ken Stott), and several others. Several characters from LOTR return as well, including Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Saruman (Christopher Lee).<br/><br/>The special effects (for the most part) worked really well. I'm still in awe of how they managed to make Hobbits and Dwarfs smaller than their on-screen counterparts. It's a amazing technical feat. I really enjoyed the music as well, even though half of it was a retread from LOTR, Howard Shore always manages to create music that will stick with you. Misty Mountains is one of my favorite songs from a movie, ever. The cinematography was beautiful as well, the sweeping shots of the landscape as the dwarfs made their quest were amazing.<br/><br/>I'm sure most of you want to hear about the scene that is probably going to be the most remembered from this part: Riddles in the Dark, or otherwise known as, Gollum's 20-minute return to Middle-Earth. Probably the best scene in the film, in my opinion. I enjoyed it immensely, all the little cat-and-mouse games they played with each other worked out beautifully. This is one of the things that saved the movie from getting a lower grade.<br/><br/>Let's get to the negative stuff, unfortunately. I disliked the pacing of the movie. It's not really a spoiler, so I'm going to tell you that it takes 45 minutes for them to get out of Bag End and into the main plot. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it couldn't have been cut down. At some points in the film, you can really tell that they were stretching this into three movies, because certain scenes and plot points that were not in the book or were barely mentioned were given a lot of screen time (Where the hell did Radagast the Brown come from?).<br/><br/>Another thing I disliked was the fact that Azog was a part of the film. Why give someone to chase the dwarfs when they had enough adventures on their own? For example, the troll scene, and other scenes that were either not in the book or barely mentioned? The whole thing felt way too drawn out, and I honestly believe they should have kept it to two movies. Shorten this one, cut DOS in half, shorten DOS entirely, and then tack on BOTFA at the end. Bam, two movies.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a welcome addition to the Middle-Earth saga. The acting, characters, special effects and music were all well done, however the plot had pacing issues and that really affected my enjoyment of the movie. Still, it's a great movie and one I will return to.<br/><br/>8/10. Grade: B"

"williampsamuel","7","1","3","7 December 2014"," A solid start to the Hobbit trilogy
","A decade ago Peter Jackson awed both critics and audiences with his film adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. With its talented cast, stellar production values, epic scale, and faithfulness to its source, Jackson's trilogy was one of the cinematic high points of the first years of the new millennium. Now, after much anticipation, he has returned to tell the story of how it all began, and he's gotten off to a very good start.<br/><br/>The Hobbit works, above all, because it has everything that made the earlier trilogy work. Firstly there's the rich cast of characters and the actors who play them. Ian McClellan remains as sagely, imposing, and playful as ever as Gandalf, and Andy Sirkis has lost none of his effect as Gollum. He's every bit as unsettling and pitiable as when we first met him, and his arguments with himself are every bit as fascinating and entertaining to watch. Martin Freeman likewise is perfectly cast as Bilbo, capturing all of his pluck, courage, and utter bewilderment at the situation he's gotten himself into.<br/><br/>And of course there are the dwarfs. The young, headstrong, and somewhat foolish Fili and Kili fill much the same role here as Pippin and Merry did in the earlier films, and to equal effect. There's also the fiery tempered Gloin, the folksy, cheerful, and rather oblivious Dwalin, the cantankerous old Balin, looking like a miniature Santa, the comically rotund Bombur, and all the rest of the gang. They're as merry and rowdy a bunch of fellows as you'll ever meet, and their antics will often have you keeling over in laughter.<br/><br/>But as jolly and at times buffoonish as they may be, they are also powerful and deadly warriors, and none more so than their leader Prince Thorin (Richard Armitage). Strong willed and keen witted, with a seriousness and solemness that sets him apart from his companions, Thorin has an unmistakable aura of greatness. From the first glance it is visible to all that he possesses incredible fortitude and determination, and that he was born to lead. He is the kind of man (or Dwarf) who inspires those around him to great deeds, and surpasses them with his own.<br/><br/>Even characters who had only a brief appearance in the book are greatly fleshed out here, both in the narrative and physical sense. I only faintly remember Azog the orc lord, but here he makes a most imposing and menacing villain, his bone white skin and bulging muscles reminding me of the sinister aliens from Prometheus. On the other end of the spectrum is the corpulent goblin king, who manages to be more revolting than Jabba the Hut. By far the most delightful addition was nature loving wizard Radagast the Brown. Though he was only given brief mention in the novel, Jackson has made him into one of the most oddball and effective comic relief characters in recent years. I leave it to you to discover his marvelous mode of transportation.<br/><br/>As important as the characters is the story they inhabit, and this obviously draws from a very good one. Anyone who's read the book or has children who have will no doubt be familiar with the tale of how Bilbo is plucked from his peaceful existence in the Shire to join thirteen dwarfs on their quest to recover their lost kingdom from the fearsome dragon Smaug. And for those of you who aren't, I just told you the story, so there.<br/><br/>Jackson hasn't been as faithful to the story this time as he was the last, but special attention given to the most beloved parts. The 'riddles in the dark' scene is exactly the way I imagined it when I first read it years ago, and identical word for word to its source. Even better in my opinion is the hilarious encounter with the three trolls. This one scene better captured the spirit of the old Three Stooges than the Farely Brothers' entire movie.<br/><br/>And there is a great deal of action and sustained battle scenes, all of them very good. I especially enjoyed the running fight through the goblin caverns, fought up and down across and rickety walkways and across collapsing bridges at breakneck speed as hordes of goblins appear from every crevice. Another high point was the flash point to the battle outside Moria, in which hundreds of orcs and dwarfs charge and hack at each other across the rocky slopes. And for sheer visual impact, nothing equals the stone giants. Seeing the very mountains come to life and do battle with one another as the heroes desperately hang on for dear life, it was a hundred times more awesome than I had imagined it.<br/><br/>The nearly three hour runtime has given Jackson time to include practically every scene from the book, many in greater detail than Tolkien wrote them. This is an asset in that no fan will be disappointed because their favorite part was left out. But at the same time this is also The Hobbit's biggest flaw. The fact is that maybe not all the scenes from the book needed to be in the movie, at least not at the length that they are here. At several points I had the feeling that was a three hour movie with only two and a half worth of material. I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't try to cover the entire book in one film, but I do wonder if two movies might have been a better idea than the planned three.<br/><br/>Still, The Hobbit was a very good film overall, with good acting, better effects, much for children and adults alike to enjoy. It may not quite measure up to the Lord of the Rings films, but it was both charming and highly entertaining, and I have high hopes for the next two installments."
"The-Ambassador","7","1","3","27 November 2014"," Less a Film and More an Intro
","First and foremost this is a terribly L O N G movie. Epic does not it justice. For it is truly epic and much more than that, and in that it is inherently just a very long movie -- with very little plot. Which perhaps is the greatest irony regarding this mammoth project of Jackson's. The trilogy format worked so well for him in THE LORD OF THE RINGS films that one assumes that he believed he needed to do the same thing with this remake of THE HOBBIT. Problem is, there is very little story here. This, the first of THREE, is over two and a half hours long. And what is it? The first of three films to retell the tale told in a book for children that's a little more than 100 pages. It is Hollywood hubris gone mad with an over abundance of money resources pride and short sightedness. Yet at the same time it is inspiring to see someone take an ""ah screw it"" attitude and take all that pride money and hubris and do what they want with it. In that Jackson has created in this movie and the ones that follow it something rare in American cinema, art for art's sake. And that is a refreshing thing indeed. It is needless to say that this is far and away the ""largest"" grandest spectacle that's ever been attempted in film. It is gargantuan. Just unnecessarily too long. It could have easily been an enjoyable hour and a half and been just fine. But as it is it still remains a remarkable achievement. We need more artists like Jackson, men who are willing to buck the system for their own selfish desires and delusions of importance. These films definitely deserve the low critical Meta Scores they have achieved; but they will last forever and entertain and astound for generations."
"Justin-r-bates","8","1","3","11 October 2014"," A Genuinely Entertaining Re-Entry to Middle-Earth
","Although I wasn't so die hard about seeing The Hobbit film that I went to the midnight showing, I definitely saw it the next morning (for the discounted pre-noon price!). If box office earnings are any indication, it set a new December record for opening weekend at $84.8 million in North America. <br/><br/>TOP 5 REASONS TO SEE ""THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY""<br/><br/>1) To Understand How the Events of ""The Hobbit"" Affect ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy:<br/><br/>-Did you ever wonder how Bilbo obtains the One Ring? Or how Gollum knows that it is Bilbo Baggins of the Shire that has the Ring? Or how and where Sauron hides between the time of his 'death' at the hand of Isildur (see flashback scene at the beginning of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"") and his resurgence as a lidless, flaming eye atop the black tower? Or how Bilbo gets the sword (a.k.a. ""Sting"") that he passes on to Frodo in LOTR? So many questions to which you will find answers in ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.""<br/><br/>2) To Reenter Middle-earth with a Whole New Story<br/><br/>-Although we are still talking about Middle-earth, a hobbit named Baggins and the One Ring, there is a completely different storyline. Thorin and his company of dwarfs are on a quest to reclaim their homeland, the dwarven kingdom of Erebor, from a foul dragon named Smaug. Gandalf convinces Bilbo, a homely little hobbit, to come along as the company's ""burglar."" The rest of the story revolves around their adventures on the way to the Lonely Mountain as well as the appearance of a rising dark power in Dol Guldur. The One Ring makes its appearance, but its role in this story is much less significant than in LOTR. As a result, we get to see Middle- earth from a much different perspective. For example, we get to learn a lot more about the dwarfs and their history (although it understandably does not necessarily line up with Tolkien's written work all the time). <br/><br/>3) To Enjoy a Fantastic Soundtrack<br/><br/>-Howard Shore, composer for ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy's score, doesn't disappoint. I, for one, love the music from LOTR. I feel like it perfectly complements the story and amplifies the emotions of each scene. To be honest, I was a bit worried that he wouldn't be able to create a new, unique and equally captivating score for The Hobbit - fortunately, I was dead wrong. I loved the film score and found myself humming the main theme for the next few days after seeing the movie.<br/><br/>4) To See Some Familiar Characters<br/><br/>-Not everyone in this film is brand new. Gandalf, Bilbo, Elrond, Galadriel and Saruman all play important roles in this film. Not to mention a brief appearance by Frodo in the first few minutes of the movie. Since Thorin and company will eventually pass through Mirkwood Forest, where the Wood Elves reside, it is likely that they will run into Legolas in the next few films as well. <br/><br/>5) To Be Genuinely Entertained<br/><br/>-Do you like action? There is plenty of sword swinging, arrow shooting, mountain climbing, orc killing action to satisfy anyone - although it's done very tactfully, with little to no gore. Do you like comedy? The dwarfs' interactions are often hysterical and Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo is quite entertaining. Do you like romance? Well, there really isn't any to speak of, since the only woman in the film is Galadriel and she's already married - sorry ladies. Do you like great storytelling? Then prepare yourself for a fantastic tale of adventure, friendship, honor and heroism. <br/><br/>Overall, I am very pleased with the way they pulled it off. Although there is a good chunk of time dedicated to back story and introductions, which is to be expected with any epic trilogy, I was impressed with how Peter Jackson was able to interweave slower dialogue with exciting action scenes in order to maintain audience engagement. <br/><br/>What are your thoughts on the movie? Have any of you seen it at 40 frames per second? Please let me know what you think. Thanks!"

The Hobbit is fun!<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie as stated above, It's great if you just want to relax.

Ian McKellen's Gandalf is, as always, a treat to watch, and he is a great authority figure for the unruly band of dwarfs that he is accompanying. Throughout the film, they get into many twists and traps, and some of the most exciting parts of the film are when the group are running away from things. Due to the incredible CGI landscapes, many parts feel like a video game that you're watching, but this is not a criticism. It's got excitement to it, and because of the plot, we find it more interesting than just a video game. Peter Jackson's vision from the originals carries through seamlessly, and he knows how to make visuals work in an intriguing and captivating way.<br/><br/>The greatest part of the film is kept for the final third, where Bilbo meets one of the best characters from the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy – Gollum. Andy Serkis returns in full motion- capture glory, and there is an incredible chemistry between him and Freeman as they exchange riddles. The introduction of the ring is crucial here, and Jackson shoots the scene so that we can feel both its humour and its importance to the story.<br/><br/>Because it's the start of a new trilogy, which will probably eventually run to a length of about 8 hours, there needs to be lots of exposition. We find out who the dwarfs are, where they're going, why they need Bilbo, and so many other things. At times, the film can feel weighed down with all the information that it has to convey. At 169 minutes, it is undoubtedly too long, like each part of the original trilogy. However it often improves on and retains the feeling of ""Fellowship"", which is the best one of the originals. The actual embarking on the journey is very interesting, as are the new characters we're going to be following in the next two parts.<br/><br/>The biggest uproar that this trilogy has caused is the fact that such a small book has been split into three parts, and despite the fact that this film is too long, as the next two parts will probably be, I'm okay with the decision. There's a lot of story to tell in 'The Hobbit', and with Jackson at the helm, there's no doubt that it will feel mostly secure."

","I had high hopes for this movie, considering what Mr Jackson did with LOTR. And it was very pretty and entertaining. Unfortunately, I feel that he is stretching a great story thin, making unnecessary changes and additions to make more money. Perhaps I'm stubborn, but there was a story I fell in love with when I was a child that I feel has been altered for no other reason than to fill three more films. My other problem with it was the foreshadowing of things to come. These things have all ready been dealt with in LOTR, so why treat it like it's a big mystery? In my opinion, it plays like the Star Wars saga. George Lucas decided to create the better trilogy first, leaving the prequel for later, making it less important and just boring. I don't think the Hobbit is boring; however, if Jackson had wanted to use it as a prequel, he should have made it first. I don't think Tolkien wrote this as a prequel. The changes Jackson made to LOTR made the story more action-packed, which was necessary to sell the films. The Hobbit had enough action within it. In my opinion, what he added took away from the story.<br/><br/>What I love about The Hobbit is it is an adventure. It tells of how Bilbo's life was changed when he ventured into the unknown and began to expand his horizons. If he knew that horrible things might come from things discovered on his journey, he wouldn't have gone and there wouldn't be this wonderful tale. In my opinion, Jackson should have kept it the way it was. Why improve a perfect fantasy?"
"LadyComplainer","9","1","3","28 July 2013"," If not this one, then the next one
","Another amazing movie from Peter Jackson. Though I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. Ultimately, I found that the most exciting part of the movie was the last 45 minutes of this 169 minute film. I want to say that it was worth watching on my decent size flat screen but I honestly think that it would have been more exciting in the theater on a big screen versus my HDTV screen.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a three part movie and this would be the first of three. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh do all three together. The next movie will be out at the end of this year and the third in 2014. I am very excited to see what else will happen. I just hope there is more excitement and that I get to see them on the big screen cause in all reality this first movie was not worth seeing on a small screen, but was worth watching if that makes sense.<br/><br/>The movie is about Frodo's Uncle Bilbo and his exciting adventure before Frodo saves the world. Bilbo Baggins is nothing more than a simple Hobbit that loves his home, food, garden, and shire. It is Gandalf that spoils this. Gandalf shows up out of nowhere and offers Bilbo an adventure of a life time. Though he refuses at first, Gandalf makes it so Bilbo has no choice but to choose an adventure with 12 dwarfs and a king dwarf. Together they go on an adventure and fight trolls, orcs, wolves, and my favorite character Gollum. Though Bilbo has to deal with Gollum all on his own. By the end of the movie we start to learn more and more about family, honor, and courage. This movie may have not been as thrilling as hoped because it is an ""intro movie"". You learn about the main characters and species.<br/><br/>Besides a great plot, you get to see all of the familiar faces from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Ian McKellen resumes his role as Gandalf, Ian Holm plays Bilbo (when he is older as he does in the Lord of the Rings), Elijah Woods plays Frodo (whom you see only for a few minutes), Hugo Weaving as the Elf King Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Lady Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman, and Andy Serkis continues to play my character Gollum. I was very happy and surprised to see a lot of familiar faces.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I would recommend watching it before getting hooked on the Hobbit trilogy. Though one takes place before the other, I think that it will make a lot more sense with things said and done.<br/><br/>http://ladycomplainerblog.wordpress.com/moviereviews"

","FIRST.....<br/><br/>I've never read any of the Tolkien books. <br/><br/>/shrug<br/><br/>Never have. <br/><br/>SECOND....<br/><br/>When it comes to this film, and the three earlier LOTR films, methinks that's a good thing.<br/><br/>I had no desire to see the first LOTR films, but after friends popped in a DVD, I was pretty impressed, as they truly are epic films. <br/><br/>I felt much the same about this film, and like the LOTR films, I found myself pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This is a GREAT film. Period. The characters are well acted, the costumes, sets, and props are among THE highest quality of ANY film, the visuals and effects are excellent, and the story is compelling.<br/><br/>I found this to be a FUN film to watch. The dwarfs are well played, and while they do have fun with the characters, they come off as serious characters that can appeal to adults as much as they can to younger viewers.<br/><br/>While I initially was hesitant to give this one a chance, I'm glad I did, and look forward to further releases.<br/><br/>An epic film worthy of an epic tale.<br/><br/>9 of 10 stars"
"Hitchcoc","9","1","3","25 July 2013"," I Thought It Was a Lot of Fun/Could be Hobbit Forming
","There seems to be an element out there that are afraid that IMDb is going to rank a movie too high. That it is their duty to give films low scores, rather than an honest appraisal. This has something to do with keeping the ""Fanboys"" in line. We don't want to be dictated to by people who are really involved in these kinds of movies. This seems juvenile and dishonest. If we weren't so jaded by the ability to produce special effects beyond our previous imaginations, would we be so cynical. The story is the story. The characters are the characters. Don't criticize Bilbo because he went on the quest, betraying his comfort level. That's what happened in the story. If you want to be critical, look at the elements of film making. I agree that the beginning is quite slow. It takes way too long to get things running. But once they begin the quest, they begin to face off with some incredibly amazing adversaries. If you read the book, you don't see a lot of character development. Gandalf and Bilbo are interesting, but it is in the classic tradition of courtly love. We don't really get to know the Knights of the Round Table either because it is their feats that are the thing of legend. They have a quest and they face off against the unknown, armed only with legend. The result is a series of amazing tasks going to the nth degree. I thought this was quite remarkable and look forward to the next installment."
"Blueghost","Null","1","3","6 July 2013"," It was okay.
","I'm not really sure what to say about this film other then it feels just as over the top as Jackson's take on Tolkien's trilogy a decade previous. There's tons of CGI in this thing, and I think the film suffers because of that. Whether it's the incredible vast CGI cave sets, the vistas augmented by man made CGI works, or some of the roller coaster like action sequences with more CGI, I'm not sure, but I felt a little more detached from this film than when I watched ""Fellowship of the Ring"".<br/><br/>And I do blame the CGI in the movie. The budget's been cut, ergo we don't see actors or stuntmen dressed up as the bad guys, but CGI bad guys, and my god, I am sick and goddamn tired of allegedly photorealistic CGI. No offense to Peter Jackson, because he's doing his best to bring these marvelous tales to life, but someone brought up the idea of CGI, and there is loads and loads of CGI in this thing.<br/><br/>CGI bad guys, CGI animals, CGI good guys, CGI vistas, cgi this, cgi that. Were it not for the documentary I would have sworn that the make up on the actors was CGI. Is that a testament to how convincing and good CGI is? Uh, no, because it is overwhelming in this film. A good use of special effects is something that doesn't necessarily look natural, but helps convey the story. Hey, all those Godzilla films in the 50s, 60s and 70s (and even today) look fake as anything, but kids tend to let Godzilla slide some because he's usually smashing stuff which, for kids (and kids at heart) is really cool. But imagine if you will, if Godzilla smashed CGI tanks, plowed through CGI buildings, then went for a swim in CGI water as he was yelled at by CGI actors. It would grate on you, guaranteed.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what I was expecting from ""The Hobbit"", but, based on King Kong and Jackson's previous foray into Middle Earth, I'm wondering if perhaps I, and other audience members, should not have been a bit more steeled for what was to come. I think most people expected a lighter film than the heavy stuff that was the serious and angsty tone of The Lord of the Rings, and we sort of get that (after a fashion). But coupled with a ever so slightly lighter tone (and it isn't all that light given the Thorin character who carries himself as if the weight of the world were on his shoulders) we have some very dynamic action that only Pete Jacksoun could conjure, along with some drama to aggrandize the Thorin character's legend, and a dash of mental health (no surprise).<br/><br/>All in all I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but I'm very glad I didn't waste $12 American to go see this thing in the theatre, and be forced to wear 3D glasses on top of that. I would have been really angry for a one time show for that kind of money, and my review would have been very different in tone.<br/><br/>How could this have been improved upon? Make the dwarfs dwarfs. Allegedly in the book Hobbits were small in height and stature than dwarfs, but they appear almost the same in physical dimensions. The dwarfs also seem a bit young. So much that I'm nearly tempted to say that I almost prefer the dwarfs in the Rankin Bass cartoon from the 70s than this production. The dwarfs, to be blunt, don't seem like dwarfs. They seem like young human men from some strange fantasy town rollicking in the New Zealand wilderness.<br/><br/>After we take care of the dwarfs, it's time to address the CGI. Do we really need all the CGI in this thing? Do we really need CGI goblins in stead of actors and stuntmen? Does their underground complex need to be as visually colossal as portrayed? I would have been happy with a sound-stage dressed up for the location and filled with several dozen actors. But that's just me. The one CGI I did approve of was the mountain pass sequence. I was wondering if Pete Jackson and his screenwriters were going to remain true to the actual description from the book, and sure enough we witness the true cause of the ""thunder"" during the storm. That, even though I really didn't approve of the CGI in and of itself, was a welcome sequence.<br/><br/>Lastly, hire some older actors. Thorin is supposed to be of some years, but we get some guy who looks to be in his late 20s. Oh boy. Get rid of the archer, let him be a slinger, inject some personalities into the other dwarfs.<br/><br/>Look, all in all I though it was on okay movie. It entertained, and we finally get to see a ""live action"" version of ""The Hobbit"". But, for all that, it would have been nice to have a production that relied less on SFX.<br/><br/>Give it a shot."
"cherold","6","1","3","13 June 2013"," Not quite what I imagined
","I read The Hobbit almost 40 years ago. I don't recall it that well, but I do remember a small, charming adventure story with an appealingly unsure protagonist and a really cool creature called Gollum.<br/><br/>Perhaps my impression of the book is wrong, because it bears very little resemblance to the CGI-fueled spectacle I just witnessed.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a long explanation of how the dwarfs lost their kingdom, and then a sequence with an elderly Bilbo Baggins writing his memoirs, and this surprised me, because I thought the book just got right into it. Since I have a copy (I'm thinking of reading it again at some point), I checked, and sure enough, the 13 minutes that begin the film have nothing to do with the beginning of the book.<br/><br/>It was a short book, but for reasons I presume have to do with making money it has been divided into three parts, the first of which is almost 3 hours long. But it all feels pretty padded; most scenes in the movie could be edited to half the length without any loss of sense. It as though they didn't want one dollar they spent on special effects to go for naught.<br/><br/>At an hour and a half, this would actually have been a pretty entertaining movie. It would begin well if you cut out that first unnecessary 13 minutes, the Gollum scene is fun, and while scenes of a small band of dwarfs taking on thousands of enemies struck me as ludicrous even in the confines of a fantasy story, I did really like those big birds that show up later. And it is nice to see Bilbo's personal evolution.<br/><br/>Here I must admit that I don't like the LOTR trilogy. I find them as slow and full of excess as I do this version of the Hobbit. But then, I feel the same way about the books, so I can accept that the movies reflect accurately what Tolkein was doing. Not so with The Hobbit. The Hobbit could have been turned into one entertaining two-hour movie, but I will leave it to others to slog through the rest of this newest trilogy."
"TyTheRipper","9","1","3","21 April 2013"," I liked it but it doesn't compare to LOTR.
","I thought it had a very good storyline to go off of and the world was very fascinating and grabbed my attention. There were several things that tie in with LOTR and I think that is very cool, one of the big things i look forward to throughout this trilogy. If you're a huge LOTR fan and like it for its visuals and creatures you could be a tad let down. I was disappointed at the creatures, I'm an aspiring FX makeup artist so its something i have such a love for in this series, i felt as they were WAY too animated and I was very upset that they let that happen. Lord Of The Rings had amazing creatures and characters that in no way looked overly animated. Call me spoiled... But I did still manage to like the creatures, it isn't something that is poorly done. Great movie and I cant wait to see where it goes from here."
"ljs3799","9","1","3","15 April 2013"," Amazing film, of course there are negative aspects, but still superb piece of filmmaking!
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, in my opinion, was a super film. There are always things to criticize but we shouldn't ruin these amazingly made movies by picking out the bad things and watching movies like this negatively and critically, but we should enjoy them and be entertained Films are meant to be entertaining and keep you glued to the screen the whole way through, and I was highly entertained. The level of visual effects and scenery just blows me away. <br/><br/>Of course there are things that stand out negatively, for example some mistaken castings or some scenes that just didn't fit in, or even that it was just too long and started to kick in much too late.. All those things do stand out and that was probably the reasons why the movie didn't get as good reviews as LOTR. One thing in particular that stood out for me was the overuse of CGI. I miss the sense of life that Peter brought out so perfectly in LOTR, by (for example) using real people for orcs. The Hobbit made middle earth seem like you're in Narnia or Wonderland. Also I find the character 'Azog the Defiler' to be quite unnecessary unnecessary, his chase of the dwarfs was just too much, and as I have mentioned, maybe if 'Azog' had been played by a human and not digitally animated, it would have brought more life into the film.<br/><br/>Excluding the mistakes, Peter Jackson got it right once again He summed the movie up perfectly and we all have to admit, it was an extremely hard to task. Well, he has done it again. He has used the same tone and themes for 'The Hobbit'. It is everything I wanted it to be. I really loved Martin Freeman's performance of Bilbo. He displayed the perfect characteristics of Bilbo, this is the Bilbo I always thought he would be like from reading the books. Also, Ian Mckellen's performance of Gandalf was just outstanding. He IS Gandalf, no-one on this earth could have played a better Gandalf.<br/><br/>Of course, 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy is incomparable. The style of movie making there was just phenomenal and Peter Jackson took a huge risk in making these three hobbit films, since it was an extremely hard task, but I think he has proved, once again, he truly is the one director to bring the much loved middle earth on screens. I loved the movie and I just can't wait for the second one."
"aag189","8","1","3","8 April 2013"," Like LOTR but more for the young ones
","Great movie. Very well done special effects and the 48 fps made the movie so very easy to watch in 3D. I am a guy who is anti-3D but it worked in this movie. Even though it worked in this movie didn't mean that it was great. In fact I will be seeing the sequels, the two upcoming Hobbit movies in 2D because that is the only way to watch movie. 3D technology just isn't there yet and maybe it will never get there. Anyway. If you liked LOTRs you'll like this. We get to see middle earth and all that fun stuff. I wasn't a fan of the trolls in this movie. They were just silly. I currently have the ranking of this movie at 8/10 but because of the troll I will have to bring it down to 7/10. Let me do that now. There we go. They trolls got a little too clowny for my taste. And the singing of the Hobbits was a bit much but forgivable. Martin Freeman was awesome. He did a great job and I believe maybe the best hobbit I've seen on film. I didn't really care for the hobbits in LOTRs but Martin Freeman was outstanding. I wish he played a hobbit in LOTRs. Just because of Martin Freeman I am going to change my ranking of this movie back to 8 out of 10 stars. Let me do that now."
"ivan2012","6","1","3","24 March 2013"," Nice adventure but disappointing
","Since there are already a thousand reviews for this, let me get right to the point. The first half of this movie is a bit silly and childish, but things get more serious and suspenseful in the second half as the movie begins to resemble the LOTR trilogy movies more. Despite the inconsistency, this is a fun adventure that introduces younger versions of Bilbo, Gandalf, Saruman, and Gollum. The action scenes are incredible if you like CGI, especially the sequence in the mountain, but they are not believable unless you suspend your belief in reality. My final thought is that this movie doesn't make the same emotional impact as the LOTR trilogy and thus is not something you want to watch more than once. This movie goes in the once-is-enough category. And it doesn't make me want to watch the second Hobbit movie coming out this year."

"terrellrobinson71","8","1","3","12 March 2013"," Middle-Earth awaits you...again
","The best way to start off a review of a movie, especially one like ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is to start off with this burning question that has been on everyone's mind (including mine): How on Middle-earth would you take a prequel book which is 300 pages long (mine's 287) into three movies? According to director/co-writer Peter Jackson and his screenwriters Guillermo Del Toro, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, they wanted to expand the story a bit more by using the appendices by the back of the Lord of the Rings books. In a way, having seen ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" recently, it actually make sense. That way, we get a chance to know some of the characters, not to mention, a lot of exposition. Now, that I got that out of the way, I want to talk about ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"". This first part of a trilogy (another one comes out later this year, last one comes out in December 2014) which is based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien (who also wrote The Lord of the Rings Trilogy), is visually stunning, epic and also remains an enchanting piece of filmmaking the way that the Lord of the Rings film series have accomplished by doing. However, it doesn't match the greatness of the original trilogy which won a combined 17 Academy Awards. The movie sags a bit during its middle section, and sometimes, I wish they could take away some of the exposition so that we can enjoy the story a bit more. But those are my flaws for a well-made and entertaining film filled with intense action, amazing moments of humor and breathtaking special effects. Set 60 years before the Battle of Middle-earth, ""The Hobbit"" follows a young hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (a perfectly-cast Martin Freeman from ""Sherlock"" and ""The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy"") who has been asked by a wizard named Gandalf the Grey (one of the few returning regulars, Sir Ian McKellen) to accompany him on an adventure. He reluctantly refuses at first, only to find out later that 13 dwarfs have arrived at his small house, unannounced, including their leader Thorin Oakenshield (the marvelous Richard Armitage). After a raucous feast, Thorin comes up with a plan to take back their kingdom of Erebor from the clutches of the evil dragon known as Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch, in motion-capture form). So Bilbo leaves the life that he loves living in Hobbiton and joins the group, known as a ""burgler"" to the dwarfs, as they head their way towards the Misty Mountains. Along the way, they encounter a trio of bumbling trolls, Orcs, Wargs, Goblins, Elves, Stone Giants, a small creature named Gollum (Andy Serkis) and Eagles. And that's only the first part. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is totally worth the price of admission. For a lot of things, it's somewhat faithful to the writings of Tolkien. It's a bit overlong (It's 169 minutes long), but still you have to admire the craft and the work of production designer Dan Hennah, cinematographer Andrew Lesnie and even the creative teams of Weta Workshop and Weta Digital. Not to mention the returning regulars from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy including Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Elijah Wood as Frodo and of course, Ian Holm as the older Bilbo Baggins, who is telling the story before the events of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" began. Peter Jackson, who won an Oscar for ""The Return of the King"", remains a visual genius. He understood the world of Middle-earth, he knew the characters and he knows how to visually execute the film with style, magic and to give us a hint of darkness, courtesy of composer Howard Shore, who incorporates some of the themes of the old and adding in some of the new. Shot in High-Frame Rate 3D (I only seen it in 2D), Jackson definitely adds something new to the story without letting go too far. What makes ""The Hobbit"" a spectacular feat (and saves it too) is by watching Freeman, Armitage, McKellen and Serkis. They own these characters and we accept them for that. You know what, this is that kind of movie I'll be glad to watch again. Let's hope that the next one, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" will be better than this one somehow."

Slighty slow in starting to set the premise of the new Middle Earth to viewers, but then the journey is full of drama, pathos and action. This film has more scary scenes and has some very graphically hand-to-hand battle violence. It is more violent than the previous LOTR trilogy. (Parents of young children should take note. This is not a Disney kiddie film.) My favorite scene that was particularly well done in this film was when the Eagles rescue the entire group from a pack of wolf riding attacking trolls on a high mountain cliff. I found this film to be not as watchable as the LOTR trilogy, but worth your time especially if you read the book. Good literature put on film."
"asdfsander","9","1","3","16 February 2013"," Very good, yet not as good as Lord of the Rings.
","After about 10 years, the return of Middle Earth on the big screen could have been a lot worse, yet it is not as good as the Lord of the Rings. But let's be honest: few of us had expected it to be as good or better. When I left the cinema, I had a feeling that the 3 hours this film lasted were everything but wasted time. The storyline was good, the 3D effects really added something to the overall experience, unlike other 3D movies I have seen, and the casting was also good, especially Martin Freeman made a Bilbo I liked much better than Frodo in the Lord of the Rings. But the highlight of my evening was, without doubt, the scene with Gollum. If all the scenes in the movie were like that one, it would be just as good as LOTR. With all the special effects, Gollum's cave looked just too real, and so did Gollum himself. For a few moments I thought I was looking at a real-life conversation between a hobbit and another creature..Only the characters that were not in the book (especially Azog and Radagast), were a lot less good, they simply didn't add anything to the movie. I had a feeling they were only there to lengthen it up.."
"ajs709","7","1","3","21 January 2013"," A mixed bag
","Being a fan of the LOTR films and a self-confessed Tolkienite, I must admit I embarked upon my viewing of this film with a deal of trepidation lest it should ultimately disappoint. I ended up being neither disappointed nor enraptured; it was enjoyable but failed to hit the same heights as the previous Jackson take on Tolkien. <br/><br/>Having said this, some of the pitfalls of the film are, to a degree, understandable. The book ""The Hobbit"" is naturally lighter and more whimsical in tone than the often heavy, bleak and biblical language used in the LOTR; in the latter the world is in imminent danger, all the former relates is a jolly old-fashioned adventure. This undoubtedly has an effect on the tone of the film. Danger seems more remote. The film-maker therefore has an issue of reconciling this lack of impending doom with a movie that is compelling. I think this is achieved but not with aplomb. There are too many ""clinging to the edge of the precipice"" moments, doubtlessly shoe-horned in for cinematic effect, for my liking. This does begin to test ones patience and perhaps suggests (gasps) film-making laziness? Perhaps also a reticence to diverge from the source material? It would have been more compelling to have one of the dwarfs not survive one of the numerous skirmishes or scrapes, just to make those of us who know the book more on edge and also to give a little credence to these scenes. But I'm sure that would not go down well with the purists. <br/><br/>Likewise I feel the soundtrack sometimes seems a little ripped-off from the LOTR. One particularly noticeable moment for me was the final stand-off between Thorin and Azog, when a piece normally associated with the Ringwraiths plays. It seems a little out of place. I have a theory as to why that was played at that moment and hopefully this will come through in the subsequent movies, but taking the film as a stand alone, it makes little sense. Other than that niggling point, the score was typically fantastic - that was one area that I was never in doubt about. I do sometimes struggle with film adaptations of Tolkien's songs and thought the one about plates and forks a little cringe-worthy, but found the song which featured in the official trailer moving and also a useful tool to reveal the motivation of these dwarfs. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the expanding of Thorin's back-story. He is not physically the Thorin I imagine when I read the book, but I did warm to him as a character and felt his often dour and stubborn manner is a fair depiction as written. Sadly the other dwarfs are not granted similar depth, but that was never going to be possible. Having said that, I thought Ken Stott's Balin was excellently written and acted. Hopefully we'll see more of them all in the next films. <br/><br/>As for Azog, I actually thought he made a very intimidating and enjoyable antagonist; critics say he was one-dimensional, but come on he is an orc..not every bad guy has to be Iago.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure about Freeman in such a prominent and important role, but again have warmed to him. I think my main issue was the vastly different types of role I have seen him in previously. My concern was misplaced and his performance was subtle and nuanced. And McKellen reprises the role of Gandalf with complete authority and poise - but then would we expect anything less from one of our finest ever actors?<br/><br/>As for pacing, I did find it was slow to begin and too lengthy; any of the action scenes could have been trimmed with no detriment to the film. But let us be honest, action is what a lot of people want from cinema. And I did find the chase scenes through ""goblin town"" fantastic fun and visually inventive. I was also pleased to see the ""riddles in the dark"" chapter rendered so expertly. Other questions, I think - mainly concerning whether there is the material to make three films - cannot yet be answered until the trilogy is complete and a fair judgement can be made. I also feel it rather glib to claim the making of three films is solely a money-making exercise; if films didn't make money the industry wouldn't exist. But I digress. Overall a satisfactory beginning, but no more."

","I must admit I'm not a loyal fan of either J.R.R. Tolkien's or Peter Jackson's work. I've read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy long time ago, and haven't even finished watching Jackson's adaptations. I found both books and movies fun and good but nothing more. Therefore I wasn't very excited when news of ""The Hobbit"" adaptation finally came. Even less promising was an announcement that the book will be adapted as a trilogy of movies. Decision to go and see the first one (titled ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"") nevertheless was motivated almost entirely by the 48 fps in which Jackson decided to film it, and in the end I'm not that sorry for it.<br/><br/>The story of ""The Hobbit"" is already known by everyone, young and old alike, so there's no need to go into it in detail. A young Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins joins thirteen dwarfs and a wizard named Gandalf on a quest to kill a dragon and reclaim the lost dwarven kingdom. That's the basic outline. The problem is there isn't much more to it. As we can expect, the journey can't pass without difficulties, so the merry bunch gets attacked by trolls, goblins and orcs only to be saved by the wizard over and over again, very much like in the LOTR trilogy. But this time it all happens in a dissimilar manner. Instead of creating tension, a feeling of urgency, or any sense of peril, Jackson mostly decided on comedic approach. Thus the dialogues are comedic even when the characters are in great danger as is the way they behave. This, of course, is not the case in all of the situations, but it's present enough to make apparent Jackson's intention of bringing the movie closer to a younger audience. The intention is also apparent in the esthetics of some scenes which resemble video games, like the battle of stone giants or the escape from the Goblin lair. In fact, the whole movie is made similar to a video game, introducing and forming the party in the beginning and then venturing from one battle to the other, occasionally resting on safe ground (Rivendell).<br/><br/>All those things orienting the movie towards youngsters are in fact nothing bad. We mustn't forget that the book was written for children in the first place. What is a little disappointing though is that Jackson obviously didn't have the adults in mind at the same time. The movie has some unnecessary flashbacks and story arcs which may prove too complicated for the youngest to understand while simultaneously being too blunt and shallow for the older audience. Those could have been replaced with some real characterization and meaningful dialogue, or at least left out to give a greater sense of urgency, considering the deadline the characters have. There is also too much dependency on LOTR with the reappearance of the old Bilbo, Frodo, Saruman, Galadriel and Elrond, most of which are completely redundant. It's clear that Jackson wants to connect the trilogies as much as possible, it just isn't as clear why. Although, with a classic trilogy behind us and a first part of a prequel trilogy aiming for children, something smells conspicuously like an inside of a tauntaun here.<br/><br/>In spite of all the minuses I've mentioned (or maybe even because of them), the movie is fun. It's a three-hour-long ride through the land of Middle-earth featuring great comedic performances by Martin Freeman as Bilbo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and all of the thirteen actors playing the dwarfs, as well as the always fantastic Andy Serkis as Gollum. Cinematography, production design, costume design and makeup, as well as the visual effects are all on a level expected of a movie this big, and enriched by the always great Howard Shore's music. The young will probably love ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" as well as the fans of the book and the whole LOTR franchise or those who would like to visit the Middle-earth once again. So if you belong to any of those go to the nearest movie theater and let the journey begin.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>I've mentioned that I've watched the movie practically only because of the frame rate in which it was shown, so I feel obliged to write a few words about it. The opinions are divided between those who are saying that it looks like a documentary about filming the real movie and those who find the frame rate more immersive. I've been skeptical about it but in the end found out I belong to the latter group. The most obvious advantage of a higher frame rate is in quick camera movements which are fluid as they simply cannot be in 24 fps. The problem is that Jackson abuses it in some scenes, inducing dizziness with all the twisting and spinning at high speed, and even the movements of the characters sometimes seem too fast. 48 fps really make the movie look more real, but not in the bad way. The additional frames help the world of Middle-earth and all that inhabits it feel more palpable, as though it really exists, and they even do so more than the (really good) 3D. No doubt Jackson needed a capable crew and a big budget to make everything feel like an actual thing instead of a prop but he largely succeeded. There are probably some things which could've been done better, but it's a fantasy movie, needing much more to create an illusion of genuineness. I can't wait to see some present-set story filmed in such way. 48 fps make a more immersive visual experience than 3D and with immersiveness being the current goal, my guess is that Jackson just set a new standard.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","I was most impressed not by Bilbo, Gandalf or the Dwarfs, but by the Brown Wizard, who is one of the Five Great Wizards of Middle Earth. Not only does he save Gandalf and the dwarfs in one incredibly brilliant move while driving a sled pulled by jackrabbits but he also fearlessly protects all life in his forest. As a solitary wizard, with only animals as his companions, he is literally a guardian angel. He is also on the front lines. Some mysterious evil force is invading his forest. He has real power and he's not afraid to use it to heal or repel evil! Tolkien was obviously an ardent environmentalist & conservationist and I'm so glad this version of The Hobbit makes that perfectly clear! <br/><br/>One of my other favorite scenes is when Gandalf compares his approach to combating great evil with Saruman's. I'm paraphrasing here, but Gandalf believes to fight great evil it's an accumulation of small acts of kindness and the power of compassion that in the end will triumph over great evil. While Saruman believes only great power can defeat great evil. Gandalf and Saruman's approach to combating evil are as opposite as day is to night! We all know from The Lord of the Rings who's philosophy was right in the end!"

(only in the first part of the hobbit he showed more magic and power than in the all three movies of lord of the rings. 5.Great villains like Great Goblin,Azog(SPOILER: Necromancer a.k.a Sauron,Smaug and Bolg) 6.Thorin as character is awesome like some underdog character trying to reclaim his homeland. 7.Great visuals (I watched it in normal 2D). 8.Beautiful landscapes. 9.Brilliant action (dwarves fighting like team and fantasy action like Kili blocking arrows with sword and Dwalin...) 10.I almost forgot Gollum (riddles in the dark and Gollum goes crazy angry)."

","To be honest, at first I was a little reluctant to spend almost three hours to see thiz movie but I know I will go anyway, just for curiosity's sake. However, it ends up with ""Wow!"". Thiz movie serves as a prequel to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy consists of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002) and ""The Return of the King"" (2003). The tale starts with a comfortable pace and very good peaceful feeling by showing the beautiful Hobbit Village. I'm surprised that some scenes are almost too simple and humble for epic like thiz. Don't get me wrong, I love thiz part very much! There is a cameo appearance from Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and it's also about how they introduce young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the uninvited thirteen dwarfs one by one. It's not quite as grand as the previous trilogy, it's merely simpler, but surely has heart in it. For me, Peter Jackson is another George Lucas with his Middle-earth universe. Jackson really knows for sure about how every single thing should look like. His attention to detail both visible and unseen is remarkable. Thiz movie is very neat and well-arranged. You almost can't find a single hole or mistake. Everyone takes their role proportionally. Martin Freeman delivers his central figure with depth as Bilbo Baggins. Richard Armitage shows a precise charisma as the dwarf leader Thorin Oakenshield . Ian McKellen brings his presence with wisdom as the powerful wizard Gandalf. And plus the minor parts but memorable ones like Christopher Lee as the white wizard Saruman, Hugo Weaving as the mighty elf-lord Elrond and Cate Blanchett as the beauteous elf Galadriel. All three of them look younger and divine than ever. And last but certainly not least, the dirty creature Smeágol finally comes out and perhaps it would be the most awaited scene for the fans. Just like in the previous movies, thiz character is amazing! I almost can say, Smeágol (also known as Gollum) might have delivered the best acting for overall, not because the other Actors are bad, but you can see it yourself, the complex emotion and sound are very convincing. The man behind it is Andy Serkis. There are so many similar adventures have been made before, but only a few like thiz J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium that is definitely beyond imagination. Everything is bigger than anything. It's like creating a whole new world in a whole new way. It's a great basic material as a novel in the first place and it's even a greater presentation as a movie. In summary, thiz movie is worth watching even if you're not a fan. Thiz is a journey that you want to take.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is less than my expectation. The 48 fps cinematography is awesome but not for my (traditional) taste. Its beautiful scenes are just too 'beautiful', losing its realistic magnet. <br/><br/>The film is sitting on a fence: its story-telling is clearly dedicated for children but the violence and its way-too-long duration are for adults. Compromising both sides doesn't seem to work well in this case.<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson's approaches seem a bit dull, nothing refreshing compared to his masterpieces, The Lord of The Rings trilogy. During its making period, I was hoping to watch a fresh creation of directing, a kind of what Sam Mendes has successfully injected into James Bond's Skyfall."
"tomgillespie2002","6","2","10","24 December 2012"," Will suffer in comparison to Lord of the Rings, but still a satisfying trilogy opener
","Back in 2001, when critics and audiences alike were raving about a new film called The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I was reluctantly dragged to the cinema to spend three hours watching hobbits and wizards battling orcs and trolls, with lengthy moments of, well, not much, in between. I was relatively disappointed given the excitement surrounding the film, and was left perplexed at how well-received it was. As the months went on, and the DVD release approaching, the film somehow got better in my head, and I felt myself getting impatient to see it again. It finally came out, and I watched it every day for a week. I fell in love with the film, and it ultimately became my Star Wars - a film I could recite from memory, and one that will always be beloved to me. So almost ten years since the release of The Return of the King (2003), and after a change of director, numerous legal wranglings and a perforated ulcer, we finally have Peter Jackson's release of The Hobbit.<br/><br/>For a children's book of only approximately 300 pages, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is hardly on the scale of The Lord of the Rings, so it was surprising when the announcement was made that it would in fact take place over two films. Great news, I thought, as this would give Jackson time to flesh out the story and give the vast number of characters (namely the thirteen dwarfs who are often indistinguishable in the book) some much-needed depth. When filming wrapped in summer of this year, even Tolkien die-hard's we're shocked when a third instalment was announced, and that Jackson would not only film The Hobbit, but also integrate some aspects of Tolkien's many appendices to tell a richer tale and expand the universe. So with An Unexpected Journey came an unexpected trilogy (thanks for that line, Marc), and for those accusing Jackson of simply seeing dollar signs, I ask you if you truly believe the man who wore an old jacket and Hush Puppies to the Academy Awards, and who directed low-budget delights such as Bad Taste (1987) and Braindead (1992), really seems the type to care only for his wallet?<br/><br/>For those wanting more of the same magic that came back in 2001, you'll be in for a treat. For those wanting a great film in it's own right will be left sorely disappointed. The near-perfect structure and pacing of Fellowship in mirrored here almost exactly, with a lengthy introduction set in the Shire, a stop-off at Elf kingdom Rivendell, a huge cave battle in the Misty Mountains, and a final battle against a hoard of rampant orcs. And while this approach evokes fond memories of those years between 2001 and 2003, it also slightly undermines The Hobbit as a great story in its own right. Therefore, certain incidents that occur throughout the film feel thrown in to create some kind of bond between it and Lord of the Rings. Gandalf says to Bilbo, ""every great story deserves a little embellishment,"" and this is a clear wink from Peter Jackson to the fans that his intention is to simply expand and elaborate on Tolkien's universe, rather than meddle with it.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm all for Jackson's idea to widen the universe, as long as the results are good enough. The addition of the wizard Radagast is a nice diversion from the central plot, and his encounter with the mysterious Necromancer (played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who will also voice Smaug in the later films) adds a darkness to a relatively light story to rival Sauron's menace in Lord of the Rings. But without an established 'bad guy' (as Smaug is only briefly glimpsed here), Jackson has thrown in the giant goblin Azog (Manu Bennett) to provide an enemy for Thorin, who witnessed his father's beheading at the hands of Azog in the defence of Moria. He provides a suitably despicable villain, but fails to show any real dimension when compared to the likes of Saruman (Christopher Lee) from the original trilogy.<br/><br/>As well as Lee, Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood also reprise their roles (given they weren't in the book) as Galadriel, Old Bilbo, and Frodo respectively, and although their appearances are relatively pointless, they add a familiar face and help add to the feeling of continuity. If there's one thing the film nails, it is the celebrated Riddles in the Dark chapter, where Bilbo meets Gollum (Andy Serkis) and unwittingly discovers the One Ring. It's a truly brilliant scene, one of the major standouts in the entire saga, as Serkis delivers another truly exceptional motion-capture performance. His split-personality was magnificently documented in The Two Towers (2002), but here we witness a truly pathetic creature, reduced to pure desperation upon realisation his beloved ring has disappeared. As an invisible Bilbo watches him, Gollum's eyes are filled with a mixture of blind panic and sheer grief. It's another triumph for the special effects wizards at WETA.<br/><br/>It's difficult not to keep comparing this to the previous trilogy as this is very much its own story, but Jackson's insistence in linking the films makes it impossible. An Unexpected Journey doesn't come close to the satisfaction of The Fellowship of the Ring, yet it's still explosive, enthralling and honed with the same amount of love and dedication. Martin Freeman proves a warm lead, although he isn't given the screen time he and his character deserve. Armitage is also a success, but his character channels the same reluctant angst as Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn and is (at this point in the story) merely a warrior to cheer in comparison to the gentler Bilbo. Yet the sequels will determine the trilogy's legacy, and I hope The Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again (due 2013 and 2014) will expand on An Unexpected Journey's satisfying opener.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"jamaalrgreen","7","2","10","20 December 2012"," A Tale of Two Hobbits
","Typically I only watch a film in 3D only after I've seen it in 2D. Sometimes it feels like 3D comes across as a gimmick and I'd hate to give a film a bad review based on a gimmick that did not work out well. I watched the Hobbit in both 2d and the much advertised 3D High Frame Rate of 48FPS. From what I understand 3D films suffer significant motion blur with scenes that have fast movements in them. Peter Jackson wanted to eliminate that problem by shooting in the higher frame rate which lends a much sharper image. I'm not an expert cinematographer so thats my best attempt to explain why the film was shot that way although I'm sure that's not the only reason. I can only commend Peter Jackson on having the stones to take that risk especially with a project of this magnitude. He is a pioneer and willing to push the envelope of filmmaking. However I feel the technology in filmmaking is moving so fast that the practices and how to apply them effectively are taking a back seat. Watching the Hobbit in two different formats resulted in two different experiences.<br/><br/>Hobbit 2D:<br/><br/>The Hobbit fell right in line with the Original L.O.R. trilogy minus the the apocalyptic tone and raging body count of Return of the King. Although the general mood is the same you can feel that the tone of this story /book is a bit milder than that of L.O.R. This story brings back all the familiar faces and places of middle earth plus some new stuff. ORCS,Goblins,Dwarfs,Elves,and Hobbitzes are all back in the usual stylings. The story starts with a Hobbit sporting a familiar last name enjoying life where he is as Hobbits do. He is reluctantly drafted to embark on an adventure which Hobbits hate. The plot is set 60 years prior to the Fellowship of the ring but follows a similar formula. Some familiar faces such as Gandalf,Saruman and the beautiful Lady Galadriel are back in usual form. A decade later it seems that for the most part the actors have not aged and picked up right where they left off. Over all the CGI,Cinematography and Lighting are top notch as it always seems to be with Peter Jackson and the action is no less heart pounding or suspenseful than expected in middle earth. However the story does seem to take it's time getting started and it feels like the first act is a never ending collage of filler scenes designed to extend the new trilogy. Overall if you did not like Lord of the Rings then you will not like the Hobbit. If you did enjoy Lord of the Rings then you will most likely enjoy the Hobbit but will notice the subtle differences. My Grade is a B.<br/><br/>THE HOBBIT 3D HFR<br/><br/>The most impressive and yet jarring quality of the 3D HDR version of The Hobbit is the ridiculous clarity and focus. As the sensors on cameras become more and more sensitive and the practicality of shooting films in 4k and 5k increases I believe films shot in HFR are here to stay.(at least for a little while). The clarity is astonishing as every detail in every frame is in full focus. It's like looking through a very clear window. With the High Frame rate comes the loss of the ""Persistence of Vision Theory"" associated with traditional 24fps.The result is the Hobbit looking more like pristine video. Too much is in focus too much of the time and it affects almost every shot. The extreme focus is too distracting and takes away the ability to be immersed in the world you are watching. It's most evident in close up shots as you now notice all the makeup effects and prosthetics on the characters. The motion of the characters looks weird in HFR as well. Almost like an old Chaplin film with a sped up camera. The lighting in the HFR version is not very forgiving. I am unsure if there is a different color grading process for High Frame Rate but it seems to affect the lighting. All the warm tones in the lighting seem to go cold. Yellow and golden hues seem to become white in the HFR version. There are hot spots in many shots and several scenes almost feel overexposed. These issues were not not a problem in the 2D version. Especially in the lighting. The 2d version was a beautifully lit film. Where the HFR excelled was on the sweeping long and wide shots. Landscapes and skies were reproduced beautifully. Over all the experience of the HFR provided too many distraction in all it's high clarity glory and at times felt like I was watching a video game or a pixar movie screened on LED TV. I believe HFR is here to stay but it will take some time for the other disciplines,(i.e. lighting,make-up,postproduction services) to catch up. Then I believe the end product will be amazing! My Grade C-"

The dwarfs showed up at Bilbo's house in twos except for Thorin, who came alone according to the book, but in the movie it was one, then another, then two, then the rest and Gandalf, then finally Thorin. 3. when the dwarfs came across the trolls, they only saw a light and sent Bilbo to see what was there. When he reached the trolls, he went to steal one of the trolls wallets, which was enchanted to make a noise whenever it was pulled put of the troll's pocket, the trolls never stole the ponies. 4. Gandalf saved Thorin's company by enchanting the trolls to argue till dawn. 5. Radagast the Brown never met Thorin's company. 6. The company was never chased by Orcs, in fact, there weren't any Orcs in the book. 7. Galadriel was not in ""The Hobbit"". 8. The company and Gandalf were chased into a tree when they came across a Warg meeting, the Wargs waited for Goblins because Wargs couldn't climb trees, but Goblins can. So Gandalf through fire balls at them. The Goblins came and started stomping the fire out and played in the fire. The Eagles came and attacked the Goblins because they saw the Goblins and hated the Goblins. They only save Gandalf and Thorin's Company because they owed Gandalf a favor. In the movie, they were chased up a tree by Orcs and Wargs. Gandalf had a moth send word to the Eagles to save them. 9. In the book, the Eagles flew the company to their nests were Gandalf spoke to the Eagle king. 10. elves sang and were more merry in the book then the movie. 11. In the cave in the mountains, according to the book, everyone had fallen asleep when the cave opened. The opening of the cave woke up Bilbo who screamed and woke up the Dwarfs. <br/><br/>There were more differences, but those are the main differences. Even though the movie and book were very different, I still, surprisingly, loved the movie. The soundtrack was particularly good. I loved how Howard Shore used a twist off of ""The Lord of the Rings"", which combined the two movies together. Just like in ""The Lord of the Rings"", I loved how the Hobbits, their mentality, and their lifestyles were depicted. Over all, I think the movie was a huge success and I look forward to the other parts."

","I went into this Film with great expectations, after the LOTR trilogy which I have always loved. I had doubts when it was announced to be released in three parts. However my thoughts reconciled into that of curiosity when Peter Jackson announced that this was partly due to the input of many of the appendices. I wondered before the film if this would be a good thing or not. The introduction of the white Orc early in the film did spice up the film a bit giving it a slight taste of LOTR, considering the film has a relatively slow and dry start. However the new system of making all orcs, wargs...etc. With CGI proved to be a low point. This is because it makes the characters seem video game like, which puts them somewhat out of place. Also I found that the White Orc totally dominated the storyline so much that you almost felt underwhelmed by the Great Goblin, which is a huge scene and character in the book. The film was also very stop and start and perhaps a little to comical at times.<br/><br/>However I have been negative up to this point but there were several things that did impress me which is why I have given 7/10. Martin Freeman totally convinced me as a young Bilbo. He was a much better actor than all previous hobbits. The necromancer input into the storyline, injected excitement into a otherwise dull start. Andy Serkis completely stole the show as Gollum. He was hysterical as well as threatening and scary. Also the camera work showed off New Zealand (much more than in LOTR) to perfection and it yet again continued to be a superb middle earth. The film did get good by the end but then of course it ended leaving you feeling somewhat unfinished.<br/><br/>It would have been better split into two parts as you felt you were watching a rather long introduction rather than a segment of a story. However I hope the next one will impress me more as right now it is not on the same level as LOTR."
"robert-w-andrews","8","2","10","17 December 2012"," An enjoyable return to Middle-earth.
","After the unfortunate, but inevitable end to the original breathtaking trilogy in 2003 the reemergence of both Middle-earth and Peter Jackson has unquestionably created a great sense of anticipation over this festive season, as there is a constant questioning of whether this extended adaption of the original Hobbit novel will match the same sense of success as its flawless predecessors. Unarguably the production is extremely enjoyable, as the adventures of Bilbo Baggins expose the viewer to an explored side of Middle-earth that is accompanied by the thankful return of many familiar faces. However there is certainly a sense of expected seriousness and tension that often falls absent, as this is only worsened by the senseless CGI dominance that prevent ""The Hobbit"" from aspiring to a success that is associated with the original trilogy. <br/><br/>Following the legendary adventures of Bilbo Baggins, he unwillingly accompanies a faction of Dwarfs led by Gandalf the Grey who seek to retake their homeland that was spontaneously laid siege to by the great dragon ""Smaug"". For the most part the plot is fairly lighthearted and often employs comedy within the dialogue and habits of all the adventurers, yet the dark moments of battle and conflict offer little amusement. With a widespread selection of fairly unknown characters, the film is left to often rely on Mckellen's major role and the several other cameo appearances from individuals such as, Christopher Lee and Hugo Weaving in order to retain a sense of familiarity in relation to the previous trilogy, as the revisiting of previously minor characters interweave perfectly within this fairly unknown and unexplored narrative. However regardless of these thankful returns to familiar faces, in some cases certain climatic moments that result in fast paced action do not reach the expected level of anticipation that has been become a trademark of Jackson's interpretations of the 4 novels. With that in mind when events do eventually reach the peak of excitement, they often end in laughter and relief for the characters fates.<br/><br/>CGI had unquestionably been a major factor within the visual successes of all 3 previous works, yet Jackson's ludicrously experimental decision to double the previously used 24 frames per second serves as a huge hindrance to the films questionable appearance. Previously many of the Orc's had been primarily presented within a handmade costume design that proved to be disturbingly authentic,yet on this occasion Jackson disregards this in turn total CGI dominance. At times the CGI does work in creating beautifully designed setting and special effects, yet in action sequences in particular it is simply too unauthentic and fast paced, as an ill timed blink could leave you oblivious to an enjoyable segment of a battle. With that in mind this fast paced action is another element of its differentiation from the original works that may possibly prove more popular in the future, as for now the action is still enjoyable, but not perfected. <br/><br/>Jackson's supposedly avid and relentless interest in Martin Freeman's involvement in the production was certainly justified due to the accurate portrayal of an earlier and less adventurous ""Bilbo Baggins"" he delivers. Freeman consistently keeps within the lighthearted approach by providing his own personal comedy within this unexpected hero and wanderer of Middle-earth, as his performance falls very close to predetermined expectations. Ian Mckellen's return as the wandering wizard ""Gandalf"" was evidently vital for the films success and overall reception, as his major role committed him to far more action and screen time than ever before in this saga. Much like Freeman viewers are also exposed to a fair amount of humour, but as mentioned it is his action and leading role that have contributed to Mckellen's successful portrayal of one of the greatest fictional heroes of all time. <br/><br/>Flawless casting choices continue to flourish within the unexpected appearance of Richard Armitage as Dwarve ""Thorin"". His transition from T.V to Hollywood seems virtually effortless, as to distinguish Armitage as a primarily T.V actor from this production alone would encounter much difficulty. His ability to create a stubborn and fearless character may not entitle him to the becoming the most likable character in the production as leader of the Dwarfs, but his performance is admirable and essential to the past of the unfortunate Dwarfs that the viewer is exposed to. The cameo appearances from Christopher Lee and Hugo Weaving as their respective characters did serve the film greatly, yet it is the return of Gollum that ironically proves a sight for sore eyes. This clear doppelganger and chaotic character is once again played to perfection by Andy Serkis, as this disturbing characters inclusion in the plot reveal his first encounters with Bilbo and allow viewers to make the links to these events that were not explicitly covered in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". <br/><br/>Now although Jackson may have lacked the ability to create a production piece worthy of the same status as his perfected previous works, ""The Hobbit"" in its own right is an extremely enjoyable production. A fruitful mixture of both new and familiar characters and their ability to converge in a simplistic yet intriguing plot is where the films true successes lie in relation to retaining a sense of familiarity and at the same time offering a unique element of differentiation. My only hope for the next equally anticipated sequel is that Jackson leaves behind the awful CGI techniques and returns to the sublime presentation he has been widely recognized for."
"The_Film_Cricket","10","2","10","17 December 2012"," A giddy, red-blooded adventure
","If Peter Jackson didn't have a passion for the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, then his enterprise to bring Tolkien's vision to the screen would be for nothing. This is a story very close to his heart and the evidence is there on the screen. For this venture, he has put everything in his filmmaking arsenal into his work, and it pays off beautifully. That was apparent ten years ago with ""The Lord of the Rings"" but it is even more apparent as he begins another three-legged journey into ""The Hobbit."" <br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a giddy, red-blooded adventure, teeming with atmosphere; filled with dread and wonderment, action and suspense, wondrous and fearsome creatures, magic and mayhem, and of course, a quest – no great adventure has ever been without one. The story takes us back 60 years before the events of ""The Lord of the Rings"", but this is no mere imitation. This first leg of the trilogy breaths with a life and an energy all its own.<br/><br/>We catch up with the elder Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) who is about to celebrate his 111th birthday. Seated at his writing desk, he begins a journal to his young nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) who is on the cusp of a life-changing adventure of his own. The story flashes back three generations and we meet the young hobbit Bilbo (Martin Freeman) who is cozy and comfortable in his solitary life in The Shire, thank you very much. Soon, he his visited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) who enlists him for a quest. Knowing that Bilbo's answer will be a firm no, Gandalf tells the others in the party to show up unannounced at Bilbo's house.<br/><br/>The purpose of the mission is quite desperate. Some time ago, an army of Orcs and a dragon called Smaug ripped apart the home of the dwarfs and sent the survivors running for the hills. With no home and no hope the dwarfs vowed to reclaim their home. This is the reason that Gandalf has brought 13 of their best men to Bilbo's door. Bilbo is reluctant but eventually agrees, mostly when he wakes up the next morning and realizes that the party has left without him.<br/><br/>The 13 dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf are a motley bunch but they are far from slouches in the defense department. The dwarfs are led by the melancholy Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who is haunted by what he saw when his home was taken over. This is not just a silly quest for weapons or jewels but the desire to return home. You can see it in his eyes. Bilbo's journey is crucial to the story. The central underpinning of the story is the mysterious connective power of home. Bilbo has always been a home-body, more comfortable with dishes and doilies than swords and sorcery. He complains that he is not fit for this quest, but there is a conversion in his soul when he comes to realize that whereas he has the creature comforts of home, he has to set aside his selfish concerns to help a group of men who have no home.<br/><br/>What follows this brave band on their journey is a nearly non-stop roller-coaster ride of adventures, some of them a great deal of fun, including a run-in with a trio of dopey trolls who want the Hobbits for breakfast. Other pitfalls along the way are thwarted by goblins, giants, trolls and orcs in a journey that is one damn thing after another. One of the best moments takes place as the group is stuck in the middle of a brutal fight involving rock creatures the size a skyscrapers. The troop comes slowly to realize that the ledge on which they stand is actually the creatures thigh, And yet, the best is saved for last, a reminder of one of the reasons that Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films were so special to begin with. That, of course, is the creature Gollum. As with the book, he doesn't enter the story until nearly the film's third act, but his entry lifts the end of the picture into something more special than just a fight. We know his story and his plight. Here his sickness for the ring is in blissful harmony, and along the whims of destiny comes Bilbo to upset that balance. <br/><br/>Gollum has always been representative of the power of corruption and greed. Like a drug addict he is tortured with two minds fighting over what is right and what is devoted to the addiction. Here he is, a few generations back from when we first met him. His mind slightly more focused, at least focused enough to get involved in a game of riddles. The answer will provide an exit for Bilbo from Gollum's cave. This scene, in a way, brings the two trilogies together and helps us understand the beginnings of Gollum's possession.<br/><br/>In the months leading up to the release, there has been a question of how Jackson was going to split Tolkien's 300-page book into three distinct films. The advantage is that in having such a large amount of screen time and such a minimal story, he is able to focus on the characters and their eccentricities. That was something that ""The Lord of the Rings"", as good though it was, seemed to lack. This film has more personality and more depth and we feel for the characters a bit more. This is a more intimate and much tighter story. In that way it outclasses the other films. This is the best film in the series and one of the best films of the year."
"webbolad","10","2","10","17 December 2012"," Perfect!
","Watching The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in a movie theatre was undoubtedly the best experience i've ever had watching a movie. I watched it in the regular 2D 24fps, and it was extremely immersive. The visuals were crystal clear and the special effects where superb. I wasn't sure if Peter Jackson would be able to make hordes of CGI characters and settings look believable, but he sure does! The CGI characters look just as real as the live action actors and the settings are really beautiful to behold. I could seriously watch a 3 hour movie set in solely Rivendell it looked so incredible.<br/><br/>All of the actors were perfect in the movie. Martin Freeman does the character of Bilbo so much justice that I feel he was born to play the role. He nails Bilbo's bumbling, fussy nature at the beginning of the movie and seamlessly transitions into a brave adventurer as the movie goes on. His timing with line delivery is perfect as are his interactions with the other characters, particularly Gollum. Speaking of Gollum, Andy Serkis has outdone himself yet again. When Gollum first appeared on screen, everyone in the movie theatre gasped at once, knowing we were all in for some acting gold. Although Gollum is only in the movie for about 15 minutes altogether, those 15 minutes are some of the most memorable in the movie. Gollum's interactions with Bilbo are more lighthearted on a whole than in the LOTR movies, because Gollum has not yet been consumed by the loss of the Ring, although he does have his moments of violent schizophrenia (MY PRECIOUS!!!). With the enhanced CGI since the LOTR movies, Gollum looks more real than ever. The famous game of riddles is extremely entertaining and funny as well! But when Gollum loses his ring, he instantly shifts back to the foul creature he was in LOTR, highlighting Serkis' acting skills even more. Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf and does an incredible job. Gandalf has a larger and more physical role in this movie than in any of the LOTR movies, fighting and casting awesome spells regularly, yet still shows his wise and caring sides when interacting with the other characters in calmer settings. Another actor that surpassed my expectations in this movie was Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. He really nails being a really tough guy and respected leader through the movie and in some of his scenes, you can't help but think 'he is extremely cool'. As for the 12 other dwarfs in the movie, they are excellent too. I can't necessarily pick out certain things about every one because there are so many,but as a group they really shine at being a merry yet fierce group of warriors. People may complain about the cameos in the movie, but I think they add to the whole experience. It was good seeing Frodo again, even if it was for 2 minutes, as well as Saruman and Galadriel. What I like about these cameos is that they all have a purpose in the movie, they're not just thrown in there for the sake of it. Even though they may not be in the book, they really do help to enhance the story. The final character I will talk about is Radagast. Radagast brings a new, strange colour to the movie and like the other characters that aren't in the book, enhances the story, Radagast extremely so. His character explores the rise of Sauron (or the Necromancer), which I found really interesting. On the whole, all of the actors in the movie did a superb job; when you're watching the movie, you completely forget your watching actors and feel totally invested in the characters.<br/><br/>The movie stays absolutely true to the book, with more scenes and characters put in by the movie writers to make the story even better. The screenplay writers for this movie did a really fantastic job on the script. Scenes in the book that may have been a few sentences long are explored in high detail in the movie, and it is very interesting to watch. At no point when I was watching this movie did I feel it dragged or that scenes where put in just to increase the running time. Every piece of dialogue - including the newly written parts and story lines for the movie - matter, and really contribute to the epic scale and immersive-ness of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie was so incredible that it has encouraged me to create an IMDb account and write my first ever review; I just needed to express how good this movie is! I plan on watching it in a movie theatre again and trying out all of the different formats it was released in. If you are planning on watching this movie for the first time, I recommend watching it in 2D 24fps first, just to fully appreciate the supreme acting,visuals and story without anything that could hinder the experience. The movie is so engaging and exciting that when the credits started to roll I still wanted to see more; I didn't want to leave Middle-Earth yet! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey really does take you on a journey from the Shire, to Rivendell, to the heart of a huge orc city and more! When the action starts it never lets up; not only are the action sequences exciting and incredible to watch, you genuinely want the characters to succeed as well, which is something some movies fail to get from the viewers. <br/><br/>Everything about this movie; the acting, visuals, settings, story, action and cast - is perfect."
"Jangobadass","7","2","10","16 December 2012"," Enjoyable, but not quite as good as LOTR
","Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is an uneven start of the journey of the Hobbit Trilogy that is filled with both good and bad moments that will appeal and appall casual viewers and Tolkienites alike. There is a good movie & story to be found here, but Jackson and New Line Cinema overreached and the results are a mixed bag.<br/><br/>Making a movie for each book in the ""Lord of the Rings"" series was a smart move. Making a trilogy out of the simpler, more straightforward ""The Hobbit"" is an odd one. No doubt New Line wants to recapture the magic (pun partially intended) of LOTR, as well milk Tolkien's work as much as they possibly can. There are scenes and elements to tie the two stories together and even elements from other Tolkien works like. Even things that got a passing reference in the book are fleshed out more here. Perhaps too much...<br/><br/>A prime example would be Azog. In the book he's only mentioned two or three times and was a footnote. In the movies he's Thorin's sworn enemy in an attempt to give this trilogy a central villain. An attempt that doesn't really work as good as likely intended...<br/><br/>Likewise, events that were mentioned but not seen in the book (and the previous version of TH from the 70s by Ranking & Bass Animation) are given the full treatment here. This was to be expected when you think about how battles in LOTR was to long and eventful. For example, it was mentioned that Gandalf & the Dwarfs had to fight there way out of Goblin Town and one HAD to expect the movie to show it. True enough, it's an eventful combo of chase and battle reminiscent of Indiana Jone or The ""Pirate of the Caribbean"" movies. I liked it, but I'm not sure others will. And I'm sure everyone expected a flashback of how Smuag took Lonely Mountain to literally start the story with a bang.<br/><br/>There are cameos by Frodo (Elija Wood), Galadriel (Cate Blanchete), Saruman (Christoper Lee) and Ian Holm as the older Bilbo to strengthen ties between the two series, some Sauron foreshadowing (including saying his presence is what made Mirkwood murky), and they even go so far as to say that Gandalf helped the dwarfs because he was concerned about Smaug would side with the baddies later. Radagast has small roles in other Tolkien stories but didn't appear in the original book. Here he is almost a different character, has quite a role and may help out more later.<br/><br/>The real problem is that it tried to hard to be like LOTR. Thorin ends up being an Aragon expy and it very different from the book and cartoon movie and there were several scenes that gave me deja vu. And I really didn't want to feel that here...<br/><br/>Some may grouse about the movie having too much comedy, but I'll give that a pass since Tolkien originally wrote TH to be a more lighthearted, fun story than LOTR, even if things get kinda of sitcommy at times.<br/><br/>""I think the worst is behind us"" Bilbo says just before the ending. I thought, ""I sure hope so..."""

","First off I am a huge fan of the The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series, but I'm not rating this movie high because of that, I'm rating it high because it's simply that good! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the best movie I've seen since Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. This movie was absolutely perfect. Fantastic performances from Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage! Yes the other dwarfs don't exactly get that much attention, but thats okay, because there are so many of them. I didn't feel as connected to the dwarfs as I did the fellowship, but I think that will change in the next two movies. I will say this, the movie is absolutely beautiful! Gorgeous landscapes, breathtaking skies, and the CGI in the film (don't know what people are complaining about) is amazing! It felt great to be back in Middle Earth again, and it's never looked so good. I also will say that I saw this movie in 48 frames per second and in 3D. The 3D aspect of it was great, I haven't seen a movie be this good in 3D since Avatar. I adjusted to the 48 frames per second right away. I don't know why people complain about this so much, I thought it looked crystal clear. I never once felt that the realism took me out of the story. This may not be the best trip to Middle Earth, but it's definitely a sight to see. I feel that this movie isn't exactly fit for kids, since there are a lot of be-headings. This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone over the age of 13! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an expected masterpiece and so much more!"
"rockingprashantpathak","10","2","10","16 December 2012"," An Wonderful Journey
","Firstly let me clarify that I saw the movie in HFR, so if you find me rambling off into the wilderness, let me be.<br/><br/>The movie is fantastic to say the least. But then after the LOTR series I expected nothing less from the master himself. The story is crisp and always in motion, unlike other movies where you yell 'get on with it'. I found the story easy to follow, being a Tolkien fan, but I don't suppose people could due to the vast amount of references scattered throughout the story.<br/><br/>The movie is peppered with trademarked sweeping landscape shots that look fantastic in HFR, fight scenes that were a little fast to follow, and each character with appropriate screen time.<br/><br/>What really blew me away was the look and the feel of the movie. Peter Jackson has done what other directors fail to do, that use the 3D to show depth rather than throw things at people. It was amazing to watch New Zealand's vast mountains lying in front of you as if you were watching it through the window. You, Mr. Jackson, had me 'fully immersed'! <br/><br/>I'm already waiting for the next install."
"eshwarmail","7","2","10","15 December 2012"," An adventure that felt a little unnecessary but entertaining and spectacular nevertheless
","Its inevitable but to draw comparisons with LOTR trilogy and rightly so. The theme, cinematography, music, some scenes are direct descendants from LOTR with some beautiful 3D visuals. Peter Jackson has played the nostalgia card to brilliant effect leaving a perfect time gap from the previous trilogy. Some scenes may feel redundant, some characters not very well developed and the overall story so far is neither as complicated nor as involving leaving everything to be done by the acting and presentation departments who deliver the goods.<br/><br/>In the Shire, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is getting ready for his birthday (the same day as in LOTR: Fellowship of the ring) while finishing up on his book. He recalls the 60 years earlier adventures in his mind with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) in a fight to reclaim their home. Also recalls his encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and possession of The Ring. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman was cast perfectly and he oozes life into Bilbo while Ian McKellen is as solid and charming as ever. It follows the same theme as the first edition of LOTR with dwarfs, Gandalf and Bilbo forming a fellowship on a mission with a stopover at Rivendell, encounter with Orcs and a sight of the destination at the end. But the mission is less involving and even less adventurous so far, the fellowship does not have the variety of characters and Martin Freeman is not the guy who is made out to root for.<br/><br/>3D effects and CGI are of top quality especially the following scenes > Introduction to the cause for which the dwarfs are fighting for > Zooming to show the ghost warrior > Birds, insects flying towards and away from us. The final scene with the Eagles. > Scenes with Gollum<br/><br/>Also some scenes felt quite unnecessary and forced > Mountain giants fight > The cheesy Orcs king > Unnecessary tension between Thorin and Bilbo does not help to reduce the flatness of screenplay<br/><br/>You haven't seen the actual villain of the story yet, but so far it has been the screenplay. It is flat with no effort to make it intriguing and the climax does not make you to sit up and look forward for the sequel. But it doesn't mean it is not entertaining with one set piece after another and a host of brilliant CGI effects give you more worth than what you paid for. The background score draws a lot of inspiration from the LOTR trilogy and I don't blame any of it except for the song at the end credits. <br/><br/>An adventure that felt a little unnecessary but entertaining and spectacular nevertheless"
"patrickwigington","6","2","10","15 December 2012"," A Promising Start
","Fortunately, the first installment of the adaptation of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit works. Peter Jackson, who directed the Lord of the Rings trilogy a decade ago, comes back to try and tell the more whimsical tale of Bilbo Baggins, dwarfs, and a dragon. Unfortunately, This first in a new trilogy has at least several flaws that it must overcome before things get good.<br/><br/>This movie only covers the first third of Tolkien's book, so we see no dragon—except glimpses in flashbacks. The movie begins with Ian Holm, portraying the old Bilbo, talking about his adventure, and setting it up nicely with a tale of how Smaug the dragon came to take over the Lonely Mountain from the dwarfs. However, this dual cameo from Holm and Elijah Wood (back as Frodo) is completely unnecessary, and really not interesting. However, once we get to the real story, things start to perk up. Gandalf asks the young Bilbo if he would share in an adventure, and later on the grumpy stay at home hobbit has his home overrun with dwarfs. This dinner party drags on a little too long in its attempt to introduce all 13 dwarfs, of which only 4 or 5 stand out as fully formed characters. However, the unexpected party does provide a good deal of interesting exposition, and the introductions of the characters really help to bring an emotional depth to the movie. They eventually set out on their journey, and things get much more fast paced.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is fantastic as the young Bilbo, and carries the movie through its good and bad parts. Freeman captures the essence of the titular character, giving him a grumpy and perpetually annoyed feeling that works quite well. Ian McKellen returns as the wizard Gandalf, and his presence welcome and reassuring. Other returning actors, such as Hugo Weaving as Elrond and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel are very unnecessary but quite good. The movie also features the wizard Radagast the Brown, played by Sylvester McCoy. Radagast is a welcome portion of the film, giving it the lightheartedness the movie needs more of.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis also returns, in motion capture form, as the creature Gollum. The scene between Bilbo and Gollum is certainly the highlight of the movie, and Serkis gives a fantastic performance. The game of riddles that the two engage in is done with equal measure of grace and suspense.<br/><br/>The faults of the film lay mostly with the script. Director Peter Jackson's decision to split the two part film into a trilogy created a lot of room for what seems to be things that really don't matter. As a result, the movie lacks the urgency and quick pace that the book has. However, Jackson seems to be making a trilogy that is much more a prequel to The Lord of the Rings than it is an adaptation of the whimsical and less-all-encompassing children's book.<br/><br/>Jackson's directing is much less maximal than it was in his previous venture to Middle-Earth. Instead, Jackson focuses on the magical elements of the world; using expressive backdrops, and having the forests and mountain caves glisten with wonder and danger. Even Gandalf is more magical than he ever was in Rings. The colors are bolder and more on the forefront. As a result, the juxtaposition between light and dark becomes an intricate part of the movie. Even the Ring glistens with ridiculous shininess. Jackson has come out of his slump of bad movie making (2005's King Kong and the miserable Lovely Bones), and now comes almost to the heights he reached when making the Rings trilogy. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite make it. At least not in this installment.<br/><br/>This reviewer didn't see it in 3D, or in the new 48 frames per second, and that more than likely works in this movie's favor. Jackson may think these things are the wave of the future, but certainly the nuisance of 3D outweighs the slight benefit of watching a movie turn into a pop up book.<br/><br/>The movie is certainly flawed, but it is also very promising. Once all the bullcrap is cleared out of the way, the movie really soars in its fantastical way. The sequels should (hopefully) be even better. Throughout the movie, we get a taste of the places to come; the forest of Mirkwood, the town of Dale, the Lonely Mountain in the distance, and even a glimpse of Smaug. All of these things look very promising, and An Unexpected Journey delivers a decent amount of goods itself. The movie may not be a great success, but it is, after all, only the first act. So, if you can forgive the filmmakers for splitting the story up into three movies, the first installment of The Hobbit is really damn good."
"sullivanradley","7","2","10","15 December 2012"," The Hobbit HFR 3D
","Made the hour-and-fifteen-minute-long trip to a city to watch the special high-frame-rate version of THE HOBBIT. At 48 frames per second, it looks like an episode of THE GUIDING LIGHT (or maybe some other soap opera, perhaps one that's still on the air). Or, like a hobbit (never pictured in the film because he's behind the camera) decided to shoot a home movie. That said, it's well crafted, and I think fans of Middle Earth will enjoy the non-HFR version of this movie just fine.<br/><br/>Not being nutters about LOTR (Lord of the Rings) in general, I must confess that I was bored a few times in those three hours. That doesn't change the fact that it must be absolutely nightmarish to make a movie on this scale. I bet, more than once, Peter Jackson (the movie's director) wished he'd shot the whole movie on the set of The Shire, with Bilbo walking around, expounding, spilling the entire bushel of beans to a disinterested, glassy-eyed Frodo. From a CGI standpoint, Gollum has come a long way; I could even see the moisture on his eyeballs this time.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>My favorite character was the wizard (Radagast the Brown) who lived out in the sticks (well, the sticks beyond the stones), with his team of sled-pulling rabbits, housecat-like hedgehogs and nesting birds in his hair that crapped down the side of his face every chance they got."
"timsmith37","6","2","10","15 December 2012"," Technological cul de sac rather than timeless fantasy
","The film did not feel as drawn out beyond its natural length as I had feared, and, refreshingly, the story has not been too tinkered with. It was notable that more of Tolkien's original dialogue survives here than in LoTR, while the plot changes felt less arbitrary, than, for instance, Aragorn falling off a cliff. The backstory has been mucked about quite a bit, with some loss of meaning, but the gist is there. There is a genuine respect for the source material, more so than in the first trilogy, as in the bold, and to my mind successful, decision to recreate the opening 'unexpected party', complete with songs.<br/><br/>The interpolated White Council scene feels stilted, but the magical woodland adventures of Radagast and his furry chums are not as cringeworthy as they could have been. Other changes are mostly for justifiable cinematic reasons, even if some, such as the treatment of the encounter with the trolls, are not necessarily an improvement in dramatic terms. However, the need to give this first installment a distinct dramatic focus causes tensions with the book. A dynamic between Thorin and Bilbo is sketched in which is absent in Tolkien's work, and this is resolved in a way which jarringly detracts from Bilbo's own personal character arc. <br/><br/>Since the ring arrested the ageing process in Bilbo, Ian Holm could strictly speaking have continued in the part, but Martin Freeman's light comedic touch actually works very well. Richard Armitage channels Sean Bean as Thorin, and is rather more broodingly handsome, and a lot younger, than I had imagined, but I guess an action film must have an action hero. A reasonable stab is made at differentiating the other dwarfs, even if the bizarre tonsorial creations and confusion of regional accents is a little distracting. I also found it odd that one of the few dwarfs to develop a distinct personality in the book, the amiable strongman Dori, is unrecognisable in Mark Hadlow's depiction of him as a rather twee old buffer. Graham McTavish's tough Dwalin and Aidan Turner's boyish Kili are probably the most successful realisations.<br/><br/>What fatally undermines the project is the misjudged technological gimmickry. There is the usual 3D issue of the actors looking like cardboard cut-outs in a Victorian toy theatre, so divorced from the scenery behind that it might as well be a blue screen. Worse, HFR has the curious effect of making all the interiors appear as if they were shot on video at BBC Television Centre in the nineteen-seventies. To add to the disconcertingly retro feel the prostheses and hairpieces don't really stand up to that level of high definition. Sometimes there is something to be said for grainy and indistinct. And while the CGI was often excellent, it was over-used to the point where the connection with real actors and landscapes was lost, the swirling camera work giving the action scenes in particular a distinct video game vibe. <br/><br/>Better than perhaps it has a right to be, given the uncinematic source material, but the of-the-moment technology makes it ultimately disposable.<br/><br/>PS. I note that IMDb autocorrects the spelling of 'dwarves' to 'dwarfs'. Tolkien would be incandescent."
"rooee","7","2","10","14 December 2012"," The King Returns
","Since Sir Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, he's created the fantastic (King Kong) and the fantastically awful (The Lovely Bones), and now we're back and it's like we never left. Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel)... they've aged like elves - not a day. Tonally this is breezier than the Lord of the Rings (let's call it LotR) trilogy, but great care has been taken to ensure that it fits seamlessly into the same universe. The same exquisite detail in close-up; the same use of long shots to make the characters tiny in a vast world. <br/><br/>J. R. R. Tolkien's little book concerns a little hobbit, who lives in a hole, who finds himself on a big adventure with a gang of dwarfs, overseen by the wizard Gandalf. Tolkien's dwarfs, seeking an almighty golden hoard hidden under a Lonely Mountain, are closer to Time Bandits than a heroic Fellowship, but Jackson and his co-writers (now including Guillermo del Toro) have shifted their purpose to something more laudable: the reclaiming of their homeland. <br/><br/>In a beautifully crafted opening, after elegantly intersecting with The Fellowship of the Ring, the bumbling dwarfs are introduced to Bilbo and ourselves one by one, as unwelcome visitors to his humble home. They eat, they sing, they talk, and the scene is set. These are the characters we'll follow in almost every scene. The Hobbit is much more linear than LotR; scenes concerning Radagast the Brown (a wonderfully eccentric Sylvester McCoy, channelling the spirit of Tom Bombadil) and Azog (the orcish slayer of Thorin's father, Thrain) are brief asides rather than parallel plots.<br/><br/>So it's all about the dwarfs, and we get to know a few of them well, particularly the bold leader, Thorin (Richard Armitage). He's as close to our Strider, except more reckless, driven by rage, and far less trusting of the titular halfling. As Bilbo Baggins, Martin Freeman is a more subtle performer than Elijah Wood. And he needs to be - a hero as reluctant as Bilbo is a tough sell, but Freeman convincingly depicts a gradual self-realisation: a drive from within, rather than a compulsion from without.<br/><br/>Jackson proves once again that he's the master of combining CGI with human emotion (even though actual humans are conspicuously absent from the story). The scene involving the Storm Giants - living, fighting mountains - is a good example: rather than giving us an omniscient hawk's eye-view of the battle, Jackson focuses on the real drama: the dwarfs and the hobbit, clinging to the giants' knees. And then there's Gollum, arriving for a late cameo. The best chapter in the novel becomes the best scene in the film, with Bilbo and the unlikely keeper of the One Ring riddling in the dark. The special effects might not be technically groundbreaking as they once were, but their integration with real actors remains unsurpassed in cinema. <br/><br/>A couple of issues. Not everyone will get along with the joviality and the slapstick. Once or twice I do feel that certain scenes contain a knowing look too many. (When Gandalf is telepathically communicating with Galadriel, I swear he nods at the audience.) Thankfully, it's consistent, and rarely at the expense of immersion. Also, given what we know, perhaps more could have been done to foreshadow the LotR trilogy - there's certainly room for this in the Rivendell sequence (in which a shabby Gandalf the Grey, in the presence of even greater greatness, looks humbler than we've ever seen him). It's conceivable that an extended cut will provide more references to the impending doom of Middle-Earth. <br/><br/>Given the brevity of the book, what concerned me most was how Jackson et al could possibly expand the story into the first part of an epic trilogy. The fact that they have, without the film feeling baggy (Bag-Endy?), is, in a sense, an even mightier feat than the adaptation of the LotR novels. It doesn't have the emotional depth of LotR, nor the narrative breadth. It never did. But it has humour and action in droves, along with warmth and intimacy. And it's amazingly good fun - more Jim Henson than Game of Thrones; more Whedon than Nolan. Which is okay by me.<br/><br/>Expect An Unexpected Journey to be condemned as boring and overlong by professional critics (the same critics who probably laud Bela Tarr). Expect it to be dismissed as frivolous and silly. But, more than anything, expect to be entertained by a delightful fantasy film."

","The 3D work was OK though it screamed that it was not made with that in mind. Most of the impressive 3D shots were gimmicks entered later with CGI.

I'm certain now that most that badmouthed 48fps were just incapable to disassociate their TV from movies; bad from them, it's not the movie's fault per se, it's pure personal psychology they had.<br/><br/>In overall, the movie as a story and movie, an 8.

"DubhDoo","7","2","11","20 December 2012"," Not a masterpiece, but still a great return to Middle-Earth
","*I must add that I did not see the film in 3D or HFR, only the normal 2D 24fps*<br/><br/>With 'the Lord of the Rings' trilogy, Peter Jackson crafted something truly special; by adapting what many considered to be the most unfilmable fantasy novel ever, he presented us with something the like of which has never been seen before. The three films were one sweeping epic of spectacle, brilliance and emotion. So after $2.82 billion in box-office gross and 17 (wholly deserved) Academy Awards, the Kiwi director has returned to Middle-Earth with 'An Unexpected Journey', the first instalment of his Hobbit trilogy. ""But should it have really been a trilogy?"" has been the question on the lips of many, with numerous reviewers criticizing the film's 169-minute runtime, labelling sections of the film, in particular the opening 45 minutes as ""turgid"" and dismissing it as nothing more than a self- indulgent money-making exercise. When the final instalment 'There and Back Again' is released, time will tell, but for the most part of 'Unexpected Journey' it never really feels as if Jackson is desperately taking out the rolling pin and clutching onto every last comma of the source material.<br/><br/>It opens with not one, but two prologues; the former of which is concerned with an attack on the Dwarven kingdom of Erebor, where we are introduced to two important players, Thorin (Richard Armitage) and Smaug the dragon (Benedict Cumberbatch). The second prologue transports us to a more familiar setting: Bag End, where we see Bilbo Baggins (played by the reliable Ian Holm for this scene) and Frodo (Elijah Wood) preparing for Bilbo's 111th birthday, tying in quite nicely with 'Fellowship'. This leads into the main story, as we meet a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) being met by a wizard calling himself ""Gandalf the Grey"" (Ian McKellan), who tricks the home- loving Hobbit into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of 12 Dwarfs, which doubles as Bilbo's recruitment as their ""burglar"" to help them steal their treasure back from Smaug. After 20 minutes of banter, singsongs, doilies and James Nesbitt's god-awful hat, Bilbo reluctantly joins the group and the adventure begins...<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is wonderful as the eponymous character, offering a nice contrast to the gloomy and weight-of-the-world- on-my-shoulders-isms of Frodo. He is instantly charming and likable, longing for ""tea"" and his ""books"" over Orcs and Wargs. His best moment is possibly the 'Riddles in the Dark' scene where he encounters Gollum (Andy Serkis) and combines his wit and cleverness with genuine fear; Serkis is also extraordinary in his single scene, but really, what else would you expect? Ian McKellan is also great as Gandalf, sharing some lovely moments with Bilbo and once he steps back on screen, it feels like we never left Middle-Earth at all. The Dwarfs are, despite a lengthy runtime, somewhat of a muddle and only a handful properly stand out – Kili (Aidan Turner filling the Legolas role of a handsome archer), Balin (Ken Stott providing a voice of reason), Stephen Hunter as Bombur (essentially the portly comic relief), James Nesbitt's Bofur (thanks to that hat) and of course, Thorin Oakenshield, a role in which Armitage channels Aragorn, a link strengthened by the 'king without a kingdom' side to his character.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the film looks truly beautiful; whether it's the familiar sight of the Shire of the Misty Mountains, it is undeniable that Jackson and his longtime DoP Andrew Lesnie have an uncanny eye for capturing the magnificent beauty that New Zealand has to offer. A number of shots of the group trekking across vast landscapes (shocking, I know) exemplify this, in particular a Warg chase set upon expansive open fields and a snow-covered mountain range- set moment. This complemented by a fantastic score by Howard Shore; he and Jackson fell out on 'King Kong' due to ""creative differences"" and as a result, did not work of that film or Jackson's following project 'The Lovely Bones'. Thankfully however, they have reunited for 'The Hobbit', with the Canadian composer delivering a great score that blends 'Lord of the Rings' motifs with new musical cues. The way that the melody of the Dwarfs' Misty Mountains song was used as the movie's main theme was a lovely touch. <br/><br/>The film is far from perfect though; it's over reliance on CGI robbed some moments of a sense of physicality, as a character such as Azog, the chief Orc, would have been portrayed as a man in prosthetics in the Rings trilogy, but here he is unfortunately a fully CG character, which got me longing for the days of Lawrence Makoare. Sylvester McCoy's wizard Radagast the Brown verges on Jar Jar Binks territory especially with that bunny-led sleigh, but thankfully he doesn't outstay his welcome. There are also a handful of moments where the pacing dips slightly, fortunately not to an extreme capable of scuppering the film. Its runtime may also test the patience of newcomers looking for fast- paced fantasy romp.<br/><br/>'An Unexpected Journey' is a great start to the 'the Hobbit' series. Is it as good as its predecessors? No, that would be a near-impossible feat. But is it still an excellent film? Absolutely. As longtime Middle- Earth fan, I can safely say that this movie exceeded my expectations, as following all the negative feedback from many professional critics, I went in expecting something worse. It is visually gorgeous, exciting, and moving with a huge strength in the form of Martin Freeman's Bilbo. With Mirkwood, the Battle of the Five Armies and Smaug all to come over the next two films, it can only get better, and if it does, then my, what a trilogy we'll have on our hands."
"cafesmitty","6","2","11","18 December 2012"," Exasperating Slow start
","First, I think people who are ""true"" fans, the D&D, Gamers are going to love this film no matter what. I love the other three, but to give you my honest opinion, this film is so slow of a start that I wanted to give up on it. I like the film, but didn't love it and I tell you why. The Dwarfs makeup were so fake looking that it played more like a Saturday Morning Puppet show than a adventure movie. And of course they come in all shape and sizes and for a minute there I thought they were rejects from a Snow White film. They sure acted like it. But the movie just trudges along at a slow pace and it's not revealing any true relevant information. Unlike the other three, when this one was over, I wasn't thinking ""wow"". I was thinking, thank god. It fees a heck of a lot longer than 3 hours, I can tell you that and a good movie should never make it seems you are spending more time in the theater than you actually have. I think true fans will love it, but I think most people will like it. Once the movie got going and the pace picked up, I thought it gotten better. But o me, it is Peter Jackson version of the Phantom Menace. Beautiful to look at, but missing that ""X"" factor. It isn't magical. It is just another movie, not an adventure. It's a bit too kiddie. I can't see myself sitting in the theater and watching it again. I couldn't get past the slowness and the fake-looking characters. One last thing... beautiful set and I welcome all the familiar faces."
"kunalkhandwala","10","2","11","16 December 2012"," A Cinematic Event, Peter Jackson's triumph in HFR
","The revisit to Middle-Earth itself required a collaboration of three production studios. Let alone the challenges of stretching the smaller material into a trilogy in higher frame rate picture. If anyone could be that crazy, it would be Peter Jackson. The result of his tireless efforts is not just an epic movie or a great technical feat. It is a Cinematic Event. The first of a trilogy, 'An Unexpected Journey' is an outstanding movie experience that immerses you in every aspect, thus living up to the epic, that is The Hobbit. <br/><br/>As Frodo helps prepare for his uncle's long expected party, the original Hobbit is busy finishing his book that speaks of his adventure with the dwarfs. Flashback about 60 years and we have young Bilbo as Martin Freeman, smoking his pipe outside as he is humorously greeted by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who seeks someone to join him on an adventure. Denying any such whimsical participation, the Baggins of Bag-end confines into his large Hobbit-hole only to be later intruded by unexpected dwarfs who then busy themselves feasting in his own home. Soon enough, after a round of introductions, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) reveals the plans to take back their city of Erebor where now dwells a mighty and terrible dragon over his hoard of gold. Jackson brilliantly transitions from the beginning of the Rings adventure to the tale of the Hobbit and while recreating the lost city of dwarfs, Erebor, he makes us yearn to journey to it with a legendary rendition of the song of Misty Mountains cold. As the company journeys into lands known and unknown, they encounter trolls and goblins from whom they only nearly escape. The hidden valley of Rivendell is revealed to them through a secret passage and it is a spectacle to behold. Meanwhile, Radagast the brown (Sylvester McCoy), the eccentric wizard whose home is with the creatures of the forest, discovers a dark force that now dwells in the fortress of Dol Goldur. Jackson's expansion of this sub-plot reveals much about the lurking threat of the necromancer who brings back the darkness that was long overcome. The white council meet in Rivendell to debate over this threat and of Gandalf's participation in the Dwarfs' adventure. Cate Blanchett reprises the role of lady Galadriel who enchants with her beauty and aura. From hereon, the company continues over hill in daunting weather when the stone giants awake, hurtling rocks at each other. Their subsequent capture by Goblins and confrontation with the Great Goblin in the underground city leads to an epic escape which is quick because much of that time is diverted to Bilbo's chance encounter with the greatest special appearance of all time..... by Gollum. <br/><br/>The Riddles in the dark chapter is the film's obvious highlight. Gollum seems to have fun threatening to eat the Hobbit, which soon turns to irritation, celebration and dismay during the riddle game. The venting of anger and frustration is brilliantly portrayed by Andy Serkis who is indomitable in motion capture performances. There are goblins on wargs and fires on pine trees after they all escape the Goblin city. Thorin seeks to eliminate his old threat that is Azog the Orc, just as Gandalf sends a message for rescue. <br/><br/>Technically, the film is richer than the dwarfs' treasure. The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie capturing cities and landscapes alike, the special effects and costumes by WETA that brought to life the unthinkable, the background score by Howard Shore, together created the film's epic look and feel. Conspicuously, the 3D HFR effect is profound in several scenes. The sequence in Bilbo's home give a sense of being there, the detail in the dwarfs' costumes and swords is fascinating, so is the magnificent city of Erebor, the artsy home of Rivendell, the 3D capture of rocks flying from everywhere (whoa!) as the stone giants arise, the details in action in the Goblin city and the sharp clarity of the astounding scenery taken from the skies.<br/><br/>They couldn't have found a better Bilbo Baggins than Martin Freeman. He excels in scenes around the dwarfs, in Rivendell's splendor and with Gollum. Can't wait to see him with Smaug.... Richard Armitage looks heroic as Thorin and with a focus on his back-story, becomes one as well. It will be interesting to see how he deals with the changes in his character. Among the several dwarfs, Balin (Ken Scott) is the mature and wise one (mostly) while Sylvester McCoy is splendid as the eccentric Radagast the brown. Andy Serkis is a remarkable artist whose depiction of Gollum turns out to be the film's highlight act. Notice his expressions as he says 'time's up' and 'wasn't talking to you' and you will be convinced. As a guiding mentor, Gandalf is the most revered character and Sir McKellan's performance draws the same respect in the film's cast for good reason. Somehow, Galadriel and Elrond look younger than they did a decade ago.<br/><br/>The director adds some more interesting elements to create a dramatic effect that doesn't deviate much from the original story but only enriches it. The moth still flies to Gandalf in times of distress to aid a rescue while the same background score plays and that, is Peter Jackson's magical touch. <br/><br/>Our first journey in the trilogy is as epic as we would expect and maybe even more. With sublime performances from a huge star-cast, ground-breaking technology, mind-bending detail of costumes and sets, an exhilarating background score and an exhaustive screenplay that is so engaging, the revisit to Peter Jackson's Middle Earth is well worth the decade long wait and is a thoroughly enjoyable movie event. Fans of Tolkien's world will be watching it again before biting their nails to next year's sequel and will cherish each moment of it because for them, the journey has just begun. <br/><br/><ul><li>9.65 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"jodee2970","5","2","11","16 December 2012"," Should be called 'Lord of the Dwarfs'...so disappointing!
","As a huge Tolkien fan, I had nerves about Lord of the Rings being brought to the big screen. But Peter Jackson and co pulled it off. <br/><br/>With the Hobbit, sorry to say that I think Martin Freeman was hopelessly miscast, and he conveyed no real emotion for three hours. But this is not the biggest problem with the film.<br/><br/>I never expected it to be as good as Lord of the Rings, because although I think The Hobbit is a great book, it is just not in the same vein.<br/><br/>Both the Lord of the Rings films and booked conjured a gripping, thrilling tale. Brilliantly defined characters and a world you could believe in. <br/><br/>The Hobbit - the book,has all that, and more.<br/><br/>The Hobbit - the film, has none of this. It's all about the Dwarfs, and nothing much about Bilbo himself. Was Peter Jackson giving Martin Freeman less screen time because he knew he just wasn't up for this iconic role?<br/><br/>Take the two most important scenes - the ones with the Trolls is so brilliantly talked through by Ian Holm in LOTR - you felt the fear of the situation, given the gravitas IH gives to the role. Martin Freeman just doesn't look like he could carry this off - and it's not because I don't like him - he was great in The Office, but simply failed on the big screen.<br/><br/>The most critical scene - The Pity of Bilbo - didn't work, and I so wanted it too. It failed, and so, for me, the film failed.<br/><br/>No sense of fear, wonder, bewilderment from Martin Freeman.<br/><br/>Pete Jackson has been criticised in some circles for making three films out of a relatively short book.<br/><br/>You must do it for the love of film making and story telling - this film reeks of profiteering. <br/><br/>The only saving grace is Andy Serkis as Gollum. <br/><br/>An abject failure of a film. Peter Jackson needs to go back to the drawing board.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>My wife's review - and she loves the Hobbit more than I do.<br/><br/>She also feels it should be called Lord of the Dwarfs - why is he trying to make it in the mould of the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Casting was poor - Martin Freeman conveys no real emotion - in the whole of the three hours.<br/><br/>Also the Troll scene and the cave scene with Gollum should have been great but were made into a children's school-play. Very upset with all the changes. It feels like a cheap blockbuster instead of her favourite book.<br/><br/>The dwarfs don't feel like dwarfs either.<br/><br/>The music was not right, and there was too much scenery and running around aimlessly.<br/><br/>Main thing was MF as Bilbo - he could not act at all and was completely out of his depth. The only expression in his face is trying to make his eyes look bigger.<br/><br/>Did not feel we were really on an adventure with him.<br/><br/>Body language exposed his lack of understanding of the role. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson hasn't put any real thought into it.<br/><br/>Undecided about seeing the final two films.<br/><br/>The screenplay is just awful, and tried to force me to laugh, and the dialogue is third rate. Was this really the same writing team? <br/><br/>If you do things for money, you destroy the spirit of the venture.<br/><br/>A very unhappy Tolkien fan."
"RainDogJr","7","2","11","16 December 2012"," Not entirely successful; still I can't wait to watch the second part!
","Boy oh boy, it's been already eleven years since Peter Jackson gave new cinematic life to the work of J.R.R. Tolkien. For mere nostalgia, I'm really happy that since this year December is again synonymous of the Middle Earth (well, the last film is actually set for a July 2014 release). So the first part of the trilogy that precedes THE LORD OF THE RINGS (2001-2003) is finally here, after the 2010 departure of Guillermo del Toro and a long production. <br/><br/>One of the first thoughts I had after experiencing THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, in its HFR 3D format (48fps), is that del Toro would have done something closer to the brilliance of ""Lord of the Rings"". Don't get me wrong, Peter Jackson is obviously a great director; from his early 16 mm guerrilla filmmaking, totally influenced by Lloyd Kaufman and Troma, to his transition to big budget, high technology territory. With ""Hobbit 1"" (I'm calling it this way to simplify things) Jackson is moving forward in technology matter. But I don't think this time the results are entirely successful. <br/><br/>The first minutes of this movie make evident why Lloyd Kaufman himself always goes for 35 mm and why Quentin Tarantino is thinking in becoming only writer now that almost everything in cinema is digital. No other movie so far has left it as clear as this one did. A movie in a movie theater no longer looks like a movie, as simple as that. <br/><br/>For moments I felt I was watching one of those videos that appear when you're about to begin a video game mission; in other moments I thought that the movie hasn't been yet edited and that I was watching a ""behind the scenes"". If you wanna find out how a HFR movie looks, just find your LORD OF THE RINGS DVDs or Blu-Rays and check out the behind the scenes features.<br/><br/>Jackson said that it only takes time for you to get used to HFR. But I don't think so, it isn't a matter of get used to it. It's just that there are some shots that do look amazing and really beautiful; some elements did get benefice from this technology. The character Gollum, for instance, looks better than ever. <br/><br/>And to talk about a great Gollum is, without a doubt, a clear indication that ""Hobbit 1"" ain't only a synonymous of bad news. In fact, Gollum alone makes this worth watching stuff. After his brilliant participation in the reboot RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (Rupert Wyatt, 2011), Andy Serkis returns to the character that gave him immortality, and he simply steals the movie with that classic insanity of his – in this part Bilbo Baggins meets Gollum and the ring.<br/><br/>The story may be taking us to the days when Bilbo was young but it's very similar to what we can find in the first ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. A clear mission; a fellowship ready to accomplish it (this time mostly composed by dwarfs); Gandalf the gray present for the wisdom and magic; and an innocent hobbit leaving his Shire to see for the very first time the dark side, full of orcs and goblins, of the Middle Earth. Everything is here and is shown in a period of almost three hours too; though I felt them as one and a half hour, which is again an indication that, no matter what, Jackson gave us some good entertainment. <br/><br/>""Hobbit 1"" ain't a brilliant masterpiece; it doesn't have battles with moments as memorable and meaningful as the death of Boromir from the last part of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" (nor characters that stand out from the rest; I'm talking in specific of the dwarfs, hoping that they get better in the next movies). Also, I can't ignore all the visual problems already mentioned. But nevertheless it's a movie that accomplishes its main goal of leaving the viewer with desires of watching the second part of the new Peter Jackson trilogy about the world of Tolkien. <br/><br/>*Watched it on 14 December, 2012"

","This film is about the Hobbit named Bilbo gets involved in the fight for survival with the Dwarfs in the Middle Kingdom.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" were talked about by many people around me, but somehow there is not as much hype compared to the other ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. One thing people talked about was that the faster frame rate gave many people headaches because the brain could not process so much information. I watched it at the normal frame rate so I had no headaches.<br/><br/>I normally do not understand a thing in a fantasy film, but ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was straightforward and simple enough for me to completely understand the plot. At over 2 hours, the pace could be quicker, and some subplots could be edited out. Nevertheless, I did not feel bored at all by the film. The special effects are very good, and the 3D is convincing as well. The characters are well designed, and I was especially impressed by the astounding grace of Galadriel, played by Cate Blanchett. The subplot about Bilbo's unexpected bravery is very satisfying to watch as well. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is interesting and entertaining, and I may give ""The Lord of the Rings"" series another chance if the next Hobbit is as good as this."

","Note: I saw this in the intended HFR 3D Format. <br/><br/>The Good Overall I really enjoyed it. Martin Freeman was perfect Gandalf was perfect Thorin was perfect Gollum's CGI was a lot better than the original trilogy Scenic shots were majestic<br/><br/>The Bad Definitely dragged in many bits. I felt at least 20-30 mins could be cut out and the film would benefit from it and feel a lot more coherent. For example I didn't think the Radagast scene added much at all. Also the battle in the Goblin lair, while a lot of fun, just seemed to go on forever. Bilbo's interaction with Gollum too seemed to drag a bit, I felt that scene could have been interspersed with the Dwarfs battling the Goblins just to change things up a bit<br/><br/>The CGI apart from Gollum was a big step down from the original. Problem compounded/highlighted by the HFR. Azog looked like he came out of a video game - after seeing the amazing practical effects heavy orcs in the original, that was a pretty glaring drop in quality/believability for me. <br/><br/>The Ugly I can't say enough about how silly and unnatural the HFR makes certain scenes look. Any shots of Bilbo walking about in the Shire at his home looked absolutely hilariously bad I have to say. Looked super sped up. So too did a LOT of the aerial panning shots, looked like the crane/helicopter was in a bit of a hurry most of the time. <br/><br/>In non-motion heavy scenes the HFR no doubt gives a really great sense of reality and that looking out the window kind of effect, so that's what it's got going for it on the + side. But when things start moving it really is bad. Looks worse than cheap TV films. <br/><br/>The Meh The score. There was the one main new theme which is the song the Dwarfs sing. It's a great theme and very memorable, but it re-occurs far too often for my liking. I was expecting there to be some more new stuff but most of it apart from that sounded like a re-tread of the original trilogy score. <br/><br/>Overall purely on the quality of the film, i'd give it a 8.5/10. Very good, very enjoyable. But not quite up to the originals. I understand this is not meant to be as epic a tale and the tone is meant to be different etc, but it doesn't make for as compelling a film, especially with what is IMO an over-stretched run-time. <br/><br/>Accounting for the HFR and CGI issues though, I would be forced to take my score down to an 8."

","I thought this movie was OK, but I only think that's because I watched the Lord of the Rings when I was 5 and can hardly remember anything about it at all. Plus fantasy films aren't my thing. However my mother who happens to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan loved the movie.<br/><br/>I do have to give the movie props for the cinematography. I mean, oh my God, the visuals are beautiful!! All of the images are so clear and crisp, I literally felt like I was right there with Bilbo. I especially love the Elf kingdom and the graphics for that are amazing. I can't even explain with words how beautiful the imagery and 3D are in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. There are a few things that bothered me about the visuals though. Some of it is almost too perfect and too clear. You can see every piece of grass in the field and every pore or drop of sweat on the Dwarfs. It is a bit too much. The other thing that pulled me away from the movie is how the Orcs look. They look like video game characters and they don't have the same quality of the rest of the CGI in the film.<br/><br/>My favorite character in The Hobbit is, by far, Gollum. Even though he is only in one scene of this movie, he is really funny in a creepy way. I really want to go back and re-watch the Lord of the Rings just to see more of him! I also like Bilbo Baggins because everyone doubts him, but he never gives up or turns back. My favorite scene is a toss up between when Bilbo meets Gollum and when the Dwarfs are in the underground world of the Goblins. I love when Bilbo meets Gollum because the two of them have a very funny interaction of riddling each other. I also like when the Dwarfs are escaping the Goblins because their world is underground and very rickety.<br/><br/>I think the biggest downside of this movie is the length. It is way too long in my opinion, but then again, all of the Lord of the Rings films have been very long as well. If you enjoy the Lord of the Rings then you will love The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, but will I see it again? No. So, I will say the cinematography deserves 5 out of 5 stars but, the overall film only gets 3.5 out of 5 from me.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"

While treading familiar territory for fan boys including some incredible set pieces (plenty of Orc battles YES!) the film is not an instant classic as its fore bearers largely due to the too many characters (a baker's dozen of regrettably forgettable dwarfs - sorry it's true) and very little darkness that permeated the previous trilogy. Still for epic filmmaking Jackson is in a class by himself reunited with Philppa Boyens and Fran Walsh (co-scripting with once-attached-to-helm Guillermo del Toro) and state-of-the-art CGI still non-paraleil (*I did see this in IMAX 3D however not in the new format where the FPS have been tinkered with)."

","It had been nine years since The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, based on the famous J.R.R. Tolkien books, had come to an end, and naturally the prequel book had to be made as well, this was the first of three (originally two) parts from returning director Peter Jackson (originally Guillermo del Toro, who dropped out and became writer instead). Basically the film opens in the Shire with hobbit Old Bilbo (Sir Ian Holm) on his 111th birthday beginning his book about his adventures, and his nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) is keen to read it, and this is when the film flashbacks to sixty years to the beginning to this story, where a precious treasure is to lost to the arrival of Smaug the Dragon, and when Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) got no help from the elves in the battle he gained a lasting hatred for them. Young Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is tricked by wizard Gandalf the Grey (Sir Ian McKellen) to hosting a party for a company of dwarfs, Balin (Ken Stott), Dwalin (Graham McTavish), Fíli (Dean O'Gorman), Kíli (Being Human's Aidan Turner), Dori (Mark Hadlow), Nori (Jed Brophy), Ori (Adam Brown), Óin (John Callen), Glóin (Peter Hambleton), Bifur (William Kircher), Bofur (James Nesbitt) and Bombur (Stephen Hunter), of course the real point of this is recruit Bilbo for a quest. They plan to steal the treasure back from the dragon, with Bilbo as the ""burglar"", and for a while he refuses to have any part of it, but he changes his mind knowing he needs to see the world, in the group the leader Thorin is the only one who is doubtful he will be any help to them. On their journey the company get captured by trolls until they are stopped being turned to stone when the sun rises, finding a cave they come across some small treasure and lost Elven blades that prove useful, including the one that glows when Orcs are close, wizard Radagast the Brown (Doctor Who's Sylvester McCoy) tells that the forest is being taken over by dark magic, and they enter the Elven city of Rivendell and tell the situation to Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and wizard Saruman the White (Sir Christopher Lee). The Morgul-blade they found means the Witch-king of Angmar is returning to Middle Earth and may use Smaug the dragon for some evil intent, after this Gandalf stays behind while Bilbo and the Dwarfs continue toward the Misty Mountains, where they end up in the middle of a battle between Stone Giants, and get captured by Goblins. While the Dwarfs encounter the leader of the goblins, the Great Goblin (Barry Humphries), Bilbo is separated from them and falls into the deeps of the caves, and he encounters Gollum (Andy Serkis), who drops a mysterious ring, which is of course the One Ring forged by the dark lord Sauron. Defending himself with his newfound glowing sword, Bilbo and Gollum play a game of riddles, where if Bilbo wins he will be allowed to find a way out, and if Gollum wins he can eat Bilbo, the hobbit wins by asking what is in his pocket, and that is when the creature turns realising it is his ring. Running from the furious Gollum he unintentionally finds that the ring causes him to become invisible, and before escaping he considers killing the creature, but changes his mind in pity, while Gandalf arrives to save the others, and they are all reunited to escape the evil army, including the return of Thorin's great enemy, Azog the Orc war-chief (Manu Bennett) who is still alive. The group get away from the enemy climbing the trees, but fire breaks out and there is nowhere else to go, but Gandalf summoned the Eagles to save them, and they fly away to the safety of Carrock, Thorin accepts Bilbo as part of the group for saving his life, and they all see their destination, the Lonely Mountain, in the distance, and there Smaug beneath the lost treasure has awakened. Freeman is likable as the nervous but reliable hero, McKellen still proves a wonderful choice for the good wizard, and many of the supporting cast members as dwarfs prove great fun, it is admittedly not as sweeping as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was, but the special effects are still amazing, the scene between Bilbo and Gollum is the most engaging part, and there are the action packed sequences to keep you happy, a most worthwhile fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Make Up & Hair, Sound and Special Visual Effects. Good!"

","A long time has passed since the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor has been conquered by a fearsome dragon. Fearing what could happen should this dragon be controlled by the enemy, Gandalf the Grey readies to reclaim Erober with the help of 13 dwarfs, led by the great dwarf warrior Thorin. But before they embark of this journey, Gandalf feels the need to recruit the help of a lowly hobbit Bilbo, who is swept into an adventure of a lifetime. As they begin this quest Bilbo encounters a creature that possesses a seemingly harmless gold ring. Little does he know it will eventually determine the fate of all in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>One of my major problems with this film is the pacing; it's just way too slow. I don't think anything of significance happened in the first 3rd of the film, which is unacceptable for a nearly 3 hour movie. I really felt like it was dragging on, and on in the beginning so much so I left theatre to pick up some Twizzlers because I was that bored. I never do that during great movie as I'm usually really engulfed in the film and the characters. This did not happen (for most of the movie anyway).<br/><br/>I have to assume this is a direct consequence of Jackson milking this into three films. Their making three films out of one book and after seeing this film, there doesn't appear to be enough material to make three great movies. And to be honest, the story this time is not quite as compelling as the original LOTR trilogy. In the original trilogy, the fate of all middle earth hung in the balance. In this film, well, not so much. Now it's not all bad, the film does explore some other areas of Middle Earth. I really enjoyed the extra added detail on the Dwarfs and Goblins, something the trilogy didn't spend a lot of time on. And of course, the added development and cameos of the integral characters from the trilogy. The fantasy world of Middle Earth is still very appealing and this film did will enough to expand on it.<br/><br/>One of the stronger parts of the film are the performances. Ian McKellan plays Gandalf with his usual strong presence and authority. Martin Freeman is very good as Bilbo who goes from cautiously timid early in the film, to surprisingly brave in the end. But I really liked Richard Armitage as Thorin. He was clearly the most interesting character in the film and one of the few bright spots in my opinion. However, outside of Bilbo and Thorin, I wasn't really that much interested in any of the new characters, even with the added time to develop some back story for them.<br/><br/>There were a few nice battle sequences to keep you entertained, although I wished I had seen more (or more accurately, any) of the dragon. This was clearly a tease for the other 2 films and very disappointing. The special effects were improved, but not enough to really blow you away. I kind of felt like I had seen it before, but this takes nothing away from how great they were in the original trilogy. I saw this version of the film in IMAX 3D at 48 frames per second and I really didn't like. I felt like I was watching those early LCD TVs that had motion handling that made the movie feel almost soap opera ish. I'm hoping this is trend that doesn't continue in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I think everyone wanted to love this film. It's the Lord of the Rings prequel. It's Peter Jackson. We get to relive the epic fantasy world we fell in love with a decade ago. Unfortunately, the film has too much filler and just isn't that good; especially when compared to the brilliance of the original trilogy. The Hobbit is somewhat of an expected disappointment.<br/><br/>www.themoviesnob.ca<br/><br/>@the_movie_snob"

"infoalwaysacritic","8","1","4","3 January 2016"," An odd mix, but wildly entertaining film
","It always gets a little funny when making a film based on a book. What stays? What is lost? The fact of the matter is that there will always be new things and things lost because books will almost always convey a story using different tools. The Hobbit takes this to the extreme, even when viewing their extended editions.<br/><br/>Far from utilizing different tools to tell the story, the Hobbit hints that the producers were interested in telling a very different story from the book, while being confused about who they were trying to reach. Awe over the excitement of once again seeing Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth on the big screen once again, gives way to awkward confusion when childish slapstick routines are played against gore and violence that puts the Lord of the Rings movies well in the past. This isn't something that creeps up on you either, but is played out early in the film. Gone is the childish innocence of the book, that allows the child's mind to invent the details of the tale. In its place is an awkwardly mature adventure that suffers from gaping plot holes, large enough to fit the obscenely large realization of Smaug.<br/><br/>Even with the extreme degree of characterization, time line and effects that are inflated to make this short book into a 9+ hour experience, the Hobbit can be embraced for what it is. It succeeds at telling the original story, or this part of it, along with embellishing many new figments of the production team's imagination into the production. There are bound to be people who don't appreciate those additions, but they are entertaining for those that want to experience them.<br/><br/>In addition to seeing this film in 3D, in the theatre, and the extended editions, I deliberately chose to read the book afterwards, and not before. To offer a comparison, I would say that while Peter Jackson's rendition is grossly inflated, it is no less bizarre than the original telling. If anything, there are several places where the producers played things down a notch; Beorn's homestead for example was originally a glimpse into Narnia with talking animals that walked upright and delivered tea. With this in mind, I have thoroughly enjoyed the ludicrous trip into the crazy that these films provide."

"JTurner82","8","1","4","19 December 2014"," Well executed and good fun overall, but also quite long. Best when it follows the story.
","More than seventy years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a story called ""The Hobbit"", in which the title character somehow gets mixed up with a bunch of dwarfs to reclaim missing treasure. The success and acclaim of this book led to the highly acclaimed ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which years later was transformed into one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time by Peter Jackson. It was perhaps inevitable that one day Jackson would return to this territory to tackle the trials of Bilbo Baggins, but because this movie follows on the heels of a towering achievement like the LORD OF THE RINGS films, comparisons are bound to be inevitable.<br/><br/>Adding to the burden of the brunt is the controversial decision to extend THE HOBBIT into a trilogy. That approach worked ideally well for Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but because THE HOBBIT is a considerably shorter book (more like one third of the trilogy), it doesn't really merit the decision for three two-and-a-half hour movies. A more ideal approach would have been to film the book as a two-part series, not a trilogy. On a technical level there's nothing majorly wrong with Jackson's direction; the casting and performances are both excellent, the cinematography breathtaking as always, and the visual effects, for the most part, are as impressive as ever. The problem is that the movies are just too unnecessarily long.<br/><br/>In fact, it takes a whopping 45 minutes to get Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) out of his cozy home in Hobbiton to go out on his fateful quest with the eponymous wizard Gandalf (Ian MacKellen), as well as a pack of dwarfs led by a brooding fellow named Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage). En route, we first see a lengthy, ten-minute prologue in which the old Bilbo (played with a wavering sincerity by Ian Holm) begins writing his book about his adventures, starting with the downfall of the Dwarven city of Erebor. The subsequent half hour is basically the first chapter, in which Bilbo's quiet humble life is turned upside down when the dwarfs intrude into his household and take over his pantry in no time. The nature of this scene is also noticeably more lighthearted than even the prologue of the first RINGS film, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. In all fairness, the tone of Tolkien's HOBBIT is more of a children's story and what's on the screen is more or less true to the original, but it also requires a subjective approach. Fans familiar with the book will get the gist of it and more or less be fine, but for more antsy audience members, it does require patience to sit through this scene.<br/><br/>Extending scenes like this aren't the only aesthetic choices that Jackson chooses to approach when tackling the story to screen. Sometimes he ends up culling information from the footnotes of Tolkien's fantasy, even borrowing bits of THE SIMILARION for good measure. For instance, we meet the wizard Radagast, an eccentric fellow who cares for animals and goes around riding on a massive ""rabbit"" sleigh. There is also a shady backstory involving a conflict between Thorin against a nasty-looking orc named Azgog (a mostly computer-animated villain with a vicious grin and a prosthetic arm). Finally we get a surprisingly long scene at the Elven city of Rivendell in which Gandalf converses with his colleague, the ill-fated sorcerer Saruman (Christopher Lee) about the potential return of Sauron. This is obviously meant to tie THE HOBBIT into THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, which is understandable because this is, after all, a prequel, but again, whether one is willing to sit through such slow scenes depends on the nature.<br/><br/>THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY really comes to life during the bits when it actually sticks to the story. The sequence where Bilbo and company are captured by giant trolls does justice to the book. In the second half, we get a scarifying roller-coaster style confrontation with two stone giants to a visit to the infamous Goblin City, ruled by a bloated fellow called the Goblin King. But the film's real highlight is the ""Riddles in the Dark"" sequence, a cunningly choreographed, thrilling confrontation in which Bilbo must outsmart the twisted Gollum (again brought to life by the remarkable motion capture and hoarse voice of Andy Serkis).<br/><br/>While Jackson's choices may be questionable for some, to his credit, the man hasn't lost his ability to extol performances from his cast. Freeman was practically born to play Bilbo, embuing the character's neurotic reluctance with a charm that easily makes even the slowest parts of the film tolerable to sit through. Armitage mostly portrays Thorin as a grumpy, dour fellow who doubts his new charge, but he does so with hints of a tortured personality. Sylvestor McCoy is also quite good as the eccentric Radagast, and the dwarfs are all well cast and fitting for their roles. And of course, it's gratifying to see McKellan, Lee, Serkis, and even Cate Blanchett (as Galadriel) reprise their roles.<br/><br/>Is this HOBBIT trilogy on par with the original LORD OF THE RINGS? No. But it's still well-made and executed with a style that only Jackson can do. In short, whether you decide that THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is for you depends on how much you are willing to overlook the eccentric decision to extend what is essentially a shorter story and embark on another adventure. Having said that, though, I still quite enjoyed the movie and if nothing else, it left me eager for the next chapter."
"caseynicholson","7","1","4","18 December 2014"," A Film that is Faithful to the Book
","The first thing that you need to know about ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is that this first in Peter Jackson's three-part ""Hobbit"" film series is a movie that is very faithful to the book. However, there are caveats to that.<br/><br/>For example, some might argue that Jackson's ""Hobbit"" film is not really all that faithful to Tolkien's book at all. The movie certainly does expand on Tolkien's work, introducing a new chapter into the story that is only mentioned tangentially in the book. In addition, the film explains some details of the story in its first scenes that the book does not deal with until much later. This expansive nature of the film and creative license in how the story is told could be a turn off for Tolkien purists.<br/><br/>Still, the fact remains that this film does take great pains to be faithful to the original source material, and in doing so the final product is a bit of a risky movie venture--risky in the sense that some may not enjoy the nature of the film in the same way that they might enjoy the same story in written form.<br/><br/>For example, one thing that one has to keep in mind when viewing ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is that the film is modeled on a book that is meant to be young-adult fiction, albeit one that was written in a day and age when that category was less popular (or less overtly categorized) than it is today. As such, one must realize that the source material for the film is a children's book that features goblins and dwarfs, and that the book is meant to appeal to pre-teens and teens that are at one and the same time young enough to appreciate adolescent humor and thrills, and yet also mature enough to appreciate battles where goblins and orcs are beheaded.<br/><br/>Jackson's film illustrates this perplex source material quite well, as the movie both has its moments in which it is easy to see how it is meant to appeal to young viewers, and yet at the same time it features somewhat graphic depictions of grisly battle scenes all at the same time.<br/><br/>This is what makes the film risky. The odd mix of adolescent humor and adventure along with more mature themes makes for a story that seems hard to categorize, and hard to imagine where the line might be drawn between fairy tale and mature fantasy.<br/><br/>Still, as with the book, the film has major appeal. But there are more caveats.<br/><br/>For example, one must realize that in being true to the book, the film certainly takes some risk by being drawn out and erratic. For example, the scene early in the film in which the dwarfs are dining with Bilbo and attempting to persuade him to come on a journey with them is indeed quite an accurate depiction of the same scene from the book. However, in the film that scene seems to drag on for quite some time, making it a risky exercise in literary fidelity.<br/><br/>The same is true for the film's hopscotch of battle scenes and grandiose episodes as the group sets out on its journey. The movie certainly runs the risk of being seen as a never-ending shifting of dramatic episodes--but, to anyone who has ever read the book, it's obvious that this is yet another way in which the film is being very faithful to its source.<br/><br/>All that said, when viewing ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", one may walk away with a poor view of the film if you were hoping for a more succinct, straight forward fantasy account. I know that when I first saw the film during its theatrical release, I was a bit unsettled with the impression that it had left me with. <br/><br/>However, having seen it more than once now, and having now been able to see it as a predecessor to its (far superior) sequel, I now have a much more robust appreciation for the film. It's a grand story that seeks to be faithful to the book by presenting a young adult fantasy theme that is suited for children who are coming of age. If you're able to let go of your adulthood for a few hours and view the film through the eyes of a ten year old, that may help you enjoy the film. And if you should happen to read the book before viewing the ""Hobbit"" series, that may help your appreciation even more.<br/><br/>Overall I'd give it 7/10 stars."
"orourkec-292-269155","7","1","4","18 December 2014"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected journey fails to meet all expectations but it still has success.
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is flawed and doesn't reach the heights of the Lord of the Rings but it nevertheless succeeds at offering us a lot of good things. The visual effects and CGI landscape on screen look absolutely and attractively beautiful and we instantly want to be in the adventure because of this. Storytelling and the way it is told in the picture is compelling. Absolutely everyone is impressively well cast in the film and exactly the way you would want them to look like as their characters. Not a single one in the film is not cast well. I'm moreover highly impressed by the Dwarfs being shown as very spirited in the film and it made them highly believable and memorable characters. I thought that the creature Gollum makes a welcome reappearance. The Trolls-Hobbit-Dwarfs scene was another scene I really liked because it was very ambitious. I also really liked the Battle-of-the-Rocks scene - it was amazingly fun, technically inventive and well executed. The problem about this movie however is that it is not pumped with full of life and energy enough. Another problem is the plot and the problem about this plot is the following: alright the plot is about a group of Dwarfs who are trying to reclaim their homeland from an evil dragon named Smaug. Yes, but then what? Another problem is the action taking place in the Goblins' home as Gandalf and the Dwarfs are trying to escape from the Goblins near the end of the film - that action scene added nothing new to the new Middle Earth trilogy and it lacked skillful entertainment even if few of its scene elements were impressive and stylish. The other problem is the moment in that same scene where Gandalf and the Dwarfs go on an attached wooden ramp which breaks loose and ultimately allows them to escape as it brutally breaks and slides down - this part of the scene looked slightly or a bit too much like a video game act and slightly or a bit unconvincing and childish as well. And the deliberate pacing is also a slight problem in the film. From what I've learned is that making The Hobbit movie was a particularly challenging and intimidating task for Peter Jackson (don't know why) even if he's himself a talented director and he originally intended for someone else to direct The Hobbit because of that but this wasn't possible and therefore he was forced to be the one in charge of the direction for The Hobbit. Poor man. However, after watching The Hobbit movie I thought that Peter Jackson did an impressive effort and that fortunately he managed to do an above-satisfactory job despite the challenge, even if some flaws remained there. Overall, The Hobbit: Unexpected Journey is a stirring adventure film but unfortunately it doesn't accomplish its full purpose. It could have been increasingly better. My rating for the film: 7.2/10"
"bowmanblue","8","1","4","5 September 2014"," An unexpected addition to 'the Rings'
","I read the book of the Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings. When I was a child, I enjoyed its light-hearted approach at introducing 'Middle Earth.' However, when it came to transferring books to films, the Lord of the Rings was certainly a safer bet when it came to box office returns.<br/><br/>Therefore I didn't know what to expect from this 'prequel,' especially as I - like so many fans - were a little sceptical about how and why the producers felt the need to turn a much smaller book into a three-film epic - almost to try and rival the original trilogy.<br/><br/>The good news is that the look and feel of Lord of the Rings is all there when it comes to sets, special effects and even most of the useable cast have returned to play their respective roles again. All the cast do a fine job of portraying their characters - Ian McKellen finds it easiest to play Gandalf, while Martin Freeman has a harder job of playing not only a younger version of Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins, but also to add his own touches to the role (which, I'm pleased to say, he pulls off).<br/><br/>However, most people feel they have been proved right about expanding the original source material so much. There is a lot of 'padding' - mainly at the beginning which simply isn't necessary and can start to get a little boring, bringing the pace down considerably.<br/><br/>Then there's the comedy. Only it's not comedy, it's more out-of-place dialogue that seems way too light-hearted to fit in the Lord of the Rings universe. For every epic battle and great touch The Hobbit offers, there are equal amount of moments that make you cringe and just wish would end as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>I hear there's a director's cut coming out soon and that it's going to be even longer. I feel this is one of the rare occasions where a movie would benefit from a SHORTER director's cut. It's not a bad film. I actually quite liked it and enjoyed seeing my childhood book brought to life with a fitting budget. Just, if you're going to watch it repeatedly, you may want to have one hand on the remote control to gloss over some of the less important scenes which really don't matter and just shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>A good film, possibly only not a great film due to the producers trying to add more material than is necessary simply to justify turning the overall story into a new trilogy.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

I say it kind of makes women in movies nothing but toys, there are movies with lead girls but even they find a toy but most tend to not care for them. As a writer and hoping on making his own stories on screen or at least made onto a website and internet. I want to see unique stories not too complex and not too predictable like every movie. I gave The Hobbit an 8 out of 10 could've been a great movie but like I said, predictable but of course a fun watch.

"oscar-stainton","9","1","4","25 June 2014"," Redux: Worthy Prequel to 'Lord of the Rings'
","This will be a redo of my previous (and frankly immature) review for 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' in which I attempt to assess the film's flaws against its weaknesses. Back in 2012, a few film critics were quick to call this film the 'Phantom Menace' of the LOTR series, and that worried me to my core. But upon watching it for the first time, I fell in love with it as I did with the original trilogy and could not see eye to eye with that negative sentiment. So far, time has done little to dent my love of this first in the Hobbit trilogy.<br/><br/>The story so far is simple; respectable hobbit Bilbo Baggins is invited by the wizard Gandalf the Grey to accompany a band of thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield, the uncrowned king of the dwarfs, to embark on an adventure to take back their lost mountain kingdom of Erebor and the treasure within from a cunning dragon named Smaug. Along the way, the band encounters a trio of hungry trolls, ferocious wargs, lofty elves, troublesome goblin hordes and cruel orcs. Out of his element, Bilbo must use his wits and determination to help the dwarfs reclaim their home and has a chance encounter with a creature that changes the fate of Middle-earth. Meanwhile, Gandalf learns from fellow wizard Radagast that a mysterious Necromancer has taken hold in the forest of Mirkwood and may be responsible for the resurgence of evil creatures in Middle-earth.<br/><br/>All of the actors play their characters to perfection, especially Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Richard Armitage as Thorin. Bilbo wears his personality on his sleeves; he's kind, funny, nervous, and polite to a fault, if a bit prudish, yet he becomes brave and resourceful over time. His modest sensibilities make him very relatable. Thorin is a stubborn, regal, prideful dwarf who holds restoring his people above all else. He comes to respect and even appreciate Bilbo when the hobbit displays a feat of courage in the face of adversity. The standouts among the Dwarfs include Balin, a gentle grandfatherly figure, Dwalin, a gruff and suspicious mass of muscle, Bofur, a jocular and eccentric journeyman, and Fili and Kili, the laddish, loyal nephews of Thorin; all coming across as likable and spirited in their own way. Radagast the Brown; I actually quite like him. Upon hearing the comparisons to Jar-Jar Binks I was once again worried, but now I know this: Radagast is an eccentric hermit who actively assists Gandalf in his missions, Jar-Jar is a babbling idiot; they're as different as a tree to a rubber band. The returning actors step into their parts as though they never left them; Ian McKellan is majestic and endearing as Gandalf, and Andy Serkis slips back into the role of Gollum perfectly.<br/><br/>As for Azog, I honestly would have preferred him to be written out so that Bolg would take his place, but I know why they included him; to be a menace to the dwarfs and work as a pawn of the Nercomancer as the series progresses, but I agree that he and many of his subordinates should not have been CGI creations. However, I don't mind the CGI for the goblins as it gives them a distinctive and overall more vermin-like look. <br/><br/>The prosthetics added to the grittiness of the LOTR trilogy, but with a relatively lighter story in The Hobbit, CGI can lend itself well to creating vast locations and creatures, such as the enormous Stone Giants and Goblin Caves. While I understand that most people are annoyed by excess of CGI when it came to the orcs and some sets, do we really watch these films just for their special effects and makeup artistry alone?<br/><br/>While I can see how many consider the first 40 minutes being too slow, the scenes in Bag End are there to give the audience an understanding of who the Dwarfs are; how they have fun, get serious and interact with the other peoples of Middle-earth; and their history is beautifully represented and gives their quest a sense of purpose. I could plausibly see the opening scenes with Old Bilbo and Frodo omitted, as well as a few minutes of the Bag End party. Peter Jackson has demonstrated a flair for beautiful visuals and it shows; Middle-earth has never looked more vibrant and colourful, giving it a more fable-like appearance, and honestly I think it suits the tone, being lighter than 'Fellowship of the Ring'. Because the story unfolded naturally and allowed characters to breathe, I can forgive the time it takes.<br/><br/>Howard Shore returns to orchestrate The Hobbit, and the 'Misty Mountains Cold' song has been ringing in my mind since I first heard it; equally elegiac and epic. I enjoyed seeing this lighter side of Middle-earth and its charming and adventurous tone was broken only with flashbacks to darker elements such as Smaug's initial attack and Azog's first appearance. This first part feels like an epic fairy tale, depicting a realm at peace, filled with light and wonder. I found Gandalf's speech to Galadriel of why Bilbo is part of Thorin's company due to his kindness and capacity for courage incredibly heart-warming, especially when Gandalf smiles and says that Bilbo gives him courage. I loved Bilbo showing mercy to Gollum knowing how it will affect events in the LOTR trilogy, and I loved the conclusion to Bilbo's arc in helping the Dwarfs before the climax. <br/><br/>Despite deviating from the book in keeping Azog alive and bringing in Radagast as a prominent character, it still kept true to the book's spirit, heart and messages while integrating the wider lore of Middle-earth, preserving the story's sense of wonder. With an adventurous story, fun and relatable characters, solid performances, stunning visuals, a vast and untamed world with a sense of magic and wonder, this first part of the Hobbit is a strong start."
"minorxml","8","1","4","28 January 2014"," For not being an LOTR movie its pretty good
","Well it isn't a bad movie at all neither is it as good as the LOTR movies. But after three movies of LOTR of course there are limitations to what you can do. That and its source material.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a children book that changes the whole situation. While LOTR could easily be for grown ups The Hobbit just is for a younger audience.<br/><br/>The Cinema is great, the audio is well you will hear allot of songs you heard before in LOTR. The characters like gandalf, galadriel and so on add a nice but if quality to the movie. The original characters, the young bilbo it pretty good. Thorin is again pretty good. The rest of the dwarfs isn't as strong.<br/><br/>There are a few very nice scenes and others that are just make your head scratch. The goblin king scenes are not my favourite but I know this will lead to something bigger. I mean jovial singing goblin king that reminds me of a certain person deep in certain woods. Still children story and all! The action still is pretty darn good the fights are awesome. The scenes leading to fights are pretty decent. The drama is there in the movie so as grown up you can enjoy it. There are a few things recurring here. You could see a bit of strider in Thorin in some scenes. Some scenes are almost kinda copied from LOTR in certain ways. There is that vibe like ""Well it was awesome when it happened to aragorn so.. thorin are you up for it?"" I think Bilbo, the young bilbo is a pretty strong character. Well done! Of course meeting smeagol, awesome scene. In part because of we learn how the ring got to bilbo. Also the Necromancer.. lovely foreshadowing.<br/><br/>I am not sure about radagast, but that is a common complaint. Like a certain tom bombadill it just feels a bit well not the level you expected. Still well played. And well we get to see the spiders that is something positive to note right? <br/><br/>I think this is how you should look at this movie. It isn't LOTR, it isn't as good as LOTR, it does re-uses some ideas and things from LOTR. And I don't really see how three movies can be filled. I just don't see it! Also the end, cool smaug doesn't looks to bad even! But the eagles again? Again the eagles.. before the eagles showed up it didn't really feel as Dire as in LOTR III where. Before the eagles showed up it really felt Dire.. and as if the heroes had little chance. Here the heroes are in a dire spot yes but I didn't feel it. I didn't feel the need to get the eagles out.<br/><br/>But hey the movie is good, it is for younger children and there is some belching and children friendly humor in it. But also fighting which is awesome.<br/><br/>So no complaints here but I fear for part II. I haven't watched it yet. And if this is the begin movie mmm I see problems rising.<br/><br/>I think that indeed if one is to accept that this does takes place in the same world and is partly connected to the events in LOTR. It still isn't as good. <br/><br/>But is it good as movie on itself YES."
"grantss","5","1","4","26 January 2014"," Visually stunning, and that's it
","Meh. The Lord of the Rings trilogy should have prepared me for this: stunning visual effects but not much else. <br/><br/>Long rambling linear story, filled with nick-of-time savings from death by randomly introduced forces. Plus, goes on forever, and you have to get through two more of these before you get a conclusion (screw that!). Yep, pretty much Lord of the Rings all over again.<br/><br/>At 9 hours or so in total, this series of movies will go down in history as the first time ever a book was quicker to read than the adapted movie was to watch...<br/><br/>However, kids will love it (though the movie's length may hinder that), as will nerds."
"two-cents-worth","8","1","4","15 January 2014"," Fantastic movie (once I got past being dense)
","It is always difficult to admit being dense, but I was.<br/><br/>On the first viewing, I was disappointed in this film. I am a great fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and was expecting something quite similar. However, this film does not have the intensity of The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>It was that lack of intensity that gave rise to my disappointment.<br/><br/>After an additional viewing, I adjusted to the tone of the movie which was so different. Then it struck me that I completely missed a key thematic element of the film (dumb). Bilbo states this as clearly as possible -'I'm going on an adventure'. Yeesh! This is an adventure film and not a war film as was the Lord of the Rings. So of course it is less intense.<br/><br/>I stand in awe of Peter Jackson's (and co-creators) ability to so subtly create the mood and tone exactly appropriate to the nature of the tale.<br/><br/>With my initial disappointment set aside, I could fully appreciate the extraordinary skill and talent that went into making the movie. For me, Lord of the Rings is the high water mark of movie making. This film reaches that same level of excellence. Peter Jackson has created a visually and musically beautiful film, every bit on a par with LoR and once again demonstrated his consummate ability as a storyteller.<br/><br/>Martin Freemans' performance deserves special notice. He is a master in the use of body language to convey thoughts and emotions. Think of the scene were it is the morning after the dwarfs invade Bilbo's home for dinner. Without a word being spoken, he speaks volumes as he treads carefully though the house checking on the status of his uninvited guests. The only equivalent use of body language that comes to my mind is Sandra Bullock in 'While You Were Sleeping'.<br/><br/>This movie stands shoulder to shoulder with the heretofore matchless Lord of the Rings."
"craig-hopton","8","1","4","6 January 2014"," Excellent addition to the franchise
","More great stuff from this franchise. They really do an excellent job of recreating the world of Middle Earth to spectacular effect and (nine times out of ten) just as you'd imagined it from the books.<br/><br/>But before I wax lyrical about The Hobbit, let me mention a couple of things that I *don't* like. Firstly, I was really disappointed with the job they did with the dwarfs. Most of them simply don't look like dwarfs! They just look like shrunk humans. Some of them - Thorin in particular - look tall and slim. How annoying! Secondly, I thought they lost a bit of the humour that I remember from reading The Hobbit. The scene where the dwarfs arrive at Bilbo's house and the episode with the trolls were laugh-out-loud funny in the book; not here.<br/><br/>Aside from those points, however, this movie is excellent. It moves along at a quick pace. Martin Freeman is simply superb as Bilbo Baggins (much better than Elijah Wood was as Frodo). The landscape and special effects are just as phenomenal as in Lord of the Rings. The scene with Gollum rivals the best scenes of the whole franchise.<br/><br/>One final point. There's numerous instances where they've added to the story that was in the book, in fact they've even introduced some completely new characters. Some people won't like this but personally I think it helps with the transition from page to screen and I didn't mind at all."
"tardisbond1250","9","1","4","5 January 2014"," The Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey-SPOILER REVIEW
","Okay so Peter Jackson returns to Middle-Earth with The Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey, which is part 1 of a trilogy which tells the story of Bilbo Baggins who is swept into an epic quest in order to help 13 dwarfs reclaim their homeland from Smaug the dragon. Well The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was a massive success so the pressure was on to make The Hobbit just as good. The Hobbit is being adapted as a trilogy from a 300 page book. Judging by the film's run time you can tell that it is very risky to make a 2hr 49min (well 3hr 2min for the extended cut) out of the first 6 chapters of a 300 page book. However the filmmakers have added events from the appendices which are extra notes on certain events and characters that happen/appear during the time line of The Hobbit.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey starts out with a prologue which gives you the basic premise of what happened and then after the prologue we spend quite a while in the Shire. I have to say the Shire scenes are nice. People complain that the Shire scenes are too slow. I disagree because the filmmakers want the audience to get to know the characters, otherwise we would just be watching random people experiencing these mortal situations. So we get nice character development, where we are introduced to Bilbo Baggins(Martin Freeman), Gandalf(Ian McKellen) and the 13 Dwarfs. Then after we finish in the Shire the adventure begins and the film moves at a pretty rollicking pace considering how much they are adapting and how long the film is. We are also introduced to Radagast the Brown(Sylvester McCoy) who is another wizard. He is very strange but likable nonetheless though his appearance is very brief. The action scenes themselves are very great and tense. The scene with the trolls felt very comedic and I though it was constructed extremely well. What was impressive was that the scene built up from being comedic to a very epic action scene with a very impressive soundtrack. The Warg chase is thrown in there just for the sake of it just to have a bit more action just to keep the pace moving quickly. The action in the Goblin's Lair is breathtaking with impressive camera shots and great soundtrack. The climax is enthralling and intense with some fabulous moments. They have turned a simple chapter in the book into an epic climax for the first film. There are other great moments such as Rivendell. It is nice to revisit some iconic locations from the Lord of the Rings and Rivendell is gorgeous to look at just as in Lord of the Rings. It is also nice to have some cameos from past characters such as Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman and of course Gollum. Now, The riddles scene was classic and the best scene of the film. Andy Serkis is a delight to watch as he reprises his role. It is cleverly written and the whole entire screenplay is pretty damn good come to think of it. I thought the acting in this film is astonishing. Martin Freeman is a great Bilbo and you really believe that his character has changed by the end of the film. The ending is pretty great with the tease of Smaug waking up. My only real criticism is that I wish there was less cgi and more prosthetics as I really admired the prosthetics on Lord of the Rings a lot.<br/><br/>Overall The Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic film. A great start to what will be a very good trilogy. Hooked from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Overall 9 out of 10."
"Peter62009","9","1","4","30 December 2013"," Thoughts on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
","Thoughts on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug<br/><br/>Though I am no die-hard fan of The Lord of the Rings and its companion, The Hobbit, I was pleasantly surprised and amazed by the latest instalment of ""The Hobbit"" series. The plot of the film was able to effectively turn a classic ""Hero vs Villain"" story into an extraordinary tale with deeper meanings, making it so much more than just a children's book. The scenery of the movie was almost just as riveting as the narrative, set in the beautiful and exotic wilderness of New Zealand. Even though there were some confusion about the characters' actions in the story, overall ""The Hobbit"" is definitely a film worth seeing.<br/><br/>In the eyes of most directors, filming such a tale in a way that would be both financially feasible and inspire a large fan following would have been deemed close to impossible. Not only was the book long and sometimes repetitive, it also had a somewhat simple storyline. Despite the challenge, Peter Jackson was able to skillfully weave an emotional and meaningful tale that encompassed the incredible and mysterious life of Bilbo Baggins. <br/><br/>This mesmerizing and exciting adventure began with Bilbo's decision to leave the comfort and sanctuary of his home back in Bag End and embark on an epic journey with the dwarfs and Gandalf in order to do something worthwhile and to be an adventurer. As the story progresses, the group started to lose its cohesion after Gandalf's departure and Bilbo soon took the helm as leader, urging everyone not to give up and assisted them no matter how difficult the situation became. This was a major change to the shy and nervous Bilbo in the first Hobbit movie, making it a clear metaphor that even people who appears to be weak at the start could end up becoming great leaders. Throughout Bilbo's odyssey, he showed a deep sense of compassion to his companions and frequently placed his life on the line to save them, making him well loved by his comrades. It was in this respect that Bilbo appeared to have become a lot more responsible and mature compared to before, making him a much more lovable character than he had been previously. This change also symbolized the fact that true heroes care for their friends and help them no matter the circumstance. As for the storyboard, it was significantly darker than the novel, with scary orcs, gruesome monsters, and plenty of tense moments. However, Peter Jackson was able to skillfully balance between light and dark, putting lots of humour at precise moments in the movie so that it offsets the scary atmosphere that occurs so frequently from time to time. Even so, there were less joyful moment as there had been in the previous movie, setting a slightly more serious tone to the film.<br/><br/>While some movies depend on the script and others on the scenery, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is one of the rare movies that take in the best of both worlds, resulting in a cinematic masterpiece not seen in years. Filmed in the vast and colourful wilderness of New Zealand, the audience are given a big treat for their eyes as they watch Bilbo and his buddies flee from orcs across sweeping fields of grass; full off a daring escapade from the elves by swimming through large freshwater rivers; face off against horrific monsters in a vast, sweeping forest of red maple. Not only did the lush scenery make the film so much more engaging, it also caused the story to be so much more immersive. The characters felt more animate and human-like with the realism, enabling the audience to connect to and feel for them so much easier. <br/><br/>However, like all great films The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug still have some slight issues. For instance, Gandalf's actions in this story were quite strange and were never explained throughout the film, leaving viewers baffled and at a loss for an answer. <br/><br/>With all this beauty and meaning that the movie brings, the audience will surely relate to the struggles of the characters; cheer when they overcome adversity, and join the millions of The Hobbit fans awaiting for the next and final chapter of this amazing series."

","I watched the preview extended version of this and must say it is far better than the cinema cut.<br/><br/>It fills in the gaps and character development is far better. You get a real feel of what Tolkien was thinking in his character development.<br/><br/>There are elements that have more action sequences and go more into what happened to the dwarfs. Also there are longer conversations at Rivendell.<br/><br/>In addition to this there are some really funny scenes. Watch out for the Dwarfs depleting the Elf kitchens of wine, as well as deciding to take a naked bath in the Elf water fountain. The hilarious sight of naked Dwarf but is worth paying the fee for the Blu-ray.<br/><br/>The extended version is a must buy for Blu-ray. It's on my list to buy."

","I have to be honest, I probably never would have watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy if it wasn't for the Top 250. With all three in the top 20 and then I saw the boxset and bought it and now I love it. <br/><br/>Same situation with The Hobbit. It first came out and I thought it's not my thing, and then I noticed that it was in the Top 250 and I thought that if it's that highly rated then I should probably watch it. Now I've watched it and I am now a huge LOTR and Hobbit fan.<br/><br/>It's got one of my favourite English actors starring in it, Martin Freeman, and obviously a lot of the main cast from LOTR. It's brilliant and very well written and also great acting. I haven't red any of J.R.R Tolkein's tales about elfs, dwarfs, Orcs etc. but I love this film and it will always be with me as will the LOTR trilogy. <br/><br/>It is a must watch for people who love and loath The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Peter Jackson done well for LOTR (And won an Academy Award for directing) and he has done it again with The Hobbit. <br/><br/>The visual effects are absolutely stunning. The locations in the movie just make the world more realistic and stunning than ever before. There are so many different creatures and monsters which just makes it a fun and amazing ride for all ages who watch the movie.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next two Hobbit sequels coming in December 2013 and 2014. It should have been nominated for more Academy Awards and should have won the awards it was nominated for. A must watch!"

Yes, I have read The Hobbit many times. Yes, Peter Jackson changed and heavily ""added"" but in the end he crafted a masterpiece - and I for one longingly await the second installment. Could this have been done in two movies? Sure. But it was not. At least you are getting your money's worth with these films.

"verena2608","7","1","4","23 June 2013"," Entertaining
","I'm one of the biggest Lord of the Rings fans imaginable, actually I spent my entire youth in Middle Earth and some part of me is probably still there. You can imagine how much I looked forward to seeing hobbits, elves and dwarfs back on screen. Naturally I had to be a little disappointed about the Hobbit.<br/><br/>When watching the Lord of the Rings, it all seems natural to me, it really soaks me in, I'm part of that movie. The Hobbit was entertaining too, but I watched it as an outsider and didn't feel like a part of Middle Earth this time.<br/><br/>It is a lot of special effects - too much for me. In the Lord of the Rings, the orcs were played by real humans wearing costumes. They seemed to be so real and they were scary just as the black riders. In the Hobbit, the orcs and foes are animated, it's like in the new Star Wars movies. It touches you, yes, but you are no longer a part of it.<br/><br/>If you read the book you know how short it is and that there is no way of making three movies out of that material. So Peter Jackson and his team had to find some new aspects to it and take them further.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is no longer the center of the story. He is the main character, yes, but the new tragic hero is Thorin. He, the heir of the throne wants to claim back what is his. In order to make him stand out from the other dwarfs, he was given a look that reminds me a little of Aragorn. The difference between him and Strider is only that Thorin wants to claim back his heritage and Aragorn needs a few battles to realize he has to make a choice and take back the throne.<br/><br/>Also the Wizard Radagast who does not even show up in the book has his own story fighting the Necromancer which does not come up in the book, too. It's entertaining to see Radagast and Thorin (the hero) but it's not what you might expect from the book.<br/><br/>To sum it up: some of the scenes really are too long. Orcs hunting the dwarfs through tunnels - that's just unnecessary as well as huge stone monsters fighting. I guess it's supposed to be impressive but to me it's too much special effects.<br/><br/>The story is good, the actors are brilliant but the new hobbit-look is not as natural as the Lord of the Rings."
"dragokin","6","1","4","20 April 2013"," i guess we got spoiled by The Lord of the Rings
","I remember how bringing The Lord of the Rings to the screen proved difficult due to the sheer quantity of material offered in the literary template. The trilogy was a logical choice, yet even then a lot of condensing was needed.<br/><br/>In that sense, i was surprised to hear that The Hobbit would be a trilogy, as well. I mean, how to you stretch a booklet to three feature films? After all, movies are not made purely for our viewing pleasure, but to make money and feed millions working in the film industry.<br/><br/>In the end, the first Hobbit movie is good fun. There are some obvious fillers, some of the action sequences being among them. Watching in 3D is recommended, otherwise it might be too long to sit through. I guess we simply got spoiled by The Lord of the Rings and it is hard to top that experience now."

Other ""reviewers"" come up with funny puns like ""this was an unexpected disappointment"" guys what are you expecting from this movie? You should accept that this is not The Lord of the Rings, It is a separate movie with it's own story to tell. Other ""Reviewers"" claim the beginning was to long and drawn out, well maybe Just maybe a bit of character development was occurring here, letting the viewer get to know the characters a bit before they set off on their adventures. Lastly I would like to confront the ""reviewers"" who claim that the film is childish, well first and foremost The Hobbit was written as a children's book so perhaps Peter Jackson wanted to stay true to that!<br/><br/>The Hobbit an unexpected Journey is an amazing peace of cinema, especially compared to the rubbish Hollywood is churning out at the moment. The acting is superb, the special effects are out of this world and It tells a fantastic story. This movie draws you into Tolkien's world and take's you on an amazing ride, plus middle earth looks as beautiful as ever.

"raphaklopper","9","1","4","16 April 2013"," ""From the Smallest begins ... Becomes the greatest legend"" Peter Jackson has maken a point on this prhase.
","After The Lord of the Rings (best trilogy ever made), in which each film was truly a masterpiece, rumors emerged years later saying that Peter Jackson would make the movie ""The Hobbit"" inspired by the work of Tolkien, which tells the story before the events of Lord of the Rings, Mr. Jackson denied everything saying it had closed its vision of Middle-earth, and in 2011 the team from the original trilogy was reunited with Peter Jackson at the command, promising a new trilogy.<br/><br/>Months passed and I was dying with anxiety to see the film; trailers for the film appeared; I get even more anxious. And finally ... in December I attended on opening day of ""Un Enexpected Journey"" and was just ... FANTASTIC. I'm still impressed with Peter Jackson, he never disappoints in his films, and this is another proof that he is one of the best directors in the business. And so he remains faithful to Tolkien's work is impressive, clear that this was the 1st film in the trilogy, here we can see the first 6 chapters of the book, it also means that there will be much ahead.<br/><br/>Jackson in this film focuses attention on things that have not been explored much in the Lord of the Rings, the Dwarfs for example, in the Lord of the Rings we only saw one, we see 13 in this one; in the Lord of the Rings we saw an army of goblins, in this one we see an infestation. And it's much more fun, with scenes of dying laughing and you get to love the characters.<br/><br/>The characters are superb, Ian McKellen as Gandalf as always badass and fantastic, Martin Freeman just transform himself to Bilbo (main character), and Andy Serkis as Gollum / Smeagol without words, he is more real than ever. Special effects on top of the range, with extremely epic and fantastic scenes, with a Excellent soundtrack. And always staying faithful to the original trilogy, and books.<br/><br/>A film that in my opinion is for the whole family laugh, have fun, and if you are emotive might even cry."
"mesogeamod","8","1","4","9 April 2013"," Fantastic, yet the plot just needed tightening up.
","Firstly I did not come to Tolkien via the films, but from reading The Hobbit aged about 13 and dozens of times since. Lord of the Rings, again aged 13, about seven or eight times since, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales and just about everything else Tolkien wrote including academic papers.<br/><br/>For me, therefore, this film was a thirty year wait that could hardly fail to bring emotion. It was better than expected, better than hoped for, and yet.......<br/><br/>Read the books and you will see that Tolkien was generally understated in his story telling. Generally things happen that are tightly bound by a sense of reality within a fictional setting. Characters do die and are thus exposed to a certain amount of risk and danger but not to ridiculous extremes. Where Jackson lets us all down is by just pushing things beyond the credible for cinematic drama. Rather than keeping the audience on the edge of their seats by real fear and concern, like a Roller-coaster ride where the rider feels that there actually is some danger (and there is), he gives us a simulated roller-coaster that we all know is perfectly safe but tries to inject thrill by pushing the effects to the occasionally ludicrous.<br/><br/>The slow build up works, because this isn't an instant thrill of a film. It's the first part of a three part epic. It builds as it should. If you want cheap and fast thrills, go see something mindless and bloody.<br/><br/>So what is ludicrous? 1. The Trolls steal ponies, crash through trees, set up camp within spitting distance of the Dwarfs who are settling down to camp in the wild, yet most of the Dwarfs don't hear a thing.<br/><br/>2. Radagast and his Rabbit Sled is a complete invention and a silly departure from the book. Why is the Hedgehog called Sebastian? Even the name Augustus would be too modern for what Tolkien envisaged, an age before History. Radagast needed to be in, but a sledge pulled by deer would have been at least half believable. Why did Radagast lead the Orcs away by going in circles, leading them constantly back to the Dwarfs? All it would have taken is a sentence ""I can't beat their speed but I can outmaneuver them and distract them."" Lazy.<br/><br/>3. The chase under the Misty Mountains, the sheer number of Orcs, falling down chasms and riding a collapsing wooden platform just plumbed the depths of implausibility. It became a pantomime chase, choosing spectacle over drama and action.<br/><br/>4. Stone giants? Vast giants made of stone smashing the mountainside to bits. The pass over the mountains was supposed to be an ancient route and one that is eventually re-opened and made safe when the Orcs are driven out post-Hobbit. Were these stone giants just waiting for this particular night to smash the path to smithereens and most of the mountainside with it? What do they eat, where do they live, what are they doing just sitting around waiting for this particular day. Why were they fighting? Just plain unnecessary, ridiculous and spoiled the film.<br/><br/>5. The Eagles swoop down, save the Dwarfs then drop them at the Carrock without any explanation as to why they didn't just fly to the other side of Mirkwood. Just a short few words between Gandalf and Thorin or Gandalf and the Lord of the Eagles would have sorted it, just as it does in the book. Again, needed tightening up.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved it, but there were times when I muttered, ""Jackson! It was all going so well until you did that!""<br/><br/>90 percent brilliant, fantastic, great, lovely, wonderful. 8 percent ridiculous pantomime that could have and should have been so much better just by being a little less ludicrous. 2 percent tightening up on the script and plot.<br/><br/>With Part Two and Three I just hope that they sleep on some of the decisions to depart from the Books and save the daft bits for the Directors Cut with a warning ""the following bits can be a bit silly""."
"mariamakesmusic","9","1","4","8 April 2013"," Loved it in 3D
","It's not Lord of the Rings and some people who I knew were disappointed with this film's juvenile humour obviously have either not read the book or understood that Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a children's story. I don't think it would be wise to change child's folklore to appease the interest of an adult audience that lends itself well to the Lord of the Rings series. Peter Jackson goes further with this movie than does the actual book, but still in many ways does authentic justice to the characters in this film as they closely match Tolkien's characters as he describes them in the book. I almost wish that Peter Jackson could have done Lord of the Rings now with all the special effects he used for The Hobbit. All the battles or fast action scenes in the Hobbit are done with incredible precision. Many of the battle scenes in Lord of the Rings although extremely well done for that time (early 2000) did not have the detail and precision as did the Hobbit's. Love the book and love the film just as much."
"cosmo_tiger","7","1","4","17 March 2013"," I was not a fan of the original trilogy. That said I did really enjoy this one. More action then walking which helped. I say B+.
","""My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. Well, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it."" Bilbo Baggins (Freeman) is living his life quiet and alone, just like he likes when one day a wizard named Gandolf (Mckellen) shows up with an offer to join him and his group of dwarfs on an adventure. His reluctance finally gives way and he sets out on an adventure that will change his life forever. I have to be honest and admit that I was not a fan of the Lord Of The Rings movies. I thought the first one was boring. The second one to me was a bad remake of Army Of Darkness (I know, go ahead and judge). I did think the third one was OK but not worthy of best picture. All that said I was not looking forward to watching this one. I open with that to say that I actually enjoyed this one. There was actually action in this and not as much constant walking. I know this is a movie people will either see or not see no matter what reviews say but as a person who did not like the original Lord Of The Rings trilogy I did like this one, I hope that helps in your decision. Overall, to me this was better then all three of the other movies. I give it a B+."
"KineticSeoul","8","1","4","7 January 2013"," Definitely a great start to the journey
","Doesn't have as much substance compared to ""Fellowship of the Ring"" but still a pretty solid movie. But ""Lord of the Rings"" has 3 separate novels that make up the trilogy and three separate movies. While ""The Hobbit"" is just one book so Peter Jackson probably tried to fit every detail of the book into this movie. And other written stuff by J. R. R. Tolkien. The movie starts off slow, in fact it takes quite a while before the journey takes off. But when it does kick off it becomes a entertaining adventure. But the build up is still good as well. It does a good enough job to make the viewers satisfied but crave more. Which is most definitely a positive when planning for a sequel as well. It's more action packed compared to ""Fellowship of the Ring"" though. And some action scenes seems far-fetched how things play out but it's still humorous at times. The cinematography is just crystal clear as well and adds to the fantasy style. Some complain about the faster frame rate but I personally liked it and looks more likes those fantasy drawings. Gandalf is just super cool in this movie, in fact he is one of the coolest old guy in a movie ever. You know the part where the crew tries to escape from Moria while battling orcs, goblins, trolls and Balrog. And it was cool but the escape scene from inside the Misty Mountains when the Dwarfs get taken captive and Gandalf shows up. This escape scene takes it to another level. And is the highlight of this movie. Peter Jackson also did a great job of picking the cast for this movie. Like he did for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. There is also quite a lot of CGI compared to ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy but since technology got more advanced it's just top notch. Overall this lacks substance compared to ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and a bit less intriguing and it's also slow moving. But it's a movie most definitely worth checking out in 3D.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"bhaveshbhatia","6","1","4","7 January 2013"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey spurns around the old philosophy of journey for truth and justice
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an adventure film with fantastic elements in it. If you liked the fantasy of Lord of the Rings, then you are surely going to love the fantastic elements of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The first part of Hobbit acts as a prequel to the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson has now walked back to cozy crevices of Middle Earth. Landscapes and scenery are majestically captured in celluloid by Andrew Lesnie, the cinematographer of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The story line reverberates around the same old quest and journey of finding out lost things of past. But the director has forgotten to pour in the hyperactive energy that his late eighties movies used to have. But still the game of the movie has not been presented so badly! Thirteen dwarfs, the hero Bilbo and Gandalf, the wizard march past Erebor to get back what they have lost. Smaug, the monster has robbed them of their rights and they are all set to reclaim their lost things. The battle scenes of the movie are long and tedious, without showing much detail of the battle. The whole battle will resemble the formatting of a video game and the audience, after watching the film for twenty minutes, will soon realize that they have to move on for another one and a half hour, tediously. <br/><br/>But The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has got an exciting story line may be because it is taken from J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit. The movie may turn out to be a bit irritating for people who did not like to watch The Lord of the Rings. The dwarfs are talking in English in Celtic accents and the elves who are played by actors of Australian origin speak in Standard English accents. The spooky and highly mountainous land, where the movie has been directed, becomes extremely horrifying as the movie advances. The dialogues of the movie have simplicity of folktale and the narrative technique is more or less straight, devoid of any kind of avant-garde narrative techniques. <br/><br/>Gandalf's statement to Bilbo, ""The world is not in your books and maps. It's out there!"" reminds us of the drudgery and pity of the post World War Britain. The above quoted statement reminds us of the fighter J.R. R. Tolkien who engaged himself with the First World War and knew that the real essence of life resides in fighting for your cause, a noble cause. The movie reverberates the romanticism of the philosophy of existentialism that tells us that a man has to go on fighting in order to establish himself in life. It is the journey and the struggle for life which is of utmost importance and not the achievement itself."
"FeatherlessBiped","5","2","13","23 December 2012"," Interesting but too much deviation & CGI
","The Lord of the Rings movies were so fantastic that I was willing to overlook a few invented scenes. The Hobbit strays much further from Tolkien's text; greatly overdramatizes many action scenes just because CGI enables it; and has too many corny-joke moments in what should be a sober tale.<br/><br/>Part of my rating is also because it's absurd to turn The Hobbit into three films. Two would have been pushing it. Naked greed is a black mark against this series.<br/><br/>It's a diverting film, but with all the alterations, it's just another fantasy spectacular. If it had really been The Hobbit (in fact and in spirit), I'd have rated it far higher."
"Johan-smedjebacka","7","2","13","22 December 2012"," Not so faithful to the book, but still good.
","So the day came that I have waited for in over a year, yes since the hobbit trailer came out. First things I must criticizes a bit is why did they add Frodo in the plot? When he hadn't nothing important there to do, just wasting of money. The beginning battle was a great scene, dwarfs in battle, we didn't see that in Lord Of The Rings, but the story of Azog went wrong in many parts of the movie. How the earth have Radagast the wizard such a big part in the movie? That wouldn't have been necessary,but after all he is a good man. Moral follows Tolkiens lines in some parts, specially when Gandalf speaks, for example the part when he tells Bilbo that it's in some situations best to spare enemies life. What takes most down my number to this movie is battles, which even in children's eyes look ridiculous, 14 warriors against thousands of orcs and nearly none are even hurt, this would have been better if they had kept the smaller battles from the book. Still this movie has so many beautiful scenes and good actors so it doesn't after all bring shame to Tolkien's name."
"Robert_duder","8","2","13","20 December 2012"," Jackson is back in full form like he was never gone. If you love LOTR you will love The Hobbit
","I remember seeing the first three Lord of The Rings films in the theatre and honestly finding them sort of boring and uninteresting. Maybe they just weren't my genre or I wasn't in the mood. Since I have rewatched them on video I have come to really appreciate and enjoy them. So I was looking forward to seeing Peter Jackson come back again. First of all I don't believe for a second that anyone could have made this happen in the same way other than Peter Jackson. I fear for the sequels if he doesn't helm them. No one knows middle earth like Peter Jackson. The film feels exactly like the original trilogy like you haven't been gone for a second. For that reason alone Jackson deserves accolades for giving his fans exactly what they expect. The cinematography and special effects are gorgeous, absolutely stunning. The CGI (which I am particularly critical of) is the very best of the best. There was only one scene out of dozens and dozens that I thought looked hokey. Whether or not the film needs to be three hours is much discussed and to a whole lot of pointless chatter because we all know Jackson does what Jackson wants. However, I did feel it dragged a lot and some of the more action packed scenes felt forced into the story.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is nothing short of brilliant as Bilbo Baggins. He gives a first class performance as the original adventuring Hobbit. He is so completely believable as the younger version of Ian Holm's older Bilbo. When I heard Ian Mckellen was returning to the Hobbit, I assumed it would be as a cameo or supporting character more along the lines of the original trilogy. Instead Mckellen returns as a major player, a main character. He is terrific and commands screen presence. He was born to play this role and proves it yet again. Richard Armitage is an excellent swashbuckling hero. He fills the void left by Viggo Mortensen very good though doesn't have quite the same charisma on screen. The rest of the dwarf adventurers are all great and you're certain to find your favorite but the problem is that it is such a huge group that no one dwarf gets the opportunity to stand out. They all sort of blend together and you often lose track of who is who. The various villains are all excellent, both the special effects that create them and the various voices behind them.<br/><br/>You wouldn't expect anything more from Peter Jackson than a sprawling ambitious epic and that is what he has done. Does it show a touch of ego? Absolutely. But for a man who created a billion dollar empire worth of movies and then comes back to do it all over again with the same recipe and the same feel and create legions of fans all over again. It certainly establishes itself firmly as the first part of a trilogy and unlike Fellowship of the Ring it actually felt like there was more closure at the ending but also a huge opening leaving you wanting to come back for more. The first half of the film left me wondering how much I was actually enjoying this, and the second half of the film (which I really think was superior) made me glad I was seeing this. Was it brilliant? Honestly, I don't know if I would say brilliant...I mean he has done this exact same thing before. But it was well done, entertaining and a worthy entry into the Lord of The Rings universe. Tolkien would still bow to Jackson. 8.5/10"

"geolot1256","7","2","13","16 December 2012"," a lifelong Tolkien fan's take
","I grew up on the Hobbit cartoon and the incomplete LOTR Ralph Bahkski cartoons and all the books Hobbit, LOTR, and Silmarillion being my favorite group of stories ever. I had to laugh at a prior review that made the claim that Tolkien ""ripped of J.K. Rowling"". This poster didn't realize that Tolkien had created his stories at least in part, before J.K. Rowling was even born. This lead me to believe that you should have to have read the books in order to review these movies. <br/><br/>These stories aren't like ""everything else out there"" as Tolkien pretty much invented the modern fairy tale. In fact, there are so many elements that Rowling took from Tolkien that you can't even claim that she ""ripped him off"" since Tolkien's themes are interwoven into fantasy culture that there is almost no way not to use themes in some way. For example: super villain's life-force tied to an inanimate object: Voldemort/Horecrux vs Sauron/ring.<br/><br/>In reviewing the Hobbit Part 1, the first thing I needed to do is come to peace with Jackson's decision to extend the story into 3 movies by interjecting a lot of back-story from the appendix materials from LOTR. I guess I have no choice but to accept that, so here we go:<br/><br/>PJ had brilliant source material to work with (I wish he would not have taken so many liberties with it) and did a great job with the visuals (WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS). The pacing does suffer from the interjection, but if you are invested in the story after all 3 movies you might appreciate the background information. Some of the added dialog written by Jackson & staff may not be appreciated (this will stand out like a sore thumb to Tolkien fans).<br/><br/>Others have told the story, so I will focus on what I believe are the mistakes: Starting in non-linear fashion with the time-line by featuring the older Bilbo and Frodo. This is an artificial way to get Ian Holm & Elijah Wood into this movie. Think if you showed the movies in the correct Middle Earth timeline (and not the timeline they were released) and it should flow linearly. <br/><br/>Too much time spent with the dwarfs in Bag-end and not enough accomplished. If spending all that time, why not have Thorin tell the story of Smaug/Erebor at the dinner table instead of older Bilbo in his book? Would have loved to hear the ""The Dwarfs of yore made mighty spells, while hammers fell like ringing bells, in places deep where dark things sleep.."" poem at that time.<br/><br/>The humor of the three trolls made that scene feel out of place (particularly them blowing their noses into the stew). Also not enough made of tricking the trolls to stay up until dawn. <br/><br/>Radagast: played ridiculously in the movie: scene trying to coax sick hedgehog back to life was way out of place and awkward. The rabbit- sleigh, the side of his face with bird droppings? Remember the wizards were spirits (maiar) who existed prior to the Arda (the world), not semi-drunk lunatics. I like the character in the FOTR book and feel he could have been integrated here if need be, but wish he was more dignified.<br/><br/>I didn't mind his foray into Dol Goldur, but the time-line was flawed. Greenwood turned to Mirkwood long before Thorin's company set out from Hobbiton. And how the heck did Radagast get over the Misty Mountains from Dol Goldur to near Rivendell? Radagast was the one who set Gandalf up with the eagles in FOTR book, so he should have used them as transport if he needed to cross the Misty Mountains instead of that asinine rabbit-sled. <br/><br/>Saruman: seemed old and feeble, disconnected, and obviously already corrupted.<br/><br/>The Great Goblin: He looked like a comical version ""Fat Bastard"" from Austin Powers with a non-goblin voice to match. <br/><br/>The worst cringe-worthy part for me was when Great Goblin asks Gandalf how is he going to kill him and Gandalf slashed him with his sword and Goblin says ""that'll do it"".<br/><br/>The escape from Goblin-town was a bit to overdone, especially the huge plunge down to the bottom of the chamber with the wise-crack from Dwalin. Also, mini goblin note-taker was ridiculous. PJ turned these Goblins into cartoon characters and they didn't feel like the breed of Orcs that I always imagined. <br/><br/>Azog was killed in the Battle of Anulzibar, so why did he survive in the movie version? He felt more like a re-hash of the Uruk-Hai, especially after Gandalf interrogated Thorin with ""who have you told about your quest? You are being tracked"". Also reminded me of Celeborn telling Aragorn the same in FOTR movie in relation to the Uruks. <br/><br/>Bilbo's meeting with Gollum didn't match the way it was filmed in FOTR prologue. <br/><br/>Gollum's ""Time"" riddle was cut short: ""slays king, ruins town, and beats high mountain down""<br/><br/>Scenes with the orcs in broad daylight and they were unaffected.. this is a huge mistake. <br/><br/>The tree/warg scene was too drawn-out and Bilbo's hero moment (facing off against Azog) was not very believable. <br/><br/>Dwarfs Fili & Kili way too human looking. <br/><br/>Other than those gripes, I really liked this movie (but wanted to LOVE it). <br/><br/>I actually am looking forward to seeing the appendix material fleshed- out in the next 2 films, but would like to see more restraint with the CGI and prefer the live orc costumes vs the George Lucas CGI stuff that makes movies look like some Pixar cartoon. I would also like to see some more editing where logical absurdities and other contradictions are corrected. And please, no more rabbit sleds !!!!"
"jose-cruz53","6","2","13","15 December 2012"," Quite competent but nothing special
","I found this little-long film to be quite entertaining. It is much weaker than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, given that its source material is also weaker. Tolkien began to craft his Middle Earth in the Hobbit novel but from the film I got the impression that the concept of the Middle Earth began as something quite less impressive than what it blossomed later in the Lord of the Rings. Here we have basically an children's adventure story set in a fantasy land full of orcs, goblins and monsters of all kinds.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the film entertaining but certainly not on the level of the original Lord of the Rings films. Competently executed but nothing that is a must see."
"richsnuggle","1","2","13","15 December 2012"," Boring.
","This movie is boring and it has a lot of liberality in regards to following the book. For instance the way to Rivendale is different. The manner in which the Dwarfs arrive is different as is their behavior. The way they enter the Goblin city is different and so is the death of the Goblin King. In fact it's actually a more developed version of the novel. I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing, but I do know one thing; this movie is boring. I'm not sure what else to say. The film is not that all interesting... the visuals were nice, there were some genuinely gruesome bits, the Gollum scene was well done, the elves were portrayed to be unhappy generally which is a large departure from the book, most of the Dwarfs did not seem like Dwarfs and some of the things they said (""Do they have any chips?"", (at dinner) is breaking the fourth-wall smiling. Props were nicely done, and most of the clothing was intricate and believable...<br/><br/>I dunno I'm somewhat divided on this movie. It wasn't great, it wasn't badly done, it wasn't... the hobbit."
"nobodysperfect06","6","2","13","15 December 2012"," Pity.
","A basic comparison of the opening film of the near-perfect Lord of the Rings trilogy and this opening film for The Hobbit films reveals the problem at the root of this unpolished movie: urgency. We begin Fellowship with a clear sense of what needs to be done: a ring must be destroyed. The first Hobbit shares this: the Lonely Mountain must be retaken. These are pretty meaningless motives for a non-Middle Earth audience to consume. What engages us is why these things must be done. Fellowship: to prevent evil from destroying all that is good in the world. The first Hobbit: to return some dwarfs who we barely care about to their vast wealth (which is justly theirs?). In short, in Fellowship, we cared; in the first Hobbit, we couldn't care less, despite our determination to love the film. There is nothing driving the story here, no urgency: we don't really care what happens and, I suspect, the writers didn't really either. This was not a great attempt to adapt a difficult book to cinema, it was a sell-out: Tolkien wrote it that way so let's just use that as our excuse if it doesn't work. Why put in the effort?<br/><br/>Is it fair for me to blame the writers? After all, Lord of the Rings is certainly far more conducive to cinema than The Hobbit and they were certainly true to the book. Regardless, there was a (pretty obvious) alternative way to frame this story and create an urgent, powerful story. In the mini Council of Elrond scene, we learn that a new dark power could be rising. One of the points that is briefly made is that, if this new power got hold of Smaug, they could be invincible. All that is good in Middle Earth could be gone. It would, perhaps, be impossible for Frodo to destroy the ring 60 years later. This framing narrative (with a bit of artistic licence) could have transformed this film. In the prologue, Gandalf could have heard about this new power, he could have learned of its interest in Smaug, he could have found the dwarfs, rallied them up with some patriotic rhetoric about getting them to reclaim their homeland (hiding the fact that he was concerned with the possible fate of middle earth) and then we could have got round to Bilbo. By doing this, the audience would care, there would be a point to the story: potentially saving middle earth or at least making sure Frodo would have one less great obstacle in his way. Not only this, there would be a framing device that would structure the whole film: it would be unified, instead of messy; purposeful, instead of hesitant. A much better film could have been made.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that this film is still worth viewing. All of the elements of the film are superb and the riddle game with Gollum revived my faith in Peter Jackson's story-telling abilities, albeit briefly. This is one of those films that simply needed a day or two more thinking at the script stage and a bit of Rings-style confidence. Unfortunately, effects and 48fps seem to have been of more interest and the writers were too afraid to take Tolkien off his mythical pedestal. Structuring the story is 90 percent of the job in cinema: get that right and it's hard to go wrong. Unfortunately, they didn't and it went wrong."

","The trailer was interesting but since I had $18 dollars invested I stayed for the Hobbit. I hadn't seen the other Lord of the Rings movies and had heard they were good so I was excited to finally see what I had missed. I special effects were astounding. Every detail was present. You really felt like you were watching live footage of ancient caves,trails, and village life of dwarfs,trolls,elves and such. The filming was like I was in a helicopter watching. At times I became dizzy. The storyline was not captivating but the visual experience was breath taking. Again, like a amusement park ride. I would recommend it. I would have deleted scenes with the horse thieves,the food orgy, and the rock monsters. They added nothing and made the movie drag on for the sake of I don't know what."

","I read the Hobbit many times as a boy and I honestly wanted this to be a good film. There were a lot of special effects that were pretty good. The shire village was constructed pretty well, the orcs all looked fierce and the wargs were scary. But I was disappointed with the way the story was changed. He had Thorin Oakenshield being a hater of Elves! This just was not true and it is far too much poetic license. And then the movie was prolonged another 45 minutes by putting in a new quarrel between Thorin and the pale skinned Orc. The movie was too drawn out, it should have come to the point quicker. The Hobbit is already a good story and it is not necessary to add or subtract from it. 100 years from now people will still be reading the hobbit but I doubt they will be seeing this movie."

To be honest I was a bit disappointed about the 3-D effect, I can't understand why no director can create a 3-D movie as good as Avatar? Mr. Cameron has set the standards too high I guess.<br/><br/>So how about the story? I gave it a 6 out of 10 (10 is for the Return of The King), Mr. Jackson somehow altered the story on how Gollum lost the Ring to Bilbo and Mr. Jackson tried to cover too many details in 160 minutes, it's a bit difficult for a fan like me to digest, not to mention others new audiences who are new to the franchise. The brown wizard on the rabbit sledge is very stupid. Too much animation is the major drawback.<br/><br/>Do I like the Lord of The Ring story? Of course I love it!

"t-viktor212","9","1","5","28 December 2015"," An unexpected journey: extended edition
","In this review I'll consider the extended edition of the film. The hobbit, in my opinion, is an example of a book-based movie that has been expanded and modified respect the book in a positive way. Various things differ from the original ""The hobbit"" novel, many of the things shown in the movie are only mentioned in either the hobbit or the fellowship of the ring, some other stuff was added without appearing at all in the Tolkien books. Other than cowing cash, this is why a such short novel's movie adaptation required a division in three movies: the story got expanded so much that the amount of events couldn't fit in a single movie but required further divisions. Also said expansions made a bigger bondage of the hobbit trilogy to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as it would've had otherwise. The Hobbit: an unexpexcted journey is greatly entertaining, even if it is 3 hours long. Homever, understanding the importance of certain scenes might require a view of either at least ""the fellowship of the ring"" or the entire LOTR trilogy. There's nothing I can criticize, not even the extensive use of CGI, because it just worked well (better than in 'The Two Towers'), the well-done acting of the actors, or the music. Everything just worked well together, and made the movie really entertaining despite the lenght of it. The only problem with ""an unexpected journey"" is the lenght that doesn't allow to watch the movie that often."
"alindsay-al","8","1","5","18 October 2015"," A great film worthy of the middle earth name.
","I rewatched this film last night and since I didn't really do a proper review for it before I thought I would now. The premise of this film sees hobbit Bilbo baggins thrust into an adventure on a question with a wizard and 12 dwarfs to reclaim there homeland from a dragon. Martin freeman as young Bilbo was a perfect choice, he totally encapsulated everything I imagined him to be. He was funny and likable and you really wanted to root for him on his adventure. Ian mckellen returns to his iconic role of gandalf the grey and well he is fantastic in this film. He is gandalf and always will be he totally encapsulates the wise older wizard who we all want to listen too. Richard arimtage plays thorin oakenshield who is the leader of the dwarfs and he was really good in this film. Yes he was a bit grumpy and stubborn sometimes but you see the pain in his character and you understand why he must complete this task. I also really like how his and Bilbo's relationship develops as the film goes on. However, one of my biggest negatives was the rest of the group of dwarfs. Even in a 2 and a half hour movie we don't really get any development for them and it actually makes me not really care about them too much. The story had a really good vibe about it, I love some of the character development and some great cameos that actually made sense. However, this film does have the problem that it really does lack in payoff. The ending was pretty lacklustre which is probably down to them having to make it three movies. The script was great with allot of well placed humour but some great drama that really stressed the situation. The style if this film is breathtaking with the look of the film being beautiful and all the action scenes really delivering. Overall this is a great movie that if your a middle earth fan you must see."

The 3 hours or so felt like only an hour and it left an addictive taste for more. It could not have had a better cast than Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage. I cannot wait to watch The Desolation of Smaug!"

","I love this movie, it's really awesome. I know it has slow build up, but i liked it. Because i'm a huge fan of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, all 3 are on my top 10 list, and Return of the King is my favorite movie. And now my second favorite movie is An Unexpected Journey. It had great action scenes, there is a lot of CGI, that bothered me a little, but it didn't took me out of the movie. And they are some changes from the book, but i thought they were great. Especially Azog. The riddles in the dark segment was really AWESOME, i could have watched that for 3 hours and i would be completely entertained. And after it ends, i would probably play it again. The relationship between Bilbo and the Dwarfs was really good, especially the relationship with Thorin. At first Thorin doesn't like Frodo, because his small and can't fight, but while the movie is going their relationship is becoming better, Thorin starts to appreciate Bilbo more. Bilbo even saves Thorin's life at the end of the movie. The end was really great, after Bilbo saves Thorin's life, the eagles come, and they fly them to some rock, and Thorin wakes up. And his all like: What are you doing here. I told you, this is not place for you. Something like that. And then he says: ""I have never been so wrong in whole my life"". Then they look to the Lonely mountain, and movie ends."

","As a dedicated fan of the Lord of the Rings series and all of Tolkien's work put into it, this was ultimately a must see film for myself. While I did anticipate changes for The Hobbit in comparison to the rest of the Lord of the Rings franchise, I was left with questionable thoughts about it. Because the Lord of the Rings franchise ended in 2003 after making The Return of the King, The Hobbit (made nine years later) was likely to be missing a portion of the necessary and original Lord of the Rings feelings. In some cases The Hobbit felt a bit more merry than the Lord of the Rings movies and I couldn't help but continuously relate The Hobbit back to the original Lord of the Rings series. While The Hobbit is more of an adventurous story, and the dwarfs are very spirited characters, I still believe The Hobbit had an empty feeling in relation with the rest of the franchise. After watching the movie a third time, I found myself settling back into the Lord of the Rings state of mind and came to understand that while it may never be the same, it is nevertheless my favorite story by Tolkien and captures key moments making it an overall wholehearted movie and a good time for any fans of Peter Jackson, J.R.R. Tolkien, and or the Lord of the Rings in general. I suggest forgetting the Lord of the Rings movies all together when going to see this and keeping an open mind. After all there is a nine year difference. Looking forward to the next two movies in this great Hobbit adventure. Overall 8.7 rating. <br/><br/>-Collin Rook"

","Having watched the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy and being a massive fan, I expected huge things from The Hobbit and needless to say, it provided. The story was delivered well, with the cut-away stories that won't be found in the book (but are however hinted at) proving exciting and intriguing as it links up the two Trilogies. <br/><br/>The overall look of the film is different from The Lord of the Rings, it is a lot more animation heavy and at points light-hearted. Many feel that this is a flaw with the the film and while I can reason with that. I, however, am indifferent. After reading the novel I understood that it was aimed more towards children and was meant to be more 'kid-friendly'. So on that front, the film succeeds, it delivers the film with that warm glow without overdoing it. On the other hand, a large proportion of the audience will be people who are expecting another Lord of the Rings, darker and more 'real'. So in other words, this is The Hobbit, not the Lord of the Rings and while the two are part of the same universe, they are different stories and must be treated so. <br/><br/>The film does an excellent job at showcasing it's characters and revealing who they are, with the exception of the dwarfs. With there being such a large number of dwarfs (13) it would be impossible to establish characters for each one, however they do try. They stick to a few important dwarfs which I feel was a smart move by Peter Jackson, the director, allowing the audience not to feel overwhelmed with the amount of information being thrown at them. Then of course, Bilbo Baggins, our main character as played by Martin Freeman who does an excellent job. Through Bilbo we see that stubbornness, and fright at anything that he isn't familiar with, eventually giving in to his curiosity and following the dwarfs on their quest. The main attribute that stands out in Bilbo is his bravery which. At first he is keen to shake the idea that he is of no use to the dwarfs and ultimately makes things worse but as the story reaches it's end we see Bilbo eventually earn the respect of his companions, something the audience feel is deserved by this point. <br/><br/>The story is resented well in a fun and exciting manor that, while containing some silly and bizarre elements is strong and holds the attention of it's watchers. From the moment of it's beginning, to it's end, the films tempo changes little. From the refreshing beginning which depicts the events just before the Fellowship of the Ring to the end which makes us determined to explore the next part of the company's journey we rarely lose interest. It keeps very true to the original book which was only what was expected of it in fairness but my main concern is Radagast the Brown. This eccentric wizard is acted well so there is no complaint there but it's more how out of place he seems. It feels as though he was thrown in because he had to be, and then his ridiculous rabbit sledge is pushing the boundaries of silly.<br/><br/>In general, this film was a fantastic watch, which falls short only on a few occasions. For a fan of Middle-Earth this won't disappoint, for a fan of the Lord of the Rings it shouldn't disappoint and for a fan of good film this certainly will not disappoint."

","It amazes me how the generations get so Jaded. The BIG debates over this film are whether it's too much of a kid's movie and if the the CG is overwrought. The movie is full of be-headings and the breakout star is a bipolar cave dwelling cannibal. J.R.R. Tolkien created a truly Grimm fairy tale and Peter Jackson has honored it. I watched the feature length animated movie as a kid and this is without question a Masterpiece of evolution. In the theatre I laughed out loud and loved every minute of it. Now on my 5th viewing I am amazed at the sophisticated writing, telling a tale so timely with real lessons in morality, faith and honor. Occasionally we get a perfect blend of all things that make great filmmaking and this one joins that coveted list."
"sascha-17","7","1","5","22 April 2013"," Square peg meets round hole
","Let me start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised when I finally watched The Hobbit on DVD last week. Having read a ton of reviews and rants online and shaking my head in disbelief at the weird decision to turn a 320-page children's-book into three 180-minute movies, I really wanted to hate this flick.<br/><br/>Turns out it's not that bad after all, but that may have something to do with the fact that I'm a huge sucker for everything Tolkien. Consequently, I didn't mind the slow start of the film. In fact, the prologue (narrated by the wonderful Ian Holm) does a good job of getting you re-acquainted with the world of Middle Earth and giving you the necessary background on the history of Durin's Folk (Dwarfs). I also didn't mind the extended party sequence at Bag End.. those scene are pretty much straight out of the book.<br/><br/>But let me get straight to my two main criticisms: Tone and unnecessary changes.<br/><br/>The filmmakers are pretty obviously trying to make The Hobbit fit in with LOTR, and that's like trying to fit the proverbial square peg into a round hole. One is a lighthearted fairytale written for kids, the other is a hugely complex and much darker epic. But instead of settling for one tone (lighthearted or serious/epic) and sticking with it, the filmmakers try to have it both ways. And they actually make things worse by not just incorporating the more childish stuff from the novel, but by adding in *more* childish stuff that wasn't even in the book. Belching Dwarfs, a Troll-snot-covered Bilbo or a guano-loving wizard driving a bunny-sleigh are nowhere to be found in Tolkien writings. Perhaps most importantly, the film can't seem to hold its tone for more than ten minutes.<br/><br/>There would be nothing wrong with a lighthearted tone in the first half hour and a subsequent shift towards darker material. Which is what the book does: Opening with a comedic sequence in Bag End and moving to scarier scenes like the spider-sequence, Smaug destroying Lake-town or the Battle of the Five Armies. Instead we're constantly shifting between serious and silly. Like in the Radagst scene which starts out like a piece from a Disney-movie and then turns into a pretty intense affair depicting the terrors of Dol Guldur.<br/><br/>At the same time, the writers are desperately looking for conflict where there was none in the source material. Thorin's attitude towards the Elves wasn't exactly friendly in the book, but here he is borderline hostile towards them. And I don't think I'm misreading a single scene here, since he fiercely objects to going to Rivendell, he doesn't want Elrond to view the map (for some reason) and he has to sneak off during the completely superfluous White Council meeting. None of which happened in the book. The Dwarfs didn't get along well with the Elves, but they weren't openly hostile. And neither did the Elves nor anyone else at this point try to stop the company from continuing the quest. It's a bit like the changes done to Faramir in the LOTR-films: Just like him, Rivendell/Elrond become an obstacle for the heroes instead of just an episode in the story.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that the whole hostility-deal does come in later in the narrative of the book as well, but for a much better reason than the one presented in the film. Basically, the writers took this whole element from a later point in the story (the company's imprisonment by Thranduil) and shifted it to an earlier point to give their film a bit more conflict. The problem is that it just doesn't ring true and it makes the Dwarfs look like aggressive imbeciles.<br/><br/>Then there's the White Council: While it is great to see these characters together on screen, the whole sequence was rather pointless. Here are four people talking about stuff foreshadowing the events in LOTR, but none of it has anything to do with Bilbo's/Thorin's story. You could easily leave the whole thing out (and put it into an extended cut) and the movie wouldn't suffer at all. Plus: Let's not forget that the information we get about the Witch King contradicts what Tolkien wrote. Check out the LOTR-wiki for more info on this breach of canon.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: I do understand why the writers made these changes. They're obviously trying to give the first 100 pages of the book (because that's what this film covers) the structure of a stand-alone film. But the result isn't exactly successful: We get some stapled on character-development like Thorin's ""boy, was I wrong about you""-scene, we get some exaggerated Elves vs. Dwarfs-conflict and we get a main antagonist in the form of Azog where there was none in the book. We also get scenes fleshing out the world of Middle Earth more - which Tolkien-fans will probably love. But if we're honest these are nothing more than glorified filler and stuff meant to link this trilogy to the original one.<br/><br/>All that said, it is rather surprising that I liked the movie as much as I did. It's no ""Fellowship"" (my personal favourite of the LOTR-films), but it certainly isn't ""Phantom Menace""-material, either. Yes, there is a ton of CGI in here which sometimes doesn't *really* work, but overall the world of Middle Earth (according to Jackson) looks as breathtaking as ever. The acting is mostly very good. I especially liked Martin Freeman as Bilbo, who did a much, much better job than Elijah Wood in the original trilogy. He was so good in fact, that I couldn't help but wonder how LOTR would've turned out had he played Frodo.<br/><br/>Bottom line: A must-see if you're a (tolerant) Tolkien-fan who can live with all the changes. But if you're not into Tolkien or even fantasy in general, this probably won't be your cup of tea.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Sat at the cinema with no intervals (the movie started late) my bum was extremely numb by the end, but who cares because this film was well worth it. After reading then watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy I was slightly disappointed about the amount of stuff that had to be cut out to fit in 3 films. I am extremely glad that this will not be the case with The Hobbit. Some might believe there is not enough action and adventure involved but avid Tolkien fans will be more than pleased with the attention to detail this film provides. Although there are parts that are slightly altered (as with most every book-film) the majority of it is as if the words have jumped out of page and onto screen. The casting was great, Freeman played a convincing Bilbo, of course Sir Ian McKellen was excellent and I am a small fan of Richard Armitage and James Nesbitt and felt they were a healthy addition. The acting was very good as expected and the performance of the songs was perfect (especially Thorin's song).<br/><br/>I eagerly await the second part of the film based on an incredible piece of literature."

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a three hour 12a/PG-13 Rated Movie based on Part 1 of the classic novel. I had never seen a Lord of The Rings movie before, so I went in very much with an open mind. The fact the book was 300 pages and is split into THREE PARTS, was just an opportunity to drag a film out. And did it? Oh Yes, yes it did. The thing that annoyed me was that, there isn't much progression between the start and the end of the film and the so called journey doesn't begin until a good HOUR into the film. This film was so hyped up and it failed to live up to its name, but there are some good bits. Bilbo and Gandolph were casted perfectly and Peter Jackson's special effects never disappoint.It also had some cool battle scenes which I loved. I don't want to give anything away so I'll leave it there. Go in with an open mind and if your a Lord of the Rings fan just accept it for what it is."

","I finally saw the movie yesterday in 3D. I do not know if it was the constant service calls for soda refills in the theatre or the itchiness of the 3D glasses, I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought. It was an unexpected journey to the theatre for me. That said, the movie had some breathtaking imagery, and camera plunging to the abyss scenes reminiscent of the LOTR.<br/><br/>Someone told me prior the the movie's start, that the actual book is lesser in pages and simpler than the LOTR. But truly I could have figured that on my own, even if he hadn't said so. Because;<br/><br/>1.Writing: The writing feels stretched. The mission for the covenant is made clear from the very start in the movie, yet the mission fades away because there is a lot of side details ( in many cases justifying and elaborating the LOTR). It feels like the writer is trying hard to derive from the LOTR memoir, the strength to embolden the script, but instead he looses the focus. Eg. What was the point of Radgast? The Trolls, the Spiders and the Hare sledge race, Sauramon appearing dismissive etc. Just seems like they were stretching the whole plot, and trying to fill in the time to make it a three part movie.<br/><br/>2. Poor Character development: One could relate to the emotional Canvass of LOTR (the fear, trials, friendship and deceit of the characters). Here one just fails to empathize with the characters as almost nothing is known about their inspirations and motives lest alone their names. The older Bilbo Baggins seems cynical and prude ( without much stuttering in his words, eyes and hands). The younger Bilbo Baggins, seems funny, restless and a different guy altogether. I still wonder what made him leave the shire anyway. What gave him the strength to face the orcs and the trolls, when he hadn't ever stepped out of his shire before in his life. Some of the Dwarfs who were fighter, seemed more scared than he was.<br/><br/>3.Dragon: Having overcome the different arduous things, summoning up courage and risking life on their way just to face off a dragon to get the gold and mountain, Well, (meh!) doesn't appeal to me. Or perhaps, the grand scheme of what is at stake (or coming like in LOTR) is not laid out well in the movie. The last I heard was that Shrek tamed a dragon. I don't know what and why are the 14 Middle earth heroes doing the same. For gold and mountain? Nah! that is not solid.<br/><br/>LOTR soundtrack, cinematography, New Zealand, costume, Rivendell little bit of Frodo and the mines - These were the real treat."
"patrokov","7","1","5","9 January 2013"," More for Tolkien Aficianados than the average LOTR movie fans
","Nothing in this review is a spoiler if you have already seen the Lord of Rings (LOTR) trilogy (or read the book)!!! The Hobbit was a pretty short, children's book describing how a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, went on an adventure with Gandalf and a group of dwarfs to reclaim their mountain from a dragon. The book just happens to include Bilbo finding a magic ring that makes the wearer invisible.<br/><br/>When Tolkien later wrote LOTR, he decided that the ring from The Hobbit would become the ring of Sauron. He also decided to place all of the random, throwaway events from The Hobbit into a larger history of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT an adaptation of the book, The Hobbit. It is an adaptation of the history of that Tolkien later constructed. This is great news for people that love Tolkien and have read the appendices of LOTR. Unfortunately, it waters down the story of The Hobbit and Bilbo's adventures and makes the movie(s) overlong, overcomplicated, and drag in parts. I can't help but think it would have been a much tighter, more understandable story. My relatives who are not Tolkienistas were lost during much of the movie, as it inter-cuts Bilbo's adventure with the events of the larger history.<br/><br/>Once the DVDs come out, I hope a ""Bilbo only"" cut is released (or done by a fan, like the no Jar Jar version of Phantom Menace).<br/><br/>The movie is an odd mix of tones. The book was a children's book and much lighter than LOTR in tone. Parts of the movie are very light and even dangerous moments are often played for laughs. The caves are very bright and, contrary to the LOTR, some of the orcs almost have a cartoon/animated style. Meanwhile other parts of the movie are played very seriously.<br/><br/>Gollum, of course, steals every scene he's in and looks even better than in the LOTR movies.<br/><br/>Of course everyone who has seen the trailer knows the dwarfs' song. The movie is faithful in that regard to the books including the poems and songs.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The movie is great, and, of course I can't wait to see the next ones, and one day the ""Bilbo cut"". So maybe Peter Jackson isn't crazy after all. But it could have been better."
"josarah_thevaliant","7","1","5","7 January 2013"," A Long Expected Movie
","Tolkien fans will know the story well. Many years before Frodo travels to Mordor in Lord of the Rings, Bilbo Baggins embarks on an adventure of his own. Hired as a ""burglar"" by a company of dwarfs, Bilbo travels through the Misty Mountains to reclaim the dwarfs' long lost home, and all its treasures, from the fearsome dragon Smaug. An Unexpected Journey tells of the beginning of their adventure.<br/><br/>As the first of its kind to be filmed in 48 frames per second, rather than the usual 24, it gives the movie a different cinematic feel that of its Lord of the Rings counterpart. Reportedly, this gives the 3D audience a greatly improved viewing. However, the increased detail creates a somewhat dizzying viewing in 2D, especially in the trademark, long-sweeping scenery shots.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has once again caught the essence of Tolkien's work. Amongst the dangers that always follow adventure, there are also lighthearted moments to cheer you along. With many a merry song and the riddles in the dark, the movie keeps true to the heart of the book.<br/><br/>However, in spanning the story across three long movies, Jackson has also expanded on minor story-lines, even going so far as to add more. While An Unexpected Journey will most certainly delight Tolkien fans, it does not stand strongly as a movie on its own. It raises questions as to whether The Hobbit should have stayed as one, single (yet epic!) movie, and if it will keep its momentum over three lengthy years. Looking forward to the next instalments, one can only hope that the worst is behind us."

That surprises me with a movie with this kind of budget, but maybe 3D isn't really a sufficiently mature technology for prime time just yet.<br/><br/>Other than that, I would have given it 10/10.

"Rob_Taylor","8","1","5","6 January 2013"," A good movie with a bit of a mixed bag of good and bad things.
","The Hobbit is actually quite hard to review. With the hype (and outrage) surrounding the 48fps HFR filming, it was always going to polarise opinions. For my viewing, I chose the trusted 24fps 2D viewing, and my review reflects this version alone.<br/><br/>On the whole, the Hobbit is a well-made epic that is worthy of praise. I do have some gripes about it, but they are relatively minor ones.<br/><br/>The major one is this: Although the book was written for children it seemed as if Jackson couldn't decided quite how to pitch the movie and to what audience. There are elements of buffoonery the like of which you will not see outside of the Three Stooges at times, whilst at other moments, the movie veers firmly back to a more Lord of the Rings mood, complete with seriousness and much glowering from the actors involved.<br/><br/>It's almost as if it is trying to be all things to all viewers, but is firmly unaware that, whilst catering to one section of the perceived audience, it is unintentionally irritating the rest.<br/><br/>The dwarfs start out as dour and somewhat comedic characters in the opening scenes, but they do grow on you. That said, some of them are little more than cardboard cutouts, given an amusing hairstyle to make them stand out from the others. With thirteen of them, this is only to be expected, even in a movie as long as the Hobbit is. Character development may come in the later films, but as far as Ori, Dori, Nori Oin and Gloin are concerned, I couldn't pick them out in a line up.<br/><br/>Another minor annoyance was the presence of Sylvester McCoy as Radagast. To be fair, he gives a reasonable performance, but the character is so ridiculous as to be innately unlikeable. As for the sled pulled by rabbits... well, let's just say that was a mistake and leave it at that.<br/><br/>However, other than these things I did, in fact, quite enjoy the movie. There were a number of moments where scenes really did drag on too long and where I found myself hoping things would move on soon. Given that this is the theatrical release, I expect we will see an extended DVD/Bluray release at some point with some scenes extended even further.<br/><br/>For contrast, after watching this, I watched the original Rankin Bass cartoon version from the 70's. That tells the whole story of the book in 1hr and 17 mins., with the material contained within Jackson's version finishing at about the thirty minute mark. It gets all the important information out in that time, too.<br/><br/>There has been some concern that Jackson (and the studios) are milking this tale somewhat and I do share those concerns. I think two movies would have been quite enough to tell the tale, not three. I expect the second part of the trilogy will spend an eternity in Mirkwood, with a lot of action centered around Dol Guldur, before finishing up at Esgaroth. The final movie I expect will be almost non-stop action, God-help us! All in all, however, a very watchable movie. I would have preferred less clownishness and more glowering, however, but that is just me.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: A little confused as to who it is targeting, audience-wise. Slow to start, but doesn't let up once it gets going. A little overlong, in my opinion."

","First off, I'm a big fan of the LOTR series and had high expectations for the prequel. <br/><br/>The Good: The intro is done differently than the book, and is better . <br/><br/>Flashbacks concisely tell back stories in a way that is engaging, intriguing, and overall mesmerizing. <br/><br/>(SLIGHT SPOILER) The section from when they introduce Radagast to when they venture out of Rivendell not only is the tightest cut section, but also uniquely sets ""The Hobbit"" in motion for the next 2 movies as well as connects back to the story of LOTR.<br/><br/>The Bad: After the title, the 10 minute section that drills in that this is a sequel to LOTR is unnecessary and boring! The details later take care of this, and would cut down the much complained about run time. <br/><br/>The makers focused more on staying true to the book rather than adapting it for the screen. Showing instead of telling, combining plot points, and pacing all feel and look more like a visual rendering of the book instead of what could have been one of the best adaptations of all time. <br/><br/>The LOTR has my favorite orchestral soundtrack to any movie. Each have the same themes, but have new additions for each one and different performances. The Hobbit relied too heavily on rehashed versions of the ""Song of the Lonely Mountain"" and these themes instead of presenting something new. <br/><br/>Conclusion: A satisfying movie for fan boys and fantasy fanatics, but not a cinematic gem.

","There were some real positive aspects about the hobbit, BUT nothing we have not already seen before. You can't go into this movie with a lot of high expectations, and it is impossible to discuss this film without pointing out scenes that are full of spoilers.<br/><br/>For the most part, if you have seen Lord of the Rings, you will feel comfortable with this prequel. There is so much familiarity that middle earth should live like someplace you can drive in a couple hours time. Music is carried over with very few new themes; the set and locations have all been recreated meticulously; the original frodo and bilbo open the movie and it just feels like a continuation of the end of Return of the King. There is a lot more primary CGI/Action Capture in this, which again sits in a comfort zone in its self. Lighting, filters, camera, action.... it just seems like more of the same.<br/><br/>It is a slower moving movie, and at 48fps in 2D didn't really make that much of a difference. Jackson added new material which I found annoying, and many of the action sequences seemed plagiarized from the preceding trilogy. For example, the rocky path through the stone giants can't be broken free from the pass of Caradhras, and I'm sorry it was just a bit overplayed. Jackson focuses his attention on a small selection of sequences that are in the book but sometimes not all that important, however the goblin king, trolls (yet a little over the top) and riddles in the dark work out very well.<br/><br/>For all involved, this movie could have been extremely short and still hold true to the book. The curse of making it three movies is that no one really wants to wait 2 years to see this culminated or to see 8 plus hours of fill for a 280 page book (the Lord of The Rings was 1137 in its entirety). I curse you, Peter Jackson, because I too will be seeing what you do with the rest of your treatment of this story just like many other followers, but don't expect me to like it."

","Let me start by saying what a huge fan I am of LOTR, so of course was so excited that the hobbit was being made! Unfortunately, I watched it in IMAX 3D and was very very disappointed, especially after watching the trailer which looked so good!! It was like watching a cheap cartoon and felt so false - not like the LOTR trilogy, which was just epic. The hobbit was also slow and stretched at times. I really hope the other 2 films are not as stretched as this one, otherwise I'll be waiting to watch them on DVD. The acting was excellent though and the funny one liners were brilliant. I'm sure I would have loved the film if it wasn't in 3D and shot in HD / extra frames per second! Shame it wasn't done the same way as the LOTR trilogy."

","The book was as I remember it (read it many years ago), truly fantastic, vivid and something very different from what I had read at that time. The language and finesse, the scenery and places it describes, the characters and creature (good or bad), it was all one big adventure.<br/><br/>Well lets take the film then, is it too much to divide it into three films, yes I guess at the moment I think so, but are the two next films going to be as good, well I certainly hope so. there is no way you can't find this film beautiful, extraordinary and something truly adventures and magic. I was very entertained and loved it all the way, this is just a film you have to see, something that will awaken your inner child and keep you wishing it wasn't over so soon (or you had to wait a year for the next). It is very rich in detail and story telling and this is why it spans three movies I guess, but when these are over we might want to have The Lord of the Rings Trilogy in a new and longer version :) I don't know... but the Universe of Middle Earth is a very interesting place and spending time there in this movie is a bliss.<br/><br/>I don't know why some people and critics are not loving this film, yes you have to compare it to the earlier films (Lord of the rings trilogy), but is all depending on those, if we have not had the earlier film would they think differently about this one, I think so..."
"ketgup83","9","1","6","22 June 2013"," Jaw- dropping !!!
","Adapting a classic tale and turning into a big-budget visual effects driven fantasy is not everybody's cup of tea. Peter Jackson , the captain of the ship, had kept the momentum and astonished everyone with yet another knock-out film.<br/><br/>The Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit who is provoked to join the company of spirited dwarfs to reach the Lonely Mountain to re-claim their kingdom which is guarded by ferocious dragon called Smaug.<br/><br/>Before writing ahead about this movie , I must confess that I have not watched The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy so it kind of gave me advantage to start from the beginning. Based on book of same name by J.R.Tolkeins, The Hobbit is enchanting , stupendous and grasping. Right from the beginning , the movie touches your heart with standardized cinematography and jaw-dropping art direction. The story catches on to you slowly and there are couple of flashback , each with its own unique tale to tell. It is difficult to point out any particular scene which is impressive but the best scene was the combat between thunderous rocks. The direction is amazing and hats off to Peter Jackson for handling such a difficult story and making it so likable. Screenplay is top-notch. Editing is tight. Dialogues are punching. Entire star cast has given a commendable performance but it is my favourite character Gollum ( voiced by Andy Serkis) who steals the show within short span of time. <br/><br/>Watch Hobbit for it immensely likable characters , gorgeous location , enthralling CGI and powerful story which eventually will unfold to new characters in the next series."

","A lot of people were skeptically when it was announced that Peter Jackson was taking JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit and turning it into a trilogy. Why take the shortest book out of the four book series and turn it into three movies is beyond me, but the first installment in the Hobbit trilogy is perhaps my second favorite out of the Jackson film adaptations, right behind The Fellowship of the Rings, which takes home the grand prize for it's upbeat nature and wholesome Middle Earthiness. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey received a mixed reception when it got released, some saying it was an entertaining blockbuster in the heart of good adventure stories, some saying it was as bad as Battlefield Earth. But I think it's good popcorn and nacho fun and if you want to kill a Saturday afternoon by watching a movie, then this might be your flick. I'm a big fan of LOTR films with good humor, action, character development and wonder (which is one of the many reasons why I hold Bakshi's LOTR at such high regards), so I thought this film was grand for what it was. After all, we have not seen a motion picture that takes place in Middle Earth for nearly ten years. <br/><br/>Some complained about the special effects and Jackson's controversial use of 48 fps, but this didn't bother me all that much while watching the film. I will say that the film has scenes of fast pace and scenes that leave you out of breath, but this factor is meant to intensify the whole movie experience. It is there to make you feel like you are right there with the characters and experiencing the adventures they are hurled into and although some things seem a bit out of place, the film does have a nice look to it and a great atmosphere to be engulfed in. I love the look of the Shire, for it has such a woodsy, fragrant and greenery appeal to it and makes me want to live there, eating vegetables and smoking the ""finest weed in the Southfarthing"" with the Hobbits. The look of Rivendell (the land of the elves) is also lovely to behold and something reminiscent of a ancient fairy tale land or a land straight out of a classic Disney film.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the characters. Martin Freeman may not look exactly like Sir Ian Holm, but he has Bilbo Baggins' distinct personality and characteristics down to a tee. When he runs about the Shire shouting ""I'm going on an adventure!"", it sums up his outlook and trademarks flawlessly and reminds us of the timid, yet optimistic Bilbo in Tolkien's original novel. He also delivers funny lines during the troll scene, which is arguably the most hilarious sequence in all Lord of the Rings. Sir Ian McKellen pulls off Gandalf the Grey flawlessly, even if he hasn't played that version of Gandalf in almost 12 years. When the other characters are in turmoil, he always knows when to show up and work wonders with his wooden stick of might. All 13 of the dwarfs are reminiscent of the dwarfs in Disney's Snow White and know just how much butt to kick when vicious abominations and creatures show up to start trouble. They are liable to get a few chuckles out of the audience, for like Bilbo, they have quirky dialogue and perfectly timed one liners. <br/><br/>The other actors are also exemplary in their respected roles. Christopher Lee can still pull of Saruman at an impressive 90 years old and Hugo Weaving is still a triumphant Elrond with a deep, kingly voice. Perhaps the funniest characters out of the entire film are the corpulent Goblin King, the three hungry trolls who steal the gang's horses and the Gollum, who is admittedly a cutey pie this time around and not the scheming twerp he was in TTT and ROTK. When he and Bilbo play the game of riddles for the ring, he stares up at Bilbo with the eyes of a dog and the excitement of a three year old who just found out he is going to Toys R Us. I felt a little sorry for him when he found out that Bilbo stoled the ring and he went absolutely nuts as if he just lost a fortune on a failed Italian restaurant. Poor little dude. All he wanted was his ""preccccioussss"". I have to give credit to Andy Serkis, for he is able to make the Gollum realistic and lifelike with his spidery and agile movements. The animators also did a brilliant job and were able to capture Serkis' movements and animate overtop of them perfectly. Sometimes, it's as if he isn't even computer generated at all. That's how realistic and incredible the effects are.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey is far from being a boring film. This funfest has action at every turn and will keep you captivated until the end credits. One minute, the characters are put up against deadly wargs, the next minute, they are in the midst of a deadly rock giant fight. In one scene, they are picked up by giant birds. No fooling! I think some were expecting to see the films of the original trilogy all over again, right down to the gritty war battles with a choir shouting songs in elvish. But remember, this film is entering a different territory than the territory explored beforehand. You just got to except it for what it is and enjoy the fun despite the obvious goofs and mishaps. I certainly enjoyed this film, for it was stuffed with the very things we look forward to seeing in movies, exhilaration and excitement, stuff to get the adrenaline flowing. Hopefully the sequels can carry on in these shoes as we encounter giant spiders, flies and the dreaded dragon, Smaug who sleeps in a bed of gold coins. I wish I could! <br/><br/>Take care everybody."

","With the Lord of the Rings trilogy going down as some of my favourite novels and movies, and The Hobbit being one of the 1st books that I read as a young teen, I was looking forward to this movie. I wasn't disappointed. It totally rocked in the acting, special effects, music score and other than the first few minutes was a total blast to experience. I don't know if it was just me, but I think Lady Galadriel looked even more regal and powerful in this movie than in the War of the Rings trilogy. The Dwarfs were a hoot to watch. The CG was second to none and greatly enhanced the immersion factor. It gets my vote for movie of the year."

","Prior to seeing this i'd heard quite a few bad reviews about The Hobbit, the main problem being that it was 'boring' and nothing much happening in it.<br/><br/>Me being a huuuuge fan of LOTR decided to go and see it and find out for myself. I personally enjoyed it although i can see why others didn't. This is very much all about setting the scene (in fact its about an hour before we even leave Bilbo's house). The book certainly doesn't spend long focusing on the conversations between the dwarfs, Gandalf and Bilbo however being as this is gonna be three films i guess they wanted to pad it out as long as possible. As enjoyable as the film is its certainly nowhere near as dramatic as LOTR nor is their as much suspense. There is a good dose of humour though and it is good to see Sir Ian Mckellen back as Gandaf the gray, not to mention Christopher Lee playing a good Sarumon!"
"agmoldham","5","1","6","19 January 2013"," Hobbit v Lord of the Rings
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is undoubtedly my favourite trilogy of all time. The films were based on three books though and felt very natural even if the films ignored some story-lines in the books and expanded others. I was always very dubious about the Hobbit when hearing that it was to be made as a Trilogy. Was that decision based on the merits of the screenplay or based on revenue?<br/><br/>The good news is that the first part of the Trilogy was quite entertaining. You can't avoid comparisons with Lord of the Rings and it wasn't quite up to the standards of Fellowship of the Ring. My favourite sequence in the movie was when Gollum/Smeagol appeared. There was also one sequence of the film in a cave where the special effects weren't up to scratch. The film was pretty entertaining and will certainly go and see the next instalment."
"info-11400","6","1","6","30 December 2012"," Superb technique
","I watched the movie in HFR 3D. And that was pretty awesome. The picture quality is outstanding. Full of details, no picture noise. The 3D effect was without flaws. The only drawback is a video look (aka soap effect) in fast moving scenes. That looks pretty strange, but the overall quality is well worth it.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a typical Jackson film. Every single piece of the story is explicitly depicted and displayed in detail. Except for the battle scenes there is hardly any change in speed of narration. One would expect unimportant parts shortened and relevant parts highlighted. Yet that is not a virtue of the director. <br/><br/>So the film has its lengths, well a lot of lengths to my mind. 2 hrs. would have been well enough.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are huge, and hectic. A little less would have been more appropriate, for my taste.<br/><br/>So I think it is an OK-movie, and a technical milestone."

","I really had high expectations for this movie, which probably was the problem. It is a great movie, awesome visuals and entertaining dialogue/storyline. Yet, overall when it ended it wasn't epic. I wondered how they managed only to do that much in the 2.5hrs.<br/><br/>Really, LOTR fans will enjoy it no matter what (I did), but I think with all the hype created, expectations got too high and thus we are left craving more...and not in the good way. It does keep the tone of the book well, I thought, and manages a great tie-in (although avid trilogy buffs may notice a discrepancy in some details *hint*).<br/><br/>Worth seeing, splurge for 3D.

","I like LOTR and so I definitely would follow the Hobbit Trilogy. To me, the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is still entertaining though the formula to entertain hasn't changed quite much. <br/><br/>Also there is a little issue - When the dwarfs turned up unexpectedly at Bilbo's house, the first thing they said is ""At your service"". This didn't quite reconciliate with what transpired afterwards: Bilbo had to sign a risk bearing contract in order to join the unexpected journey; at one point of the journey Thorin even said that Bilbo should not have joined them; and Bilbo in fact had been servicing the dwarfs (instead of the other way round) by offering rescue at various times."

","Don't hate me... and YES, I love this movie series, but I can say with all honesty that I was a bit disappointed with this one. It is certain that the die-hard fans that are rating it EPIC, 10/10 etc. If people are being honest, this movie was NOT exceptional. I don't think it held up to the same standards as the ones before it. The fight scenes were amazing with no question. The latest graphics/3D etc. were very nice, and added great eye candy. I have read countless reviews about how awed everyone is about the Hobbit and I keep asking myself how? why?, I think it is just what people planned to say it was awesome no matter what the film did. I don't believe that this movie was amazing. I liked it, but it was fairly slow and about an hour too long. I don't mind lengthy movies if it adds a lot more value to the movie, but if an hour was cut out of this one it wouldn't have made the movie worse. The extra hour didn't add additional story/plot to the movie, it was just that, an extra hour. The end was of course expected to leave you wanting more, which it did, but the point at which the movie stopped wasn't far enough in to the story to me (not for 3 hours worth of film). I give it a 6 because I thought it should have been as good as or better than the first few, but it wasn't. Compared to some of the other movies I am awed at the amazing reviews that don't match the film..."

It is neither brilliant or bad but it sits, in my opinion, in the above average basket. The 48 frames p/s is different and takes a bit of getting used to but inovation is a good thing right? The special effects are first class. The story is not remarkable and is full of last moment, narrow escapes or victories when the ""good guys"" are outnumbered thousands to one. All in all it is an enjoyable film but not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. Those who will be disappointed will be people who have read the book (surprise, surprise) and have unreasonable expectations or those that resent the book being made into 3 parts.

","This movie was absolutely perfect, and the critics are dead wrong. The cg is great, the acting is superb, and the music is top-notch. I didn't see the high frame rate version, but the 24 fps looked great. The 3d was very complimentary to the scenery, but just a bit blurry on fight scenes, which is expected. The film fit perfectly into Jackson's Middle Earth, and the tone was much more similar to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy than I was expecting. This is a great start to the trilogy, and it's so nice to visit Tolkien's beautiful world again. The movie overall was very true to the book, and the only things changed were minor. Teasing Smaug made the movie much more enjoyable, and the Goblin sequences were done tremendously. Gollum was one of the best things in the movie, maybe even the best, and the riddles in the dark scene was exactly how I imagined it would be in the book. I can't wait for the Desolation of Smaug. Thank you Peter Jackson!"

You know instantly you are in the LOTR universe and that is an encouraging thought.<br/><br/>Kudos to Martin Freeman playing Bilbo to a T. Sir Ian is flawless as always, slipping back into the Gandalf role with ease. I was most happy to see Mr. Aiden Turner, late of BBC's ""Being Human"" in his major motion picture debut.

"EmmaDinkins","9","1","7","16 December 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: More Middle Earth mayhem.
","I am truly happy when an original story is brought to the big screen, in the case of The Hobbit it is by no means original, but Peter Jackson's treatment of it makes it feel original and new. I expected to be transported back into a world full of fantasy and adventure and was not disappointed. The opening scenes with Bilbo (Ian Holm) felt comfortable and familiar for easing into a nice long sitting. The running time was longer than I would have preferred but it is what it is. This story filled in some holes from the Lord of the Rings trilogy specifically how Bilbo (Martin Freeman) came to possess the one ring, what mass destruction came to fall upon Moria, how golf was invented and what caused the rift between the Dwarfs and Elves. This film invests the viewer in the future of the Dwarfs. There was a regal aura about Thorin (Richard Armitage), the Dwarf King portrayal was first rate and made the harrowed journey that had brought him to this point clear, as was the reason for his no nonsense demeanor. Gandalf (Ian McClellan) at several points in the film seemed to be the main focus of the story, I had to consciously remember that this was a story about a hobbit. The manipulation of events by Gandalf which allowed the adventure to take a detour to Rivendell delivered even more familiar faces. It brought a smile to my face seeing Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanshett), but I wouldn't have minded seeing Legolas once more. I couldn't help but grimace a bit when Saruman (Christopher Lee) entered the equation and began casting doubt on what was actually taking place, especially since his nefarious intentions are clearly known. This film has beautiful expansive landscapes, exquisite special effects and engaging characters. My only complaint was the two hours and forty plus minutes running time, that added with the trailers was just more time than I wanted to commit to a film, however when I emerged from the theater some three hours later it felt as though I had been in time warp, because at the end of the film that wasn't an end but a beginning, I was left wanting more. What could possibly be wrong with a film that has all nature of fantasy and where the pastime of the peaceful hobbits and wizards is puffing on a pipe with questionable contents? I give it a green light."

If anything however, this first entry does make us care about our new characters, in particular Martin Freeman. If there's one thing this is better in than any of the Lord of the Rings films, it's in its first lead character. Maybe that has more to do with Freeman being better than Wood, but he brings so much to the role. He's the MVP here and you quickly learn to love Bilbo Baggins in this stage. Solid first entry."

","""Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth is not a welcome one because for a story that seems simple he has decided to stretch it out which creates a mix of good and bad results in a poor attempt to start a three film set"" <br/><br/>Back in the early part of the millennium Peter Jackson decided to adapt the Lord of the Rings to very good results critically and financially. About ten years later he makes his return to Middle Earth with a prequel series to those once great movies. Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) reflects on a journey he had when he was young, this journey involved Bilbo helping thirteen dwarfs fight to claim back their home land from a terrible dragon who took their land many years ago. Gandalf (Iam McKellen) also joins this group as they journey across the lands helping in anyway they can such as getting help from Elf's and also using his powers when the group are in trouble.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings films are a personal favourites of everyones because of the epic scale of it all, but the difference between those films and this film along with their upcoming sequels is that some of out favourite characters do not make as big appearances and we are introduced to all these new characters who are not as fleshed out with personalities as one might want. The film is made up of some of the stories from The Hobbit book but some extra scenes come from other works by Tolkien, this decision to add extra scenes did not work as well for me because they seem out of place and just make the story not move as fast as I would want it to be. Also the choice of Jackson to use 48FPS was a failure in my mind because like many people have said you feel sick while watching all the scenes especially how it shows the imperfections of the visual effects and makeup was very distracting while watching the show.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman plays Bilbo Baggins the lead and he was perfect for the role because he provides the light heartiness that the character needs especially when we see how he develops throughout his journey. His performance is not really much to talk about only because he usually disappears into the background when sharing scenes with all the other characters that are bigger and brighter. Ian McKellen who plays Gandalf again is fine but the same thing with Freeman his performance is just setting out for maybe something to come in the future film. Andy Serkis returns as Gollum and I was blown away by the whole scene because it was the best scene in the whole film. It may be the best I have ever seen Gollum because I felt such sympathy for the character and Serkis has just mastered his performance as this character so well. The scene between him and Freeman stood out in the film because of how darkly comedic it was compared to nearly everything else in the film. There are so many characters in the film which is a negative because not much of them are fleshed out enough to be real characters but I expect something to happen to them in later films.<br/><br/>The film was too long and dragged a lot of times, I felt that a lot of scenes could either become more short or some scenes cut out would have made for a better film overall. Nice visuals throughout but with the development in film making made me see all the imperfections in the film which I have never really seen because in other middle earth films the story was so compelling unlike the story told in this film.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: C+ (MVP: Martin Freeman)"
"oble","8","1","8","17 December 2012"," ""Prequel"" That Stands on its Own
","It's hard to review a film of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey without considering the source. This is, of course, unfair, in many respects because books and movies are not the same media and thus bear different requirements and parameters for story telling. Of course, this - the first of three Hobbit movies - gets a second critical scan from a second arena that most other book-to-movie titles don't normally have as baggage - that is, it is nearly impossible to avoid comparing this to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy of which this is - at least in theory and by some measures marketing inference - a ""prequel"". I think, however, that a fair shake can be made for this movie alone. Here's my take: The movie is splendid! Period. Regardless of it's roots and any of the Middle-earth history and detail, from an entertainment standpoint and from a movie making standpoint, this first part of The Hobbit trilogy is well done.<br/><br/>I could quibble about some of the minor changes between the book and the movie or perhaps the handling of some of the scenes, the pacing in a few areas, or characters that seemed esoteric, but the truth is I didn't notice as many of those sorts of details as many reviewers lead me to believe are present. More importantly, I never felt bored with the story or in need or more information. This Hobbit chapter kept me interested throughout the entire three plus hours and I never once felt overly lost in the details. I actually told a friend that unlike The Lord of the Rings, which I feel benefit as a movie by reading the books, this rendition of the first part The Hobbit movie will make sense to most who never touch another Tolkien work. As a story, it flows fine on it's own without the need for the viewer to reach back into history to understand some presented character or plot point.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I love the Tolkien mythology and have studied mythology and ancient history for a long time and love the detail in Tolkien's world. I for one certainly appreciated the little details and treats Peter Jackson put into this movie for those of us who know the Tolkien myth well, but none of those details are particularly necessary to advance the plot or understand who is who. The story is really all right there in the manual (to steal a phrase from TV Tropes).<br/><br/>I would offer a criticism or two, but the truth is the ones that come to mind are petty or opinion-based. For instance, I'm not a big fan of the portrayal of the Goblin King and Radagast the Brown comes across as far more esoteric then I envisioned, but then both those complaints are matters of taste. Your mileage may vary. About the only objective criticism I can offer is that while we do get a nice intro for a few of the dwarfs at the beginning of the movie, keeping track of all thirteen and understanding who is who throughout the film is impossible - even, I might add, for someone who knows these characters from rereading the book far too much. However as many folks have noted, this movie is equivalent to an ""origin"" movie and as such much of each character's personality has yet to be developed and their individualities and identities will likely become more apparent and familiar in the second installation.<br/><br/>It's quite a large scope of a story and it won't be all told or well-understood until the credits roll at the end of the third installation come December 2014. Until then, this particular installment makes a fine appetizer."
"jcgerrard8","10","1","8","17 December 2012"," An expected success...
","With the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, expectations for the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey were tremendously high, with many wondering whether Jackson's return to Middle Earth would be as good as the first. Although I am going to keep comparisons between the two trilogies to a minimal, this much is clear - The Hobbit doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Jackson once again delivers a masterpiece - The return to Middle Earth is exhilarating and certain scenes (that I am not going to spoil) bring back a sense of nostalgia from previous films. By using the Appendices, Jackson adds more story to the Hobbit, explaining a lot of previously unanswered questions, such as ""Where was Gandalf during that time?""<br/><br/>However, perhaps too much may have been added, as little happens for the first 40 minutes of the film and unnecessary scenes could have been thrown out and replaced by something more....suitable.<br/><br/>Actor Martin Freeman makes a fantastic Bilbo, one who I couldn't see any other actor replace. Ian McKellen once again does an excellent portrayal as Gandalf, Richard Armitage plays the role of Thorin Oakenshield brilliantly and I don't even have to say anything about Andy Serkis.<br/><br/>The Hobbit kept me entertained from start to finish - The special effects were brilliant and throughout the whole film I was either laughing, sitting forward in my seat or staring in awe at the screen in front of me.<br/><br/>Howard Shore also does an excellent job with the soundtrack, which fits perfectly in with the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the biggest challenges for Jackson would have been the atmosphere of the film - The Hobbit was a children's book after all, and because the tone is different from the Lord of the Rings, many were worried that it may not have that ""magic"" that the Lord of the Rings trilogy had. I can honestly say, however, that I haven't enjoyed a film as much since seeing Return of the King back in 2003.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great film, one which left me satisfied all the way through (With the exception of the slow beginning.) You definitely don't want to miss out on this one.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"megatrev","8","1","8","16 December 2012"," why it's different than LOTR *no spoilers
","It feels like Peter Jackson had a job to do. To make LOTR for a younger audience. As a 3D cinematic experience this movie will amaze you with the image quality and depth. As a representation of the book? I wonder how many kids would actually bother to read it these days? For that reason I think I can forgive the drawn out story line. What I didn't expect was the cartoon-like feel to a lot of the action sequences which although violent (in a cartoonish way) lack the dark and scary feel of the LOTR trilogy. That said, the actors are well cast, the scenery is epic, Golem is even better and Peter Jackson is still the man to make these films. It's just that this time around it's more innocent and as an adult who doesn't generally enjoy kids movies, I was a little out of my comfort zone at times."

"Jack_Sparrow_82","10","1","8","16 December 2012"," Great, but completely different from Lord of the Rings
","OK, it's 3 days out and I have already seen it twice. And I will definitely see it a third time before the year is over. So, yeah, I am a fan of Tolkien and Peter Jacksons adaptations of his works. And yes, I obviously liked ""The Hobbit"" - but not instantly. Actually, after the first viewing on Friday, I didn't know what to make of it. It took a second viewing on Saturday for me to really appreciate it. I think the main reason for this is that it is so extremely different from the three LOTR movies. Yes, I read the book so I knew that it was nothing like LOTR, but I wasn't sure if the movie would be like the book or if they would try to make it more like LOTR to not scare away audiences. I was further confused by announcements that they would spice up the story with elements from other Tolkien works. Add to that the fact that they make a trilogy of probably the same length as LOTR out of a book that is about a third as thick and the confusion was complete. I honestly didn't know what to expect from this movie, and after seeing it the first time, as I mentioned already, I really didn't know what I had just seen. A friend of mine saw it without any previous knowledge other than seeing LOTR and without any expectations and he liked it instantly, so having no background on this movie seems to help a lot.<br/><br/>So, but how is it different from LOTR? Well, first and foremost, like the book, it is much more lighthearted and much less epic. There isn't the fate of the world at stake here, there is no desperate race against time and no hopeless battle against evil itself. It's just a dangerous adventure. So the movie naturally is much less emotionally engaging, much less tense and dramatic. Also ""The Hobbit"" doesn't feature as many strong characters as LOTR does. Whereas in LOTR every member of the fellowship is an interesting character in its own right, in ""The Hobbit"" only three of the company stick out while the rest are just a blur. And then there's the tempo of the movie that is much much slower than even the extended versions of LOTR. So all those reviews that are complaining about the movie being to long, they are right, in a way. The question is only if you care or not. I myself do not, because as a fan I loved every minute I could spend in this fantastic world with those lovable characters. I see that much of it might seem redundant to casual audiences, but none of it is not good or doesn't add to either the world or the characters. Think of it as a movie made for fans, with a lot of stuff that fans will love but most others will not care much about.<br/><br/>Besides that the movie is what you could expect from the director and much of the same staff from LOTR. It is a movie that is both intimate and larger than live, a movie that is both funny and dramatic. It shows beautiful landscapes and fantastic sets and effect-shots. The score is every bit as great as those of the three LOTR movies and the cast is just perfect. The biggest win here is clearly Martin Freeman as Bilbo. He is nothing short of perfect for the role and plays it with much spirit and charm. Richard Armitage plays his Thorin with charisma and authority and has a really strong presence on screen. Much like Viggo Mortensen did as Aragorn in the LOTR movies. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is even more grumpy than in LOTR, but that only makes him more likable. The other recurring characters from LOTR have only brief appearances but it's still nice to have them in this one. And then there is the scene with Gollum, and I have to say I liked this more than every scene with Gollum from the LOTR movies. It is more scary, more sad and more funny all at once than all his scenes in the other movies. Seriously this is just so great, I almost applauded! But the best bit about ""The Hobbit"" is the finale. It isn't a great action sequence, but a really dramatic emotional climax that perfectly wraps up the character exposition and development for this first movie.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" also features some spectacular action, but nothing that can live up to the Moria-sequence of ""The Fellowship"". You can tell they tried really hard to match up to ""The Fellowship"", but that movie had the Balrog in it, so naturally they failed. But it doesn't really matter for the ""The Hobbit"" has many other strengths and really does not need to fear comparison to ""Lord of the Rings"". It is different, but it is every bit as good.<br/><br/>About 3D and HFR: <br/><br/>I've seen it once in HFR and once at standard frame rate. Both were in 3D. So, does HFR look so horrible as most people say? Well, I would say that it surely is an acquired taste. Objectively it does look fantastic, almost like looking at reality. The clearness and motion sharpness really is fantastic. But that's exactly the problem. We are not used to movies looking like reality. And as ridiculous as it may sound, it makes the movie look cheap. The version i saw at normal frame rate looked much more impressive to me. My opinion here is clear: It's a movie, it isn't meant to look real. So please refrain from using HFR ever again! Luckily the BluRay version will run at 24p, so outside theaters we will be spared HFR for the next few years.<br/><br/>The 3D has impressive depth, but other than that I feel that Jackson has made very poor use of the capabilities of 3D."

"Rama1972","Null","1","9","24 December 2012"," Looks good, sounds good, but lacking depth
","This film is technically superb. The visuals are stunning. OK, 3D HFR is a but of a gamble, but at least the option of 2d with or without HFR is there as well. The film is long, but there is enough going on to keep the film entertaining enough.<br/><br/>But what lets this film down? One is characterisation. Given the film length, it shouldn't really have suffered from that. There are many characters, true, but Bilbo's character should have had more focus, but when he did, he didn't seem to be all that believable to me. The transition from being adamant about not going on the journey to joining it was not played out very well. Then his willingness to risk his life for the ponies from being eaten by the trolls didn't seem that well done either. These things we must just accept. This is what seemed to let the film down. The lack of the emotional journey. In Fellowship of the Ring, you seem to understand the subtle changes, and relationships displayed there. That is what makes the film stronger than this one.<br/><br/>Another failing for me was the amount of over exaggerated action sequences. Classic films tend to have a few real cliffhangers. This is after you are made to really care for the characters involved. The amount of contrived tension squeezed out of every scene was a bit embarrassing. Especially the last sequence in the trees. Some of the action scenes such as the fight scene against the goblins was like a cross between Super Mario World and Sonic the Hedgehog. Also, too many one in a million chance things happening one after another. It does take away from the reality (I know it is fantasy), but it makes it a bit like a Disney cartoon.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the film was the Riddles in the Dark sequence, which was very close to the book, and therefore very suspenseful. Other good things included the atmosphere and the scenery."
"harrypottervegetaria-423-432372","9","1","9","17 December 2012"," Reality (48 frames per second) meets awesomeness (3-D)
","You may ask, why is that I like every movie I watch? Is it because someone is paying me to write good reviews? No sir, I am a humble blogger with no strings attached. I only review those movies that I actually like. And I do read a critic's take on the film, but I don't let my decision be guided by them. So the fact that they say Peter Jackson is at it again – a 3 hour movie with gory deaths and one which is much like LOTR, with the technologically revolutionizing 48 frames per second giving the movie a plastic-y effect does not hold much ice. All, I would like to advice them is to zip up. Mediocrity can't handle geniuses too long! Nor can they bear their successes!!!! Why, the other day they were at the neck of J.K. Rowling for writing 'Casual Vacancy', one hears that she might have got Booker had she not written Harry Potter prior to that. I would advise you on the similar lines (of course, following it or not is upto you). Don't listen to the whiners, if you indeed want a great weekend blockbuster, 'Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey', is everything you can ask for! Lord of the Rings didn't come in 3-D, while Hobbit indeed did. You may think this to be a moot point, but the panoramic vistas that we enjoyed in LOTR are all the more enhanced by the wonderful 3-D experience. The fall of the dwarfs at the hands (talons!) of Smaug the dragon, battle with the goblins, the caves, the fight of the Mountain Stones (yes, indeed), the flight of the eagles, the water fall, Hobbiton, Rivendell – it looks beautiful in 3-D and 48 fps. I and my brother were jumping in our seats with excitement. I must say, I was a bit apprehensive about how the movie would turn out as book by JRR was indeed short. And to have a movie that's 9 hours long. But the Doubting Thomases in me pulled out the moment the movie started – there indeed are no loose ends in the movie. A tight-paced roller-coaster ride with beautiful scenery and grotesque villains (orcs, goblins, trolls!). But in the end, who indeed takes the cake? You guessed it right, it's Gollum!! Just in the book, the part where Bilbo and Gollum trade riddles (one for getting the hell out of the never ending caves, other for making the morsel out of the other!) is indeed spine-chilling. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) connects with the audience (""We have to go back, I forgot my handkerchief!""), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is at his usual best. Watch out for Thorin, the leader of the Dwarfs under the Mountain (Richard Armitage) – he is regal, silent, a bit snobbish and burning with revenge! And you have a surprise waiting at Rivendell!!! Let pseudo-purists whine! Don't let them guide you, because though 'Hobbit' may have received underwhelming response from the critics, this movie is indeed going to make your heart chase butterflies"
"RyanNilsen","8","1","9","16 December 2012"," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is Good, but more of a Set Up For the Next Films
","First of all, before I say anything, I respect Peter Jackson A LOT. The LOTR trilogy was amazing and King Kong was terrific! Jackson is the type of filmmaker who makes good judgment on where to use special effects and or CGI and where not to. He is also known for all his films being relatively ""long"" (LOTR: Return of the King 3 hours and 21 minutes). Taking on the Hobbit, Jackson is totally capable and qualified. <br/><br/>This incredible story is about a Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard, and twelve other dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield. These characters are on a quest is to take back the dwarfs stolen home Erebor from a dragon named Smaug. Once this gang of middle earthians gets on their way they encounter obstacles that surmount to intense action sequences and some repetitive humor. The scene that makes this film good takes place in Gollum's cave, where Bilbo meets Gollum and middle earth is changed forever!<br/><br/>There were a few problems with this movie that are worth addressing. This one could have been shorter. Not only could it have been, but also it ""should"" have been. Running at 2 hours and 30 minutes The Hobbit part 1 can get saggy at some parts. All around though, it ends up being a pretty action-packed and fun to watch movie. The beginning of The Hobbit is really slow. There is a lot of unnecessary back-story that was not present in the book and was a meaningless attempt at trying to link the LOTR to the Hobbit. We all know it is the prequel, you don't really need an Elija Wood cameo as Frodo to convince us. Also the characters are in the Shire for far to long. 30 minutes to be exact. The last thing that really grinds my gears about The Hobbit was the special effects. They were amazing, no doubt and may even win an academy award, but with the limited release 48 fps (films per second) that makes the movie look ""super real"", you can spot out where some things look ""fake"". Also with the special effects, all of the bad guy goblins and orc like things are CGI. What was so cool and uniqueness about LOTR was that some, not all, orcs were people in costumes and in a matter of sense ""was real"". LOTR was nominated and won the academy award for Best Costume Design. It just does not really make sense to me why they used so many special effects. However, the heart of this movie and by far best effects I have seen all year were the effects used to create Gollum. Gollum had never looked better. Whatever Andy Serkis does to create such a miraculous character is dumbfounding. Seriously, I thought he was an actual messed- up, tormented creature that may or may not be wandering around the earth today. <br/><br/>Having read the book, I was satisfied with what I saw in The Hobbit. Being ""Part 1"" it was more of a ""start-up"" film preparing audiences for an epic Part 2 and 3. For those of you who don't know, Peter Jackson has some scenes added in to this movie that were not in the book at all. They were interesting to watch, but the movie would have been just as good with or without them. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a good beginning to what I hope becomes another classic trilogy from Peter Jackson."
"eonbluedan-1","6","1","9","16 December 2012"," Baggy Bag End
","I admire Peter Jackson, coming from the world of low-budget horror, his desire to take on the epic Lord Of The Rings, and ability to deliver what he did, is hugely impressive. His love for the source material was very clear, and despite anything about that trilogy with which I may have my reservations, it was a near masterpiece. Now here we are, about a decade on, with Martin Freeman taking on the role of Bilbo Baggins, in what we could consider a prequel, though they were never written that way; truth be told, in the long-run it won't matter which way round the movies were made, this is a separate story and, importantly, a different tone.<br/><br/>There are many good things about this film, much to be admired, but Jackson's adoration for the source is still well on show, and unfortunately this means he wants to cram a lot of superfluous material in to what should have been a straightforward adaption of a children's book. Whether you be a die hard fan who remains excited for Jackson's inclusion of all sorts of other Tolkein material that isn't strictly 'The Hobbit', or a casual viewer who does not know the first thing about Tolkein's tale, one thing is unarguable, this film is far too long. With an extremely baggy introduction at bag end, and an awful lot of exposition, it is a good forty minutes or so before we hit any sort of movement in the narrative; this would not have mattered so much if a lot of the introductory material didn't end up feeling quite so inconsequential. Then there is the struggle to balance the lightness of 'The Hobbit' with the tone set by 'Lord of the Rings'; on one hand the film displays a sort of whimsy, on another it wants to be dark and epic, the prior feeling at times strangely awkward when punctuating the latter. For this critic at least, it means you never quite feel completely comfortable and 'in gear' with the movie; I think it speaks volumes that the film is at its obvious best when it is most like the previous trilogy, the Riddles in the Dark scene with Gollum clearly standing out as a highlight.<br/><br/>Then we have the choice to shoot at double the normal film speed; with many theatres still catching up with this technology, the likelihood is this won't bother most who see it projected at normal speed, but why bother shooting this way? It is commonly said to make things feel too real, and remove the magic of cinema from the piece, something I would have expected Jackson to recognise quite early on and avoid. There is no reason to see this any way other than 2D at normal speed.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, 'An Unexpected Journey' is an enjoyable film for many reasons, not least of which are the performances of Martin Freeman, Andy Serkis and Sir Ian McKellen, who can make even the most dull moment seem like more, and the score is typically gorgeous. I wait to see what the next two instalments do, but it is fair to say that based on the evidence of this movie alone, perhaps a bit more discipline and the creation of one 210 minute film may have been more wise; this is a movie that should have been incredible, but is overly bloated and feels, at times, burdened by a little too much indulgence, and so ends up being just very good."
"griffolyon12","10","1","9","14 December 2012"," Thank Goodness, It's No Phantom Menace
","J.R.R. Tolkien's classic, The Hobbit, is finally getting the big screen treatment with the first part of a planned trilogy to bring the tome to life, An Unexpected Journey, now in theaters. Thirteen dwarfs come knocking on hobbit, Bilbo Baggins' door, recruiting him as their ""burglar"" to sneak into their mountain fortress that is now under rule of a vile dragon, named Smaug. <br/><br/>Pretty much the same crew from The Lord of the Rings trilogy returns behind the camera for The Hobbit trilogy, with the first installment not only proving to be as technically impressive as the groundbreaking effects work in The Lord of the Rings, but also surpassing it in many ways. The visual effects from WETA are better than ever, with their pioneering motion capture technology having taken many significant steps since The Return of the King in 2003, with characters like the despicable, yet lovable, schizophrenic creature, Gollum, now having a wider range of emotion than he was ever able to relay in the previous installments. Of course, what makes The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey such a joy, is that it feels like coming home after a long time abroad.<br/><br/>From the first moments of the film, we see old places and old faces. From the first sights of the Shire, to Ian Holm as old Bilbo once more, narrating this story. There's Elijah Wood as Frodo in a brief cameo, and then we get reintroduced to Ian McKellen's Gandalf, while welcoming Martin Freeman into the role of a Bilbo, 60 years younger, who still manages to make us feel as if we've known his Bilbo as long as we have Ian Holm's. Even the music, by composer Howard Shore, harks back to The Lord of the Rings, with the Shire theme played as beautifully as ever before. This film just knows how to stir your memories, and already has you drawn into the story before you even really meet any new characters. With that said, while The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does feel like The Lord of the Rings, it becomes it's own thing very quickly.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey feels of the same world, but like how a film about the Gulf War will be different from a film about World War II, one is set at a more innocent time, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes that concept and runs with it. It's funnier than The Lord of the Rings, with more emphasis on humor and a wider range of traditional fantasy. Trolls did not talk in the other films, nor did Goblins, but they did in the book, and so they do in this film, often to hilarious results. Jackson and his cast and crew play up all of the British humor that Tolkien included in the book, and do not shy away from it, just to make it feel like The Lord of the Rings (which coincidentally was written twenty years after The Hobbit). Not to mention, the relentless sense of adventure from Tolkien's book is here as well. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an adventure film, it's not a majestic epic like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's like a storybook bedtime story. Many of the visuals have this golden sheen to them, of sunlight streaming through trees and climbing over mountain tops, creating an inviting aura around the scenes that was not of the prior trilogy. As well, the fellowship of dwarfs, led by the heroic, yet stubborn Thorin Oakenshield, are a camaraderie as lovable as the Fellowship of the Ring, and composer Howard Shore does not sit on his laurels, having composed a score that takes many of the cues from The Lord of the Rings and incorporating them with a new theme based on the dwarf song, ""Song of the Lonely Mountain."" It's sweeping and majestic, and brilliantly sung by musician Neil Flynn in the credits. This film truly is a feat that is equal to what has already come before it.<br/><br/>If you're already a fan of Middle Earth, you will love The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. You kind of get the feeling that Peter Jackson is no longer trying to pick up new fans with these films, but rather he's just trying to serve the already fans. The truth is, the way Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, he wrote it like a children's adventure storybook, and the film does have that feel in terms of the tone and the visuals that Jackson creates, but Jackson also takes the rare opportunity to expand Middle Earth. Using details from the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, Jackson and fellow screenwriters, Philippa Boyens, Fran Walsh, and Guillermo del Toro, flesh out areas in The Hobbit that add further depth of character to these often slight characters from the original book, allowing for a far richer, and far more emotional experience. It's actually kind of like Peter Jackson -- who released an extended version of all three Lord of the Rings' films after they came out -- decided to release the extended version in theaters this time about. Will it seem too long to someone who is just a passing cinemagoer? Probably, but to fans, it's a treasure trove of joy. <br/><br/>I give The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey a 10 out of 10!"

But the QUESTION is how is the movie?<br/><br/>Well today I want to the movie with my brother with expectations that the film would be similar to the previous films. Before you all start to yell out blasphemy or heathen, I need to tell you all that I deliberately chose for a normal viewing (i.e., without IMAX, 3D, and HFR). The reason for this decision is because I think a movie should stand on his own without any extras, it's after all the story that matters. So what did I think of this movie?<br/><br/>Well personally I think the movie was okay, it was at least much better then ""the dark knight rises (man I hate that movie)"". I'll start with the pros followed with the cons and in the end a final mark:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>The music fits the scenes very well with great orchestrated pieces.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>and the scenery/landscapes are beautiful to look at. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The characters are well developed and performed by great actors, which gives you the incentive to really join the ""unexpected journey"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is a good connection with the previous movies (sorry I can't say to much about this).</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons: - In contrast to the previous movies this movie was way to long.<br/><br/><ul><li>Personally the movie felt like a 3d animated movie like ""avatar"". (to much green screen)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sometimes it felt like the pace of the movie wasn't consistent (e.g., fast pace, slow pace etc.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>To often the action scenes were too much zoomed in.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You will never have the feeling of immersing in the movie, at least for a long period of time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It takes itself not seriously enough.</li></ul><br/><br/>As aforementioned I would say that it was a descent movie.

With a very good cast (if not perfect) that proves to have an excellent chemistry, Jackson makes a very decent adaptation of the book. <br/><br/>However this movie has the issue (and I've been told the book has it too)that it is so complex and full of detail that you may get lost at some points trying to connect the dots. This may be one of the things that leads this movie to being so long that after the first hour and a half there are several points where you take off your 3D glasses and start to get up because you think ""OK this might be a good ending"" but the movie keeps going and you see yourself returning to the same place and again and again.

The Hobbit was actually written before the Lord of the Rings was, and I genuinely find it interesting just how much of it connects to the Lord of the Rings. the true problems come from over the top comedy which really has no place in any fantasy story we are supposed to take seriously, but I suppose since the original book The Hobbit was written for children, the movie was probably trying to just be more child friendly. so its decent enough movie.<br/><br/>but I do have one huge peeve that drives me nuts. how could you take a book 300 pages long and make three movies out of it as long as a 1200 page long book?"
"frederik-verstraete","7","1","10","16 December 2012"," Bravissimo
","This is my first review What can I say except for bravissimo! It was a great movie, it has it's ups and downs. Well the first half of the movie has to be a bit boring cause you have to tell a story, and it's only the first movie of 3 so I'll give them some credits. But when they go to Rivendale the fun begins. You'll see a great scene with the likes of Gandalf, Sauraman, Galadriel and awesome Elrond. How greater can you go, I would even say a scene of LEGENDS. Thorin greatly played by Richard Armitage who plays ashtonishly I must say as the prince of the dwarfs. He really doubts if Bilboa is loyal and if he have the courage to go on. But he is very well played Bilboa by the one and only, Martin Freeman. I felt the spirit of old Bilbao alive in him. Great conception of his. A great addition also was to see old Bilbao and frodo while Bilbao tells the story. Always nice to see old faces. So as I was saying they are in Rivendale and they going to take back their Kingdom. Then after we see great action scenes, lot of orcs, courage, power, honor. Great things to strive for perfectly set in motion by the one and only Peter Jackson, you gotta live this guy.The best scene is when Thorin say this thanks to Bilboa that he has never been so wrong in all his life, touchy feely scene that was :D. Well I said enough, the only thing I would say watch and enjoy. You don't want to miss this one. I really look forward to see how the story continues."

","Saw this for the big bucks, 3D and IMAX and the cinematography was mesmerizing. I loved the beginning and end but the middle seemed to drag on and on. Saw a few people leave at the 1/2 way mark and I would've probably done the same if I were driving. The story is well plotted, just one too many battle scenes for me. I loved the Lord of the Rings so much because of the relationship between the two boys. The relationships just weren't there and the compassion seemed forced. 7 stars. I would definitely recommend the 3D. IMAX was really cool too. Too bad the movie was a bit too drawn out for my liking. Lord to the Rings fans will enjoy this film."
"lpgal9000","7","1","11","14 December 2012"," Never saw any of The Lord of the Rings films - Saw The Hobbit - Liked it
","I am not a big fan of The Lord of the Rings films simply because they are just way too long... I'm sure the films are great, but I tried watching the second one and I ended up falling asleep.<br/><br/>I went to see The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey because my best friend wanted to see it premiere night and as her best friend I came with her.<br/><br/>Initially I thought it would be long and boring, nothing interesting. However, I was corrected. The movie was very interesting to watch, the landscapes are beautiful, the characters are likable, and the dialogue (the screen writing) I thought was incredibly well done. There is a point in the film that I felt was a little boring (I don't want to spoil it so you'll see what I mean when you go watch it). However, the dull bits are saved by the amount of action that's put in the film, which I found very amusing. One bit in the film I felt was a waste of film time, it ties in with the dull bit, but again I won't say because you have to watch it.<br/><br/>So if you are a fan of the trilogy, then I say you will very much enjoy it. If you're not a big fan, prepare for a long long movie that might interest you, but might put you off because of the long talking dull bits.<br/><br/>It's a good movie."
"sundar_ramnath","9","1","11","14 December 2012"," Go and Watch it for the Visuals
","To Start off, I'm a fantasy freak and a huge fan of Peter Jackson's movies. I went to this movie mainly to see what different did he do from TLOTR and i must admit the movie was amazing. The start is slow since the characters needs introduction and once the mission is revealed the movie takes off at an amazing pace. I watched this movie in Real 3D and not in HFR 3D, so i didn't get a chance to enjoy the 48fps visuals, but nevertheless the visuals were stunning. The movie is quite long, it runs for nearly 160mins, but you would never know how the time runs off. Bilbo Baggins portrayed by Martin Freeman has acted so naturally and steals the show. He brings in the humor element. His Journey along with the thirteen dwarfs forms the main plot of the movie. All thirteen dwarfs have equal importance, but Thorin stands out. Ian Mckellen has once again proved that he's the best. No one could have played Gandalf better than him.<br/><br/>The movie has amazing visuals and the graphics are excellent. Experience the movie in 3D. There are lot of new characters like goblins and wargs. Gollum is back and his encounter with Baggins is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie. There isn't lot of actions/stunts and the end is quite disappointing. But nevertheless, go and it as you will definitely enjoy this epic. Peter Jackson has done it again."
"Tuscon14","7","1","13","23 December 2012"," A little Disappointed
","I grew up reading the books and was pleased with Peter Jackson screen adaptation of the trilogy. Reading some of the reviews I can see I will be in the minority here but I had some problems with this latest film. First is the actual film process which is 48 frames per minute which makes the film look sharp but loses the effect of an old story being told. It looks more like a fan based short put on youtube. Second the dialogue used in the film makes a number of references to modern culture and language which takes you out of the story for a split second which seems to me to be a major error if you want to be lost in Tolkien. A number of the film sequences felt like filler including a scene with rock giants battling it out and trolls three stooges routine. Again the film makers use flying eagles to save the day which begs the question, Why not fly all the way from point A to point B? <br/><br/>The special effects are truly remarkable but what really saves this movie for me is the performance of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. He plays the character to perfection and his scene with Gollum (played by Andy Serkis) was a joy to watch.<br/><br/>I know most will feel I am nitpicking but I maintain that if a book you are reading or movie you are watching fails to make you forget everything put the story than it has not fully succeeded.<br/><br/>Nice try though."

","It has taken me 7 years since its premiere to watch it for the first time and I Loved it. I have read the book 3 times but that does not matter at all. I never compare films with books because that is a total stupid thing to do. They are never the same. What is the point of making a film of a book and keep it the same? FIlms are not reproductions like they do with paintings so you can have a copy in your living room. Is that what some critics want a copy? So for me a film is always a whole new adventure. And I love this genre. The movie is a lot of fun. The hobbit was written as a children story and Peter Jackson has remained true to that idea. It is not to serieus, there is never a slow moment, there are a lot of laughs, some singing and i loved the funny dwars. The star of this movies is again Theresa May, oeps sorry, Gollum. It could have been a 30 minutes shorter though, because my bottoms hurt after a 3 hours sit and i ran out of crisps and beer.

Going from Bilbo's house in the Shire to the Gobelins town passing by Rivendale and the Troll's cave, that movie gives you many different and colorfull landscape where each scene is a treat for the eyes and where all the different characters are memorable by their charisma.

"zanghi_james","9","0","1","4 September 2019"," Definitely one of the best prequels ever made as well as a cinematic adaptation of a novel
","(This is a review of the Extended Edition of the movie)<br/><br/>I grew up as a kid reading J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit, watching the animated films on Videotape, and going to the theaters to watch the Peter Jackson live-action trilogy. Naturally, Peter Jackson's trilogy adaptation of Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite film series to watch and I had no doubt he would do an adaptation of The Hobbit sooner or later. There was a bit of a wait for The Hobbit Trilogy, but it was worth it. I saw all three in theaters and loved them, and much like Lord of the Rings, I made sure to get the Extended Edition of each film.<br/><br/>This film is a worthy prequel to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Since it had the same director, writers and all the other crew members, I was pretty sure it would do well. Plus, one of my favorite fantasy directors helped write the script: Guillermo del Toro. How cool was that?<br/><br/>For those who have not read the original books by Tolkein or haven't seen any of the previous films (animated or live-action), the narrative is pretty easy to follow and doesn't rely on The Lord of the Rings trilogy too much. There are references to the Lord of the Rings, though, abounding in this film alone. If you have watched the Hobbit trilogy first before watching LOTR, you may have to go back and re-watch the Hobbit again, as there are plenty of great references and Easter Eggs to find.<br/><br/>The acting and casting, as usual, is brilliant. Martin Freeman is perfectly cast as a young Bilbo Baggins. I had only seen him, I believe, in Hitchhiker's Guide (another great adaptation of a great novel) and maybe one season of Sherlock before watching him nail it as Bilbo. Bilbo's story-arc in this movie is an excellent example of a reluctant hero going from a regular average person to a brave and courageous individual.<br/><br/>The returning characters from the LOTR trilogy are numerous. The best is, of course, Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey Wizard. Despite his famous claim in Fellowship as being 'barely involved in the business with the Dragon', Gandalf is much more of a center-stage character in this story. Christopher Lee brings his usual gravitas and darkness to Saruman the White, while Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving reprise their iconic roles of Galadriel and Elrond with a few surprises to their characters' (especially Galadriel!) story-arcs that help flesh them out. Also, Elijah Wood makes a nice cameo at the beginning, returning as Frodo (I had been wondering what he had been up to after LOTR and Sin City).<br/><br/>For new characters, this film is amazing. A big surprise to me (and most Tolkein fans, I have noticed) is the inclusion of Radagast the Brown Wizard. He is played superbly, lovably, and hilariously by Sylvester McCoy. His character is both a wacky crazy man and at times has a few great serious scenes, especially with his Rhosgobel Rabbits outrunning a bunch of Gundabad Wargs!<br/><br/>But the truly best new characters are the Company of Thorin a.k.a. the Dwarves. I love how diverse they are in comparison to the Dwarves from the Animated Movie.<br/><br/>Richard Armitage does a wonderful job as Thorin Oakenshield, playing him as a tough-as-nails warrior but who is also compassionate and loyal to his people. Ian Stott is my personal favorite as Balin, with Graham McTavish coming in second as his bada$$ older brother Dwalin (who looks like a character who could tear Khal Drogo and the Night King apart with his bare hands...okay, maybe at least Khal Drogo and Euron Greyjoy.). Bofur is my third favorite, followed by Kili, Bombur, and Oin.<br/><br/>The villains are awesome, also. I love the new look of the Orcs, especially Azog (played by Manu Bennett, aka Slade from Arrow!). I also think the subtle reveals of Smaug and ""the Necromancer"" in the film are nice touches.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's score is, as usual, perfection. I love his use of choruses and also using songs from the book. If you get the Extended Edition, you'll more than likely love the 'Goblin-Town' song.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it's a great film"

And back then I quite liked the movie, so much in fact that I bought a DVD as soon as it came out. But having watched the extended version just now something has changed. Maybe because my attitute towards the whole franchise in general has changed over the years. I was glad to be back in Middle Earth and to revisit Bilbo, Gandalf and many many characters' cameos from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it felt nostalgic and still like a part of a familiar and a bigger story once told to me that was fresh in my memory. But something was missing. Maybe I didn't like Martin Freeman's Bilbo as much as I loved Ian Holm's performance (which made the beginning of the movie almost perfect); maybe the whole set-up for the story was too far-fetched; maybe I wasn't fond of dwarfs' singing segments but I do know one thing - I still enjoyed the movie very much and turned on ""The desolation of Smaug"" right after this one ended. Cinematography, score, landscapes, most of the actors' performance are of highest level but I will not be getting back to this movie ever again because of how unnecessary, uninteresting and pointless this whole story feels while watching. Did we really need the prequels?"
"maxglen","7","0","1","18 February 2019"," Not Lord of the Rings but the Hobbit
","These films are understandably very divisive, I've heard people who hate them, I've heard people who prefer them to the LotR films and I personally don't fall into either of those camps. I think these films are good, not very good or great but good. Some moments rival scenes from that of the Lord of the Rings films like Gollum and Bilbo's riddle game or any scene with Smaug from the 2 sequels but when it comes to consistency these films do fall a bit short. Martin Freeman lends his timid self to Bilbo excellently making for one of the most engaging and likeable performances in the whole Middle-Earth series. Ian McKellen is back and is (almost) as good as ever but I can't help but feel he is slightly off at times. The dwarves are for the most part likeable but few stand out as scene stealers. the CGI is a mixed bag, it's sometimes excellent and always good but can be a little overwhelming at times as opposed to the balance that the LotR films offered for the most part. There is a lot of padding which has been criticised by viewers and another point of concern is why there is 3 films for one book but all the padding in the film is in the books and anyone who has read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings know that the Hobbit is a lot more dense than any of the LotR books in terms of how much story it fits in its pages. At the end of the day the Hobbit is it's own series that fell victim to high expectations and association with the masterful trilogy that came a decade prior. If you can separate the two and enjoy fantasy I think you will have a good time. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey gets a 7.5 from me."

","I think like everybody I watched the triology hoping to get the same affection as Lord of the Rings but did I get it: NO
Because: the biggest problem is that it does not create the feeling that you are in the movie. I watched it as a cartoon.
Another problem is that Gandalf does not have the control, even Aragorn in Lord of the Rings could not get before the role of Gandalf
Scenes were created for the sake of the filling any gap, forexample in one scene suddenly an elf on the horse appears before Legolas summoning him to their country. Well at least they have showed him coming on the road in the far away camera before appearing.
Another problem was composing, the music stole away the seriousness of the movie turning it into combination of the scenes where the outcomes were predictable.

","Unfortunately, The Hobbit did not know what it wanted to be. It jumped between being the fun adventure that the book is to being a dark brooding setup for the LOTR trilogy. Far too many extraneous side stories found their way into this overly long and bloated children's story. The film should have been cut down to one 3 hour or, at the most, two 2 hour movies. Filling up some extra minutes with some Middle Earth backround information was ok, but a lot of extra junk that was unnecessary was thrown into this trilogy and especially into the Desolation of Snaug. In all honestly the best parts of these films were the stuff that was taken directly out of the book."

","First off in case you don't know lotr and hobbit are very different stories and shouldn't be compared . lotr is a darker story, about a hobbit that needs to destroyed an evil ring created by great evil. Meanwhile in the hobbit , a hobbit goes on an epic adventure with a bunch of dwarves and a wizard to kill a dragon and take back the dwarves' treasure. Everyone that's is comparing the genre of the hobbit to lotr needs to stop NOW! The hobbit is a kid book for goodness sake and lotr is aimed for older people.<br/><br/>Anyway let's get straight down to business. The movies had a great plot and amazing action scenes though had cgi problems.The movie was slow paced since it is the first movie of the trilogy and the first movie is always slow like star wars a new hope,lotr the fellowship of the ring and more.Adding characters like Radagast was pretty unnecessary,few scenes weren't that good but the Gollum scene was scaring and intense when he finds out that Bilbo stole his ring.The orcs look pretty meh... should had used real people dressing up as orcs.<br/><br/>the action scenes were just fantastic. the best action scene was when throin was fighting azog ,gave me goosebumps a little bit.great character development with Bilbo though It may not show much since it is just the beginning of the hobbit series and you don't want him a lot of character development too early or else that would make the movie a bit rushed. Plus how thorin in the beginning of the movie he doesn't trust Bilbo at all and thinks he worthless and in the end he admits he's wrong is pretty good character development. We also get know his backstory .<br/><br/>overall I give the hobbit a 7/10

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey starts off with a compelling story and mesmerizing settings as we get to go back to the wondrous place of Middle-Earth. Being a longtime fan of both the Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit movies and books I was one of the first on getting tickets to see the movie on premiere night. From the very start of the opening monologue by the amazing actor Sir Ian Holm I felt the same feelings of magic, adventure, wonder and excitement just as I had done 11 years earlier when I saw Fellowship of the ring. <br/><br/>Once again one of the strongest compartments is the amazing casting, as it feels that they really found the perfect guy in every role to play the character. Even though the movie does not follow the book strictly in my opinion this does not necessarily make it bad. For what many reviewers seem to forget is that the medium of film and book is very different, and sometimes changes need to be made for it to work on the big screen. <br/><br/>For all fantasy lovers and fans of the world that J.R.R Tolkien created this is a movie that cannot be missed.<br/><br/>8/10 Very Good!"
"mundhra_mayank","8","0","1","15 January 2018"," Different from the book, but for the better
","Probably everyone is going to compare this movie with the LOTR, which isn't a completely fair comparison. I am a huge LOTR fan, and I watch the trilogy every 6 months. But a better reference point for this movie must be the book by Tolkien. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson does a great job at not just bringing the book to life, but also adding on to it elements which make it even more fun. For example the movie has a lot of funnier elements when compared to the book. The dwarves are funnier, livelier and definitely more charismatic (especially Thorin) as compared to the movie.<br/><br/>Jackson has also tried to make this a prelude to the LOTR. Like adding Legolas (who isn't even mentioned in the book), and the necromancer. While fans of the book might not have liked so much of fiddling with the story line, I personally don't mind this.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a inspired from LOTR, and in some placed even the same (like the scenes involving Elrond in Rivendell), but it works just as magically as it did in the trilogy. The visual effects are top notch and the goblin chase gives one goosebumps. The entire movie is very feel good and you don't feel tense even in the moments where the pack is in trouble. All in all, a great adventure movie."
"siderite","8","0","2","25 December 2017"," A lot better than rumoured
","Of the three movies that I've just watched back to back, the starting one is the most decent. The characters are getting built, their relationship and story are getting spun and, considering I was expecting an incredible bore of ""a movie made by Hollywood for money from a book just 50 page long"", I quite enjoyed it. The other two films go more and more over the top until they get into Pirates of the Caribbean territory, but this one was OK. Of course, that doesn't really mean anything, since you have to have seen all three movies to form an opinion, but I am just saying that if they went for the same recipe, this could have been a wonderful trilogy.<br/><br/>What I felt it was obvious is that it is a true Lord of the Ring film series and that even if they had to improvise a lot, they did it in line with what they did in the LOTR movies."
"A_Kind_Of_CineMagic","5","0","1","1 December 2017"," OK film but nothing special and apparently animals died as a result of filming
","I won't go into too much detail about my thoughts on this film. It was OK as entertainment, nothing special or very impressive as far as I am concerned and I reduced the rating I gave from 6.5/10 to 5/10 when I heard that animals (27 farm animals) died as a result of filming. If these deaths were caused deliberately by stunts or mistreatment on purpose then I would reduce the score further but it was more due to negligence it appears. As a result I will give some credit that ""accidents and mistakes can happen"" but it really is unacceptable in this day and age for animal welfare to not be given proper care. That therefore mars what was an acceptable piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Artistically I am not a fan of Peter Jackson and find this film includes some of his usual overblown nature. Visuals are sometimes wildly over the top in the CGI causing jarringly unreal and muddled action scenes and there are pretentious traits Jackson has, trying to be 'clever' or 'impressive' without achieving those aims which reduces the impact of the drama. There is fun and entertainment to be had but this is not the best possible adaptation of Tolkein's classic and has plenty of flaws. At best I would rate it 6.5 to 7/10 for quality but I have reduced the rating due to animal welfare negligence as I have described."

"JackVenturo","4","0","1","3 January 2017"," Three point of view review.
","The year is 2012. The month is December. The movie? The Hobbit! Of course there is no other movie to discuss than the long anticipated prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"" and there is a lot of talk about the movie so let's get started!<br/><br/>Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I loved the movie I am a fan-boy of middle earth true. And yes it is also true that I have not read the books because I don't enjoy reading so this will not be a comparison of the book to film translation but that's not why you came here anyway so it's OK. <br/><br/>The first trailer was so good that it gave me chills! When the dwarfs start singing I was in! I saw the movie and I left with a feeling of satisfaction. It's rare to have that feeling knowing there will be two more sequels but they did a great job on that. I know there is more to see and I am OK with that. It was interesting to see all the old faces again. Also, there is much talk about the Galadriel & Gandalf relationship in that seemed like it could be a prequel of its own but we won't. We will let time and the rest of the movies reveal that on their own. <br/><br/>Huge props to Martin Freeman who just sinks into the role of Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellen who just sits comfortably back into the robes of Gandalf the Grey. You can't forget to mention the nightmares you get when you think about anyone else other than Peter Jackson directing this movie.<br/><br/>Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says The Hobbit: An Unexpected PROBLEM. Did anyone else cringe a little when they saw full CGI characters? I mean you are used to Gollum who by the way looks great and more wicked than before, he is an untamed creature in this movie and it is quite scary. <br/><br/>There was a problem with the Great Goblin and the trolls as well as Azog the white orc and yes even the goblins too. There was plenty of CGI done in the LOTR movies but this was somehow different. Was it perhaps the frame rate they used? Maybe they tried a different technique? For some reason these characters suffered and it was a bit unsettling for me to watch. <br/><br/>The music was great. The filming was awesome. The acting was top notch; however I also have a bit of a problem with the dwarf's beards and hair. Always perfectly quaffed and still, clean and braided and always hair sprayed in the right place was just another little thing that bothered me a bit.<br/><br/>Jack ""The Parent"" says My four year old daughter loved the movie. She was scared a bit when Gollum showed up. I'm telling you he was crazy! She usually likes fantasy movies of this kind anyway but mostly I would not recommend it for anyone younger than ten because it is a bit long and a bit dark in a lot of areas. It's a good movie for the older kids to watch to see the importance of teamwork and companionship and honor and to finish what you start and not to quit. Plus they will see and learn an awesome way to wash the dishes."
"bilbobrick","8","0","3","5 December 2016"," The Start of Another Great Adventure
","It really shocks me that The Hobbit films have had such a negative response, especially since most critics seemed to like them, particularly here on IMDb. Saying these films are on the same level as the Star Wars prequels is just absurd. I firmly believe that the only reason people hate these movies so much is because they aren't the Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson created such a masterful trilogy with LOTR, that most people were only going to be interested in The Hobbit if it was on par with it. And granted, it's not. But it's a great story in its own right, with just enough alterations from/additions to the book to keep audiences entertained. <br/><br/>The first installment of The Hobbit does take its time to get started-- the second act doesn't begin until over 40 minutes in-- but that's not really a problem here. Considering we still have two movies to go, (and extended editions, which I would highly recommend) the lengthy build-up works well. In the book, most of the dwarfs are cardboard characters with no depth or story to them, but here, Jackson and Co. have attempted (successfully, for the most part) to give them personalities and stories. We also have to learn a bit about Bilbo and the reason for this grand adventure, all the while spending some time in the beautiful Shire. <br/><br/>From here on out, the Hobbit still meanders a bit, but inserts plenty of action and fun characters between the exposition and dialogue scenes to keep its audience entertained. There are also enough ties to the LOTR trilogy to keep fans of the universe satisfied, but not to the point of distracting from the main story. <br/><br/>Overall, An Unexpected Journey is not a perfect film by any means, but is still a very fun ride, and infinitely better than most action/adventure movies churned out these days. If for no other reason, check it out so you can then watch the superior second film, The Desolation of Smaug."

","This was truly one of the best films I've ever seen!!! I could watch this 3 times in a row, for real, it never bores! Definitely just as good as the Lotr series, if not better! Some people might have a preference for this film, as it emphasizes humour and adventure rather than warfare, although it already has references to the ""rising darkness"" that we know from lotr. It actually reminds me of the atmosphere in The Fellowship, perhaps it's the similarity of some characters or the sense of excitement and adventure, I'm not sure...<br/><br/>From the very start of this film I thought ""yes! Tolkien's back on the screen all right!!!"", went to see this at the movie theatre and I got truly ecstatic, this is one of these films people get truly addicted to :D Even if you're not usually into the fantasy genre it's something everyone should watch, it's also a very nice film to watch as a family, it has many interesting elements, not just stunning fantasy special effects but also very good humour and deep-going character development.<br/><br/>I love what they've done with the story, although Tolkien's novel is somewhat childish and wasn't meant to be nearly as serious or as extensive a story as Lotr, the film makers have turned it into a Lotr- worthy masterpiece!:D<br/><br/>So you don't need to worry about this being a watered down version of Lotr made for commercial purposes, it's not! This is just as good - if not better - than the Lotr films and is definitely a must see for all!!!:D"

","When news of the newest instalment of the lord of the rings movie series first hit the media, people lost their minds about this epic fantasy, but should they have been? As a person who considers himself a Lord of the rings fanatic the answer would have to be yes! A fantasy world portrayed and filmed through a 3D-blue-ray camera,incredibly built sets, and the most stunning scenic views of New Zealand. Many others have been very critical of the movies, calling them: Unoriginal,copies of the first, a train wreck, just to name a few things I've heard. However, what many of the Lord of the Rings elitist choose to not acknowledge is that a film can never be the same as a book, only a different interpretation, a different opinion on an already great topic; and no two different interpretations of the same masterpiece will ever be the Identical. This film,however, does a great job at not only retelling the immortalized Epic that The Hobbit is, but it also incorporates many of the lost tales- unfinished stories written by Tolkien himself to help fill in the gaps of the story. All in all, a great film for the whole family, and a great way to get the kids to want to go outside."

"jard-81779","9","0","4","12 August 2016"," Stop the comparisons
","The Hobbit has been getting backlash because it is being compared to one of the best, if not, the best trilogy of all time : The Lord of the Rings. Think of it as a standalone trilogy because while it is true that it is not better than LOTR, it is still one hell of a series. <br/><br/>Now, focusing on "" An unexpected Journey "". It has a very slow start indeed, but I do not find it bad. The first 45 minutes are basically Gandalf getting the dwarfs to get in Bilbo's house which turns into a mess. They do also explain the main goal behind the story. It might be slow paced but it does indulge you into the story.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, we do get some cool scenes on Bilbo's voyage but we still find our fellow friends far away from their goal, not really advancing in the plot. <br/><br/>Lack of memorable action scenes were the main problem for me, but I still found the movie to be awesome and a great introduction to the trilogy. Final Verdict : 8/10"
"munotrushab","8","0","3","7 August 2016"," Very good but has a few mistakes
","A must watch, excellent scenes, wonderful sound effects and nice comedy. The diversity of the characters and the way they are portrayed by Peter Jackson is outstanding. The hobbit Bilbo, Gandalf the Grey Wizard, the dwarfs, their king Thorin Oakenshield, the 'creature' Gollum.... Thought there are differences compared to the book, the movie is wonderfully adapted.<br/><br/>The story starts with Gandalf and the dwarfs arriving at Bilbo's house and Gandalf choosing Bilbo as the 'burglar', the thirteenth member of the company. The story then plunges into the adventures of the company. And you can feel the adventure going through. But, I would say, the movie has some major mistakes. Starting with the introduction, it is unnecessarily long and boring at points. The dwarfs do not need to throw Bilbo's dishes around for minutes, and there is no need to keep on showing the filthy ways of dwarfs for another few minutes. The tricks that Bilbo uses on the trolls are quite amusing and comic too. However, these tricks can get you mad after a while because these people get saved at the last moment of every situation they fall into. Funny that they get away from the orcs, the trolls, and hundreds of goblins without so much a scratch, not to mention huge rocks crashing down on them. And there are childish things to add to them, rock giants fighting against each other is the limit. Its boring. But then it all changes when Bilbo falls inside Gollum's cave. The character Gollum is itself one of a creation. Kudos to the writer and the physical makers of the character. Not to mention the end of the movie where the to-be dwarf king Thorin is saved by Bilbo. Though they spoil it again up when Gandalf calls the eagles by sending a message through a butterfly. That's the edge of fantasy, seems to feel like a fairy tale. But this wont spoil it for you as thats not the real end. It matters that the heroes win.<br/><br/>The sound and videographic effects are excellent when the company is attacked by orcs on wargs. The landscapes are beautiful. And the best part of it is that the mood is light throughout the movie."
"mark.waltz","8","0","2","16 May 2016"," Children's literature for adults.
","One of the very first ""adult"" examples of modern literature I had to study in school was the fantastic literature if J.R. Tolkien. With ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" being the ""Harry Potter"" series of their day, they were instant classics that succeeded in their efforts to get pre-teenagers to read. In fact, they were so popular with advanced English literature teachers that I got to study them twice: first in my eighth grade English class, and later in High School in a rather adult version of ""children's literature"".<br/><br/>Around that time, both ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" were filmed-""The Hobbit"" as an animated T.V. feature and ""Lord of the Rings"" for the big screen. Both were produced by Rankin Bass, and only covered the highlights of the novels. It took a few more decades for these to come out as big screen remakes, and when they did, great detail was made to capture everything. The wait was worth it, because the results were outstanding.<br/><br/>Tied together through several supporting characters, ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" are never the less completely different stories, set in the mysterious ""middle world"" where bizarre creatures live around hobbits, dwarfs, elves, wizards and earth like mammals. Trolls, goblins, giant rock like creatures and huge spiders are among the feared creatures, but they don't compare to the fearful dragon whose love for gold helped destroy one of the middle world's finest lands.<br/><br/>Certainly, the computer generated effects makes this all the more intense, with the battle scenes quite realistic and brutal. Leading the story is the mild mannered Bilbo Baggins, the homebody hobbit who is brought into the adventure of a lifetime. Gandfolf, the wizard, takes over Bilbo's hole in the hill, and before you can break into the Jabberwocky, you're out in the woods, fighting all these various evil creatures to help dethroned prince Thorin recapture his kingdom, now being guarded by the evil dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>Continuing his role as Gandolf is that wonderful stage veteran Sir Ian MacKellan, finely supporting Martin Freeman as Bilbo. This covers the first quarter of the book, taking the audience through many adventures in a fast moving three hours. Whether it be Bilbo's capture by the trolls, the sudden fight between moving rock formations or the final battle with the goblins, you will never find yourself bored. You might want to keep aspirin near by just in case, as the sound through your stereo may become a bit overwhelming. This isn't the type of series to rush through non-stop, but watch pieces at a time. Then, you might want to re-visit the Ray Harryhausen classics of the golden age which highly influenced either Tolkien or the filmmakers, or possibly both."
"user-196-766417","8","0","2","3 August 2015"," It's nowhere near as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but still a decent adaptation and a refreshing visit to Middle-Earth.
","Yep. Summary says it all. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a fairly good film, but it has too many problems to live up to the cinematic masterpiece that was ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.<br/><br/>It feels like Jackson and the writers are confused about the direction and the audience of the film. On the one hand, they've tried to imitate the deep, dark tone of ""The Lord of the Rings"", but they've also shoved in a lot of silly, slapstick humour that appeals to children. It just doesn't work together, and the result is the episodic mishmash that is ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"".<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>Jackson has done it again. With the magnificent scenery of New Zealand and beautiful visual design of - well, just about everything - ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a wonderful return to the beautiful, dangerous, epic world that is Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>The story is adapted generally quite consistently from the book. It deviates a little and adds tons of information like the Battle of Azanulbizar and the White Council's discussion at Rivendell. In my opinion, these ideas were worthy additions to the film as they explore the dwarfs' and Sauron's backstories, but I think they were executed quite poorly, for reasons I'll expand on later.<br/><br/>The actors are well-chosen. Ian Mckellen is amazing in pretty much everything he's in. Martin Freeman brings a bit of comedy and light- heartedness to the film, while Richard Armitage is perfectly proud and austere as the brooding Thorin Oakenshield.<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>Waaaaaaaaaaay too much CGI. The orcs in ""The Lord of the Rings"" were terrifying because they were real, made-up extras, not some fake- looking computer-generated image. Also, did Azog and his crew need to have so much screen time? We already understand how dangerous the quest is, and how Thorin has many enemies on his trail. The orcs didn't really add anything to the story, which should have been more concentrated on developing the characters of all thirteen dwarfs.<br/><br/>I feel that the main problem in this film was that the filmmakers tried to imitate the slow, grand tone of ""The Lord of the Rings"". Almost every single line of dialogue is spoken way too slowly, the pacing seems to be held back, and the action has too much slow- motion. What should have been really interesting scenes (like the Council at Rivendell and the Battle of Azanulbizar) are ruined by their overdramatic overtones.<br/><br/>The alright:<br/><br/>Howard Shore returns to score this film. He reuses quite a lot of motifs from ""The Lord of the Rings"" in all the right places, and new material in the others. However, his new additions are pleasant but mediocre, epic but unmemorable. They don't contain the subtlety that he created in ""The Lord of the Rings"". Still, the ""Misty Mountains"" theme is fairly nice, and the music sets the tone well, so I guess it's not all that bad.<br/><br/>The humour is quite subjective. I found most of it quite unfunny, but there were memorable scenes like Bofur and his table-dancing. But undoubtedly, humour is incredibly subjective and differs with everybody.<br/><br/>Look, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a decent film. It is far from living up to the standard set by Jackson in ""The Lord of the Rings"", but is a nice return to the visual world of Middle-Earth."

","Pretty good movie. I'm not fan of these kinds of fantastic movies at all and I have not read the book of J.R.Tolkien but I should say that this is a good one. Characters very well defined, marvelous scenes and landscapes and a plot in which you will easily keep focused on. And of course, superb special effects. It can be a little bit hard to get used of the names and nomenclature of all the fantastic creatures of the movie, but once the movie goes on you will not be worried about that anymore. Without any hesitation I strongly recommend watching it. Let's see weather the second part of The Hobbit is as good as this one or not."
"willcundallreview","7","0","3","14 June 2015"," Has bad points, but comes out good nevertheless
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>We have returned to Middle-earth in film again and brought along with it hobbit's, dwarfs and of course Gandalf the Grey. This isn't so much a triumphant return as maybe I or others wanted but I found nevertheless this to be good fun and the start to an adventure that looks like it could be also good fun. It has it's bad points, it even has bad points in parts the producers think are good, but lets not get into that just yet. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman plays our small hero Bilbo Baggins and he has an air of awkward always surrounding him, I didn't like him too much in the role but he matches it well enough. With so many of the dwarfs it is hard to pick one of them who stands out, Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield is like Freeman OK but doesn't step up his performance from others, the powerful character becomes hard to control. Ian McKellen reprising his role as Gandalf the wizard is good too, no one stands out in the entire film in truth, but none are really bad though.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson takes the helm and takes it firmly, he churns out a pretty good movie, one that he can be proud of(but almost too close to failing to be that proud). Jackson is joined by Guillermo Del Toro and others in adapting this and they do a fine job, many films fail to shake off the book but I feel this is one that can be remembered slightly without thinking the book is always better. Jackson manages to bring the actors close, creates a sense of brotherhood and ignites old rivalries we thought maybe ended in the Lord of the Rings film series, good to see that.<br/><br/>Now coming on swiftly into the technical section of the movie, and precisely the special effects, they are very over used. This movie seems to rely solely on green screen type tactics to make us think we are seeing whatever is supposed to be there, problem is it is in so much abundance, it becomes almost like effects sickness. Now they aren't bad, and by no stretch are they not well made(this is top quality), the only problem is they are used way too much and the film could have benefited from more real sets if truth be told.<br/><br/>This certainly isn't a new kind of film, sure we have never seen the book adapted in such massive big screen presence, but this doesn't come off as slick or smart like the Lord of the Rings movies do. I think the movie is a very sweet kind of nice movie, sure it has it's dark parts but mostly it is very fun like, a fantasy quest, not an action filled with blood and guts. It certainly suffers from it's length as well, at near three hours long this makes it shorter than the Lord of the Rings but still too long, I find it may have been hard for Jackson to find a point on which to end.<br/><br/>So overall if you are going to watch a movie that includes fantasy, adventure, action and the like, well this may be for you, but maybe not also. I would't recommend this too all as it can at times as mentioned feel too ""nice"", not enough darkness maybe for some and it does suffer from a slight lack of epic-ness in scale. This is of course part of a Trilogy so don't ever expect the first film in that to be that best, this actually could be though so if your going to watch them all don't miss this one out, it's mighty important not only in the Hobbit, but also for the Lord of the Rings."

Somethimes they spoil the movie and it is not nice to watch, but in this case its OK. The movie starts slow, a bit predictable, but ends good. The story is as we know it, it has been mentioned before in the LOTR so there are no real surprises, maybe because i read the book. Animation is in one word good, as we know of LOTR.

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes us back to Middle Earth, but this time it's the telling of the story of Bilbo Baggins and his, well, unexpected adventure in how he comes to help dwarfs reclaim their kingdom and how he come to find the one ring.<br/><br/>This movie's an absolute eye feast and is just as big as Peter Jackson's other Lord of the Ring's movies. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the photography's amazing and the cast of characters are really well done, with actors like McKellen, Serkis, Lee etc reprising their roles. Maybe the battle scenes are not as big, but that's obviously a given as this is 13 dwarfs, a wizard and a hobbit who engage in battle scenes and not a massive army.<br/><br/>As a personal side note, regarding the two or three dwarfs who have Scottish accents...it was very refreshing to hear REAL Scottish accents from REAL Scottish actors. Being from Scotland myself, there's nothing worse in hearing a grounds keeper Willie or Christopher Lambert Highlander-type Scottish accent in movies. Another wee thing I'm glad about is the rating. The PG13 keeps the scenes that are supposed to be tense and creepy as such and are not toned down to seem ""cartoonish"". It would have been totally unjustified to have made these scenes anything less than what they were supposed to be as the sense of atmosphere they bring is excellent.<br/><br/>Now, ardent followers of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books will no doubt complain about things that are in the book but not the move, or things that are in the movie but aren't in the book, but this is a movie adaptation and it's not as if the book was butchered like what Stanley Kubrick done to The Shining (even though that was still a fantastic movie in it's own right). I've read the book and enjoyed that, and now I've seen this 1st part to the movie adaptation and thoroughly enjoyed that. I can only hope that the next part is just as enjoyable as this one.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend seeing this movie."

","The Hobbit an Unexpected Journey<br/><br/>60 years before the adventures of the Lord of the Rings it is the first time, in the Shire, Bilbo meets Gandalf. Bilbo than a young man is having a regular Hobbit life, mostly in love with his books and his armchair. But When Gandalf comes into his life things are going to change when he ask him to go on a quest. Bilbo is absolutely not interested but Gandalf won't give up. Gandalf arrives again at Bilbo's house with a big group of dwarfs. They come to talk about the quest but mostly persuading Bilbo to go with them on the quest. A quest to reclaim the homeland of the dwarfs. After a long time Bilbo decides to go and his life will be changed forever when is going on a life changing journey. <br/><br/>As complicated as the books are the filmmakers had to make choices in order to make a good film based on the Middle earth universe. And it is obvious that in the Hobbit director Peter Jackson already dared to put more his own turn into the script. And that was something he did in the Lord of the Rings series, there he was constant faithful to the material. In the Hobbit there are things you don't find in the books. That is a very tricky decision and not every fan will like that. Some decisions are not so good while others were. Having said that; The story of this first film is great. You already see a great character development in the first film and the film is very excited and it keeps you watching it. Constantly there is happening something excited or fun. It is just a great first-prequel-film to the Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson proved with the Lord of the Rings that he was great in casting his characters on screen. With actors as Christopher Lee, Ian McKellen and Cate Blanchett you are just having an amazing cast, maybe the perfect cast. So there was never a need for the fans to worry, Martin Freeman (playing Bilbo) proves that. He does a beautiful job playing the main character. Doing the more emotional scenes saying his heroic lines but also he plays his role on a very funny way, exactly the way Bilbo should be portrayed. Apart from Martin Freeman I think all the dwarfs did an amazing job bringing all these characters to screen. They are not a bunch of dwarfs but they all have their own personalities and they brought that over beautifully , very funny but sometimes also on a very emotional way.<br/><br/>I rate this film 8 out of 10 it was just really great watching and everything seemed to make sense. The fans can be proud of this first prequel film and should be proud of the result. My compliments for the cast and crew!"

","Full Disclosure: I love the LOTR movies. They exemplify what movies can be. They also prove that blockbusters can be Oscar winners. The Hobbit is not that. It doesn't have the same sense of grand scale spread across many different plot threads. To its credit An Unexpected Journey is a much more focused film than the LOTR films. It follows Bilbo Baggins, the future uncle of LOTR's Frodo Baggins. The plot rarely moves away from Bilbo(played with soul by Sherlock's Martin Freeman.) An Unexpected Journey really is Bilbo's Unexpected Journey. Richard Armitage lends a gruff edge to the character of Thorin Oakenshield. Overall, the action scenes are few and far between with none having the same epic scale as LOTR's. The ending is also a bit weak with too much set up for the next film.

Particular in the ending climax there is a scene where burning pine tree nuts are thrown at Wargs(huge- wolf like creatures ridden by Orcs). One of nut is felt like thrown right at audiences' eyes and I almost felt blinded for a second or so, and also felt like the fire's cinder has entered my eyes for real. That experience was terrific. There are other well done scenes such as huge- eagles/flies/butterflies flying right into audience chairs, distance mountain view, fighting of stone giants, etc. But the upsetting thing is that second half of the story is mostly dark and sometimes uncomfortable for 3D viewing."

","The Hobbit, or How perfection is not enough for perfection and form winning over content. To be clear - I enjoyed this movie but I have a number of objections to it which I would like to present here. First I'd like to criticize duration and the fact it was divided into three parts. It is obvious that three-times-Hobbit earns more money than twice-Hobbit, even though I think that the main reason to make three years lasting movie trilogy out of 'one-evening-book' might not be only money. I think Jackson should have quit from this project, keep his hands off it as a director and leave the work to others (I personally would have imagined Guillermo del Toro). Jackson's perfectionism and effort not to disappoint the fans (both of the book and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) seem to have become a sort of scarecrow to him as he decided to grab the book in hands and tell us a whole story from the big screen word by word. That would somehow not be a problem .. if he could fit everything into a single, let's say 3.5 hour long movie. Unfortunately, a tedious entrée and a link between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were not a good start. Although Tolkien's book is filled with a brilliant narration, Jackson dished up several invented and unnecessary scenes, some of which were like a sore thumb (e.g. the one with Radagast). The saddest thing is that scene with Brown wizard corresponds to the humor of the book - but surrounded by too serious scenes creates a incoherent whole. I don't want to be that negative .. Martin Freeman seems to be really excellent choice for the character of Bilbo. In my humble opinion, the best scene of the movie is 'riddle game' with Gollum. Andy Serkis deserves great appreciation and I must say it is a great pity that he did not receive the Oscar already in the original trilogy. Although he was absolutely breathtaking here probably nothing will come of it.. :( Nevertheless Peter Jackson is definitely a maximalist and will probably remain one."

","In 2012, Peter Jackson (with his wife Fran Walsh) returned to Middle-earth. 10 years after the Lord-of-the-Rings films he brought back many of the original actors including McKellen, Weaving, Holm, Lee and Serkis. Elijah ""Frodo Baggins"" Wood is also back for a short scene early on. The main criticism about the Hobbit trilogy early on was that he packed a not-too-long book into another three films instead of just making one film about it. Obviously, the main reason is money as these films would without a doubt be seen by lots of people.<br/><br/>The first film runs for roughly 3 hours (in the extended version) and is thus shorter than all the three ""Lord of the Rings""-movies. ""The Return of the King"" even lasted for over 4 hours. This here is the story of Bilbo Baggins who is played by Martin Freeman. I am not too big of a fan of the critically acclaimed television series ""Sherlock"", but I can't deny Freeman is a good actor, probably better than Wood, although you have to hold in Wood's favor that he was considerably younger than Freeman, pretty much half his age. I really liked the beginning here with the juicy green Shire and all the dwarfs invading Bilbo's home. This story was the strongest in my opinion before the journey actually began. The final scene with the dragon's eye was a good one too and made you curious for the second Hobbit movie. Thorin and Bilbo have a nice final scene together.<br/><br/>Just like with the ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, a large part of the cast consists of fairly unknown actors, such as Richard Armitage in one of the most crucial roles. I guess Jackson wanted to make sure that the center of the film is the journey, the story and not individual performances. This movie builds a lot on the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. There's references everywhere in an attempt to get people who liked the movies back then into theaters again. For example, we also find out how Bilbo got the Ring from Gollum. Visually, it is a feast. The good creatures, but especially the bad ones are so much fun thanks to all the creative work that made them appear the way they finally look. Story-wise I managed to enjoy it as well, even if it is not exactly my favorite genre. If you like fantasy films, the first ""Hobbit"" movie is almost a must-see."

","After 11 years of the major success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, its unforgettable predecessor is also brought to the silver-screen in prequel form, with Peter Jackson reuniting viewers with Holm and Wood in Bag End on Bilbo's one-hundred-and-""eleventieth"" birthday—basically opening THE HOBBIT trilogy in the same spot LORD OF THE RINGS opened. Many characters from RINGS were written into this story, which takes place before RINGS (as already stated) but all the actors mysteriously look a lot older (hmm). Fans of the previous three films may find this installment more childish, and fans of the book will find the adaptation overly ambitious. Still, Freeman is more than charming as a young Bilbo Baggins, the dwarfs share the right amount of cluster that they did in the book, and Jackson brings to life the Riddles In The Dark chapter excellently.

","﻿I had seen the first Hobbit movie around the time it came out and sort of like it. Mind you I have never been a big fan of the franchise so I wasn't waiting for years for this film to be made. My only interest in this one was due to the fact that The Lord of the Rings films were entertaining and impressive. <br/><br/>The film is like The Lord of the Rings in the sense that it is epic, with great set pieces, beautiful landscapes and CGI, interesting characters and a decent screenplay. As the movie started I realized it was basically about money, power and also revenge. I honestly did not expect to see something so trivial in these movies. I was maybe too young when the others came out to see these things but I watched The Hobbit with grown up eyes and enjoyed.<br/><br/>The extremely long cast list scared me. I was afraid the film would be overcrowded and hard to follow but it's not. Of course, I know there are thirteen Dwarfs but I know the name of one - Thorin - and can describe at least two. As for the returning cast, it's great that they're in the movie because at least you have characters you care about so that you don't have to ""waste"" your time with the others whose names pretty much sound the same.<br/><br/>Freeman owns Bilbo, he's likable and fun to watch. I did not think for a second about Ian Holm who played an older version of Bilbo Baggins and is also in the film. Thorin (Armitage) was annoying, bad-ass but still annoying. He stood out because he was getting on my nerves. Gandalf was much more proactive and bad-ass in this movie, I really liked it. Gollum (Andy Serkis) stole the movie, he's more dangerous and creepy<br/><br/>In conclusion, An Unexpected Journey is entertaining but it is stretched. Some scene could have cut short. It starts really slowly but when the action takes off, it really does. The only thing I miss and hope to see in the other movies - because I have not watched them yet - is the comedic, funny scenes The Lord of the Rings movies had. The Hobbit may not be as dark and gritty but it's not as funny as the previous movies, or maybe I grew up.<br/><br/>So the Hobbit I know it's been years since it came out but we can spark up a conversation about the movie because we'll get to all of them soon.

","Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit from the peaceful Shire. One day, twelve dwarfs and a wizard called Gandalf show up at his door and almost before he knows it he's off on a dangerous quest to steal some gold from a dragon who lives under a mountain ...<br/><br/>This beautiful adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic children's adventure story, made by the same team as the epic The Lord Of The Rings movies from eleven years earlier, is just as visually dazzling, lovingly crafted and wildly imaginative as its grand predecessors. It even begins with a prologue set during the opening of the previous films, featuring Holm and Wood as Bilbo and Frodo, which looks as fresh as if it were shot during the originals. Jackson steps back into the world of Middle-earth with a sure hand, maintaining just the right balance of consistency and atmosphere, combined with the telling of a very different and more intimate story. The Hobbit is a simpler, more whimsical tale, with just one plot thread, far fewer characters and more emphasis on humour, and the cast are all excellent. Freeman captures Bilbo's innate fussiness and irritability, and the conflict between this and his desire to go adventuring, while the actors playing the dwarfs manage the tricky task of making their characters distinct and memorable. McKellen is the key link to the previous adventures and steps back into the frame with aplomb, while Serkis as usual steals the movie as Gollum in the classic Riddles In The Dark sequence. By using all the key technicians again - especially composer Howard Shore, cameraman Andrew Lesnie, and effects/makeup/costumes/props designer Richard Taylor - the movie has quality and continuity assured, and is fun, fresh, dramatic and exciting from start to finish. I'm afraid I must however comment on something fundamental which bothers me - the tone. In my view the film tries very hard to be as similar as possible to The Lord Of The Rings, and I'd guess this was at the insistence of the financiers. It does this several ways; by simply being long (the novel of The Hobbit is about a quarter of the length of The Lord Of The Rings), by constructing expansive sequences from nothing (for example, the Rock Giants scene is a lengthy and expensive looking section in the film but a throwaway sentence in the book), by creating deliberate links (such as the meeting with Saruman and Galadriel, which is a fabrication for the movie), and, worst of all, by altering the fabric of the plot in unjustifiable ways. The pale orc antagonist character, Azog, and the revenge plot which accompanies him, is complete invention, most likely to justify lengthy and bloody action sequences which play no part in the novel. This is odd for a movie which does such a good job of faithfully creating Tolkien's world - for example, the opening dinner scene is a near perfect recreation of the book's opening chapter. Bilbo doesn't rescue Thorin at any point in the novel and they don't have any emotional reconciliations either. I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking the story of The Hobbit could easily be told in one solid two-hour movie, and that all of the expensive embellishment is perhaps chiefly to ensure patrons purchase three tickets. I don't want to be cynical or judgemental though - whatever the movie's aims or production history, it is exquisitely made, fantastic entertainment, and a definitive version of one of the most influential adventure stories ever written."

Tolkien (How did Sauron come back? How did Bilbo find the one ring?). However, the film contains some inconsistencies that are annoying after a short time.. I'll give the famous example of Legolas, a character coming from the trilogy who's coming back again although he's not mentioned in the Hobbit's book.<br/><br/>To conclude, I recommend the film to the fans of the Trilogy, but experts of the Middle-Earth who are looking on every details could be disappointed."

As the nature of the material on which it is based is more light-hearted, it was never going to rival the rings trilogy in terms of sheer grandness, but if anything this looks even more fantastic and wonderful, if a little too computer based.

"randallcameron","6","0","2","12 May 2014"," How did you find your steak? Parts of it were excellent...
","We were disappointed.<br/><br/>Sound and visuals were stunning as expected. However, there was too much action, a lot of it irrelevant or unbelievable by the standards of the Middle Earth franchise, and not enough character development.<br/><br/>The additions from LOTR supplements were tolerable, and might explain things to a newbie. At least they fit the intent of the story. The added ""Azog hunts Thorin"" backstory was a distraction that made this more action movie than drama. The numerous long falls, or stuff falling on people without somehow killing them were just ridiculous, in a way that clueless trolls debating how to eat dwarfs were not.<br/><br/>We were OK with the lighter mood than LOTR, which mirrors the books. Our kids watched the Hobbit, but are not quite ready for the more believable violence and terror of LOTR.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, this much simpler story does not demand a nine hour movie. The efforts to expand it appear purely commercial, effectively to capitalize on the phenomenal success of LOTR. As the mixed reviews here show, this might backfire unless the last installment is fantastic.<br/><br/>Part of our disappointment is that Jackson and Boyens really captured the spirit of LOTR well, particularly in Fellowship and Return of the King. A little more restraint here, with an eye to simply telling the story well without a lot of added Hollywood-ey crap would have been welcome."

What I do like about this movie is that they made Bilbo the way he is supposed to be portrayed.

"BrickNash","7","0","1","28 April 2014"," Highly enjoyable fantasy adventure with glaring cosmetic flaws and inaccuracies to source
","Having just watched this film again since seeing it on it's cinematic release I felt my opinion of it solidify.<br/><br/>Let's get it out of the way, it's not as good as any of the Lord Of The Rings Films, nor is it a particularly faithful adaptation of the wonderful book which I read as a child but as a fantasy film it's fairly decent.<br/><br/>The acting is all top notch and the new dwarven music is superb and has a really enchanting melody. The film doesn't move super fast but it's OK and keeps the attention fine.<br/><br/>Now to the flaws, of which there are a few and they mainly reside in the cosmetics.<br/><br/>For a start the film relies far too much on CGI. This is fine for grand settings and adding in the odd ruin here and there on a bare hilltop but not for actual characters. In LOTR, the orcs were men in suits and makeup and looked tangible, gritty and real. Almost all the goblins and such are computer generated and unfortunately it shows. All this,combined with some rather bizarre colour schemes, very much gives the film a Phantom menace/Time Burton's Alice In Wonderland feel and that is never a good thing.<br/><br/>Secondly the dwarven makeup is absolutely terrible. They honestly look like they are from a budget pantomime and not a massive fantasy film. To reference LOTR again, the dwarfs were tough and gruff with no frills and not much colour. Here they look like they have stepped straight out of Ridely Scott's Legend (A great film but not what we want here!).<br/><br/>Admittedly in the cinema the 48fps really made the make up obvious and in the home it's lessened some but the braided beards and obviously fake noses really kill the feel. Another issue is that some of the dwarfs don't even look like dwarfs, they look more like men and some are even quite pretty.<br/><br/>These flaws do nothing to capture the feel set in either the book, the LOTR films or fantasy in general and it's a shame that issues so cheap looking were allowed to slip through the net.<br/><br/>Cosmetics aside the film is highly enjoyable and it is a nice film to have as an addition if you are on a LOTR binge.<br/><br/>I'd have to give this film 2 ratings for sake of source respect.<br/><br/>As a film adaptation of a beautiful children's book, it's about a 3 or 4 out of 10 I'm afraid.<br/><br/>As a fantasy film and expansion of a known universe in film it's a solid 7. Highly watchable and enjoyable adventure with only some glaring cosmetic flaws letting it down."
"ihemu","8","0","2","1 March 2014"," Another nail biting movie from Peter Jackson
","Let's start with why i've given 8 out of 10 for this movie. First of all, after seeing Lord of the Rings i've wondered how the ring came to Bilbo baggins? I don't know about anyone who feels the same as me. The question is answered in this movie. From ""Return of the king"" we saw that how smeagol found the ring and became Gollum. In this movie we saw how Bilbo finds the Ring. That means it is a prequel of The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The story line is pretty simple. Once upon a time in middle-earth there was a mountain where the Dwarf's lived known as the Lonely Mountain. They are very much well established with the help of gold. Once a dragon named Smaug swept away the Dwarvish kingdom and made them homeless. Smaug sleeps upon the vast treasure. The grandson of the king named Thorin wants to regain their pride and treasure. Gandalf the wizard wants to help and joins with them.<br/><br/>There are 13 dwarf's gathered in Bilbo's house who want's to fight against all odds to help Thorin to regain their homeland. They all then stared journey towards the wild to regain. But unfortunately Azog the orc and Goblins became their obstacle. They fought against them and came near to the Lonely mountain. On this odd journey Bilbo baggins found the Ring and Gollum.<br/><br/>On my point of view, nothing special was used on movie. The graphics is normal. But the orcs, goblins and gollum is more realistic then from the Lord of the Rings. Waiting for the HD print of the desolation of the smaug."

","This is a very good movie all things considered equally but it suffers obviously because it is following the hugely successful and greatest- trilogy-of-all-time trilogy of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. It's apparent that nothing could live up to such high expectations as following that but Jackson does a great job, as do the cast and everyone in the crew especially the make-up, wardrobe and special effects people, who deserve more credit.<br/><br/>If this movie suffers anywhere it's the simple fact that the studio wants to milk the series for all it's worth so they have spread out the story to cover three full length (2 plus hours long) movies. The Hobbit of course is a much lighter book that LOTR so that is not an easy thing to do without spreading the story a little thin, but Jackson does a great job taking his time, keeping a good pacing and filling in the movie with other side stories, both from other Tolkien books and made up specifically for this film."

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey review<br/><br/>The Hobbit is an fantasy film made in 2012, it is directed by Peter Jackson. Its written by Peter Jackson and his long term co-writers: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro, who originally was chosen to direct the film until he resigned from the project in 2010. This film is only the first of a three part series of films about the book which was wrote in 1937 by J.R.Tolkien, the second film will be called 'The Desolation of Smaug' and following that will be 'There and Back Again'. The follow ups are set to be released in 2013 and 2014. It premiered in New Zealand on the 28th of November and was released all over the world on the 13th December 2012. The movie is set sixty years before 'the Lord of the Rings', the story is about the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, not Morgan) who is hired by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to go with thirteen dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage). The dwarfs, the wizard and the hobbit go on a adventurous quest across Middle Earth, from Bilbo's home in the Shire to Thorin's home of Erebor. Thorin is the rightful king of Erebor but the kingdom was burned to a crisp by Smaug the dragon, which led them into a battle with elves in which his father and grandfather died. Thorin wants to reclaim Erebor back to his family, Smaug stands in the way but first they must get to the lonely mountain, which is a massive challenge anyway. I'll be honest, don't shun me, I can't remember when I last watched Lord of the Rings and I can't remember the plot which is why I was a bit sceptical on whether I would understand the plot, the characters, etc. So there I sat, in between snacking film-viewers in my comfortable seat which led me to the question ""would I fall asleep? And if I did how would I manage to review it?"" I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't, well I couldn't could I? When the movie started I loved it, the opening battle was epic, trolls, dwarfs, giants, fire, earth, water, blood, guts, tears and beards...everything! More specifically everything you expect from the Lord of the Rings. After that scene, the tempo slowed down as you would expect when you're describing a peaceful hobbit's life, things became quite boring until Gandalf and his crew showed up which brought some life back into the film. But it didn't really kick in until they all set off on their journey, from then on its madness, nothing is left uncovered even a nature loving wizard (I know right!?) Then about three fifths of the way through most of the viewers-including me- became a bit restless, after all its a massively long film! Which is probably normal for avid Lord of the Rings fanatics, but not for the average viewer, that would be my biggest criticism. However, the film requires you're attention constantly otherwise you won't fully understand the plot for the rest of the film, this would be impossible to keep your focus fully on a movie for nearly three hours normally but the breath-taking graphics and destinations make it easier, honestly they're awesome the only better graphics I've seen are the ones on 'the Amazing Spider-Man'. They're the best part about the movie because everything requires a stunning view and the creatures there need putting together piece by piece on computer and when you think about the attention to detail on each character it's scary how hard it would be to make. Well done to everyone who worked on The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, it was good even to those who weren't familiar with Lord of the Rings. And may I just add ""thhheee preeeeeecccious!"" RATING 7.9/10<br/><br/>Best parts: First battle Riddles with Golumn (that should seriously be a game-show!) Bilbo Baggins being accepted"

The third movie comes out soon which is an important fact that I will bring up again at the end of this review. Stop reading here if you don't want to know what happens in the movie.<br/><br/>Like most if not all Tolkien books the storyline revolves around a journey and the movie is worth seeing just for the fantastic scenery and special effects. The main characters travel through normal woods, open plains, dark and twisted woods, wood elves kingdom, Rocky Mountain terrain, a town surrounded by water, and a huge underground dwarf kingdom. There is plenty to see and re watch visually and right now I am thinking this would be a great movie to view in my man cave.<br/><br/>I also very much enjoyed seeing Legolis engage in his own special version of pin the arrow into the orc. That elf is one bad dude and his moves would put a martial artist or superhero to shame. Taurial is also just about as fun to watch as she tends to be more up close and person in combat.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the movie and others in the theater seemed to agree is that the movie ended without a real ending. Yes, Smaug, the dragon awakes, runs amock, breaths fire at Bilbo and the dwarfs but at the end he flies away to attack the town. You have to wait until the next movie to see what happens to Smaug and the town.<br/><br/>I also warn you to eat before going to the movie because at 161 minutes I feel the movie ran too long for my liking.<br/><br/>Overall I would rate Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug a solid B or 8.0 for it's great visuals and entertaining combat but downgrade it for its lack of character development, no real ending, and inability to keep my from looking at my watch several times due to its length and slowly moving storyline.

Aside from the Grey Wizard Gandalf, the rest of the characters going on the titular ""Unexpected Journey"" are actually Dwarfs. The journey was made to help the Dwarf warrior Thorin recover the lost Dwarf Kingdom from under the control of the dragon Smaug (that is the name in the sequel's title). <br/><br/>On this journey, they will encounter Goblins and Orcs who will imperil them in various spectacular elaborately-executed, yet obviously computer generated battles scenarios. Every member of the quest group seemed to have charmed lives the way they escape even the most precarious and deadly situations. These action scenes were fun to watch in their video-game-like presentations, though they went on a tad too long.<br/><br/>There will also be quiet scenes, and these were actually more effective. Gandalf will have an audience of Lady Galadriel in Riverdell. And in the best part of the film, Bilbo will encounter Gollum, and we will witness how the Hobbit gains possession of Gollum's ""preciousssss"" Ring. This was THE big moment of the whole film though it only comes after the second hour already, when you may already be zoned off since nothing of any big significance happened before this iconic scene.<br/><br/>This first film really just prepared us for this second film when they will actually encounter Smaug. OK, now I am ready to watch Part II."
"dragonchild-864-46529","9","0","2","11 December 2013"," Review The Hobbit: Positive vs Negative
","I would first like to say that I am a huge fan of LOTR, but this does not mean that I can't be critically.<br/><br/>I have given this movie an 7.3 out of 10 because,<br/><br/>Positive: I love the wonderful landscapes, they give a miraculous appearance on the movie. They ship a magical atmosphere that really touch you. The landscapes really bring you back to the magic of the LOTR. That is where Peter Jackson is good at. He creates this marvelous world that make's the movie looks fantastic, for the shot of the nature i love his choice for the HFR(48fps). They let it become real and it works amazingly impressive.<br/><br/>The shot of Rivendell were much more exuberant than in the LOTR, that was also an improvement. The Gollum scene was even better than in the LOTR, he looked even more realistic than the old one. I want to thank Andy Serkis for his impressive acting work. He did an incredible job there. Peter Jackson did a good casting job. The role of Bilbo and Gandalf were played flawless by Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen . I like the more lightly feeling above the movie, it isn't as dark but it doesn't need to be. It got its benefits too.<br/><br/>Negative: The story was too long to be good or contradicted too short to be good.<br/><br/>Why too long?: The introduction was not bad but also not impressive. I liked the humor that was introduced there but the scene's took too long. It kept like forever before the movie really starts. You don't got enough action in the first movie to satisfy the action fan of the movie. Who were waiting the hole movie for the stereotype fight scenes. The fans of the books were not pleased with the adaptation on the book, so peter couldn't please them either. Because of the long intro you were waiting the hole movie for a story that would never come. <br/><br/>Why too short?: For the real LOTR fans and the value seekers was the movie to short. The film was too short to dig out every single character in the film. So there wasn't much draft in the characters and you don't got those intensive conversations between the characters in the movie. You don't got a good ending on the movie it was too early for a cliff hanger. So you didn't really got the intention that you must see the next movie. What you did had was the feeling that you need to know more, but the ending wasn't spectacular. I also missed some wide shot of Middle-earth and more shots of the landscapes.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed in the look of the ""new"" Orks. They were less impressive than the old one, they were much more computer generated than the old ones. Because of that the magic touch was a bit lost. Peter wanted to be different from his LOTR movies but because of that it was often more disappointing than it was innovating. The 48fps did a bit of the magical feeling go lost. But it also has got its benefits.<br/><br/>Finely, it didn't match the magnificence of the original LOTR but it wasn't bad. The magic touch wasn't optimal. The CG was impressive but not always in the right time, the landscapes were astonishing. But the film was like butter spread over too much bread. Not as fluent as the LOTR but after all it was a wonderful movie with great possibility to improve further in the trilogy ."
"Magpie_Matt","9","0","3","10 December 2013"," Does reading the book make you prefer the films?
","When the Harry Potter films first came out I never read any of the books, to be truthful I didn't read any books, but my partner was a massive Harry Potter geek and was slowly more and more disappointed by the film adaptations of the books. She still loved the films wholesomely but craved for the films to impart more details and more depth in some of the later larger books. When I heard they were making the Hobbit (the first book I have ever read with such intrigue and joy that it made me take up reading a whole lot more) I was excited to see that it was going to be a trilogy. Although the book may be a little thin for 9 hours worth of filming, there is certainly enough details and enough characteristics in which they can make more than a standard 2 hour feature film. I wasn't disappointed with the first film's length or depth of characters or attention to detail, in fact they even added more that the books worth in Radagast (who was only mentioned in Hobbit). I also liked the beginning with a cameo of Frodo and Old Bilbo, and the inclusion of Saruman and Galadriel at Rivendale. This film had all that was needed to be a perfect 10 Blockbuster and genuinely bring the world I had imagined by reading the book to life, however they failed by making stupid decision to bring a bit more ""humour"" to the film where it was not needed. The Great Goblin under the mountain was far too camp to be a Goblin.....Goblins are hate-filled putrid beings that live in darkness and squalor.....they don't prance around singing show tunes! there were a few other little ""comedic"" additions to which I never found in the book, but they were minuscule to the abomination of the goblin king! I hope they keep true to the book in the rest of the films, and don't make it too fairytale-esque!"

","Finallya worthy rendition of, 'The Hobbit."" I could actually sit down, watch the movie and follow it from beginning to end. What a relief. Unlike, ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"", this was an easy to follow story, with enough humor injected to keep the flow almost seamless. The directing was brilliant, I laughed, I cried, I laughed (and got up to go to the bathroom) – brilliant. The actingriveting. Like a laser beam, my attention was focused on each character portrayal for the entire movie (with the exception of the time spent in the bathroom.) Would I call this movie flawless? Well let's say if one actually sat down and read, ""The Hobbit"", each person would walk away with a different idea of what Tolkien was describing. For me, I felt this was about as close as one could get. And the same would apply for those who took the time actually reading the subsequent trilogy. I was one of those who did sit and read the books and personally feel this was better put together than, ""The Lord of The Rings"", Trilogy. This was definitely a lot of fun to watch."
"connork97","8","0","4","5 December 2013"," I enjoyed this film
","When I watch a Peter Jackson film, I tend to find them much better when in a theatre. The LOTR trilogy and King Kong were both great epic's. The large beautiful landscape, the massive battles with dinosaurs, giant bats and orcs riding overwhelmingly huge elephants. These are tails fit for the big screen. I watched The Hobbit in a theatre, and I felt the same. It had huge landscapes, and creatures that are only fit for fantasy, and, in certain scenes it delivered that powerful emotional dialogue, combined with an awe inspiring backdrop. That which we seen in Sam's speech on the side of mount doom in the Return of the King, and when Ann Darrow sleeps in Kongs hand while the sun sets over skull islands horizon. It seems to take all of the intense energy, and horrifying reality's, slows it down, and crafts it into a truly beautiful scene. I certainly felt this majestic feeling in some scenes of The Hobbit.<br/><br/>Truth be told, this is the perfect film for an 10 year old kid, it is much less dark then the Fellowship and is much more of a humorous, light hearted adventure tail, which is what The Hobbit is. Tolkien originally wrote this story for young readers, before he built it into the Lord of the Rings. Saying that, I do feel as though this film trilogy will darken,and become bigger then what is seen here. It kinda feels like how Harry Potter starts off, light with charm full character's, and then it matures, as do the characters.It will be interesting to see were Peter takes Tolkien's great story, as it always is."
"poe426","8","0","2","4 December 2013"," Overall, not bad...
","THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is frankly one of the better entries in this series- for the most part. However... when our heroes fall afoul of the goblins, the computers take over and we're once again dashing headlong up and down a virtual roller-coaster ride that almost undoes all that's been carefully established prior to this. There's absolutely no suspense- much less drama- when it comes to the gravity-defying cgi. Better to have given us a handful of PRACTICAL effects and a suspenseful hunt through darkened caverns than what we see here. And it's bad enough that the cgi are employed so heavily in the chase- but then they're used in the follow-up scene as well, so that we end up with two back-to-back video sequences that lack- again- any real suspense or any drama at all. Still, I'm giving the movie an 8 out of 10 because the scenes leading up to the cartoon parts are good."

Breathtaking scenes, great acting, beautiful music, and technology! The story is mixture of comedy, action, adventure, sorrow, fear, bravery, wisdom, friendship and teamwork. That's what I love about this epic movie. When you watch it, you feel it, you live it. Middle-Earth was never better represented.

"AsifZamir","10","0","5","28 November 2013"," The same thing happened to me, just kidding.
","Okay so by now you've watched Lord of the Rings, probably more than once.<br/><br/>This movie is adapted from the novel and is about a race of small people called Hobbit's and brings in wizards, trolls and dragons and much more. It is a journey of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit that has no desire for adventures in the beginning. Only trouble is his mother was of different blood and in that blood line stem adventures. Gandalf the wizard never gave up on Bilbo on a mythical quest to kill a dragon. Bilbo was to be the dragon slayer, harmless little Bilbo who was quite comfortable in his life that he lived. The movie The Hobbit consists of three different movies. The first one is An Unexpected Journey released in 2012, the second one is The Desolation of Smaug (2103) and the third; There and Back Again (2014) and I believe this is all a prequel series to the Lord of the Rings. The quest is embarked on by Bilbo, Gandalf and thirteen dwarfs and they form a fellowship and Bilbo experiences a whole new life and adventures untold. The dwarfs are on a quest to regain their underground home from the dragon who looted their plunder.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a classic film that brings fantasy and adventure in as well as the importance of friendship and courage and honour. This is a movie that you don't want miss out on if you are in the love of old lore and mythical adventures. I watched this movie after a hard day of work, so at first I was a bit bored, but after the first hour it really picks up well! - Asif Zamir"

","I absolutely loved it! I can't get over the movie :3 I thought it was awesome! It might be a bit unrealistic sometimes, but it is Tolkien and Peter Jackson we are talking about! Nothing is too unrealistic for these guys and in this case it only makes the movie more awesome. More extreme. More majestic! I've watched this movie over and over, I know every single line out of my head and I still want to watch it again! Acting was awesome! The cast was fantastic! You could see that the actors had become a real family, a brotherhood, that they spend so many years together, you can see it in the movie. I also really liked the movie because they didn't use the big, dramatic, Hollywood actors (Ian doesn't count, he's the only one who can play Gandalf. There is no other!). The actors might not stand in the top 10, but they were still the best cast for this project. They all played their part in a way that had me synchronized with the movie If I have to be honest then I have to say that the first trailer was boring, but the movie is the complete opposite!"
"MLDinTN","7","0","3","19 November 2013"," entertaining adventure but was a little too long
","This movie was pretty good but could have been shorter. And I wouldn't recommend seeing any the next film in theaters because you know it will be like this one with no ending. You should wait till the third one comes out so you can watch it all back to back. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this because I don't like it when movies end like this, set up for the next one with no ending.<br/><br/>Any ways, the special effects were good with trolls and goblins, but the rock giants served little purpose. Also, the beginning could have been sped up when they were in Bilbo's house waiting to start the adventure. I wonder why Gandalf couldn't conger a spell when they were stuck in the burning tree, how come he never uses more magic. My favorite part was Bilbo and Gollum during the riddle challenge.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching, but I would wait till all 3 films are out so you don't get stuck with no ending."
"Tss5078","7","0","3","17 November 2013"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","Going into The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I knew that it was a tale originally written for children, but the Lord of The Rings trilogy was so well done, that I fully expected the first Hobbit movie to be just as masterful. It was a pretty good film, however it didn't have the luster that Lord of The Rings had. The trilogy was magical, it's the reason people go to the movies, but the Hobbit, seemed to be playing off the fame of the Lord of The Rings and at times was directionless. For those who don't know the story, it starts to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his original journey with Gandalf. In the Lord of The Rings, they go on this impossible journey in order to save Middle Earth, but here, the journey is about saving the dwarfs gold from a dragon. It really doesn't have the intensity or the urgency require to make a film like this work. Nothing had changed for over two hundred years, but all of a sudden, now is the time to stop the dragon, why? The film was not bad, but it doesn't come off as this great adventure and that could have something to do with the childish elements. This is a PG-13 film with fighting and beheadings, yet it's also a film with singing dwarfs, drunk gnomes, and a wizard with Alzheimer who is covered in bird crap. I feel these things really hurt the film. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and finally seemed to be showing his age. McKellen is tired and slow in this film, Gandalf is not the same great warrior. Finally, this film is different because we know it's a prequel. Even if you didn't read the book, you know who lives and who dies, taking a major play away from the screenwriters. Overall the Hobbit is somewhat entertaining, but it's not The Lord of The Rings. It's directionless at times, lacks the urgency needed for an epic, and has a cast that really doesn't excite. I was hoping for a lot, but all I got was a little. The only thing I can do now is try and forget about it as I wait for the next film with anticipation."

"halliejopo","9","0","2","9 November 2013"," A warm welcome back to Middle Earth
","Peter Jackson did such an utterly fantastic job on the Lord of the Rings trilogy that the Hobbit was bound to great. The Lord of the Rings movies are modern classics, so the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey had a lot to live up to. Overall, I feel as though the Hobbit met those expectations.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Hobbit did not receive the critical rave that the Lord of the Rings did. Many critics (and fans) criticized the Hobbit's use of 48 fps and its light and humorous tone. I disagree with both of these claims.<br/><br/>1. The critics should not have reviewed the Hobbit based on its use of 48 fps. Peter Jackson simply wanted to experiment with this new film form to see the reaction. Obviously, the reaction to 48 fps was not a positive one. But the frame rate of the movie should not be taken into account when reviewing it. It holds no significance in the movie's quality.<br/><br/>2. The light and humorous tone was absolutely intentional, but for a reason that many people did not understand. Many compared the Hobbit to the Star Wars prequels, saying that both had a lighter tone to accommodate children and the younger generation. This claim is false. The Hobbit had a lighter tone than the Lord of the Rings had because it takes place before the rise of Mordor and the discovery of the ring, so the world is much more peaceful and happy. Most likely, an Unexpected Journey will be followed by a much darker Desolation of Smaug.<br/><br/>The Hobbit did a fantastic job at being its own movie while also paying homage to the Lord of the Rings. I saw this film twice in theaters, and both times the audience was enthralled by the reappearance of characters and references to the original trilogy.<br/><br/>The actors were all perfectly cast, no doubt about it. Ian McKellan was Gandalf in the flesh (as he was before), it was wonderful to see Andy Serkis back as Gollum/Smeagol, and Richard Armitage had great presence as Thorin, but the actor that truly impressed me was Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Having read the Hobbit, Martin Freeman IS Bilbo. The rest of the cast was also charming.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hobbit is fantastic. It may not be considered a modern classic like its predecessors, but it still deserves recognition as a great fantasy film."
"JamesMitchell451","9","0","3","13 August 2013"," The Hobbit manages to successfully avoid the traps that the Star Wars prequels fell into
","Peter Jackson's The Lord Of The Rings trilogy is my second favorite trilogy ever (Sorry guys, but in my book Nolan's Batman is still number 1), so naturally I was skeptical when I heard that they were making The Hobbit into a trilogy. But I have to say that while An Unexpected Journey isn't even in the same ballpark as the LOTR trilogy, it is still really kickass. The story is one of the stronger points of An Unexpected Journey. It is well told and intense. Since they are turning this into a trilogy, some central plot points are pulled out of someone's ass. Surprisingly, this didn't annoy me at all and these points are really well integrated into the key central story. But I hate the way the film ends, like literally it just ""Ends"". Nevertheless, I'm intrigued to see where the story goes. It helps that this script is so well written and contains great dialogue. The visuals are also incredible. Due to the higher frame rate, there is so much stuff going on on screen. While it does feel a bit jarring at first, there came a point where I got used to it. The film is true eye candy, especially during the awesome action scenes that deliver edge-of-your-seat thrills. There is not a single effect that doesn't look brilliant, these are some of the most incredible visuals of the decade. What I personally like the most about An Unexpected Journey is the acting. Everyone in the cast naturally gives Oscar-worthy performances, but once again the one who steals the show is Andy Serkis, who returns as Gollum. Gollum not only looks better detailed, but he is given much better material to work with here despite him being on screen for only like 20 minutes. But what a glorious 20 minutes it is, these twenty minutes are better than any of the scenes containing Gollum in the trilogy. You truly feel sorry for him and see the helpless side of him, cause remember: He is a slave to the ring, and it is the only thing he cares about anymore. Naturally, you know what happens, but it is still heartbreaking. Why wasn't Andy Serkis given an Oscar for his performance here?! I don't understand why critics are being so stupid when it comes to rating this film. It deserves a far higher score on Rotten Tomatoes than it currently has. This is a truly great film and a great beginning to what will surely be an epic trilogy."

This is what one can call an ""Adventure packed film"". From beginning till end the viewer is kept entertained and engaged by this spectacular wonder.Peter Jackson does it again and manifests Tolkien's magical words onto the silver screen as faithfully as he did his first 3 times. As prequel to THE ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" it does justice to itself and its predecessors.<br/><br/>The stellar cast is aptly tailored to suite the roles. Martin Freeman presents a beautiful depiction of Bilbo Baggins in his youth and Richard Armitage provides a regal and apt personification of the dwarf prince. We still get to enjoy a lot of Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Gandalf the Gray is even more spectacular in this film than before.<br/><br/>The Music in the film is indeed in need of special mention and appreciation. Most excellent,is the only way one can define this music which provide unbelievable immersion into the plot and the situation of the movie. Thank You Howard Shore.<br/><br/>The SFX in this movie is amazing to say the least it is certainly better or at least as good as that used in its predecessors. All in all a most excellent film noteworthy for its magnificent story ,engaging plot, exquisite dialogue and enchanting,enthralling music."
"mhlong","8","0","2","7 August 2013"," Good Views, and Characterizations, Typical Jacksonesque Storyline
","I pretty much have the entire story in memory, as it was the first of Tolkien's stories that I read,and enjoying it immensely, I've reread it numerous times. I'm also old enough to know that any movie adaptation is very unlikely to follow the original to the letter, so I was not expecting a word for word retelling. I also know that Peter Jackson likes to take wide liberties with original story lines (for what reason I'm not sure, I guess to please himself). Anyway, I saw the movie over the Christmas holidays in 3D IMAX but was not able to see it in 48fps to see if that was interesting. I enjoyed the story being told, but I was totally unimpressed by both the 3D and IMAX. Neither added a thing to the story. I was in the exact center about 7 rows up from the side to side aisle (about 15 rows back from the screen) and my glasses pretty much filled in from both sides. Some 3D was interesting but the 10 or 15 truly 3D moments were not effective in the least. Nor was the IMAX. Big screen, yes, effective, no. <br/><br/>Now the story. I thought the dwarfs that were allowed speaking lines were well portrayed, but Bomber for instance was just 'there'. We needed to meet them all, not just see the 'fat' one, for example. Only about 5 got good parts, Fili and Kili our Legolas stand-ins, Thorin, the old geezer, and maybe one or two others. Thorin is just a little too dignified for me. The original story was they were going to break into the dragon's lair and steal something little!!! (at best, the Arkenstone, just to show that they could do it). In this version, 13 dwarfs are going to reclaim the entire kingdom where before the dragon wiped out a huge dwarven army, but this time they have a burglar with them. Yeah. Sorry, doesn't hold up. The book Thorin was pretty much a jerk throughout, and at almost the end (spoiler) he was a real jerk. It's going to be hard expecting him to turn into one, as he's the Aragorn stand-in for the brooding, intense, but basically decent king without a throne. <br/><br/>I didn't mind Radagast tho he was made to look extremely foolish way too much (I could have done without the eyes crossing every other minute, and now that I think about it, his riding around on that rabbit sled reminds me of one of the early characters in Neverending Story, the overly dressed little person on his racing snail, just as silly looking), Saruman was almost in his late LOTR mode which means for the next 60 Middle-earth years, he was going to be a continual party-pooper (almost like he knew the Ring would be available very soon - nobody did at that moment. Maybe he already had the palantir and the 'necromancer' was using him already – not in the real story, but you know PJ). <br/><br/>The mini-White Council was OK and I thought Elrond was portrayed really well. The goblin King was as hideous as the original story made him out. Gollum was good, the continuing villain of Azog/Bolg was one of Jackson's unneeded characters, as the wild wolves would have been more than enough. The trolls were actually about what I expected, tho Bilbo's burglarizing was played down, and Gandalf's power was played up a little too much. The stone giants were well done if just a little over done, a few minutes less would have been just fine. Galadriel was OK. Gandalf was just like I expected. And Martin Freeman as Bilbo, I thought did a decent job of slowly moving from prim home-bodied Hobbit, to give more than a glimmer that he could think on his own. He just didn't start out as home-dwelling as the book Bilbo did, so his 'growth was a little more than I was expecting but it was fine although I'm not sure I can see Ian Holm coming out of that portrayal. At least this Bilbo wasn't portrayed as some 16 year old. <br/><br/>I wish more elves had been singing, Rivendell should have been still awash in elves at this time, but since it wasn't, it's going to be hard to have Elrond/them show up in the last act as some kind of cavalry (spoiler, he didn't in the book, but I expect him to because Jackson likes heavy handed presaging and Elrond on horseback looked dashing) . Speaking of which, the woodland King on his stag was sort of silly looking as was the extreme vegan diet of the elves. The dwarfs would have known about it and not acted surprised at lettuce leaves on the plate if it were true, (and you'd think the Elves as hosts would know the dietary desires of the dwarfs, but that's Jackson again) There are any number of text references to elves having feasts that include meat at times, and there would be a load of bread.<br/><br/>So, okay, I liked the movie as I thought the sets especially did a good job portraying the countryside between Bilbo's home and the other side of the Misty Mountains. The characterizations if not 'factual' were at least interesting, and the story line is staying as close as I had hoped. I'll be awaiting part 2, especially to see Orlando Bloom's role. I'd be more interested to see Strider the Ranger wander into a scene or two and then disappear. At least that would make just as much sense."

"brando647","8","0","2","13 July 2013"," The First HOBBIT Film is...Alright, I Guess...
","Ugh, there is just so much about Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth that I wish had gone better. My expectations were high for the first HOBBIT movie, but I did my best to keep them in check. The original LORD OF THE RINGS films were just fantastic and rank high amongst my all-time favorite film series. I knew the new film would have a hard time living up to the quality of the originals, but I'd assumed it would come close. I mean, it is Peter Jacksonthe original man who brought Middle Earth to the big screen more than successfully three times already. I was mostly right, but THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY has some problems that just can't see past. For those unfamiliar with the J.R.R. Tolkien novel, it follows the adventure of Bilbo Baggins (now Martin Freeman) as he finds his life turned upside down at the arrival of Gandalf (Ian McKellen, returning) to his home in Bag End. Gandalf requests that the hobbit join him on quest across distant lands with a band of dwarfs to reclaim their home in the Lonely Mountain. The band of thirteen dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), were long ago driven from their mighty kingdom by the dragon Smaug. The time has arrived when Thorin will lead his band, with the aid of Gandalf, back to the mountain to reclaim their land and riches. Bilbo has been elected as their burglar, as a dragon-infested mountain might require a bit of stealth. But Bilbo might be in over his head...<br/><br/>I'll start by admitting that I did enjoy AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY. Mostly. It doesn't quite come near the level of its predecessors but all of the ingredients are there. This is obviously a Peter Jackson film, as the scope is immense. The New Zealand landscapes remain a perfect stand-in for the various aspects of Middle Earth, and each scene is just as gorgeous as you'd expect from a movie in this series. I'm not surprised the movie was nominated for as many production design, costuming, and art design awards as it was. This is one element of the series that hasn't diminished, as AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is gorgeous. I was also immensely happy with the casting of the film. We have a handful of returning cast who fall right back into their roles as if they'd never left: McKellen (Gandalf), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), and of course Andy Serkis (Gollum) with brief cameos from Ian Holm and Elijah Wood to set up the context of the tale. From there we have a series of new arrivals, primarily our band of dwarfs. Richard Armitage is strong as Thorin but lacks any of the humility Viggo Mortensen brought to the character of Aragorn in the original trilogy. Thorin is stern and callous throughout the film, scarcely cracking a good-natured smile the entire time. I get that he's supposed to be our angst- riddled hero, but grumbling and snarling (especially as often as he does Bilbo, the most personable of the crew) doesn't open him to much sympathy from us. Of the remaining dozen dwarfs, less than a handful are given a chance to develop any personality. Those that do are a cool bunch though. Ken Stott (Balin), Graham McTavish (Dwalin), and especially James Nesbitt (Bofur) get some moments to shine and stand out, but the remaining eight or so dwarfs are practically interchangeable if it weren't for identifying physical traits (e.g. the obese Bombur or the hearing-impaired Óin). I'm hoping we get more from each of them in the next two films.<br/><br/>My issue with the film is that it never should have been dragged out to three films. Tolkien's novel was only around 300 pages and Jackson is insane to try and create a new trilogy out of it. I hadn't read the novel when I first saw the movie in theaters and, even then, I could see the movie was loaded with filler. I read the novel afterwards and discovered just how much of the movie was extra material put in to fill out the nearly 2.5 running time. A 300 page novel spread out over what will undoubtedly be three 2.5 hour moviesthat is just crazy. And if a fan uninitiated to the novel (me) could tell that the movie was padded, then you know it wasn't done well enough. I believe the whole movie could've done without the Azog the Defiler subplot. I can see why it was done (to give the movie an antagonist in the absence of Smaug, who won't even make a full appearance until the second film) but it felt shoe-horned in. Azog the Defiler is a pale orc with a vendetta against Thorin's lineage with no given reason. He just doesn't care for them and he's made it his mission to rid the land of them. So he hunts Thorin over the course of the movie and pads the run-time. I might have accepted it easier if the CG effects used for Azog weren't so bad. Ten years ago, Azog would've been done with practical makeup effects and he would've looked good. Now he's a cartoon.<br/><br/>Speaking of cartoons, I was also put-off by the goofiness of both Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) and the Goblin King. I know the HOBBIT movies are technically based off a children's novel, but the violence and darker content of the movie don't exactly feel like one. But then you have a goofball like Radagast riding a rabbit sled and making stupid faces, or the Goblin King (another CG abomination) and his grand-standing. You can take the HOBBIT one of two ways: a light-hearted children-friendly adventure or a serious epic. I would've been happy with either, but this bizarre blend just doesn't gel with me. In the end, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is mostly fun but it's definitely no LORD OF THE RINGS."

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>169 mins/ 12<br/><br/>Cast: Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Richard Armitage, Christopher Lee, Sylvester McCoy, Ian Holm, Andy Serkis, Elijah Wood, Benedict Cumberbatch, Graham McTavish, James Nesbitt<br/><br/>Director: Peter Jackson<br/><br/>Plot: Bilbo Baggins, a reluctant Hobbit, is forced onto an unexpected journey with a group of dwarfs to defeat the evil dragon Smaug. <br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: As that beautiful Shire music comes bursting in and Gandalf and Bilbo have their legendary 'Good day' conversation, you know that 'The Hobbit"" is going to be an expected triumph. In terms of scope and landscapes, Peter Jackson has overtaken his previous efforts such as Lord of the Rings and King Kong. The fight scenes are entertaining and, mainly down to the dwarfs, the film is very funny. At the start of the film when all twelve dwarfs are introduced they barge into Bilbo's home and start to wreck it. This leads to superb fun as Bilbo tries to prevent them from throwing plates around and doing the washing up. And you can rely on them throughout the film to give hilarious comic relief, even when they are about to be eaten by trolls. As well as new characters, we also get to see old (this being a prequel, actually younger) characters. It is a delight to see Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and of course, Andy Serkis return to their respective roles. The famous riddles scene between Gollum and Bilbo is really something to be amazed at. At almost three hours, it's just a shame that the film struggles to hold your attention for all this time and like 'The Return of the King', has too many endings. Overall, despite lengthy, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is entertaining, funny and brilliantly held together by Martin Freeman, who fits into his role as Bilbo with perfection."

","First off this movies pacing is far better then anyone of the Lord of the Rings movies. Someone took the time to properly convey the story at a much better pace then its predecessors. This movie feels and looks much bigger , just overall larger scale much like the ""Fellowship"" . The companions chosen in this movie we chosen with care and it is well received, they are small, goofy, silly powerful fighter just trying to find the way home . I give this movie an 8/10 the movies negative points for myself is the over use of CGI on Goblins when ""LORDS"" did that much less . The fight scenes also felt a bit slow and not like a fight should be for as skilled as them , Bilbo as well moved way to quickly for never being sword trained."

","To begin with the first form of embellishment is to immediately address the concern that Jackson and co.'s Hobbit may be a painful inflation of a slim, bedtime storybook, as opposed to The Lord Of The Rings' leaner interpretation of a vast fantasy-historical epic. Team Jackson looks outside the novel's narrative (which, while quicker than Rings, is still rich in detail and packed with incident) to the Tolkienverse yonder, and unashamedly treats The Hobbit as a prequel in which the return of Sauron The Deceiver is foreshadowed ominously. <br/><br/>""All good stories deserve embellishment,"" Gandalf The Grey (Ian McKellen) tells Bilbo (Martin Freeman) before the latter has even left the snug, leathery comfort of his Bag End armchair and embarked on his Unexpected Journey. There is no way this line, a pithy conclusion to a tall tale of Bilbo's Tookish grandfather (beheads goblin, invents golf), could have been written unknowingly. The Hobbit is a good story. And embellishment, controversially for some, has been the order of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo Del Toro's adaptation — both narratively (An Unexpected Journey is now a trilogy opener rather than part one of two) and visually; this sunnier, 60-years-younger Middle-earth was digitally shot at double the frame rate of the three earlier movies which concerned this mythic realm's difficult autumn years. <br/><br/>So what, finally, of that other embellishment, the history-making visual treatment? 48 frames per second is, as they say, something else. And you can take that both ways. On the one hand, the crispness of detail is almost overwhelming, whether you're noticing the seam down the back of Gandalf's hat, or repulsed by the scabby goitre dangling from the Great Goblin's (Barry Humphries) hideously distended face. On the other, there's something about the lack of grain and motion blur that oddly makes the movie feel less epic — it's so immediate and intimate that the distance between seat and screen is all but removed. This may make you feel more thrillingly part of the action, or it may diminish the spectacle and unflatteringly highlight the film's more set-bound nature. Something to bear in mind when deciding if you're going to seek out the upgraded experience.<br/><br/>The most powerful moment comes during the Riddles In The Dark incident, which briefly brings back Andy Serkis' Gollum, the other arguably strongest character in the saga. It is a joy and a thrill to once more see mo-cap master Serkis owning the role, and to have the celebrated encounter brilliantly re-envisioned through the prism of the Sméagol/Gollum split personality. However, the true punch of poignancy comes at that most pivotal of moments: when Bilbo, invisibly standing over Gollum with sword at his throat, exercises mercy. Jackson holds on Freeman's face. This isn't just Tim-from-The Office or Watson in pointy ears, but an actor at the height of his prowess finding every layer to a character it now seems he was born to play."
"adamcrossstills","8","0","4","21 June 2013"," Tolkien Geek Review + *SPOILERS*
","CONTAINS HUGE PLOT SPOILERS REGARDING THE HOBBIT, LOTR & MIDDLE EARTH UNIVERSE<br/><br/>I love Tolkien, I love Middle Earth, I love The Lord of The Rings and I love The Hobbit – BUT, that doesn't mean that I've blinded myself when it comes to the film adaptations. The Lord of The Rings adaptations were absolute masterpieces and though many complained about things missing and things added etc I found that these were all for the better and I find them absolutely flawless as a trilogy and arguably the greatest trilogy in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Now, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is, so far, a stand-alone film in a trilogy that doesn't exist yet so it will be different once all 3 movies can be enjoyed in one sitting but I know for sure that The Hobbit is a far from flawless film; I say this as the biggest advocate of directors cuts and the LoTR extended trilogy is amongst my most precious possessions but I really do think that, for a theatrical release, Peter Jackson has crammed far too much into The Hobbit.<br/><br/>I love that he wants to use the appendices at the end of Return of The King to pad out The Hobbit and make for more immersive and as rich an experience as possible before we all exit the world of Middle Earth for good (we all know that The Silmarillion is never going to be adapted to film) but there really are some things in this film that were just not needed at all. The fabrication of the Azog story arc for starters; SPOILERS this story is nowhere in Tolkien's writings as Azog was killed at the Battle of Azanulbizar by Dáin. It's obvious that the fabrication of the ""White Orc"" story arc in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was used to ""hollywood-ise"" the movie and I think the movie would be much more streamlined without it and certain events that Azog is involved with throughout the film could remain faithful to the book instead of involving him when he should've died years before.*<br/><br/>Still, remaining faithful to the book is all well and good but I've already stated that I didn't mind at all the changes made to The Lord of The Rings trilogy and as far as Radagast The Brown is concerned I actually quite like his expanded involvement in The Hobbit movie, even though he was completely omitted in the LoTR films, because how he travels to Dol Guldur and discovers the Necromancer (which isn't quite true, it was actually Gandalf that discovered the Necromancer) will helpfully coincide with the included story of how Gandalf aids in the second attack on Dol Guldur. (deep breath, SPOILERS) The first attack on Dol Guldur was before the events in LoTR and The Hobbit after Gandalf discovered the Necromancer there to be Sauron, after suffering defeat Sauron fled to mordor and returned to Dol Guldor many years later imprisoning Thráin son of Thror after taking from him one of the last 7 dwarven rings of power. Gandalf discovered Thráin upon another mission to the fortress where Thráin gave him the map and key, which Gandalf gives to Thorin in The Hobbit, before dying.<br/><br/>SO, I know that the 2nd and 3rd Hobbit movies are going to be fantastically exciting and may even include some more history of Dol Guldur and of Gandalf's visits there but I'm getting ahead of myself – The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is about 30-45mins too long due to the inclusion of Azog and his expanded storyline throughout the film and back story included at the start of the film and I also think that maybe some of the goblin battles under the mountain go on for much longer than they needed to.<br/><br/>I still think the film is fantastic – but it's just much too long and stuffed with sub-plots that just aren't needed for it's first theatrical release. A theatrical cut should be around the 2 hour mark max, not closer to 3 hours."

","Its not as bad as some say, but its not as good as the LOTR films were. <br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>The stunts were ridiculous. The characters survived unbelievable circumstances, and goblin-town was cartoon-ish. One of the things that was wonderful about the LOTR was that few, if any of the stunts were crazy. The only ones which defied Human ability were done by Legolas, and he isn't human. But here people are surviving rock slides, jumping into other trees while the tree they are in is falling, going swinging on wooden platforms hooked onto ropes, etc. The CGI was a bit too glamorous, although not that bad. The camera was too unrealistic, it was swooping around like a video game. In LOTR, the camera usually stays on the ground, or does a magnificent areal shot, there are some fancy cool camera acrobatics but nothing like they are in the Hobbit. Some of the changes were terrible. Having Thorin hate the elves, (he almost threw Orcrist away when he heard it was an elven blade!), is really bad. Nothing like the book. Some of the characters, such as Azog, were rather poorly done. Other than that, it was good. The action was exiting, the dialog wasn't bad, it wasn't too slow moving. I recommend it overall."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","0","4","29 April 2013"," Jackson's Hobbit Occasionally Drags its Feet, But Remains Adventurously Entertaining
","Much lighter in tone than the preceding Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is more in line with a jaunty fairy tale than a fantasy epic. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing - that's how the source material reads and there's plenty of room in the genre - but it seems to be internally conflicted about that. It's constantly stretching and reaching for more serious, grandiose moments which seem out of place and extraneous. For the most part, though, it strikes the right chords and delivers a jolly, magical adventure that's plenty of fun to tag along with... even if it does grow long-winded in spots. As an audio-visual showcase, though, it never stumbles. From sweeping landscape to stunning vista, breathtaking architectural relics to disgusting subterranean creatures, it runs a vast gamut and never ceases to amaze. For that reason alone, it's worth a long glimpse. The plot does seem overstuffed and more than a little long, but it still feels like there was enough material here to justify three films, which was a concern going in. Adds nice depth to the original three films, although it wisely doesn't try to compete with them."
"jho2121","10","0","7","24 March 2013"," You are all fools if you didn't like it. Just like the critics.
","I'm not petty, I'm not going to review this movie a high score just to up its average user rating. Some of you gave it a 1/10 even though you thought it was a 5/10, just to bring down the rating. That just makes you look petty and ignorant. So congratulations, you know who you are. <br/><br/>As for personal reasons as to why I believe this movie was a complete masterpiece, I have many. <br/><br/>While it has all the familiarity of a Lord of the Rings film, it also sets itself apart and gives itself it's own voice. The Hobbit brings new characters to light to love and cherish, while still keeping around characters we already know. Howard Shore's music, while also familiar, invites new style to go along with the new Dwarven theme of the film. <br/><br/>Most of the negative reviews I've read on here have solely to do with the differences made between the film and the book. Luckily I've read the book, so I can dispel all of your claims and name you idiots. Truly, they did make changed from Tolkiens original work, but the changes were subtle and some would say even necessary. They added in characters (Frodo, Galadriel, etc...) but that is solely for movie-goers who haven't read the book. Plus who doesn't like seeing them on screen again? Weirdos. <br/><br/>They also tuned more into the story of the Pale Orc, where in the book he was merely mentioned briefly. Most likely to add depth and longevity to the films. No doubt they will do the same with the Necromancer in the next film. <br/><br/>While I wholeheartedly agree that the book could have faithfully been interpreted in two films rather than three, I'm also not one to complain about spending MORE time in Middle Earth. Ergo, all of you complaining might not be as big of fans as you think. ;) <br/><br/>The dialogue in critical scenes (the introduction of the Dwarfs to Bilbo, the Gollum scene, etc) remained completely loyal to the book. If anything Jackson gave the dwarfs mentioned less in the book more personality by giving them more time on screen. <br/><br/>I hope to have cleared some of that up for you all. Reading reviews on here has been a painful task, with all the whining and complaining over SIMPLE changes that do not affect the overall outcome of the films. When adapting books to screen, changes must be made. Anyone who read Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and the many others should know this. While we can expect Jackson to cover most parts of the books in his movies (minus a few Dwarven songs, perhaps) we can also expect him to add things to draw the movies through three instead of two, which arguably could've fit things in more tightly and accurately. <br/><br/>But I said it once and I'll say it again, I'm NOT going to complain about more movies. If Jackson really did make 18 or 19 Hobbit films like in that SNL skit, I'd gladly see them all. <br/><br/>Deuces, Biggilos."

","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most outstanding achievements in filmmaking history. They have a great story, great characters, great effects and just a great feel to them. Of course I have only seen them once. I just can't really find the time to watch them, they are so long and I feel obligated to watch them all in one sitting. Now we have the Hobbit, which is a prequel, based on one book and yet it's just as long as the other films. Does it deserve to be that long? No, the answer is no, there is no reason this movie needs to be three hours long. It's three hours long and it feels like it, the pacing in the first half of the movie is so off that I almost wanted to stop watching it. Also it seems this movie is playing it a little too comedically, I know the other movies had comedy, but it seems half the diologue had a punchline. A lot of the characters are just sort of forgettable, and did I mention that it is long? Technical wise though this film is amazing, the visuals, the cinematography, the action, all of these were outstanding. The acting is really good, especially the guy who played young Bilbo, man, he looked exactly what you would expect a young Bilbo to look like when you see old Bilbo. It's nice to see some old faces again such as Sauromon, Frodo, and Hugo Weaving (can't remember his name.)

","Long have I awaited a resemblance of the experience of authentic epicness set by the lord of the rings trilogy! That trilogy was indeed prolonged by a new franchise called ""the hobbit"" aiming to offer the same experience. The hobbit directed by peter Jackson is set in middle earth where a group of 13 dwarfs led by Thorin played by Richard Armitage. Accompanied by the wizard Gandalf the Grey played by Ian McKellen and a hobbit namely Bilbo played by Martin Freeman, is embarking on a journey to retrieve their land taken by the fearful dragon called Smaug.<br/><br/>This movie is dated before the occurrence of the lord of the rings, before Frodo's adventure to destroy the ring. In order to make such a movie, a movie predating a certain point is terribly difficult. The chain of events should be well constructed to suite the events set in the lord of the rings, the character profiling should match that of the original movie and be injected with moments of inexperience, and the mood should be somewhat same yet accompanied by slight changes due to the passing of time as this movie is set 60 years before. this movie brings it all! It offers the same gloomy, uncertainty and fear that the characters feel and is well adjusted so that the viewers feel it as well. What caught my eye the most was the remarkable replication of the distinct feeling that really made the lord of the rings experience unique, the feeling of desiring to go back home! Back to shire. The viewers were well invested in the movie that we too desperately wanted to return to the comfort of the shire. And that is what distinguishes movies apart. How well they develop the characters and their feelings so that the viewers feel it as well. And that was well developed by the hobbit. However, I wanted to see a few moments of rookie actions by Gandalf. We obviously know him as the independent, wise and all knowing wizard that offers his knowledge that is necessary to guide them through this journey, but that was 60 years ago! A lot can happen in 60 years and that was not shown in his character. Speaking of characters, the viewers were satisfied with the character Thorin. He has been approved to lead us in battle and be the Aragorn of the hobbit.<br/><br/>The movie is set in a life that is not our day to day life. It is a new world that the crowd should be introduced to so that we could adhere to its events. That was well produced in the few minutes of narration in the opening moments of the movie. Explaining the new world we are watching and be attached to it. Furthermore, Bilbo's inexperience and immaturity in the aggressive world was well portrayed in his character. It was clearly shown in the way he treated the Gollum threat by playing riddles to get what he wanted. However his character development later was typical at best. A cliché that was due to a minor setback in character profiling.<br/><br/>The hobbit added its comedic touch quite impressively reflecting life's unexpected moments of pure humor. Since this movie is manifested with the goofiness of the dwarfs you would indeed expect more humor here than in the lord of the rings. The graphics on the other hand is incomparable especially with the adjustment to 48 frames per second, it is with this technical improvement that enhances the vividness and expands our imagination and experience to limits never reached not even in the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>Some have deemed the hobbit unfitting to be mentioned in the same sentence as LOTR, the hobbit is not well-equipped to challenge the LOTR' record in the Oscars; And indeed it is. Despite the extraordinary screen writing, the movie had moments here and there, moments of last minute rescue, moments adjusted just to add to the epic journey. On occasions, some scenes were obvious that the screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro twisted around and did not seem coherent with the chain of events. This noteworthy loophole is seen in numerous scripts nowadays. We are living in an era where box office success equals movie success. And this success is achieved with ""out-of-this-world"" action scenes and eye catching punch lines. However that is not suited with life. A movie's resemblance of life determines it's success, and when the rules of life are broken, then that in my eyes is bad screen writing. My point is reinforced in the hobbit's lack of presence in the Oscars; Only getting three Oscar nominations for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects.<br/><br/>If I was wearing a hat and peter Jackson was standing next to me then I would take my hat off and bow in respect. To replicate a mood and setting of a movie made 10 years, to take a 125 paged book called ""the hobbit"" and make into a trilogy of three hours each. And not one moment was felt as slow, or unnecessary, if this isn't great directing then I don't know what is! If your looking for an authentic experience of epicness then this is your movie!"

I would also like to talk about the characters. The brown wizard seems to be a bit unnecessary, and a annoying character. Also i feel like you don't care much about the dwarfs.

","The short: 48fps. Looks just like Lord of the Rings. Is NOT Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The long: It's pretty good. It looks gorgeous. The colours, sets etc are exactly the same as Lord of the Rings, which is a good thing. But it's also not Lord of the Rings. It's based on a short story that Tolkein wrote for his kids, or grand kids. Either way, it's not 3 films worth of material.<br/><br/>That's it's greatest flaw. There is not enough story for 3 films. What's there isn't done badly by any means, but it should have been 2 films, not 3 - and this is coming from someone who liked the film. The initial opening is dull. Long and dull, and oddly uninviting. It goes on for ages, but yet doesn't manage to introduce Hobbiton or characters the way The Fellowship of the Ring did. Which is odd, since The Hobbit has far less in terms of narrative events to work with.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro was originally set to direct, and maybe it would have been better if he had, if for no other reason than it would have been quite different to LOTR. Jackson does a fine job, but it's just more of the same with less substance. del Toro might have brought a completely different vision.<br/><br/>Should you see it is 48fps? Yes, even if just to see what it's like. For the most part, it's great. Creamy, vibrant and bright. Some few small flaws, like the occasional motion looking oddly too quick, but overall it looks great. Obviously people have different views on it. My view is that it's worth seeing at least once. There'll be two more films that you don't have to see in 48fps if you don't like it.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic. There's one flashback scene where dwarfs are fighting Orcs, and it looks superb. Which brings me to the next point: the dwarfs don't look like dwarfs. They look like normal guys, and Gandalf is just really tall. Compared to Gimli, these ""dwarfs"" don't look like dwarfs at all. It's disappointing. Maybe the decision was made because the dwarfs are very prominent characters, as opposed to Gimli, who was really the only dwarf in LOTR.<br/><br/>I'll be looking forward to the next installments."

I mean, every single movie has those sort of jokes nowadays, ENOUGH already!<br/><br/>In any case, it's still enjoyable, it takes you to its world fully, and you will probably enjoy the ride, but the younger you are, the better."

","I enjoyed the overall journey it did start off kinda slow though but once they actually got on the road .The local theater was showing the movie in 48 fps and i noticed a slight difference it's really the same effect you get when you watch a TV show you normally watch on a regular LCD on a led TV with a 1120 or 240 hz refresh rate. it made the cgi seem even more unrealistic than it would appear normally . I'm not a huge fan of middle earth but if your determined to blow some cash and have about three hours to kill you can't go wrong . warning if you were hoping to see more of smaug you'll be disappointed they're saving that for the 2nd film which releases next xmas"
"jandgbristol","7","0","5","29 December 2012"," A good representation of The Hobbit
","Personally I think that the reviews which I heard before watching the film about it being bad and not up to the standard of lord of the rings are all wrong, to be fair it was not up to lord of the rings standards, but the way people judged it so harshly was very unfair. I thought the special effects were excellent especially at the end with the fire. I thought the acting was all together very good and I was entertained by the regular moments of the character Bombur. Obviously I did read the book first and I found that it did stick to the story line however unless I am mistaken I do not remember the wizard Radagast being in the book. In conclusion I think that the film was a great success and director Peter Jackson should be proud of his representation of the hobbit."
"saschakrieger","7","0","4","27 December 2012"," A Long-awaited Journey
","With all due respect: The title is somewhat misleading. This journey was far from unexpected. In fact, there are many in all corners of the globe who have been waiting for this journey to begin ever since Peter Jackson groundbreaking trilogy adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series to the big screen ended in 2003. Now it finally has arrived, after some trouble along the way. Peter Jackson is back at the helm and what was once to be a single film has now turned into yet another trilogy. An interesting choice, considering the fact that not only is The Hobbit only one book compared to the three of The Lord of the Rings, it is even shorter than the shortest of the latter's volumes. A cheap ploy to earn three times instead of once or a chance to do some intricate and detailed story-telling? If the first part is anything to go by, Jackson's choice might turn out to have been a good one.<br/><br/>For if the earlier trilogy had any fault, it was that it did feel a bit rushed at times, that characters were not fully developed, that every now and then the story took a far too sudden and slightly arbitrary turn. It had its narrative holes that could not entirely be filled with stunning scenery, overwhelming special effects and action sequences never seen before. Having said that, The Lord of the Rings did write film history and reaffirmed what used to be a consensus, once upon a time: that the cinema was a place were stories were told that could take the viewer and listener to different worlds and fantastic places, made them see things they had not seen before. Film's power to create its own universe was once thought to be its one great power and The Lord of the Rings brought this back to our time as no film (or three for that matter) had done before.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson is aware of this and of the expectations this entails. And so he throws a long flashback sequence at us that not only tells about the origins of the story to be told but is clearly meant to overwhelm. It takes the audience into a long lost underground kingdom of endless halls, uncounted inhabitants and unimaginable treasures. However, it becomes a little to clear what Jackson tries to do here: first, he wants to outplay the earlier films, show how much more computer animation can do now, that he can still surprise and render the viewer speechless. Secondly, an abundance of elaborate (and fully computer-generated) tracking shots are designed for one thing only: to make the most of the high-end 3D technology the film was made with. It is an uneasy start. Too much surface, too little substance.<br/><br/>And it has another weakness: The charm of The Hobbit has a lot to do with that which makes it different from The Lord of the Rings. It is a much lighter, simpler tale, an old-fashioned adventure story, far removed, from the vast world vision of the trilogy, with its philosophical and metaphysical undercurrent, its many interweaving stories, countless characters and the ultimate war between good and evil. The Hobbit, in contrast is basically a treasure hunt that does not have much more in common with the later novels than its setting and personnel. Jackson, however, seems to distrust its ability to hold its own. So he stresses the connection with the heavier tale and inserts quite a few that weren't in the book. It is no coincidence that it starts on the same day as the trilogy did, that he takes every opportunity to insert characters from it that aren't part of the Hobbit's story, like Frodo, Saruman or Lady Galadriel. He also includes various and increasingly annoying hints and dark insinuations that not all is as simple as it seems that there is something darker and more meaningful and more dangerous working in the background. This is no simple fairytale, Jackson keeps telling us, as if that were a bad thing.<br/><br/>Thankfully, we soon find out that it is not by any means. Because the longer the film lasts, the more its maker seems to trust Tolkien's imagination and does what he does best: translate it into a unique cinematographic language that can suck the viewer right into this strange world full of odd yet mostly lovable characters. And this is where he uses the chance he has given himself by dividing the film into three: he takes the time to tell stories, detailed, elaborate, full of fascinating colours. The sequence in which the dwarfs raid the title character's house and eat up all he has, is a masterpiece of warm- hearted, three-dimensional (in more than one way) and highly comical story-telling. Once Jackson accepts that he is telling a fairytale, the film works its magic. The characters are much more worked out than in the earlier trilogy and Martin Freeman is an ideal Bilbo Baggins: no hero whatsoever but a pompous, nervous, selfish and fearful little everyman, a hero against his will, a perfect fairytale hero.<br/><br/>For The Hobbit is a tale about an ordinary, totally unremarkable person who is able to do great things, not out of heroism but just because he has to. The more Freeman takes over the more The Hobbit separates itself from The Lord of the Rings, shakes off its burden. And suddenly, we find ourself in a fascinating universe that is even more colourful and considerably more alive than that of the trilogy. So much so that in the end, The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey though not quite being the masterpiece Peter Jackson might have hoped for, is at least one thing for certain: a great promise.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"
"TheSquiss","7","0","7","14 December 2012"," Pretty but no masterpiece. Jackson reinvents The Hobbit to suit his pocket, not our expectations
","While Peter Jackson is a fine director, he is emphatically not Tolkien or the authority on Middle Earth.<br/><br/>As with TLOTR trilogy, Jackson has given himself carte blanche over Tolkien's world. We all knew long ago that Jackson decreed Galadriel should feature in his adaptation of The Hobbit despite her absence from its 270(ish) pages, and it was to be expected he'd write Frodo back into the tale so as to bring back the star power of Elijah Wood and allow Ian Holm a cameo as the senior Bilbo Baggins. But Saruman? And Radagast? However, whilst for purists such meddling is unnecessary, Radagast the Brown is an enjoyable and beautifully crafted addition. Let's not forget that Tolkien wrote The Hobbit for children and not for cynical grown-ups or demanding fanboys. Sylvester McCoy embraces the role with humour and is absolutely delightful as Middle Earth's great eccentric.<br/><br/>There has been very vocal criticism of Jackson's decision to shoot at 48 frames per second rather than the standard 24fps and claims the result looks artificial. Twaddle! If we're going to criticize Jackson for The Hobbit, and I will, let's do so over the genuine issues and not for a technical decision that definitely enhances the clarity and vastly reduces the juddering on the panoramic sweeps. New Zealand, sorry, Middle Earth, looks absolutely stunning (top marks again to DoP Andrew Lesnie) and I can't wait to see it in 2D to appreciate it fully without the gimmicks of today's third dimension.<br/><br/>The biggest issues here are pace. It so often feels protracted beyond reason; the clear result of a team thinking of their bank accounts rather than the needs of the novel. The meeting of the council at Rivendell plods like a committee meeting and even the first act takes its time to develop into a film, whereas we meet the dwarfs within a mere 6 pages in the novel and begin the adventure swiftly afterwards.<br/><br/>Jackson seems to have forgotten the gravitas of his original trilogy and has spiced up The Hobbit with slapstick routines rather than occasional, naturally humorous quips. The trolls around the campfire sequence will certainly entertain your youngest children, and those who tend to dribble while they watch, but for discerning viewers it's another moment to look around the auditorium.<br/><br/>I cringed at the announcement that Martin Freeman had been cast as Bilbo. Entertaining as he was in The Office and Sherlock he is an actor of limited range and there is far too much Freeman and too little Holm in his performance. The odd gesture aside, it requires a great suspension of disbelief to imaging this Bilbo Baggins will become TLOTR's Baggins in a mere 60 years. Why oh why didn't Jackson bring in the CGI bods from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to de-age the flawless Holm instead of subjecting us to the hopeful but inadequate Freeman? As with TLOTR, careers will be substantially enhanced by The Hobbit, and chief amongst those will be that of Richard Armitage who draws the attention as Thorin far more than Freeman can manage as the titular character. Whilst the band of dwarfs work well together and are perhaps the greatest part of the film, they are an ensemble and it is difficult to single out a performance from their group. It isn't an issue for the Great Goblin, a character that is as thoroughly enjoyable as he is hideous, played with gusto by Barry Humpfries.<br/><br/>The showpiece character, at least until Smaug arrives, is undoubtedly Gollum and the price of admission is worth it purely for his scenes with Bilbo in the gloom as they riddle for either safe passage or a hobbit-sized meal. It is astounding that the AMPAS has not seen fit to create a 'Vocal & Motion Capture Actor' category at the Oscars and that Andy Serkis has not won it at least three times. Incidentally, Serkis also undertakes second unit director duties on all three Hobbit films, perhaps in preparation for his directorial debut, Freezing Time.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, The Hobbit is a sumptuous visual feast. It demands your attention in a quiet cinema with a vast screen. Don't be put off by the criticisms and decide to wait for it on DVD. The criticisms are perhaps so sharp because we now expect so much more from Peter Jackson. It may not match TLOTR but it is fun, it is beautiful, it is worth the effort to see it and, at times, it is actually quite affecting. In Bag End, as Bilbo slinks off to bed stubbornly refusing to join the quest, the dwarfs sing Misty Mountains and it is an unexpectedly touching moment that takes us closer to the brilliance of TLOTR than almost any other moment in The Hobbit. And the end titles song, Song of the Lonely Mountain, performed by Neil Finn (of Split Enz and Crowded House) is a strong contender for an Oscar after Annie Lennox's success with Into the West. And it's far, far more deserving than Adele's repetitive dirge, Skyfall.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a good film. But it isn't great and it jolly well should be with the money, time and talent that has been thrown at it. After each installment of The Lord of the Rings I departed the cinema desperate for the following twelve months to evaporate so I could watch the next part, or for The Hobbit to miraculously appear. Alas, the final scene of The Hobbit feels exactly what it is: an awkward pause that is entirely out of place, and today I departed not desperate for more but frustrated that the job hadn't been completed.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
"velmawalsh","7","0","8","18 December 2012"," It's no LotR, but...
","I've been looking forward to seeing this film since I first heard it was being made. I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy and have read The Hobbit hundreds of times. I had unbelievably high expectations, which I'm a little sad to say weren't met. That said, The Hobbit is not a bad film, it just doesn't quite live up to the hype. <br/><br/>I'll get the negatives out of the way first. To start with, it really is too long. The addition of extra material from other Tolkien sources may well warrant a trilogy, but there isn't really any reason for this film to be as long as it is. Radagast is a lovely character but his scenes felt tacked in and just distracted from the main action. Unnecessary cameos from LotR cast members adds to the length of the film and little else. The CGI, whilst impressive, doesn't work either. I know the technology is amazing, but actors would've made the villains actually seem like a threat (think Uruk Hai). Granted, it is necessary in some scenes but Jackson relies on it a little too much here. <br/><br/>Other than those negatives, I liked it. The acting is great, with special mentions going to Martin Freeman and James Nesbitt. Freeman is perfect for Bilbo and Nesbitt adds some much needed comedy. Dwarfs aren't as naturally charismatic as other Middle Earth characters (if Gimli wasn't your thing, you'll really hate this movie) but they're given warmth and charm throughout the film. However, Andy Serkis steals the whole film in the riddles in the dark scene (CGI works well here, proof that Jackson can do it nicely sometimes). <br/><br/>Overall, the film is an enjoyable watch. It's fun but frothy, which was inevitable with the source material being a short children's book. I just wish Jackson had been a little more discerning when editing the film as it would've improved ten fold with better pacing."
"rockproductions","7","0","8","18 December 2012"," This May Be a Classic In Time?
","7 Stars = Very Good <br/><br/>As a big fan of ""the Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which I consider the best trio of films ever made, I was ecstatic to hear about a prequel trilogy in ""the Hobbit"" & that Peter Jackson was helming them! I know many don't share that point of view on this new trio of films that have read the books, but as I have not read either ""the Lord of the Rings"" or ""the Hobbit,"" it pretty much goes without saying that I'm not here to compare the movies to books, but movies to movies. So with much relish, I went to ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" today, & to be honest, I was not overwhelmed, but I was not underwhelmed either.<br/><br/>Yes, I went into this film reading several reviews about it, so I was not expecting the pure cinematic magic & genius of the prior films, & I didn't get that, but I got a film that may go on to classic status, but never masterpiece. Without giving a million things away about the film, I will say that there are several down falls here. For one, ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" does not have the feeling of impending doom & desperation that the first three have. It veers to far towards a children's film the first half of the movie, with to much cuteness & comedy taking place, & not enough serious content. Though it starts out pretty good in setting the story up the first 15-20 minutes, one has to wonder how the dwarfs ever made it to the status of overlords? Their pretty much portrayed as something more akin to ""Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs,"" as all except a couple of the dwarfs are inept in their intelligence, & seem to want to just eat, drink & be merry. Here I think Jackson made the same mistake as ""Star Wars"" episodes, ""Return of the Jedi"" (discounting the final show down between Luke, Darth Vader, & the Emperor), & ""the Phantom Menace."" Jackson dummied the movie down to appeal to a young audience, taking the chance of alienating the older adult audience. Also, another mistake made in this film is that Jackson threw everything he could possibly dream up in ""Middle Earth,"" & tossed it at you like a asteroid hurdling towards you through the movie screen at the speed of light. I mean, there was two, maybe three times the variety of creatures than previous films, & just to many characters to really be able to grasp & hold on to, & feel a real connection with. There was just to much shoved into a to small time frame of space, even if the film is almost three hours long. In this respect, ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" pales before the first three films, but then again, this is a very tall order, & Jackson is proved to be human after all. Another downfall for me was that Bilbo Baggin's character just was not what I expected, but I can see him growing into the character I knew from ""The Lord of the Rings."" Especially starting with the meeting of Bilbo & Gollom, in a very well done scene on how Bilbo acquired the ""Precious."" I can see this character maturing & becoming the heart of the films.<br/><br/>Even with all I said I didn't like about ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" there is more I liked. I really can't put a finger on it, but I feel this film will grow on me with repeated viewings. It has a great premise, & a director that is capable of taking it to greater heights with the two following films, if he fixes the mistakes made here. I do have to say the 3-D was amazing, & really made ""Middle Earth"" come to life, though in the fast moving sequences, there was some blur with the background. This will most likely be fixed & improved on. It also does not hurt that many characters from ""The Lord of the Rings"" have returned with the same actors. I look forward to their roles & the part they'll play in the future films! <br/><br/>All in all, this is a film that may reach classic status with me in time. It was a huge undertaking, & had almost the impossible task to live up to ""Lord of the Rings."" For the time being, I'll rate this a very good film, that you should see for yourself & make your own opinion. It is well worth the watch!"
"derwatz","7","0","8","18 December 2012"," only one third of a film, HFR on a long way!
","... I saw the movie on Friday in Mülheim CinemaxX. In 3D and HFR nearly 15 Euros were due. To put it straight to the point, the image was technically, for long stretches, a major disappointment for me. I had expected much more. It is primarily about the incident, and blurred images of lackluster film, he plays during the day. The picture was generally too dark and the 3D effect is often just a sad show effect. When it got dark, the overall impression was much better. The picture was excellent on the Gollum and the battle with the Orcs. The sharpness of the image and impression has voted with my expectations almost identical. This nonsense, because of Soap effect, super sharp, etc. probably comes only from people who can not distinguish a good picture from a bad one. For me it is unfortunately different. The film itself is quite OK, just a shame that he does not even begin to come to an end. Here, we will probably have to watch all the parts. Because in the future, but on BD. HFR has a good future, if not more bad implementations mess up this great option of cinema. And there are too many bad 3D. Even the cinema often provides not the best picture. The Cinemax has already disappointed me very often because of faulty presentation. But they do not mind, while only a few complain ... In the medium term I'll probably have to buy a projector. Well the movie itself I have given 70%. For fans a must, for me the story was OK, but I had the feeling of having seen only 1/3 of a film."

","While i still think this might not surpass the LOTR franchise, i do believe Peter Jackson once again drive home an epic male journey in his unique style. You'll find yourself connected to a lot of male struggles throughout this movie, some subtle, some obvious, some even make you cry On one hand, you got the Hobbit who never leave his nest, enjoy his books rather than road trip. He thought he had got his life figured out, but the reality is he has been living in a giant doubt about himself, once he hopes to find the answer in the trip On the other, we got the Dwarf King living in anger seeking vengeance over his father's death. Among these two guys' challenges, we got to witness great friendship and sacrifice one could offer another in time of despair<br/><br/>I did not really pay attention to the movie in the first 10 minute or so because i thought the set up was boring and some home i jump to early conclusion that this is just a feast of the eyes no more, and another Narnia movie..but as it progresses to the scene where all the dwarfs soldiers sit silently in front of the fireplace singing a sad tune..I know I'm watching a masterpiece"

There is nothing to hate about this movie but it is surely not the best movie. It takes half an hour just to get out of Bilbo's door where the story gets stretched and i was very happy to see gollum(my favorite) on screen.<br/><br/>It is an exiting story easy to follow and it is visually mesmerizing and, even though I am never too happy & comfortable about wearing 3D glasses.
