","There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.<br/><br/>I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our ""homework"" for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.<br/><br/>Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to ""seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary"" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.<br/><br/>The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.<br/><br/>So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece."
"fred-kolb","10","90","95","17 November 2008"," Seize the Day- One of the Greatest Movies Ever!
","Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I'd be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.<br/><br/>The movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or ""Oh Captain, my Captain"", based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>There are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he's an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn't give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he's so embarrassed.<br/><br/>Peter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie ""Master and Commander"" shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.<br/><br/>Some of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that ""he wanted to throw up at the end of the film"". I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won't put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!"
"blissfulmitch","10","319","355","4 February 2005"," Carpe Diem, because the days don't stand still
","First of all, this is movie is my all-time favorite, out of all the hundreds of films I have seen. However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with ""It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s."" After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Then we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.<br/><br/>And lastly, the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary."
"CMTiago","9","45","48","12 August 2014"," Thank You Captain
","It was with a sad reason that I re watched Dead Poets Society, as we lose yet another talent and an all round good person in Robin Williams. This being my favorite Williams film, I took it upon myself to honor his memory by remembering his best body of work, in my opinion. Mr. Keating is the teacher that I wish I had, and granted this might be a mixed opinion within the film's context, but the matter of the fact is that he was no ordinary teacher, and that's something you don't see very often.<br/><br/>The thing about this film is that it doesn't shorten its importance to Williams's performance. The supporting cast is one that balances the film like no other. Every one of those students that revived the DPS is, in one way or another, influenced by Mr. Keating, be that positively or, unfortunately, negatively. The story being an Oscar winning screenplay, is one that I think mostly resonates with younger people, and with this movie being part of my 10th grade Portuguese course, I, personally, embraced its essence and of course its driving message of seizing the day.<br/><br/>As I've seen here on IMDb, this movie might not gather nearly uncontested praise, but it is very much highly regarded today as it was 25 years ago. The final scene still gives me chills to this day, and in the midst of our sad goodbye to Mr. Williams I just wanna say Thank You My Captain. It was a pleasure learning to become my own motivated person. May we all Carpe Diem<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"
"ijtfalcon","10","127","148","20 January 2003"," Excellent
","I have no need to summarize this movie seeing as how most people tend to do that anyway so, therefore, any addition of such would simply be frivilous. However, I am somewhat disappointed to see how people tend to misinterprate this film by proclaiming that the movie's message of carpe deium is derailed by the fact that those who apply it end up losing.  This could not be further from the truth.  In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous.  The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove.  Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority.  Some may not like it but his story serves to prove just how important it is to stand one's ground no matter how hard it may be.  It's not only his character, but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth.  <br/><br/>I urge everyone to give this movie a chance and to see it for what it really is.  It may just change your life."
"roghache","10","150","178","3 March 2006"," A masterful tribute to teaching at its best
","Dead Poets Society is, to use a cliché, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.<br/><br/>The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that's just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon's ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.<br/><br/>Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of ""seizing the day"". How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless ""Introduction to Poetry"" from the time honored Pritchard textbook! <br/><br/>The ""Dead Poets Society"", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.<br/><br/>It's an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.<br/><br/>This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only ""Carpe Diem"", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever."
"connie-baldini-427-561037","10","24","26","12 August 2014"," Make Your Lives Extraordinary
","So today is August 12th and news has broken of Robin Williams' untimely death. I just felt compelled to review my favourite movie of his. On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day: O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It's not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams' performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it's hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It's almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he's most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin's death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly ""moved"" in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won't be sorry."
"chic1224","10","186","230","28 March 2000"," Poetry on the screen
","Not only will this movie touch your heart and bring tears, it will inspire you to be a better teacher to others and to follow your dreams no matter what the boundaries may be.  It is truly poetry on the screen... a great story and a touching social commentary on humanity and life's greatest challenges.  If you haven't seen it yet, rent it now.  It has taken my love of poetry to an entirely new level!"
"BluebirdSeventeen","9","23","26","24 August 2014"," Includes a short inspired poem. Your verse.
","Swim against the stream <br/><br/>What this film did for me? I found myself 'standing up on that desk' to remind myself that I should be constantly viewing the world with new perspective. <br/><br/>A magical film, and despite it being made in 1989, still completely and maybe even more relevant to today's society. In a world of mass conformity, largely created by social media and smart phone technology, especially among the young and teenagers, it is ever more important to be inspired by and pursue what this film teaches us. <br/><br/>We need to find our own voice among the crowd. Make your life extraordinary. <br/><br/>It renews, inspires and restores a feeling of passion for words, poems, literature and life! Passion for learning and excelling / expressing ourselves. Keeping your eyes open, looking backwards and forwards, never down. Life is not 1 dimensional. Life is about expression; expressing those many layers and dimensions which make up the fabric of life. This film completely encompasses that sentiment. Striving to find your own voice. Finding words and meanings to best depict the inner workings of your life and mind. <br/><br/>""We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.""<br/><br/>You can learn a lot from this movie. In society/ schools nowadays we are constantly being bombarded - told how to do things, why, and what they mean. we are filling up our brains with junk yet we have a world of knowledge, quite literally, right at our fingertips. Yet have we lost a sense of curiosity? Have we stopped asking why?<br/><br/>My favourite scene was the one in the dormitory room, when the boys are playing, jumping across beds and desks, chasing each other round the room, round and round in circles. I think the directing and camera work is fantastic here, with the camera positioned in the middle of the room shooting upwards and following the boys in a rather dizzying way - it completely encompasses the ultimate freedom and spirit of the film. <br/><br/>Powerful directing. Magical visuals- autumnal lake scenes and old New England buildings. Dead poets society made me both laugh and cry a lot. Almost a therapeutically good movie. It will stay with me for a long time to come. Robin Williams was wonderful too. RIP.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 and I want to watch it again already. <br/><br/>Remember you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play *goes on* and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?<br/><br/>Oh, one extra thing. <br/><br/>Here is my inspired 5 min poem:<br/><br/>Your verse? <br/><br/>Quick fast tick tock, Skim swipe tick tock, Glowing face tick tock, Head down tick tock, Marching stomp tick tock.<br/><br/>Each day tick tock Faced with a question tick tock, Your verse tick tock, Two roads tick tock, Diverging <br/><br/>Follow your path tick tock, Open your eyes tick tock, Face the world tick tock, Seize the day tick tock, Listen<br/><br/>One day tick tock, Lie with the daffodils.

Post a reply in the message boards if you too felt inspired. <br/><br/>(Oh also I'm not claiming to be Tennyson here....just an enjoyable way to spend a Sunday morning reflecting on this wonderful film I watched last night. Think of those boys at the front of the class before you choose tear it apart! :-) )"
"pompaj","Null","95","121","17 July 2000"," A terrific film
","There's so much good about this movie. The first time I saw it I watched it solely for plot and I loved it. Now I've seen it again and watched Peter Weir's filming and timing which is also great. Robin Williams is a terrific actor when he's serious. He proved it in Good Will Hunting but he proved it first here. If you liked that movie and your liking it had something to do with Williams than you will like this one. The plot is about a number of students who are taught by Williams about life. They are taught how to enjoy themselves. This ends up causing great controversy among the heads of the school. The students are terrific and even the dialogue is great. This is a movie that I can't imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way."
"jchckid","10","161","214","19 March 2001"," this movie is the greatest movie, with excellent cinematic techniques.
","The film Dead Poets Society is a film that explores the idea of ""Carpe Diem"" (seize the day) from the viewpoint of a classroom of young men at an all boys boarding school. Their teacher Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams)helps them stretch their minds, and exercise their right to defiant acts of love for life and poetry, rebuttlng society. The director Peter Weir treats you with eye candy by using various camera shots of beautiful scenary, and neat techniques. Weir takes you on a roller coaster that leaves you gripping your seat, enjoying life, and thinking ""Carpe Diem"" in your own life. There are some very depressing scenes, but they are very artful, and teach you of appreciation for those brave members of society that dare stand up for their beliefs, and rights to wrestling around with life. I thought Ethan Hawke (Todd Anderson) gave a true life twist to the film, Robin Williams (Mr. Keating or also known as Captain my captain) added an element of excitement, and Robert Sean Leonard (Neil Perry)added passion that leaves you mesmerized. I just saw this film in English class, but I immediatly fell in love with it, as I know you will."

There are many good films.Also there are probably many better than this one;cause it's not flawless. But if you believe that a movie can change your life, I have no doubts that this one can influence you as no other. If you have not watched it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

","Dead Poets Society is a thoroughly moving, and inspiring film from Peter Weir, who is definitely one of the most under rated directors around. This movie is in the same vein as ""A Separate Peace"", in the sense of setting, and in the general coming of age story line. The basic message is to ""suck the marrow out of life"", as the passage for the society reads, or to live every moment to the fullest. It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion. This is a must see."

","I saw it only yesterday. Of course I had heard of it, I had been thinking of watching it one day. Well, this day was yesterday.<br/><br/>To be honest, I expected it to be something light and pretty positive, I couldn't foresee any drama coming, I could have but I didn't.<br/><br/>This school is a good example of our educational system, where we are taught to obey the rules, do what we are told to, be like robots. This movie was shot in 1989, but not that much has changed since then. Open the page, read what is written there, sit straight, listen to the teacher, no talking, no fun.<br/><br/>And then there's this new inspirational teacher Mr. John Keating who teaches his students to believe in themselves, to try new things, to love poetry. He is an amazing teacher, the one most students would want to have, but of course too great and a bit of an outsider in this boring and traditional school. He doesn't tell the students what to do, he doesn't give advice, he just helps them release their spirit of freedom, leave their comfort zone and try new things. And the students love him, look up to him, trust him.<br/><br/>And then in the end he is the one who gets punished. Not Neil's father who couldn't even be honest to himself and admit what he had done to his son. And the school didn't need the truth, neither did the other parents. They all seemed soulless and heartless.<br/><br/>I did love the last scene. It was honest and brave. And it showed that Mr. Keating had changed these boys, had made them stronger and better people."

","Dead Poets Society was one of my favourite movies when I was about 12 years old. It was a long time ago since I'd last seen it and I kinda expected it to have lost something over the years. Not true at all. The story's message still very much applies today and always will: make something of your life, enjoy it as much as you can.<br/><br/>When you watch this beautifully acted, directed and well shot film, you can't help but be genuinely be seized by emotion. Several scenes are stunning, yet it never gets sentimental and stays sincere throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Because he was such a fantastic emotional actor, Robin Williams was the perfect choice to play John Keating, an original English teacher who wants his students to think for themselves, not only about poetry but also about life itself. If there'd be a John Keating in every school, the world might just become a little more interesting. <br/><br/>Definitely a must-see classic."
"tats2duhmax","Null","61","92","31 December 2004"," A fantastic representation of belief and individualism
","Dead Poets Society was a movie that took some in depth realization. Robin Williams did a fantastic job depicting individualism and how to walk on your own. He realized that these young men were going to be shaped in either a bad way or could shape themselves into the type of men they wanted to become.Sure, everyone around them were jerks and stiffs but that is the environment of the school. People just didn't go up against all odds, and everything was OK. That is exactly what Dead Poets Society was showing. Even though there were consequences to the boys being inspired and re-forming ""Dead Poets Society"" they still learned to march to their own drummer. They could be boys and go for their own dreams and ambitions. This movie showed Williams in a different light and i have so much respect for his character. He believed enough in these boys to loose his job. Standing on desks may not make everything better, but it shows the real meaning of the movie. These boys had been taught to conform and put their beliefs aside, but Williams opened up their hearts and made a lot of people, whether they liked it or not, realize that tradition is not always the way to push your children. If all you can look at is the expression on Neil Perrys fathers face, when he realized what his son had done, then you really didn't get the point. This was not Mr. Perrys life, and Williams knew that and was not about to cover up Neils dreams and tell him exactly the opposite of what he had been teaching him all along. Dead Poets Society was an unbelievable movie that showed how this teacher believed so much in his students, that it changed their lives."

","I'm impressed. It was an all around good film. Perhaps I'm biased - Robert Frost's poem, A Road Not Taken, was quoted - yet so many other things were as well.<br/><br/>It's not about poetry. It's about how you look at the world. How you look, how others look... how you think, how you feel... and a warning to never, ever become conformist (though being conformist about walking is perhaps slightly exaggerated). Never become conformist - always make up your own mind.<br/><br/>I liked the music, as well. The bag pipes give a certain special touch.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 - a high score for me."

","""Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect."" - Mark Twain <br/><br/>The ""teaching genre"". Typically these films deify heroic teachers whose classrooms are havens at odds with the conformity or mediocrity that plagues the rest of the institution. In this regard, these films merely take familiar stories about admirable loners and nonconformists and place them in an educational setting in which the school milieu is fairly incidental.<br/><br/>Films like ""Stand and Deliver"", ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Mr Holland's Opus"", ""To Sir, with Love"", ""Dangerous Minds"", ""Coach Carter"", ""Mona Lisa Smile"", ""Music of the Heart"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""School of Rock"", ""Little Man Tate"", ""Dangerous Minds"", ""Freedom Writers"", ""Pay It Forward"" etc etc all follow the same narrative progression, the inspirational white/black teacher moving to a school where he/she is forced to deal with various problems (racial tensions, student apathy, learning difficulties and institutional barriers), all of which he/she solves by delivering inspirational messages in offbeat ways.<br/><br/>Very few ""teaching films"" deviate from this formula. Some of the best that do are perhaps Frederick Wiseman's ""High School"", ""High School 2"" and ""State Legislature"", Laurent Cantet's ""The Class"", Nick Ray's ""Bigger Than Life"", Olivier's ""Term of Trial"", 2002's ""To Be and To Have"", and ""The Prime of Mrs Jean Brodie"", with Maggie Smith. For the most part, though, cinema has failed to produce many interesting ""teaching movies"".<br/><br/>And so ""Dead Poets"" is another mushy ""teacher flick"" which advocates ""independence"" and ""non conformity"" by sticking to a very generic and clichéd movie formula. Here, the maverick teacher is played by Robin Williams, a wacky guy who inspires his band of students to ""seize the day"" and ""chase their dreams"".<br/><br/>The film was directed by Peter Weir, and so it has a certain classiness which, at first glance, seems to differentiate it from the pack; it's low-key at times, well acted and beautifully shot. It's only during ""Poet's"" last half hour that we realise how much we've been conned. And so as Weir's plot draws toward a typical ""I am Spartacus!"" ending (you'll know it when you see it), we begin to grasp how goofy the picture really is, the film populated by one dimensional adults, villainous kids, ridiculously stuck-up parents and a plot which reduces the art of poetry to a couple selectively chosen one liners, all designed to illicit ""rebelliousness"" and ""non conformity"".<br/><br/>So serious is the film in its message, that it even has one kid commit suicide because he is unable to break free of his father's wishes. In other words, conformity literally kills, physically as well as spiritually. This is a worthwhile message, but the film is so conventionally manipulative in its final half, that all power quickly fizzles out.<br/><br/>For a film which pretends to profess a love for poetry, you might even call this flick anti-poetry. Early in the film, Robin Williams draws a graph on a blackboard which he says is used to ""measure the worth of a poem"". On one axis of the graph is a poem's ""importance"" or ""depth"", on the other axis of the graph its ""perfection"" or ""technique"", the implication being that a work of art which succeeds on both axes, or very highly on one, is discernibly ""better"" than others. Williams then erases this graph and orders his pupils to tear it out of their textbooks. You cannot measure the objective worth of art, he says, only what that art means to you personally.<br/><br/>Later, one kid who spends hours and hours toiling over his poems, discarding them all because he doesn't think them any good, is put in front of the classroom and told to ""let go"" and ""just say what comes into your head"". Suddenly he becomes like all the other students in the film, able to magically and whimsically create great poetry. What the film is advocating is not some kind of objectively great poetry, which artists strive for and toil to create, but misusing poetry as a metaphor for a kind of whimsical freedom of expression; nothing matters other than your own subjective feelings and opinions. Nothing matters, other than you conforming to your desires, embracing your right to free speech and impulsively doing and saying what you want at any particular moment. This isn't poetry, this isn't artistic expression, it's just a kind of self-obsessed, narcissistic, rash impulsiveness.<br/><br/>Now look at all the things the students in the film use poetry to achieve. It's all sex, girls, dancing or throwing things away. Very simple, egotistical, hedonistic or impulsive things. Children and people with bipolar disorder have been shown to act with more impulsivity than other people. Artists, of course, are themselves often described as being childish (or possessing a child's imagination) and are more prone to being bipolar. What the film is unconsciously doing is tapping into the whole ""artist as free"" and ""art as childish impulsiveness"" cliché, without marrying it to anything truly substantial.<br/><br/>The limits of this approach are best observed in the film's final scenes. The young artists are given the chance to save their teacher, but instead choose to save themselves. They've never been taught, through poetry or art, to really stand up for anything of value external to themselves. Only later, when their teacher is kicked out of school, do they impulsively stand on their desks and show him support. But of course now it's a wasted gesture.<br/><br/>Significantly, the one kid who ""stands up"" in defence of his teacher is the one kid who was serious about poetry and seemed sceptical of William's character. His act of ""standing up"" is the only true act of rebellion in the film, the artist putting himself on the line, standing up for something worthwhile. Weir completely misses the implications of this. <br/><br/>7.9/10 Generic. Worth one viewing. See ""If"" and ""The Magdalene Sisters""."

","In a sense, this movie was indeed the celebration of Dead Poets the world over! <br/><br/>Dead Poets Society! I am guessing a large number of you, like me, were expecting a bunch of spooky irregular events at the mutter of that name. Certainly wasn't to be, it is an inspirational odyssey which will make you pounce upon time and reclaim your life. Carpe Diem and the spirit that John Keating (played by Robin Williams) stands for could easily be misinterpreted by the turn of events in the movie, especially Neils poignant death. To do so is to completely miss the point. The spirit of Carpe Diem lies in the painstaking eventualities which one will have to brave to follow the lead of passion and fervour. <br/><br/>Robin Williams plays a professor of poetry, John Keating at the prestigious Welton School, with a management making sufficient hay with the schools continual academic shine. His particularly unorthodox methods of teaching soon make one realize that poetry is not something to do with rhyming words or fantasy lands, but that poetry is in effect a direct means to ones disposition in life, a disposition which would ring success in all avenues. His students soon change their very outlook towards life indulging in activities much to the displeasure of the academically unbending deans of the school. Harvesting discontent against Keating, the deans soon latch on to the one opportunity(or mis-opportunity I must say) that comes their way in the form of Neils death to see the removal of Keating from the school and the teaching profession. <br/><br/>The last few minutes celebrate every individualistic spirit to let you segue into a illusive reality. A young Ethan Hawke playing an even younger student redeems his professors every drop of sweat with ""Oh Captain! My Captain!"" . Watch the movie and you will see why! At least for half an hour after I watched this movie, I managed to drive mans favorite cliché ""Life Sucks!"" into oblivion. I suppose the students at Welton were not the only ones Professor John Keating inspired."

","Not every thing that's expected from you is your only motive of life. This movie in a great manner teaches us to listen and regard the voice of our soul, the voice of our self.<br/><br/>Basically the story is about a English Literature professor Mr. John Keating who is a replacement for the previous professor and is conducting his very first class for the school. His idea of teaching is very different and informal, based more on practicality rather than just reading words written in the book. Being literature his subject, he inspires his students to weave their own thoughts, he encourages them to use their own imaginations. He clearly believes that everybody has their own personal sense of seeing this world, interpretating things in their own way.<br/><br/>The influence of Mr. Keating on the boys can be judged from their inclining interests towards poetries and proses. They reframe Dead Poets Society which is a kind of club of people reading out poetries among the group. Meanwhile, they also learn to listen to their calling. And then series of events goes on and by the end of that, you will be left with tears in your eyes.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie is so perfectly done. The character of Mr. Keating played by Robin Williams is flawless. The smirk on his face puts a different charm and it always keeps you under impression of his control over the situation. Also the character of Neil played by Robin Sean Leonard keeps you gripped to the emotions that the movie is carrying throughout.<br/><br/>This is a kind of movie that will make you think about yourself, your dreams and desires. You will be left with the tears of happiness and a sense of introspection. Moreover, if you have interest in writing or have given it a try sometime, this movie is surely going to boost your morale and confidence."

Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) upset the delicate sensibilities of those social elites once he was hired to teach there. He introduced the boys to the Dead Poets Society in order to give them life. But it seemed that life was a four-letter-word at Welton.<br/><br/>""Dead Poets Society"" is probably the most uplifting and moving movie one can watch in which all of the characters are rich socialites.

","""Dead Poets Society"" is more than a lesson of life. It's a hymn to life. It has a good message: ""Carpe diem"", which means ""Seize the day"". I completely agree with that message because there's no coming back and time flies.<br/><br/>It's a reasonable movie with an inspiring story, good message, great performances from the actors, wonderful sceneries, awesome soundtrack (classical music, for example), drama and comedy.<br/><br/>John Keating is the kind of teacher that anyone would like to have as a teacher. A teacher with such a colorful imagination and sense of humor, a teacher who inspires his students to make their dreams come true and makes their lives extraordinary. I mean, wow! John Keating is brilliantly performed by the comedian Robin Williams. In general, Robin Williams is as humorous as usual in this movie, but we can also see some of his talent for drama.<br/><br/>Besides this incredible teacher, other great characters are: Neil Perry, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, Todd Anderson and even Richard Cameron (although he has the power to anger us at the end because of his attitude). All of them are very well played by the actors.<br/><br/>About the boys, Charlie Dalton aka ""Nuwanda"" is the funniest of all. He's just hilarious! ""Nuwanda"" is such a funny nickname - lol.<br/><br/>Todd Anderson is a shy character portrayed by Ethan Hawke. This actor looked so different when he was younger and his role here is completely different from (for example) ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"".<br/><br/>Mr. Perry (Neil's father) is a complicated character. Like Kurtwood Smith himself says, «he's understandable, not likable». He doesn't let Neil do what he wants and controls all of his life and future.<br/><br/>The ending is somehow... empty: Neil dies and ""Nuwanda"" is expelled.

","Dead Poets Society is hands down one of the most powerful and upfliting movies that I have seen-and trust me I have seen many powerful movies. This is one of Robin Williams finest performances-I do believe he should have been at least nominated for best actor and either the guy who plays Neil or Ethan Hawk should have been nominated for best supporting actor.The frindships that are forged in the school are genuine and believable and the people are those that you can relate to. I myself can relate to Todd, shy and a bit insecure of who he is. John Keating-played by Robin Williams-is a teacher who believes in more then just teaching about whats in the books, he believes in teaching about *life* and seazing the day. This movie shows how important it is to live each day to your fullest and to follow your dreams. I have seen many powerful films, and Dead Poets Society is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It captures the essance of what a film should to do a person. It shows a different view of life and makes you question things. It brings tears in your eyes as well as laughter. Even though I get emotional during films very rarly do I cry in them, but I did cry during the end of the movie with what happened to Neil and Keating. The ending to this day had a powerful effect on me and not many movies has an effect on you to the point where you get emotional and uplifted just thinking about the movie. It is a movie where you would watch many times and each time find something new with it. It is by far one of the most amazing and uplifting movie experiences that I have ever had."
"ConallMcCormick","7","4","5","7 March 2018"," What Makes a Good Film?
","I find it ironic that I am attempting to provide a, largely, objective assessment of this film; a task which the film's main character, John Keating, a poetry teacher, would view with derision. His personal philosophy is that poetry (and by extension, I imagine, all other forms of art e.g. filmmaking) should be viewed entirely subjectively. That art cannot, or should not, be objectively scrutinised but that the importance of any piece of art is in the emotions that it may evoke in its audience members. The reaction of the audience member to any piece of art is, of course, unique to the individual and that is where the value truly lies.<br/><br/>Keating's intellectual adversary in this film is the author of the ""Introduction to Poetry"" Mr Pritchard. His assessment of poetry is cold and detached, believing that poetry can be objectively assessed like a mathematical formula in order to determine its importance. This dogmatic view is, naturally, in the same line of thinking as the strict, prestigious school that the film takes place in. The school is seen to be ruthless in the application and preservation of this soulless mentality which indoctrinates its students. It is, of course, the clash of these contradictory ideologies which creates the central conflict of the narrative.<br/><br/>However, I do have major disagreements with how this conflict is presented in this film. Namely, that the film is rather simple in its assessment of this rather complex issue and presents it in a black and white fashion. Keating is seen as the hero of the narrative and his philosophy is presented as, ironically, the objective truth in the overall question. I feel that the school and, the figure of Mr Pritchard, come across as quite exaggeratory and caricatural in the examination of the opposing philosophy. As an agnostic nihilist I understand that life is meaningless and that the only option humans have is to ascribe meaning to whatever we deem appropriate. That is to say that, to the fullest extent, Mr Keating is 100% correct in his worldview. That the examination of art IS entirely subjective because there can be no objective standard.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the strict adherence to this worldview is, I find, extremely problematic. There may not be an objective standard for the arts or to the meaning in life but humans do need that structure to exist as a society AND to adequately assess the arts. I think to prove this point I think one merely needs to look at the postmodern art scene. The current school of thought that ""anything is art"" also means that ""nothing is art"" as a consequence. It's a sad state of affairs when an unmade bed can LITERALLY be deemed as a work of art and can be perceived as being of equal worth as, say, the ceiling of the Sistine chapel. Under Keating's worldview the two are inherently (but more importantly readily PERCIEVED) to be equitable since there is no objective standard (other than what one ascribes). This is what, I feel, has led to the degradation of modern art where the skill and artistry derived from objective standards and tutelage in the past has been lost/overlooked.<br/><br/>Indeed, in the film Keating is faced with the problems of his own ideology. One of the students produces a poem that reads ""The cat sat on the mat"" which mockingly exposes the flaws of his philosophy. One of his students becomes quite anarchic when he buys fully into Keating's worldview only to be (arguably hypocritically) reprimanded by Keating himself for his actions. To further illustrate this point I shall use another example. With nihilism, and the lack of objective meaning, there is no reason WHY a man couldn't kill another man if he felt like it (if he knew he could get away with it) as there is no reason why he should or shouldn't do so. Naturally, the reader of this review understands this to be an ""objective wrong"" as that is the reality of the society we have been conditioned by. Therefore, that obejctivity exists (if not in the truest sense). Ultimately, Keating is correct in that the reason we have the arts is for the emotions that they evoke in us and the value that we ascribe to them. There are plenty of ""objectively"" bad movies that I love but the fact that they are objectively flawed doesn't hinder my enjoyment of them. However, I do think that the acknowledgment of these flaws is of crucial importance.<br/><br/>In short, to justify my ACTUAL review of this film (which I haven't even STARTED yet!) I first had to tackle its underlying philosophy to explain the legitimacy of my objective assessment. Yes, it is true that any piece of art (be it poetry, filmmaking etc) is entirely subjective to the fullest extent. However, practically speaking, it is really more of a mix between the objective and the subjective; even if the objective is merely a delusion which we (as a society) collectively endorse.<br/><br/>With that lengthy explanation in mind I can now identify what I understand to be the objective assessment of this film.<br/><br/>I think that, before attributing one's subjective value onto a film, a baseline must be set determined on the objective success (or failure) of a film on a technical level. This film is around the 7/10 mark (i.e. a ""good"" film) as far as I'm concerned. I can certainly understand why people would give it between a 5 (""average"") and an 8 (""great"") out of 10 as this is where the grey area lies as to the range out emotional investment and subjective assessment exists. However, to give this film any higher or lower (I think) lacks real insight into the strengths, or limitations, of this work.<br/><br/>To begin with, I feel that the narrative was solid and enjoyable. The dialouge inparticular is its greatest quality and produces some really great interactions between characters. The character of Mr Keating (played by the late-great Robin Williams) is the centrepiece of the film and the source of its wise and insightful dialouge. Williams is more witheld in this film than his other films but this only serves to create an enigmatic aura around his character. He exudes a great warmth and passion which is made readily evident. Its a good performance but certainly not his best (""Good Will Hunting"") as his character doesn't have a great deal more depth beyond his role as an educator and mentor to expose weaknesses in his character.<br/><br/>The limitation of the film is that the story is very predicatable and there was no point when I was thrown off track. The change in events that occur in this film is down to the shifting motivations of the students. Of the large group, three are of prime focus: Neil, who feels oppressed by his father, Todd, who is experiences problems with his introversion and Knox, who is too shy to talk to the woman he loves. By these brief explanations of these three protagonists you can almost already figure out what the end result will be. This is largely what prevents the film from ever attempting to reach a higher threshold of significance. Despite the limited scope of the narritive this is beneficial to the film in the fact that it keeps it well contained and is as clear and concise as it could have been.<br/><br/>I'd say that the antagonists in the film (being the principal and Neil's father, among others) are very one-dimensional and don't really enhance the story greatly. However, since the overall point of the film is to challenge and resist conformity it is, perhaps, beneficial in a much broader wider context with this in mind. The performances from the extended cast (beyond Robin) are very good and for a film that really depends on the strength of its young actors does a terrific job.<br/><br/>The direction for the film is decent and there is some interesting cinematography, namely in one classroom scene which provokes a suitably nauseating and disorienting experience for the viewer which puts us firmly in the shoes of one of the characters expertly. However, the cinematography and direction (at least from a visual standpoint) does not reach a ""great"" level of quality.<br/><br/>To conclude, I shall now talk about the subjective experience I had when watching this film. It is easily understood why so many people have such an endearment towards this film. Its message is simple. ""SEIZE THE DAY!"" is the Keating's mantra as he implores his students (and more importantly the audience) to make the most of their lives. It is a remarkably simple message, but it is one which is not readily appreciated in day-to-day life in modern society. It is easy to see why people are so affected by this film as they face the humdrum monotony of daily living.<br/><br/>I think a criticism which people have of this film is that some of the characters (namely the students) come across as quite pretentious. Whilst I can certainly see WHY people may have this perception, I don't think it is an accurate one. Mr Keating's ambition for the children is for them to be able to think for themselves, nothing more, nothing less. Mr Keating is helping the students start their journey to self-discovery but does not presume to hold the answers. Other than the issues I have with the conflicting ideologies (which I identified earlier in length) I feel that the film deals with its themes and subject matter adequately.<br/><br/>As the film's final scene highlights, there will be people who will be deeply inspired by this film and there will be those who will scoff and will deem it to be overly sentimental. I can appreciate the opinions of both in regards to this film but I think that, ultimately, there is enough quality in this film to justify the 7/10 rating from myself."
"ExpendableMan","7","10","17","8 October 2007"," Robin Williams invents a string of school movie clichés
","Best known for it's (in)famous 'oh Captain my Captain' sequence, Dead Poets Society's biggest problem is the clichés it invented for the high school movie drama. Today's jaded audiences might smirk at such examples as the shy boy finding the confidence to express himself through the help of a rebellious teacher, or the purity of youthful romance, but to the film's eternal credit, this was fresh ground after a decade of teen sex comedies. Dead Poets Society's teenagers aren't simply lust crazed hormone bags that wander into embarrassing social accidents every fifteen minutes, they're a tad more realistic...for most of the film at least. When the movie ventures into darker territory in the closing quarter it falters, becoming an awkward attempt at manipulating emotions that jars against the promising story told in the beginning.<br/><br/>Set in a prestigious school where the upper lips are stiff, the shirts stuffed and the emotions repressed, a class of teenage boys find their new English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) taking a slight detour from the established curriculum. Encouraging them to think outside the box rather than be restricted by school-approved guidelines, he not only provides them with a full appreciation and love of poetry, but also a fresh mindset that focuses on seizing the day and acting on impulse. Soon, the boys are exploring various avenues of life (one becomes an actor, another pursues a local girl etc...) while their parents look on disapprovingly and the identikit old-fashioned teachers with grey hair and suits start trying to interfere.<br/><br/>What is most striking about this whole enterprise is that despite its reputation, there isn't a laugh to be had anywhere. This is not a Robin Williams comedy-drama, it's just a drama and the comedian suits the role perfectly. He is convincingly charismatic and just sentimental enough to stop you from choking on your own vomit, this is Robin Williams the actor, not Robin Williams the clown. However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well. Hawke is probably the best, his tearful breakdown in a snow covered field being surprisingly effective, but they all hold their own against the more experienced actors.<br/><br/>Shame then about the closing part of the story. With a sudden about turn, the film changes from an account of the individual versus the machine into a teenage suicide yarn all too quickly. This wouldn't be a problem if more time had been taken, but the character involved seems to decide to kill himself with as much ease as the rest of us pick what to have for lunch at work. And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society therefore is ultimately a promise that wasn't completely fulfilled as the subtle, intelligent storytelling is blown out of the water by the mishandling of the closing scenes. Consequently, if you're anything like me, you'll spend most of the film trying to guess which kid pops his clogs. It's an enjoyable and involving drama, but as a tear-jerker it fails to move. Williams is excellent as always though and for seventy five percent of the time, Dead Poets Society is a great film."

","Dead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir (Picnic At Hanging Rock/Gallipoli) and stars Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Kurtwood Smith, Gale Hansen & Norman Lloyd. The script is written by Tom Schulman, based on his life at Montgomery Bell Academy, an all-boys preparatory school in Nashville, Tennessee. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings. Not bad considering this was the year that film lovers flocked to see the likes of Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and the third outing for one Indiana Jones. It showed that there was a mainstream market for serious drama if it is done well. And rest assured, Dead Poets Society is done well, very well in fact. Its launchpad is Schulman's Academy Award winning script that puts under the microscope educational conformity and the ogres that are parental and peer pressure. Enter the inspired casting of Robin Wiliams (nominated for BAFTA & Academy Award for Best Actor) as the teacher who urges his charges to see outside of the box that they have been placed in. Young men, soon to be full adults, who have their lives mapped out for them, are challenged by Mr Keating to be spontaneous, to pursue idealism and view life with new perspectives.<br/><br/>Coming two years after he was nominated for Good Morning Vietnam, Williams once and for all proves to his doubters that he is a quality dramatic actor. His Keating is charismatic but without the mad-cap histrionics that Williams is famed for. Very controlled, in that what is in essence a catalyst role, Keating hasn't rushed to become said catalyst. He's a constant sympathetic presence, a father figure type, yet a confidential friend too. That Schulman's script has avoided the usual clichés that come with teacher-student relations in film's helps Williams as an actor to breath intelligent life into Keating. Even the flecks of humour that Williams is allowed to work from, such as Brando doing Shakespeare, play with a warmth that's essential to the relationships forming in the piece. Tho it's unquestionably Williams' movie (the film soars when he is on screen), the young cast playing the students get an A + for their sensitive portrayals. Notably Robert Sean Leonard (heartfelt), Ethan Hawke (haunting) & Gale Hansen (punky). While Kurtwood Smith leaves an indelible image as a domineering father.<br/><br/>In the hands of Weir, the film, unsurprisingly to his fans, carries an air of mysticism too. Again working with one of his regular DOP's, John Seale, Weir knows how to capture the time, place and people in his movies; while cloaking them in dashes of mystical beauty. Be it the boys striding around the school grounds amidst autumnal hues, or plodding wearily thru the snowy terrain as Winter kicks in, Weir gives the scenes an apt poetic quality. It's also of note that these scenes, as well as the cave sequences where the Dead Poets Society meetings take place, blend with the characters emotional states. Sprightly and optimistic around the greenery, nervous and excited in the darkened cave, then heavy of heart and leg as the fall accompanies the emotionally turbulent last quarter. A last quarter that leads to what has now become a divisive ending. Some have (and will) come away from it irked and claiming it to be syrupy. Others such as myself find it uplifting, hopeful and a fitting end to the emotional roller-coaster that cast and crew have taken us on. Is your glass half full or half empty? An excellent and intelligent story is directed and acted accordingly, with its themes making it actually one of the best Punk Rock movies out there. 9/10"

","Dead Poets Society is one of the few films that are hard to forget once watched. This film is an influential film that is capable of changing how we see reality and life. It's about an extraordinary English teacher named John Keating, who uses unique ways through literature and poetry, to teach his students about life. He once said in the film, ""We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering  these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love  these are what we stay alive for."" The film was opened in a well known prestigious Welton Academy which was an all-boys prep school. The school was popular for its four principles: tradition, honor, discipline and excellence. There was a group of friends which was consisted of: Neil Perry, Todd Anderson, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks and Gerard Pitts.<br/><br/>Neil Perry was a student that excelled in many subjects in school. He did everything that his father wanted him to do. When Mr. Keating told him to seize the day and to live an extraordinary life, he defied his father's wishes. He followed his dream, acting on stage, which was not approved by his father. He was pulled out of the school. He wanted to tell his father his own decisions but, he did not succeed and opted to commit suicide using his father's gun.<br/><br/>Todd Anderson was a shy boy. He had an older brother who also studied on the same school. That's why he needed to live up to his reputation. He also thought that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing. Mr. Keating proved him wrong, he told him that he knew that something inside him was worth a great deal. And from that day on, his life was heavily influenced and changed.<br/><br/>Knox Overstreet was a persistent guy. He met a girl named Chris and instantly fell in love with her. He desired to see her after their first encounter. Later on, he realized that Chris already had a boyfriend. Yet he persisted in courting her. He didn't care if he gets punched or humiliated. He used poetry in wooing Chris. He even said ""She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will hate me. My parents will kill me. All right, goddamn it. You're right. Carpe diem. Even if it kills me."" Charlie Dalton was a rebel and a dare devil. He did anything that pleased him. He once took his personal freedom too far and published an article that proposed girls to be allowed at Welton to give the boys some pleasure. The authorities learnt of it and interrogated Charlie. Charlie told them that he acted alone. Later in the story, he changed his name to Newanda.<br/><br/>John Keating is an extraordinary teacher. He used unusual teaching methods that any other ordinary teachers won't approve of. He taught outside the classroom, tried different approaches and ensured that it was not boring. He hated the idea of learning literature by doing scales of quality and popularity ratings. Instead, he ensured that his students learned to stretch their minds, to think for themselves and to exercise their own rights to defy acts of love for literature and life. He simply was a one of a kind and an amazing teacher.<br/><br/>One of the things that John Keating emphasized was ""Carpe Diem"" which meant seize the day, make your lives extraordinary. He showed his students a picture of former Welton students in a trophy case. He explained that they were once like them. Each one of them was full of their own hopes and dreams. Only they themselves knew if they made their lives extraordinary since these alumni are now dead.<br/><br/>This made the group of friends revive an old literary club called the Dead Poets Society. Neil Perry once read ""I went to the woods to live deliberately, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, and not when I came to die, that I had not lived."" This simply tells us that being a member of the Dead Poets Society meant that they have decided that they won't be held as captives by their fathers or anyone else anymore. They will decide on their own and do thing that they want to do. Nobody can stop them, not even death. What matters is that they followed their own paths. This would be the only way for them to experience everything that life has to offer; everything that they had not experienced when they were enslaved from their parent's expectations and other people's standards. And when death swallows them up, they can say that they had truly lived an extraordinary life. They had seized the days."

"paul2001sw-1","5","24","50","25 April 2006"," Dead Portents Society
","Any film about any sort of greatness faces one particular challenge: how to depict that greatness. For example, to write a great film about a great poet, would you also need to be able to write great poetry? In fact, 'Dead Poets Society ' is a film about not a great poet, but an (allegedly) great teacher (Keating, played by Robin Williams), but the problem is still the same: can you convince the viewer that your character is truly inspiring, and not just irritating? But the fact that I am unimpressed with the teaching methods of the film's hero is only the first of a number of problems I have with this movie. Another is that the hero urges his students to seize the day, and to make the most of their lives, but all he seems to have done with his own life is to become a teacher to some of America's most privileged schoolboys. The generally unfair phrase, ""those who can, do; those who can't, teach"" actually seems apt in this case. And why should the audience care so much whether these boys, already blessed with every advantage, are inspired to achieve even more than than they would be otherwise? Then there's the issue about how they are actually inspired. All we see happen is a group of exceptionally docile teenagers acquire one quarter the rebelliousness, but ten times the pretentiousness, of any normal adolescent: yet we're apparently supposed to take this as an event of great import. Then one of the boys commits suicide for reasons that bear no relationship to anything that is consistent with modern psychological theories of suicide (that suicide is a symptom of mental illness: but here the character kills himself while of completely sound mind). Finally, the end of the film has echoes of Spartacus but in ludicrously less significant circumstances: are we really meant to be so upset that (however unjustly) a teacher has been sacked from his job? And it maybe doesn't even seem so unjust, not that he is really responsible for the death, but because the film has never shown him teach his classes anything but attitude; and moreover, we see him teaching only a single class in the entire movie, so there's never any sense of his wider life in the school. Director Peter Wier manages the whole piece with the same sort of stylised, refined sensibility also present in his 'Picnic At Hanging Rock'; but at times this seems ludicrous, such as when the class watches a pretty amateur performance of 'A Midsummers Nights Dream' with something close to rapture. In conclusion, this is an irksome film, whose unsubtle message is ""think for yourself"", but which doesn't actually leave the audience much freedom to do this for themselves."

This review is written by a boy who also finds himself on the edge of adolescence and adulthood, does that mean I'm biased, absolutely, but everyone who watches this film is, everyone can relate.

Conformity is easy, conformity is comfortable, conformity gets you good grades, trust me you're listening right now to a past perfect GPA teacher's pet. The thing conformity doesn't give you though, is a life, one worth living. For something to be beautiful it must also have a side of danger, and that's what freedom of thought is, as is mentioned in the movie ""we must constantly look at things in a different way,"" and that's beautiful! Yes, it means at times we don't agree, yes it means you might give this movie a 4/10 but I'll be damned if that changes my opinion of it.<br/><br/>The themes this movie explores such as, never letting a moment slip by where you don't think for yourself, where you don't seize an opportunity, it does so beautifully. Robin Williams was not acting he was believing, everything in this movie comes across as genuine, a slice of reality, a harsh but beautiful one at that.<br/><br/>Will I watch this movie again, I don't think so.

","A thoughtful, moving, uplifting film, Dead Poets Society is about a teacher's relationship with his students, and how he helped them to grow and have a better quality of life through poetry.<br/><br/>The performances were mostly strong all around, with the central characters being surprisingly solid and well-fleshed out for such young actors. The camaraderie between the boys was nice and believable, I thought they portrayed their friendship realistically. Robin Williams steals the show in every scene he's in, and I don't think he ever got his due as a dramatic actor. Sure he's a great comedy actor, but this and <a href=""/title/tt0119217/"">Good Will Hunting (1997)</a> cement his obvious dramatic talent for any doubters. He too is believable in his role, and he develops a believable relationship with his students.<br/><br/>Is Peter Weir not one of the greatest directors out there? He has such a good body of work, and his dramatic style and look are ever present here. I can't quite describe the feel of his films, but it's there. If you enjoyed <a href=""/title/tt0090329/"">Witness (1985)</a> or <a href=""/title/tt0311113/"">Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)</a> of the World, than you'll appreciate this effort from Weir. It may be his best film.<br/><br/>The movie's message and philosophy are admirable, too. The goal of taking every moment and living life instead of letting time slip away is important, and the emotional story surrounding the teacher's relationship with his students and how if affected their relationships is also moving and well-structured. The aspect of people being brought closer together through art and an appreciation of it is also interesting. Some may argue that non-conformity was the message, and that the film's ending goes against that, but I think non-conformity and defending one's own beliefs was displayed in the ending, and non-conformity is only part of the overall point anyway.<br/><br/>I definitely can recommend this, though many have seen it already anyway. It's definitely one of Williams' best performances, and Weir's best films. If you ever needed inspiration to read poetry, this is the best place to start."

","In the fall of 1987, filming had already begun at Berry College, Rome, Georgia. Berry had a set of very old buildings that were designed to look like the buildings at Oxford College in England. These buildings had attracted many filmmakers before. When I visited that fall, they had gone to great lengths to make it look like a more north eastern college, making the trees and landscaping appear in later stages of autumn. We were all very excited, despite the strange name of the movie they were filming - Dead Poets Society.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they changed their mind. They decided to scrap all the footage the were shooting at Berry College, and move production to a different school. I didn't realize they had changed locations until I went to see the film after its release. I went with high expectations but all I could do was look at the buildings and background and think, ""That's not Berry.""<br/><br/>So even though it was a great film, I still lament that Berry College was dropped and another school chosen, and that Berry does not go down in history as the location where Dead Poets Society was filmed."

"frankwiener","8","2","2","18 April 2020"," I Not Only Seized the Day, I Became an English Major
","My best teacher in high school and my favorite professors during my first couple of years in college taught English. Even without their heavy influence on my highly pliable mind at the time, English was my favorite subject, so I not only ""seized the day"", but I seized the whole subject as my major. That was a much greater commitment to the dead poets than the highly privileged young men at Weldon Academy ever even dreamed about. Coming from a lower middle class family and completing twenty years of formal education entirely in the public system with virtually no connections anywhere, I decided that I didn't want to teach or pursue the law profession, and the world decided that I didn't have the talent to earn a living as a writer or even as an editor of actual, able writers. I had seized much more than the day, but where the heck was I in terms of the ""real"" world, especially when those pesky bills started arriving for food, rent, insurance premiums and the like?<br/><br/>I am in no way defending the narrow-minded oppression and rigidity of education at Weldon Academy, but having experienced what I have in life, there is something to be said for a practical education that prepares one well for the cold reality of what follows the world of classrooms and blackboards. There must be a middle ground somewhere. Just don't ask me where it lies. If you passionately love science, math and information technology, you will never understand what I'm even talking about. Lucky you! In the end, I was forced to pursue another degree that was easier to utilize in the world in which we live, whether we approve of it or not. That having been said, I loved my years as an English major, and I obtained an education that no other subject could have provided me. The problem was landing on my rear end on the day after graduation in an economically wounded post-Vietnam War era when no one was even remotely interested in my essays on the works of William Butler Yeats.<br/><br/>As one who seized far more than just a day, I truly appreciate this film. I can't recall any movie featuring Robin Williams that I ever disliked, sometimes only because of his presence and not because of the rest of the movie. There is no need to describe the terrible circumstances of his end, which are so very sad to all of his fans, including me. In order to appreciate this film fully, one had to be alive in the highly conformist world of 1959, the year in which it occurred. I so despise the character of Mr. Perry, Neil's status obsessed father, not only because I have unfortunately known so many men and women like him in my life and because he alone drove his son to his tragic end but because he failed to acknowledge for even a moment his own responsibility in Neil's death and instinctively shifted the entire blame to the school and specifically to Mr. Keating, his unfortunate scapegoat. Who hasn't painfully witnessed this despicable behavior in real life? Kurtwood Smith played the part perfectly, as did Hitchcock veteran Norman Lloyd in the role of the headmaster, and all of the actors who played the young men were also good. I credit the overall performance of such a young cast and much more than that to director Peter Weir (""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", ""Gallipoli"", ""Witness"", just to name a few). The sequences of the guys moving through the fields in and around the real St. Andrew's School in Delaware were beautifully filmed."

"truemythmedia","8","2","2","6 November 2019"," Oh Captain, My Captain.
","Long before I had seen this film I knew of the most famous scene, that being the ""Oh, captain, my captain"" scene, and I've seen the phrase 'Carpe Diem' scribbled on whiteboards ever since I was a wee little lad in grade school. This film was ingrained in our culture before I entered the world (I know, I'm so young!), so I've never known a world without the ideas presented by so brilliantly and succinctly by John Keating (Robin Williams, ""The Fisher King""). If I had seen this film probably ten years ago, during the days of my youth when I was still searching for authors who could better put into words how I felt about the world, this film probably would've been a five star movie for me, but now, in the post-#Me Too era there are a few issues that come to light, and I also found there was a bit too much melodrama in the third act for my taste.<br/><br/>As a whole however, this film is a wonderful work of art that has themes that I so agree with that I could sing about them from the top of a mountain. I've often quoted Franz Kafka on the TMM Podcast, specifically one of his more famous quotes, which is: ""A book must be an axe for the frozen sea inside us,"" meaning that good fiction should chip away at us, soften us, make us reconsider our own thoughts and ideas... I think that the same quote could be ascribed to films as well (or any art form, for that matter). Great films challenge me, and this film tries its darndest to do just that. I think this film that, thirty years after its release, just falls short of being Peter Weir's masterpiece (you just can't beat ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", in my opinion)."

","I recently saw the movie. Its meaning is still timeless, and produces strong emotions. Follow your dreams, passions, and, goals, be ambitious, keep trying and never stop believing in pure values and standards. It means a lot to have someone in your life to teach you this valuable lesson. For me it was a professor as well. So the movie did affect me a lot.<br/><br/>It's sad though that it still captures today's society. Things haven't really changed. The necessity of expressing feelings is of high importance and can affect one's life. People still can't talk to their parents and seek mentors and advisors elsewhere, but the void is never filled. The educational system hasn't changed either. Education is more than just doing maths and physics. It's about creating character, find yourself and developing ideas. That's why students fadmire professors like Keating. They become more like mentors and their words stay with you forever.<br/><br/>Great movie, teaches valueble lessons."

","Dead Poets Society is a beautiful drama movie that won the Best Screenplay Academy Award in 1989. The movie was written by Tom Schulman and directed by Peter Weir. Tom Schulman is graduated in philosophy and because of this the screenplay presents important reflections about the life.<br/><br/>Robin Williams interprets John Keating, the new English teacher of a traditional school. The difference between John Keating and the other teachers of this school is the way he uses the English poetry to inspire his students to create and think by themselves. In the first class, he talked about ""Carpe Diem"", a Latin expression that means seize the day.<br/><br/>John Keating is an important character, but the students are the focus of the plot. The poetry change the relationship between themselves and their families. Some students who were oppressed by their parent plans and expectations stars to plan their own dreams and to live their own loves.<br/><br/>The Dead Poets Society is like an art and philosophy's manifest. It is a sensitive and necessary movie to be watched in nowadays. The utilitarian ideology doesn't recognizes the value of the poetry, the romance and the love, but these things give meaning and purpose to our lives, help us to see the world in a different way.

","'Dead Poets Society' is one of the top rated films of all-time and also happens to be a multi-award winning film, and its easy to see why. This is a truly remarkable film every parent, especially, should see. Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard are exceptional in their respective roles. In fact, the entire cast were very good, and notably also Ethan Hawke.<br/><br/>The love story between Knox and Chris felt forced and was annoying and seemingly out of place in this film. Yes, I understand the need to portray young love, since this is a coming of age film, but there was nothing romantic about them. I found it to be pure lust on Knox's behalf and Chris eventually fell for him for whatever reason. There is no chemistry whatsoever between them and the film would have been so much better without this love interest. Charlie Dalton's obsession with women was far more believable and (also) clearly lust, but suited the character and emphasized his personality.<br/><br/>Robin Williams played a very gentle, kindhearted character, always giving advice and putting everyone else's needs before his own. He not only captures the student's attention, but also the viewer's, as he is perceived as a caring, loving person and me as the viewer felt a sense of joy as he nurtured the boys, giving them hope and inspiration - not only on a poetic level, but on life itself. It was delightful to see the boys enjoy his class and looking forward to what he had to offer.<br/><br/>The unexpected ending shocked me to the core, for so many different reasons, and I won't spoil it for you. It caught me completely off guard. Although this is a film I probably won't watch again in a hurry (especially now that I know the ending) it definitely is a film worth viewing at least once."

"zkonedog","9","2","2","12 March 2017"," Only Clichéd Now Because It Is Such A Classic
","Sometimes a film can become clichéd due to sheer overexposure. Since Dead Poets Society came out in 1989, it has been used in nearly every English classroom in the United States at least once, I believe. As a result, it suffers from severe overexposure to the general public. However, as a viewer watching the film for the first time, I was not privy to the clichés, and thus enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on a prestigious East Coast preperatory school. The students at said school have their entire future planned out, and are under intense pressure to succeed. Introduced to this atmosphere is new professor John Keating (Robin Williams), whose teaching philosophy in equal parts rankles the traditional faculty, inspires his students, and forever changes the landscape of the institution.<br/><br/>This movie is groundbreaking in its portrayal of the teacher-student relationship. However, the true genius of the filmmaking is that the issues are presented in shades of grey, not black and white. Many situation are incredibly complex and have no concrete ""correct answers"", but this film valiantly tackles them anyway. It doesn't shy away from reality, and for that I am thankful, as too many films these days over-simplify real-life situations, leading to watered-down scenarios.<br/><br/>In terms of casting, Dead Poets Society is a cut above the rest. Williams is tremendous as the inspirational instructor, who isn't too over-the-top, but also injects the requisite amount of passion into the role. Both the professors and students at the prep school are also spot-on in their characterizations.<br/><br/>Thus, I highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't yet had the pleasure. It may be highly clichéd these days, but that is only because it has been around for so long. It truly is an amazing film that should only get better with time."

Out of all the movies I have watched in the short span of my life, this is by far the best one. Despite the fact that it is from the '80s it continues to inspire people all around the world.

Professor John Keating embodies a man that everyone wishes to have as a teacher, he dares to teach things that are more than what you normally hear in a classroom. He shows us the extraordinary, he teaches us how to live, how to feel and most importantly; how to be human. Then, we have Robert Sean-Leonard as Neil Perry, once more extremely underrated. His roles are always filled to the brim with inspiration and emotion. The entire supporting cast is amazing, they provide to the foundation of this movie, without them this movie would not have the same emotional impact.<br/><br/>This movie is a diamond in the rough.

","Revisiting Dead Poets' Society decades after first viewing, it is reassuring to see that it has not only lasted, but rewards with repeat viewing. A new English teacher at an elite boys' boarding school brings a maverick sense of teaching to the stuffy institution, injecting vitality into the life of some of the boys, while putting himself on a collision course with the school authorities. Great scenes abound: the walk in the courtyard to teach about the dangers of conformity, Tom's blindfolded poetry read, and the climactic tribute of the boys to their fallen captain, one of the greatest tear-jerkers in cinema. Look at Weir's angle and camera placement - absolutely perfect. His extreme wide shot of a grieving Tom in a snow landscape, and his silent depiction of Neil's demise, all attest to poetry in both script and mise-en-scene. Very few films are faultless, but there is not one word, shot, casting decision or any other element of this film that one would change. Outstanding cinema."

","Every school should have a teacher like Mr. Keating (Robin Williams). He is inspirational and teaches young men to think for themselves and look at life differently. If I'd had a teacher like that, I might have done better in school! For me, it's the theme of the story that is the most important. The acting performances are secondary. I've watched the movie about three times now, and I still find myself getting inspired - and getting a boost to my self confidence! Robin Williams is excellent in this type of role - in my opinion, I prefer his performances in drama rather than comedy.<br/><br/>This movie should be shown in all schools for 12-13 year olds. It's especially motivating for those who may lack confidence and are somewhat meek and mild. This movie gives them a voice. A teacher like Mr. Keating shapes the lives of young men and teaches them more than any classroom book can. It's a life affirming movie. I love the movie!"

","This was the first time I watch this movie. I will probably see this movie again. I recommend this movie to people in Korea because it's relevant in Korea's high pressure education system. The movie is a good antidote to the conformism in Korea. I'm sure young students like myself will find the movie quite inspiring.<br/><br/>Apart from the fact that it resonated with my own situation I can also say the acting is superb and the plot gripping.<br/><br/>It struck me too that the language in the movie is very engaging and encouraging for someone like me - a non-native speaker to go on developing my English skills."

","I will admit this first. I was never a huge Robin Williams fan. <br/><br/>But when I was in Year 10 the entire year level watched Dead Poets Society while we were learning about poetry. And and actually felt it wasn't a waste of time. <br/><br/>Later I acknowledged I had watched a truly great film. <br/><br/>With amounts of warmth, humor and drama, this is a film that remains up there as one of the best I have ever seen and that is saying something. Robin Williams, playing Mr. John Keating, shows that he can be a comedian and a superb actor as well, turning from comedic actor to serious actor numerous times. <br/><br/>Favourite part of the film was when Keating calls J. Evans Pritchard PHD's introduction to poetry was excrement and says to the pupils to rip out the entire introduction with the classic line; 'Be gone J. Evans Prichard PHD!'."

","In 1959 Delaware (as Vermont), charismatic poetry teacher Robin Williams (as John Keating) arrives to begin work at the ""Welton Academy"" preparatory school for boys. An alumni of the school, Mr. Williams teaches poetry with uncommon zeal. To gain attention, he demands students tear out the pages of books written by essayists with whom he does not agree. To get participation, he invites students to stand on the teacher's desk. Williams does impersonations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. His motto is ""Seize the Day,"" a directive made popular by novelist Saul Bellow. Yes, this class is fun...<br/><br/>Williams teaches the ""dangers of conforming,"" and encourages students to think for themselves. When they learn Williams belonged to a clandestine club called the ""Dead Poets Society"" when he was a ""Welton"" student, the class decides to revive the group. They meet in a cave to read poetry by the masters - but, mainly, they just goof around. Playing the saxophone and sharing ""Playboy""-type centerfolds accompany Walt Whitman. Because Williams'' influence extends perilously beyond the classroom, his ""unorthodox teaching methods"" get the popular teacher in trouble with school administrators...<br/><br/>This above average production won good notices and award consideration for director Peter Weir and star Robin Williams. Originally, the teacher held back a secret; ""Oscar""-winning writer Tom Schulman was persuaded to drop the idea, so we and the character are left with a gap. Williams' ""Keating"" is put on the sidelines in favor of the students. Nothing against the actors, who perform exceptionally, but they do look more like handsome young college-aged models than typical high-school aged boys. There is some physical diversity in the extended supporting cast, though. A few of the boys wear glasses...<br/><br/>The main stars are sensitive writer Ethan Hawke (as Todd Anderson) and his roommate, aspiring actor Robert Sean Leonard (as Neil Perry). The next tier includes prankster Gale Hansen (as Charlie Dalton) and lovelorn Josh Charles (as Knox Overstreet). Although these players are almost interchangeable, the actors create distinguishable characters. Best of the remaining parts goes to Dylan Kussman (as Richard Cameron), who perversely turns out to be the group's real non-conformist. The film is too self-consciously calculating and manipulative to be fully masterful, but it sure looks nice.<br/><br/>******** Dead Poets Society (6/2/89) Peter Weir ~ Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Gale Hansen"
"g-bodyl","9","2","2","22 June 2013"," Much Better Than Expected!
","Dead Poets Society is a much better film than I anticipated. Honestly, I thought this would be a film all about poetry and I loathe poetry, so I didn't give this film a chance. I'm glad I did because this is not a film about poetry, but about a group of college kids who have been encouraged to follow their own dreams. This film is a well-made drama that will make you smile, laugh, and cry. It also has one of the most unexpected scenes I have seen in awhile.<br/><br/>Peter Weir's film is about a group of college kids who are inspired by their English professor, John Keating. Keating tells his kids who follow their dreams and they do just that. Unfortunately, the dean and the parents have other ideas for their kids.<br/><br/>Robin Williams gives a true, inspirational performance as John Keating. He is the teacher that is common nowadays, but someone my parents would yearn to have. Ethan Hawke delivers a stand out performance as one of the kids and so does Robert Sean Leonard.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a truly inspirational film that has one simple message for all people, especially younger ones. This message is ""Follow our dreams and don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't do."" This message should have been used back in the 1950's-1960's. This film is well-acted, has great direction, and should leave a tear or two. I rate this film 9/10."
"melania-chaves03","Null","2","2","1 June 2013"," Inspiring and Life changing
","""Carpe Diem"": Seize the day. This is the lesson, John Keating, the English schoolteacher wants to convey to his students. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It helps people to face problems and live life as if there was no tomorrow. It teaches us how to enjoy every aspect of life and let nothing ruin what makes us really happy. It is not only entertaining, but it teaches a great life lesson, which is to think for ourselves and stand up for that in which we believe. It is incomparable with other movies and should definitely be watched by everyone. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards. It is from the genre of drama and although it is a 1989 movie, the picture is great and the movie is so stimulating and outstanding, the picture won't even be a problem. <br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1959 in the Welton Academy. In this school education is very strict and students are expected to behave in a highly educated and responsible manner. Several of the students have a different opinion regarding the school's education process. When the new teacher comes, everything changes. John Keating is an unconventional teacher who tells his students to tear out the pages of the books and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a different perspective. He introduces the boys to poetry and teaches them new philosophies about life. He encourages his students to follow their dreams, and to not follow what people expect them to do, but what makes them happy. <br/><br/>The characters in this film are so realistic; they create an impact in the audience. I hate movies with flat characters and in this movie the character development is really outstanding. Robin Williams plays an excellent job as the professor and interacts very well with the students. In his early life, Williams studied political science before studying theatre in the Julliard School. He later on performed in nightclubs where he was discovered for the role of Mork on the TV series ""Happy Days"". Another important character is Robert Leonard who plays the role of Neil Perry. He deserves acknowledgment and fame and is mostly known as Dr. James Wilson on House M.D. Ethan Hawke is another important character in the movie. He plays the role of Todd Anderson in the movie. Ethan was born on 6 November 1970 in Austin Texas. His acting career started as a mix of theatre work and a mix of serious and commercial movies. All of these actors play an excellent role in the movie. They create an exciting plot, and the move builds up perfectly. <br/><br/>At first the movie seemed kind of boring, but as I paid more attention and it advanced it was amazing. It tells a story that nobody should miss. I talks about courage, how we should fight for what we want, and to live life to the fullest. One of my favorite scenes was when the English teacher, Mr. Keating, tells the students to tear the pages of a book apart. In every scene he is an excellent teacher, he makes the class entertaining and the students learn more than you could imagine. They do not only learn about English and poetry, but they learn about life.<br/><br/>This movie is heartwarming; it has a full meaning, and is contains great poetry that has life lessons. I believe the most important lesson in this movie is to seize the day. This means to make out the most of each day, as if we would die tomorrow. This relates to doing what you like, what you enjoy the most in life. It is getting apart from what society expects from you, and doing what makes you happy. Another important lesson is to be you. We live in a society in which everyone expects something from you, but the most important thing is to be your own self. It will help in mental and spiritual growth. Challenging the status quo is another lesson. Change the way to see life, make a change in the world, in people. One last lesson is to stand up for others. This will not only be beneficial for the people you help but it will help you feel better. <br/><br/>I believe everyone who watches the movie should enjoy it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it but especially for people above 13 years. This is because someone younger than this will maybe not understand well the meaning of the movie and will think it is boring. I would rate the movie PG-13. <br/><br/>This movie is as great as the Oscar Winning movie ""The Help"". Both movies are delightfully different. In ""The Help"", as well as in ""Dead Poets Society"", the characters play an excellent role and the plot is entertaining and fun. Along the movie you will not get bored, it catches the audience's attention due to the fact that they treat interesting subjects. They are memorable movies, that once you watch them you will never forget the lesson and it will change your life. Both teach a wonderful lesson that everyone should take into account in their daily lives. <br/><br/>Rating 8.7<br/><br/>The criticizer of this movie is Melania Chaves. She is an eleventh grade student at Lincoln School, Costa Rica. She is seventeen years old and will graduate next year from high school. She enjoys watching movies and hanging out with her friends. Her hobbies are playing tennis, running, and playing piano. <br/><br/>Carpe Diem!"

","This movie came out during my second year of University. Although I was a business major, the Carpe Diem theme resonated so strongly with me that it has shaped my life. I am not sure Dead Poets would have the same impact if I saw it at any other time in my life, but my identification with the main characters (group of young men living in a dorm) drew me into the movie. After watching this movie, I had an unquenchable thirst for Emerson, Thoreau (Walden is amazing) and the other Transcendentalists. This is more than a movie - it is a philosophy that can shape a very meaningful life. I watch Dead Poets Society every so often to reconnect with the younger version of myself - when possibilities were limitless and youthful idealism governed my actions. <br/><br/>I am in my early 40's now and am passing on the Carpe Diem message to my 3 daughters."

","Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Norman Lloyd, and Alexandra Powers star in ""Dead Poets Society,"" a 1989 film directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman.<br/><br/>William plays an English teacher, John Keating, who comes back to his alma mater, an exclusive boys school, to teach. His teaching technique is very different from anyone else's. His focus is on encouraging students to find themselves by reading and writing poetry, to be individuals, and to know their own hearts, to see the world in a unique way, and to take risks - ""carpe diem."" One of the students finds Keating's old yearbook and learns he was part of something called The Dead Poets Society.<br/><br/>When he's asked about it, Keating says that he and some of his fellow students met in a cave and read poetry. Neil (Leonard) and his friends Todd (Hawke), Knox (Josh Charles), Gale (Charlie Dalton) and others form the club again, find the cave, and sneak out at night. They read, laugh, and joke.<br/><br/>The boys are inspired by Keating and, in their own lives, try to break out. Each has his own story but the main focus is Neil, whose dictatorial father is insisting that he become a doctor when in his heart, he wants to be an actor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the school doesn't exactly want students to think for themselves and neither do their parents. Problems arise due to Keating's unorthodox teaching methods and opening these kids' minds.<br/><br/>What a beautiful movie and what great imagery of birds flying free, the boys standing on their school desks and seeing the room from a different perspective, that idea of being ""up high"" used when Neil late at night looks out the window of his home.<br/><br/>The film is predictable, but that doesn't make it any less powerful. It's set in 1959, and yes, kids did what their parents told them to do, and if your parents didn't like your choice of career, you were discouraged from going into it. I know someone who wanted to have a career in the army; his parents flew to Germany to see him. The young man returned, became an attorney, and was never a good one, nor a very happy person. Someone else I know actually got a part on Broadway and her parents made her return to her home town. Yes, that kind of thing happened. If you're creative like Neil, you can't really suppress it - the soul cries out for something else.<br/><br/>Robert Sean Leonard, Wilson on ""House"" is very young here. He gives a marvelous performance. I've seen him on Broadway twice - he's a very serious and committed actor. Everyone is good in this well-cast film. Robin Williams absolutely shines as a warm, funny man who loves to teach and who believes teaching goes way beyond just the subject. He's just fantastic.<br/><br/>For me, anyway, there weren't a lot of surprises in this film, but I loved it. It was both uplifting and depressing - the school wants the students to meet the status quo, and Keating wanted them to fly. Today, it's still not easy being different."

","I just saw this movie in my band class because of testing and I can't believe I never heard of it before. This film has a great cast and right. People shouldn't have to go along with everybody if they have different dreams of their own. Neil, one the Free Thinker at school but Follower and home, wanted to become an actor but his jealous and controlling father gave him no other option. Todd, my favorite and a Fencer, isn't sure whether he wants to go along with what everybody is doing instead of following his heart and he is jealous of his friend Neil because he has trouble speaking in front of people and has a low self esteem. Yes, Cameron is a Follower who goes by the rules no matter what. The ruler he used to tear off the pages of his book is an example that he only goes by the rules and never bends them only if someone asks him to. Mr. Keening is my favorite character because he interacts with his students in such an effective way that gets them interested in the class. And the comments he says sometimes are just plain hilarious. I just like the overall message about Siezing the Day and that we are all worm food so why live our life according to how others want us to live them? We all like different passions and dislikes and shouldn't feel afraid to get out of our little fence of protection, safety, isolation, fear, or security. We must come out of our comfort zones to fully live. Being Alive is not just breathing and moving, it's living for what we believe in and acting on those beliefs accordingly. That is when we will truly make a difference."

","""Dead Poets Society"" is a movie that is enjoyable with just good acting and competent filmmakers at the helm.<br/><br/>John Keating arrives at Welton Academy in 1959, years after attending the school, as the new English teacher. He wastes no time making an impact on his students, saying ""Carpe Diem,"" or ""Seize the day"" to them. The pupils at first do not know what to make of Keating, who is not the usual Welton teacher. <br/><br/>After coming across a yearbook, a group of his students find out that Keating belonged to a club called the Dead Poets Society. Seeking answers, they confront Keating, and he reluctantly tells them about going to a cave not far from the school, and he and his fellow members recited and created poetry. Intrigued by what he heard, Neil Perry, the leader of the group, organizes a revival of the Dead Poets Society, and everyone agrees to attend. Later on, Neil finds an old poetry book on his desk. Upon opening it, he finds that it is Keating's copy of the book that was used at each meeting. The gang goes to the cave and spends the night there, immersed in poetry.<br/><br/>Keating has an impact on the boys in more ways than one. He tells them they are going to think for themselves, and to find their own voice. Several of the boys take that to heart. Meanwhile, Mr Nolan, the Academy's headmaster, has received word about Keating's teaching style. He approaches Keating about this, and wanting to put a stop to Keating's maverick methods, tells him to just prepare them for college and leave it at that. However, Nolan is already too late, for several of Keating's students have already decided to see what life is all about.<br/><br/>""Dead Poets Society"" features a talented ensemble cast. Robin Williams is great as Keating, in one of his best dramatic performances. Robert Sean Leonard (known to TV viewers as Wilson on House) are both good as Neil and Todd. And Kurtwood Smith, best known as Red Forman on ""That 70s Show,"" is well cast as Neil's stern and demanding father. The film is a story of a dedicated teacher, but it is also a coming of age tale. In addition, it is a study of conformity vs. non-conformity. It would have been interesting to see how the lives of the characters turned out during the 1960s, when the counterculture first came about. <br/><br/>This is a movie that you should watch. Don't miss it."
"Ampero","8","2","2","25 January 2010"," Brilliant Piece
","This movie, for one, is a real gem of character fruition. Set in the fictional Welton (Hell-ton) Academy for Boys we follow a few of its students and a new English teacher, Mr. Keating. One of the main themes, as propelled by Mr. Keating to the boys, is to grasp life as it is and not as it's expected and he does that through embedding an appreciation for poetry and the literary arts- not as mere text to adhere and memorize but as emotions and stories to feel. Through that Mr. Keating allowed the boys to get to know themselves and find where their passion lies, aside from what is expected of their future.<br/><br/>One of the main characters, Neil Perry, may have been the most influenced by this new perspective being taught and goes about to form a bastard version of the Dead Poets Society upon learning of it from Mr. Keating's past as a former student of Welton. This ushers in a flurry of self-discovery and adolescent rebellion as the boys find themselves building an appreciation for the arts and self-expression.<br/><br/>The villain of the movie lay with the school officials and some parents garnering the uppity appeal of authority and the 'right way' of things. The inevitable struggle with that and the boys was an awesome display of humanity as the Dead Poets Society is inevitably dismantled because of a tragic resolution of one of the characters. The process showed how selfish people can be in the face of doing the right thing as opposed to not getting chided for your own beliefs. The way it reflected how society conditions and discourages free-thinking is awesome, especially when the caged-bird syndrome is revealed with Neil Perry.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie, considering the ages of the characters was great. All the little nuances that you would expect from a group of teenage boys were there and they were, surprisingly, tolerable. We got to see a young Ethan Hawke, as Todd Anderson, flap his acting wings as the film's strong under-dog supporting character. The direction was great as well. The mood and the overall growth of the film was enough to put you into the world and root for the characters while not being too demanding or too taxing on the viewer. Robin Williams excelled in the dramatics of his role and it was a breath of fresh air to see him go to his comedic panache in the few moments that he did. Being a teen movie one would expect some elements of a love scene and it was there but not in the overwhelming sense for it to take away from the film, it merely supplemented the appreciation for passion and seizing the day – as was the general theme of the movie.<br/><br/>It's indeed a classic in its own right and one that should be watched at least once to make your life extraordinary. The life lessons scattered throughout will leave you feeling, somewhat, appreciative of the little things and will leave you chanting Carpe Diem or referring to a friend as 'Captain, My Captain.'<br/><br/>Standout Line: ""We don't read & write poetry because it's cute. We read & write poetry because we're human beings and we're filled with passion!"""

","Very touching drama about the moral value on which most of us sees as irrelevant.Dead Poets Society is no more, no less than a masterpiece, along with ""Back to the Future"" the best 80's creation, and another proof of Peter Wier's gigantic talent.<br/><br/>The story focuses on life experience, as seen from inside a group of students, an experience which radically changes, one they meet Mr. Keating, the new English teacher. With time, he encourages them to live the moment (carpe diem), to see beyond the materialism, the pleasures of adolescence and introduces them in the world of poetry and deep meanings. However, it seems not everyone appreciates the teacher's attempt, and problems don't cease to occur, in a very dramatic end, which leaves you with quite a bitter taste, I might add.<br/><br/>The acting was at its brightest. From Robin Williams I expected nothing less than impressive, because I've always considered him to be, one of the most skilled actors, here making no exception as Professor Keating, a sensitive man who experiences happiness through poetry, a sincere and altruist person who fervently wants to share his beloved passion with his much younger students.<br/><br/>The real surprise was the performance of Robert Sean Leonard (Wilson from House MD TV series ) impersonating Neil Perry, a boy who loves acting but can't follow his dream because of his father's wish, as if his opinion didn't count at all, as if his personality was literally caged. <br/><br/>This is actually the meaning of this title, the misery and suffering of not being able to do what you like most... even if that doesn't suit your parents. Dead Poets Society insists on the differences between people, shows us that what some brave people built with passion and warmth can be destroyed by others incompetence and primitivism.<br/><br/>The world imagined by Wier, to whom I sincerely thank for crafting this beautiful film, is a divided one, always in the middle of a twister,a hurricane or what any other word you can think of, a non-stop tiresome conflict of interests.<br/><br/>To conclude, Dead Poets Society, is a title of unique atmosphere, beautiful acting samples, and last but not least, masterly directing.

It takes a simple idea of making the most out of everyday and expands it to the nth degree, all the while reaching across to audiences of many kinds, from film critics to moviegoers to high school students to even Academy members! It talks about seizing the day, your life, and getting the most out of it, which is what you would expect. But it delves much deeper, revealing the challenges of seizing your life, especially growing up, the pressure on how you should live and on how you should follow, and the potential consequences of doing so. Yet at the same time, it shows you the benefits and how those benefits greatly outweigh those negative traits. And it does so in such an intriguing way. Each kid is different and well-developed yet all have some similarity. Robin Williams plays an amazing role as Mr. Keating (I always saw him as a more talented dramatic actor than a comedic one). Some have said that the story is unrealistic and a rehash of other student- teacher movies. But like the poetry in this movie, this is not about realism, this is about the message of seizing the day and making your world extraordinary. The way the movie does this is so unforgettable with the believable and grade-A acting from the students and Williams, the great camera shots, and the amazing theme and atmosphere, so much so that I can watch the entire movie just for those select scenes.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","2","2","30 September 2009"," Inspiring drama that evokes memories of learning and self-discovery
","""Dead Poets Society"" is a maturing into adulthood drama whose story and messages are as instructional as they are inspiring. The film is like an inspirational teacher, the one in high school that changed the way you thought about life and knowledge. It reflects this in Mr. Keating, the teacher who touched the lives of a group of teenage boys for the better despite the monstrous obstacle of conformity in all their paths.<br/><br/>Directed by Peter Weir (""Gallipoli"") and written beautifully by Tom Schulman, ""Dead Poets Society"" stars Robin Williams in one his first great dramatic performances as Keating, an English teacher at an all-boys boarding school who inspires his students with poetry and by encourages their own free thinking with the simple motto of ""carpe diem (seize the day).""<br/><br/>But the film is really about the boys and their various struggles. Todd (Ethan Hawke) is quiet and keeps to himself -- he's scared of personal expression. Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) is living in the iron grip of his father (Kurtwood Smith) who insists he become a doctor when his passion is really acting. Knox (Josh Charles) discovers infatuation/love and the courage it requires and Charlie deals the barriers of free speech. Keating's lessons inspire their actions and bring out new parts of themselves and together they hold Dead Poets Society meetings in a cave in the woods.<br/><br/>The clique of rebellious teenage boys and their unusual teacher are not motifs foreign to film, and neither are themes of fighting conformity and making the most of life. Most adults know all about these ideas -- they're not exactly profound and original -- but Tom Schulman tells ""Dead Poets Society"" in such a way that allows you to rediscover them and reawaken memories of what that personal experience was like. We see the rigid culture and system of the school and the classroom and then suddenly Keating comes in and makes learning what it should be. Suddenly we remember who our ""Keatings"" were and what it was like when we finally learned the value of our own perspectives, ideas and most importantly, desires.<br/><br/>The cast of young men is excellent. They make sure no character entirely falls into a teenage stereotype despite their many personalities that make up the group dynamic. We remember our own youthful enthusiasm through their experience and empathize with their troubles.<br/><br/>Weir's direction leads us gracefully into this rediscovery. His use of symbolism and the subtle ways he re-implants elements of the classroom scenes into the students' subplots and other key moments of the film draw us back to the power of the learning experience and how it can leave such a fine imprint on our lives. We see clearly how those scenes with Keating give life to the rest of the story and rekindle our memories and ignite our emotions as we connect to the characters and their experiences.<br/><br/>""Dead Poets Society"" is a great execution of a simple inspirational drama/tragedy. Despite having all the elements, it avoids cliché much of the time or at least masks it with the strong connection the story builds with its audience. Many films have been more dramatic or original, but this film really gets the most out of what it is and tells a story about something universally human to which every soul with even the slightest meaningful education experience can relate. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

","Dead Poets Society is a fascinating drama about literature, friendship, growing up and pursuing independence. Its charisma lies in a great script and an unobtrusive directing which allows the cast - mostly young actors lead by the remarkable Robin Williams - to give out heartfelt performances.<br/><br/>Professor John Keating (an obvious allusion here) returns to his school to teach his class literature. His students are normal teenagers, wrestling with the usual insecurities about love, their purpose in life and standing up to their parents for their share of independence. They think he's just another teacher, but rather than teaching great literature, he teaches them to think for themselves.<br/><br/>In his student years, Keating had belonged to a student group called Dead Poets Society which celebrated poetry and life. Taking inspiration from this, some of his students resurrect the old group and begin discovering life for themselves.<br/><br/>Although Robin Williams is the center of the movie, he never dominates it. His presence is felt as ideas that influence the students. But it's them that make the movie shine, as we follow their lives. It's a great collection: there's Todd (a young Ethan Hawke) who's struggling with shyness; there's Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who decides he wants to be an actor; there's the wild Charlie, or rather ""Nuwanda"" (an unforgettable performance by Gale Hansen); and the love-struck Knox (Josh Charles).<br/><br/>Another interesting idea in this movie is that no one every likes the idea of letting young people thinking for themselves. School is seen here as a place to train people for the future, not to teach them to think critically; of course if that's not thought at school, when will there be time? Keating upsets the status quo and when a tragedy occurs he's a suitable scapegoat. Not everyone appreciates new ideas and change. The denouement is one of the strongest I've seen in any movie.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is a fantasy: in an ideal world, teachers would be cool and fascinating; and students would be receptive to knowledge and daring. As it is, this movie remains an alternative to our world full of conformity and tedium."

We are mortals, and we never know till when we shall live and must make the most of each moment and enjoy it. <br/><br/>The movie propagates the message of 'Independence- in thoughts and actions'. It is not just the script which has the power, but the direction, acting and other aspects in the movie are just beyond words. One may say the movie is about poetry. For me it(poetry) is a medium and an expression used in the movie, to convey the message of celebrating life, being free. I salute to all the Dead Poets, the world over !!!<br/><br/>Watch this movie at least once. You will surely enjoy it."
"kyle-cruse","8","2","2","17 September 2008"," Sad, though quite inspirational
","I generally find great inspiration in films like this, and ""Dead Poets Society"" is no exception. Robin Williams stars as a professor who encourages his students to ""make your lives extraordinary."" This ends up causing some of the students to go too far in this direction, resulting in the ""sad"" elements of this film. I did, however, feel a sense of encouragement in what Williams says, realizing that we've only got one life in this world and should make it something great. The scenes with Williams are superb, some of the best dialogue you will ever hear, in this film that won an Oscar for its screenplay. Williams was robbed of an Oscar here, though he later won one for the similar film he appeared in ""Good Will Hunting."" Though I like ""Good Will Hunting"" even better, I truly enjoyed this film. The one thing I felt it lacked was enough scenes with Williams and his students. Too many scenes feature the students off on their own in their club, or getting in trouble with other students or their parents, scenes that can get depressing when there are so many of them. Fortunately, Robin Williams comes around often enough the lighten things up a bit, though this is considered one of the first of his more serious roles. The ending scene is great, as is the one with Williams telling the students to rip out part of their textbook. A nicely-done, inspiring film. Not perfect, though it is still quite good.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","I know a lot of the people who gave this a low rating are teenagers who watched this in English class, but I was told by my English teacher to go out and watch this movie, and when I saw it on TV the other night, I started watching.<br/><br/>This is, I can honestly say, one of the best movies I have ever seen in my short 15 years. It was beautifully done, and very inspiring to watch. I am so thankful for the recommendation. The plot was captivating, and I was completely mesmerized. I am a huge fan of the show House, and seeing Robert Sean Leonard in one of his earlier acting careers only made me love him more; his character was wonderfully portrayed. Robin Williams' character was equally great to watch.<br/><br/>Someone advised teachers not to make their students watch this movie, and I think that that's a shame; but probably true. There are probably only like, four kids who will take the movie seriously and understand the depth of it, while the rest will sit around make jokes about it all day..."

","I saw ""Dead Poets Society"" for the first time last night. It was magical.<br/><br/>Every character, played to perfection by all actors, was very impressionable and very...real. Yes, they're poetic nerds, but it was still so easy for me to connect with not just one, but all of them. I understood their emotions and reasoning, and at the end of the movie, felt inspired ""to seize the day"". It really left me feeling that way.<br/><br/>Some people might feel like the end scene is a bit corny, but to me, it didn't feel corny, thankfully. To be honest, I wasn't 100% satisfied with the end, but I wasn't disappointed either. The majority of the film is light-hearted and easy-going, but it certainly does get darker and slightly depressing when it reaches the climax. The film doesn't feel as great in the aftermath of the climax, to me, since its really different from the rest of the film, but its not clichéd, and it still feels very real. But it just kind of puts the ""carpe diem"" thing to the side and replaces it with darkness, which is out of place. But that's what happens in real life.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, the power of the movie leaves you dazzled and inspired. I never felt more inspired and joyful at the end of a movie; this movie is that good. I don't know if I would say its one of the greatest films ever if you look at it from a technical and analytical point of view, but it is one of my favorites. Seize the day. How? Watch this film.

","This film really has moved my general opinion of life. Great actors' work and what a message to give! The first time I saw the film ""Dead Poets Society"" was as a school project, and I became rather interested in the concept, nothing more at the time. I delivered my paper and thought nothing of the film until it was on television 2 years later. Now, during these years, I had practically done nothing with my life and was kind of depressed but as I saw this movie again, I was astonished. I cried at the end etc. etc. and really went into a big think. The next couple of weeks, I did some ""wild"" things to just feel that I was living, and I actually began acting, got a tattoo on my arm that says ""Carpe Diem"" to remember me of my duty to get the best of life, and to get that today, and every day. To never count on tomorrow. Since I saw that movie, I have had nightmares of me lying as a 85 year old man, ready to die, thinking ""man, what have i actually done with my life. It's too late to do something about it now"". Anyway, no matter how you live your lives, I respect it, as long as you do, just what you really want to do :) Carpe Diem everyone"

","Upon watching Dead Poets Society, I was truly touched - tears were brought to my eyes with the heart rendering tale of friendship, coming of age, death and loss. Robin Williams cements this film with his portrayal of John Keating, an inspirational English teacher who invokes his students to seize the day and live life, however within the confines of a strict conservative elitist academy - which bodes well for the adversarial route that emerges between Keating and the Institution. In short, it was truly wonderful, OK it's not raw and brimming with realism, however this is not what this film attempts to do - a pure gem with a fantastic cast, I would definitely recommend it."

","I couldn't remember when I saw the film the first time, it's years ago now, but I fell in love with this movie. I fell in love with the poetry, I fell in love with the characters, the story, the beautiful music and pictures. I always wish I had such an inspiring teacher like Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams) And I always wish I found such nice boys out there. The ending is so powerful. This movie gave me so often the strenght to carry on when I'm down. All actors did a great, great job. Don't believe the critics! The movie is not perfect, OK. But I don't know a perfect movie anyway. This movie was wrong interpreted so often. Especially the suicide of one of the boys. But if you look carefully you see there is an answer against all the points which are criticized. For example: It's not true that there are only bad adults in this movie. I divide into the opinion that Neil's father is the reason why he kills himself. Neil's father want the best education and the best job for his son. He couldn't show his love - and he loves his son - in a better way. He never wanted that this happened. The way he treat his son make Neil so desperate that he thinks his only way out is to kill himself. Maybe it's the fact that I hate authority for me conformity is a very bad thing. Therefore for me it's not intolerant that they have to rip out the meaning of Mr. Dr. of Philosophy because it is true, you couldn't judge poetry and art in general like charts. Everybody who believe this deserves to be ripped out of a book, because a person thinking in such small boxes is the one person which is really intolerant. Keating tell the boys that it's good to be a lawyer, doctor or something like this. He don't't want them to be romantics. But he also told them that beauty and love gave a meaning to this life. So if you haven't seen this movie until yet go and get it and make up your mind, follow your own thoughts, even if the others think you are a jerk, but also be open for a different view and that's really the message Keating wants to taught the kids and more important than the beautiful poetry which is a bigger part of the movie than some people say."

","DEAD POETS SOCIETY, in my opinion, is an excellent Robin Williams film. Despite the fact that Keating (Robin Williams) was funny, his antics were a little unorthodox. The first time I ever saw this was in English class during my senior year of high school. After seeing it then, I decided I liked it. However, I didn't buy it on VHS until a year or so later. If you ask me, the most memorable quote is, ""Carpe Diem!"" In case you're wondering, that's a Latin phrase. Before I wrap this up, I must say that the performances were top grade. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Robin Williams or Ethan Hawke, you're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so see this movie today."

It's also one of two movies I saw in a class that I liked (the other one being one of the movie versions of ""Lord of the Flies"").

"AE_BS_CH","2","37","85","17 February 1999"," Unquestioned totalitarianism
","Actually, the topic of this film could be quite interesting. Its narrative, as I view it, is characterised by the move from bad to worse. It offers considerable psychological insight into how easily students, in a very strictly ordered environment that gives them very little freedom, can fall pray to a kind of sectarian leader who demands that they worship him as their 'captain' and lose the sense of reality.<br/><br/>Two very different faces of totalitarianism are contrasted in a very interesting way. In principle, it should not matter that much that this is probably not what was intended.<br/><br/>Dostoyevski, for instance, was a staunch conservative who propounded a conservative nationalist and religious ideology, which did not prevent him from writing novels that show an astonishing variety of ideological and philosophical topoi. Therefore, it should not matter that much that, as it seems, the totalitarian action of the teacher was probably intended as a positive contrast to the strict order that is there at the college. But, in my view, in this case, the ideological purpose nevertheless affects the quality of this film. It is good for provoking thought about sectarian totalitarianism, but that's all. The pervasiveness of the ideological purpose dominates the whole story so much that most of the interesting qualities of the situation get lost.<br/><br/>I would say that this is a most typically American film, in the slightly derogatory sense this word often has to Europeans when used in cultural issues: It is dominated by ideas, such as freedom, but the words remain empty, devoid of liveliness, and there is not the slightest hint of the idea that flight from authoritarian order could mean something else than following a sectarian leader. I do not object to depicting such bleakness in movies, and it must probably be regarded as an achievement of this film that it can produce such repulsion in people who are not familiar with this kind of authoritarian society, but the bleakness is disguised in such a nice and kitschy American stereotypes, such as striving for freedom, that I find it just bad taste."
"pinetarrag","1","64","159","24 July 2009"," Oy. Be open-minded, think like me!
","I hate this movie. It tells the story of a English professor who makes an an impact on his student and challenges them to take on the ""man"" , in this case their private school. The problem is that the teacher is treated as a angel who can do no wrong, even when he encourages his students to rip out pages of a book because he didn't agree with the author's opinions. ""Be open-minded, unless you disagree with a person."" seems to be be his message.<br/><br/>The movie is heavy handed. All of the people who dislike the teacher are members of the ""oppressive"" leadership of the school, with the exception of the turncoat student who, as another reviewer points out, is given lines that make him look like a Neo-Nazi. Everyone who likes the teacher is good everyone who disagrees bad. Sorry the world does not work that way, sometimes bad people support good leaders, and vice versa. There was also the suicide of a student, which was not integral to the plot, and therefore seems like a pointless development, except to make the audience feel for the kid and therefore the teacher. Using a death seems like a manipulative trick on behalf of the filmmakers. Don't fall for the filmmakers' tricks. This movie is not inspirational , it is deceiving, and overbearing with it's supposed message of freedom."
"majikstl","2","54","132","7 March 2004"," Poetic injustice
","There is a scene early in DEAD POETS SOCIETY wherein Robin Williams, as a new literature teacher at an upscale boys prep school, tells his class that he wants them to learn to think for themselves. To this end, he orders them to tear out of their text books pages which feature commentary by the book's editor. ""Think"" he seems to be saying, ""but first, let me censor this book."" <br/><br/>Free thought through censorship? I can only assume the said literature book includes Orwell's ""1984.""<br/><br/>In Orwellian fashion, hypocrisy is the order of the day in DEAD POETS SOCIETY. It gives a rousing, inspirational sermon (""Seize the day!"" is the teacher's motto.), yet the story itself mocks the film's supposed intentions. DEAD POETS SOCIETY is about failure, but it won't admit it; worse, it seems to believe it's own inspirational PR. The film serves up a tacked on and utterly false moment of triumph at the end, but everything that proceeds that is a lesson in failure. Williams fails to teach the students to show moral courage. One student commits suicide rather than fight for his beliefs. When Williams is wrongly accused of something, his supposedly adoring students turn on him like a pack of weasels. The one student who stands up for his ideals is expelled from the school and forgotten by the film. A father fails his son. The school fails its students. And the film fails its audience.<br/><br/>Yet, for some inexplicable reason, people remember the film for its inspirational message: Seize the day! Carpe Diem! Fine words, but at no time are they supported by the empty pessimism that the film displays. The characters who do take chances are immediately and soundly punished. Those who knuckle under -- showy, petty acts of deviance aside -- plod along.<br/><br/>
Williams is okay as the teacher, but all credibility is lost when he stops to toss in imitations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. Robert Sean Leonard comes off best as the doomed student, though his suicide seems remarkably undermotivated. Kurtwood Smith offers up a wholly unconvincing stereotype as the doomed student's martinet father. <br/><br/>Thanks to Peter Weir's efficient direction and some nice cinematography, DEAD POETS SOCIETY has a facade of class; but only if you don't pay too close attention to Tom Schulman's dreadful (though Oscar-winning) script. The irony is that a film that begs you to think is best enjoyed if you don't."
"Hancock_the_Superb","6","13","26","3 March 2007"," Good film damaged by melodrama/heavy-handedness
","At the exclusive Weldon Academy in post-WWII New England, boys are expected to go to school, grow up, conform, survive school, and contribute to society. But along comes Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), a flamboyant teacher who thinks that school should teach students how to live their own lives, and he teaches a most unconventional class, getting the students to love and celebrate poetry and the arts. Unfortunately, one of his students, Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), has his dreams of being an actor shot down by his overprotective father (Kurtwood Smith), and is driven to suicide - leading to the inevitable showdown between the teacher and the school.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Yes, this is a pretty clichéd plot, especially twenty years later; the setting and characters are right out of ""A Separate Peace"", a similarly overwrought novel about conformity vs. individualism at a private school, and about five hundred other movies and novels. Pretty much any high school/college student, and even most adults, could probably appreciate its moral: be yourself and go against the grain if necessary. The story does get some mileage out of this fact; a lot of what it gets right is also due to the fine cast, particularly Robin Williams. But overall, the film is a mixed-bag at best; not ruined, but certainly hampered by the heavy-handed way in which its issues are handled.<br/><br/>The film excels in period detail, and director Peter Weir deserves credit for being able to create an oppressive tone in the scenes at the academy; except, of course, the brilliantly lit classroom of Mr. Keating. The '50s were a time of conformity, a decade in which individuality was muted in favor of community, and so setting the film in that time period adds additional resonance to the story.<br/><br/>However, ""Dead Poet's Society"" stumbles occasionally, and its inclusion of predictable melodrama dampens its effect somewhat. The romance between student Knox (Josh Charles) and a local girl (Lara Flynn Boyle) seems tacked on and adds nothing to the story. The relationship between Neil and his parents is somewhat forced and obvious, and his lengthy suicide sequence is overlong and lacks the emotional power it could have had. And the film really sputters in its ridiculous anti-climax; nothing is resolved, but hey, I guess you could consider it a happy ending.<br/><br/>What makes the film watchable more than anything else are the performances. Robin Williams gives one of his first serious performances, and he is remarkable as Keating. We can clearly see how the character is inspiring and why the students take to him so quickly; he is a man who believes what he says, loves life, and overall stands in sharp contrast to those around him. Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Josh Charles all turn in fine performances as the most notable of the students, and Kurtwood Smith is excellent as Neil's domineering father. Even when the character relationships don't quite work, the performances are able to make them credible.<br/><br/>""Dead Poet's Society"" is a film that contains some memorable scenes, an excellent cast, and an excellent moral to inspire teenagers struggling to find their place in the world. It's easy to see, due to these elements, why it is considered to be a classic by so many people. However, the film has many negative aspects that cannot be ignored, and I can't say that ""Dead Poet's Society"" is one of my favorites.<br/><br/>6/10"
"dwr246","9","7","12","18 February 2005"," Carpe diem...
","A film that continually defies expectation, whether it is through the plot, characterizations, or performances of the actors. While you may not end up where you expected to, you are ultimately glad you went along for the ride.<br/><br/>It's 1959, and at Weldon Academy, tradition is everything. Weldon, however, is about to be shaken up by the arrival of John Keating (Robin Williams in an unusual dramatic turn), who encourages his students to look at things with new eyes. Among those who take his message most to heart are Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), son of an overbearing and unpleasant father (the truly evil Kurtwood Smith), and his roommate, Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), ignored younger brother of a previous Weldon valedictorian. While the students who form the ""Dead Poets Society"" have good intentions, participation in the group leads to Neil's defiance of his father, which in turn leads to tragedy. Todd has mostly been an observer throughout this, but the loss of one of the few people who cared about him, and the potential loss of another finally bring him out of his shell, and allow him to take his first stand.<br/><br/>This is an interesting script, in that it leads you to believe you're going to have a happy ending, and then snatches that ending away so quickly you hardly know what has happened. Before you can catch your breath, a suicide has occurred, the surviving parents are hounding the school, teachers and students are turning against each other, and the truth is buried under expediency, leaving the viewer wondering what was being taught in prep schools in the 1950's. In the end, Keating is used as a scapegoat to appease the anguished father, but the film leaves one more lesson to be taught before Keating leaves Weldon forever. Unfortunately, several plot points introduced prior to the suicide are simply dropped after it, leaving the viewer wondering what happened to the budding romance of one of the students and a town girl, as well as a few other things that just get left rather than addressed.<br/><br/>The setting of the prep school works rather well in this film, making it almost a world unto itself. The stone buildings represent the unchanging tradition valued so highly at Weldon. Nothing moves the stone; nothing changes the school. This further emphasizes the gulf between the students and the rest of the world on the occasions in which they enter it.<br/><br/>In spite of the flaws in the script, the performances are uniformly strong. Smith is the epitome of evil, oozing malice out of every pore in every scene he is in. Unfortunately, this works against him when he loses his son, in that we feel no sympathy for him at all. Williams gives a surprisingly restrained performance as Keating. What comedy there is in this film does not come from him. He plays Keating as a man of passion and integrity, who accepts his fate with grace and class. While Leonard can be a bit cloying, he does an excellent job of portraying Neil, especially the vulnerability which is behind the bravado. The most remarkable performance in the film Hawke's Todd. Not only do you see wonderful character development, but some of Hawke's most expressive acting occurs when he has no dialogue at all. It is through Todd's eyes that we see the end of the film - his upset that one of the Dead Poets Society has turned traitor and gotten another expelled, his disbelief that the others have joined in the persecution of Keating, and his inability to take a stand against that injustice. Most impressive is the scene where Todd watches Keating pack to leave the school, rather than pay attention to class. Todd has no dialogue throughout, yet Hawke's portrayal is so skillful that you see everything he is feeling, and the buildup to his outburst. A truly unforgettable scene.<br/><br/>This is a movie with an unhappy, yet satisfying ending. An injustice has been committed, but it has also been recognized, and perhaps a lesson learned. A thoughtful film, well worth watching repeatedly."
"jdberkley","1","49","125","15 June 2000"," One of the worst films ever made...
","I'm revisiting this comment long after I first wrote it, because I simply didn't explain why this film offends me to the degree that it does. First of all, I cannot recall another film made by artists I admire so much(Peter Weir, Robin Williams) that I detest this much. The moment this film tries to find a plot-- when Kurtwood Smith's character(Neil's father) argues with his son and asks, ""Why are you defying me, Neil? Is it this new man? This Mr. Keating?""-- it sounds completely fake. Why would the father assume his teenage son is challenging him because of a teacher? How would he know which teacher to blame? This movie careens through manipulative scenes without ever stopping to really learn about its characters-- Knox's romance with a local girl is given so little screen time, it's absolutely pointless. John Keating's scenes in the classroom use literature as a source for empty sloganeering. That's a concert, not a classroom.<br/><br/>But where the movie really fails its own ideals is in its treatment of the students as they begin to challenge the conventions of their supposedly oppressive private school. A movie that cared about them, and wanted to indict an authoritarian environment, would have a scene showing the school administrators leaning on a student, urging him to turn Keating over to save himself. Cameron, the turncoat character in this film, could have been written sympathetically-- he's an anxious wannabe with no friends, so, in a movie with some empathy, he'd be shown making the decision to rat out the group as a means to win his classmates over. Instead, he gets saddled with dialogue that makes him sound like a neo-Nazi, so that the audience can clap when Charlie punches him.<br/><br/>At the end of this film, after all the exhortations from their teacher to challenge convention and conformity, these students face a choice. They all choose to lie to save themselves. Wouldn't a good film show its characters making difficult choices and daring to live with the consequences? Wouldn't a film that really cared about education show us characters that have actually learned something?"

","I think hailing this movie as a classic is a bit too much, but bashing it as a dud is also too extreme.<br/><br/>The movie hoped to be one of those absolutely outstanding, feel-good flicks that changes peoples' lives. It isn't that, and sometimes the stretching it does to try to be so great makes the audience squeam.<br/><br/>It has some good points, good lines, and in my humble opinion, excellent actors portraying the boys in the Society. I am not a big fan of William's casting as Keating though.<br/><br/>The script is a little cliche and the fact that a bunch of fairly popular boys would want to gather and read poetry together is also a bit extreme. I guess what I'm saying is their portrayal of the boys themselves is overall unrealistic (When Neil grabs a cape and runs up and down, excited he's going to be in Midsummer Night's Dream? Teenage boys would not typically do that).<br/><br/>However with all that said, the message of the movie is fabulous. The teaching style of Keating is impressive and, contrary to what most people would think, there are teachers out there who approach teaching in a very unorthodox way and reach their students like no other can. I am a high school student and have seen some of these teachers.<br/><br/>I liked the ending, however bombastic some may call it. Definately watch it, maybe even buy it, but don't expect *too* much."

","This is a unique film, in that it is a Robin Williams movie where Robin Williams is not the biggest problem with it. The problem is the script, which treats poetry the way a Hallmark employee would treat it: a resource to exploit for some cheap sentimentality. ""Carpe diem, kids! That's what every poem is about. Every poem ever. Hell, now that you know that, why even read a whole poem? Let's just yell out some lines that I've chosen for you while we play sports. If anyone contradicts me, we'll just rip his page out of the textbook."" Ha, the best is when Keating is commenting on the poem of one of his students, and says something like: ""You've hit on one of the major themes of poetry: love!"" Really, teach? LOVE is one of the major themes of POETRY? Where do you get those amazing facts? Way to earn that paycheck.<br/><br/>Then, of course, the plot has only one function, which is to lead us to the moment of truth, when Keating is unfairly forced out and the kids scuff up the furniture for him. This must mean that the plot doesn't really stand up on its own. Every adult but Keating is a tyrant, including all the other teachers. But if they all hate progressive education so much, why the hell did they hire this guy? And it's been said before, but the suicide is ridiculously out of character and is meaningful only as a plot device. Wouldn't someone like Neil raid his dad's safe and hitchhike to New York or something instead of taking his own life? Oh, but that wouldn't give the school a reason to fire Keating. It's like the screenwriter imagined the final scene and then wrote the movie backwards.<br/><br/>This movie is about as deep as a movie of the week. Don't be fooled by the hype."

","Film set in 1959 (based on screenwriter Schulman's own experiences at academy) about liberal English teacher Williams influencing his students who attend all-boys Welton Academy. Focuses more on the group of boys, but Williams is able to work his off-the-cuff dialogue enough to keep you reminded that it's still him. Absolutely beautiful Northeastern setting, with excellent enough pacing to keep you entertained the entire way through. The boys are surprisingly less dorky than you'd think. The film never takes the easy way out, with Weir and Schulman seeming perfectly content with impending gloom. Kudos also for developing how important teachers can be to their students and vice versa. Williams' character was inspired by Samuel Pickering.<br/><br/>★★★½ (out of four)"
"willcundallreview","9","3","4","7 August 2015"," An incredible story of poetic freedom
","I watched this movie near one year after the tragic death of Robin Williams, and only for the first time. I had heard about the ""O Captain! My Captain!"" thing and knew it was a very popular film, but what I wasn't prepared for was how deeply emotional it is, and how much it resonates with the passing of Williams. This is a movie that although could be described as trying too hard for emotion, still just makes you want to smile, you want these boys to break out of their closed off traditional world and do what they want to do in life.<br/><br/>The story is about an elite prep boarding school and its students, where some are being worked hard as they await the day they enter college. But in comes Mr Keating, a new English teacher who's ways don't exactly impress the hard up parents and teachers, who's values are very much the underpinning of what the young students despise. The story has its ways of making Williams just great to watch; the young guys who act here work well alongside him and make this a movie that has no central character, but a central story to share.<br/><br/>Directed by Peter Weir, the movie is not all about Robin Williams and the famous scenes that are involved. In fact Weir gives just a fine performance as any other, his directing is finely done and he knows how to control the emotion of the film so that it isn't always one tone. Tom Schulman whose experiences inspired this movie, creates a beautiful script, in fact I am not quite sure if is Weir or Schulman who make this special, but in any case both are on great form. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast pitch in well too, a young Ethan Hawke as the painfully shy Todd is OK, I am not sure if he is good but in any case his more emotional side is fascinating when done. Josh Charles as Knox is also good and the other boys involved such as Robert Sean Leonard are good also. I found if any part of the movie stops this from utter perfection, then the acting is what it is, by no means bad but sometimes a little over the top. As for Williams's nomination for an Academy Award, well maybe I agree, I mean his acting is great here and although I've seen some criticise his comic side coming out here, I for one don't think it was a bad thing.<br/><br/>When you get a film that just makes you think, you know it is fairly special, but one that adds into it emotion too, then it starts to become sublime. This film knows how to challenge perception, and even though this is set in 1959 and made in 1989, the ideas that Keating uses are still inspirational today, and the way in which he talks about poetry can at times be most beautiful. I think again a lot of praise goes to Schulman for creating a script that can mean a lot to someone, watch this at just the right age and this could blow your mind, it really could.<br/><br/>Is it for everyone? well it should be, a movie I would highly recommend to someone even if they don't usually like this kind of movie, simply because of the thought process involved. It isn't even too long, I felt maybe for it to one of the best ever, it had to maybe have had an even better ending than it already does, which is a really fine ending by the way. It should keep you gripped throughout, it never made me feel bored or like I had better things to do, it was a rare movie that spoke to me and opened my mind as I feel the people behind this wanted it to do."

","Dead Poets Society is a film about a group of boys attending a prestigious Prep school in New England during the 1950's. The story follows Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), the younger brother of a former valedictorian, and his roommate, Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a exceptionally bright, artistic student with a overbearing father. <br/><br/>The school rests upon four pillars: tradition, honor, discipline, and excellence. However, a new outlook comes in the form of a new teacher. The new English teacher, a former student John Keating (Robin Williams), presents the students with a different outlook and encourages the boys to seize the day. His unorthodox teaching methods stir up his students imagination and anger some of the more traditional characters in the film. <br/><br/>There are many themes throughout, but above all else the message is to follow your heart. The story is extremely well written and the cast of young actors do well to bring the out the uncertainties and excitement of adolescence. The set design and direction capture this period and produce a story that will pass the test of time. <br/><br/>Robin Williams performance in this film ranks among his best. He has departed us, but his legacy lives on. He visits us through his films and tells us ""Carpe Diem""!"

","English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) inspires his students to discover their love for poetry and seize the day.<br/><br/>This is a story about what one teacher (or a mentor of any kind) can do to inspire the youth, whether it be for good or evil. Those viewing this film will generally see it as a force for good, a call to ""seize the day"". And that is probably the correct interpretation.<br/><br/>But interestingly, the call for non-conformity leads to its own kind of conformity. And one could argue that Keating's power is not much different than that of a politician or cult leader. Had he chosen to use it differently, he could have been a very dangerous force in these young men's lives. In fact, we see not everyone who followed his path was better because of it."

","After recently watching ""Mrs Doubtfire"" And then ""Old Dogs"" a movie from the latter part of the late Robin Williams's career. I decided to revisit some of his earlier dramatic work. And one phrase came tonight ""Oh Captain, my Captain"". so I immediately settled on 1988's ""Dead Poets Society"".<br/><br/>I also forgot about this brilliant quote. ""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary"" I don't know if it was the tagline for the movie, but it certainly should have been.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) has been sent to the school where his popular older brother was valedictorian.

Kurtwood Smith is his usual reliable self as Mr Perry, the dominating father, and all of the ""boys"" do well in their roles. Ethan Hawke is especially good, likewise Josh Charles, Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Henson.<br/><br/>Some may find it boring, and it is slow in parts, but Williams's performance more than papers over the few cracks.

","This is the type of movie that really makes a person think about how they're currently living. Not think in the way, such as after watching inception where you think a lot, but mostly just about the ending of the movie. Dead Poets Society made me think the way I do after reading a great novel or poem, in ways I didn't think I could. It makes you think about the way you are being treated by the people around you, and about how you are currently treating the people around you. It has an especially heart-wrenching ending since the death of Robin Williams. Everyday should be seized as if it is the last to be lived, and no one should live thinking otherwise. The implications of feeling stuck or lost or alone are all portrayed, in some of the most radical ways, in this movie. The superb acting and directing adds to the great story line and writing. This movie is a must see."
"CinematicInceptions","8","3","4","11 December 2014"," Inspiring in multiple ways and very character driven.
","Although this is set in the fifties, I think it's delivery of the ideals of nonconformity are timeless. As a current high schooler, I can attest to the fact that conformity is extant among teenagers. There are very few Neil Perry's today, and the few that remain are mostly seen as rather queer. This is a sad truth, but the fact remains that for some inconceivable reason people are more inclined to follow popular whims than their own interests. This movie introduces the idea what is socially cool and accepted isn't necessarily enjoyable. The poetry that Keating shows his students isn't stuff that's going to make you the popular guy in school for knowing, but it's inspiring and awesome.<br/><br/>This is seen in the progression of the students' attitudes toward the Dead Poet's ideas. At first they react to Keating's lessons with confusion and almost fear, especially in the case of Todd Anderson. When Keating tells them of the cult that he started when he was in their position in a way that appeals to them, they begin to realize that it might be worth the effort to go deeper into some of this poetry. After a couple of meetings, they have fully embraced it and realize the wonders and opportunities that it provides. They now start to question authority, especially in the cases of Dalton and Neil. Keating's lesson of walking in your own way is especially helpful in this regard. The really interesting thing about Keating's teaching is that he does not actually have that much screen time, but he does have a profound impact on his pupils. He really leaves them to make their own conclusions as to what his lessons mean with only a few featured lessons. In other words, he does an ""inception"" with them.<br/><br/>We can see that each of them acts upon his lessons differently and ""seize the day"" after their own fashion. Dalton, Neil, Knox, and even Todd to and extent use his lessons as inspiration for courageous acts, again in different ways. Pitts, Meeks, and Cameron are also inspired by the lessons and the secret meetings, though they do not have a storyline to prove it so concretely. <br/><br/>While all of the main roles get a pretty good amount of development, the most prominent plot is that of Neil Perry's dispute with his father. This is the one point where Keating gives explicit and specific advice to any of his students. The villainy of Mr. Perry is not at all implausible since the world is full of over-assertive parents, though his motive is understandable. Neil's (SPOILER ALERT) suicide at the end at first struck me as surprising and uncalled for, but when I took a step back, it made sense. I think this was because I didn't fully understand what he was being forced to leave when his father took him out of school. It seemed like he was only upset about the loss of being able to act, but it's also the loss of all of his friends and Mr. Keating. So Mr. Perry is essentially destroying Neil's world. <br/><br/>The events that result after Neil's tragedy are primarily driven by the other villain, Mr. Nolan. He is very pro-conformism and by the books, which we have learned to despise by the end of the movie. He has some great villainous moments at the end with the dismissal and canning of Keating, though I felt like that process got unnecessarily drawn out. The final minute of the film with the rebellion of the class is a great ending that adds a positive and inspiring touch to the darkness and gloom of recent events. <br/><br/>To wrap up, I would recommend this movie to people who like inspiration of a non-forceful nature. It's a very character and story driven movie with no action or comedy. In other words, it's interesting over entertaining. As with Keating's students, each viewer will take something different out of the movie. It's good to watch with people that will be genuinely interested in watching it. Overall Rating: 8.4"

","I absolutely love this film! Everything from the beautiful cinematography, to the pacing and the directing is purely magical and awe inspiring! There are many powerful moments in this film. Dead Poets Society motivates me intensely, with its message that you have to have the courage to follow your dreams, to live your life the way you want. Be willing to stand up to authority, if that authority stifles your dreams.<br/><br/>Robin Williams is brilliant here, but so is Robert Sean Leonard! In fact, all of the young actors are outstanding! Especially for Robert Sean Leonard and Robin Williams, viewers are drawn into this film as if you knew the characters they play and the emotions they feel. You envision John Keating, (played by Robin Williams) as the inspirational teacher you once had, or wish had. You automatically empathize with Neil Perry (Played by Robert Sean Leonard) dreams of becoming an actor, against the wishes of his ultra-authoritarian father.<br/><br/>I indirectly know someone who had an ultra-strict father like Neil, and sought a free-spirited life away from his demanding father and his family's rigorous lifestyle and demands of academic success. This person devoted his life to reading, philosophy, the hippie movement, writing, and humanitarian efforts. He was troubled by inequities and hypocrisy in society. He loved to help people, everything he did was for humanity. Both Neil and Mr. Keating would move him to tears! They would understand this person I knew, and I think of him every time I see this movie. It moves me, deeply.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society encourages others to become free, independent, thinkers. To believe in yourself, and to show how writing and the power of poetry can inspire you and others around you. The sensitivity that this film shows is stunning! This movie will make you think and melt your heart! It is very emotional! ""Carpe Diem! Seize the Day! Make your lives extraordinary!"" See this landmark film!"

","One of the finest films. It is inspiring and needs to be seen just for sheer writing. <br/><br/>Well written and wonderfully acted, this film does that something, which many films on teenagers fail to do. It inspires us to go out and live a life. To LIVE is a great deed for a teenager who will be missing out on life, in the run for the rot. The rot includes fulfilling aspirations of parents which are way different from his own, it include running for the marks and grades, it includes missing out on fun which we are supposed to have as teenagers, it essentially includes that we do not identify our dream and shall be living others dreams. Teenagers or adolescents do not know what they want to be in many cases, they figure that out as they grow. This can be because of influence by friends or by the college teachers or even an idea he just got or maybe a talent which he would have recognized just then. But before realizing that, they are pushed in many cases by parents into a corner and the parents squeeze what they want them to be. It is a failure and many teenagers succumb to this pressure and even give up life. The more than half, ordinary guys follow the aspirations of their parents which they believe is good for them. Because of the more or less universal thought that ""Parents think for the good of their kids"". Though in many cases it is true, it is a big lie in few cases.<br/><br/>I take my life as an example, I wanted to do arts, but I was pushed into engineering. Now, I am not a good artist nor a considerable engineer. I am bad at both and I attribute the failure of this, to the choice done by my elders, who have not tried to figure out my aspirations and simply let me be what I want to be. Such, is the life of Neil Perry (played by Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor, while his father does not want him to be that.<br/><br/>Acted wonderfully by Robin Williams, who plays the part of John Keating this film speaks volumes of how good an actor Robin is. His eyes and his mere sigh do tell a lot, which so many histrionics could not have said. This is a very controlled performance by Robin, and in this film and ""Good Will Hunting"" I rate his acting as his best ever till date.<br/><br/>But the best part is not Robin Williams here, it is Peter Weir the director, who makes the scenes so personal and they can be related to many teenagers. We had fantasies in our teens, we wanted to be something big and something different, we wanted to acquire talents that will take us forward in our lives. So it is very easy to relate to any teenager or an adult who seems to have missed his teens.<br/><br/>The another best or great part if Tom Schulman, who wrote the screenplay, giving us the wonderful lines and scenes that shall be etched in our memory long after we have watched it. this is one of the few films, I fall back on when I look for some inspiration, it essentially helps us write.<br/><br/>Like in one scene, Robin Williams gives his students an Onion and asks them to see if they can write a poem on that. Damn, good it is.<br/><br/>I am going with 5/5, this is wonderful and I like it, in fact Love it. My favorite dialog is the most famous line of Robin ""Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary"""
"yris2002","10","3","4","2 January 2010"," No more words: just see and love it
","I saw ""The dead poets society"" on TV for the umpteenth time, after at least ten years. And I felt like writing something about this awesome picture and I am happy to write the first review of the year with a movie full of faith, inspiration and courage. It is certainly one of my ten favourite pictures, each time capable of arousing such a strong emotional impact, that words seem to be insufficient, as too limited and limiting. In this sense, I think it is very difficult to say something new, or vaguely original about such a masterpiece that can speak and appeal naturally to the public without needing any praising words. However, after seeing it I couldn't but compare the impact it exerted on me the first time I saw it, being in my teens, and now, being a young woman. The first time represented a revelation, Joyce would call it an epiphany, I was totally absorbed and completely overwhelmed and, although not being able to get subtle and more mature hints, it was from the moment I saw it that I could clearly distinguish between teachers who meant teaching as a vocation, and those who just taught to make a living. I never had the fortune of enjoying a teacher of such a sort, but could feel those who really felt the responsibility of educating, and growing children and not only passing information to them. This time I still felt deeply emotionally involved, and still in the last scene I wanted to enter and stand on that desk, and join the students shouting ""Oh Captain, My captain"". Let's admit, that even though the student's years are far away, I still look forward to meeting a man like him, as endowed with a sensitivity and a human depth that would make him an ideal friend, or a perfect soul-mate. In the end, I can only say: see it and feel it, I have no children, nor students, but if I had I would let them see it, and I would consider it as a precious gift."
"JamesHitchcock","10","3","4","6 February 2009"," Make your life extraordinary!
","To celebrate my 600th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. ""Dead Poets Society"" is an ""inspirational teacher"" film set at Welton Academy, Vermont, a boarding school organised on the lines of an English public school and based around ""Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence"". John Keating, a newly appointed English teacher, has a deep love of literature, especially poetry, and aims to inspire a similar love in his pupils. (His name was presumably chosen in homage to the poet John Keats). His aims as a teacher, however, go further; he also introduces the boys to his philosophy of life, summed up by the Latin phrase carpe diem (seize the day). Be true to yourself, think for yourself and make your life extraordinary. Rather than ""Sir"", he likes his class to call him ""Captain, my Captain"", as in Walt Whitman's poem. In one memorable scene he encourages his class to rip out of their textbooks a ridiculous essay which claims that the ""greatness"" of a poem can be calculated according to the mathematical formula PxI=G.<br/><br/>Like another great eighties film, Barry Levinson's ""Diner"", ""Dead Poets Society"" is set at the end of 1959. In both films this choice of date has a symbolic significance. The fifties- often seen as a conservative decade- are about to give way to the sixties, the decade of rebellion. The times they are a-changing. Inspired by Keating, a number of boys revive the Dead Poets Society, a secret literary society of which Keating was a member when he was himself a pupil at the school, and try to live up to his ideals. This does not go down well with the school authorities, especially the stern, traditionalist headmaster Mr Nolan, who accuses Keating of encouraging rebellion with his unconventional teaching methods.<br/><br/>When I recently watched this film again I was struck by two things which I had perhaps forgotten since I last saw it. The first is how physically beautiful it is. It was filmed in and around an actual academy (in Maryland rather than Vermont) and Peter Weir achieves some striking images of the school's grey Victorian buildings against the colours of the autumn leaves and the winter snows. Particularly memorable was the scene of the lone piper playing by the lake.<br/><br/>The second thing that struck me was how well the various boys are characterised as individuals in their own right. Charlie Dalton is headstrong and rebellious, Stephen Meeks geeky and academic, Knox Overstreet easy-going. (There is a comic sub-plot about his romance with a local girl, Chris, and his problems with her obnoxious boyfriend Chet). Richard Cameron is a natural conformist who betrays Keating to the authorities when the going gets tough. The two most important characters among the boys are Todd Anderson and Neil Perry. Todd is a shy, nervous boy who gradually develops greater self-confidence under Keating's influence. Neil is sensitive and intelligent, with ambitions to become an actor. These ambitions, however, bring him into conflict with his autocratic father, who is determined that his son shall become a doctor (he has even decided which medical school Neil will attend) and lead to the film's tragic denouement.<br/><br/>The film has a lot in common with an earlier ""inspirational teacher"" film, ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"". Like Jean Brodie, Keating is a teacher at a highly conservative and conformist private school. Like her, he is by nature a nonconformist and rebel against authority. And like her he encourages his pupils to think for themselves and thereby incurs the displeasure of the school authorities. There is, however, an important difference; Keating is a much more sympathetic character than Jean Brodie, who paradoxically combines her progressive educational philosophy with an open admiration for fascism. Whereas he is capable of inspiring his boys with a genuine love of his subject, she seems most concerned to inspire her girls with a love of herself.<br/><br/>I have often felt that Weir's work has been influenced by that of Stanley Kubrick, and the final scene may be a reference to one of Kubrick's most famous. Keating has been sacked by Nolan and the school governors, and comes to say farewell to his class of students. In a gesture of loyalty to their defeated leader, and led by the once-timid Todd, they climb on their desks and exclaim ""O Captain! My Captain!"" Whether Weir intended it or not, I was strongly reminded of ""I'm Spartacus!"" <br/><br/>Robin Williams here gives the best performance of many good ones in his career; he was nominated for ""Best Actor"", but did not win. At least he had the comfort of knowing he lost to another extraordinary performance, Daniel Day Lewis's in ""My Left Foot"". Tom Schulman won a deserved ""Best Screenplay"" Oscar for his script. 1989 was a strong year in the cinema, with a number of excellent films, but I felt that ""Dead Poets Society"", not ""Driving Miss Daisy"", should have taken the ""Best Picture"" award.<br/><br/>Let me close with my personal reason for loving this film, quite apart from its fine acting, great direction and an intelligent and literate script. When I first saw it in the autumn of 1989 I was going through a very difficult period in my life, but I could draw courage from its message of hope and inspiration. It is very rare for a film to affect me so directly, but this one did. My heartfelt thanks to Messrs Weir, Williams and Schulman. You have made your film extraordinary. 10/10"

Professor Keating gets down to basic facts about poetry and turns this subject into a very enjoyable experience which relates to how you can live in this world and have a great experience in doing whatever you really want to do and it also draws out young men's mental feelings about themselves and other people. This story also dwells with a young man named Todd Anderson, (Ethan Hawke) who is a very shy student and also had an older brother who attended this same college and was valedictorian, which are hard shoes to step into. Todd's room-mate is Neil Perry, ( Robert Sean Leonard) who has a very overbearing father and wants him to go to medical school and does not want him to waste his time on any social activities at the college. This story becomes very interesting with some of the students falling madly in love with pretty gals which makes this film a great all around treat to watch and enjoy."

","I'm a huge fan of movies and have been ever since I can remember. I grew up loving movies like Rodgers and Hammerstein and musicals. But DPS is the movie that I was ever grounded from when I was younger. I used to watch it like two times a day. Though I thought that Robin Williams should have won the Oscar and it should have won the best picture. The Oscars are not up to me. But if they were Robin would have won and it so would have best picture. You see true friendship in the group. Especially between Neil and Tood. Tood who I could relate to more, was the shy one in the group. But with the help of Neil, the rest of the group and Mr. Keating, Todd learns to step out of his comfort zone and at the end of the movie does the right thing. It was wonderfully acted and cast. And a beautiful film. It is one of the best movies of all times. Yeah it's a tear jerker and touches your heart with it's true, raw emotion that shows through in every scene. Yeah some may think that it's a bit of a chick flick. But there I disagree. I believe to be a movie that everyone can enjoy and love."

","Australian director Peter Weir's third picture in Hollywood, 'Dead Poets Society (1989),' doesn't really explore any territory that has not been covered before. For most of the film, we can pretty much predict exactly where Tom Schulman's screenplay is heading, and so there are few surprises to set it apart from other movies of its kind. However, despite his film's hint of unoriginality, Weir hardly puts a foot wrong, and 'Dead Poets Society' proves a thoughtful, funny, haunting and inspirational drama that'll certainly stay with you once you've seen it. Accompanying a cast of bright, young actors {some of whom you'll recognise from their later successes, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard} is comedy veteran Robin Williams, whose warmth and passion forms the emotional core of the story.<br/><br/>The prestigious Welton Academy prep school (""Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence""), as they're four-pillar motto suggests, has a long-standing history of success and high reputation. The young male students of the college are expected, at all times, to respect rules and authority, and to continually strive for greater and greater academic achievements. Into the school comes former student, now English teacher, John Keating (Williams), whose unorthodox approach to lessons, and vigorous passion towards literature and poetry, inspires many of his impressionable young students, and severely ruffles the feathers of Welton Academy's management. Keating's rousing motto of ""carpe diem"" (a Latin phrase meaning ""pluck/seize the day,"" borrowed from Horace's ""Odes 1.11"") inspires the young boys to make the most of every opportunity, and to look within themselves to discover the correct path for their lives.<br/><br/>The film proved quite successful at the 1990 Academy Awards, acquiring an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and nominations for Best Actor (Robin Williams), Best Director (Weir's second nomination in that category) and Best Picture. Perhaps because of the preparatory school setting and the cast of young actors, 'Dead Poets Society' seems as though it would be most effective with young teenage boys, who will relish the film's opposition towards conformity and strict authority. Nevertheless, the film also boasts a more important moral from which we can all take something: always seize the opportunities that are presented to you, and make every day of your life count."

","I'm 15 and probably would never have looked at this in the video shop and bought it. After i was introduced to it in English class and after watching it changed my mind about old non-action films. For the first 5 minutes i was bored to death but then as the film progressed i began to understand the characters and recognize some actors. Half way though the film i thought ""Wow, I'm gonna hire this out"". The film had everything from comedy, drama, romance, suspense and enjoyment and i thought ""whats not to like"". A top notch performance by a young Ethan hawke who played a nervous Todd Anderson. Its a shame you don't get movies like this anymore but this one is an instant classic."

","""Oh captain, my captain..."" <br/><br/>I watched ""Dead Poets Society"" twice and I could watch it thousands of times without being bored ! It's absolutely perfect ! This movie is also very topical even if it takes place in the fifties. The fight against conformism is and will always be fundamental.<br/><br/>Some might say that this movie is demagogue but in my opinion it's an example for young people of yesterday, today and tomorrow. <br/><br/>As far as the cast is concerned, Robin Williams is great, as always, and the young men (among them the future star Ethan Hawke) act very well.<br/><br/>So watch this excellent movie and...

","It's my all time favorite! When I first saw this movie, it was in my 9th grade English class (and it was an assignment). I didn't like it the first time, but as I watched it the second time, I fell in love with it. Now it's on DVD, and I can enjoy it even more. Robin Williams plays a dramatic English teacher guiding his students to explore new insights. Robert Leonard plays the passionate son of an unreasonable demanding father. Ethan Hawke plays his new best friend who dares not to speak in front of anybody for his fear of people not listening to his ideas. Norman Lyodd plays the heartless headmaster who believes the role of tradition is more important than the hopes and dreams of the students at Welton. When I went to the website that had scripts of deleted scenes, some I wished had stayed in the film. I loved this movie because I could imagine myself being a part of the film. Thumbs up to the actors and the directors."

","About three months ago, this came on TV where I live at about 11.30 on a Saturday night (why it had to be on that late I have no idea). I taped it and watched it the next day and it's the only movie I've recently seen for the first time that really kicked me in the pants. About five days later I immediately bought the DVD. I was that blown away.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT! <br/><br/>It's 1959. Rebellious English professor John Keating (a wonderfully restrained, Oscar-nominated performance from Robin Williams, free of his usual quirks which are enjoyable but would be unnecessary here) arrives at Welton Academy, a posh all-boys school with an ages-old curriculum set in stone. Mr. Keating ignores the school's approved teaching methods, much to the dismay of Headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd), and instills in his students a love of poetry, inspiring them to ignore authority and make their lives extraordinary. This backfires when aspiring actor Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) commits suicide after his father (a role tailor-made for Kurtwood Smith, better known now for his identical but comic role as Red Forman in TV's ""That '70s Show"") forces him to become a doctor. Mr. Keating is blamed for this tragedy, and his remaining students stand up for him when he is threatened to be fired.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is a film about rebelling against authority. Mr. Keating is one of the great cinematic school teachers, and if he were real I'd give anything to be in his class. Williams is brilliant, but the real acting honours go to the actors playing the students, especially Leonard (who ironically now plays a doctor in TV's ""House"") and most notably a young Ethan Hawke, who delivers a tour de force performance as Todd Anderson, the student who is hit the hardest by Neil's death. Tom Schulman's glowing Oscar-winning screenplay is filled with less-than-perfect characters, a dash of much-needed humour, it avoids sentimentality and considering I often *hate* poetry, it makes the stuff seem interesting.<br/><br/>However, it is Australian director Peter Weir's (who makes me, a budding filmmaker myself, proud to be an Australian) masterful handling of two key scenes late in the film which catapults it way beyond average status. The first is Neil Perry's suicide scene. Neil and his father have an argument one night after his father discovers Neil acting in a stage play. His father holds the power in the conversation and orders Neil to follow a career in medicine. Later on when his parents are asleep, Neil walks into his father's study, opens a drawer in the desk, takes out his father's revolver pistol and pulls the trigger. Weir wisely splashes this scene with dull and depressing colours (blacks and whites) to suit the mood described in Schulman's script, but instead of actually showing Neil pulling the trigger, Weir cuts away to Mr. Perry laying in his bed being awoken by the chilling sound of a gunshot downstairs. This makes my hair stand on end every time I watch the film.<br/><br/>The second is the exceptional climax. Now that Mr. Keating has been held responsible for Neil's death, he has been fired and interrupts his former class (now taught by Mr. Nolan) to get his things before he leaves. Todd Anderson causes an outburst and sticks up for Mr. Keating by standing on his desk and shouting ""O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN!"" like Mr. Keating instructed his students. Soon half the class joins in, with Mr. Nolan shouting at them to all sit down. The class giving Mr. Keating a standing ovation shows how much one person can impact others' lives, either positively or negatively. In this case, Mr. Keating has given his students direction and a reason to live. It surely stands alongside One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back as one of the most unforgettable movie climaxes ever. Damn you, Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS!<br/><br/>If there are any teenagers like me out there who are reading this review and haven't yet seen this remarkable film, I urge you to do so. It could just change your life.<br/><br/>10/10.<br/><br/>Catch ya!"
"laurita_a","10","3","4","26 October 2000"," Robin Williams should have won an Oscar
","I fell in love with this film at first viewing.  It broke my heart and quickly entered in to my own private top five movies.  Robin Williams is one of the most versatile actors in the industry.  He plays drama and comedy with the same intensity and that is so rare.  Understandably though, he was nominated against a tough crowd that year (Morgan Freeman-Driving Miss Daisy, Daniel Day-Lewis-My Left Foot (winner), Kenneth Branagh-Henry V, and Tom Cruise-Born on the Fourth of July)."
"goodnightandgoodluckyou","10","4","6","12 April 2010"," I wish I had seen this movie sooner.
","I could agree with Roger Ebert had I not watched the movie from a completely different view point. For me, the movie works as an insight into a few boys life at Welton in 1959. First of all that year excites me, they were on the cusp of revolution and perhaps a few could predict what would happen a year later but the mini revolution that was started at the school, the daring concept of character over tradition, was something that would change those boys lives. In good ways, in bad ways but ultimately it would be a test of their characters in BIG ways.<br/><br/>The story starts off with a new teacher. Robin Williams plays the passionate John Keating. He wants to teach the boys poetry ..not lines, but poetry in their souls. It is that spirit of such poetry and the spirit of carpe diem (seize the day) that is lit like a candle in some boys and a fire in others; Neil, Todd, Charlie, Knox, Meeks and Pitts as well as a few other of their classmates.<br/><br/>Neil (Robert Sean Leonard pre, pre House) is a star pupil who wants to act, Todd (Ethan Hawke) is the new shy boy, Charlie (Gale Hansen) makes the boys laugh and us audience laugh and swoon, Knox (Josh Charles) is the one who dares to woo a girl he meets at a formal dinner, Meeks is the sweet boy and he and Pitts are scientifically both challenged and inspired.<br/><br/>Mr Keating tells them to rip out anything that restricts their thinking. Poetry should be FELT. After all, we each have poetry in us and we each apply it in different ways. Not everyone actually reads and writes poetry, some spend hours trying to find a solution to a problem. That is what the movie is about to me, the spirit of that poetry and I feel it could have alienated people had it been more about the poetry, instead it doesn't pay ""lip service"" to poets and poems, but it gets right down to their core; which is their spirit.<br/><br/>And I would have done what they did in their cave meetings too, which is basically have fun.<br/><br/>My only minor ""problem"" with the movie lies in what Keating says- despite not being a scientist myself, I believe science can also be a source of beauty, poetry and something to stay alive for also. But I'm taking Mr Keating too literally and I'm sure Meeks and Pitts who were the scientists would have remembered what Mr Keating said and applied passion to science.<br/><br/>The tragedy of the movie lies in the most passionate and proactive personality in the movie, the one whose Mr Keating's teachings light a fire inside. It is even more tragic given the year..perhaps ten years later, what happens would not have happened, one has to wonder.<br/><br/>There have been those who find that storyline unrealistic and yet it is realistic, in that it happens. It's also a cautionary tales to parents who want to live through their children, I can even see similarities in this movie and Mahabharat which is a big epic in India based on fact.<br/><br/>For me it took time to understand the character involved the storyline, because the movie is not a sit down let's talk type, it doesn't give you the answers, it doesn't underestimate the audience, it's an old school movie. I will say no more other than I think this character wanted to seize the passion.<br/><br/>And like life, things and people in Dead Poets Society are always moving, the movie relies on you as an audience to pay attention and you might, just might, catch something that you missed before or that the person next to you missed. Poetry isn't going to make your life neat and tidy nor is it going to change your life, that is up to you. Mr Keating didn't come along with an in depth character analysis and the movie is dynamic, it has kinetic energy, when you see Welton, you see see different angled shots in the corridors, in class rooms, outside you see nature, there's music, on paper it sounds like any other movie but on screen Dead Poets Society is alive. Mr Keating represents the movie..and we represent the students. He COULD change our lives..if we keep ourselves open to what he says. That's how I like to watch this movie.<br/><br/>And the final scene was not trite nor sweet to me, nor a kiss up, it was a final straw for a a living, breathing, sad, perhaps angry and inspired soul of a student AND a boy. A sweet ending wouldn't have any of that because it would tie things up and not leave them open. But like life Dead Poets Society isn't a carefully arranged neat little present. It's only neatness lies in how its made, a beautiful quality of a movie, I don't know the technical terms but I can say the cinematography and the direction are not slow, or too fast, when Keating is talking you see his words in each of the students faces, their reactions. Peter Weir the director has links between his movies, action and reaction and every person taking charge of their life, you watch Gallipoli, The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it's about human spirit. The final scene of Dead Poets Society is about human spirit, don't conform, take charge of your life and make a stand for what you believe in. The power of that scene can be applied to a grand action or a small one, but it's something I remember whenever I am forced to cower, with the rest of the world as Mr Nolans- the headmaster of Welton, trying to get me to their way or to be quiet. Except I watched the movie and I won't."

","I recently re-watched this film at my current ripe age of 30. I haven't watched this movie since the mid 90s when I watched it on TV. So that puts about 10-12 years since I've last seen it.<br/><br/>I rented this movie because I recalled that it made such an impression on me. After watching the film again, I can remember why. The protagonists are a group of impressionable teenagers who are about to enter college. This is the age at which I saw this film.<br/><br/>Robin Williams' character, Keating, is introduced as a teacher of poetry but becomes a teacher of life. His lessons of carpe diem (""seize the day""), living life to its fullest and nonconformity are the types of messages that ring true in the hearts and minds of teenagers. <br/><br/>At this age, I find the film pleasurable but when I watched it at the time, I felt truly inspired. It was the sort of film that really made me think and feel and the general ideas sat with me for some time."

It has great acting, inspiring theme, great, truly memorable quotes, memorable scenes and even a great soundtrack(especially in the ending scene). It's about truly teaching, truly learning, overcoming your fears, standing up for yourself, standing up for what you stand for, it's about ""sounding your barbaric roar over the rooftops of the world""! Lately i have been to a lot of movies that just seemed an end of my time. Reckless directing, bad acting, boring, lacking originality, filled with bombing images which don't say anything.

","... Speaking for myself, I don't want to spend a large amount of time in the company of young men who need *permission* to be themselves. If teacher John Keating's role necessitated 'guidance', THEN I could understand, but it doesn't. They all show themselves to have a certain amount of gumption and intelligence outside of the classroom; so why once they get in there are they portrayed as spineless saps who need to be taken by the hand and 'shown the way'?!<br/><br/>Keating (Williams) didn't seem to me to have as much effect as I was led to expect and hoped for as I watched. This was more about the boys just being lucky enough to have a role-model standing in front of them who didn't fit societal norms at the time. The kids weren't taught anything much beyond learning how to follow their own instincts, and really, shouldn't fraternising with your peers teach you to do that adequately enough?!<br/><br/>It's hard to feel sympathy for people who've got all the raw materials already there; but appear to be so feckless that they need to be *pushed* in order to put them to use! Films that show mentoring the disadvantaged are easier to get behind because you're rooting for the underdogs; there's just no such incentive, in this case. This may be much better made than material like ""Dangerous Minds"", but at least in that case there's more 'antagonism' going on underneath the surface...<br/><br/>I still enjoyed the film greatly; but making the circumstances of the pupils more sympathetic straight from the get-go would have turned this film into one of my all-time favourites..."

The more I see it, the more I yearn to see it again.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society strikes me so hard and passionately that it is hard to differentciate myself from the story and the characters.  The cast of character in personality and over all style is me and my friends.  I am involved in the theatre arts and I feel as if I know Neil's passion for acting.  My friends all fit in line with characters from girl crazy to tall lanky and awkward.

"bob the moo","Null","9","18","11 July 2004"," Sappy but well acted  not my thing but I can see why some love it to death
","In an exclusive prep school in the 1950's, the focus is on grades and learning as sons follow their fathers' footsteps into the family profession.<br/><br/>However, for a group of friends this changes when a new English teacher starts. As Mr Keating teaches them to express themselves and free their souls, the boys form a club for the reading of poetry and the discovery of beauty. However against an uptight background, tensions are formed and the boys learn more than they had expected.<br/><br/>With my mother wishing to watch this film, I decided to stick around and give it a try as well, even though I had seen it before when it had come out. True to my memory the film is a quite sentimental coming of age story that does pretty much what you expect but feels quite classy. The story isn't overly moving but some scenes pull on the heart, albeit in a rather cynical 'swelling music' way. However, it does work even if I don't think the Oscar praise was totally deserving  if pushed I would say it was one of the better 'coming of age' things I'd seen recently.<br/><br/>The cast are all pretty good and have mostly become more famous with time. Williams is his usual sappy self but tones it down a little here. Considering that his role is really just a supporting one, a catalyst for the boys' story, Williams manages to make a big impression with key scenes. I'm not a big fan of his but he gives a well-delivered performance here. Leonard and Hawke are both pretty strong even if it is hard to see them as young boys now  I can't help but see them as they are now. Support is good from Smith, Charles, Hansen etc but really the film belongs to Hawke and Leonard unless Williams is swinging in to steal his individual scenes from them.<br/><br/>Very much a mothers' film this one  if you like the weepy, sentimental genre then you should love this. To be honest it is not really my cup of tea but I did quite enjoy it and felt the writing was pretty good  just a shame that it is never more than a crying boy away from slipping into bonding and sentimentality. A little syrupy and will put off those who dislike such things but fans of the genre will love it and will leave it buoyed up by the message of 'carpe diem'."
"bwilkening","4","15","34","7 June 2006"," This movie hasn't aged well
","Well, I remember loving this movie when I first saw it 15 years ago in junior high, but perhaps the film's main theme of a young, convention-defying teacher challenging kids to think freely and ""seize the day"" (an injunction that was repeated ad nauseum, even by a kid who used it as justification for molesting a passed-out girl) has been mimicked so many times that it just isn't novel anymore. More than that, however, the film has a number of inherent flaws.<br/><br/>Williams plays Keating, an English professor who has just arrived at a prep school run by an authoritarian type who is hell-bent on adhering to the institution's guiding principles of tradition and discipline. Williams literally appears to be the only teacher at the school under the age of 95. Williams throws around a lot of quotes, but the full context and meaning of the quotes or the poems from which they are plundered are never explored but are rather exploited to make a cheap point. Whitman's ""Oh Captain! My Captain!"" is invoked merely b/c Keating wants the students to call him that. At one point Keating gets in an argument with an older teacher who questions his teaching methods, and both engage in a competition of trading quotes from poems. Have any two people in the entire history of humankind ever argued like this? Just curious.<br/><br/>So what are these teaching methods that have the school's elders so worried? Well, most of Keating's classes seem to take place outside. He has the students do things like walk around in a courtyard (so they can ""choose their own direction"") or recite poems while kicking a ball. He also has them stand up on desks. Keating is apparently a rugby coach as well. At least, I am assuming this, because of the shot in which the kids are playing rugby and Keating is running along the sidelines like an idiot with his hands over his head. Keating doesn't care for textbooks, having students tear out the introduction to a textbook in which it is claimed that poems can be judged on two dimensions and then plotted on an axis. Did such textbooks actually exist back then? What poetry scholar would make such a ridiculous claim? It just seemed as if the filmmakers were setting up a straw man that Keating's character could knock down.<br/><br/>Williams does a decent job with the script that he has to work with. The young actors who played the students were also decent, including a young Ethan Hawke. All of the other characters, who include the school principle, as well as the parents of one of the kids who kills himself, are one dimensional caricatures. This kid kills himself because his domineering father won't permit him to act; such frivolous extracurricular activities, the father claims, will interfere with the father's intentions to send his kid to Harvard to become a doctor. Okay, I had one question. Even assuming that the father sees the fine arts as a distraction from more practical concerns, why in the hell would acting in a play hurt his son's chances of going to Harvard? Don't schools value extracurricular activities? In any case, the father's opposition to his son's acting ambitions is wholly disproportionate, as is the son's failure to realize that once he is in college he will be more independent.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that this film had something to say before the emergence of alternative teaching styles, but it just seems incredibly outdated now."

","I loved Dead Poets Society. When I was 14...<br/><br/>Professor Keating looked indeed cool and awesome, the poor kids suffocated by the gloomy and dull school, the frustrated ambitions and the unfulfilled dreams and so on.<br/><br/>Which teenager hasn't dreamt about writing immortal poetry, about having a cool unorthodox teacher, about pursuing his (childish) projects?<br/><br/>The problem with Dead Poets Society lies right there... It's not a deep and insightful movie about teacher-pupils relationship, it's not even a pedagogical movie, it's just a long and plodding teen drama, pandering to an audience of angsty teenagers and angsty parents.<br/><br/>Professor Keating is a fairytale teacher who would and should be kicked out of any school on Earth. Public or preppy, it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>For starters, encouraging to rip some pages off a book just because the teacher doesn't agree with the writer's ideas is not ""good teaching"", let alone ""encouraging free-thought"".<br/><br/>Some would call it fascism, I'll just call it ignorance and arrogance. Even assuming the theory is ridiculous (and I really wonder if such a ""mathematic approach to poetry"" really existed), who does Keating think he is to dismiss a published, and supposedly widely accepted, critical system?<br/><br/>But let's just pretend it's totally fair game having an unknown teacher, or a well-known troublemaker if you wish, trashing decades of teaching/critical theories... The awfulness of the movie doesn't end with that.<br/><br/>Professor Keating isn't teaching a thing. He's just messing with the kids' heads, with the poor excuse of ""living poetry"" and ""expressing themselves"". How THAT will make the kids pass the class of English Literature is beyond me.<br/><br/>Not to mention the fact the teenagers eat up whatever cheesy ""romantic"" drivel they get fed by their Mentor, thus leading to tragedy... Suicide, the cheapest way to garner sympathy for a mono-dimensional character. A suicide that has little ground to stand on, and that seems like a random tool to trigger the even cheaper final.<br/><br/>Poor enlightened Keating must leave the school, and his loyal pupils will just salute him with an emphatic yet empty gesture.<br/><br/>Just empty, formulaic and corny like the whole movie. <br/><br/>The whole movie is basically a cheesy teen melodrama, something that could have been written or recycled for a TV Serial like 90210 or the O.C. The only difference is this movie got Robin Williams and a couple of sappy catchphrases.<br/><br/>Actually the catchphrases are the common thread of Dead Poets Society, the most ""memorable"" and dramatic moments involve a catchphrase... Just like slapstick comedy and teen flicks. Or pro-wrestling...<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is cheap Hollywood neo-romanticism for teenagers and adults who are teens at heart, or for conformist anti-conformists.<br/><br/>The basic idea could have been developed in a much better and more delicate way, but Hollywood just can't help but going full gas with Manichean stereotypes and situations. Thanks to that, we got a very overrated ""masterpiece"" filled with cheap sentimentalism and dime-a-dozen ""thought-provoking"" situations.<br/><br/>Horace is rolling in his cold grave hearing his Carpe Diem being tossed around in such a trivial manner.<br/><br/>Carpe Diem doesn't mean ""do whatever stupid thing you want to"", but more like ""enjoy what you have now, because you don't know what the future holds""<br/><br/>Quite frankly, the suicide goes AGAINST Carpe Diem... The kid kills himself because his (stereotyped) dad doesn't want him to act in a play, so BANG! While the Carpe Diem philosophy would have had the kid to enjoy every second his stint as high school actor, for how long as it would have lasted.<br/><br/>But I'm aware I'm expecting too much from Hollywood..."

","It amazes me how easily people fall for cardboard characters. In real life, it would be impossible to find an educational institution so filled with boorish, vile teachers, and wimpish, intimidated students, with the exception of this one dazzling, inspiring professor. Real life doesn't work that way--no one is as perfect, or perfectly awful, as these people.<br/><br/>But that's not the point. The point is to set up superficial symbols of the prejudices of the audience (the stuffy conservative teachers, the heartlessly strict father, the violent jock), and knock them down with a feather, so that the audience can congratulate itself for its enlightened attitudes.<br/><br/>This is about what I'd expect from Robin Williams, who usually seems to gravitate to roles of this sort. However, other worthy actors fell into this trap, I hope only because a job's a job. Kurtwood Smith is known for playing another tough-guy father, but in ""That 70s Show"" he's a complex character. There, he's always threatening to ""kick ass"", but he's also capable of humor and love; here, he's a pathetic cartoon. But Robin Williams is also a cartoon, just of the opposite kind, a paragon of humanity who can do no wrong, but whom everyone but his rapt students believe is the devil.<br/><br/>How can they write stuff like this? Is this what passes for creativity in Hollywood? I watched this on TCM immediately after the old ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"", and as angelic as the characters in that were, they at least seemed like real people. This script is as manipulative in its own way as ""Death Wish"", trying to provoke the same level of rage toward the symbols of a hated culture. It makes sense when the target is the culture of thuggish gangs who rape and murder, but of prep schools? What's so awful about prep schools? I went to one of the top schools, and believe me, it was a heck of a lot more inspiring than public school. This movie is insulting junk."
"pycckuupokc","4","19","47","28 March 2006"," not as good as the hype makes it out to be...
","I watched this film in English class this past week and I must say that I am a bit disappointed with what I saw. While many aspects of the film were perfectly engaging, I never felt grabbed by the story line, nor was I impressed with the script or, for that matter, actors.<br/><br/>Robin Williams' character was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. While I have always failed to see the reason for the hype Williams so often receives, I have appreciated some of his more serious roles, such as his role as the neurologist in ""Awakenings"". I was completely underwhelmed by Williams' acting in this movie. It was almost as if he was trying too hard to be the ""inspiring"" teacher and in doing so ended up being completely melodramatic, in both his ideals and his voice (he drifted in and out of a VERY annoying accent of some sort.) I'm not entirely sure why Williams was nominated for an Oscar for this role...<br/><br/>The numerous clichés in the film also began to get to me after a while. I truly enjoyed the scenes where the boys were hanging out and talking. These were genuinely acted and scripted and were often very endearing. But the same is not true for the majority of the movie. I felt the teacher's teaching styles were almost too exaggerated for the movie. He would play some sort of game with the kids, they'd learn a lesson, and then be miraculously changed (an example of this was the whole ""carpe diem"" on the first day and how so soon after, everything became inspirational. Another scene that comes to mind is when the teacher helps the shy boy Todd Anderson create his own poetry.) There was no real work involved for this teacher. he uttered a couple of lines of poetry (and the most insipid and well known ones at that) and the boys were then ""thinking for themselves"".<br/><br/>I couldn't see the whole controversy about the ""Society"" itself anyway. Much of what the boys were doing was hanging out in a cave at night. while this was certainly a ""discipline problem"", it hardly seems to pose a threat of any sort to the school.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was overall underwhelmed by this film, but parts of it were OK."

","Many people think this is a great movie, but it isn't.  This movie was incredibly cliche and sappy.  The ending is so dumb I wanted to throw up.  Watch and you will see what I mean.  This movie gets an important idea wrong.  If this teacher was a great one, the students would love the poetry they were reading rather than the teacher himself.  I don't think the kids learned the greatness of the words they were reciting in the movie.  Here are some other things that bothered me:<br/><br/>1. The students weren't good actors with the exception of Ethan Hawke 2.  The scenes where Dead Poet's Society meetings take place are horribly written. 3.  The screenplay takes every easy way out instead of finding a more clever and satisfying solution. 4.  It is full of cliches like the disapproving parent walking in through the back door during their child's big performance. 5.  The love story is stupid, pointless, and distracting. Although I liked one or two scenes, the movie dose not impress me.  If you don't agree, watch the movie carefully, and you'll realize it only tugs at your heart strings because the movie was created to do only that and not to create intelligent afterthought.

"wdbasinger","1","24","65","7 March 2006"," Worst Robin Williams Movie
","This movie could have been an interesting cultural and social statement about students attempting to study literature and to be creative in their own individual ways. But that is not what happens in the movie. Based on my observations of the teacher's attitudes and techniques, everything starts on the wrong foot.<br/><br/>Now, the teacher played by Robin Williams proclaims to the students that one should be free-spirited and to be a seeker after art and truth. That is one of the purposes of poetry. There is nothing wrong with that at all. However, that is not what happens in the movie. The teacher played by Robin Williams encourages students to tear out part of a textbook because he disagrees with the author's comments. When I was a student, there were things that I disagreed with in some books, but I would never tear out the pages. How does tearing out pages of a book with which one disagrees encourage creativity and learning ? Moreover, how does such an action teach a student to respect the views of other people, whether you agree with them or not? This type of action tends to foster intolerance rather than creativity. In addition, in the film, the students are encouraged to ""find their own space"" by wandering around or by standing on top of their desks? This seems to have some value in a psychology experiment, but may have dubious value in a course of English literature.<br/><br/>There is a difference between being ""free-spirited"" on one hand and rebellious on the other. Being ""free-spirited"" implies a desire to explore the unknown and to seek truth and beauty. This does not happen in the movie. Rather, the students decide to use some of the comments that they heard in the class to rebel against and provoke the administration. In once case, one student gets paddled. And for what purpose ? <br/><br/>Next, the film could have been an interesting experiment in synthesizing the different approaches to pedagogy when comparing the ""old school"" structured techniques of the school dean with the ""free spirited"" techniques of the teacher played by Robin Williams, but once again, this does not happen in the movie. Rather, a full-blown adversary relationship develops which ends tragically. As mentioned earlier, the two points of view and systems can be brought together in harmony, but a meeting of the minds does not happen in the film. A vicious spirit of intolerance develops among the protagonists on both sides, not just with the school dean, but among the students as well.<br/><br/>What later develops in the film is a total disaster as the two systems of pedagogy remain at enmity with each other as Robin Williams is eventually forced out of his position at the school. (One reviewer of this movie stated that the Robin Williams character was trying to use the students as ""cannon fodder"" in order to wage some sort of battle with the conservative administration for reason that were unclear. Somehow, I did not pick up on that. If true, then the Robin Williams character deserved to be terminated.) Worst of all still, death becomes a reality when one of the students commits suicide, something which should never have entered the plot. The student commits suicide because of his father's objections over his extracurricular thespian activities. Here, one could have come to some sort of common ground between the ""old school"" attitudes of the father vis-a-vis the ""free spirited"" lifestyle of his son. But, once again, this does not happen in the movie. Instead, the son kill himself, a cowardly act to be sure, something which should never have happened. From here, the plot degenerates at an accelerated rate. The film at this point becomes totally unwatchable.<br/><br/>The teacher played by Robin Williams is not the direct cause of the suicide, but his approach to unrestrained, unstructured pedagogy that borders on nihilism is a factor that leads up to the events that precede the plot's tragedy. I would like to think that the teacher portrayed by Robin Williams had good intentions that went wrong.<br/><br/>Robin Williams has been in better films such as ""Patch Adams"" and ""Goog Morning, Vietnam"". But this film represents his cinematic nadir.<br/><br/>I rated this film 1 out of 10. I would have rated it a total 0 because of the direction of the plot. However, I think 0 out of 10 would still be too generous.<br/><br/>Dan Basinger"

"preppy-3","10","4","7","15 February 2004"," Just great
","In the late 1960s, John Keating (Robin Williams) comes to teach at a prestigous prep school.  His unconventional teaching ways (and his telling them to ""carpe diem""--seize the day) have some strong effects on his students--in particular; Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen) who hates the school; Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is helplessly in love with a girl; Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) who is painfully shy and Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor despite his father's (Kurtwood Smith) refusal. This all leads to a predictable conclusion.<br/><br/>Let's get my complaints out of the way--the story is predictable (how it won an Oscar for Best Screenplay is beyond me) and the tragic turn late in the story is really not needed.  I also didn't believe the final sequence for one second. Also I kept getting the feeling that this was made just to win Oscars.  That aside, this is a great film.<br/><br/>It IS predictable but still is well-written, well-acted and well-directed. Williams (justly nominated for Best Actor) is great.  He tones down his usual over the top personality and underplays his part very nicely.  The teaching sequences with his students are great--a really good one was when he teaches Hawke how to ""write"" a poem.  Also his ""carpe diem"" became a catch phrase for years afterwords.  Hansen is also very good as Dalton as is Charles as Overstreet.  Hawke (who i usually hate) was surprisingly good as Anderson and Leonard is just exceptional as Perry--every time he was on screen I couldn't take my eyes off him.  He's one hell of an actor.  Also Smith is totally evil as a domineering father.  Basically, nobody is bad and they say all their lines with conviction.  Even though I saw everything coming I didn't care--the acting was so good I couldn't stop watching.<br/><br/>The direction by Weir is great.  Two sequences stand out--when Williams is teaching Hawke about the poem and when three of the boys are chasing each other around a room.  Also there are some really beautiful sequences such as the winter ones and when the boys go out in the dead of night for ""society"" meetings.  Incidentally Dead Poets Society is the boys getting together in a cave late at night and reading poetry or telling tall tales to each other. Sounds strange, but it works in the context of the movie.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a 10--I just wish I could get rid of those lingering doubts about WHY this picture was made...I wish it was for the story and the acting, but I don't think it was."

Perhaps it's to do with my age as the film seems to have affected teenagers most (yet I still love 'Catcher in the Rye', 'Heathers', 'Back To The Future' etc). To me, 'Dead Poet's Society' is by no means a terrible film and I appreciate the effort director Peter Weir put into it. Even though I found it to be dull (due to the slow pace), by the time I am slipping away into boredom, a great scene appears right at that moment to bring me 'back to life' and so it continues until the end. What I liked most about this movie are the performances. Norman Lloyd is convincing as the hateful principal. Robin Williams is brilliant but it is the then newcomers, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Hansen who own the movie and hold more than their own opposite the more experienced actors. I enjoyed the scenes of camaraderie and loyalty that existed among the friends. The background score is another plus. I particularly liked how Mike Oldfield's track was utilised. Moreover, there are some very nice visuals, the most powerful one being the scene covered field where Ethan Hawke runs into whiteness, mourning his friend's death. Overall, even though I may not include this among my favourite movies, it's still very watchable."

I didn't expect the suicide scene near the conclusion. 4) Ethan Hawke showed his early star power here as the silent student who wants to be a poet. 5) Robert Sean Leonard pulled in an excellent performance as the student wanting to do things his way. 6) All the supporting performances were well-done and not overacted. 7) The cinematography was crisp and clear.  The scene with the bike going down the hill is the best example I can offer there. 8) This was a movie about a teacher inspiring students and I have a soft spot for films like this. 9) There is a good warning in film about actions having unexpected and very unintentional consequences. 10) The last five minutes are unbelieveable.

I recognised some of the boys angst.  I recognised some of the teacher types - even Keating seemed like only a slightly exaggerated form of one or two teachers I knew.<br/><br/>But the film didn't work.  It seemed manipulative to me.  It didn't grapple with the issues where it mattered.  It was sanctimonious.  It was predictable.  No school that stuffy would have hired such a notorious alumnus to teach.<br/><br/>If you want great stuff on influences on young people and their educational angst, try reading Demian and/or The Glass Bead Game by Herman Hesse.  If elitist schools is your bag, read or see the Harry Potter stuff.

Giving in to social pressure is undeniably prejorative and you must be strong enough to fend for yourself,lest you shall find yourself at crossroads.<br/><br/>The revolutionary and progressive demeanor of Mr Keating is a popularly discussed fact. None other than Robin Williams would've succeeded in immaculately bringing the character to life. One other character that I deeply related with, was that of Todd Anderson, a helplessly anxious and debilitating young boy, embarrassed by what he had to offer. However towards the end of the film, you practically witness the character's metamorphosis into the first person to stand up for what he believes in, letting go of his typically anxious conscience. The closing scene was profoundly inspiring and empowering. It demonstrates the depth of influence Mr Keating had on the young boys. It shows how a difference in perception can bring about huge changes in how you approach life. As eloquent a character Mr Keating is, his expulsion in the end, is a euphemism for how the society as a whole remains attached to what they already know and how collectively reluctant they are to plant a seed of novelty.<br/><br/>Overall, it goes without saying that the movie is a brilliantly executed masterpiece, adorned by the flawless performances by the cast. It definitely is a must watch for those who find it difficult to cope with the tides of societal pressure."

","Having taught English for 43 years, I have stood in the place Robin William's character has. Some days you look out over the herds of kids that pass before you and you cry for them. As a teacher who put his heart and soul into what I did, I tried to make impressions help them master life skills. The sad reality is that one does one's best to crack the numbers game. Every year we have a few of those students who we try to embrace and find the right direction for them, but we are so hamstrung. The first thing I thought when evaluating this film is the little group of kids that he dealt with. He got to know each of them intimately. Of course, it's a prep school, but even then he should have had a couple other full classrooms. What he does is admirable and exciting. That he throws himself into his work to such an extent is amazing. But let's face it. This is a formulaic film that has been done many times before. It is monument building and flying in the face of establishment whose soul purpose is to ruin these kids' lives. There's a kind of narcissism to think that in this group we have bunch of directionless idiots who could never think for themselves. It sends a positive message but the population is carefully put together to send that message. It's just not real."

","This movie has a lot of things going for it. Beautifully filmed in a picturesque location, with excellent performances by Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard. Having not seen this for years, however, some irritating flaws have made themselves known I never noticed before, such as how little Ethan Hawke is actually in it, and how underdeveloped his character is. More time seems to be given to Josh Charles seemingly pointless subplot involving him pursuing a pretty girl. Considering neither have anything interesting to say to each each other except cookie cutter love dialogue, it sort of undermined the more grandiose attempts that Robin Williams was trying to get at. Sure love makes life worth living, but portraying a love story that bland and shallow doesn't really inspire. Would have been better to have some more interactions between Todd and Keating in place of that so their relationship would be given time to grow, we learn more about them, making the conclusion hit as hard as it should. It also would have been nice for the actual meetings themselves to have more of a point and dissect and examine the poems they speak rather than getting them out of the way so they can dance and sing the night away. The intentions and the themes are good, plus the great score and the atmosphere are why this gets a 7, but in a perfect world it would have been a 10 if not for it's frustrating stumbles in the character and plot department."

","After hearing for years people talk how fantastic of a film this is (some would even say one of the best ever made) I finally decided to check it out. While it was enjoyable, it unfortunately failed to have the impact on me it has had on so many others.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of the film is it's performances. Robin Williams is at it's best here showcasing not just his ability as a comedic actor, but also as a dramatic as well. His character is a fascinating one and anyone who has had a teacher or mentor who was inspiring will be able to relate to his character. What really surprised me though was how well the actors portraying the kids were. This is one of the few films I've seen that is focused intensely around a group of young adults were all of the actors do a great job.<br/><br/>While the film has a good story at it's core, it hits so many of the same beats and themes as other coming-of-age films and stories that it pails in comparison to some of the better ones out there. The story takes a while to kick in as the film gets off to a rather slow start and while the actors do a great job, only one or two of the younger characters are actually interesting. Robin Williams really is the star here and when he disappears for too long the film begins to drag quite a bit. I honestly wish the movie had been focused on his character since he was the most interesting, but that's not the story this movie is trying to tell.<br/><br/>For all my complaints, I still found Dead Poets Society to be an enjoyable film. It has fantastic performances, a good message, and features one of the most iconic (and well-deserving) best final scenes in a movie I've ever seen. But there's no denying that it pales in comparison to some other coming-of-age films due to a predictable story that drags in areas. I have a feeling many of the people who adore this film saw it when they were younger which is why it has stuck with them for so long which is perfectly fine, but anyone who has seen other coming-of-age films might find this one a bit underwhelming."

","This cloyingly overlong prep school based drama about a teacher thinking outside the box in 50s America and a mix of conflicted dullards he influenced to literally new heights with tragic consequence seems to meander more than build. When it finally does at nearly two hours grasp some intensity it does so by a quick fix deus ex machina.<br/><br/>Newly arrived John Keating ( Robin Williams) roars into his first year at the staid Welton Academy with some unorthodox ideas. A former student himself he encourages the lads to reform the Dead Poet's Society and seize the day. It all seems rather odd that having gone to the school and understood its highly conservative motto he might take it kind of slow in his first year but hey, no one's gonna get in the way of Robin doing his routine.<br/><br/>Williams is mawkishly idealistic, less zany more zen. Only he could commit an act of Fascist book burning and make it seem nobly liberating. His students are more or less relegated to looking upon him in awe addressing him in hushed tones. Norman Lloyd as the headmaster chews up more than one desk.<br/><br/>Peter Weir's direction lingers rather than soar and the film never achieves much trajectory, just plods in mostly morose adolescent funk. John Searles cinematography is town and country and Maurice Jarrre's music score flush with pompous importance. Dead Poet's Society may not be dead on arrival but it's in critical condition most of the way."
"piksplanet","7","1","1","5 July 2008"," One of my favorite endings...
","Dead Poets Society is not a film for everyone. For people who delve too deep into the meaning of the film, you might find yourself rather cheated or disappointed because of its radical nature. However, if you take it for what it is.. A film that wants to incite the senses to accept change; you will end up getting that warm feeling one gets when having a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly December morning. It works itself up from a simple saying ~ Carpe diem, which is Latin for 'Seize the day'. It is what the new English teacher asks his new 17 year old batch of students to do (in quite a bizarre manner). Together with The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it is one of Peter Weir's best films. The football match with Beethoven in the background, and the climax with bagpipes are the two best sequences in the film. I found Robin Williams' impersonation of Marlon Brando and John Wayne hilarious! Dead Poets Society is a film that has been widely criticized for its ending. You will know why once you've see it. As far as film-making goes, the ending is done perfectly. However, it could mean different things to different people. To challenge your views, to look at things differently, give Dead Poets Society a go. It is based in 1959, so don't give it as hard a time as some critics have given it.<br/><br/>O Captain! My Captain! 7/10. I love the ending."

The rest of the cast - awful, too! Horrible young-artists: unsympathetic faces, no expression, no (sorry) talent. They spell the stupidity and pointlessness of the whole film. <br/><br/>Oh, I forgot, this is probably the point: To have dreams is good; to have a lot of dreams is better; to have too much dreams will finish your sleep... and your life. If that is the point, it is a terrible one!<br/><br/>
However, almost all of the poems in this movie are shapeless. Walt Whittman was a great poet - I love him! But Shakespeare, the Charlatan?

But this you'll still hear thousands of times in your life - without the film, as well.<br/><br/>The movies' love-passage is superfluous! <br/><br/>And the End (SPOILER:) - Baaaad! <br/><br/>What a wonderful class. How they honour their old teacher! They stand up, wow, and climb their tables. Such a great event. But when he needed their help, nobody was on his side. Nobody has the courage to go with him, when he must go. <br/><br/>Now, after the decision stands, the boys are plucky. Congratulations! And the most awful fact: this end wants to be touching!"
"chahlie-1","5","5","12","15 April 2006"," A Shell of Profundity--Please watch it again...It's not as good as you thought
","First, let me recommend Roger Ebert's review on this movie--he generally sums up the problems I have with it. The great American poet Wallace Stevens (who thankfully does not join the list of other great poets bastardised by this movie) wrote many aphorisms in his journals which were published posthumously; in one of those aphorisms he poignantly claimed that ""sentimentality is the failure of feeling."" Dead Poet's Society is cloyingly sentimental. I wince at so many moments: references made to poems that the writers evidently had no deep connection with, scenes contrived for the sole purpose of providing Robin Williams with a stage for his stand-up comedy jokes and impressions, and a suicide motivated by formulaic and totally un-compelling issues. Please watch it again...It's not as good as you thought."
"fatmantinsley6","2","4","9","9 December 2012"," I give it a 2/5
","Movie Review: Dead Poets Society<br/><br/>This movie is about how prep kids stride to have the ability of Carpe Diem (seize the day), but fail epically to achieve Carpe Diem. Like most movies about slogan, it was terrible. However, this one had great acting making you feel as, if you were a fly on the wall. Outside of that, it was terrible. The movie I assume was supposed to be about seizing the day, but at no point did anyone really accomplish anything. OK, maybe that guy did get the girl (typical) demonstrating Carpe Diem, but other than that I was waiting for them to do something. I had my hopes up when Neil did the play in spite of his father, but then when his father decides to pull him out of Winthrop or whatever the school was (I know it started with a W) because of the play instead, of growing a pair and standing up to him, he wussy outs of it and kills himself. Is that what Carpe Diem is supposed to be? Or, when the administration tries to get rid of Mr. Keating, the Dead Poets Society members are each asked to sign a sheet, blaming Neil's suicide on Mr. Keating. Only one of them had to say ""no. We did this on our own free will."" And not signed the sheet and Mr. Keating wouldn't lose his job and the administration would have to continue their witch hunt, but none of them did this. Once, again failing to teach Carpe Diem and making me think of a quote by Eminem in 8 mile ""How can 6 dicks be pussies."" My final point is, the final scene in this movie is supposed to be inspirational, it's not. The equal of this scene is a plan to save the world after, the world has been destroyed. My teacher told me not to give away the end. So, I won't but the scene is basically students standing on desk saying ""o captain, my captain"" with inspirational music in the background. Like, I said ""terrible"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, if this movie didn't have good acting it would be unwatchable. And the acting that stood out to me is by two actors Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) and Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) and rest are good, making the story believable. I give it a 2/5 only because of the acting."

","After all the hoopla, what really happens in this movie?  One kid kills himself, a teacher loses his job, and the system remains the same.  Why does the kid shoot himself?  Because he has a stock character of a dad that doesn't understand his son's desire to wear tights and spout poetry.  What is a lad to do?  Try and really stand up to dad?  No.  Try and talk to mom or another sympathetic ear that might be able to sway dad?  No. Run away from home until dad realizes he made a mistake?  No... wait, I got it: Blow your own skull off!   And what about the lad's mentor?  The teacher who dared to defy the system and take the fall?  All the desk stomping and Shakespearean one-liners didn't save his job or reputation in the end.  He leaves and the system wins again.  So did anything really change in this movie?  Doesn't really seem that way.   A couple kids were more ""enlightened"" I guess.  But how?  Ethan Hawke, whom I presume is the protagonist, watches his one pal kill himself in an act of cowardly selfishness, and his star teacher get crushed by the bureaucracy. <br/><br/>
This film was moving when I was in high school, but later viewings made me feel as if I'd been had. The film seemed to work for many people though. ""Oh Captain, My Captain"" was the equivalent of the filmmakers saying, ""Cry, audience people!  Cry!"". It certainly is affective among the those ""poor"", ""misunderstood"" souls, as I felt when I was 14.  Fortunately now, I know better."

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Robin Williams is obnoxious in this one, the characters don't have much personality or development, and nothing ever really happens. And, please, you don't learn a thing about poetry, not even about anything. This movie is pointless.

","I can see why Roger Ebert would include this in his book of most reviled movies. Overall it just seemed really unrealistic and oozes with sentimentality to the point of nausea. Now don't get me wrong, Robin Williams is a great comedian, but his socially aware movies like this one and Patch Adams (which, if you think about it, are extremely similar) tend to make me gag. Also, why is every adult in this movie besides Williams 100% pure eeeeevil? The rest of the faculty at the prep school, every parent, even the janitors are these horribly bitter, mean souls who have nothing better to do than scowl at the screen. It's just a wee bit one-sided, is all I'm saying. And I found it hard to sympathize with Williams' character because his peers actually made some good points. Sure, it's one thing to encourage your students, but at a certain point things can get out of hand. Now comes my big speech about the main plot point: Neil's suicide. I had NO IDEA this was coming at me when I saw this character putting on his Shakespearean crown of thorns and walking to his dad's office. My classmates and I joked about him possibly axing his father (who had forbidden him to become an actor because he is eeevil), or axing himself, but we didn't think it would actually happen. And I just laughed out loud at the father's reaction to seeing his son and how the director handled it. Hint, it's in slow motion and he screams, ""Noooooooooo!"" Very cheesy. Then there is the ending, where Williams gets fired, half of the students get expelled, and the audience is supposed to believe that standing on your desks fixes everything. Sorry, but your teacher is still fired kids, and guess what? Now you have detention for standing on the desks! All in all, a sappy melodrama that lasted way too long, with about 100 lackluster subplots and too many characters. 1/4 stars"

I have greatly enjoyed Peter Weir's work - ""The Truman Show"" and ""Witness"" are among my favorite films. But ""Dead Poets Society"" just bothers me.  I appreciate the theme, I appreciate the idea of a teacher who inspires his students.  I just can't stand being hit over the head with it every few seconds.  I can't stand the plastic characters.<br/><br/>But what really gets to me is this - there's a strange sense of defeatism about this movie.  As much as it would purport to advocate individuality, it seems to advocate the belief that individuality can only lead to ruin.  Take a long look at the fate of some of the major characters and think about how much the filmmakers really believe in the positive power of unconventional thinking.<br/><br/>In the end, the whole thing just seems forced to me, I guess.  It's like the writer decided upon Point A and Point B for his characters, and simply figured out a way to railroad them all from A to B, instead of letting anything develop naturally."

","The film stars the late Robin Williams, which is already a treat, as Mr. Keating - with charm of comedy and with, his dialogue exercises love for poetry and, more importantly, life itself. Using the unorthodox teaching methods to make his students think for themselves, exploring the whole concept of ""Carpe Diem"" and focusing on different viewpoints for every poem or even everyday situation, that's just a part what Mr. Keating managed to do in short span of about 2 hour runtime but those ideas stick in your mind.<br/><br/>One of the main characters, a student named Neil Perry, who was played by Robert Sean Leonard, is an academic prodigy but he also dreams of pursuing acting. Unfortunately, his parents disagree with this decision and would rather force him to seize the opportunity they'd given their son to become a doctor. Neil, deciding to seize the day, still pursues his dreams and after a successful play, where he emerged as a young rising talent, he is brought down to the ground by his parent who instead only feel disappointment for his sons disobeying actions. Neil, feeling like he was just a dog, whose only purpose is in life was to follow his parents will like a dog, decides to end it right there and ends his life. No doubt, this was the saddest moment of the movie. His father might be happy because Robert Sean Leonard, who portrayed Neil, ended up being a doctor in a hit TV series ""House"" 15 years later but his strict behavior without any freedom of his choices for his son just cost him a son. The key underlying theme, following this movie, was to make your own choices. Poetry can't be measured with math, creativity can't be bred in a strict classroom and you'll never think for yourself if you just follow other people's will.<br/><br/>""Things in life ain't always quite what they seem / There's more than one given angle to any one given scene / So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene / On any one given angle, on any one given scene"" - I think this short little verse from ""Angles"", performed by Scroobious Pip, can sum up the movie quite well - Mr. Nolan, the headmaster of the fine institution, blames Mr. Keating for the death of Neil while in reality Mr. Keating is the one who opened Neil's eyes. Todd, who underwent the biggest character transformation in the movie, is also a good example for that verse since he started out as a shy kid who didn't believe he had any talent or courage but display them both in fascinating manner when his poetic genius slipped out of his conscience for a brief moment during exercise with Mr. Keating or when he stood his ""ground"" at the finale of the movie."

","Whether its a teacher or a parent, gaps in communications with those who are supposed to teach and mentor us, can render the whole learning process meaningless. so having a teacher knowing exactly the hardships students of Welton Academy go through, who tries to bridge this gap can really affect these students' way of thinking.
Dr. Keating -portrayed by the brilliant Robin Williams- decided to discard the creativity-depriving teaching methods used in literature that are aiming at making it into a science that can be translated to rules and equations, and to plant a seed of individuality and opinion based thoughts in the minds of his students, and to teach them to seize the day and give their lives meaning or 'Carpe Diem'.
I loved watching the enthusiastic teacher interact with his students, where every lesson was one that you learn from experiencing life with everything it has to offer, and every lesson can change the way you live your life. But they weren't just words these lessons,every single one of them was given with the utmost care and delivered in a creative manner.
I also loved how the students started living their lives after that, how realizing their own mortality gave more value to the time they had on earth, a thought that should never leave any of our heads, displayed by these young boys in a very daring and entertaining manner.
Of course this display of character growth was allowed due to the amazing performances of Robert Sean, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles and Gale Hansen. All of which of course pale in comparison to Robin Williams' inspiring performance that can inspire even the viewers of the movie let alone the students.
And of course many of the scenes of the movie are heart-warming from the teacher providing guidance to his students, to students seizing the day, to a memorable movie ending. I was surprised by the dark and realistic turn of events that happened but it gave the movie and the ideals it inspires a link to the real world.
the soundtrack however is barely noticeable with the exception of a few scenes like the ending, and the fact that the death of Neil was due to his own lack of will to communicate with his father, of course the harshness of his father was a major cause but at that night that was his chance to finally communicate with his father but he didn't, so at least he died after finishing his master piece to immortalize something that he loved into this world.
I highly recommend this movie for everyone its really enjoyable, full of great scenes and is full of inspirational quotes, but as you watch it don't wait for events and plots, just strap back and enjoy the ride."

","A very fine film well worth two hours of your life - you won't be checking your watch for one moment, such is the quality and of the seamless screenplay, direction and performances.<br/><br/>It is reminiscent of the magnificent ""If"", as far as being a portrayal of an establishment-fodder factory is concerned, and of many classic ""schooling"" films such as ""Blackboard Jungle"" (1955) and ""From Sir With Love"" (1967) in its theme of the heroic committed teacher going the extra miles purely out of conscientiousness.<br/><br/>It is however curious that the scripwriter could not find a better aphorism for independence of mind and non-conconformity - even admittedly in the context of a repressed and repressive institution such as the college portrayed - than ""caveat emptor"", an ethos associated more closely with self indulgence than with due principled rebellion against stultifying pseudo-conservative tradition. They are strange people, scriptwriters. At least this film got - unusually - a rousing, meaningful and convincing ending.<br/><br/>Like the stellar ""One Flew Over a Cockoo's Best"", it is remarkable that the producer and director managed to find an enlightened relevant institution willing to overlook the implied slight to itself too, lend itself to the project and supply its grounds (and, incredibly, in OFOTCCN, its staff and patients too) for it.<br/><br/>This is Robin William's finest performance, worthy of renown. As with other films employing teenage actors, most notably ""American Graffiti"" (1973), it's always interesting to spot the faces who became big. As, in ""From Sir to Love"" it was Lulu, here it's Ethan Hawke, primarily - scenes with Lara Flynn Boyle apparently having been deleted."

","""Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence,"" the students of Welton Academy recite unanimously before taking a seat in the assembly hall. These 4 pillars serve as the foundation for this prestigious all-boys preparatory school, but they are better known in the minds of the students to be ""travesty, horror, decadence, excrement"", as they later say in a mocking tone. The students endure countless difficult classes and high standards, but their lives are changed when the schools hires a new english teacher, Mr. John Keating. The growth and dynamic of the students are well presented, and combined with the lovable characters and heartfelt lessons, the Dead Poets Society presents a message applicable to any audience.
Robin Williams is casted to play the part of Mr. John Keating, the beloved English teacher in this movie. He is well suited for the role because of the sharp contrast he presents compared to the other teachers at the school. The beginning of this movie takes the audience through a typical day for the students: old, stern teachers piling mountains of work and stress on the students. The boys handle class after class of overwhelming standards until they arrive at Mr. Keating's class. Firstly, Robin Williams is significantly younger than the other teachers in the movie, and has a softer natural expression that gives away his silly personality. In their first class, he walks through the rows of seated students, whistling the 1812 Overture, before asking the students to follow him out of the classroom. From taking the class outside and around the campus for their lessons, to demanding they rip out the first chapter of their textbook because of how close-minded it is, and even asking that the students refer to him as ""O captain, my captain"", a quote from a Walt Whitman poem, Mr. Keating is nearly the complete opposite from the other teachers at the academy. He has an almost childlike personality, and yet possesses so much enlightening wisdom about life, allowing him to grow close with his students while still earning their respect and attention.
The movie opens with the students pouring into the school to begin a new school year, some saying tearful goodbyes to their parents at the gate. It is clear that most of them are not particularly fond of the school, but rather are forced to attend under their parents' high standards. Neil Perry is one example. His naturally cheery, friendly personality quickly earns him the audience's love. To many, he is the embodiment of the perfect friend and student, but to his father, he is seen as a disappointing son who can't get his priorities straight. Mr. Keating recognizes his passionate spirit and is the one to encourage Neil to pursue acting, even though his father is persistent he gets rid of all distractions in order to become a doctor. When his father demands he quit as the editor for the school's annual, Neil smiles painfully and complies. After many classes with Mr. Keating and truly embodying the motto he says nearly every class, ""Carpe Diem"" (seize the day), Neil goes against his dad's wishes and joins the school play as the lead. He learns to stand up for himself a bit more and ends up discovering one of his true passions.
For me, a memorable scene from this movie was their first meeting as the Dead Poets Society. The group of boys huddle together in a small cave somewhere off campus, and read from the book, Five Centuries of Verse, which was known to be the traditional opening for all of their meetings. They alternate from reciting light-hearted poems to dark, haunting ones, with the cameras sharply cutting from one poem to the next. The pace of the readings get quicker as they go on, and eventually the camera is spinning in the center of their circle, as they chant, some singing and some playing instruments, all while dancing around the camera. In this manner, they leave the cave with songs belting from the top of their lungs, showing a passion they previously haven't had the chance to express at the school. This scene is later paralleled when Neil's roommate, Todd Anderson, is stressed out about a poetry assignment in Mr. Keating's class. Neil comes in and tries to read Todd's poem, grabbing the paper from him and running around their cramped bedroom. At first, it seemed that Todd was genuinely upset and that a fight would break out. However, as they circled the room over and over, jumping across from one bed to another with the camera spinning to follow them, the tone quickly averted to a light, playful one. A few other boys joined in the circle with one playing on the harmonica, re-adding the element of music into the scene. It quickly came to resemble the earlier scene in the cave, representing how much the boys have grown closer and become more open to messing around and exploring their true selves.
The Dead Poets Society is an amazing movie for teenagers as well as those reminiscing back to when they were attending school. It can be easy to lose sight of what's important in life when people are busy planning their futures or stressing out about work. However, this movie shows how essential it is that we stop to appreciate life. It emphasizes how one teacher could change the lives and perspectives of these students, opening them up to appreciate the art of poetry and to explore the creative sides of themselves at such a critical point of their lives."

","The film was published before the book. The book based on the screenplay. It was published in 1959. It plays in Vermont.
The film ""Dead Poets Society"" is about a school called ""Walton Academy"" where boys are taught very strictly and with a lot of discipline. But there is one teacher who teaches the students to be free thinkers. He does not care about consequences.
A large roll is John Keating who is played by Robin William. He is a young English teacher who is different from the other teachers. He tries to inspire the students. His motto is ""Seize the day"". Also important is he Headmaster Mr. Noland. He is a contraire to Mr. Keating because he is very strict and traditional. The most important student is Neil Perry. He is a boy who is like a leader of his friends. His father puts a lot of pressure on him. Neil suffers under this.
In my point of view the way of Mr. Keating's teaching is a good way because he is open minded and motivating. He wants that the students live their life extra ordinary. They should have an own point of view. That is what I like.
The film is well accomplished, because it shows how a very strict school is. Moreover you can imagine better what you really want in life. You are stimulated to think more about your life. Maybe you change something in your life because you remember that it is not imagination.
I can recommend watching the film. It isn't a predictive film because it has a surprising turn. This film never gets boring. To sum up one can say that the film has a great motto ""Seize the day"" and this is relevant for everyone's life. Everybody can be someone great. You only have to try it. So watch the film and learn from it."

Besides that, he puts more value on talking about something than just copy and write something.

","Inspirational movie to watch at all ages. ''Dead Poets Society'' was directed by Peter Weir and produced Steven Haft, Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas.
It has been published in 1989 and has a total length of 123 minutes.
The movie ist about a boys school in Vermont which is named Welton Academy. Most of the teaching is done in a very strict way because of the four pillars of the school. The new english teacher Mr. Keating wants the boys to be free thinkers without thinking of the consequences.
The main actor Robin Williams, who plays the role of John Keating fits perfectly in his role. Robert Sean Leonard as Neil Perry, Ethan Hawk as Todd Anderson, Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet and last but not least Gale Hansen in the role of Charlie Delton represent their characters very well, despite their youth.
In our opinion this movie is a great way to rethink your current decisions in order to live a joyful life. While watching this movie you'll think about how you can make your life extraordinary and it shows what an impact your words can have on people. For example how Neil reacts to his fathers words.
The director's intention is have an impact on peoples lifes in order to seize their days and that they've got a life to live. He wants that we think about the stories that we could tell in our future because we are maybe for some people an idol.
We would recommend the movie because of its great story and amazing message behind it."

Did you ever think about the days you wasted with things which weren´t worth your time ? How short your life could be ? Are you aware of the fact that time is something you can´t buy, change or repeat ? Now you are thinking ""Of course, everybody knows that"" but do you think that you know the worth of it ?
You should watch the ""Dead Poets Society"" because this movie will show you something you probably didn´t see or realise until now.<br/><br/>The movie ´Dead Poets Society´ starring Robin Williams is based on a real teacher who taught the screenwriter Tom Schulman.
It is about a traditional and strict school where a lot of pressure is put on it´s students. Mr Keating, the new English teacher inspires the boys with literature but doesn´t think about the dramatical consequences this could have.<br/><br/>There are a lot of interesting characters in the movie but there are three characters which are really inspiring to me. First there is Keating of course. He inspires his students to come out of themselves and to think about the important things in life. Then there is Neil Perry. He has a strong personality and because of Keating he gets more self confident during the movie. He is popular but doesn´t get conceited, he helps others and can stand against the crowd. And then there´s Todd. I like this character the most because I can identify myself with it. Todd is a shy person and definetly not the type to be a a leader. He has a lot to say but he is scared of others. He is scared that they are going to make fun of him or that his voice will get lost in the crowd.<br/><br/>Even if it´s not the type of movies I normally watch I think it´s a movie you should have watched at least once in your life. It points out some important things about life and you shouldn´t miss that.
The director wants to show how important every day we live, every thought we have and every step we do can be and we should open our eyes and realise that this movie is a message to all of us that we should finally wake up and live!
So make sure you watch it and think about it."

","Dead Poets Society criticizes the strict, orthodox teaching methods, by using the Welton Academy in Vermont as a representative. Mr. Keating, an English teacher, teaches his students to be free-thinkers, without mentioning the consequences.
That way the movie does not only criticize tradition but also teaches the risks of Carpe Diem (Seize the day).<br/><br/>It features Robin Williams as John Keating, Norman Lloyd as Headmaster Gale Nolan, Kurtwood Smith as Mr. Perry, George Martin as Dr. Hager and many more.<br/><br/>John Keating is played very convenient by Robin Williams.
He plays the role of a modern, calm teacher and mirrors the future of teaching.<br/><br/>This movie is great, if you want to learn about Carpe Diem but also want a proving example why it is not always right and that you have to know the consequences.<br/><br/>Movies to watch after Dead Poets Society are:
-Good Will Hunting (1997)
-Sixteen Candles (1984)
-Dazed and Confused (1993)

The director (Peter Weir) does a great job at playing with your emotions; at one point you'd be smiling and happy for John Keating's students, and other times the movie will leave you in tears.
Not only does John Keating teach you about looking at poetry from different perspectives, but he also teaches you too look at life in a whole other perspective.
This movie shows how even the rich don't have it easy. Their parents choose their life for them and those parents don't let their children have a say in what they want to do. You can see this with everyone but especially with Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) and his father Mr. Perry (Kurtwood Smith). Neil wants to act, and his father already knows what he wants to Neil to do, and he ruins Neil's life.

Ethan Hawke played Todd Anderson amazing, he played a boy who starts shy then slowly becoming an loud good reader.

","This is probably one of the best coming of age films I've ever seen. The anti-authority themes are just so excellent, and the fact that you could argue very easily that Keating was a negative influence on the kids makes the movie that much better to me. It comes off as a little preachy (poetry is great, whatever), but we can also see how Neil's parents may be right about a few things, the dean/head of the school was also fairly reasonable if you look at it without the like, ""main character bias"" or whatever you want to call it.<br/><br/>I think I liked it so much because I used to be like the kids in the film. I used to think movies, tv, books, and ESPECIALLY poetry were a total waste of time. I was focused entirely on science, math, school, tests, stuff like that. My Keating is also an English teacher(s). My Junior and Senior year English teachers encouraged me to read and enjoy it so much more than anyone else in my life. So when I watch this movie, and I see Keating on screen, I'm thinking of my own English teachers (even though they're definitely a lot less intense). <br/><br/>Problems with the film? Not many, but, there were a few. I felt like it was a bit melodramatic at times. No high school aged kids are going to be talking like this in real life, it's definitely over dramatized. The authoritative characters are exaggerated as well, in my opinion. This is all ok though, the plot, acting (especially from Williams), and themes really worked out well for me, I loved them. I'd have to watch the movie again to point out more flaws, on first watches of films I , and I think most people, have a much more positive view than they would after further reflection or rewatches. I think the mark of a really good movie is that it improves as you think about it more (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Schindler's List, and Apocalypse Now being my favorite examples). <br/><br/>I really liked this movie. I think I could consider it one of my favorites for now. All the themes just resonate with my own life so well."

"SimonJack","7","0","0","22 June 2018"," A question of justice misdirected
","The acting in ""Dead Poets Society"" is very good all around. The plot is an interesting one. It's the type of story that Robin Williams liked doing for much of his career. His characters mostly are far from the ordinary, usual, or everyday people. Often, they are played for the sympathy of the audience. And, that's okay - to an extent. When the character is a hero who does something for the good of others, or thinks of others, he is the proverbial ""good guy. <br/><br/>One thinks of such films in which Williams starred. ""Awakenings"" of 1990 was a fine movie, as was ""Patch Adams"" of 1998. Williams was superb in ""Jakob the Liar"" of 1999. But is his John Keating such a person in this film? It's one thing to encourage students to be themselves, to become original, to pursue their dreams. But without the attention to those students, their characters and situations, the teacher ducks responsibility for himself or herself. Then, his uniqueness or difference in methods is really more self-centered. It's not a true interest in the students for their welfare and well-being. <br/><br/>The end of this film is melodramatic, and a way for the students to overcome their disgrace at lying. It never is clear why they would need to be off the hook for anything themselves. Obviously, the institution wanted to find a scapegoat, and the father wanted a culprit. Keating seems to accept the class salute at the end as a good sign and squaring of the students with him. But that doesn't remove his complicity. How much guilt did he feel or show for what happened? Would a teacher who really cared for his students have not been more aware and interested to see that something so drastic as this didn't happen to someone in his class? Would such a death have ever occurred, had he not encouraged his students to be bold, to challenge authority and family?<br/><br/>This is one film in which Williams could have played a character who owns up to a failure in responsibility. Instead, one is treated to a tutor who is put upon for being unjustly dismissed. Was his career more important than the life of any one of his students? Where is the justice when a student takes his own life?"
"kaustavmajumdar","8","0","0","30 April 2018"," You must live before you die. You must be an individual above that will bring you down.
","Dead Poets Society is absolute success in the portrayal of the truth of the individual, their individuality and the society that was formed on the back of it. The Western and every other First World Country is based in that idealism and through that achievement, pioneers and true champions have been born again and again.
The thing about DPS that I do appreciate is also want deeply haunts me that despite it's idealism, very rarely does anything slip by the realists - very much like reality. That truth is so debilitating messed up that it is almost akin to the realization that according to the stats and surveys produced, no matter what you have chosen to believe, most of us would have ended up as the accomplice to the oppression in the Holocaust than be the Hero whose list would be topic of an Oscar winning Biopic. I don't care that you think I may have overstretched my analogy because it is very much the truth in both counts. But getting back to the story, the realism wins out in those moments when Robert Sean Leonard's character chooses quicker incumbency of the inevitable grasp of death than rather face the futility and frustration of living his parents' dreams. This is also a recurrence when Robin William's (RIP, you brilliant and magnificent legend; I have no idea what you thought in the last moments of your days but if I could, I would tell you that every breath that you ever took was completely worth it and you left the world a better world than when you came into it and it was no so because it was inevitable but because you chose to make it better for those whose lives were touched by yours. So, thank you in addendum to anybody who ever made your life better and brought a smile to you) Keating is fired and students are left helpless to do anything about it till the last when they defy their necessary conformity to the school. But even then, the movie ends out an melancholic breezy high which could only be managed by the ambiguity of shot being cut then and there with a final display of approval. That is what is impressive about this movie that there is a definite parallel established in the story because of the world that exists and the world that should exist. It is beautiful in an haunting re-imposition of reality and its dread that we must fight everyday. 
It will also be close to my heart because of:
1) How close I feel to Neil Perry (RSL) because I could identify with the frustration he fought and lost. It makes me want to face the rough hands I have had in my life a little bit harder. I want to live and be happy in the way of Keating, but should I fail and can't get back up, let this be my self-implicated obituary - I have loved living. I have had good times and I have cherished each one of those, so much so that you could say I sucked the 'marrow out of those bones' whenever and however I could. Unfortunately, I must have more bad shit happen that I couldn't fight or became too cowardly against. I would like to apologize for that, I didn't mean to hurt anybody anymore. Perhaps, most of all, myself was the top of the list. I may have hated quite a few people because my Idealism and weaknesses and loved a lot more because of how much love I felt I had to give and also, of my perpetual, ever-lingering loneliness. I don't know if I feel those anymore, I don't if I want or want to give forgiveness and lastly, if there is even a beyond. I sincerely hope not, one life is all we have and it should all we get; peace and unknowing in the everlasting is all that I seek anymore if I have chosen this path. Take care, be well and value life while you have it and can still make good on its promises, honestly. Only a dead man can tell you the truth of that.
2) It contradicts on almost every story in Indian Film Industry that has been made on this topic (it might be slightly poetic that I am obsessed that I am so obsessed with pain, living in The City of Joy; Then again, Pain is a binary of Joy - Each the more building itself where the other chooses frequent). Indian movies are more emotional, more optimistic and dramatic in their flair that people will actually make the choices that Perry couldn't and people like the Perry parents and the Headmaster will actually take a chance on him and forgive him. This movie shows another very possible side of that scenario and I can appreciate that. Overall, I still do prefer movies with hopeful portrayals because if there is one thing we need some more almost everyday, it is hope. The hope that the unlikely, harder choice which may lead to a positive outcome after toil should still be fought for no matter how hard it is; which, I honestly know, easier said than done but I really wanted Perry to fight one more day even if it was and not have gone quietly into night - Rage, Rage against the dying light (I am paraphrasing Dylan Thomas's poem about this subject which was dedicated to his father). <br/><br/>You will watch it. You need just someone to tell you that you will be alright. I will be that person and it is gonna be okay and I think you will find a more fervent desire to live life better and better yet as an definitive individual after you have watched it.<br/><br/>
P.S. - Should be anybody be interested in checking out the more optimistic portrayals of the style of story DPS pursued, here are the names - Mohabbatein & 3 Idiots"

","It's with a sad sense of irony that one watches the film today, knowing that Robin Williams took his own life at the age of sixty three a few years ago. No one can truly know what personal demons another person faces daily to bring about such a tragic event. His suicide defied all rationality to anyone who followed his career and he is sadly missed.<br/><br/>I think everyone deserves a teacher like John Keating at least once during their time in school. I came close, there was a teacher in my high school who was as well regarded as Mr. Keating but I was not in one of his classes. Yet he was a personal favorite and always took the time to chat when the opportunity presented itself. Insisting that one learns to think for themselves is probably the most valuable lesson any teacher can inspire, and when that lesson takes hold, you have the triumphant acknowledgment that that teacher is not only a capable instructor, but a valued human being as well.<br/><br/>I've seen this film a number of times and it always manages to impress. You can see the young men of Welton Academy mature as students and as individuals over the course of the story. The death of Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) certainly strikes a discordant note, but serves to dramatize the inner turmoil one faces when forced to accept outcomes that don't come from the heart. It was unfortunate that he could not seize the day in his own good time, while attempting to conform to his father's accepted principles of Welton - 'Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence'. There should have been some room left over for Humanity."

(Robin Williams)
<ul><li>In a boarding school, the Wilton Academy, where the students are studying, the professor enters the life of the Academy students</li></ul>To inspire them to love life and change their lives forever, when it makes them think in a different unconventional way and with a lot of rebellion.
The film contains a collection of beautiful poetry quotations ..
Including the quote from a poem by the English poet Robert Helek:
""Gather the buds as long as you can, the old time is still flying, and the same flower that smiles today will die tomorrow""
The film also contains a lot of wonderful ideas .. Of which the professor said to his students:
""We do not read and do not write poetry because it is funny, we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race, and the human race is full of emotion.
Medicine, law, business administration, engineering .. is a noble and important character in order to preserve life
But poetry is beauty, romance, love, these are the things we live for. ""
And the beautiful film also:
That he knows them on the slogan ""Carpi Diem,"" which is Latin means ""nest your day""<br/><br/>And teaches them how to ""extract the essence of life"" from every moment, how to think for themselves and choose their own way<br/><br/>Even if he is uneducated or strange, to have the courage to defend their ideas and beliefs, to face the power that is trying to paint<br/><br/>Their way and their future without any consideration for their feelings and emotions."

","An inspiring, endearing & emotionally stimulating tale that's further strengthened by a surprisingly down-to-earth performance from Robin Williams, in addition to the spot-on chemistry between its young cast, Dead Poets Society is an affectionately crafted, skilfully directed & smartly scripted work that only asks its viewers to dream more urgently & live more fervently.<br/><br/>The story takes place in an all-male prep school during 1959 and follows a group of students who are encouraged to unleash their creative side by their new English teacher, a former alumni of the school. As he inspires them to look at poetry & life with a different perspective, his students restart the unsanctioned Dead Poets Society club and begin challenging the status quo.<br/><br/>Directed by Peter Weir, the film introduces all the relevant characters in the opening scene but it takes a while to get acquainted with most of them and separate one from another. However, once their English class begins, and their new teacher's unorthodox methods unlock their true potential, it turns into an enjoyable, entertaining & thoroughly nostalgic drama that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.<br/><br/>The atmosphere, for the most part, is infused with a positive, creative & optimistic vibe and all the moments featuring Robin Williams is a delight to watch. The fine dynamic between its young actors makes them convincing as a group, and their individual contribution is no slouch either. Camera is operated in a smooth, static fashion. Editing is controlled, unfolding the narrative at a steady pace, while its score adds flavours of its own into the final print.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Dead Poets Society features a wonderful cast in Robin Williams, Josh Charles, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Norman Lloyd & others, with Williams impressing the most. It's a finely measured & highly grounded effort from Williams who as John Keating delivers a performance that arguably ranks as his best. And he is brilliantly supported by the rest of the cast who all play their part with flair, both individually and as a group.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Dead Poets Society is a wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama that tries to illustrate the importance of finding one's true passion in life and embracing it wholeheartedly. It packs plenty of laughs over the course of its runtime, and fine dose of tears as well but at its heart, Dead Poets Society is all about making your lives extraordinary. And the only way to do that is by following your heart, pursuing your dreams & continue seizing every day. Delightfully recommended."

","Dead Poet's Society, directed by Peter Weir, investigates the lives of a group of male students who attend Welton Academy, a highly conservative, rigorous boarding school in Vermont. Their English poetry teacher, Mr. Keating, inspires them through his unconventional methods of teaching to reestablish a ""Dead Poet's Society"" at their school, in which they gather to recite poetry and ""suck the marrow out of life"". Some may argue that Dead Poet's Society's themes of depression and suicide make the movie too morbid for young viewers. Others, including notorious movie critic Roger Ebert, may insist that the overrated movie has a tired and predictable plot; of course the innovative, non-comforting teacher will change the lives of his students and be fired by the traditional, ancient headmaster. However, I insist that this movie's heartfelt message, exploration of common teenage experiences, and inspirationally crafted characters make this film one of my favorites. Moreover, the film's actors and relatability makes Dead Poet's Society one of the greatest coming of age movies ever made.<br/><br/>The actors in Dead Poet's Society make this film exceptional. The perfectly cast Robin Williams, who takes the role of Mr. Keating, blends humor, inspiration and sentiment to gorgeously execute his character. When Mr. Keating brings up lines from Shakespeare, he quirkily performs impressions of other famous actors spouting lines, incorporating the lovable nature of Robin Williams into the character. However, in an instant, Williams can just as easily spout words full of hope and inspiration that bring tears to my eyes. His ability to evoke such a multitude of emotions in viewers makes the film incredible to watch. Robert Sean Leonard, who plays Neil Perry, one of the boys who yearns to pursue an acting career despite his father's plans for him to become a doctor, has an amazing performance in this film. His versatile acting, which includes portraying Puck from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" within the movie and exploring the darkness of depression and failure, suck the audience into the plot and his character's journey. These actors create an attachment from the audience, which in part makes the film successful.<br/><br/>The relatable scenarios in Dead Poet's Society appeals to the viewers' sense of sentiment. Robin William's character, Mr. Keating, encourages his English students to savor every moment in life and put themselves in uncomfortable situations to help them discover their inner passions. He often asks his students to stand on desks to prove everything can be perceived from a different perspective and walk around while a beat plays to show how easily they tend to walk with the beat and, therefore, lay victim to conformity. As an audience member, I, along with many others, can relate to having an awe-inspiring teacher that taught beyond the classroom. Mr. Briguglio, my tenth grade English teacher, often recited Mr. Keating's favorite phrase, ""Carpe Diem,"" or seize the day, when encouraging us to go out into the world and live with vitality and drive. While we explored literature, not only did we discuss the books' themes and characters, but we also asked ourselves philosophical questions and often went off on tangents exploring human tendencies and personal experiences. Mr. Briguglio created a safe classroom environment, similar to Mr. Keating's, where students could fearlessly open up about their passions or worries. My experiences allowed the messages in Dead Poet's Society to deeply resonate with me because I could relate to these boys as their teachers completely changed their interpretation of learning and outlook on the future. This made this film extremely enjoyable for me to watch.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best coming of age movies because its inspirational messages evokes hope and curiosity in its audience. Mr. Keating's frequent invigorating spiels that encourage us to chase our dreams serve as a beacon of hope and optimism for his audience members. I was personally left with chills, feeling invincible and and as if I had somehow joined the Dead Poet's Society myself, unlocking new ways of perceiving the world and encountering life. The blend of tragedy, struggle, humor, warmth, love, and invaluable wisdom that this film harbors truly makes it a movie worth your time."

","""The Dead Poets Club"" is one of the films that have marked me the most in my life, in the sense that it presents a philosophy and a way of understanding human existence, which I think we should all follow at the foot of the letter. The character who so masterfully represents Robin Williams, offers us the guidelines and the keys to a full development and a vision of life, where there always reigns optimism, joy, good humor and honorability. Take advantage of the moment, do not get tired of repeating the teacher protagonist and that is what we should do at all times, stay with the good and discard the bad, not give up, fight for the ideals and at the end of everything, when the days are we can exhaust ourselves, be able to look back and think calmly, that truly, our passage through this world left some trace, since we took the opportunity to live. It is worth trying to be happy in this valley of tears. A work of art in short and a real wonder from all points of view, so if there is still someone who has not seen it, it is taking too long. <br/><br/>Carpe Diem, comrades!"

","I saw this movie a couple of times over the years, it made an indelible memory. Especially the last scene where each boy, in turn, stood on his desk, defying orders from the old headmaster. Now I was able to watch it again on Netflix streaming movies.<br/><br/>This certainly is one of our landmark movies. Set in 1959 former student at the elite private boys high school, Robin Williams as John Keating, returns to teach. Classroom scenes focus on his poetry class. We find out from his photo in the old yearbook that he was a rebel of sorts, willing ""to try anything"", and perhaps it is a mystery why the staid old school, valuing discipline and tradition, hired him. <br/><br/>Keating's main focus is to get the young boys (all the actors were in fact teenagers during filming) to learn to think for themselves. Carpe diem. Seize the day. But that invariably runs up against school administration and some of the parents. When Keating was a student he was a member of an unofficial club ""Dead Poets Society."" Upon learning about this a group of his students on their own reestablish this club.<br/><br/>The tragic figure is Robert Sean Leonard as Neil Perry with a strict father who was determined his son would become a doctor. But his son really want to act and couldn't deal with what he was being forced to do.<br/><br/>A very young looking Ethan Hawke is shy Todd Anderson. And a very young Josh Charles who is still acting in TV, he was Will in ""The Good Wife.""<br/><br/>Fine movie with no easy answers but we are each encouraged to seize the day in our own lives. Sadly Robin Williams took his own life in 2014 at age 63."

","There is a lot to like about the movie. Cinematography, characterizations, actors, etc. I really liked how it leaves you feeling for Keating's character at the end, while also in many ways arguing against his actions. The Latin teacher and principal are respectful and cordial. Their positions are more level headed. After all, Keating's student kills himself, when he could have waited a year and become an actor. He would have been an ""adult"" in no time. He couldn't wait. I have to be an actor now or die. I can understand feeling that way if your parents are telling you you can't be who you want to be. But suicide? The other students are reckless too. They're young. They're not as capable of thinking long term. They're doing stuff that's risking expulsion... stupid stuff, that could negatively impact the rest of their lives. They don't have as much experience. Anyway, that's why i liked the movie. Did really well developing that central question of how much freedom and responsibility 17 years can handle. How much critical reasoning can they do and should it be encouraged? Hard to say, I think."

","It's autumn in 1959.Todd Anderson is a shy young man who starts his senior year of high school at Welton Academy, an all-male, elite prep school. His roommate is an outgoing Neil Perry, who wants to be an actor but whose dream is objected by his father. The school has a new English teacher, John Keating. His unorthodox teaching methods inspire most of the students to carpe diem- seize the day. Dead Poets Society (1989) is a drama classic directed by the Australian master Peter Weir. Tom Schulman is behind the great script. The actors are all extraordinary. Robin Williams gives a memorable performance as Keating. This actor, who was mostly known as a comedian, proves here he could master drama as well. It is sad we haven't had Robin on this Earth for three years since he took his own life. Robert Sean Leonard is terrific as Neil. His character kills himself in this movie and we all cry with his fellow students. Kurtwood Smith is very good as his strict father. Ethan Hawke is great as the shy Todd, who finds courage in him he thought he didn't have with the help of his teacher. Then we also have Norman Lloyd, who is brilliant as Headmaster Gale Nolan. This actor is 102 years old today and has kept on working in the recent years! I had seen this movie a number of years ago, and recently I found the DVD from the library. I found the story very inspirational. The way Mr. Keating teaches the boys poetry...I mean, I have written some poetry in my spare time, but maybe I should have had a teacher like Mr. Keating, who would have put more faith in me and I could maybe now consider myself a great poet. Who knows..."

","When this film was released (1989) I saw it with my boyfriend and another couple with whom we worked. My boyfriend and the female of the other couple were completely indifferent to 'Dead Poets Society' and scoffed at it whereas the other guy and I glanced at each other but didn't say a word. We'd ""felt"" something and we knew it.<br/><br/>Yes, I was only 21 but looking back I can now see that this understanding I wordlessly shared with this chap was the first time in my adult life I experienced something akin to what I believe this film does so well. Not only does it encourage young people to not be afraid to live in the moment, to feel, to care, to love because without any of these, life is merely an existence but also to pay heed to what you know in your heart is your own truthful path and it's highly likely to be very different to those of many people around you. And that this is okay.<br/><br/>I love this film. Truly. It has stayed with me ever since that first viewing and has calved out a special niche all of its own; nothing else really compares in many ways. That may sound over the top but for this film, I think it's true. I've seen lots of films since then, of course, but none of them have so easily and effectively raised empathy in me related to the pain and the very human element of hope and desperation we experience in our lives. This film does this so cleanly and with such consideration to how the characters are really feeling at each moment that it doesn't appear you are watching a film at all, more like experiencing what is happening.. And it all seems so.. familiar somehow because it is. Because we've all been teenagers ridden with angst and seemingly insurmountable insecurities inherited from our parent's unhappiness and failings. This film depicts teenagers but adults would do well to watch, learn and remember how to be open again.<br/><br/>Robin Williams was an exceptionally empathetic person and I've always had difficulty watching his ""funny"" roles when it was so excruciatingly obvious that he was in a lot of pain. Yet when I see him in this film, and you can sense all this unhappiness inside him (Ethan Hawke said the same thing apparently), I like to think that this is actually what Robin did so well. He was a teacher and by way of Peter Weir's personable direction, Robin taught us how to care, to feel and to love. That is, those of us who are able, open and willing to really go to places where real emotions are, where real life is. And in real life, as with Robin, it's not always Disney so you won't be laughing – neither because it's ""funny"" nor out of ""relief"".<br/><br/>A very lovely, beautiful and meaningful film. I hope you enjoy it too."

One day, one of the students found Keating established the poetry club called ""Dead Poets Society"" and then, some students decide to reestablish that club.<br/><br/>In this film, some poems that are related to life were quoted. In particular, Horace's ""Carpe diem"" (Seize the day) is the theme of this film so through Keating and students' words and behaviors, this film taught me how should I live my life. Some core students are in trouble in this film so they undergo mental conflicts, and like them, we also be needed to decide carefully for our lives. So, Keating and great poets lead them and us. You'll understand that poems of life tell us what is the essence of our lives if you read ""Carpe diem"" or watch this film.

It hit so close to home. It almost felt as though the movie was made for me. After it ended I just felt this unexplainable pain in my chest about Neil and the other guys. At the same time it made me feel this feeling I've never felt before. A feeling of wonder and joy and happiness of being alive and being here. A feeling that is so good it cannot be explained. Thats when I realized that I had watched that movie... that movie that made me whole. I was born 10 years after this movie was released but no matter how old it is I know for sure that I would never be able to love another movie as much as I loved this masterpiece. How could I?

","This film is about a teacher who shows his students that they can dare to follow their dreams and be great.<br/><br/>The characters were greatly developed, there is more to find out about them than what is shown to us, and that makes them more human and believable. The Dead Poets Society is not just about high school kids reading poems at night, but about young people daring for the first time to question themselves and authority figures, as well as to ""Seize the day"".<br/><br/>There were still some things I found hard to believe, like Mr Keating (Robin Williams) not really teaching poetry but making them stand up in chairs, playing soccer and walking in circles. The examples of the kids daring to do ""great"" things are not that great; Would you really go to a girls school to read her a poem in front of her boyfriend? Would you really commit suicide because your father doesn't approve your acting and wants to send you to a military academy?<br/><br/>Overall, Williams gives a great performance and the cast works great together, it is well shot and the suicide scene is very powerful and memorable.

Anywho, professor Keating, who keeps constantly quoting Whitman, Herrick, and Tennyson, introduces the boys into the ""cute"" world of poetry in a very dynamic and playful acting much as the actor himself, losing himself into his theatrical persona where he reads Shakespeare sonnets impersonating Marlon Brando from the godfather (uhmm somebody needs to tell Robin that the godfather deputed 19 years after the time of the movie) but regardless of his outstanding performance as the quick witted, fast paced professor, I'm afraid that Robin Willam's character does not fit as a protagonist of this film rather than the tool that helped the plot move, the character wasn't anything more than a very well crafted plot device in this movie.<br/><br/>The main conflict we see in this movie is between a young Robert Sean Leonard playing the role of Neil, a smart student who dreams of becoming an actor, and his hardheaded strict father who denies him his wishes in fear of it disturbing his education (probably the only white boys in the US who cannot defy their parents) a conflict which ends up in a most tragic way.<br/><br/>The dead poets society is a secret society founded by an intellectual equivalent of a 98 Pound weakling teenage version of professor John Keating himself, and reincarnated by his young students who get immediately attracted to the idea of poetry under the influence of their charismatic teacher, the reincarnated form though, seems to be completely purposeless (well asides from meeting in a cave in the night, wooing chicks with other poets lines and dancing to Vanche Lindsay's ""The Congo"" (one of the poems that critics debate it's racist content which is ironic in an all white cast movie).<br/><br/>The movie's cast including Robin Willams, Robert S. Leonard, and Ethan Hawke did a great job portraying their roles and quite frankly hiding the many flaws in a movie that has not one, not two but three scenes with birds flying off in one sequence (maybe Peter Weir is trying to compensate for the lack of ""birds"" in the all boys school?) but all in all the movie is quite enjoyable, entertaining and indeed, worthwhile."

","This film gives a new definition to the word brilliant. It's the most inspiring film I've seen in a long time. Terrific. I watched this film to honour the incredible late actor, comedian, and a patron of other noble professions, Robin Williams. Mr. Keating. Oh Captain, my Captain. To honour his legacy, and in his memory: just yesterday was the anniversary of his death. <br/><br/>All good films must come to an end, the end of this film was a tragic one. And all the while, as much as I wish to be able to write a new one, I'm reminded that the world is what we make it. So, in light of the coming film release of the BFG, and in respect for this delightfully engaging film, I give a message to parents: fuel your children's passions, let 'em dream, give them reason to live and nurture their talents. Teach 'em and give them happiness. In Thoreau's words 'suck out all the marrow in life'. Help your children seek out all every last drop of goodness, teach them to appreciate it. The alternative? Live with, or rather suffer, the consequences. <br/><br/>My own parents wouldn't exactly be open to practising this message, so I understand what it means to be hindered, to have your path chosen for you. And I recognise just how vital it is to not pressure our children to live the life we never did, that we could never have dreamt possible. I hope to have the opportunity, one day, to put my message into practice. I hope you'll join me. And if you have no desire to, then watch this film- I can only hope it will change your decision.<br/><br/>Now because I should actually be reviewing this film, I'll begin. This is the sort of film that can reveal the fractures, the breaking points, the faults of a system, of society. It introduces a new way of thinking, helps tackle blind, ignorant, conformity. Teaches us to raise our voice, to take a stand. This film has the potential to build a new kind of individual: a rebel, an intellectual, someone who earnestly seeks out the opportunity to learn, and create. Someone who makes or breaks tradition- but an individual who doesn't act alone but, with a network of friends. Together, they give rise to a revolution. <br/><br/>To quote from Walt Whitman, as Mr Keating does, 'the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.' And to ask the question Mr Keating gives his students, and one I believe we should all be asked at some point in our lives, ""what will your verse be?""<br/><br/>This film is at the very top of my favourites list!  And I can promise you will love it, dead poet's honour<br/><br/>NB: I realise this review strays from the usual written structure, but I figured all the other reviewers will be able to attest to the fact that the acting was brilliant, casting choices on-point, etc..."

","In this film, the life of a conservative school for rich young people is changed by the arrival of a poetry teacher with ideas and unorthodox methods. Directed by Peter Weir, has a screenplay by Tom Schulman and features Robin Williams in the lead role. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and is regarded as the consecration film of Williams' career.<br/><br/>For me, its one of most moving and uplifting films I saw. In a world where the task of teaching is often undervalued by parents, pupils and even by governments, this film shows how a teacher can change the thinking and life of a student, for the best or the worst. In order to teach its enough to know, but to be a good teacher you must have passion. And it is precisely this love of the act of teaching (and what is taught) that transforms and captivates students. Another powerful message that this film conveys is the importance of thinking in an original way, according to our own head, instead of thinking according to what others preach. Finally, the film draws attention to the limited time we have to be better than we are, ""seize the day, and make your lives extraordinary"".<br/><br/>The cast were up to the challenge but Robin Williams holds the whole audience with an accurately and deeply moving performance. The sets and costumes are good, managing to perfectly recreate the atmosphere of schools of rich and privileged students. Photography is regular. The soundtrack is good and makes a good accompaniment of the film."

","If I'd taken note of it at the time I'd forgotten this was a Disney Joint. Along with School Ties three years later it proved to be a masterclass in acting for an entire classroom of 18-year-olds. Interesting to view this movie in light of more recent events in Robin Williams' life. Would Mr. Keating have chosen to end his own life? What the movie makes clear is the fact that most schooling is a plot to train students for a 9-5 assembly line. Creativity and independent thought are to be discouraged or spanked out of kids though canings and paddlings as such are looked down on today. Private schools are seen as an opportunity to meet up with and make associations with the right kind of people from the right backgrounds to become the corporate movers and shakers their parents expect them to become. Any attempt to deviate from this path is strongly discouraged. The miss-guided control parents attempt to exercise over their children's lives is shown to tragic degree in this movie. My dislike of Kurtwood Smith probably stems from watching this film.<br/><br/>I was bussed 25 miles to a consolidated high school, no private residential school for me but this movie brings back memories. I may have had an average in the 90ies but I took great pleasure each June once I'd gotten my exam results in sitting in front of the old drum that fed smoke to our smokehouse and ritually burning an entire year's scribblers and classroom notes. Our books were provided so we had to turn them in at the end of term.<br/><br/>Watching a DVD provides the opportunity to see deleted scenes and other supplements. Watching the young actors 12 years later and now in their 30ies talk about the experience of making the movie makes me feel better about my own memory--they can't agree on some rather basic details.<br/><br/>What this movie drives home in spades is the fact that parents may encourage their children, empower them, give them opportunities to thrive, love them and praise them; but they should not expect to live their lives for them and certainly not fulfil their parents dreams.<br/><br/>I fell in love with Robert Sean Leonard as an actor with this movie and have followed his career ever since. His next movie had him playing Paul Newman's rather straight-laced son in Mr. and Mrs. Bridge, an entirely different role. In Safe Passage he plays a pot smoking free spirit. Leonard is proof that one can be a great actor without becoming a movie star. You've probably seen him in many roles and not even realized who was playing--to my mind that's the mark of a great actor. In this movie he definitely a leader among men."

","Sure, sometimes the movie is on the edge of kitsch but who would have thought beforehand that a movie with a teacher trying to inspire his students for poetry would turn out to be such a success. What's more, the movie has also turned the Horace aphorism ""carpe diem"" into a term that has found its way into modern language and is widely understood. One has to concede, however, that the movie does not deliver its original meaning, which is more about enjoying life as it is than shaping it to one's favour.<br/><br/>Usually I am not such a big fan of Robin Williams as I am not so fond of clowneries but in this movie, he, as Mr. Keating, was playing the unobtrusive part of his lifetime. This opinion apparently was shared by some colleagues from the show business who in their shows, on the occasion of Mr. Williams's death, climbed up a table just as Mr. Keating did in Dead Poets Society to demonstrate how the change of perspective can alter preconceptions.<br/><br/>Besides, the movie can also be seen as a didactic play on what effects a liberal or a strict education can have on teenagers. It will, hopefully open the eyes of all parents who are convinced to know best what is good for their kids without ever asking the kids what they want. The message of possible disaster, however, does not come across completely convincing since I could not quite understand why Neil felt so trapped since otherwise he was a self-confident young fellow.<br/><br/>Eventually, the movie also perfectly demonstrates how recklessly established systems react on outsiders who question this system and try to change it. In case of any occurrence that puts this system and its stakeholders at risk of lower outside acceptance, a scapegoat is quickly found and removed. By doing so the stakeholders count on the cowardice and fears of its dependents and unfortunately this calculation frequently pays off. So does it in the movie. The final scene with the students climbing up on their desks to demonstrate their solidarity with the scapegoat Mr. Keating makes a good ending but does not change the overall situation. It does demonstrate, however, that Mr. Keating's endeavors to encourage the students to become self-confident, non-conformist members of society have fallen on solid ground, especially with Neil's shy roommate Todd, the first one to stand up for the captain, Mr. Keating. Hence, not all is hopeless and changes for the better are possible  <br/><br/>All these interesting aspects along with the many and so diverse coming-of age character studies of the classmates make it a movie definitely worthwhile seeing. Especially it is quite different from most other films."

","Around me, everybody in high school was moved about this movie : we talked about it in classroom. Then, I didn't get along as i didn't go to theater to watch it. Later, I can't remember how i finally picked it but what's sure is that it inspired my love for college and give me a helpful hand when i did my « charlie ». <br/><br/>Now that i watch it as a adult, what strikes me is we all agree that Keating is a wonderful teacher but that's the problem indeed : for me, education is not about content, facts, data but about values, tools, feelings ! in other ways, education isn't standardized cloning but planting software. So in a way, Keating's teaching is the expected program and in that light, he shouldn't be so extraordinary just plain normal! But when i see what happens with my nephews or more generally in France where government tells about « re-foundation » without never putting kids at the center of the values, tools, feelings, I sadly understand that this movie has decades of inspiration left !"
"nmholland","9","0","0","24 March 2016"," A Great Film, Making Me Want To ""Carpe Diem""
","Dead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir and is the story of a group of boys that attend a boarding school called Welton Academy, in the 1950's. These boys' futures have all been planned out by their rich parents, and are basically bred to be nothing short of lawyers and doctors. Eventually, their English teacher leaves the school, and is replaced by a new teacher, named Mr. Keating, played by Robin Williams. Keating teaches them how to do something that they've never known before: how to live. He tells them to ""Carpe Diem,"" or seize the day, so that they can live their own lives, not their parents.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is considered one of Robin Williams' best movies, and I can't see why it's called this. Now, he does good in the film, yes, but it isn't his movie. Although he is casted as the main character, he's not. He's really the mentor of the film, and the main character is provided through the boys, whose variety of personalities gives every audience member someone to relate to in one way or another. I wouldn't call this movie a Robin Williams movie at all, because it's an amazing stand alone film, that just happens to feature Williams as a supporting character.<br/><br/>Now, the above paragraph shouldn't stop anyone from thinking this is a good film, because it surely is. The movie has many underlying themes, the main one being to Carpe Diem, which is a quote I've been familiar with for a long time. I've known what this means for a while now, yet this movie still affected the way I view the common phrase. I say common because one may hear this a lot, whether it be from friends, family, or by seeing it on a cheap wooden plaque that hangs on the wall. However film provides a whole new perspective (another big theme in Dead Poets Society) to the ""common"" phrase. This movie takes the saying and applies it to many things, including poetry, future goals, and just regular things that happens as a young man, told excellently through the characters.<br/><br/>This movie has many great things to offer, including the direction, most of the acting, the script, and the amazing symbolism, as described above. However, one thing I feel that most people have somewhat swept under the rug about this film is the villainous characters in the movie. Debatably the main villain is the headmaster of Welton, Mr. Nolan, played by Norman Lloyd. Now, Mr. Nolan operates the school, and all of the staff and students within it, limitlessly, without restrictions. If he wants something to happen, it happens. If he wanted a student to be expelled, they were expelled. If he wanted a teacher fired, they were fired. That's probably how Mr. Keating became a teacher there in the first place. Now, if I attended Welton, I would be walking on eggshells all the time no matter what. However, if I had a headmaster with the likes of Mr. Nolan, I would wet my pants every time I passed him in the hallway. This guy would scare the crap of me, especially if I knew that he could just expel me anytime that he felt it was a good idea. This is a big element in the movie that I feel isn't mentioned the way it should be, and I was glad to see a great villain in a great film, since that's somewhat rare nowadays.<br/><br/>The other positive I'll mention is the characters. The characters, mostly of the boys, were amazing characters. Although I didn't love all of the actors, I think the script paid amazing homage to the type of young men they were, and made them very relatable. In one way or another, I could relate to every single one of the boys in the movie, from quiet Todd (Ethan Hawke), to gregarious Charlie, nicknamed ""Nuwanda"" (Gale Hansen). The only casting choices I didn't completely approve of was that of Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet, who, I felt, could've done better as this character. For those who haven't seen it, Knox's main issue is his utter infatuation with a beautiful girl from a public school, named Chris, played by Alexandra Powers. Being a pubescent boy ""in love"" with this girl, I thought he could've done better, or have been replaced completely.<br/><br/>Now, the one big negative I have with Dead Poets Society is the, well, the Robin-Williams-isms throughout this film. Not that Williams does bad, but he seemingly has to slip in his personal qualities into the character of Mr. Keating, such as doing funny impressions of John Wayne and Marlon Brando while citing a serious quote from Shakespeare. Now, I'm no kill joy, and I understand it was written for comic relief, but there was enough funny parts slipped into Keating's interactions with the boys, that the characteristics of Robin Williams himself didn't need to be mixed into the concoction of Mr. Keating's character. This also caught the viewer a bit off guard, when a serious scene suddenly busted into the boys laughing a joke that wasn't all that funny, which took away from the realism of the movie.<br/><br/>In short, Dead Poets Society is an amazing film, with great acting, characters, a good script, and fantastic underlying themes that compels the audience to go out there and ""seize the day."""

","A fairly by-the-books tale of adolescence, uncertainty, self-discovery and clashes with authority that rises to greater things on the backs of a few dynamic performances. Central to it all is Robin Williams, of course, in a role that showed the world he could play for more than laughs, but don't overlook the dramatic chops of the kids, either. An extremely young Ethan Hawke is the focus, and he shines, but I found more versatility in Robert Sean Leonard's tragic turn as his brash, social, get- things-done roommate. A setting in the conservative 1950s excuses many of the film's indulgences, grounding it as a period piece with flashes of the cultural revolution that was already on the way, but also adds a certain sense of natural charm and classic Americana to the mix. It can be quite dark, but also very optimistic, and expertly handles that difficult range of emotion through a vast array of concurrent story lines. Very good stuff, though it often feels like it's preaching to the choir."

","This Film is one that has stayed at the top of my list since I first watched it in 2002. It contains humor, joy, sadness and irony. All of which play with the viewer's emotions. The main theme is about individuality and non-conformity. It is very easily relatable because of how dark and personal the plot gets throughout its entirety. <br/><br/>Early on in the film when Mr. Keating is introduced as the student's teacher he teaches them the meaning of ""Carpe Diem."" This is what starts to pull the boys out of their comfort zones. At the all-boys school some of the students have predetermined careers from their parents. So when they learn what it truly means to seize the day they feel the unforgettable taste of freedom. <br/><br/>Standing on the desks, ripping pages out of books and calling the teacher ""Oh Captain, my Captain"" are all activities outside of what the boys are used to. At first they are surprised by it but then they learn that they don't have to always be held down by their parents or rules. This becomes even more apparent when they revive the Dead Poets Society that Mr. Keating was involved in years before when he attended the same school. <br/><br/>With this new found freedom they all explore poetry and song which in turn interests on of the boys, Neil, in auditioning for the school's production on Midsummer Night's Dream. His father does not approve of his son pursuing a career in acting or any other similar profession. After the play, his father drives Neil home and lectures him about how Medicine is the only career Neil will have and then says he will be put into military boarding school and eventually go to Harvard. This leads Neil to commit suicide with his father's pistol.<br/><br/>Of course Neil's father doesn't blame himself but blames Mr. Keating and he is then fired from the school. This is alright though because over the time of his teaching, he taught the students to be individuals. They have paths already lain before them but they can make their own path and not conform to the rest of society. It is more important to be happy and do what you love than to just go with the flow."

In fact this picture is a poem all by itself. <br/><br/>Like Poetry, it celebrates life and love before anything else. Robin Williams, like a true poet, drives his students and by them, us through what this art represents:not just a question of rhymes and rhythm but life and pleasure. ""We will be worm food whatever happens to us so let's enjoy life till it's still time or Carpe Diem"", That's all the Dead Poet Society is all about: celebrate life.<br/><br/>It's also an ode about the beauty of education and the strong relationship between the students and the teacher. Robin Williams is the teacher who tries and thinks outside the box bringing an entire new dimension to his lectures. He's also treating his students as equal and let them bring life to the course. All the young actors playing the students are also marvelous and so powerful just like their captain Williams is.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie I so wish to see more often these days. The kind of movies which means something and shares emotions to the people watching it. The kind of movie which will stay in the memory and will never fade away.

"brchthethird","8","0","0","13 November 2014"," A marvelously inspiring story with one of Robin Williams' best performances
","DEAD POETS SOCIETY is an incredibly moving film by Peter Weir about life at a boys prep school. It stars Robin Williams as John Keating, an English teacher, with Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke as two of the core group of students. I went into this film knowing a little about the plot from various clips on the internet, e.g., the famous ""Oh captain, my captain"" line. I was also aware about the fate of a character, although I didn't know which one until watching it. I was generally very impressed with the film, and Robin Williams' performance in particular. The story is one that had the potential to be very clichéd and overly sentimental, but the themes discussed within were approached earnestly and backed up with some great performances. Robin Williams is especially great as the English teacher, whose unique worldview (at least in the stodgy prep school environment) and unconventional teaching methods inspire the boys to make the most of their lives and dare to break the mold. The film follows several of these boys who are inspired to ""seize the day"" in various ways. Robert Sean Leonard's character pursues his dream of acting and another character, Knox Overstreet, pursues a girl that he loves despite the threat of her boyfriend finding out. Together, the boys bring back a poetry reading group originally started by Keating, called the ""Dead Poets Society"" (hence, the title of the film). This wasn't actually the point of the film, but more of a jumping-off point. The wonder of the film is to see how the boys develop and change for the better under Keating's influence. I can't say enough how much I loved the message. That being said, there are a couple of areas worth talking about which aren't as great. One of them is that given the large cast of characters, more time could have been spent developing them, although what's there was adequate. There is also a climactic scene which, while still handled tastefully, felt a little emotionally manipulative. Overall, this has to be the best of Robin Williams' dramatic roles that I've seen so far. It's an engaging, thought-provoking and moving film about making the most of your life, even if the setting is a bit overused. Highly recommended."

","Dead Poets Society is considered by many to be the crowning achievement of Robin Williams career. There is no dispute over Williams performance, as it is considered to be one of the best of all time, and the film is so revivered, that it's require viewing in many education classes, but just how good a film was it? Robin Williams stars as Professor John Keating, an unconventional teacher who inspired his students to push the boundaries of the way they think. Keating's students worship him and reform the old club he was a founding member of as a student, The Dead Poets Society. Keating's unconventional thinking pushes his students, but the question is will it push some of them too far from the norm, at their strict boarding school? The performances makes this film, as you will see some amazing things. As for the story, it really isn't anything more than a means to present the characters. When you take away the performances, the truth is that this film is about a traditional boarding school, an English class, and a poetry club, not the most interesting of stories. Dead Poets Society is rather slow moving and one begins to question just how meaningful a club like this would be, especially in today's digital world. When it comes to Dead Poets Society, I loved the performances, but wasn't crazy about the film as a whole. I think the storyline is lacking, the characters aren't as unconventional as they could have been, and things move much too slowly for mainstream audiences. That being said, if you are a movie lover, this film is like It's A Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane in that it may not be the best of films, but it is a part of cinematic history that must be scene for it's undeniably outstanding performances and it's contribution to the history of film."

","The movie digs deep about the very foundational idea of conforming whether to the general idea of well being, which may not be in line with one's own choice, or to live and let live the very desires that makes one feels very much alive. The premise is inserted well in the theme of artistic literature and the philosophical paradigm it comes with. There is less twists in the steady build up and flow of the story. But the dramatization is superb. It's able to grasp most, if not all, the essential issues concerning the period of the younger adulthood. The movie is then capped by a great sequence of finale events that question the idea of loyalty, not just to the friends beside you, but also to yourself and your belief. Robin Williams acted out good here, although I have to say that this is not his best performance. It's nice to see Ethan Hawke's earlier works in this movie. And it's quite a loss that most of the other actors of this class don't really make a long career."

I really found this movie interesting mainly because students looked really similar to Korean students. We had to study hard to go to well-known univiersities and earn a lot of money. Students in Korea might feel like they are a machine following what parents say. There is no time for us to find and enjoy our interest and identity. So, I was really fascinated by students started to change, not afraid of standing agians their parents. Also, the scene quoting Walt Whiteman's 'O Me!

","The dead poet's society is such an outstanding drama that can change ones' perspective on their life. Set in high school time, there is a genius teacher that is eager to make his students' life extraordinary. Believing that everyone has their own success, he strove for bringing out the best in their students with anything he can do, such as explaining the things in a way that can make students understand the most. There are some important lessons from this drama. One of them, which most of the people took the lesson of, is Carpe Diem, which basically means seize the day. However, there's a more valuable thing that I think people are likely to overlook it, and that is to always look at something in a different way which is illustrated by the teacher standing on his desk. This is very constructive because when we only look at something in a particular way and don't try to observe in other way, we can't have full picture of that thing. It is like if we only see an elephant from front view for the whole of our life, we never know that elephant is big until we die.

","""Dead Poets Society"" is a movie about students in Welton Academy, a conservative and traditional school, finding their own thoughts and ways of seeing the world, inspired by their new teacher, John keating. They form a club named ""Dead Poets Society"", and have poetry reading, and share free thoughts about their own view to the world, and try several things they are not allowed to even think about by school in a cave. They go through lots of changes in their perspective on their lives, but somehow, cruel reality of real society turns them down. However in the end they learn valuable lessons that they might never forget through their lives by ""Standing Up"" on their own feet. Through the movie, John Keating is always there to help the boys, and to instruct them to get to the real truth of life, ""Carpe diem.""<br/><br/>Even though this movie is set in 1950s, I could easily empathize with the characters. Several settings in the movie such as their rigid instructor like Dr.Hager, suffocating father, Mr. Perry, or ""Orthodox education method"" that Dr.Hager insists, and mandatory school uniforms which kill the characteristics of each member of the students reminded me so much of my school life which was from 2005 to 2007. Because in Korea, still, fever of education for their kids among parents are irrationally rampant, I actually was kind of like the students in the movie who were forced by adults to ""obey"" the rules, never being allowed to ""think"" by themselves. Watching the movie, I felt the exact catharsis that those enthusiastic and ambitious boys felt with John's ""unorthodox"" way of teaching. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was so good that Iwould say it is one of my top best 10 movies from 20th century. The plot was very believable, and convincing, and the performances of the young actors were outstanding. I cried when they cried, and I shouted ""Oh, captain, my captain!"" when they shouted out loud ""Oh, captain, my captain!"" At the end, poignant scenes involving tears of sincere and poor boys left in the cruel society made me think a lot about ""whose fault can we say it is on the tragedies."" Could we blame the period of the time, 1950s, or generation, or just adults? I think it's ""blindness"" whether it is deliberate, or naturally passed that we have to think about. I think this question made it such a good movie. And because of so many parents in Korea these days still blindly pursuing only good results of school grades of their children, I think a movie like this should be seen more to be aware of what value we should put our priorities on – especially when it's about our society's future inner circle-to-be. Every year, I fear to use internet on the second week or the third week of November because it's when news about suicides of devastated Korean students who failed to succeed on College Scholastic Ability Test comes up on major portal sites. Whoever did not see this movie, especially if you are Korean, I highly recommend that you watch this movie."

","""Dead Poets Society"" staring Robin Williams is quite well-known for the public and was awarded Academy Awards. After the end credits rolled, the movie proved that it deserved the awards. The story is about our society to force people to be repressed without sentimental feelings. The students in the movie seemed to reflect our uniformed world. They want to be someone with emotion and sentiment. But, the reality does not flow into the way that they want. Even though the plot could easily have become terribly common, Robin Williams and other characters had the skill to make it gripping. The masterful acting kept my attention from beginning to end. Especially, the scene that students come together and listen to the poet, ""O'me, O'life"" by Walt Whitman, made me shiver. And the words ""Carpe Diem"" which means 'seize the day', remained in my brain after the movie. I'm wondering if I live like that. So, I really hope that such a movie will be released again in theaters."

","For those that have a similar schooling experience of that showed in Dead poet society movie, it became a turning point and a warm memory. But, conservative schools and life styles are everywhere. This film brought through poems and sentences of great American poets and thinkers inspiring ideas to deal with crucial things that make us humans: passion and freedom. These two very human features are still difficult to deal in the daily life of our societies crossing lines of ideologies, religions and cultures. Robin Willians played his character of a literature professor in a very emotional way transporting us to the conservative environment in which American libertarians had to manage in order to produce their books. Because of that, Dead poets society is a classical movie."

","Having a strong role model is instrumental in the development in our lives. Whether it's an athletic coach, parent or an English teacher, we are all touched uniquely by those around us. <br/><br/>We are all arguably trying to attain happiness in our lives. This can range from searching for love and exploring the world to volunteering at the local animal shelter. Regardless of ""what"" we strive to do, it is important to realize we are genuinely interested in fulfilling this void. <br/><br/>Poetry is more than just another form of expression. Language is arguably the strongest tool we as humans have, and is a special talent that can be used to accomplish extraordinary feats. Throughout the education system, students (and even teachers) often begin to forget the purpose and importance of the content being learned.<br/><br/>Enter Mr. Keating.<br/><br/>He is no simple man nor is he carrying a stringent course outline. He allows his students freedom; the chance to realize and fulfil their potential, whatever that means. He encourages his students to explore, understand and seriously think about society and the world we live in. He is an example of what every child deserves...what they need. It is sad to see people live like drones despite the immense opportunities the work has to offer. It is crucial that we learn to seize the day and actually make the most of our lives!<br/><br/>Living your life according to your will and yours alone is a testament that should be widely advocated. Not one where people are necessarily individualistic, no, but one where everyones learns to enjoy every moment of their lives. Why spend your life doing something you don't enjoy? Be passionate and live, since the worst death is one while you're still alive."
"LSTHNSTMAN","10","0","0","8 January 2014"," Dr. Laura Schlesenger was motivated to write a book because of this film
","Yes, imagine that! A former well known radio hostess, wrote a self help book because she was so impressed/disturbed by the action or should I say lack of action by a minor (perhaps as the story plays out) major player in the story. Please note; Dr. Laura's book does not critique the film per se, but nonetheless as the author herself states it was the motivating factor and driving force for her authorship of the aforementioned tome. Now to my observations of the film itself. I truly enjoyed the film, I also note that the character of Mr. Keating is that of an idealist as well as that of a cock-eyed optimist in an overly realist and conservative academic setting. He wants the boys to grow up as men and not as robots programmed by their wealthy parents as well as the aura and tradition of the school during this chronological time. Of course he is betrayed by some of his students (in particular Cameron a weasel and rat if ever there was one) as well as the School Administration and parents of the DPS club members. The School wants a ""scapegoat"" to survive ( ah the power of $$$$$$$ again) the parents wants a ""scapegoat"" (to hide the type of ""people"" they truly are even though they would denounce publicly such ""people"") The villain in the movie is Neil Perry's dad who is trying to live his life vicariously through both his son's lives. He sounds more Jewish than Waspy in the ""my son the Dr. attitude"". Truth be told I cannot watch anything portrayed by the actor who plays the father as it has poisoned my feelings based on watching this movie. While it may be wrong I am a victim of my feelings in this case. Neil Perry's mom is also to blame as she knows her son's POV is correct, but she is loathe to confront her husband tyrant dare I call him a Jack Boot Gestapo type ""I am the law"" father. Well they both paid as did Neil the ultimate price for their actions. The mother sits there even shares her bed with the ""old man"" and never attempts to stop the emotional bleeding of her son. Boy do I know how that feels. I had a mom just like that and her lack of direct action vs. my ""father"" has forever scarred my life Dr. Laura you hit this point right on the head. Of course after he sees his dead son on the floor he laments, ""my poor son, my poor son."" Hey you dumb SOB you are the cause of your son's actions but of course the old man would never admit to that. Boy does that attitude mirror my dad the fool. The other disturbing scene is when the headmaster attempts to gain knowledge about the DPS with the corporal punishment of one its members. The Headmaster is an old ""dog"" of a man who sadistically relishes the abusive punishment he is inflicting on the youngster, and as he can not ""break him"" he (the Headmaster) is so frustrated and infuriated that he beats him similar to Captain Blye with greater gusto and zeal. I know this is 1959 but it would have been great to see the student (Mr. Dalton) turn around to the ""old fart"" and kick the living daylights out of him saying"" no one assaults me you old fool"" I think a remake of the film fast forwarding 50 years with Todd reminiscing about his time at Welton would be well received. Finally, rent/buy or somehow get your mits on the flick, especially if you are an educator!!!!! Finally, the student (Mr. Hopkins) who perhaps is the most cynical member of the class pays tribute to Keating in the last scene by joining his classmates and stands on his desk too. A cynic with guts, my kind of Mensch!!!!"

","Being a student was always a tough period for me. Lots of expectations, and lots of commitments, and I never really asked myself what will become of me in the next 10 or 20 years. There weren't much of a mentor for me except a few movies like 'Dead Poet's Society'. consider the scene from the movie, in which the satisfaction provided by a poem is plotted as a mathematical expression. Ironically, our lives are somewhat similar. There are teachers who will give us the knowledge about the stuff explained on the text books, but a few will dare to show us the real lessons of life. Thus, dead poets society acts as a mirror to our consumerist society. The liberation should be started from schools, and they should provide sane citizens instead of ATM machines. I always believe in movies which provides some social conscience. Even if the movie is about the relationship between a few students and their beloved teacher, we can see ourselves in them. Souls which are trying to break out from chains. Robin William's Keating, Robert Leonard's Neil, and Ethan Hawke's Todd will remain with us even after we left the movie. That is the real victory of a movie. No wonder 'Carpe Diem' is considered as one of the greatest movie quotes..."

"thedozinglion","10","0","0","7 September 2013"," Walk to the Beat of your Own Drum
","""Carpe Diem"" is the line often quoted from the 1989 film Dead Poets Society to signify making the most out of life today. However for me the real theme of the movie is better encapsulated in the quotes by Thoreau and Frost on ""walking to the beat of your own drum"" and ""following the path less travelled"". A rebellion away from conformity towards individuality.<br/><br/>Robin Williams is cast in the role of John Keating, the idealistic new teacher at Welton Academy a conservative prep school during the late 1950s. The school is a milder version of the Bunker Hill Military Academy of TAPS (1981), exacting control through ""tradition, honour, discipline and excellence"". In essence an expensive factory designed to process boys into men of standing and position at the expense of their uniqueness. <br/><br/>Keating's teaching methods allow his students to struggle against not only the school and its lifeless dogma but also family and society's convention. Unlike Kevin Kline's William Hundert in The Emperor's Club (2002), Keating is not interested in shaping the character of the boys he teaches but unlocking their potential. Early in the movie he instructs his class to rip out the antiquated Introduction to Poetry in their textbooks which looks to take the soul out of the verse and replace it with a formula for understanding. This is much like the ethos of the school itself which seeks to remove the identity of the boys to supplant it with a tried and tested docility.<br/><br/>The two main leads are played well by the then rising stars Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard. Their forming of the Dead Poets Society being the central form of rebellion in the film, a midnight meeting group off campus, breaking school regulations while allowing the boys to read the great freethinking poets of the past and their own adolescent compositions to one another.<br/><br/>However the true rebel in the movie is not a student but Robin William's quixotic Keating, a free-spirited thinker who challenges the autocratic system in place and give the power of thought to his students. He is the polar opposite of Michael Redgrave's Crocker-Harris in The Browning Version (1951), a man whose passion for teaching has been eroded by years of apathy from his students leading to a teacher of rote rather than reason.<br/><br/>Keating forms the midpoint in a trilogy of non-conformist characters played by Williams over a three year period starting with army disc jockey Adrian Cronauer in Good Morning Vietnam (1987) to Dr. Malcolm Sayer in Awakenings (1990). All three fight their prevailing systems (military, academia and medicine) to aid those within it. Williams is well able to embody the radical troublemaker effectively although his schizophrenic personality is toned down in each subsequent film. He is at his best as an actor when he is not playing for laughs but using comedy to flesh out his characters and tell a story.<br/><br/>In a memorable scene Keating takes Thoreau's quote from Walden and has the boys acts it out:<br/><br/>""If a man loses pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured, or far away.""<br/><br/>Having the self-conscious boys walk around the school courtyard in their own style forces them to have awareness of their individuality much to the disapproval of the watching headmaster. Keating in the scene also quotes Robert Frosts poem The Road Not Taken:<br/><br/>""Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""<br/><br/>These quotes perfectly represent the concept of not accepting the majority voice as the absolute truth but instead putting yourself and your beliefs at the center. For what good is life if it is half lived without creativity and freedom of choice and action. <br/><br/>However the power of freethinking that Keating gives to his student ends in tragedy. To fight against the system and society can be difficult for those unaccustomed to it. Keating is held responsible by the school for the loss due to the fear of the parents and staff of his methods, which have unleashed the raw potential in his students.<br/><br/>Alas, there is no Scent of a Women (1992) defiance by the students when the headmaster looks for informers against Keating, all the boys of the Dead Poet Society sign, in effect, his expulsion papers. But the final scene does give hope that these young men will grow up with more than just honour and loyalty that the school demands. They will also have a heart and mind open to their own ideas and beliefs, they will never tamely believe or do what is told them but will seek out the truth as they find it."

Through the few scenes located in Mr. Keatings English classroom, the boys become free thinkers and poets, for example, the first scene distinguishes Mr. Keating to be called ""Oh Captain My Captain"". In a similar setting, Keating encourages the boys to stand up on the desk so they may look at the world in another way.The final scene in which the boys show their support for their English teacher Mr. Keating by standing up on their desks saying ""Oh Captain My Captain"", closes up the film excellently. This movie changed my life and I hope you're moved by it as much as I was."

","This film is set in 1959. A new English teacher at an elite prep school inspires his students to ""Seize the day"". This involves very unusual teaching methods (some of which appear to be frowned upon by his peers), although he appears to improve the lives of his students with these methods. He is able to make his students love poetry, even reviving an old club from Keating's days at Welton so they can discuss poetry and ""Woo Women"". However, the film also shows that the students take ""Seizing the day"" a bit too far, being unaware as to knowing ""the time for action and the time for caution"".<br/><br/>The most powerful scene in this film is probably Neil's death. The use of sound throughout is extraordinary, the reactions to his death are also very emotional, and the idea that Neil has no control over his short-long term future due to his very strict father makes this outcome very believable and more upsetting.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people can relate to many of the teenage characters. I find I can relate to Todd because I also have very low confidence, and have many of the problems involved with him in the film i.e. talking in front of groups of people. Charlie/Nuwanda (the struggle to get the girl), Neil (strict parents/wanting to do what you want but feeling trapped).<br/><br/>I give this film top marks because it truly is one of the best films ever made. It is very inspiring, and I truly do believe that since I watched it for the first time, I have gained confidence in real life.<br/><br/>One of Robin Williams' best films. I also recommend Good Will Hunting if you enjoyed this movie."

","Dead Poets Society is a dramatic and realistic film. The story takes place in 1959 at Welton School, a prep school for boys. School is not only a social institution for students to study, but also an epitome of society. Peter Weir, the director, shows the contradictions in human nature and society in many of his films. He got great success with this film, since it grossed $235,900,000 in 1989 with an estimated budget of $16,400,000.<br/><br/>Robert Sean Leonard acts as a special English teacher named Mr. Keating who has an amazing sense of humor. Robin Williams, who earned himself an Oscar nomination, plays Neil Perry as a young student whose passion for acting is smothered in fear of his father's wrath and his parents' domination of his life. The English teacher tries creative ways to let the students notice their own voices. For Neil, whose life plan that is controlled by his parents, this is a problem. As I know, being a Chinese student myself, Neil is a typical delegate of a group who are dutiful to their parents' wishes and study hard for them. Through this story, the viewers may empathize with Neil and the hope of change that comes from the English teacher.<br/><br/>Mr. Keating, a former student at the school, begins working in this school as an English teacher. His unique teaching methods inspire students to find themselves, love the poems, and ""seize the day,"" as he says to his students in their first class, standing in front of a picture of the former students who had passed on. He reminds students to look at things in different ways. The movie climax is when Neil chooses to go against his father's wishes and perform in the school play. Things change before the day of the play's performance when Neil's father discovers his son is acting. He is disappointed and angry with Neil, and will not let his son go.<br/><br/>Most of the main characters in the movie are dynamic, meaning they change from the beginning to the end. Neil turns from being a rule-follower to an independent-thinker, which shows in the end of the story in a special way. Todd, a shy student, becomes more confident. Mr. Keating loves teaching them, but is discouraged at Datton.<br/><br/>The theme or message of this movie is to seize the day. Watching this story, you are happy for the students for being themselves, but you are also sad that because they are following their heart, they are punished also.<br/><br/>After watching this dramatic and realistic film, I feel totally different at the end of the film and have a question for myself and others: should we follow our hearts, or do what our parents expect us to do? Sometimes what society wants from us is different than what we want for ourselves. Maybe you will fear being ""different"" from others, but being different is not always wrong. You may lose something by being independent, but you will also gain some other things. If you follow your strong beliefs and make good, responsible decisions, you can be the best at what you choose.<br/><br/>To be or not to be, that is a choice for us. You should promote yourself, not destroy yourself. You need to show your feelings and who you are to let people understand you.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is a rare movie showing choices for education and for life. You can seize the day or just do what other people want you to do. It's a memorable movie with creative ideas and a dramatic plot. The movie will not only bathe you with happiness, but also make you think about yourself and your life. Life, for all of us, starts as a blank canvas; what we paint on that is our choice."

His new way of teaching and interaction with the students raise the students' attention to his character. They find out that their innovative teacher used to belong to a group called ""dead poets society"", hence the name of the movie. Couple of the students decide to recreate that group . The movie presents that how the life of these students is affected by this new group. They feel alive and they start doing things that they couldn't imagine doing before.

","The arts and the sciences are so alienated and estranged from each other in their basic views towards life itself that William Blake remarked ""Art is the tree of life and science is the tree of death"" – a statement that was not only prophetic but also so radical and shocking that hardly anyone considered it worth mentioning because science was beginning to take charge of all knowledge that was 'irrefutable' and 'proven'. Art was slowly and surely being relegated to the 'entertainment', or at best 'leisure' category – something to amuse ourselves with, when we were through working hard everyday in unlocking the 'mysteries of the universe' revealed by science. The authority that science enjoys is so high today, that before it, art is made to look almost like an illegitimate activity when it is not confined to entertainment alone. This process continues till this day, and in schools, colleges and universities all over the world the entire emphasis has been placed upon science, technology and commerce. Arts like poetry are as good as dead.<br/><br/>In this movie, all the students in the expensive college have been sent by their parents so as to prepare them for a lucrative career for themselves as scientists, engineers, doctors or lawyers. There is thus the intense social pressure on them to do well in their science courses, and to ignore or minimize any time spent or activities related to art or humanities. When Keating is appointed as the new poetry teacher, he finds that he has to use every bit of his talent to generate a genuine interest in his pupils for poetry – which is in his eyes the ultimate human passion and for which life is really worth living.<br/><br/>Using unorthodox techniques and settings, Keating manages to generate a spark of passion for poetry in some of his students, who upon being provided the cue by Keating, form a secret Dead Poets Society to pursue their new found interest. Since the very nature of genuine art and poetry is to challenge orthodoxy and conformity, the new found enthusiasm by the students, not tempered with maturity, leads to childish pranks that will lead to trouble with the authorities. The real tragedy occurs when one of the brightest students discovers that his interest and passion lies in the arts – in drama and acting and wants to pursue it, but finds total resistance from his father who wants him to become a doctor, and will not tolerate any disobedience from his son. This is a kind of tragedy that occurs on a colossal scale all over the world everyday when parents force their children to study those areas for which they clearly have no interest and talent. Just the blind rat-race to make lucrative careers for their children, the parents will impose their will even if it ruins the life of the child.<br/><br/>The sad but powerful message that is conveyed by the film is that the commerce based system of education throughout the world has killed 'humanity' in its blind pursuit of 'science' and thereby made the 'dead poet' Blake's prophecy come true. The full force of this truth is yet to be witnessed by 'humans', although the scientifically learned will deny this truth even at the moment of death and destruction."

","Dead Poets Society is a brilliant movie with a well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a powerful and inspirational film with very sweet, true messages that apply to the lives of everyone, to seize the day, make your life extraordinary and to follow your dreams. The complexities and challenges facing this are also chronicled here, as there will always be people holding you back from being who you want to be. <br/><br/>The only issue I really had with this movie was that there were far too many young adults to follow that none of them, other than Neil, are properly developed. We do not get a huge amount of scope for the rest of them, I certainly would liked to have seen more development there. <br/><br/>Robin Williams is, of course, the movies highlight, he plays the inspirational teacher John Keating, easily one of the greatest characters ever written for a film. Willliams gets the opportunity to deliver all levels of performance, he has dramatic scenes, comedic ones, he gets to do impressions. He showcases all of his talents with Keating while still delivering a pure, honest performance, as well as terrific chemistry between himself and the younger cast members. <br/><br/>The message of the film is strong, evident and inspirational, it does not sugarcoat the challenges of concurring your dreams and it shows how happy it can truly make you. Heartwarming, dramatic and very powerful, I would highly recommend Dead Poets Society to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>At an exclusive prep school, the arrival of an unconventional English teacher changes the lives of a group of young students with his wise and positive outlook on life. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Robin Williams"

","Let me put it this way: if you haven't seen Dead Poets Society already, then you owe it to yourself to do so. Yesyes, despite everyone saying that 'you simply must see it!'. Think about it like this: if you do, then the worst that can happen it that you don't like it. If you don't, then you risk missing out on one of the best films ever created and (more importantly) not getting that life-changing revelation. Which revelation? Watch and find out...<br/><br/>A review (for those who want to know what they're getting):<br/><br/>Directed by Peter Weir, who manages to take every tool a filmmaker has to his disposal, and uses them to create a monumental masterpiece. <br/><br/>The acting defies the term 'superb'. Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard are truly great, although I would name many more if I could. They so convince you of what they're feeling, that you truly care about them.<br/><br/>The cinematography is endlessly excellent, I could write a long essay on it. This is one of those films where you can sense the contribution made by everybody behind the camera. The lighting, sound recording, set design, everything! is magnificent.<br/><br/>The story is flawless. It tells a brilliant story brilliantly, and then also defines what it means for a story to inspire people. You cannot walk away from the film without being a different person than the one earlier.<br/><br/>Again: watch it if you haven't. Those who have already don't need to be told to watch it again. They simply will. And you will too...."

","I just finished with the movie and I personally think it was great. The characters were deep, especially Mr. Keating and Neal who I felt were quite similar to each other. They both try and rebel against people who oppose them and both fail in some way though Keating is still admired by most of the student's in his class. Neal shoots himself because of his father's continuous oppression, which I feel was not forced in the screenplay but rather beautifully planned. I felt it was quite predictable that he was going to kill himself and did not take the film out of focus but only brought more depth to it. Todd is shown to be meek and introvert for reasons unknown to the viewer but it is quite believable. I thought the film was very realistic and actually showed how students are sometimes forced to study subjects that they are not very interested in, and that parents like Neal's father and teachers like the principal of the school do exist. I can personally connect to the film as I too am a student of literature but I feel that many of the unhappy viewers are those who have no particular interest in literature and poetry. I think its a must watch and a beautifully directed film where the viewer WILL be affected emotionally in a good way and will definitely learn something from this film no matter what age group he/she belongs to."

","Remember how I said that there are always films that will change your perceptions, get under your skin, and never come out? I've marked Precious as one such film. I've found yet another that has fallen in the same category - Dead Poets Society.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society explores going against the status quo and not being afraid of embracing the arts. Todd (Ethan Hawke), an extremely shy boy, has been sent to a school where he makes friends with Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), an intelligent and popular boy. Neil, who has a flair for acting, is under his father's overbearing rule. With the help of their English teacher, Mr Keating (Robin Williams), and a handful of their schoolmates, Todd and Neil learn that being different isn't all that bad. <br/><br/>This movie is ideally juxtaposed to conformism, and that's what I absolutely love about it. Right now, everyone wants to earn O level grades, get into a good JC, end up in a good university, get a good job, start a good life, and be good until they day we die. We are so caught up in being 'good' and comfortable, that being different irks us. <br/><br/>This movie emphasises the great pleasure of life, and that we have a basic moral obligation to making the best of it. Ultimately, the world is our oyster. The only thing standing in our way to greatness is us. We set our standards, our limitations, our capabilities. This is why we have to break out of our comfort zones in order to ""seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary"". Rising up against the norm is what we have to do; to treasure what makes us happy, and to get rid of what doesn't. <br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is a true gem, an exhilarating masterpiece, a movie that has made me want to live, laugh and love more. A truly beautiful movie, 10/10. <br/><br/>Carpe diem. Seize the day, dear readers, make your lives extraordinary."

"Wuchakk","10","0","0","23 May 2011"," Seize the day; be Exceptional!
","Released in 1989, Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"" is one of the most inspiring films ever made. It ranks with my all-time favorite movies.<br/><br/>THE STORY: John Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences -- both good and bad.<br/><br/>THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND LOCATIONS are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.<br/><br/>WHAT WORKS: For the most part, the film never takes a wrong turn. It captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter.<br/><br/>This is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Although Roger Ebert criticized this scene as ""so moving he wanted to throw up,"" he's dead wrong. The scene is both unexpected and potent. That such a great writer & critic as Ebert would criticize this scene (and the movie itself) tells me he watches WAY too many movies. He gave that Roadrunner cartoon ""King Kong '05"" a perfect rating though (rolling my eyes).<br/><br/>The film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: ""the letter kills"" (referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school); the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration and spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd by his angry father (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian abuse); and so much more.<br/><br/>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well but that's always the case, even with the best of films.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS:<br/><br/>First, there's the objection that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to ""seize the day."" I disagree. The kid really started to ""seize the day"" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, both good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to ""seize the day."" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. These VARYING results make the story realistic.<br/><br/>Another criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were ""homo erotic."" This interpretation could only be derived by an ADULT in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules at a prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with a group of guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. I assure you that not one of us had a gay thought. In the film, in two the cave meetings one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school while the others look on in awe; on a couple of other occasions a couple of the guys bring porn pages of WOMEN. I think that pretty much quells the ""homo-erotic"" theory.<br/><br/>Most of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look -- but BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action', gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you ""sieze the day""? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.<br/><br/>FINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like ""Witness"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but ""Dead Poets Society"" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you already have. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.<br/><br/>The film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).<br/><br/>GRADE: A+"

","In the heart of more prolific days, Peter Weir directed this bold anti-establishment gem, starring a conspicuously reined-back Robin Williams as the unorthodox English teacher John Keating - a name that sounds like a poet's, to match the man's passion for the passion of individual will. Williams would do more nuanced, angrier work in Good Will Hunting eight years later, but this was the movie that showed the world he was more than Mork.<br/><br/>The real star of the show is Robert Sean Leonard as the tragic trickster Puck (AKA Neil Perry), whose father can't afford for him to fail, but who cannot live without his thespian dream. With a luminescence reminiscent of Jim Carrey (who would take the titular lead in possibly Weir's finest, The Truman Show), Leonard beautifully portrays the joy and agony of personal expression's vital extremes.<br/><br/>As usual, Weir's aesthetic is classic yet distinct, never bellowing for attention but occasionally coming alive to provide an indelible image: a bicycle sending a wave of birds into the sky; a shy student spinning in a poetic trance; a tiny lost figure stumbling onto a frozen harbour.<br/><br/>Maurice Jarre's ugly synth score is slightly jarring (no pun intended), but Weir is on hand to furnish his soundtrack with a series of well-chosen classical pieces, most memorably two Beethoven excerpts, including the possibly divine ""Emperor"" second movement, which helped burn Picnic at Hanging Rock into our brains.<br/><br/>There's little subtlety in this Society, but there is a wealth of humanity and truth, and a boundless idealism, amounting to another fine fable in the canon of a modest auteur."

","Robin Williams demonstrates his versatility in this movie. He combines his talents as a comic -- the students appear to laugh spontaneously as he improvises and impersonates -- with a capacity to express seriousness, hurt, and even humility. He not only seems to understand very well his character, an inspirational and empathetic teacher with a counterculture approach in a school where the rest of the staff values discipline and tradition, but also to have a feel for classroom education. <br/><br/>The young actors who play the parts of students complement Williams well. Williams does a convincing job as the unique educator who mentors as well as he teaches in part because his students come across very believably, whether taking risks with girls, trying to overcome shyness, masking fear with stubbornness, or struggling with a parent's disapproval.<br/><br/>Only the situation involving Neil Perry's suicide, because of the script and not the performances, strikes me as unlikely, reminding me that I am watching fiction. Yes, teenagers have occasionally resorted to killing themselves when they feel rejected, unloved, or unsupported by the people most important to them, but Neil Perry's reaction to his father's rigidity still seems too extreme, just as his father's attitude seems too inflexible.<br/><br/>I think I could have remained absorbed in the movie until the very end if Mr. Perry had responded to his son's successful theater debut with a tone of condescension and words such as, ""Now... you have had some fun as a dramateur, and that's all well and good, but your mother and I believe that it is time for you to become serious and practical about your future, as you and I have discussed."" Then Neil could have possibly reacted with resignation and some tears, or maybe could have avoided the trip home with his parents by hitching a ride and escaping into the city. He didn't have to shoot himself in the head. That act diminished rather than enhanced the believability of this story."

","Peter Weir took time off from an otherwise noteworthy career to direct this crowd-pleasing melodrama about yet another maverick schoolteacher with unorthodox methods, who in this instance bucks the traditions of his stuffy New England prep school by quoting Walt Whitman and inspiring his students to ""seize the day"". It's ironic that a script defending freethinking nonconformity should be so predictable, but under Weir's typically intelligent direction the film is (likewise predictably) never less than enjoyable. He pulls all the right strings in the right order, patching the familiar story together with a surplus of lush pictorial glue. Robin Williams downplays his trademark mugging style to actually offer a credible performance, despite being miscast (or at least misrepresented) in the pivotal lead role. Despite a few gratuitous moments of token stand-up comedy shtick (John Wayne and Marlon Brando impersonations, and so forth) it isn't, after all, meant to be a comedy."

It's a testament to the film's strength how overused that phrase is  it may not have been originated from the film, but it certainly popularised it.<br/><br/>The film is set in a 1950s boarding school for boys. Despite how distant and tedious that sounds, Weir quickly introduces us to the main characters and we realise that these teenage boys are not all that different from us. They have the same tendencies, the same overbearing parents, and the same problems with members of the opposite sex. They are real people. It's that emotional bond that Weir establishes so early and establishes so well that makes the rest of the movie so effective. You really feel like ""one of the guys""  you laugh when they do, you cry when they do, and you feel the zest, the zeal, the exhilarance that comes so naturally with being young.<br/><br/>Soon we meet John Keating, the new English teacher. The way I see it, the poetry that he teaches is simply a medium to get his message across. What he really teaches is a life lesson beyond even the scope of poetry: independent thinking and personal liberty. Robin Williams is truly inspirational in his role here, and well-deserved of that Oscar. I think we've all wanted a teacher like Keating in school and I believe this character has touched the souls of many an audience and has turned their lives around, urging them to be better people. We all got the message. The fact that Williams' performance can reach through the screen like that is so rare and incredible. In fact, all of the Dead Poets Society's acting is pretty strong, and this helps us feel what they feel: anguish, indignation, love.<br/><br/>The film weaves through one issue after another, utilising each experience to teach us a lesson, yet we never feel patronised. It reaches the climax but never stoops so low as to conform to a cliché. Towards the end it even asks you the question on who do you side with. I don't want to spoil anything here, but the last scene is nothing short of extraordinary. I actually had tears welling up in my eyes. I can't guarantee the same for you, but in my opinion, this is one of the most powerful and moving endings ever. Ethan Hawke (who was frankly underused in the rest of the film) finally makes a stand for himself and proves that I had not overestimated his talent.<br/><br/>Regardless of what generation you're from, this film will inspire you to ""seize the day"". There, I said it."

","""O me, o life Of the questions of these recurring, Of the endless trains of the faithless, Of cities filled with the foolish. What good amid these, o me, o life? <br/><br/>Answer: That you are here. That life exists, and identity. That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse!<br/><br/><ul><li>Walt Whitman</li></ul><br/><br/>It is only an apt tribute to talk about Dead Poet's Society with the quote by Walt Whitman, narrated by Professor Keating. ""That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse"" - certainly one of the most powerful statements I have heard, but in its simplicity, it forces you to reconsider your role in the grand scheme of things. <br/><br/>The plot is simple  a teacher who wants to make a difference in the lives of young students, who amidst pursuit of wealth and riches, as taught by their parents have forgotten the meaning of life. These young students have been persuaded to tread along the very same path of success as their predecessors, unmitigated by distractions, affections or devotion towards activities or objects other than professional success itself. And amidst this strict environment with severe restrictions, the teacher uses poetic murals to re-kindle lost passions for ideas simpler than growth and prosperity. 'Carpé Diem' is the theme of the story  'seize the day' such that you can shape yourself into the men they truly wish to be. With the beauty of expressions weaved in a delicate fabric of verse; he stirs up extinguished fires in young hearts and minds.<br/><br/>The theme sounds tremendously clichéd, but it also appropriately depicts the pace of the modern world. Investment bankers, lawyers, businessmen  no doubt successful, rich and living pompous lives in posh mansions  never stop once to think about their own dreams and deepest desires  those that defined them in their youth and formative years, those that gave them a will to stand up in the harshest of times, dreams - more like lessons - teaching them that sorrow is too futile an emotion to waste tears on. Today, desires have become synonymous with one word  money. Resigned to utter dormancy by culpable craving for professional success and money, true passion today is as obscure as memories of an amnesiac.<br/><br/>Professor Keating makes a powerful entrance by advising his students to feel poetry without its mathematical measurements and graphical introduction in books. His dislike for such misrepresentation of the art that is poetry compels him to have such insertions ripped out of every text. An alumnus himself, he was a part of a secret society that gathered every night to read poetry, or as he points out, 'bleed through their skins and lips' in true appreciation and understanding of poetic rhythms. Stimulated by this, his students form a society to follow their predecessors, in the process of which they discover themselves, their enthusiasm and desires. However the ardent enthusiasm turns into fanatical zeal and drives one of the students to suicide. Irate at the potential defamation of the school, the authorities pin the incident on Keating, by threatening his unwilling students to accept such an accusation. Being a forgiving man with a big heart, Keating understands the plight of his students, and to protect their futures, accepts his fate without the slightest resistance. As he leaves the room for the last time, a student who would shiver to speak up, in a show of respect and admiration, calls out to Keating one final time. 'O Captain, My Captain!' - from a painfully shy student who was given the courage to overcome his fear by Keating, through poetry, through the beauty of expression in words.<br/><br/>The movie deserves a high rating for the simplicity in a plot that delivers a strong message. I would rate it 8/10."

","""Dead Poets Society"" is the masterpiece of Peter Weir also ""The Truman Show"". I think that's the best film of 1989, over another masterpiece ""Driving Miss Daisy"", but i prefer this. It had a lot of sensitive moments and it makes you think. Robin Williams gives his best performance, doing the role of a poetry teacher (John Keating), that shows poetry with a fabulous point of view. Also the film has the first performance of Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and more people. The Screenplay is absolutely wonderful and the soundtrack relaxing and beautiful. The recreation of the college is so credible. Peter Weir one of the best directors of the moment, in my own opinion. He makes good films, originals, amazing... The sensitive in this film has a very important role, it makes you cry, because is a magical story about a group of friends and the relations with another the people, the poetry, the love...

","My God, this film is just so wonderful! Let's look at the physical aspects, beautifully set and filmed to begin. Privileged boys in a privileged setting but rich boys can be unhappy too as is demonstrated by both Robert Sean Leonard's character and that of Ethan Hawke, two very fine leads in this film. I'm not a parent but like the Virgin Suicides this sent a very strong message to me - let your children pursue their dreams not yours. Robin Williams' teacher embodies all that teaching should be, yes you need to pass exams to an extent but education is also about learning about your peers, yourself and appreciating if that is your thing great books, art and performance and tolerance of other beliefs, viewpoints etc than yours even if you don't accept them. What a wonderful thing it is and how it can enable you to see life in such a different manner. <br/><br/>I still cry to this day at the final scene where the boys - they still are really, know an injustice has taken place and finally learn to stand by what they believe in.

"teacherlogan","10","0","0","14 March 2007"," A tremendous film of passion and independence
","A ridged boarding school nestled within the New England countryside. A promising young professor is inspiring his students using unique, if untraditional, methods. A small group of independent boys are challenging the establishment by re-instituting a secret literary society. These are the forces at work in the movie Dead Poets Society. A movie about an independent spirit caged within a structured realm. A movie about the power of learning and the passion that comes from applying what you know to what you love.<br/><br/>Robin Williams plays Professor John Keating a poetry teacher at a traditional male boarding school. His unorthodox methods strike an immediate chord with his students, most notably Neil Perry. Neil is the only son of an overbearing father and driven to excel. Keating's class focuses on the passion of poetry, not the mundane qualities of meter and verse. Keating's enthusiasm is contagious and leads Neil and several of his classmates to create the 'Dead Poets Society', a secret literary club that meets after hours. Such activity is against school policy. Neil is further lead to the stage and his true love, theater. He does so in knowing defiance of his father's wishes.<br/><br/>The conflict in this film is the very height of hypocrisy. The boarding school prides itself on raising the best young men in society. Yet the overseers are threatened by free-thinking youths. They value good grades and accolades, but shun original ideas and independent thought. While applied knowledge and excitement for learning should be embraced, the school views such activities as immature distractions from the greater goal of academic excellence.<br/><br/>Keating is the exact opposite. He values free thinking and expression. He encourages his students to follow their hearts and dreams. It is not that he does not value academia. We know he is an alumnus of the school and understands the rigorous standards by which all the boys are measured. But he is a firm believer that information learned can be information lost without context. As a poetry teacher, the context he gives is to understand the emotion that drives both the author and the reader. As a teacher with a love for the subject, he feels duty bound to instill that energy in his students. He succeeds admirably.<br/><br/>Robin Williams is a master at delivering a dramatic performance while not losing his comic edge. Known for slapstick comedy, he can tone it down when appropriate. Physical comedy is replaced with clever wit. Overblown antics are replaced with perfect comic timing. As a teacher, he is engaging, witty and funny. As a mentor to Neil, he is compassionate, insightful and supportive. The delicate balance between humor and drama that Robin Williams can bring to a role is a talent that he has perfected.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is a film with multi-faceted plot layers. We are enthralled by Keating's unique classroom instruction and the backlash unleashed by the establishment. We are intrigued by the secret Dead Poets Society and its mystical qualities. We are torn between Neil's desires to pursue acting and his father's pressures of medical school. No plot line is independent. Each one flows together with effortless fluidity.<br/><br/>The film gels around the central theme of passion; a passion for teaching, a passion for theater, a passion for academic excellence. Every character is passionate, even those we do not agree with. Neil's father is passionate about the road he has mapped out for his son. This is in direct conflict with Neil. Conflict leads to turmoil and ultimately to tragedy. Each character's passion and beliefs is instrumental in stoking that fire.<br/><br/>We applaud people with passion, as too much of daily life is devoid of it. Dead Poets Society reminds us that passion is a powerful force worth embracing. In the same way, Dead Poets Society is a tremendous film worth embracing and enjoying, again and again."

And even if I choke on the bone, I'll always be a dead poet, I'll let them think I'm dead. Cause they can't see life. And life isn't a writing set. So stop wasting your time, go out, find love and most of all BE POETS! Dare to dream - I'll give that to Paris. Hear your own barbaric YAWPs, step up the desks of ignorance and enjoy yourselves.

"pyrocitor","9","0","0","5 January 2007"," Sucking the marrow out of life
","Every once in a while, a film comes along which stands the test of time. A film which, ten years later or more can still hold the same emotional resonance and merit as it did when it was first released, and still be renowned as a genuinely quality piece. Dead Poets Society is one of those films which has withstood the ages, becoming somewhat iconic as a charming, but never cheesy sentimental tearjerker and uplifting tale of passion and hope all the same. When one watches it, it's really no wonder why the movie has lasted - there is simply so much to appreciate here, and never once does the film seem fake, as if the ideals are being beaten over our heads - they are simply presented in an optimistic light, attempting to sweep us up in their sense of enthusiasm and passion as well. <br/><br/>It's movies like this which really bring the education system to light, and make us wonder if perhaps inspirationally different teachers such as the simply wonderful Robin Williams' John Keating were more commonplace, inspiring their students with a sheer passion for language and verse. Teachers who rather than beating the students down by throwing meaningless figures and statistics in their faces, actually encouraged their students to think for themselves, draw their own conclusions, and actually striving to ""seize the day"" and get all that they can out of life, instead of coasting aimlessly through it. It's in this aspect than any viewer with a soft spot for English literature and poetry especially is sure to melt shamelessly towards the sheer passion and emotion associated with them. Rather than poems being sappy and tedious, Keating brings the idea to life with fiery enthusiasm, making the author's sentiments leap off the page and into the heart. <br/><br/>What raises Dead Poets Society from the ranks of other wannabes in its genre of ""education can be good"" films is how genuine and real it all seems, which makes the uplifting message seem all the more affecting, as it never seems contrived or sappy. The characters never once seem contrived, though they may be archetypes, these are real, breathing human beings we are watching, and we connect with them and care for them at a level which is almost unseen in modern movies. It's a genuinely heartwarming and affecting story, sold excellently by screenwriter Tom Schulman and driven home by the superb cast and seamless direction by the wonderful Peter Weir. Weir has a knack for filling his films with single unforgettable images, and Dead Poets Society is perhaps the most potent in this aspect - there are too many unforgettable scenes and shots to be counted, from Knox Overstreet riding his bike down the hill, scattering a flock of geese which fly up into the amber sunset, the soccer game where the students carry Mr. Keating on their shoulders, and of course the classic standing on desks scene. Without giving away the film's plot, safe to say this is a movie which sticks in your head for weeks to come. The film does on occasion show the slightest stumble in terms of plot or pacing, and not all audiences may buy into the sentimentality of the plot, but these are pittances for a film as genuine, affecting and simply spectacular as this. <br/><br/>The simply wonderful cast, full mostly of previously unknown actors is what really brings the film to life, presenting us with a wide variety of realistic, relatable and for the most part, infectiously likable characters. Standouts include a pre-stardom Ethan Hawke as the shy and withdrawn Todd, TV actor Robert Sean Leonard as aspiring actor Neil, Gale Hansen, arguably stealing the show from all but Robin Williams as the wonderfully rebellious Charlie ""Nuwanda"" Dalton, and Josh Charles as the bashfully confident Knox Overstreet. ""That 70s show"" actor Kurtwood Smith proves that no one is better at playing the disproving old fashioned father than he is and Norman Lloyd makes a fiendishly evil villain as the repressive school headmaster. Still, there is no argument that the film without exception belongs to Robin Williams as perhaps the most wonderful teacher figure ever essayed on film. Williams sparks the film ablaze with his fiery passion and enthusiasm, never once going over the top but instead biting back his trademark energy to turn out a serious, superbly fine tuned and tremendously affecting performance, arguably still the best his career has shown. <br/><br/>All in all, Dead Poets Society is one of those movies which actually fit the far too often used category of ""must see"". For all struggling through months and years of tedious, repressive schooling, this movie should prove the perfect antidote, re-affirming the sense of enthusiasm and passion which would make the education system so much easier to bear, and actually inspire students to succeed in life, rather than coasting through with no enjoyment or enthusiasm. Robin Williams gives a superb performance, and director Peter Weir has accomplished a wonderful film which is sweet but not syrupy, passion and sentimentality devoid of sap. For a heartwarming, inspiring and moving movie experience, one need look no further than here.<br/><br/>-9/10"

It's simply a great movie.

","It's easy to recognize the cinematic brilliance of ""Dead Poets Society"". The script is dripping with insightful dialog and dramatic nuance, and director Peter Weir drew out distinctly emotional performances from his entire cast, particularly Robin Williams, who has never given a finer performance. That's all easy to observe. What's less apparent but definitely there is the importance of this film with respect to our daily lives. This picture does not exist solely for the purpose to entertain (which it does manage to do fantastically), but also to stress the influence of both conformity and individuality on one's life.<br/><br/>The story tracks the events of a group of students of a New England boarding school. The boys are inspired by the powerful example of their English teacher and free spirit, John Keating (Williams), to initiate a secret club that sneaks off to read poetry in the woods after hours. Be not fooled by this seemingly hokey premise. As the boys become engulfed by their new-found sense of nonconformity, so will you become engulfed by the story and its characters.<br/><br/>But only once film is finished will you appreciate how precious your individuality is, and just how much some have to sacrifice to attain theirs.<br/><br/>Whether you're a conscious individual, someone struggling to find their own voice, or just have a real passion for great poetry, it is doubtless that the message of ""Dead Poets Society"" is one that can speak to you.<br/><br/>Carpe Diem!"

","A good movie moves people and makes them want to watch it twice. Though the translation isn't perfect so that I didn't understand it fully, but which didn't prevent me from flooding inside. 　　 　　For the teacher, John Keating 　　A teacher, who asked his students to rip the preface of the book, who taught every lesson in a unique way, named Keating. You may discover his ambition as well as his misgivings at his first appearing in the opening ceremony of a new term. And I found him a great teacher who made students realize "" Carpe Diem "" which means "" to seize the day "" in his first lesson, who asked his boys to stand on the desk "" to view the world in an new way "", who inspired Todd Anderson whose huge inner talent broke out then, who guided Neal to negotiate with his father and comforted him and assured him not being trapped, who cried badly while discovering the poetry anthology, five centuries of verse, which he had read before and wrote inspiring words on, in Neal's desk, who left at last with his thanks and smile, who is respectable. You may consider Keating had ended with a failure, for his students died or dispelled, for the Dead Society Society broke up and the school turned back to its original tradition at last. But you can't ignore the significant influence he made on his students, on Todd, on Neal, on each member in the Society (though he didn't encourage his students to found it at all), on everyone including us, the spectators. You also can't deny what the boys behaved in the last scene is exactly Keating's triumph. 　　 　　For Neil Perry 　　The excellent guy who owns a virtue of optimism, kind-heart, responsibility, persistence, passion and leadership. And he is also the new founder of Dead Poets Society, an age later. With Neal's encouragement and organization, the Society made its sense. A friend told me that he realized someone would die in the first scene, the picture of former members of the Society, together with the heavy melody in the movie. However, I didn't sense it until Neal took on the coronal and off, in the moon light, naked. Anyway, it's beyond my expectation that he had chosen death as the way to fight against his father's arrangement, order and reproach. Are dreams so gentle in front of the facts? While, just as most poets did, he didn't find a hope in the very verge of despair. 　　How could fate so cruel to such a good boy? I was perplexed, though I didn't burst into tears, a tough stir meant more, and the anguish must be much easier than Todd and Keating. 　　 　　For Todd Anderson 　　Neal's roommate, the boy who is a definitely good student, with all the merits called for in the traditional and principled high school, who turned downed down to go to the carve at first, who wrote and revised his own poem again and again by himself, whose face turned red and anxious in the class while Keating asking students to read their own poems on the platform. And he refused the offer as usual. Nevertheless, he's talent was discovered by Mr. Keating, his captain. He shouted ""his teeth is sweating"" by the inspiration of Keating, and his marvelous inner talent shook everyone, ""Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold. You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. Kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying, to the movement we leave dying, it'll just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream"", weren't you? And his significant change proved Keating's success fully. He dare expressed his redemption and regret and miser and thanks in such a courageous way, such an extra ordinate way and such a proper way, to stand on the desk, just as what Keating taught them, and to call ""Captain, my captain"", the greatest name we can call a teacher. 　　 　　To some extent, he is the one with whom I shared most common points, especially at the same age, 3 or 4 years ago, sensitive, introverted, dares not to express his inner heart, self-abased, scholastic. But the difference lies in that he's inspired by Mr. Keating; he's helped by his roommate, Neal. But, who's my Mr. Keating, who's my Neal? And, where are my passions, my dreams now? Have they all gone? I fell so cold, but I decide to find them out. <br/><br/>　　For dream 　　 　　Fighting against reality, ideal turned out to be fragile. However, in the shine of the dream, the common custom shows its cowardice. If not, betrayer of the Society wouldn't lowered his voice reading ""what is poem"" at the traditional new teacher's order, on the preface that Keating asked them to have ripped, when the captain of his dream saw him. There is surely important to have a dream, but it is even more important to hold it on. That's maybe the reason I failed to cry out, to let out my emotions, because I feel guilty somehow. Times and times, the strong music beats at my heart heavily, and I ask myself where my dreams are. Where are they? Have they deserved me when I am busy study for exams? Or I am left alone because of my laziness and easy-satisfying? 　　 　　I ask my captain, how long it leaves to our fearful trip? 　　Captain answered, don't be afraid, we bound to arriving. 　　I ask my captain, what is the direction of my dream? 　　Captain answered, follow you heart, and heart will tell you. 　　 　 　　Yes, my captain, it's time for me to follow my heart."

","My sixteen year old daughter and I just finished watching Dead Poets Society (me for the thousandth time), and I've also read some of the comments left. For me, this movie was not about poetry or life in private schools, it is a lesson on standing up (sometimes on a desk) in the face of conformity. From the moment we enter school, we are are taught to sit in a row, be quiet, do not ask questions, do not interrupt the class and on and on. This proves wonderful training for when the young minds leave formal education behind and enter the work world, where you are encouraged to sit quietly, not ask questions and do not interrupt. To have the opportunity to learn from someone who believes that education is more than rot memory and regurgitating facts is indeed spectacular, potentially life-altering and unfortunately rare. What I hold so dear about this movie, is that Keating does this; he teaches the value of individual thought, life, and beauty, and his students in return show their understanding, love and respect in the desk scene in the end.<br/><br/>Young minds all over the world are just waiting to be filled; take care what you fill the with."

Thankfully the young students in this story have an empathic teacher who teaches them not to accept a clichéd world. Some other teacher might have taught them to rebel with violence - which is so easy for misguided youth to learn and do, but not this teacher! The strongest expressions of rebellion he teaches them are tearing up books and standing on the class bench.

This film changes the audiences lives and make them feel into the film,because they talk about problems and subjects present in our society and make the audience think deeply about them as well as Mr Keating does in the film.After seen it everybody wants to ""be more"",and you feel you can ""be more"" if you simply ""SEIZE YOUR DAY""."

","Well acted light drama with talented young and mature actors that show excellent chemistry between them.<br/><br/>Robin Williams delivers an over the top (but justified) performance as the ""cool"" teacher that is against the rigid manners of a conservative college for rich and spoiled young men. His students love him because he teaches them to squeeze and suck the day, ""carpe diem"". Most of the students have little or absent right to choose what they want from life as their parents are more or less than dictators. In their philosophy class, they can dream and act they way they want and that's why they think Williams' character is a hero or something like that.<br/><br/>Sadly, one of these students as any other young optimistic men follows his dream and becomes an actor against his father's will. He has the talents and the optimistic point of view but soon after he makes his debut in a play, his father punishes him the hardest way a father can do.<br/><br/>Watch ""Dead Poets Society"" to witness how men at a young age can be very optimistic with their ideals. The movie also shows that learning methods don't necessary have to be rigid or antiquate. But the movie is truly more than that; it's a moving movie with the usual family humor.<br/><br/>Great performances by Williams and Hawke who demonstrated to be a promising actor."

","SPOILER!!! I completely loved Dead Poets Society. It's definitely my favorite movie of all time. all of the actors are amazing, and i follow some of the actors work now... namely Robert Sean Leonard, Neil Perry, and Ethan Hawke, Todd Anderson. Great film, would recommend it to anyone, any time!! When Neil kills himself at the end of the film, I cried, cause i loved him. He was such a good guy, including Todd at the beginning when he had no friends. What i liked the most about Robert's character is how he was friends with everyone. Everyone was sad when he died, and though the other boys had their 'Tiffs' he wanted everyone to be friends. On a whole, great script, great cast, great sets and great MOVIE!!"

","After having seen some of Peter Weirs other films(The Plumber,The Cars that ate Paris,The Green Card.)i decide to watch this.I have to say i feel this is one of his best films,thats a very strong character-driven film. The plot: In the 50s,new student Tood Anderson is sent to the same school where his brother did fantastically.While he is trying to play things down about his brother,he starts getting on with people at the school and gets a friend(Neil.)The thing that changes them is the new English teacher Mr Keating,who Tells them they should ""be themselves"" and not ""act like sheep"".Tood and Neil find out that Mr Keating used to be in a club called The Dead Poets society.After hearing about this,Tood and Neil decide to re-open the club to get themselves ""Free"",this will sadly end with one of them tacking there own life.... View on the film: The screenplay:written by Tom Schulman,while the film has a bit of a thin plot,Schulman makes the film feel like a really great European-type character driven film.The other things that is done very well is the change halfway into the film,where it takes on a very dark turn.While most movies would find it hard to change gears like that,this movie does it really well. The cast:The cast do a really good job at making the people feel very real.You can feel Williams moving away from his (very good)comedies,to giving really great performances for dramas.But,the main stand outs are Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leondas as Tood and Neil.They both give really great performances that make you feel they really are friends,and that when Neil dies,Hawke does a great job at showing the sadness he has,for losing a friend in such a sad way. Direction:Peter Weire does a fantastic job,at showing how the film (over the films time-line)changes.From something that looks really picture-perfect,that could be from an old faded photo album,to some very dark and disturbing images.(With very strong religious overtones-aseptically in the suicide scene.)But Weire always makes sure that the characters are the centre piece of the film.The other thing Weir did great and was very different (at the time) for getting a really good,serious performance out of Robin Williams. Final view on the film: A really great character-driven film,with a great cast,direction and a very moving story."

"esvloring","8","0","0","20 June 2006"," Entertaining but Flawed
","First the flaws: 1) The Headmaster is too broad a character. When he mounts the podium at the beginning of the school year, the stern and set expression on his face sets him off as a hidebound traditionalist and curmudgeon. He is the obvious villain here. No free spirit - like Mr. Keating - will last long under him. 2) We viewers are not prepared for Neil's suicide. Through most of the movie he comes across as a well-adjusted seventeen year old. He gets along well with the other boys. He is a natural leader. His penchant for acting appears to stem from serendipity, young male exuberance, and fun. Despite his martinet of a father he does not lie in bed long hours brooding, nor does he ever come across as depressed or manic. So when his father threatens to withdraw him from Welton after his successful debut in a Midsummer Night's Dream, he might argue with his father or turn sullen, but it strains credulity that he would go to directly to suicide. Now the qualities: 3) The production values are excellent. The location is idyllic - New Castle, Delaware is as elegant in reality as it looks in the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, at times lyrical. And the period details are right - like the boys smoking whenever grownups are out of the room - without being forced. 4) I particularly appreciated the acting of Neil's father. He has probably grown up under humble circumstances, and through enormous self-discipline, long hours and weekends of hard work, and seizing the rare opportunities that have come his way, has achieved modest financial success and comfort. At least once he tells Neil how much he has sacrificed for Neil's education at Welton. Neil's a good kid; he's getting straight A's. Like so many fathers in real life this father can't understand his adolescent son. His threat to withdraw Neil from Welton and send him to military school is so extreme it borders on the implausible. I fault the script, not the acting."

The film opens up a range of ideas, beginning with freedom of expression, and ending with ultimate affirmation of life.  But, even amongst all of this, the ideas themselves are not great, mindbreaking, life changing ideas, they are simple ideas, that are easy to implement, and that can be brought into our own lives.

","""Dead Poets Society"" is a remarkable film, and one that I simply cannot praise or recommend enough.  Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, a new teacher at a private boys school in 1959.  His unorthodox teaching methods, designed to make his pupils more aware of the topics and to encourage them to open up to each other more, are viewed with apprehension and derision by his work colleagues but begin to leave an impression on each of his pupils.  They soon go on to start a 'Dead Poets Society', in which they go into the woods at night and read poetry to each other.  However, tragedy strikes and Keating's teaching is thought to be to blame by the other members of staff.<br/><br/>Amusing, compelling and often moving, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a wonderfully acted piece with a good young cast (including Ethan Hawke in an early role). Most exceptional of all is Robin Williams who plays his role of the inspirational leader to a group of people at a crossroads in their lives to absolute perfection, proving once and for all that not only is he one of the greatest comedy performers of all time, he is equally adept at playing it straight, and he certainly deserves to be recognised more for his talents.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, make sure you do, you won't be disappointed."

","Robin Williams is Professor John Keating who takes over an English poetry class.  He is a revolutionary in that he tells his class to ""suck the marrow out of life"" and seize the day.  I thought that this would be a drag from the title, but it is misleading in that it shows the lives of several students in the authoritarian school of 1950's America, which is at times humourous and sad.<br/><br/>Williams should play more of these kind of roles.  He has lost his way a bit in recent times with such trash as ""What dreams may come"" and ""Flubber"". Check this movie out for some fine acting and a good story."

But, for me, it is the one that succeeds best, outclassing even the much acclaimed American Beauty by placing the message into a much deeper, more profound shell.<br/><br/>The story is that of an English Literature teacher who comes to profess into the highschool from which he graduated several years ago, a highschool of great tradition who praised discipline, respect and... well, tradition. John Keating starts by totally surprising his students with his unconventional teaching approach and ends up, in a very short period, by changing his students' way of seeing the world, helping them start thinking for themselves, seeing things through their own eyes, in short, helping them develop a personality.<br/><br/>Of course, all this initiative, doubled by the unusual teaching methods which involved exercises in the courtyard, playing soccer, etc. is not well seen by the other professors and by the children parents. This conflict will evolve into a sad, but extremely touching ending, that manages to transmit the clear message that was intended.<br/><br/>This is a simple but very powerful movie by director Peter Weir (Truman Show, Fearless) and displays one of the best (my favourite) performances by Robin Williams as John Keating together with a very believable interpretation by a group of young actors.<br/><br/>See this movie and try to learn the lesson and live by its teachings.

I've yet to meet a teacher who hasn't been inspired by this film.  This one film (and perhaps a couple of others) have probably inspired more people to become teachers,(or to crack open a poetry anthology or attend a poetry reading) than most people realize.   (Myself included) It helped inspire educators to take on more creative forms of teaching, and even today challenges such movements as the Dammed SOLs.  Yup, it even made the phrase ""Carpe Diem"" the well known (probably overused) slogan it is today.  Yeah, the story is pretty melodramatic and obvious, just like the ones in, say, Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, African Queen, On the Waterfront and nearly any other classic film I can think of.

In an age where Adam Sandler films are the big box office draws, and Jim Carrey movies are studied for artistic merit, this small film is an example of what Hollywood needs to target.  Directors often get wrapped up in elaborate technology, but forget that plot is the driving mechanism in all film and literature.  I relate this film in some ways to another great Robin Williams movie, ""Good Will Hunting.""  Both movies show that audiences still can be touched with intelligent and marked references to classic literature, and the themes contained in the work of anyone from Shakespeare to Cummings can be transferred to a modern audience.  Although I am off the point of this movie in among itself, my point on a larger scale is that Hollywood needs more pointed, smart, touching films.  I would rather indulge in a repeat viewing of a movie like ""Dead Poets"" as opposed to seeing what ""new spin"" has been added to the dead romantic comedy category.

","There are several lessons to be learned in Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society,"" and while I could go into all of them here, the film teaches them far more eloquently than I ever could.<br/><br/>The movie also has several layers.  For instance, there is Professor John Keating (Robin Williams).  He's the new kid on the block, the teacher nobody quite trusts.  He's willing to try absolutely anything to reach his students, and he does.  As I watched Keating work his magic, I was reminded of all my greatest teachers, and it is obvious that Keating is largely taken from real life.  Writer Tom Schulman only made up part of him, because there really are teachers as powerful and as daring as him.  I've had many of them.<br/><br/>There are also the students played by Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, and others.

","Dead Poets Society is an absolutely marvelous film. It is a true gem. The story is one of the best stories that appeared on the silver screen. Robin Williams did a fantastic performance as Mr. Keating, a teacher at a boarding school who gives inspiration to his classmates to have a mind of their own and to love poetry and other forms of creativity. The kids in his class think he's more than a teacher, and as the movie goes on it shows how the kids need his help with their own problems, and how Keating has a problem of his own that is a major tragedy to the kids. The kids also discover that he was part of a group called the Dead Poets Society where they sneaked out of the High School Boarding School and go to a cave where they read poetry to each other and let it drip from their tongues, like honey. The kids decide to start the group up again themselves, so they go out to the cave, where they read poetry. That's when one of the kids does a very stupid thing which gives away their secret to the school. Not only does this effect their lives, but Mr. Keating's as well. Don't think that this movie is all inspiration. It has many tragedies involving the kids' personal problems. The whole movie fits so well together with all the different stories in it, I have to respect director Peter Weir A LOT! Although Robin Williams does a fantastic performance, Ethan Hawke's character, Todd, was my favorite in this masterpiece. This is definitely up with Gattaca and the Star Wars series as my favorite movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes drama movies. It is a definite masterpiece!"

","`Why didn't I have a teacher like that when I was at school?' That's what people's repugnant mouths expunge when I mention this film. `Robin Williams managed to reach out to the kids and taught them that being an individual was something worth striving for.'<br/><br/>Try that around me, and I'll PUNCH your stupid face in! That's right I'd use violence, and if I were a teacher I would use violence on the kids as well, and possibly some pensioners!  Why? Because it's all very well having a decent teacher who can reach out to the kids', but most children now are some evil, twisted, yuppie spawn who dwell on pain and suffering. Think ET would have been safe if children had found him? Not in this century! They'd probably throw him on some train lines or strap him to the bonnet of a Ferrari and ram raid Toys R Us.<br/><br/>I mean, I was actually at school and it was nothing like it was in this film. If we'd found out there was a Dead Poets Society' they'd have been tracked down and duffed over as soon as possible. Heck, if we found out that one of the boys in school had found an alien in his back garden and had somehow become emotionally bonded' to him, we'd have gone around there and beaten them both up.<br/><br/>`Don't deviate from the norm!' That's what we'd have shouted, because it is wrong to deviate from the norm. Look at that guy with the beard in Die Hard, the one who says, `Hans, I can help you get this guy.' He deviated from everybody else and died. Although maybe Hans Gruber thought that he was a bulimic Peter Jackson and shot him anyway. I'm not sure.<br/><br/>There's this bit in Dead Poets Society' where Robin Williams (who's not dressed as a woman this time) gets all the boys to walk around the playground, and they all fall into step. That's wrong apparently. What's wrong with being normal? I'm normal and people are always calling me a freak' or a pervert', so god knows what it would have been like if I was deranged or different in some way. <br/><br/>So I think that Dead Poets Society' is a bad film because it teaches children that being different is good, and is probably responsible for people like Hannibal Lecter, who thought that rather than eating normal food he'd be different and eat people instead. That's not normal and is also wrong."

","The overwhelming feeling I had from this movie was it was contrived, rather than a moral that grew out of a story I found it a story that grew out of a moral, rather like a fable.<br/><br/>I Thought the screenplay poor although as a story it was OK, apart from many cinematographic highs it has many bad movie making points, it lacks narrative and at times seems disjointed. It could have been done better if rather than just concentrate purley on the lessons with the English teacher they had other lessons with other teachers who had differing more traditional methods it could have added conflict between teachers, meaning to many pointless scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>Williams is superb and so are most of the boys, and a real feel of the 50's is created. Many of the situations ""created"" or contrived to prove the moral to me are ridiculous and quite pointless.<br/><br/>The big failure for me is the ending I find that the lads suicide is ridiculous and simply would not have happened to the boys character did the writer never hear of the character arc We needed to see more persecution of the lad by the father and other teachers, maybe even a little of the Mothers life and love for her son living under a dictatorial Father ( this was hinted at but not exploited to dramatic effect) . Its a good movie to see if you need uplifting and many will get a kick from it and I can understand why.

"MovieAddict2016","Null","2","5","30 July 2004"," A guy's weepie -- if you're into ""this kind"" of movie. Unfortunately I'm not. (And how did this ever get 38,000 votes??!!)
","First off let me say that I am not particularly fond of this sort of film. I feel that it has been done over and over and over again, since the major success of the formula with this film. We've seen THE EMPEROR'S CLUB, MONA LISA SMILE, SCHOOL OF ROCK, SISTER ACT, and many other rip-offs (some good, most poor) that fail to establish the warmth of this one.<br/><br/>That's the problem -- DEAD POETS SOCIETY is all gooey; all warmth. It's well-made, and I can certainly understand why some might love it. But for me it's a bit too controlling and sentimental. Most of the characters are cliches. I had a hard time ""getting into"" the movie, and once I did, I'll admit that it became interesting -- but it's not gripping at all. It takes focus.<br/><br/>Which is a good thing I suppose. I'm a fan of gentle, soft epics -- but this one is sugar-coated a bit too thick. It comes across as utterly unconvincing and, at times, yes, even annoying.<br/><br/>For some reason most comedians feel they need to prove to the world that they can act. With Robin Williams, the problem is that he's not a particularly great actor, mainly because every time we hear him speak we're reminded of his early days as a comedian. There's something generally funny about the guy.<br/><br/>I love GOOD WILL HUNTING but have a hard time taking him seriously most of the time. Every time he opens his mouth I feel like I'm supposed to laugh or something. Him playing a serial killer in INSOMNIA is admirable, but at the same time, rather laughable. He's just not the sort of guy who would have ever gotten a career through acting -- even his voice sounds comedic, and when he tries to play serious characters, he has a hard time controlling himself (see this for proof -- he's constantly acting like a hyper-active man-child).<br/><br/>So...the acting is great and Williams DOES give a good performance, but I have a hard time taking him seriously. Peter Weir is a great director but essentially I just feel he layered this one a bit too thick with controlling, contrived sentimentality.<br/><br/>It's a shame.<br/><br/>NOTE: I am in no way suggesting that you will not like this movie, and am not bashing it. Don't feel the need to send me hate letters -- I recommend this film to anyone who thinks they might enjoy it. However, if you ""know"" it's not your sort of movie, chances are you WON'T like it. I liked it, but didn't love it, and had a hard time focusing most of the time, mainly because I felt distanced from what was happening.<br/><br/>I was watching it with a girl who said, ""This is such a guy's movie,"" and left the room in disgust. Ironically I was just thinking the opposite -- ""this is such a 'chick flick'.""<br/><br/>So I got to thinking...if this is a film targeted towards guys -- which it obviously is (it covers all ground of male trials and tribulations)...then why is it so damned ""gooey""?<br/><br/>And as a final reflection...how on earth did this get 38,000 votes from IMDb users? I understand that it's a famous film, regarded as a well-made ""classic"" of its genre...but honestly I thought I'd see about 17,000 - 21,000 votes. 38,000 votes is close to the amount THE LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING had last time I checked. THE TERMINATOR is only 12,000 ahead, and between the two, which do YOU see referenced more in pop culture?<br/><br/>Anyway...this is a poor review, so don't send me any hate mail -- I already know...<br/><br/>Great acting only makes this worth recommending."

","We watched this movie for the last period of our career choice class. We were a class of 14 to 16 year old watching a movie about poetry. Teenagers today aren't really fond of poetry. If you get were I'm coming from..when there was a fight, i think the whole class wanted it to end up like one has a black eye and bleeding nose and other stuff than just a simple punch and there it was over. The movie was so long it never ended. Even when the Neil guy died..we kinda wanted to see him shoot himself and see a lot of blood and not just parents running everywhere and finding a gun on the perfectly clean floor. By the end, since like 3/4 of the class was gone on a field trip, we were about 10 in the class, nobody was watching it..i was just walking everywhere talking to people, some people were shooting paper balls into the recycle bin from the other end of the class. We were so glad when the movie ended. It was especially weird when Robin Williams wanted his class to call him Ô Captain..strange.<br/><br/>Don't take it to personally, but i think it's more of a parent movie to watch together and not a movie that you would see with you're whole family.

"patchdyer","4","2","6","23 May 2011"," Could have been more
","(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS) I saw this movie about 3 years ago on TV and really enjoyed it. I thought there was strong emotional depth, impressive acting, and a well-structured storyline. However, the next time I saw it which was about a year ago, I was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong; it's not a horrible movie. It's just not as engaging as I thought it was. A lot of this does have to do with its tired, overused premise: the rebellious students oppose conservative, authoritative parents with the help of their liberal teacher. Now, you can take any premise and make it into a good movie, but DEAD POETS SOCIETY doesn't bother to give us anything fresh or insightful. It's just ""Find yourself"" and ""Seize the Day!"" and ""Believe and you will succeed"" for 2 hours.<br/><br/>I still think the acting is generally fine, mostly from the kids. I'm surprised that only Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard were the only ones that went anywhere after this movie (correct me if I'm wrong). The adults aside from Williams however are not as effective. They're just stereotypical, hard-core conservative snobs who want to only keep the kids from ""expressing who they truly are in life."" Not much depth is given to them. Robin Williams is good too, but not as spectacular as most people claim him to be. When he's on screen, he's enjoyable and effective. When he's not, I don't miss him. I guess it has to do with the fact that there's not much to his character. He's just a wise, caring, liberal teacher who only wants to help his students. That's not bad, but he seems more like a representation of the movie's idea of Carpe Diem than an actual character. Mr. Keating also acts more like a plot device because he is only around when he's either a) teaching a class, or b) helping a student(s) outside of class. I guess that's why I don't miss him when he's not on screen. The rest of the movie is about the kids taking his lessons and applying to their daily lives. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been better if we saw Keating more than just the teacher/moral support. Bland characterization, however, is not the only problem I have with this film.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me is the third act when the Robert Sean Leonard kid commits suicide. What the heck happened?! I would be emotionally involved if the film bothered to show signs of him struggling with suicidal thoughts. But this seems so sudden and out of nowhere. The kid does the play, his father doesn't approve, and he kills himself. That doesn't work. This is the part that makes me wonder why this movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (especially against the likes of CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS and SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE) because when I see a movie that has a sporadic act of tragedy, I don't think, ""Oh, my goodness! This is so sad and moving!"" I think, ""What the heck? Did the screenwriter run out of ideas?"" Here's the thing: Suicide can be a powerful dramatic tool if handled correctly. It can work in a story that sets itself up as a tragedy. But this movie sets itself up more as an inspirational and uplifting drama, so this act of despair seems out of place. Even at the end where the kids stand up on their desks and protest, I still had a hard time getting past that kid's suicide. Another thing that bothers me about this is that it's such a cheap way to show how damaging conservative attitudes can be and how helpful liberal attitudes can be. This can be an effective lesson but here it's told clumsily. The screenwriter forces the audience to care instead of simply telling a story and allowing the audience to be naturally affected by it. I'm sure the person who wrote the script meant well, but this comes across as a little condescending. It seems like he's saying, ""Care for these characters right now!"" I'll feel what I'll feel, just show us these people and their lives.<br/><br/>That's all I can think of for now. Hopefully, I didn't rant too much. I understand why people like this movie because there are a couple of good scenes and again the kids do a great job. But personally, I think the movie just needed to avoid the clichés and dig deeper to become something really meaningful and poignant."

It seems like a pretty good message, right? He teaches his students to think for themselves, he offers them a voice (poetic and otherwise), and along the way, the students get to read some pretty important poetry, which, by the way, they learn to love.

"ElMaruecan82","6","1","2","25 October 2011"," Teach them the passion of learning,not the learning of passion ...
","The first time I saw ""Dead Poets Society"" at 16, I liked it BUT my appreciation was undermined by the fact that many high school teachers were screening this and ""Good Will Hunting"" to us. I guess their pedagogic value didn't leave them indifferent, nor the inspirational message about learning to think by ourselves, and to forge well-made rather than well-filled heads. Now I'm almost thirty, I saw the film several times, I read Roger Ebert's infamous review, I went to prep school, then a prestigious business school, I had my share of dreams and conflicts with my father, enough to build a second and more constructive opinion.<br/><br/>On the surface, ""Dead Poets Society"" ticks all the boxes of the great film begging for a Best Picture nomination, the impressive direction, the dazzling cinematography, the inspirational score, the sober setting, the supporting characters implying numerous subplots enriching the story and on the top of that: the inspirational message lying beneath an endearing script, full of poetry and an intelligent hymn to the extraordinary value of life. ""Dead Poets Society"" is a remarkable cinematic achievement BUT isn't life too complex a concept to be only defined by the duality of oppression/repression, conservatism/freedom. Are we either free- spirited or close-minded? Peter Weir can't prevent the script from falling into inexcusably manipulative clichés. <br/><br/>The movie sins by oversimplification, when it could have developed a more human and realistic approach instead of the whole hysteria that invokes romantic poetry as a dream builder. <br/><br/>On that level, I've always had a problem with Neil's suicide. I couldn't put my finger why, until I had an important discussion with my father. I revealed that everything I did was out of fear of disappointing him. He invested a lot of hopes for my future, but in the end, I was unhappy, and wished I could fulfill my personal, artistic dreams. I will never forget his answer. It was my entire fault, and I was just so lazy I couldn't do something on my own. I waited for a support when I could at least give a try and present him with a fait accompli. He was right, all I did was comforting my thinking with the fallacious idea that I would never make my dreams true as long as he disapproved. Parents are notorious for being the first dream-killers, but believing it's an insurmountable obstacle is the sign of a level of immaturity so high, that any anti-conformism would fatally lead to irresponsible decisions anyway.<br/><br/>Neil had choices. By leaving the house, he would have tried to live by himself, to become an adult. Through an existential impulse, as the most authentic illustration of the 'Carpe Diem' motto, instead of killing himself; he would have symbolically killed his father, and become a man... OR ...he could have considered the possibility to study theater in Harvard. Neil acted out of cowardice, starting by a lie that would have naturally upset his domineering father. The suicide killed the very purpose of the film, by trying to point an accusing finger on an oppressive system, responsible of Neil's act while the mise en scene was so overdone that it failed to show it as an act of despair.<br/><br/>This Manichean approach falls in lamentably formulaic plot devices, in order to make Keating the scapegoat of a fascist system, while Neil is the only one to blame. Or, for that matter, the writer, who probably thought that 'death' is so cinematically impacting, it's the only way to solve a problem, while it's pure opportunistic dramatization.<br/><br/>Anyway, Neil was the leader of the group : with his death, all the wannabe-poets were reduced to a bunch of recycled stereotypes, illustrating the worst influence an anti-establishment mind can have on spoiled rich kids with the right predispositions for pseudo rebellion. The most outrageous, yet realistic one is the use of poetry to impress and seduce girls. At least, one was sincere in his Don Juan role, while the other could have been more responsible and respect the fact that the girl he wanted was with another boy. Anyway, the romantic subplot was dull and predictable and reduced poetry to a bunch of slogans made up to 'get the girl'. I had a guy in high school who published poems dedicated to some classmates (all girls naturally) and they were all meowing over how sweet it was. As a poem writer myself, I couldn't help but question the motivation behind these writings.<br/><br/>(I won't go further with the other characters, one was labeled as the official villain, with no redeeming quality, and the two nerdy guys played the comic relief part, I liked it when they danced rock'n'roll but who the hell were these two guys fencing outside ?)<br/><br/>Poetry as seduction or poetry as therapy to overcome a sickly shyness, in the content, the whole course of Mr. Keating is a show, where the students love more the teacher than poetry. In prep school, I will never forget my math teacher who was a tyrant, she made me so nervous I felt I would nauseate sometimes. But ultimately, I remember her as one of the greatest teachers I ever had. ""Dead Poets Society"" starts with the wrong step by showing a professor already popular, when the greatest achievement is to go against the naturally pointless rebellious attitude of student. Teach them the passion for learning not the learning of passion.<br/><br/>Besides, some of the greatest artistic uvres were made during oppressive times, that let the very best of human soul translate its angst, its passion in an explosion of creativity ... and one must experience prison to dream of escape."
"moviesleuth2","9","1","2","22 April 2010"," Extraordinary
","Inspirational films run the risk of being boring and preachy, but ""Dead Poet's Society,"" an under-appreciated near-masterpiece, is neither. A great script, superb performances and excellent direction make ""Dead Poet's Society"" a truly amazing film.<br/><br/>The film takes place at Welton Academy, a prestigious boarding school for boys that prides itself on tradition. Enter John Keating (Robin Williams), a passionate poetry teacher who encourages his students to ""make their lives extraordinary."" With his unconventional teaching methods, Keating inspires his students to break out of the molds that their school is putting them into, and become individualsfor better or worse.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is nothing short of incredible. Robin Williams gives his best performance as Keating. Williams was born to play this role, plain and simple. He plays the role with so much passion that it is impossible not to become inspired ourselves. If every teacher were as good as John Keating, then I would have become a Nobel Prize winner by the time I reached college. Although this is not a comedy, the role does give Williams the chance to earn a few grins and chuckles (watch for the scene where he talks about Shakespeare). The young actors who play the students are no less compelling. Robert Sean Leonard is terrific as Neil Perry, a young man with his future already planned out for him by his domineering father. But Keating gives him the chance to break out and discover who he really is, but the threat of his father's anger always clouds over him. Leonard ably portrays the sense of a young man trapped in a life that he begins to realize is not what he wants. Leonard should have received at least some recognition for his performance. Ethan Hawke is also very good as the incredibly shy new student, Todd Anderson. Everyone knows a kid like Todd, who is so insecure that he has trouble speaking up in class. Hawke is so good that we can't help but feel for the guy. Josh Charles and Gale Hansen are quite funny as Knox, the guy who is lovelorn for a girl at the local public school, and Charlie, the rich troublemaker.<br/><br/>However, there is an actor that is often overlooked, and that's a shame. Kurtwood Smith is outstanding as Neil's father. The talented character actor is actually rather frightening as the overbearing father. Yet Smith never lets the character become a ""villain,"" so to speak. He wants what's best for his son, and he gave everything to get Neil into Welton, but he can't understand that Neil may not want the life that is set out for him. Smith should have gotten an Oscar for his performance, though he was not nominated.<br/><br/>Peter Weir has established the perfect tone for the film. It's not the witty comedy that the trailers make it out to be (although there are some funny moments, including a hilarious scene involving a telephone), nor is it a manipulative tearjerker. This is a character exploration about a few young men who are breaking out of the norm and learning what life is really about, and who they really are. However, Weir makes one blunder, and it's a big one. The film's climax is superbly constructed (the sense of foreboding is quite potent and disturbing), but when the big moment comes, he makes a huge mistake by using slow-motion. It only lasts a few seconds, but it's so over-the-top that it shatters everything that the previous few minutes have built up. The film recovers as soon as the clip is over, however, primarily because our character identification is so strong.<br/><br/>This is a truly amazing film, and I cannot express that enough. I love this movie with all my heart."

The story is set in a renowned boys-only preparatory school called Welton Academy, which is traditional, austerre and where the students are expected to be the best.

","This has to be one of my favorite movies ever. I think that it is the most classic example of an English Major movie. Robin Williams is phenomenal in this movie. He portrays the quintessential English teacher, quirky and eccentric. His character Mr. Keating, is one of those teachers who everyone loves, he's the teacher that you go to with anything, even if you don't' have him for a class. As an English Major I feel that this movie helps to show the beauty and the wonder that is English literature. The way that it is presented just seems to open the world of literature into mainstream. It invites people to go read Byron, Shelley, and Wordsworth. For me, it makes people want to read the classics, it is one of the things in this world that I think helps me to remember why, when I'm down having to read and dissect obscure literature, I chose to be an English major. It helps you to as Keating says ""think for your self"". Its a movie for everyone despite what I've said, because you take the message and it translates into anything, ""think for your self"". If I had to say anything about that I would say it was the moral of the story. Its helping to show people that they don't' have to be sheep, that they can think with out following the paved road. Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, for me this movie represents everything that I, as an English Major want to help show the world."

","I am still in high school and we just finished this movie this past week. Unbelievable is one word that describes this movie. The writing is great and the acting is equally astounding but the message lies no lower on the scale. To know what a materialistic and judgmental society we live in, this is such an important message to tell. I recommend this highly for any high school student. In one of the essays that I recently wrote I began it like this: ""We are hypocrites in our own nature. We tell our children to be themselves and not to give into peer pressure. We tell them to make a caricature of themselves and emphasize and celebrate what makes them different. All the while, we let society judge who we are and where we stand. We let it compare us to its definition of the ""perfect"" human being and define us. "" I wrote that before I saw the movie and while I was watching, I kept thinking of my last essay.

","Someone needs to attend private school again and see that students don't tend to group in bunches of 6 or 7 and be best buddies, especially males in the late 50's. This is America- an individualistic society not collectivist. It's somebody's wish that never came true except on film. It was a little overpowering to see these students scamper around everywhere except the boy who visits the local high school to get the girl of his dreams. They act like a bunch of girls trying to get ahold of every nitty gritty detail and the kid is even eager to tell. Yeah right. The message is okay-carpe diem- but can be taken to the extreme as the Teacher K warns. I would like to have the teacher's lesson plans. How did he break the mold and allowed to teach there in the first place with the ancient administration still in power? By the way Neil's choice was dumb. He couldn't have been their child anyway with dark brown eyes and his parents both blue. Just a minor detail. Anyway he could have ran away but not end it that way. I rated this 6 since it had nice scenery, some kids who care more about poetry than wild parties, and a teacher who tried to change the stodgy system."

","There have been many excellent movies dealing with the theme of teacher/ student interaction: 'To Sir With Love', 'Children of a Lesser God', 'Educating Rita', etc. In most cases the plot revolves around the teacher using special methods to reach students in difficult learning situations, or the teacher becomes a role model or inspiration for the student, or perhaps both, as is the case in 'Dead Poet's Society'.<br/><br/>And I suppose we can all think back to a special teacher who helped us at school, who put in that extra effort to forge a personal connection, and who really seemed to care. Maybe it was an English teacher who introduced us to a special poet or poem? Perhaps a film like this helps us remember these things about our own past, and that is part of the movie's appeal.<br/><br/>'Dead Poet's Society' is about a gifted teacher (played by the inimitable Robin Williams) and a special student, the connection they had, and the disastrous consequences which resulted. It's a uplifting film, a poignant film, a film that touches the heart.<br/><br/>'Dead Poet's Society' was directed by Australian-born Peter Weir who more recently directed 'The Truman Show' and 'Master and Commander'."

The way these students were treated was so absurd. I don't know how any student could learn.

"stephenz","10","1","2","4 April 2004"," This Movie Changed My Life
","Okay, so that's a pretty big statement, but out of all the films I've seen in my life, this film is one that I can point to changing it.  Some of it must have had to do when I saw it, teenager, and the typical teenager things I was going through.<br/><br/>For one, I started writing and reading poetry.  If that isn't enough of a change I became a literature major in College.  This film gave me courage to do crazy things, to step out of my shell and to actually ask girls out instead of thinking about them all the time.  It affected my view of art, and that it's okay to be an artist and still be male.<br/><br/>I think it is an excellent coming of age film for boys, it goes through so many of the emotions rattling around inside during that time.  The joy, uncertainty, pressure to fit in, attraction, betrayal, wanting love from a parent but never getting it and on and on.<br/><br/>I've seen this film enough times to see the flaws but I love every minute of it, flaws and all. There is so much subtly in the film that goes unnoticed.<br/><br/>When Keating tells the boys to rip the page out of a book, the Judas of the group uses a ruler to rip the page out but leaving a thin strip of the page in the book.  A metaphor for when he betrays the others.<br/><br/>After reading some of the comments on this site, specifically the ones that pointed out why none of the beat poets were in the film, I came to the conclusion that it is interesting that the poetry studied in this film is full of structure.  All the poems read were written in a strict poetical form, with the exception of Wadsworth.  Structure is not devoid of beauty, just as chaos is not devoid of patterns.  More often than not, it is structure that allows beauty to bloom.  And although Keating was encouraging the boys to break out of the mold, to think for themselves, at one point when Neuwanda places a phone call to God in a school gathering, he cautions the boys to suck the marrow out of life, just don't choke on the bone.<br/><br/>I don't think the purpose of the film is that all structure is evil, but instead to find your passion, whatever it is.  There can be beauty and passion in crunching numbers as much as painting starry nights."

Very deep, emotional, and powerful movie with amazing, wonderful acting.  There are boys in a boarding school, not all of whom really want to be there, and they all have emotions dreams that need to be released and lived out. Most of them have been taught and controlled to listen to their parents and follow strict rules of conformity all of their lives.  A new English teacher comes to their school with a different way of teaching, trying to push the boys past conformity to feel their personal passion and live out their dreams, in order to express themselves and make a difference in life. There are many other people in the boys' lives (teachers, parents, etc.) that do not agree with what the teacher suggests and teaches to the boys.

","My Rating: *** out of ****. <br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is a good film but it was swept up by the academy. This is one of those times where the academy nominates something that is undeserving. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four academy awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Robin Williams), and Best Original Screenplay. Out of those four, one of them may have been deserving.<br/><br/>
The acting is solid throughout the film. Robin Williams gives a solid, convincing performance as John Keating. Yet, even know he is good here he did not deserve a nomination for Best Actor. For one thing, the performance is nothing amazing and he actually does not have a whole lot of screentime.<br/><br/>
The best acting comes from the supporting players, who are the kids in the school. The best performance comes from Ethan Hawke. He gives an excellent portrayal as a shy, unassured teenager. The rest of the acting from the teenagers is all solid. <br/><br/>The Dead Poet Society is always interesting and entertaining but it never striked me as brilliant. Its a well written movie and it has its share of good moments but never really rises above. The movie does look great visually. The Cinematography is excellent. A Peter Weir movie (the director) always looks great. <br/><br/>However, the Dead Poets Sociey has flaws. Was it ever really necessary to have a subplot about them going into the Dead Poets Society? That subplot seemed really pointless. Also, there was a scene when one of the kids commits suicide. The music seemed somewhat pretentious during this moment. As did some of the shots. Why did the camera focus on the Dads slippers then? Whats the significance? Peter Weir has been accused of being pretentious at times and that whole moment seemed pretentious. Peter Weir has done better (Witness, Master and Commander).<br/><br/>Even with its flaws, I still liked Dead Poets Society. It was overrated by the academy but that does not make it a bad movie. Its a good film, its just not great."

If you liked 'Remember the Titans' and 'Braveheart', you'll love this.  They are shallow perceptions of disturbing themes. Mortality, humanity, family, and sex are all explored, none to the fullest.<br/><br/>So, when we have emotion for emotion's sake, we are bored and left unresolved with questions left to be answered.  In the end, it's a 50s sitcom with the homily at the end to please everyone.  Perhaps it's from these reasons why Williams is so powerful.  I love the scene of him instructing the students to rip the pages out of their books.  It's the only impression this film left with me, tearing out pages.  Rebelling against the idea that the abstract is containable or even gradable.<br/><br/>Overall, mediocre at best, sentimental at worst.  2.5 out of 5."

I would say it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but then again I'd be hard put to say what is. Suffice to say it's well worth whatever time is spent in the viewing. A few niggling things about it, however...I find it hard to imagine such an obvious iconoclast as Keating being hired at this school, given the pains taken with its stodgy identity, and Neil's character showed a remarkable weakness for a putative leader of an 'offbeat' group. His father, as well, was so one dimensional as to strain belief; why would he object so strenuously to his son's acting, if (as stated) it didn't affect his other schoolwork? And Knox's silly little love affair...why was this given so much play? Finally, Neil's ultimate solution to his problem was, well, not too credible, for a teenager with his entire life ahead of him. On the plus side, there's the emergence of Tod from his sheltered cocoon, and his rallying the boys for one last (albeit empty)defense of their mentor...a scene which I found gut wrenching. Some have commented on the boys' timidity in not standing up for Keating earlier, but the film made clear the futility of that, given the power of the parents/administration vis a vis a group of idealistic youths. For what it's worth, I urge anyone who hasn't seen this movie to do so, and to prepare to be moved, regardless of the cynic within you..."

The dean took him into his office and literally gave him a paddling on the butt.  Don't you think college students are a little old to be treated like that?  Besides, wasn't that unlawful or had no laws about that yet been passed in the 50's?  Watching this movie also taught me one thing.  It was a famous word (actually two) called ""Carpe Diem.""  I had heard of that little phrase for several years.  Now I finally knew what it meant, ""seize the day.""  A similar incident was used in the movie ""Mrs. Doubtfire.""

But in ""Dead Poets Society"", he masterfully combines his genious comedy-talent with his more serious side of acting and it's a winning combination. <br/><br/>Peter Weir's directing is awesome, and the combination of a great story, excellent acting from all actors involved, solid camerawork and both humour and drama, makes this one of my all time highs!"

After spending an indeterminable amount of time in the local Blockbuster, the mother had selected Terms of Endearment.  The daughter, wanting something lighter, and nursing a serious crush on Robert Sean Leonard, chose a Robin Williams movie called Dead Poets Society, assuming it was a comedy.  That was the best mistake of my life.  I went through a box and a half of kleenex from Neil's suicide on.  Here is what this film taught me: 1)  If all you think of from when you wake up in the morning to when you go to sleep at night is a profession, a talent, or an idea, that's what you are meant to do. 2)  There is nothing wrong with being smart. 3)  Each of us is given a brief time on this earth, and we must make the most of it. 4)  You have to learn to think for yourself. 5)  ""No matter what anyone tells you, words and ideas can change the world."" I'm not such a little girl anymore and I am preparing to leave in a year for college.  This video will go with me.  When ever I feel like giving up, like scraping it all to be normal, I watch this film.  I only hope, as I prepare to become a teacher, I can inspire my students to make their lives extraordinary.  Sincerely,  Rebecca"

","Dead Poets Society is the best movie I have ever seen. I never get bored to it, I have seen it already 8 times. My husband bought me it as DVD for Christmas present, that I would not break the VCR (by playing my old VHS-tape again and again).<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is absolutely fantastic. Same time touching, sad, funny and fair story about boys, who live in an old, traditional boarding school. A story, how parents are trying to influence for children´s decisions about their career.<br/><br/>For my opinion, Robin Williams and Ethan Hawke played here the best roles of their career."

","While I love movies of all shapes and sizes, there are a few movies that stand out among the rest.  Dead Poets Society is one such movie.  It doesn't hurt that Robin Williams is one of my favorite performers, either.  This film came out during the summer before my first year at Indiana University and gave me some much needed confidence and inspiration as I started a new chapter in my life.  I still go back to this film when I'm feeling a little down or if I need a kick in the pants.  All in all, if you have not seen this film yet - please rent it (or buy it) - and soak up the wonderful story."

Anyway I digress... the kids believe every word of it without argument and the plot never really went anywhere, the kids were neither rebellious nor transformed in their attitudes by poetry.

","This movie is so convinced that its message is so wonderful and revolutionary when it is actually pretty ordinary, for 1989 or even 1959. And it spends very little time trying to prove its point. After two very short scenes with professor Keating, already the students are completely turned around to his way of thinking (which despite what anyone may claim is not the same thing as thinking for themselves). I did not believe this for one second.<br/><br/>Real life cannot be summed up in two Latin words. And poetry is one of the many wonderful ways we have that show us how complex and contradictory life can be. But none of the poems that are mentioned in this film are examined with any depth. They are simply plundered for simple-minded slogans, and the scenes of the reconstituted titular society are completely devoid of interest.<br/><br/>To quote Roger Ebert, Â«Â at the end of a great teacher's course in poetry, the students would love poetry; at the end of this teacher's semester, all they really love is the teacher.Â Â» When one of Keating's students commits suicide for reasons of plot convenience rather than character sense, Keating is asked to leave, a decision which I would find perfectly sound under the circumstances, but is treated by this film as a gross injustice.<br/><br/>If there's one aspect of this film that deserves praise, it's the acting. Williams gives a terrifically restrained performance (save the one scene where he reverts to his nightclub persona by impersonating various actors) and the adolescents also do their best with the shoddy material.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

","Smart and popular Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) has a domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) who controls his son. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) is his new shy roommate in the high class Welton Academy boarding school. John Keating (Robin Williams) is their new English teacher who teaches his students all about living life to the fullest... Carpe Diem. Neil finds an old senior annual where Keating was a part of the Dead Poets Society. The boys decide to resurrect the Society.<br/><br/>The young cast is pretty good led by the quiet Ethan Hawke and a good leading man in RSL. Of course, the teacher in these types of movies is what sells it. Robin Williams controls his wilder instincts to create a very compelling character. It's a little too much poetry for me, but I like the movie otherwise especially the performances."

","I like poetry. I like Robin Williams. I like Peter Weir. I like Maurice Jarre. So, I had high hopes for this movie and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. It seems in almost every dramatic or semi-dramatic film that Robin Williams stars in, he plays a victim. I kept waiting for him to be picked on and it sure came. John Seating is a new teacher at a very strict school called Welton. His styles and teaching methods are not what the students are used to and his love for poetry inspires them to reopen an old school club called the Dead Poets Society. At this point, the movie falls downhill. I think the problem is the characters. The director tries to make us love and connect with them, oh how hard he tries. But, oh how much I didn't care by the end. We needed to know more about John Seating's personal life and not just his job. Besides a few good themes scattered throughout, there is not a lot to gain by watching this film."

","This film can be summed up in three words, ""An unfinished masterpiece"". All the components for a truly great film are there, but the ending simply doesn't do it justice, there are far too many loose ends to think about. There was also the fact that Robin Williams' character only appeared to touch the lives of a few yet, others stood up in his defence at the end of the film. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I walked away believing that I should too ""seize the day"" but the story was too poorly finished to refrain me from thinking of anything else by the end. The ending was iconic but bad, but I don't know how they could have ended it to finish off all of the individual characters different stories. Loved the film but it needed about another half an hour to at least attempt to finish off its own story, but a valiant effort to the ""unfinished masterpiece"""

They're written so one-dimensionally Weir should have dressed them in all black and given them big Simon Legree mustaches to twirl. ""How dare you act in a play!

This film may have tried, but it just really didn't do much for this particular viewer. The plot is good, and the story is one that should be told. The way it's told here works OK, but the film never grabbed me. I never stopped watching or particularly felt like it... the film isn't bad, just somewhat bland. The acting ranges, but is rarely magnificent. The cast has a nice hand-full of people who have done better, given much more convincing performances. The writing ranges. There are a few scenes that work well, maybe even one or two that are downright memorable and good, but then there are the(admittedly only few) underdeveloped sub-plots, and scenes that just don't come off as dramatic as it seems like they were meant to. There are a few technical issues; the editing is at times strange, cutting away or on to the next shot too soon or too late. The cinematography mostly at least works, but there are a few shots that are oddly framed. In the end, this is a decent enough film, it just seems like it could have been considerably better, given the people in front of and behind the cameras(Weir went on to direct The Truman Show). I recommend it to fans of the people involved in making it as well as anyone the plot appeals to. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. 6/10"

","Robin Williams' finest role is this wonderful movie that I have watched maybe a zillion times and will never grow tired of.<br/><br/>A simple story of a teacher who comes into the lives of young students at a boys' preparatory school and ""shakes things up"", this movie has been copied dozens of times since its release, and never quite as well. Robin Williams, as poetry teacher John Keating, tries to get the boys to think beyond algebra and chemistry and their acceptance to Harvard, and to start thinking for themselves. He urges them to ""seize the day"" and take control of their lives. And in changing the way his students think, he also had a profound effect on me... and I suspect, on the life of anyone else fortunate enough to see this film.<br/><br/>At once criticized for being a clichÃ© and hailed as an instant classic, Dead Poets Society is both... and neither. It is simply a film that makes you think, question, hope and dare to dream. I think most of us either knew someone who affected us in a similar way as teenagers, or wish we did. Yes, the movie is full of exaggerated clichÃ©s - but whose life isn't at that age? And yes, the movie has also achieved a sort of new classic status. Hopefully, the superlatives won't kill the essence that is this film.<br/><br/>I've seen this compared to a lot of movies - mostly inferior ones made since, such as The Emperor's Club - but the best comparison I could come up with is to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Not for content, but for the underlying message... and consequently, for the movie's effect on people. Specifically, on me.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, you're sorely missing out."

","Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society is film about one English professor teaching his class a very important life lesson. Robin Williams stars as Professor John Keating along with Robert Sean Leonard as Neil Perry and Ethan Hawke as Todd Anderson. Keating, an English professor at Welton Academy, the 'best prep school in America,' inspires his students to make their own decisions rather than letting someone else make them. He opens up his student's minds to the possibility that going against what is expected of them might be the only way to be all that they were intended to be. The Dead Poets Society, a group founded by Keating in the days of his youth to appreciate poetry is revived b the boys and further encourages them to follow their dreams.<br/><br/>'Carpe Diem, lads! Seize the Day! Make your lives extraordinary!'<br/><br/>Through these inspirational and wise words, the boys set out on their own battle to follow their dreams. Traditions and rules are broken and the boys enjoy many successes with their teacher. <br/><br/>Soon, these words have come back to haunt Keating as the suicide of one of his students is blamed on him. Keating becomes the scapegoat and is forced to resign. The bond between Keating and the students is proved to be strong when they all literally stand up for what they feel right.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Yes, this is old stuff regurgitated out into new. Though the storyline is predictable and a bit cheesy, the rising actions towards the climax are realistically surprising. Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, and Ethan Hawke all put on amazing performances. The suicide scene, however, was painfully long and it would have been more impact full if it was a sudden burst of raw emotion instead of that pathetically long scene.<br/><br/>Take a 7/10."

"jimbo-53-186511","3","1","4","2 April 2018"," There are powerful moments towards the end, but other than that I found it surprisingly empty and boring
","English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) has a rather unorthodox approach to teaching (which raises a few eyebrows in the early stages). Worse is to follow when a group of students find Keating's book and learn about his involvement in The Dead Poets Society (essentially Keating and his fellow students going against the grain). When Keating divulges what The Dead Poets Society is all about the students are intrigued and decide to form their own Dead Poets Society, but will all of this come at a cost?<br/><br/>I hadn't seen Dead Poets Society before but wanted to give it a chance due to its high rating and because it starred Robin Williams (an actor who can be brilliant when given the right material). What really surprised me about this film is how empty and boring it felt to me for the majority of its running time.<br/><br/>I think the major problem I had with this film is that there was nothing really driving the narrative forward; if you look at films like To Sir With Love and Dangerous Minds they focus on students who are initially rebellious and end up being won over by a teacher and their unorthodox teaching methods which means that there is something there to move the story along i.e character shifts and character progression. In Dead Poets Society you don't really get any of that; the kids here seem far too accepting of Keating and his quirky and unorthodox teaching methods which doesn't give the film much of a sense of realism and doesn't make a lot of the classroom scenes all that involving.<br/><br/>Even coming away from the classroom the film still failed to make any kind of impression on me; the kids form a Dead Poets Society and read poetry to one another in some kind of alcove, but I didn't get much out of any of this I'm afraid; no major insights from the characters and no real interesting dialogue. Despite there being a good number of students only 2 of them are given any real development; Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) who bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Jim Carrey here and Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles). The former with his overbearing father dictating how he should live his life and the latter with his obsession with a cheerleader who is dating a jock. Both are coming-of-age story arcs, but the latter is rather trite and uninteresting whereas the former is a more interesting thread albeit a tad clichÃ©d in all honesty. Whilst neither of these story arcs are brilliant, they do at least provide the film with some much needed character development and momentum.<br/><br/>Still having said all that the film isn't all bad; the cast are likeable enough (the film boasts an early appearance from a very young Ethan Hawke). Robin Williams is always a welcome presence in any film and does a solid enough job here (although I must confess that I think he has been better in several other films). There are some powerful moments towards the end of the film and the final scene shown in the film is iconic and memorable.<br/><br/>However, for me, Dead Poets Society, for the most part was rather dull and uninvolving - I also found it rather repetitive which also added to the tedium. For me, there were simply too many negatives and not nearly enough positives."

","From Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Peter Weir (Witness, The Truman Show), this may be a very good coming-of-age period drama. Basically Todd Anderson (young Ethan Hawke) is one of the new students to attend the new semester at Welton Academy for boys, along with Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) - always under pressure by his father Mr. Perry (Kurtwood Smith), Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero) and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston). All classes appear boring and not to the boys interests, and then they have their first English class with replacement teacher John Keating (Robin Williams), and they all bond with him and his unusual teaching methods. As they get to know Keating, or ""Oh Captain, My Captain"", they also come across his old year book, with mention of a club called the ""Dead Poets Society"", a hang out for student boys to read and write poems to each other, and they decide to restart it in the same cave. As well as their ""learning"" of English (poetry), Dalton causes trouble with a letter to the Headmaster saying that girls should attend, Knox tries his luck with local girl Chris Noel (Alexandra Powers), and Perry has the ambition to be an actor. After starring as the lead in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Perry's father is still controlling, and he decides to make him leave the school for military academy, this is when Neil can't stand it, and commits suicide. In the end, Keating is told to leave the school on the grounds of encouraging the boys, and possibly having some involvement of Niel's suicide, and the final scene, which was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, has all his students stand on their desk shouting ""Oh Captain, My Captain"" in support. Also starring Norman Lloyd as Mr. Nolan and Carla Belver as Mrs. Perry. Williams is a wonderful teacher character, teaching the boys to be free thinkers, and stand up for what they want, it is no wonder he received an Oscar nomination. All the young boys have their moments too, with some funny moments from Williams (especially with impressions, like Marlon Brando and John Wayne), it is a very warm and touching film. It won the Oscar for Won Oscar Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Original Film Score for Maurice Jarre, and it was nominated for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 95 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Carpe diem. Seize the days, boys.

","First off Robin Williams was outstanding lighting up every scene he appears in with his charisma and sincerity but sadly he isn't in the film nearly enough the bulk of screen time going to a group of teenage students who while fairly interesting characters represented by good actors weren't able to hold my attention.
Now the chief issue with Dead Poets Society is that the message of the film seems to be non conformism, thinking for yourself and being an individual the final 3rd seems to tell us that going down that route is a road that will deliver nothing but failure and rejection.
Our hero Robin Williams is fired, one of the boys commits suicide and the fraternal club of non conformists known as The Dead Poets Society are crushed and disbanded by the school hierarchy because they dare to non conform.
Sure there's that happy clappy final scene tacked on at the end but just a little thought would suggest that the boys who escaped expulsion earlier by becoming rats would almost certainly have been expelled for what they did in that final scene.
So the supposedly positive message of the movie that of Carpe Diem is rendered meangingless by the ACTUAL message of the film that being in the end the man always wins."

","Dead Poets Society is a film that is intended to inspire, provoke thought, and bring a combination of humor and drama to the audience while pushing a non-conformist ideology at the core of the story. it tells the story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.
Robin Williams gives one of his most convincing and restrained film performances to date by effectively muting his compulsion to jump from one shtick to another and playing a single character instead of his usual compilation of personalities. While his screen time is actually quite limited, he does a credible job at making the viewer believe that he is the unconventional teacher who motivates the students to actually think for themselves rather than have their knowledge, beliefs, and personal philosophies spoon-fed to them via textbooks and professorial rhetoric. One of Williams' most endearing personality traits, overwhelming compassion, is found in this character beneath the anarchistic persona that is Robin Williams the entertainer.
The Dead Poets Society is an exquisite episode with a wonderful cast and an attractive and persuasive story from beginning to end. The movie was run by Robin Williams who was nominated for Oscar. The Dead Poets Association is one of the rare movies that tell the story with a wonderful script. This is the most exciting movie by director Peter Weil, which uses a simple element to tell an unforgettable story. The direction of the weir is incredible, and he communicates something truly unique here.
Like most movies, after all, we did not see many dead poets. We announced that various discs of the Dead Poets Society have a glimpse of the material, never finished the final editing of the movie. In other scenes, it is difficult to decide to delete it with Weir. For example, when discovering Neil 's body, the first plan was to block suicide accumulation and outcomes through a happy and instant meeting of the Death Poets' Association."

","After hearing the overwhelmingly positive reviews about this film, I definitely had to check it out. It had been on my watch list for quite a while and when I got the time to watch it, there was something missing.<br/><br/>My no means is that an awful film, in fact in some aspects the film is great and inspiring but the overall message of the film became muddled as the story progressed to the point that it wasn't quite clear what the actual message was or why any attention should be paid to it.<br/><br/>While I don't disagree with the idea that poetry and literature should be free spirited, I think it's still necessary to place boundaries even though it could be argued that the purpose of this film was about removing boundaries. The original idea was about creating poetry through passion and thinking freely which is a good message however the way it was implemented made it feel weak. It's clear that there was a good idea but it just felt like it lacked when it came to the execution of the idea.<br/><br/>The main issue I have is that this film focused too much on trying to be a drama and create dramatic and emotional moments and not enough on creating a good story.<br/><br/>So a student killed himself because he was not allowed to become an actor, what message did that show? It's certainly not one of optimism or chasing your hopes and dreams which it could have been, it isn't about standing up for what you believe or standing your ground and refusing to move even when the whole world is trying to move you. It's a message of despair. Creating a meaningful exchange with the father was possible but it didn't happen and therefore, the message we get from this is not one which says chase your dreams.<br/><br/>
I thought the ending was pretty abrupt and it just ends... There's no conclusion or happy ending even though a happy ending isn't necessary, there's actually no ending. It left you waiting for something which did not happen.<br/><br/>The movie definitely had a number of very good aspects but they weren't broad together well. The theme and plot acts as the glue and by sticking on the various ideas and sub plots, you create a good film. The glue was very weak and this resulted in a poor film overall.<br/><br/>I think the film tried too hard to be deep and this ended up making it less than what it could have been."

"audrablum","10","0","1","17 February 2018"," Brilliantly Ironic Poetic Film
","This week I chose to watch a dramedy called Dead Poets Society (1989). The logline reads ""English teacher John Keating inspires his students to look at poetry with a different perspective of authentic knowledge and feelings."" The movie made me feel inspired as an artist. At its core the story embraces Shakespeare's line ""to thine own self be true."" In this story John Keating, the new English teacher exercises unconventional methods to help the students grasps their individual senses of artistic freedom and the importance of not being governed by others rather embracing one's own identity and desires. Through a series of ups and downs the students have to come to terms with the depths of what that means. The story made me think about how important it is for people to be accepting of one another, especially for parents to accept their children no matter how different they are. The movie also reminded me that each person just might define success differently. A parent may see success in career and financial status whereas a son may see success as penniless but enjoying his or her career. 
 I think the story writing here was brilliant. The ideas were strongly conveyed through the dialogue script and even paid tribute to its poetic theme by using such things as irony, foil, and foreshadowing techniques. The acting was great too. Obviously Robin Williams stole the show, but he younger men were quite talented. The directing was great and mostly felt seamless. The pacing seemed a little slow to me at some points, and some of the cave scenes reminded me of The Breakfast Club (1985). The movie was made by Touchstone Pictures so of course it was professional quality. I liked the use of lighting and there were definite moments of contrast where the lighting was used to highlight the inner ""dark thoughts"" in certain moments. Overall, I loved the film and wish I would have seen it sooner."

","From a narrative standpoint, Robin Williams isn't the focus of ""Dead Poets Society"", but he does steal the movie; and his costars are no weaklings either, so that's saying something. But this is a story that rails against conformity and academic establishment, and as such, he is well-suited as agitator-in-chief.<br/><br/>I love this movie, from its classical sensibilities to its autumn atmosphere (the photography is stunning). There's a genuine sense of youth here, and the pressures of parental expectation on these men is still relatable (and I've never been apart of that culture); enough so that a troublemaker like Robin Williams feels downright heroic.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that just makes your heart swell. And even when it turns to tragedy, the move is organic.<br/><br/>There's warmth all over this thing.<br/><br/>9/10"
"cccccheck","5","0","2","18 November 2016"," Why the hype?
","I've got to say, I usually love films like this. Some of the themes in this film had some seriously potential. But I've come away from the film pretty disappointed.<br/><br/>One of the failures of the film is there is no main character. We follow the lives of the prep-school boys (which are interesting) but there is no one who viewers were led to particularly invest in. It's clear that Neil is pretty important but there's not enough eye-in to his inner self for viewers to make a significant investment. <br/><br/>Secondly, the boys at the prep school were doe-eyed with Mr Keating. Yes, some teenagers are very impressionable, but these teenagers were so quickly and wholeheartedly captured by Mr Keating that it is too much for belief. Where was the initial scepticism that required convincing to overcome? <br/><br/>Additionally, throughout the film viewers are led to believe Mr Keating is doing something of value for his students – significant value. But honestly, what was it? I am sitting here reflecting on his lessons and wondering what their true value was. What did he do that was so important that made him the ""teacher-hero""? I know that he was encouraging ""free-thinking"", but his lessons, truly, didn't clearly express that. Therefore, his ""revolutionary"" behaviour does not seem to me to be that revolutionary.<br/><br/>Also, if his teaching was so unique and impacting, why was it that essentially none of the boys actually chose to reject conformity? They all signed the paper, wrongly assigning guilt to Mr Keating. Yes, the students stood on their desks in the end as a sign of loyalty to Mr Keating, but, ultimately, what value did that act have? None. Sure, Mr Keating got some warm fuzzy feelings, but he still lost his job.<br/><br/>Lastly – and this relates to my first point – the suicide came as a shock. It just left me asking ""Why?"" The significance of Neil's inner turmoil and Mr Keating's teaching to Neil are quite unclear. So the death of Neil seemed like a nice emotive curveball to make viewers feel like Mr Keating truly was doing something meaningful. Or that parents should listen to their kids? Again, what was the message here? And, as discussed earlier, Mr Keating's purpose does not seem truly remarkable. <br/><br/>Yes, this film has a lot going for it, but it really needed to do a few things better. 1. Let viewers get to know Neil more. 2. Make the students more believable. 3. Make Mr Keating's purpose clear and remarkable."

","Dead Poets' Society is by far one of the best movies I have ever witnessed in my 17 years of life. No movie has more impacted my life on a daily basis as this one has. The reflection on what society expects of us that is consistent throughout the entire movie is intriguing and presented in a likable way. This extravagant movie is filled with quotes you will hold onto for a lifetime, helping you to cope with the distressing situations that life will bring. Each character's plot line speaks about another type of existence, proving that we all have our own individual lives. Each person's plot is an extension of the theme that life is more than a career. Each person's hope and dreams are hindered by society and its demands on the individual. An outlet for this stress is the Dead Poets' Society, which is a collective group of boys in the private school. They write poetry and songs, sharing with one another. They express the demands on them as teenagers in this world: ""Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling, Gotta do more, gotta be more. Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming, Gotta be more, gotta do more."" This along with several other lines is what intrigues me most about this movie. The poetry is written so artfully to fit its message, and succeeds wonderfully in this outstanding movie."

I haven't seen it in years and I'm not sure it would hold up that well. The other four are quite mediocre, with one of the most mediocre winners of all time, Driving Miss Daisy. If you can extrapolate the general IMDb voter's opinion, Dead Poets Society should have won. It's the highest rated of the five, and has about 140,000 more votes than the next most voted on title. That's pretty amazing, really. I don't get it, frankly. Dead Poets Society to me was probably the worst of the five, just complete sludge. The film is about a group of rich white boys at a boarding school who become enamored of their free-spirited teacher, Robin Williams, who teaches them to ""carpe diem,"" or ""sieze the day."" The boys (who include Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) form the Dead Poets Society, where they meet at night in a cave to read poetry. This is, for no reason in particular, highly looked down upon. And woe unto you if you ever want to act in a Shakespeare play, as Leonard eventually does. His father, Kurtwood Smith, does not approve of such frivolities. The final act of this film is pretty ridiculous, with Robin Williams incurring blame for something that clearly had nothing to do with him. The ending, which is supposed to be uplifting, just feels extremely unsatisfying. The performances are actually quite fine. Williams certainly didn't deserve a Best Actor nomination, though. This is clearly category fraud. There is no clear lead, but both Leonard and Hawke probably have more screen time than Williams, who seems like he's barely in the film for it being such a well loved performance."
"StevePulaski","8","0","1","16 December 2013"," The good and the bad fight to create a mixed bag
","I can look at Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society from two different lenses and come to two different conclusions based on them. The first lens sees a mawkish production, one looking to inflate its emotional climax by ways of theatrics and erect a film largely founded off of vague characters, common clichés, and quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets. I'd assign that film two stars. However, my opposite view sees the film as a production tackling themes of self-discovery and enrichment along with aspirations over obligations, utilizing quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets to its advantage. I'd assign that film four stars. The issue is I can't see one lens at a time, without the other covering it, as everything I've stated exists in this film to some degree. I'm compromising at three stars and going from there.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero), and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston), high school seniors at the prestigious prep school Welton Academy, a school boasting the typical prep school philosophy of honor, excellence, and education. It is looking to be another year of mundane lameness for the boys until they meet their English literature teacher, Mr. John Keating (Robin Williams), who preaches the philosophy of ""carpe diem"" and informs them that they may refer to him as ""O captain! My captain!"" Immediately, he touches these students in a way they've never been touched before. The class that was once a bore to them has now become an outlet for expression and personal enrichment, along with providing them with personal benefits they had never seen. The seven teens decide to secretly revive the ""Dead Poets Society,"" a club that was erected to study and preserve the teachings and the beauty of poetry written by poets who have passed away. Keating was a member of the society when he attended Welton Academy and loved it, so naturally the boys want to have a similar experience.<br/><br/>When the boys create the society, the first thing I sort of cringed at was the way they acted. It was as if they felt they were making a difference to society in general rather than simply learning something in an institution that predicates itself off of learning in the first place. Then it hit me; that's exactly what they were doing. The beauty of Dead Poets Society is that these teenagers are actually learning and feeling like they're becoming better (or at least different) people because of it. Weir and writer Tom Schulman are specifically trying to detail the dramatic shift in thinking the boys are experiencing in school. It succeeds because we can see the difference in their actions and their way of looking at the world because of it. Consider when Todd runs outside after hearing tragic news to only stop and look at the snow falling and blanketing the grass below. ""It's beautiful,"" he says, before falling to his knees. Without Mr. Keating, he would've fallen to his knees.<br/><br/>However, I will say that by the end of the film, Keating is left too much of an enigma. He is all too clearly a metaphor of a captain, leading his shipmates (the teenagers) to a destination much different than what they intended. That destination is unclear, but the journey provides for a change of scenery for the boys. Robin Williams gives a great performance, but he's playing a character that is all too clearly supposed to be analyzed rather than resonated with.<br/><br/>All the teenagers do exceptional acting, especially Robert Sean Leonard as Neil, whose father (Kurtwood Smith) pressures him to no end to become a doctor or anything but what his passion wants, which is to be an actor. This is where I come back and explore another theme of the film, this time one that's rarely touched on. With all the coming-of-age films, it's a bit difficult to find one that shows parents dictating their children's live in a way that is memorable. Smith's performance as a father who appears so stubborn and dictative over his son's actions he comes off as ignorant to his son's cries for a different life is a scarcely-mentioned one, but the themes at hand here kind of overshadow it. The film handles the idea in a way that's difficult to explain, but easy, if not relatable, to view.<br/><br/>But in addition, the mention of the film's use of theatrics and mawkishness come to mind once more. There is a tragedy that takes place in the film (attentive viewers, like myself, will see it coming long before it happens). When it does occur, the way the film handles it feels more like a way to attract tears than actual reality. The slow-motion effect doesn't help the film's case either. Everything after that scene, including the obligatory scene of appreciating the teacher's accomplishments that's tacked on at the end of the film, feels rushed.<br/><br/>As one can infer, I'm hot and cold with this film. As an aspiring English major and a person who loves to read and appreciate poetry, I appreciate the fact that this film - if shown to adolescents - can show them that reading and analyzing can be enjoyable if taken with seriousness and a willingness to learn. However, there are times when the film strays off its unconventional themes and focus in favor of a more sentimental portrayal of impact and motivation on students.<br/><br/>There's a truly amazing film in here, but due to the film's attitude of trying to embellish its emotional impact and leave our faces tear-stained, it's kind of deluded."

","""Dead Poets Society"" – A film that makes you think about your dreams and your decisions in life. Good or bad decisions<br/><br/>""Carpe Diem – Seize the day."" This statement is made by Mr. Keating, the special and unique teacher of ""Welton Academy"". After he had taught his students the sense of ""Carpe Diem"" and poetry, the way of thinking of many students changed and some of them started to finish what Mr. Keating had begun when he was at the same age.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film to watch it in class, you should have a look at ""Dead Poets Society"". It's a 1986 drama film which is directed by Peter Weir and is set at the ""Welton Academy"" in Vermont. It deals with the teacher Mr Keating who inspires his students with his special view of life and so they build a group called ""Dead Poets Society"". They meet each other at a cave near the school where they talk about poetry to express themselves.<br/><br/>The cave scenes are very amusing and show the boys in funny situations during the meetings. The ""new Dead Poets Society"" consists of quite different personalities: Neil Perry, the self-confident founder of the group, the shy Todd Anderson, the noisy Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, the clever one, Charlie Dalton and last but not least Knox Overstreet, a very friendly and polite student.<br/><br/>You may find it easy to identify with one of the young boys because of the interesting characters. They can surprise you in different ways and can also make you laugh. <br/><br/>If I was asked to rate this film on a scale from 0 – 10, I would give it 7 points as the film is easy to understand and all elements, which make life worth it like love, friendship or disagreement, are included.<br/><br/>It's a classic with a shocking and unexpected ending."

","Robin Williams gives his best performance since George Roy Hill's The World According to Garp film adaptation. This film is no parody of Irving's masterpiece but it is a parody nevertheless.

Williams is outstanding and is given a talented cast of young actors to work alongside.

","John Keating (Robin Williams) is the new English teacher at a public school in the USA. He has unorthodox teaching methods that inspire his pupils who then set up the ""Dead Poet's Society"", a society that Mr Keating was involved in when he was a student at the school. The idea is to meet up at night and recite poetry in order to free the mind and impress the ladies. We follow a handful of students as they try and do things their own way as inspired by Mr Keating but things go wrong.....<br/><br/>I was surprised that I enjoyed it. Robin Williams isn't his usual annoying self. In fact, it is Ethan Hawke who plays Todd that walks away with the most annoying character award. His character is very frustrating. There are a few unrealistic threads to the story, eg, a group of boys meeting up to read poetry at night - no way - boys sneak out to play football at night NOT to read poetry to each other. In real boarding schools, new kids are indoctrinated with humiliating rituals such as masturbating onto a piece of toast or a biscuit - they are not asked if they want to join a study group. But, then again, Americans are a different species. And no way would a pupil stand up in class and recite a poem about his love for a girl infront of his classmates just like a sissy! I also found that I didn't quite believe Neil's (Robert Sean Leonard) actions at the end of the film and as for the new boy, Todd, who knows his room-mate least out of everyone else, his reaction only makes sense if he is dealing with some gay issues. <br/><br/>However, there were some funny scenes and there were also some parts that make you think, eg, when the pupils are shown the pictures of previous pupils on the walls of the hallway - pupils who are now all dead. <br/><br/>This film is responsible for idiots saying ""Carpe Diem"". Its a bit long but its entertaining despite a downbeat end section."

MUCH better plot idea than the suicide one, IMO).. you could even have a tragic death of one of the kids.. but not suicide.. doesn't work for an ""inspirational"" movie.. as I said.. it was a FAILURE of everything that the teacher was teaching the students.. <br/><br/>I dunno.. it just left a bad taste in my mouth.. True, it was emotional, true, it was well- acted.. but I felt it slapped us in the face and ruined what could have been a great story.. <br/><br/>And I didn't find it believable that anyone (even a stuffy school) would ""Blame"" a teacher for his student's suicide under those circumstances. Investigate and fire?? No.. not for what that teacher did..doesn't make sense.. not believable.. as I said<br/><br/>Basically after the suicide everything went sour...the plot fell apart.. <br/><br/>LOL.. maybe part of it is I'm a real House addict, and had been enjoying Robert Sean Leanoard (looking VERY young and almost ""yummy"" LOL) and well.. I thought his suicide was the worst plot twist I'd ever seen.. It just went against everything the movie was about.. <br/><br/>So there you have my opinion.. COuld have been great, but a shocking suicide just doesn't fit with an ""inspirational"" story like this. <br/><br/>If I want to go be inspired, I'll go watch Apollo 13, October Sky, Mr. Holland's Opus,"

","This movie has its good moments and a decent storyline. However, it feels as clichés permeate and dominate the film.<br/><br/>I think the movie wants to be about nonconformism. However is it possible to fight conformisms with clichés? I see a problem there. The portrayal of the characters appears unreal to me, I cannot identify with them or with most of the situations.<br/><br/>You get the feeling that there is some kind of message pushed, but it is in a vacuum just like in the Little Princess by Saint Exupery. (In comparison I love Winnie the Pooh.)<br/><br/>It may be a tour the force as far as emotions are concerned. I certainly can understand why and how so many viewers are strongly effected. However, it does not really appeal to the intellectual in me, though the movie is (supposedly) about intellectuals! For me the film is an equivalent to a one dimensional action movie, but instead of the action the emotions are the only dimension.<br/><br/>There is one scene that I wish to recall which (if were more dominant in kind could improve the movie substantially) is when the boys stand on their desks.

","After these impressionable students graduate and go on to adult endeavors, do they remember the poets and poetry they studied--and are moved to read more? Or do they more fondly recall their colorful and unconventional teacher, with his unorthodox style of putting over his subject? <br/><br/>True, poetry has taken a down slide since the fifties, and for many adults, they hardly crack a book all year, though their library displays may be full. And when they do read, the last thing seems to be poetry.<br/><br/>So, Prof. John Keating has his work cut out: get the class' attention right off the bat, and keep holding it with innovative techniques. This he does, including standing on the table, doing imitations of Brando and Wayne reciting the Bard, and keeping the class on their feet and moving about.<br/><br/>When Prof. John's taken to task, his young admirers come to his defense, which gets pretty emotional before it's over. <br/><br/>Audiences seemed to go for this film, while critics were more divided. Robin Williams is energetic while yet being somewhat restrained, and Peter Weir's direction is quite serviceable.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not enough to allow the poetry to intrinsically speak for itself anymore. Perhaps teachers are competing with the media for students' attention, requiring more and more ""creative"" ways to get through. Whatever the case, Prof. Keating earned his keep through sheer effort exerted, if not through traditional academic standards."

","Mr Keating, a school teacher in a elite private school, uses his position to pursue a political agenda, namely to liberalize the school's curriculum, with tragic results. To achieve his political goals, the teacher encourages his students, all impressionable adolescents, to break the rules of the school, under the guise of promoting academic and personal freedom, and a group of his students respond by forming a secret society. These students have no idea that Mr. Keating is using them to promote strife between the faculty and student body, embarrass the school administration and thereby force change. As a result the students are placed in impossible conflictual situations that they are utterly incapable of resolving. Mr. Keating's manipulativeness is so blatantly reckless that it leads to one student committing suicide. Perhaps if Mr. Keating had communicated his concerns through appropriate administrative channels without involving the students, things would have worked out differently.

Today it's illegal to have a spirit, so do we pursue an artistic life in an age when Art is 200 years dead ? Absolve the painter for the seaman, the musican for the technician ? The theme to this film will span the next 600 years, in that tragic respect it makes this a classic.<br/><br/>I'd like to comment to Robert Lorenz, from Dresden, and anyone who; if posting destroys a film's credibility without giving one to compare it with, in doing so destroy their own. Also to dbdumonteil, who recommended Weir's embarrassing estrofest 'Picnic at Hanging Rock.' No doubt to be a favorite in Ivy/prep circles, this film does under-tone a bit too much for me, and in the music (the 80's being the shift to subtle scores). The Literature profs can tear this up all they like: picking Frost over Byron, not getting to the meat of Shakespeare, yet petty needling whilst crap like 'The Breakfast Club,' and 'The Deerhunter' was made and hailed. Cliché's abounding it's message supporting spiritual individualism sets it above the rest. Casting could have been a little better.<br/><br/>Maybe they meant 'Carpe spiritus' (seize the spirit) instead of 'carpe diem' which better synopsizes this film; a solid script telling us it is better to have attempted to live the life of the artist than to experience it as crude nonevent; always with dire consequence.<br/><br/>Enough cannot be said about Robert Sean Leonard in a radiant performance; also Robin William's best role ever, and Ethan Hawke's last best role ever.

","Firstly, I'm not saying that anyone's opinion is wrong. Opinions can't be wrong, by their very nature. That said, it does seem as though a great many people take a very skewed lesson from this story.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bother with rhetoric, I'm simply going to address the topic of the plot shift wherein Neil suicides. I've seen a great many posts from people saying that the lesson of Carpé Diem is completely undermined by the comedy-turned-tragedy moment of Neil's untimely death. Did anyone ever care to think that maybe the movie does not have the sole intention of imparting the wisdom of Carpé Diem to the young? Maybe the movie is much more well thought out than so many people seem to realize. <br/><br/>Consider, for a moment, a new perspective. One where the minor character of Neil's Father is designed to get the attention of every overbearing, zealous, and controlling parent out there. Suddenly, the lessons of Carpé Diem and of following one's heart take a backseat to the lesson of ""Live with your kin, not through them."" Just because you've always dreamed that your son would be an astronaut doesn't mean that your son doesn't dream of being a fireman. Think about what happens to a moth when you capture it in your hands. A moth has what can best be described as a thin powder coating on its wings. If this powder is wiped off, the moth loses its ability to fly and very soon thereafter dies. Now, all the moth has to do to survive is stop attempting to fly away. But, nine times out of ten, that moth will keep beating its wings until the 'dust' has all been pulled from its wings and stuck to your palms, at which point the moth's fate is sealed. Just as our moth will die before it will give up flying, so will the man who hears his calling die before being sculpted by another's dreams. The square peg cannot fit the round hole.<br/><br/>Now, think about how true-to-life this movie is. In the time of the story's setting, that was exactly how things worked. Even in modern times, this problem exists. Even if it's not as widespread or obvious.<br/><br/>The entire movie revolves around Neil's desire to play ""Puck"" and shun the path to becoming a doctor in favour of answering his spirit's call to act. To those who think of this as offering the lesson of cowardice, please consider that it may not be cowardice so much as simply an inability to be anything other than what his spirit was drawn towards. If you need oxygen to live, and someone else ensures that you will not receive any: what is to become of you?<br/><br/>Yes, there are a multitude of lessons contained in this multifaceted movie. Carpé Diem Stand for what you believe in Be Loyal etc... But the most important lesson can be summed into two words. ""Be Tolerant."" Be yourself, and allow others the same freedom. Just because you have the capability to control another is not to say that it is the right thing to do.<br/><br/>To the Youth: Follow Your Heart. To the Aged: Raise your children, but raise them in their own image. To Everyone: Be Tolerant of other people's choices. If you don't like the choices of others, don't make the same ones for yourself."

"anusha_chellappa","Null","0","1","14 February 2005"," It's a movie not a religious book.
","I liked Dead Poet's Society. I think movies should entertain, sometimes teach by exposing consequences of actions we ourselves would not dare to dowhen they do both it becomes classic. The question is what lesson you choose to learn. Now are you going to understand that romanticism scored over realism thanks to this movie or are you going to learn that there are times when an unfettered soul creates and some times when the undisciplined spirit destroysthat there is very little to differentiate between indiscipline and free-spiritedness. Robin Williams himself tells off (in a very smooth, suave way) Charlie when he almost gets himself expelled. It is not that easy, for anyone, let alone a 17 year old , to distinguish and behave appropriately. One unfortunately finds out through experience, in other words till it is too late. Todd Anderson was the only one who seemed to bring something positive into his nature. Neil Perry, despite claiming to be free-spirited does not learn to open himself to his father. The possible repercussions still bog him down till he meets his unfortunate end. Charlie was always the undisciplined and free individual  he only received a further boost to his ego with his interpretation of the Carpe Diem message. His loyalty to his friends was admirable all the same. Meeks was and remained a self-serving student. The effects of the message barely touched him except to evoke a few creative thoughts (probably to be used in English Poetry answers) Knox was a man bound by fear of rejection and stayed away from proposing to a girl who was already someone else's girlfriend. The message led him to read poetry to the girl and kiss her without her consent which act should have evoked a slap but just evoked an ""it's OK"" Someone's ego was boosted. But that he lamely apologized was hearteningbut not enough of the lesson penetrated him. So basically only Todd gained positively. Even that could just be because his defect was his shyness and an obvious defect is easier to rectify than a concealed one. Why do teachers not advise or propagate free-spiritedness? Why do they ask you to conform? Isn't it at least partly because there are no ways of controlling what will happen nextno way to distinguish creativity from destructionbecause it will confuse the adolescent mind. In a way I believed what the Head said. 17 year olds(or any sane person really) should be encouraged to think for themselves but they should be told what their limits are as well. Else even someone with good intentions like Robin Williams will find himself tricked by the follower of advice. Finally I thought it was an encouraging lesson. It needn't make you want to read all those poetry books...but it reminds of you of higher, more beautiful feelings...makes you want to aim higher for yourself. Seeing Robin William's freedom of spirit encourages you to reach the pinnacle of your potential in your way. It needn't be by reading poetryany way you invent and make possible is fine."

Certainly, those things are 'up front and center' in this film. Even so, my personal sense is that the film's greatest emotional power stems from and is communicated through its fabulous use of foreshadowing/parallelism(s) and assorted kinds of symbolism, subtle elements that are not often mentioned in discussions of DPS.

Weir challenged his actors (just as Keating challenged his students) and drew out of them their best creative and collaborative efforts, even allowing them varying degrees of license to invent their own dialogue and action-and not just Robin Williams, whose bread and butter is improvisation, but the student character actors also, who were only '18 after all' (Robert Sean Leonard's own words, in a note he wrote to me in November 1996).<br/><br/>What this adds up to is a group of outstanding young actors 'coming of age' in their own lives and careers through Weir's mentoring at the very time they were playing student characters undergoing the same thing at Keating's hand; thus, Weir gets irrepressibly dynamic and believable performances from Hawke, Leonard, Charles, Hansen, Kussman, Ruggiero, Waterston, et al. I've read that DPS was filmed in sequence and suspect that the 'real time' shooting progression only enhanced the 'Weir/Keating' effect further.<br/><br/>I mentioned foreshadowing, parallelism(s) and symbolism above, and while there are many examples of those elements throughout the film-too many to recount here, unfortunately-I should note that they all seem to converge, rather like a lens which powerfully focuses sunlight down to a single, burning point, during the 'signature Peter Weir moment' in DPS-the scene in which Neil dons Puck's crown for the last time and then slowly bows his head while standing bare-chested at his opened bedroom window before the frosty, mystical night air.

I think it's power is universal.It transcends gender stereotypes even though the movie itself is probably loaded with them. The way I saw it, this movie is still potent today for one simple reason: We are, a career oriented society. Engineers, Doctors, Lawyers is what many people out there want to become. What is worse, they assume that once they obtain their ""goals"" they've got it made. THey don't have to do develop their intellect any further.

The arts are not important. What's important is making money.<br/><br/>Dead poets, was a gentle reminder to all of us that this way of thinking is detrimental to our entire existence. We may exist and lead a good life by becoming bankers and lawyers and what not...but if these professions (and making money) are the only things we live for, then, to paraphrase Mr Keating, we're not really living. <br/><br/>More than just a great movie, Dead Poets is an anthem to all those people out there who chose to think outside this box society sets up for us. I don't know if I'll ever be able to truly live and be true to the maxim that drives the movie (there's always be a nagging feeling inside of me saying ""have you truly done everything your heart wanted"")but I do know that this movie will serve as a perpetual reminder of the possibilities life offers, and of the important role the arts play in the life of one individual.<br/><br/>Carpe diem.

How many of you notice nature, or people, or animals. How many thank God or somebody else for the great times they have had.

","If someone has not been deeply moved and inspired by such a wonderful film as ""Dead Poets Society"", I really don't know what can do the trick for him/her... ""DPS"" was the nice surprise of the late 80s: Appeared out of nowhere (no big-time promotion, smallish budget, not-very-well-known actors at that time apart from Robin Williams) and instantly stole the hearts and minds of virtually everybody who watched it. Within a short while, ""carpe diem"" and ""oh captain, my captain"" became familiar and beloved phrases. Moreover, the film became a legend for its spirit of free-thinking and its message of ""seizing the day"" and managing one's destiny.<br/><br/>""DPS"" is about a newly-arrived teacher Mr. Keating (Williams) into Welton, a traditional, respected, and rigid school in the late 50s. Not only is Mr. Keating himself a graduate from ""Hell-ton"", but he is also carrying with him a free-thinking and innovative style which is utterly incompatible with the ways the Welton pupils had been used to. The professor transmits his magic to his pupils, including among others Todd Anderson (Hawke), the shy brother of a famous Welton graduate, and his room-mate, Neil Perry (Leonard), a talented boy who is kept under the wings of an oppressive father. Mr. Keating's magic transforms his boys' beliefs and ideals, but unfortunately not all good things in life last forever...<br/><br/>Williams is simply unforgettable as Mr. Keating, a role which for many people (including me) has been forever associated with him. What is even more striking, is the astonishing performance of all the young boys: From the then-unknown Ethan Hawke, to Gale Hansen as Charlie ""Nuwanda"" Dalton, and of course, to Robert Sean Leonard as Mr. Keaton's star pupil, Neil Perry.<br/><br/>This is a movie everyone should watch: It may have no dazzling shoot-outs and special effects, star actors and sexy actresses, and all the other usual Hollywood block-buster elements, but it is one of those films that you never forget. 10/10."

There are also many great acting jobs done by Williams (in more of a supportive role), Hawke, Leanord and especially Smith playing Mr. Perry. If it wasn't for his powerful performance as the overbearing controlling father this movie would not nearly have the impact it does.

","Dead Poets' Society is one of my favourite films. The story itself may be sentimental at times. However, as an English teacher, I think that one of the most important aspects of this film is its eloquent apology for the Arts, speaking up against all those grey, colourless, unimaginative forces of society who claim that only those things that are ""profitable"" in terms of dollars and cents are worth while doing.<br/><br/>Teaching and studying poetry, literature or even the arts in general has an infinite value in itself - and still we are oh, so often met by the question: ""what are we going to use this for?"", or ""what possible value does this have?"".<br/><br/>John Keating's words - I've memorised them by heart - are the most eloquent reply I have yet heard to such pathetic, Philistine questions. He says: ""We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race, and the human race is filled with passion. Business, law, medicine, engineering - these are noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love - these are what we stay alive for!""  These are words which should have been forcibly fed to all those right-wing politicians who seem to think that government grants to culture and the arts is only a waste of money. It is not - on the contrary, it is an investment in life itself!<br/><br/>To me, the most touching scene is the very last one, where Keating returns to his room to pick up his personal belongings after having been fired, and the boys, one by one, starting with the shy, modest Todd (Neil's room mate) step up on their desks, saying ""Oh Captain, my Captain!"" - one final act of defiance against the rigid school rules, one final proof that the seeds sown by Keating have borne fruit after all: the boys will remember what he taught them about thinking for themselves, about avoiding the dangers of conformity, and about striving to see the world from new perspectives."

","Dead Poets Society has inspired me in many ways, and I imagine it has inspired others as well.  There were many themes covered in this film, the one that stands out the most to me is the cry for individuality, freedom, and expression.  The movie takes place in a strict college prep school in the 1950's, where discipline and academics are brainwashed into every student.  From the stern headmaster to the scapegoating of John Keating (Robin Williams), this movie provided a great conflict.  Keating challenged his students to make their own choices, to be creative and expressive. Above all, he wanted his students to Carpe Diem, to seize the moment, because one day we will be dead.<br/><br/>Each of Keating's feature students are developed well in this movie.  You see how each of them struggles to find their own individuality away from their strict parents and the strict guidelines of the school.<br/><br/>I liked the part played by Josh Charles (Knox Overstreet).  Knox is madly infatuated with a cheerleader (Alexandra Powers) from a cross-town public high school, but struggles to find the courage to tell her his feelings. The girl is already dating a jerk football player (Colin Irving), which makes matters worse.  I feel alot of us have been in that situation before, and we feel we are trapped by this fate.  Knox is inspired by John Keating to express his feelings through poetry and a carpe diem approach.  The results are charming!<br/><br/>This movie inspired me because I have always loved to write and was a true believer in following your own path, not to just follow the one paved out by the majority.  It doesn't mean you have to be odd or outrageous, but to just be yourself, plain and simple.<br/><br/>I read the comments from Theo Robertson, and I must point out that not every student in this movie comes from a wealthy background, like Theo wants us to believe.  Robert Sean Leonard plays Neil Perry, the son of a working-class father (played by Curtwood Smith).  His father had to work hard to give his family a nice home and to give his son an opportunity to attend a ""rich-kid"" prep school. The conflict comes when Neil wants to become an actor, despite his father being absolutely against it, claiming it was silly and a waste of academic talent.  This conflict becomes the focus and climax of the movie.<br/><br/>I don't want to ruin the ending, so if you've never seen Dead Poets Society, or haven't seen it in its entirety, please do!  I have seen this film at least 20 times, and I will probably watch it another 20 times before I can no longer seize the day..."

","Dead Poet's Society is a delightfully well-crafted coming-of-age film from director Peter Weir who has garnered his most recent notoriety for ""Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World.""  In this film, Weir takes us to a small New England prep-school at the tail end of the 1950's and shows us one school term in the life of a teacher and the group of students that he inspires.  This film is an emotional roller-coaster and features subtly brilliant performances from the entire cast.  This may very well have been Robin Williams' finest hour.  We are given a slew of passionate performances and a truly inspired script which unquestionably deserved the Oscar that year. This film is also a great lesson in independence and free thought. Throughout the course of the film, we see the group of students who re-form the Dead Poet's Society grow from boys into men.  They find their own voices and learn to 'seize the day.'

If the film that is set in the 1950s and deals a lot with poetry, why does it include poems by Herrick, Tennyson and Byron yet omit writings from people like Kerouac, Ginsberg and other post-modern authors?  There is too much of an emphasis on the strictness of the times and the adults besides Keating are portrayed solely as authority figures.  Neil's suicide seems like a perfunctory way finish the film.  Why couldn't he have run away to Hollywood or something similar to that?

","I've actually seen complaints about this film that point out that it is not very funny. Oddly enough, the film isn't a comedy, so I'm surprised anyone would expect it to be funny. Dead Poets Society is a graceful and elegant melodrama centered around the coming of age of young prep school boys through the discovery of the souls of dead poets in their classic works.<br/><br/>Robin Williams injects much needed levity with bits that absolutely must have been ad-libbed as only he could. The Marlon Brando and John Wayne impressions are simply side-splitting. But it is in his dramatic moments you see that Williams range is far wider than the comedic fare for which he is known. In fact, it is those moments of cunning insight and biting wit that few actors can create where Williams' finest work lies. There is no shortage of such moments here.<br/><br/>This is not the typical kids acting like idiots in school lame groaner that most high school films are. It is intelligent and insightful, woven around disparate young men dangerously involved in the discovery of self. And dangerous it is, as discovery often reveals hidden conflict.<br/><br/>Robert Sean Leonard is simply stunning. His conflicted portrayal of a boy whose father's expectations are not aligned with his own dreams culminates in one of the most unforgettable scenes in the genre. Ethan Hawke is beautifully brittle as a young boy about to enter his own maturity.<br/><br/>If you don't have tears in your eyes at the final scene, you should be forbidden by law ever to watch another movie in your life. So many people live lives of quiet desperation, and if you ever had a teacher, or ever were that teacher, who encouraged young minds to seize the day, this is a film you will always treasure for the towering accomplishment it is. <br/><br/>Director Peter Weir litters the scenery with insider jokes and symbols present in all his films, and if you don't know them or get them, you won't miss a thing. His body of work is nonetheless historically significant, and this could be the jewel in his crown."

","'Dead Poets Society' is a beautiful movie from start to finish. The movie tells the story of a new English teacher, Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), who is a lot different than other teachers. He wants the students to think for themselves although other teachers disagree with this vision. They think a boy that is 17 years old is not able to think for himself. You can imagine how the story develops; the students like Mr. Keating, the other teachers don't.<br/><br/>Mr. Keating teaches poetry to the students, and inspires some of them to do things they never thought they would do. Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) discovers that his real passion is acting, and Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) learns he can do a lot more than he thought he could. There is also a story line involving a student named Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is in love with a girl and because of Mr. Keating he tries to win her over. Of course things can't go right and some tragic events happen. I will not reveal them here. May be they are not very surprising but they do have an impact.<br/><br/>Robin Williams as the smart and funny teacher has one of his finest roles here. He is known as a funny guy, but as in 'Good Will Hunting' he finds the perfect way for this part. The students are all very good as well, especially Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Hansen, who plays a guy named Charlie Dalton. The fine direction by Peter Weir completes this very beautiful and interesting movie."

","Staged entirely within the secular ambiance of a Boarding School where values such as tradition, honor, discipline and excellence are stressed out, `Dead Poets Society' proposes a critical analysis of the system's preaching of a line of indoctrination close to that of populism where freedom and variety of choice are guaranteed to those who condescend to the system's pre-selected choices.<br/><br/>Concomitantly, several facets of social incongruence interplay within the depicted social strata proportionally to the expansion of the characters' inter-dynamics.<br/><br/>Furthermore, stereo-typification among the characters denounces the existence of oppression within the oppressed, an empirical trait probably osmotically absorbed from the macro-sphere, setting equal grounds for all dissimilar plans which will develop within the story.<br/><br/>The most fundamental argument therein, nonetheless, lies in pondering the purpose of life as to its finality while keeping the value of altruism omnipresent. Thus, a powerful argument as to the symbiotic interrelation between qualification and quantification is set as to overshadow all other disseminating lines of thought throughout the story, a point whose substantiality is intertextually argued under the pretense that lyricism cannot and must not be scientifically equated as any attempt in accepting such equating would signify a loss of perspective on one's humanity.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is further argued that daring will necessarily lead to knowledge which, in turn, will lead to empowerment; leading, thus, to dissent from the system's coercions; a paradox which dictates the empowerment of the individual through sound analytical thought to be the only way to commune from authentic freedom, a byproduct only achievable through non-compliance and non-conformance to the pre-established.<br/><br/>The correlation between the authority of the overseer and the humiliation of the overseen is one portrayed as omnipresent. It is further argued that abuse of power by the overseer will generate morbidity of the social dynamics among the overseen and that, in order to withstand successful opposition to the overseer, the camaraderie amongst the overseen must accommodate the vulnerability of the self as to denote acceptance of individual differences and subsequent intra-micro-sphere maturation, further recognizing the possibility of simplicity while concurrently denying the plausibility of ordinary.<br/><br/>Dictating that a certain level of anarchy is necessary within each individual, it is also demonstrated, nonetheless, that should no conscious attention be paid to the social development a micro-sphere, it will become tribal and, once self-actualized, it is likely to exhibit patterns of behavior analog to those objected in mother-sphere.<br/><br/>Altruism, which is an essential component to the dissent from the overseer's oppression, will lead to personal sacrifice, whose extent should be accurately conveyed as to the capability and finality of each individual and action respectively given ultimate altruism will lead to ultimate frustration, leading, in turn, to a refraction as to the sense of personal empowerment.<br/><br/>Carpe Diem!"

","My diary informs me that I liked this film in 1989, of which I remember nothing today: <br/><br/>Very good movie. I feared it would be just a Robin Williams ""vehicle"", another story about an unconventional young teacher clashing with the stuffy authorities. As I watched the movie I kept wondering whether it was upholding personality or principle. Was it just a paean to a wonderful teacher, something like ""To Sir with Love"" or was it upholding some principle? There were moments when I was about to dismiss the movie as a pretentious version of ""Beach party bingo"", Franky Avalon gone Ivy League. When one of the students, well, no spoilers, I feared the movie was degenerating into soap opera. Then I feared a sudden happy ending that would tilt the balance toward personality and narcissism and away from principle. But at the very end, it becomes clear that it is the other way around. Conventionality and conformity cannot be defeated. However, the ideals of Thoreau and other free-thinkers cannot be either."

","The time is the mid-1950's and we find ourselves within the hallowed walls of a New England Prep School enclave: Welton Academy.  Robin Williams turns in his finest dramatic performance of his career with this film as English Professor John Keating.  Although his teaching methods and most of his ways are unorthodox, Keating fires up his students by making them defy conventionality and actually begin thinking for themselves and not for how others see them.  Without giving too much of the film away, it is a tearjerker but you also stand up and cheer at certain moments.  It is a heartfelt slice of American Cinema History.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay) winning for Best Original Screenplay, losing Best Picture to Driving Miss Daisy.

I should probably consider becoming a critic for some highly prized magazine or newspaper, but I prefer to do what I love.<br/><br/>Something about this movie speaks to the viewer.  The characters are convincing.  It is easy, not only to identify with them, but to grow into them, to be concerned for them, to want to heal their troubles.  I'm sure we've all had a moment where we've been afraid to express ourselves in front of others.  I am sure we have all wanted that certain other someone who may or may not have felt the same way about us as we did for them.

"Old Joe","Null","0","1","19 May 2003"," He was their inspiration. He made their lives extraordinary.
","Carpe deium - 'seize the day', is the inspirational message from 1989's, 'Dead Poets Society'. Directed by Australia's Peter Weir, it is a movie that is good for young impressionable teenagers to watch and learn what poetry can do for people, whether they are struggling to write, falling in love or are inspired by someone who has done something in the past that they want to revive all over again. Although, parts of this movie could be called 'clichÃ©d', it is a movie that I will continue to refer to, for a longtime to come.<br/><br/>When charismatic English professor John Keating arrives at a strict boys academy, his unconventional teaching methods breathe new life into the curriculum steeped in tradition. With his wit and wisdom, Keating inspires his students to pursue individual passions and make their lives extraordinary. Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society has touched audiences and critics alike with its brilliant acting, uplifting story and superb craftsmanship.<br/><br/>What a joy this movie is. Director Peter Weir directed it in such a style that I really liked. It was interesting to learn that Weir was willing to do things a little different, which I feel is ironic, considering that is one of the story's main themes. Weir also sounds like the kind of guy that kept inspiring his cast to be as 'good as they can'. I feel that Weir's improvisations only enhanced the picture all the more.<br/><br/>
However, the story of the movie also needs to be applauded. Written by Tom Schulman, who won an academy award for his work, he wrote a really inspirational story from where I viewed it. But it was also much more. It had interesting characters, both young and old, with the Mr. Keating just terrific. Yet the themes of DPS are also important. They include 'seize the day', 'standing up for yourself', 'facing your fears', the traditions of conservatism and that conforming is not the best way to live your life. The movie gives all these aspects good attention, and all are important, especially in the DPS's young lives.<br/><br/>The cast of DPS was also well chosen. John Keating (Robin Williams) is a fine teacher, although he does things just a little bit different. Sure he was a rebellious student in his young days, but as an adult, he has a charismatic style and past that helps inspire the main group of boys in the movie. One of my favourite scenes in the movie has to be when Mr. Keating tells all his poetry class to rip out, 'Mr. J. Evans Pritchard's introduction titled 'understanding poetry'. Keating calls it 'excrement'. Then when a passing senior teacher sees the ripping of books going on, he is flabbergastered, thinking that foul play is going on.<br/><br/>
I also liked the young members of the cast, who restart the 'Dead Poets Society'. They include Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd (brilliant acted by Ethan Hawke), Knox (Josh Charles), who is infatuated by a pretty girl called Chris (Alexandra Powers), Charlie, aka Nwanda, (Gale Hanson), Richard (Dylan Kussman), Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero) and Pitts (James Waterston). All these boys are different, some funny, some sad, some trying to workout what they are. But via the reinvention of the DPS, they all use the phrase 'seize the day' to change their lives, for their better and/or worse.<br/><br/>
Yet some of these characters find it hard to live up to expectations of traditional school or their parents. Neil has a very rocky and difficult relationship with his father (Kurtwood Smith) and goes to drastic measures to be rid of the problem. The way Neil deals with his problems might seem the easy way out, but when a bad situation seems inescapable, desperate people can do desperate things.<br/><br/>Then the problems that we see confronting Todd are also important lesson to learn from. The scene which involves Todd getting up in front of the class to recite a poem was terrific and shows how big of an effect Mr. Keating is having on such introverted student. He knows Todd can be a brilliant poet, he just needs the confidence to bring it out. A friend said that it was ironic that Hawke played the role of a struggling writer, considering that in real life he is a writer, having some works published.<br/><br/>
The good parts behind the scenes of DPS include the great sets that were used. I especially like the school grounds used for 'Welton Academy', as it gave me the distinct impression that we are introduced into a proud boy's school. Music was also put to good use in DPS, with the playing of bag pipes creating great tension and emotion for the film. I believe it continues on that feel of tradition that accompanies such a school like that of the 'Welton Academy'. The music was composed by Maurice Jarre and sound done by the late Allan Splet.<br/><br/>'Dead Poets Society' might not be everyone's idea of a 'good movie', as some will look at it and say 'that has all been done before, in a much better way'. However I am one person whose game enough to say that this is a pretty good movie in all of the aspects I have mentioned. The conclusion to the movie is really powerful in my opinion, and shows to the audience that these boys have respect for their teacher and that they have taken the steps to be able to 'seize the day'. I read Roger Ebert's review for DPS, and felt he was very harsh on the film, and disagree with his 'not enjoyable movie' tag, as it was thoroughly enjoyable from where I viewed it. I first watched 'Dead Poets' at school many years ago, which was the perfect place to do so, as it will make students, like I was, inspired to be whatever they want to be someday. Everyone, please, carpe deium and 'seize the day'.<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'Dead Poets Society': 4 (Very Good Film)"

The overall mood set forth by Peter Weir ties this anthology of human landscapes together with consistency and believability. I feel the cast did a superb job and gave extraordinary performances that never upstaged their co-actors (difficult considering the caliber of the cast). In a business saturated with over zealot melodrama, high-concept film making, and flashy dialogue, this was a treat. Schulman ensured the screenplay flowed well from one story to the next and Weir helmed it properly; maintaining rhythm and an uncluttered sense of purpose of the individuals portrayed. William's character exuded intellectual and emotional superiority and he was perfect in the role of the mentoring poet of yore (Inspiring!). This film is a keeper. Thanks guys."

What this movie tells us is that if you do indeed ""Seize the day"" and go up against the establishment, YOU WILL LOSE.<br/><br/>
Robin Williams plays a sorely underdeveloped English teacher who teaches his pupils through very unorthodox methods and encourages them to live life to the fullest. Most of the students come to love him and begin living ""deliberately"". One student is advised by Williams to follow his dream of acting, which the student's father has forbade him to do. There is a tragedy, a scandal, and in the end, it is not the rebel and his followers who triumph, but the establishment. <br/><br/>The moral of the story? Following your dreams leads to disappointment. Going up against the establishment and standing up for what you believe in leads to failure. Overbearing parents will always win. <br/><br/>Some may find this movie inspirational, but I found it pessimistic at best. If you really want to see Williams go up against the establishment, go and watch ""Good Morning, Vietnam"". If you want to see students triumph over adversity, watch ""Stand and Deliver"".

And, oddly, it's hard for me to put my finger on the reason I was struck that way. Perhaps it had to do with feeling that the development of Neil's father was too much of a caricature of the stifling heartless b***ard dad. Also, it just seemed too easy; almost formulaic. The symbol of Neil's Puck crown doubling as a crown of thorns was overdone. They didn't trust the viewers' capacity to pick up on it without a big ritualization scene.

Ultimately it shows that free thinking often has tragic consequences and perhaps society and expectation have more of a grip on our lives than we would wish.<br/><br/>I think ultimately this film has a hopeful message as we see that there are people willing to push expectations that little bit and that is always a good thing especially because it enhances our lives and teaches us so much.<br/><br/>Peter Weir did an excellent job on this as he did on 'The Truman Show' many years later. The cast was terrific particularly Robin Williams as the inspirational John Keating and Ethan Hawke as Todd"

","The movie is fantastic! We watched the movie in school for our English class and it can really touch your life whether you expected it or not. I watched the movie several years ago but the meaning of the movie didn't sink in as deep as it has now. I'm not really a poet but i write some literary works and the movie taught me how to write literature - from the heart. It's such a great movie and people, especially teens, can relate with the movie. It tells us that life is something more than just time and events, life is action and feelings. The spark of life can only be found if one lives spontaneously and by his own commands; not by schedules or procedures. The movie was also about the human spirit - feelings, emotions, rationality, understanding and boldness. I learned through the movie that we should obtain the zest of life through seizing the day, seeing the world in a new perspective, not being ashamed or afraid of being different, taking charge of your own life, reaching your dreams and standing for what you believe in. All these things are important lessons that people should not only learn; they should practice it. I therefore recommend this movie to all people who needs inspiration because trust me - it will do the job.<br/><br/>

","1989 was one of them years where it seemed every Oscar-nominated picture deserved to scoop the prize.  Dead Poets Society missed out but that doesn't stop it from ranking as one of the best films of the Eighties.  Robin Williams shines in his finest film as Mr. Keating, an unconventional English teacher at a New England prep school who inspires and awakens his pupils - summed up with one famous catchphrase, ""seize the day"".  The film then focuses on the effect Keating's influence on a group of boys, with both successful and tragic consequences.  This could have easily been overly sentimental and clichÃ©-ridden but the script (which did win the Oscar) is believable, absorbing and observing, which successfully conveys the spirit and impact of the story.  All the important, crucial parts are perfectly cast and expertly performed by stars young and old.  An inspired film that will most certainly inspire whoever watches it.  And that's exactly what great films are all about."

","Robin Williams has tarnished his reputation somewhat in recent years with an upsetting leaning towards sentimentality, but back in 1989, he turned in what was quite possibly the performance of his life in Dead Poets Society.<br/><br/>Also showcasing the talents of Robert Sean Leonard and a young Ethan Hawke, the film tells of a group of broading school students whose rigid world is upturned by the arrival of an unorthodox English teacher (Williams). Inspired to reform an old subversive literature club, the impassioned students spend their evenings ""sucking the marrow out of life"", but their newfound love of life does not sit well against the school's austere attitude, and their gentle rebellion spirals towards tragedy.<br/><br/>Visually sumptuous, Dead Poets Society is a perfectly moulded drama.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"

","A wonderful film, typical of Peter Weir. I thought performances were stunning (especially Ethan Hawke, whose portrayal of being hassled was so perfect, he was even blushing), Robert Sean Leonard was also very convincing in his passionate obsession with acting. I must say I'm not awfully keen on Robin Williams, but that's probably more to do with his looks than his acting ability. Anyhow, his over-zealousness made me feel a wee bit uneasy a couple of times (perhaps I have myself been unfortunate, never seen a teacher so passionate about teaching), particularly where he's squatting down among the class, urging them to huddle.<br/><br/>I seem to have noticed something that hasn't been mentioned here. The closeness between Todd and Neil has just a tinge of emotional attachment, that is more intense than just a close adolescent friendship of two boys sharing a dorm. Yet again, this theme (if indeed it is intended) would've been so easy to exaggerate and ruin by adding the unnecessary elements of physicality, which thankfully hasn't been done, thus contributing another very important thread to the sensitive poetic nature."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I can't quite articulate how much I despise this sorry excuse for a piece of entertainment. It might come as a shock to a lot of cinema-goers who found it 'heartwarming' or 'inspiring', but I regard this as unequivocally the crappiest film ever made. I mean it actually makes me want to throw up.<br/><br/>All Robin Williams movies are identical in terms of narrative structure. He's a 'zany', funny guy who arrives in some stuffy institutionalised environment, and sets about bucking the system, making a difference, changing traditional perspectives. Oh God, no, please. This is beyond sad.<br/><br/>
In this movie he plays an English teacher whose unconventional teaching style inspires his pupils to get into literature and poetry. These contemptable losers then go and set up a secret society where they read poetry and smoke pipes in the woods. Now, if they'd pulled something like this at the school I went to, they'd all soon find that their lives were no longer worth living.<br/><br/>Obviously the old codgers who run the posh private school don't take to kindly to Williams' crazy antics, such as persuading his whole class to stand on their desks and behave like complete cretins. Then they sort of march around and chant poetry. Can this dire nonsense get any worse ?<br/><br/>
Absolutely. It continues to insult my inteligence right to the bitter, stinking end. There's some bloke who's supposed to be going to medical school, who due to the influence of Williams, decides he'd rather take up acting instead. His father is fairly p****d off at this development - and who can blame him ? Anyway, to cut a long and extremely cheesy story short, the guy kills himself with his father's pistol because he can't be an actor. I have to admit that I laughed out loud at this point, simply because the character pretty much deserved to die for being so utterly lame.<br/><br/>
Peter Weir, the director, has made some pretty good films including Gallipoli and The Truman Show (which everyone should find the time to watch), but this was without a doubt his darkest hour.<br/><br/>
As for Williams, please leave us alone now. You were once funny as a coked-up motormouth comedian in the seventies and early eighties, but the kind of faux-sincerity exemplified by this aberration is irritating to the point where his grinning face mkes my blood boil with rage.<br/><br/>
Good Morning Vietnam and Patch Adams are probably just as bad or perhaps even worse - I wouldn't know as I was unable to sit through either of them.<br/><br/>
The opinions expressed here probably won't be enormously popular, as judging by some of the gushing reviews on IMDb this movie has a special place in lots of people's hearts. To those people I prescribe an episode of Mork & Mindy each day until they make a full recovery from their deep-rooted Robin Williams affliction...."

","I have read several of the comments regarding the movie, including the good, bad, and the ugly.  Seizing the day and taking the path less traveled to expand and explore perceptions has consequences. Not being a poet, my personal thoughts are better expressed in this short analogy, ""Lord, grant me the serenity to accept things I can not change, courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.""  The age of the young men in the movie appeared to have been about 15 to 17 years of age. Knowledge and personal perception can be powerful allies or they can destroy us as individuals.  As adults we have an obligation to make every attempt to explain personal responsibility and the consequences of our actions, as well as our thoughts.  Knowledge without wisdom is like giving someone a loaded gun and not explaining what will happen if we pull the trigger. Just food for thought."

","Anyone familiar with the Muriel Spark novel ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" or the film of the same name will easily spot parallels with this 1980s Robin Williams picture, in which he plays an idealistic English teacher who inspires his pupils to greatness.<br/><br/>The setting has been updated into an exclusive rural American boys school, where the pupils are made to swear by the ethos of ""Tradition, Honour, Discipline, Excellence."".  In walks John Keating (Williams), who introduces a radical approach to educating his pupils that clashes with the staid traditionalism of the school, a process which eventually leads to tragedy...<br/><br/>The film is without a doubt exceptionally well made.  It is very well shot, acted and directed and is a consistent pleasure to watch.  The main problem is with the storyline and characters, both of which remain quite cliched and don't possess ambiguity or depth.  With the exception of Keating (and a slightly liberal-minded colleague) virtually all the adults are harsh and repressive with no explanation as to why they are this way, or why they stick so rigidly to their positions.  Only a few of the boys in Keating's class are given much personality, and the rest are filler characters whom we learn very little about.  Rounding them all out would have maybe taken longer, but would have made the film more interesting.<br/><br/>The film's main strength is the actors.  Ethan Hawke's Todd and Robert Sean Leonard's Neil get the lion's share of the screen time as Keating's two chief pupils, and they make the most of it.  Hawke is a lonely young man neglected by his rich parents, and Leonard is a sensitive creative soul with a frustrated passion for acting.  Both actors clearly depict the thin line of tragedy running through these spoiled young boys very well.<br/><br/>Of the adults, Kurtwood Smith is on fine form as Neil's tyrannical father. Alas, his part is that of the standard mean old father and he's never given any background.  Nevertheless, Smith really makes the audience hate him within his limited amount of screen time yet when he tells his son to become a doctor not an actor, you can't help feeling he has a point.<br/><br/>Make Miss Jean Brodie a man while removing her fascistic undertones and you have the essence of John Keating.  The problems with the character are the same with all the others, yet Williams overcomes these and makes Keating a sympathetic, passionate and likeable man.  The film livens up whenever he is onscreen.  <br/><br/>In conclusions, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a very sophisticated, well acted film.  Regardless of the lack of depth, it remains an enjoyable film experience."

","Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Green Card, Witness) has done many good movies, and I always look forward to seeing his latest work. ""John Keating""  Robin Williams (What Dreams May Come) inspires his students toward free thinking and poetry. One the students had a father who did not have a clue about understanding his son's emotional needs causes the kid to commit suicide. Not taking responsibility for his own actions, the father incites the school head master to get rid of the professor. That was the sad part to me because in other boarding school movies such as: Circle of Friends, Scent of a Woman (at least partially a boarding school movie) the good wins, while in the Dead Poets the teacher gets fired. I did not like that unfair side of it. The kids do make a statement against the firing but primarily the bad guys win, at least that is my perception. The teacher wanted to inspire the students,  not the stuffy headmaster, and in that he succeeded.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that in this movie we have boys interested in poetry and not girls, which breaks some stereotypes. I enjoyed the movie. The cinematography is pretty. Ethan Hawke was a cute young adult when this movie was made. Favorite Scenes: The kids meeting at night in their secret place. The boys memorizing poetry on their own. John Keating, stepping on the desk: ""We must look at things in a different perspective."" Favorite Quotes:  ""Four disciplines: Brilliance, honor, discipline, excellence.""  Professor John Keating: ""Seize the day"";  ""Words and ideas can change the world.""; ""Strive to find your voice""; ""We are not laughing at you.  We are laughing near you.""

","Robin Williams has played a doctor, another doctor, a disk jockey, a toymaker, a loony scientist, and so on through a long list - each character somehow different from everyone else in his profession, each with a certain something that makes everyone else adore him, each obviously in possession of a huge ego, each given an opportunity to do some Robin Williams schtick, each determined to steal the movie at all costs.  He's like that here, too. So what's the difference?<br/><br/>It's fourfold:<br/><br/>(1)  Peter Weir is far from being my favourite director - he's capable of pretentious turkeys like ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", for one thing - but he's not a hack.  Weir makes it worth watching in a number of ways other than those mentioned below.<br/><br/>(2)  If you see through the Cult of Williams and notice things which escape its adherents (Keating really IS a poor English teacher; the chapter he urges his students to tear out of their books is saying perfectly sensible things and at any rate, it's a strange thing to tell them to do under the guise of getting them to ""think for themselves""; the hero-worship the students indulge in IS disturbing and unhealthy), it doesn't matter.  The central story concerns the student Neil and how he acquires moral courage. It works as a story whatever attitude we take or ought to take towards Mr. Keating.  The film is NOT just , ""Why Robin Williams is right and everyone else is wrong.""<br/><br/>(3)  The villains ... actually, there aren't really any villains, and of the teachers who oppose Mr. Keating, one, at least, is both sensible and sympathetic.  Robin Williams has true counterweights.<br/><br/>(4)  Robin Williams does not sweep all before him in a wave of triumph. What triumph there is muted and limited in scope.  Trust me: that's exactly what you want in this movie.  The last thing you want to see is the Cult of Keating taking over the world.<br/><br/>""Dead Poets Society"" is a fine movie so long as not too much is claimed for it.  To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw: if you're under sixteen when you first see this movie and you don't feel that it will change your life, you have no heart; if you're over sixteen when you see it and you still feel that it will change your life, you have no head.<br/><br/>I was sixteen exactly.

","As someone who falls in love with A Separate Peace and the works of Thoreau and Emerson, I can't imagine a better movie.  The simple albeit complexly emotional plot captures the teenage struggle throwing the viewer into fits of nostalgia while simultaneously confronting our present-day selves, unfulfilled and making us regret the day we never had a teacher who shouted at us to seize the day when we seemed young enough to actually do just that. If that weren't enough, the characters deal with the touchy subject of suicide and guilt and sacrifice and altruism vs. selfishness.  Fabulous stuff."

So instead I'm going to briefly touch on the impact this film had on me as an individual.  Carpe Diem (sieze the day).  That pretty much sums up the feeling that this film instilled in me after viewing it.  It made me realize that there are more important things in life than just following ""tradition"" and doing what is expected of you.  It showed me that I must follow my own path in life, with what makes me truly happy, rather than conform with what is expected of me.  Also, I don't think I have ever been so touched by a single scene in a movie like I was with the final scene in this movie.  When you could see the guilt in the eyes of the Ethan Hawke character, knowing that he was partially responsible for Mr. Keating's dismissal.  You could tell he just wanted to tell Mr Keating how much he meant to all of his friends and him.  And you could also see the forgivness in the eyes of Robin Williams, knowing that the boys were not to blame, but rather the ""establishment"".  And when Mr. Keating was just about to leave the classroom for the last time, and Ethan Hawke jumped up on his desk and addressed Mr Keating ""Captain, My Captain!""... I literally wept out loud.  I have never cried during a movie like I did with this one.  I literally bawled that entire scene (when the students stood up on their desks), and didn't stop until half-way through the final credits.

","Even if this movie DOES border on the melodramatic at times, the moving and exceptional performances by all involved certainly earn it merit.

Encouraging his pupils to ""seize the day"", he stirs them to look beyond the confinements of whom they are told they should be, to that which they could and truly wish to become. Thriving under Keating's tutelage are Neil Perry (exceptionally well portrayed by Leonard), who discovers a passion for acting, and, as my friend Laura puts it, ""the painfully shy"", Todd Hamilton (Ethan Hawke could not have been better as the agonizing Todd). Conflicts arise however, when school officials and parents disagree with these new attitudes and work ethics, and strive to dimiss them. Albeit a tad slow in parts, stick with this film to end. The last scene is worth the wait."

","1st watched 4/7/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Peter Weir): Excellent story and superb direction by Weir make this drama work.  There have been many movies about teacher's who relate to their students in greater ways than what normally is expected but this one is more about the students than the teacher.  Robin Williams plays a new English teacher for a very high-brow preparatory school and doesn't follow the book to teach his kids.  He emphasizes that they ""Sieze"" every day because it may be their last and teaches them how poetry is about passion of life rather than just a subject in school.  Some of the students grab a-hold of his teaching and form a secret soceity that reads poetry in a scary cave near the school. The philosophy bleeds into their lives and starts to reek havic on their normal everyday lives but they for once are truly learning about themselves and learning from their life experiences. A tragedy occurs with one of the students and this is where the story takes a turn and life starts to be the judge as to whether the students really believe what they think they do. Excellent performances and a compelling story keep you involved with the characters till the end.  In my opinion, the ending left a lot to be desired but the rest of the movie was a typical well-done Peter Weir directed story."

","Dead Poets Society is one of those movies that left me moved and shocked for a long period of time. The storyline is original and the acting is brilliant, not to mention Peter Weir's outstanding direction. It really goes to prove that Robin Williams isn't strictly a comic actor, and that in even the most serious of roles he can excel. There is, however, some comic relief in this movie from both Williams and the rest of the cast that adds to the enjoyment of this classic. <br/><br/>For all moviegoers alike, don't miss this one - great to hear that films such as Dead Poets Society are being made by Australian directors!"
"enigmatrilogy","Null","0","1","6 March 2002"," Robin Williams Produces Fine Performance
","Dead Poets Society provides a performance that surely rates among the best acting that Robin Williams has produced during his career.  This film seeks to celebrate the discovery of life, during adolescence.  Robin Williams character, English professor John Keating, inspires his students to live life to the fullest and ""Seize the day"".  Their lives are indeed brightened and sharpened as they awaken their minds to beautiful poetry, while their eyes are opened to a myriad of new sensations around them.  Whereas their parents have high academic hopes for these boys, the young men themselves are discovering that there is more to life than following parental ambition. But, this conflict leads to tragedy as these two desires collide.  The expression upon the face of Mr Keating following this tragedy and the inner turmoil that he displays touches one deep inside.  The school though acts in the interests of ruthless self preservation, while Mr Keating's boys show their solidarity behind the teacher that has awoken their hungry minds.  It is certainly a shame that Robin Williams does not use his performance in this film as a touchstone for other performances.  Whereas he is measured in his acting in Dead Poets Society, other films betray a tendency to overact and ere in the side of sickly sweet sentimentality."

","There are several movies I adored that large portions of the population just didn't seem to get--""Moulin Rouge"" for example.  Logic dictates, therefore, that there must be films out there that a lot of people seem to really like which don't do that much for me.  And here, in ""Dead Poets Society"" we have the proof of the theorem.<br/><br/>First off, credit where it's due: Robin Williams is excellent as John Keating, an English teacher in a high-brow private school.  Dynamic as always, Williams provides the majority of this film's energy, creating the sort of teacher that we all wish we had in high school.  If the film had focused more on the relationship with Keating and the young men in his classroom, it might have been more inspirational.<br/><br/>Instead, we are treated to several scenes of quasi-male-bonding as the lads (headed by Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) ressurect the Dead Poets Society (founded by Keating in his school days) and dedicate themselves to rebellion and poetry, in that order.  Mostly they smoke and do things like try to impress women by reading poetry to them.  This really works, because the girls to whom they pay their addresses are so dim the boys can pass famous poetic work off as their own.  If, on being addressed with ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"" one of the women responded, ""Oh, I love Shakespeare!  Do you know 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments'?"" I would have been more impressed.  Leonard's character Neil gets bit by the acting bug, and is in raptures when he's cast as the ""lead role"" in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (I question the theory that ""Midsummer"" has any one lead, but that's just me). Another boy falls in love with a local cheerleeder because--well, because she's pretty, I guess.  This poor girl is resorted to telling the guy that her boyfriend will kill him if she's seen with him, a threat which I never really believed.<br/><br/>The movie takes it's worst nosedive near the end, where Neil, being forbidden to pursue his drama yen by his father, kills himself.  An abrupt and senseless move (I can think of half a dozen options which might have been more constructive), the suicide seems to exist for no other reason than to give the conservative staff of the school reason to rake Keating over the coals.  Even then, if Keating had not been reduced to a spectator in his own fate, the ending of the film might have been salvagable.  As it was, the conclusion was weak and unsatisfying, leaving me thinking ""Is that it""?"

In his unconventional lessons they learned how not to conform to the others. My favorite scene from the film was when Todd Anderson, the shy student from whom his parents expected so much, decided to stand up on the table to show Mr Keating what he had learned and the other guys from the ""Dead Poets Society"" followed his example. I don´t see the movie having too many subplots. They make it interesting and you can identify with the characters.

","Well-produced and well-acted, with Robin Williams as the standout (in one of his more consistently bearable performances). Essentially it's about some students who 'carpe diem' to varying degrees of success/failure. One overcomes shyness (well, sort of); one succumbs to parental pressure (in an eerie, overwrought, somewhat awkward scene); one gets his girl; one gets TWO girls; all participate in nocturnal cave meetings whose purpose I can't easily seem to relate to that of a poets' society (the dead ones would certainly turn in their graves methinks). Overall the story seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, and the final effect is one of dramatic indigestion. A better recommendation (and yet more Robin Williams) would be Good Will Hunting (1997).

My suspicions soon melted and I found myself captivated with one of the most extraordinary movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Robin Williams portrays new English teacher John Keating. He's not like the other teachers, who simply lecture information. He displays his lessons through charm, spite, and action, encouraging his students to ""Cease the day! Make your lives extraordinary!"" He tries to encourage free thinking among his students when the other teachers try to shoot that down.<br/><br/>He especially garners the interest of Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a free spirit who's held down by the rules and hardness of his father (Kurtwood Smith), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), who lives somewhat in the shadow of his brother and has a timid, shy streak, Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), the rebel of the group, and their friends. When they find that Mr. Keating was once in a mysterious club, called The Dead Poets Society, they decide to resurrect this club among themselves. This club, Mr. Keating, and their friendship arouse unknown talents and creativity from inside.<br/><br/>This movie was great in every possible way. Robin Williams once again showed us his versatility playing fun-loving but serious at heart John Keating. My personal favorite was Robert Sean Leonard, who perfectly displayed for this movie's audience the ambition and spirit that Neil had within, but which would immediately go into hiding when he'd be intimidated by his father. All of the teenagers were excellent in this movie.<br/><br/>The camera work was beautiful. The turns, the angles, everything just made you get into the story. The musical score had the same effect. Whatever emotion was supposed to be making up the scene, you felt it when that score was played.<br/><br/>This is Peter Weir's masterpiece at the moment. Truly a great film.

","Seeing this movie when it first came out, I must admit I didn't appreciate its complete value.  Then again, I was only 7. I recently bought this film and never tire of watching it.  This is possibly the best movie I have ever laid eyes on, and one that will never be forgotten, so long as I can help it. As an aspiring film critic and hopefully one day an English teacher as well, I feel that this film embodies the essence of what a teacher should and could be.  First and foremost, the teacher needs to be a mentor.  He or she must inspire and lead the scholars in their (often times reluctant) search of truths. The teacher's style must be different and unique.  I have seen too many great minds wasted in the public school system after teaching years and years of the same exact curriculum.  Finally, the teacher must be a friend and connect with his or her pupils on a level that will truly open their eyes and help them connect better with their world.  Not just with the literature, or the poetry, or the theatre, but also with their own thoughts and their own beliefs. Robin Williams does a magnificent job giving us this message, and I am still struggling over whether or not to show this movie in my future classes. His supporting cast is magnificent and I applaud each young man whole-heartedly.  This is a wonderfully wrought story and (almost ironically) gives myself and apparently many others a new insight into why they must live every day to its fullest extent."

In the course of a semester, I suppose a couple of extraordinary (...ahem) classes, in which the boys are told to stand on their desks, walk around the courtyard, etc, would not pose a problem...given that they spent the rest of the time reading, discussing, and perhaps writing poetry. We don't see much of that, though. ...why is it that Robin Williams always has to do a John Wayne impression? He does it here, he did it in Mrs. Doubtfire, and Good Morning Vietnam, and in The Birdcage. He's very good, of course, but...enough already.<br/><br/>The scenes in the cave...ridiculous?? Of course!

Thus, I recommend this movie to teachers, students, parents and anyone who is an authoritarian figure."

","The story Dead Poets Society was the one of the best movies I have ever seen. In the movie, especially, Robin Williams who plays Mr. Keating gave his students some comments,""Seize the day,"" and ""what is your verse in your life?""  that was very impressive part of this movie.  It gave me a strong passion what I want to do for my life as his students felt about.  I highly recommend this movie for every one who are very ordinary and do not know how to live efficiently. I guarantee that Dead Poets' Society will move and change you each time you watch it..."
"arice","10","0","1","4 April 2001"," The best movie about prep school to date.
","A lot has changed since the 1950s when this film takes place, but the movie captures the essence of prep school perfectly.  There great, innovative teachers like Mr. Keating and very traditional instructors who would slap you on the wrist if you made a mistake.  More importantly the attitude of the boys is right on in Peter Weir's film.  I go to a New England prep school and the way the kids act is dead on, from their pranks to exhibiting their intelligence in other ways such as quoting Whitman as their own stuff to impress some not so smart girls from the town.  ""Dead Poets"" also nails down the fact that prep school kids work their butts off at school, and the amounts of pressure put on some kids is astronomical.  Technically, Peter Weir's direction is excellent and the cinematography complements him well, but the real treasure of this movie is the acting from all the students especially Ethan Hawke.  And oh yeah Robin Williams gives the best performance of his career, hands down."

","Robin Williams can be effective as a dramatic actor, and this was<br/><br/>one of his best roles. I enjoyed the film, which  viewed as ""One<br/><br/>man can make a difference,"" Seize the day,"" ""Dare to defy,"" etc.,<br/><br/>etc., in its messages. <br/><br/>The main effect of the movie lies in the drama and character<br/><br/>interaction.

"WildBill-15","7","0","1","25 February 2001"," Not bad for ""coming of age"" film but desultory re poetry and pedagogy
","I agree with and cannot improve on many of the comments already posted: 1) superficial references to poetry undermine John Keating's supposedly transformative message, so that his instruction becomes messianic or charismatic rather than revelatory (BUT the chanting and marching while reciting ""The Congo"" seemed authentically musical and revealing of the poet's intentions);  2) sophomoric excesses undermined the authenticity of multiple issues, especially Neil Perry's relationship to his father (BUT Keating's interaction with Charlie Dalton after his realistic prank was a useful and effective exception);  3) failures to flesh out other students at Welton or students at other schools defaulted on definition of what made Keating's classes different, other than terrific impressions of Marlon Brando and John Wayne (BUT that certainly captures part of the entertainment culture in secondary and higher education TODAY, albeit perhaps not in 1962);  and 4) utterly false notes such as Mr. Cameron's craven speech to his comrades in the closet (BUT great scenes such as Neil's and Todd's conversing over the desk set partly redeem the film).<br/><br/>I am grateful for a previous poster's having posted the Robert Frost poem, for I believe that the use of that poem in the film by itself diagnoses a major flaw in the film's makers.  Please read the Frost poem carefully.  I believe that Frost unambiguously tells us that, RETROSPECTIVELY, we claim that we took a less popular path and that that choice explains our difference or betterness.  Frost carefully and repeatedly makes it clear that the two paths were almost indistinguishable.  Only when reviewed later and from a distance does the preferred road get redefined as ""striking out for new ground"" and other pretentious nonsense.  When I first watched the film, I was incensed when Keating retraced the popular misconception that Frost was advising his readers to dare the road less traveled by because that would make all the difference.  I found that part of the film doubly disappointing because Frost's important insight was distorted and because Keating, by restating the popular view, was violating his own advice.  At that moment, Keating made his students' and my lives quite ordinary!<br/><br/>I doubt that the screenwriter or director ever read the poem carefully. Indeed, I hope for their sakes that they did not.  Instead, they took the after-dinner speaker's misappropriation of Frost's poetry for the words that Frost selected.<br/><br/>For the reasons above and others, then, I concur that ""Dead Poets Society"" butchered poetry and the teaching of poetry (BUT I agree with Keating about the ""American Bandstand"" approach in the preface to the assigned text).<br/><br/>However, I also agree with commenters who laud the film as a coming of age film.  If one ""read"" DPS as the story of Todd Anderson (and, to a far lesser degree, Knox Overstreet), it would be a far better film.  Indeed, Todd likely remembers Mr. Keating for Todd's impromptu rap on Walt Whitman, sweaty teeth, and truth as an inadequate blanket.  Looking back, Todd may indeed see a road less traveled by.  That road's reward had far more to do with risk-taking, personalized instruction than with poetry.<br/><br/>In sum, this movie is nowhere near as bad as contrarians have asserted. It is nowhere near as good as admirers have claimed.  It is an incomplete accomplishment."
"Neuanda","10","0","1","16 November 1998"," This is the best movie ever made. Period.
","That is a very strong claim to make, and as you all can see (for those of you who HAVE seen this great film), I am so enamored of it that when DPS came out 9 1/2 years ago, I casually picked up the nickname ""Neuanda"" (chosen by one Charlie Dalton, a character in the film), and haven't let go of it since.<br/><br/>It is extremely important to tell all of you who have not seen this movie that your experience with DPS will not remotely mirror what I went through when I first encountered it.  Some of you will love it, some of you will loathe it, while others, still, will have mixed reactions.<br/><br/>And that is the beauty of it (and the beauty of moviedom, in general).<br/><br/>I was 15 years old and emotionally poised to receive a movie of this calliber.  I was young enough for it to become a part of my still malleable soul, and old enough to understand the gravity of its message .  I can only hope that something similar will happen for all of you who have yet to see it.  The movie's message is a simple one, but profound and enlightening, just the same.  Please take the 2+ hours to experience it, and relate it to your life the best way you know how.  That is all I can ask.<br/><br/>Carpe Diem and Enjoy."
