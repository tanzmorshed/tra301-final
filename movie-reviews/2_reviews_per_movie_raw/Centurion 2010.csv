"westenicho","6","360","429","23 January 2011"," Just to elaborate a bit...
","This movie was entertaining and exceeded expectations. I love history and am a history degree holder with an emphasis and ancient Indo European culture. I'm not here to tear into this movie as a I felt it was just fine, but rather try to deflect some ""junk"" history that some people seem to throw into the mixed reviews. Please, if you're going to try to add your own mish-mash of history, at least make sure it's correct.<br/><br/>That's right, I'm talking about you ""Russ-was-here"". Firstly, your review is off base on many levels, I'll try to answer some of those in a light hearted manner...<br/><br/>The fact that you consider Braveheart to be a ""factual"" representation of history is laughable, by this alone we can't take you seriously in your review of this movie. William Wallace wasn't running around the battlefield in a kilt, hate to break it to you.<br/><br/>You noted the wide variety of accents here. Is this shocking to you that actors from around the world took part in a movie, and that they all had different accents? The Pict language has been dead for quite some time, while there are rumors that the last confirmed speaker of Pict died in the 1950s, are we to expect the actors in this movie all speak ancient dialects of dead languages? get real (yes, that applies to Latin as well).<br/><br/>Perhaps your biggest mistake in assuming history of this movie is your statement: ""Then comes the fight scenes and complete absence of interesting Roman tactics, when attacked and flanked on a long narrow path they simply form a 1 man thick shield wall and wait..."" If you had actually studied Roman history (which I'm certain at this juncture you have not even cracked open a Tacitus or Pliny or Martial or any other Roman historian) then you would know the Battle of Teutoberg Wald quite well. In fact the battle that takes place in this movie is a near depiction of what the Germans did to the Romans when they destroyed 3 Roman legions while walking through the Black Forest. Ah yes, some of us actually DO study history. The Romans had no choice but to march nearly single file through a road, when they realized they were flanked on both sides (the line was 14 miles long, thus the battle took place over a 14 mile stretch) the Romans had no choice but to form up as best they could in the road. This proved devastating as it forced Romans to fight hand to hand combat against German soldiers who were more skilled in the area of hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>You mention that the Picts were known for their chariot warfare. Celts (Picts were a Celtic people) were well known for chariot warfare, as were many peoples in the Roman world, as you can see in this movie (especially the battle scene) using chariots would be quite a stupid move as they were in dense forest (use your brain, boy). As we can see with the final battle between Boudicca and Rome, using chariots was not always advantageous. In fact Boudicca sealed her army's fate by following an infantry charge with chariots (effectively crushing her infantry between Roman shields and Iceni chariots).<br/><br/>You also mention they fought naked. Indeed, many Indo Europeans fought in the buff, but that doesn't mean they all walked around in the buff all the time. They were dressed like Vikings you say? You have an odd preconceived notion of what the Vikings dressed like, personally I saw no Pict wearing chainmail (something Normans and Vikings were well known for). Furthermore it's a myth to believe that all Celts, Germans or any other Indo Europeans always fought naked. Many barbarian tribes were incredibly well equipped by 117AD as armor proved to be more and more of a necessity. We also see that Germanic and Celtic armor had a direct influence on Roman armor (Romans borrowed their helmet style from the Gauls for example). As for the movie? It's setting is in the winter, it would make no sense for Picts to be in the buff all the time. This is common sense.<br/><br/>Is this overkill? Yup. But I find your post to be (how did you put it?) completely devoid of historical facts. Does this movie have clichÃ©s of the time? Yup. Is the acting Oscar worthy? Probably not. Should we sit here and cry about it? nope. Just enjoy the movie. Nobody here is claiming this is a spitting image of 117AD in the northern UK (shocking, I know), but your post is ill informed and misleading.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is an entertaining movie and you certainly get the feel for the day. Engaging and exciting, certainly worth a view."
"hoopyfrude-1","10","308","378","13 February 2011"," Great film, badly reviewed.
","This is in direct response to davidfurlotte's fairly asinine 'review'.....<br/><br/>First of all, if you're going to claim to be an authority on these things, do some research. In practically every interview, Marshall made it very clear that the film was based on a myth, a legend, nothing more. He never once tried to claim that this was in any way a true story.<br/><br/>Also, where did you get that his Dad is a history professor?! He said his Dad loved history, and that's all. Again, do your research.<br/><br/>Finally, did you actually watch the battle? The Romans were stretched out in a long column for miles, surrounded on both sides. How do you move out of the way of fireballs when you've got men on both sides of you who are also trying to get out of the way of fireballs? You just end up with men piling into each other, utter chaos, and still achieving what the Picts intended in the first place, which was to break the Roman line. And since the Romans where back to back, if you did get out of the way, you're just allowing the fireballs to rolls into the backs of the troops defending the opposite flank. With that many fireballs coming in from both sides, into a densely packed column of Romans, there simply wasn't anywhere for them to go. The Romans were trained to hold the line. That's where their strength lay, in discipline and formation, and this is how the Picts (and the Germanic tribes) used their biggest strength against them.<br/><br/>The reason I defend this film is because I worked on it myself. And if it made a few mistakes along the way, like using the wrong kind of spears, I know it's because the budget was so tight they couldn't afford enough Pilum's for the number of troops they had. I know this sounds unbelievable, but it's absolutely true. This films entire budget was about the size of the costume department budget on Gladiator!<br/><br/>To make another simple comparison, on Braveheart they had 7 weeks to shoot just the Battle of Stirling. On Centurion we had 7 weeks to shoot the entire film, battles included. For the scene involving the fireballs, we had 3 days. So it's to be expected that through the almost constant barrage of compromise, a few factual mistakes may slip through the net. As filmmakers we do take exceptional pride in our work, and we'd love to have the time and the money to get everything absolutely perfect, but that's just not the reality of low budget filming in the UK. In the end, we do our best with what we've got."
"klam0500","7","94","131","27 April 2010"," Battles, Blood & Warrior Women....what's not to like?
","This is a straight forward tale of a band of Roman soldiers being hunted down by Pict warriors in the stunning surroundings of the Scottish mountains.<br/><br/>Whilst the dialogue and script won't exactly win any Oscars, the film was entertaining enough with plenty of blood & guts fighting scenes.<br/><br/>Olga Kurylenko was actually quite convincing in her portrayal of a brutal ice cold warrior, much better than Keira Knightley's portrayal of a female warrior in King Arthur. Perhaps Olga not having to utter a word in the entire film as she portrays a Pict who had her tongue cut out was a clever way to make her character more cold and mysterious.<br/><br/>I wouldn't quite go as far as one of the previous posters who describes the first major battle scene on a par with the opening scene in ""Gladiator"". Indeed some of the small criticisms I would level would be the use of very fast action shots during some of the fight scenes, i.e the camera motion is faster than your eye can register, think opening car chase in ""Quantom of Solace"" and you get the picture.<br/><br/>What really stands out in the film though is the stunning back drop of the Scottish mountains, It's like ""Highlander"" all over again only better!<br/><br/>Centurion, doesn't carry the ""epic"" status as other movies like ""Gladiator"",""Braveheart"" or ""Kingdom of heaven"", no it's on a much smaller scale and doesn't really spend too much time on character development on either the Pict or Roman sides. I suppose in a way it helps this film as it doesn't get bogged down in lengthy dialogue, but concentrates more on action.<br/><br/>Whilst this film won't score too highly on the originality stakes, it's a good effort in an all too neglected genre."
"dave-ranck","9","133","196","6 August 2010"," Surprisingly good tale
","I'm a fan of the culture and history of early Britain, so my opinion may be tainted a bit, but I really enjoyed this flick. It had a surprisingly good story and was not just a blood and guts war fest. It appears that the movie may be based on Rosemary Sutcliff's Book 'The Eagle of the Ninth', in which the Ninth Legion is wiped out in Scotland in AD 117. In any case, there is controversy and mystery as to what really happened to the 9th, and that makes a setting for a good tale. There is just enough history to make the story plausible, for example the creation of Hadrian's wall is depicted.<br/><br/>Neither side is portrayed as the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"", and to me, that brought a sense of realism with it. This is a bloody film, with heads rolling and a plethora of fighting, so don't bring the kiddies. I watched it On Demand, but I might go see it again in the theater."
"c-kelsall","10","224","347","27 April 2010"," Historical fiction doesn't get more exciting than this
","Centurion is a great film, and I suspect it's going to be totally underrated by the cinema-going public. I saw it at my local Odeon last night, the only cinema in town showing it, and I strongly suspect it won't be on next week. This is an example of a really good British film from a director with a strong pedigree not getting the kind of publicity and public interest that is frequently given to the most heinous rubbish that Hollywood can produce. Granted, many people don't share my director-centric view of forthcoming features; I'm prepared to risk getting my fingers burned occasionally in avidly chasing any films made by a select bunch of my favourite directors, but my approach is usually rewarded with excellence, like Centurion. In structure it is a very simple story, beautifully shot and honestly told. The bloody battles are very realistic - you get a good feel for what it might actually have been like to fight hand-to-hand in ancient times, frantic and deadly. The characters are simply drawn, and develop through their actions rather than words (quite literally in the case of Olga Kurylenko's ""Etain""). There is good and bad on both sides of the conflict, which is true to every war in human history. Ultimately, it offers a quite believable scenario to explain the mysterious historical disappearance of the 9th Legion in Hibernia."
"Troy_Campbell","8","121","183","30 July 2010"," A grubby, gory delight.
","When the final credits were rolling my regular cinema-going counterpart observed ""that was one of the most outwardly violent films I've seen since Kill Bill"". That's not far from the truth. Limbs are hacked clean off, stomachs are regularly impaled and the claret fluid sprays endlessly. Though the major difference is where Tarantino's homage to the old chop-socky movies from Eastern cinema is cartoonish in its bloody visuals, Centurion is anything but tongue-in-cheek; here the blood, sweat and tears seep into the muddy vistas and bucolic rivers of Great Britain to intensify the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Director Neil Marshall (The Descent) has crafted a gritty movie that at its core is a simple 'cat and mouse' tale â€“ and a highly entertaining one at that â€“ but becomes much more thanks to the efficacious work from all the cast and crew. Marshall himself executes a few impressive sequences, the most outstanding being the initial ambush on the Ninth Legion, showing once again he knows how to stretch a small budget with minimalistic techniques and a passionate approach. Director of photography Sam McCurdy provides a suitably grimy and grainy look that, although at times is too dim, sets the ideal tone for the film. Perhaps Marshall should have monitored the editing closer though, Chris Gill's frenetic cutting very nearly ruins a couple of the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Major Hollywood star in the waiting Michael Fassbender (played the German-impersonating British Lieutentant in Inglourious Basterds) is undoubtedly the standout among the acting contingent. As the titular soldier, Fassbender makes for a charismatic leading man that convinces in both the physical and dramatic elements of the role. I eagerly wait to see what he does as the young Magneto in the upcoming X-Men prequel. Elsewhere The Wire alumni Dominic West is rough around the edges as the gruff General Virilus, Olga Kurylenko is positively bad-ass as the mute, monomaniacal warrior hell-bent on revenge and BBC favourite David Morrisey adds clout in his supporting role of Bothos.<br/><br/>A grubby, gory delight.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
"ma-cortes","7","30","41","13 October 2014"," Features thrilling fighting scenes , violent battles and impressive production design
","Ultraviolent historical/epic/action yarn with breathtaking battles including lots of blood and gore . This is a nice as well as exciting production with a big budget , great sets and thundering battles during the Roman Empire . The picture deals with historical facts about confrontation between Romans and Picts . AD 117. The Roman Empire stretches from Egypt to Spain, and East as far as the Black Sea. But in northern Britain, the relentless onslaught of conquest has ground to a halt in face of the guerrilla tactics of an elusive enemy: the savage and terrifying Picts (they were generally thought to not have worn any clothes). A Roman army commanded by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) is besieged and deadly attacked . After that , splinter group of Roman soldiers led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) fight for their lives behind enemy lines after their legion is decimated in a devastating guerrilla attack . As they attempt to destroy their leader Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen) and face a desperate struggle to keep his small platoon alive . <br/><br/>Bloody version based on historical events with overwhelming battles and great production values starred by Michael Fassbender as the fictional Centurion , leader of a motley crew of tough , battle-hardened warriors/underdogs who try to defend themselves against a patrol of bloody Picts led by a brutal warrior woman . The movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , thrills , a little bit of romance and is pretty entertaining . Although is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action in a dirty , gritty Roman Empire during its period in Britain . Several action scenes are outstanding with spectacular battle images and thrilling fights . Unfortunately, on small house screens much of the splendor will be lost . As the movie makes a big deal out of the supposedly deathly rivalry between Romans and the Picts . German archaeologists have found evidence of the 9th Legion on the banks of the Rhine River and carbon-dated them long after these events took place, suggesting that rather than being wiped out, the reason that there is no evidence of the 9th Legion being in Scotland after these battles is that they moved to Germany . The working title for the film was ""Ninth Legion"" , the story goes that the Ninth Legion marched to Scotland from York with 3000 men and were never seen of again. Historians dispute what actually happened to them. Some believe that they were disbanded, while others believe that they were massacred . <br/><br/>Stunning battles scenes illuminate the full-blown feats with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there . Casting is frankly excellent such as Liam Cunningham , Dominic Cooper , David Morrissey , Ulrich Thomsen , Imogen Poots and Paul Freeman and Governor Julius Agricola . Special mention to treacherous , despised role played by Olga Kurylenko as sadistic , revenger Etain . There are great action sequences including the gory battle in woods and the final confrontation at the climax of the film . Impeccable and evocative cinematography by Sam McCurdy . Filmmaker and his director of photography Sam McCurdy spent about two years discussing the look of the film before making it , one thing they were adamant about was that it should be shot on location and nowhere near a green screen. Magnificent and stirring musical score by Ilan Eshkeri . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Neil Marshall (Doomsday , Descent , Dog soldiers). Neil Marshall shot the film in such hard conditions that some cast members suffered health problems . One of Neil Marshall's influences was Walter Hill's The warriors (1979) , this is why Hill is thanked in the end credits . Rating : Good, it's a nice historical extravaganza well set in ancient Rome , done in great scale and praised for its action sequences."
"rum2550","7","54","80","17 January 2011"," One of the best in its genre
","This movie was relatively unheard of when a friend of mine gave a copy of it. I was skeptical since it was not from Hollywood, no big stars etc. However, it proved I was wrong. This is not a masterpiece indeed; but it was able to get me a thrilling ride from beginning to end. To make it short, I would say this is a combination of ""BEHIND ENEMY LINES"" scenario at the pace and editing of ""BOURNE ULTIMATUM"" set at the backdrop of ""KING ARTHUR"". It's true that script does not focus much on character development but it does not cause any trouble in enjoying this action-adventure. As one reviewer has mentioned, I agree that portrayal of a female warrior by Olga Kurylenko is much more realistic and successful than the similar role played by Keira knightly in ""King Arthur"". It is really sad that movies like this are not given adequate publicity since this is much better than most big budget Hollywood movies that are being hyped inappropriately."
"Siamois","6","52","78","24 August 2010"," Playing cat and mouse with the Picts
","A group of Roman soldiers who survived an ambush are chased relentlessly by a hunting party of Picts. As with every other movie by Neil Marshall (The Descent, Doomsday) this big screen epic attempts to mix the grittiness of European filmmaking with the entertainment values of Hollywood movie-making. And as is becoming signature with this director, Centurion pursues his tradition to feature very strong and memorable female characters. <br/><br/>While it is Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) who is the protagonist as the somewhat reluctant leader of our heroes, the most memorable character on screen is Etain, a Brigantian tracker played by Olga Kurylenko. Etain's tribe was massacred by the Romans and she took refuge with the Picts. Her backstory is a powerful device that explains all the hatred she has for Romans and the length she will go to exact revenge. Neil Marshall makes great use of actress Kurylenko and she literally eats the screen in almost every scene she is in, despite her character being mute. Etain reaches iconic status as far as I'm concerned, much like Karl Vreski (Die Hard).<br/><br/>The actual plot, despite its historical context, is less Gladiator and more Apocalypto. Several battles are extremely gritty, entering gory territory as blood flows. There are a lot of CGI sequences mixed with traditional effects but they do not detract from the experience too much. Quintus' bunch of survivors are portrayed by a group of effective actors but the movie's short length prevents much characterization. Where Marshall is more effective is in the portrayal of the Picts. In very few words, several characters stand out throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Everything is fairly entertaining but the movie never quite reaches classic epic status due to its short length and several incongruities. For instance, I still don't understand why two healthy and armed soldiers would run away from wolves, nor why wolves would pursue them (that simply flies in the face of anything we know about the behavior of wolves). Etain is also ordered to severe the heads of the men she is chasing but conveniently omits certain characters so that they survive their injuries, which makes no sense and is transparent bad writing. Likewise, when the Romans have a chance to steal or kill the Picts' horses, they simply ignore this opportunity. These plot holes add up pretty fast and detract from our experience, turning what could have been a classic into just a great pop corn flick.<br/><br/>But an entertaining pop corn flick it is, despite its faults! I wish Marshall would be slightly less ambitious, as it seems he is at his best working on smaller scale movies but he still has a knack to shoot fun films and create engaging characters. Special kudos for not glorifying the Roman empire and especially, for not portraying the Picts as clear-cut villains. Although the structure of the film firmly puts the Picts in the ""baddies"" slot, there are several hints and a lot of subtext that, on the contrary, showcases the Roman empire as bloodthirsty invaders, plotting backstabbers and savages themselves. <br/><br/>Every amateur of sword epic will want to see this one at least once, possibly several times."
"hitchcockthelegend","5","49","78","26 September 2010"," Are you not entertained?
","Centurion is directed by Neil Marshall who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Dominic West, Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Riz Ahmed & Imogen Poots.<br/><br/>Britain, 117 AD and the Romans are struggling to contain the Picts in Caledonia. The Roman Governor sends in their best army, the Ninth Legion. But they are victims of a trap and are forced to flee on foot across the mountainous terrain with the vengeful Picts in hot pursuit. Can they stay alive and make it to the border?<br/><br/>One thing you know you are going to get with a Neil Marshall film is blood and guts. Be it squadies facing off against werewolves, pot-holing babes grappling with hungry Gollum types, or a secret unit sent in to quarantined Scotland to fend off cannibal punk rockers; Marshall likes to pile on the grue. With his latest, Centurion, he continues in this vein. Sadly that's about all there is as the talented director appears to be getting a little carried away with himself and forgetting to put some substance into his characters. What promises to be a telling historical epic anti-war movie ends up being one long chase movie. Only pausing for breath for intermittent blood letting and the now obligatory love interest sub-plot. Oh it's fun, very much so, and the visuals coupled with the excellently constructed fight sequences don't waste a penny spent. But as a whole it just doesn't work, it's more a collection of set pieces linked together by visceral pleasures under the guise of being a take on a folklore story.<br/><br/>However, there is no denying the commitment to the genre from Marshall. Centurion is often thrilling and brutal into the bargain, so as long as you don't require any semblance of depth then it will surely entertain you. While he has assembled a very admirable cast of British & Irish thesps and put them thru a very tough shoot up in the Scottish hills. The craft is there, from director and stars, just no decent script to flesh it out. Oh and do we really need Roman soldiers saying the F word to show us how hard they are? Coming after Doomsday flopped (personally I think it's a whole bunch of fun), Marshall is at the crossroads of his career. Once the indie darling of Britain he's been courted by Hollywood and needs to make big decisions. You can only homage so much in your favoured genres (here he nods to Gladiator, The Warriors and even Zulu) before it gets to be boring. So is it time to let someone else write now? Also if he must stay mainstream then he has to get the budget to do the job properly; witness the digital blood used for the first fight sequences, laughably bad and able to take you right out of the film.<br/><br/>At times ridiculous and over the top, Centurion only works well as a pure action flick. Which of course will find an audience. But director and cast are better than this, as an effective story is bogged down by lack of narrative heart that in turn is most likely hidden by arterial blood. Lots of it. 5/10"

","A small group of Roman soldiers are left alive after an attack on their legion. They must survive the elements and an expert tracker coming after them. Behind enemy lines and fighting for the lives. <br/><br/>With Centurion, Neil Marshall has his biggest budget to date. The film is ambitious in style and tone. Marshall, who get a cult following after two excellent small horror films (Dog Soldiers and Descent) has gone on to bigger, but not really better things. Doomsday was a nice throwback to genre films (even though it didn't really know which one it wanted to be) and now Centurion, which has Marshall tipping his hat to Gladiator and Spartacus. <br/><br/>I consider myself a Marshall fan, which is why I even bothered to give this film a viewing. If his name weren't attached, I wouldn't have bothered. Marshall is apart of the Splat-Pack. The horror coined group for filmmakers like Rob Zombie and Eli Roth. It's no question as to why Marshall is apart of this group, every film of his has some body part ending up some place. It's funny to me that this film might be his most gruesome one yet and it isn't even horror.<br/><br/>The film's most gruesome moments are during the big attack on the romans. Arrows are shot into heads, arms, legs and necks are taken out like a hot knife through butter. I had a few moments where I was actually shocked at the carnage on the screen. One of the more gruesome period pieces. During the attack, the Picts (Scottish) take prisoner the General (Dominic West). The small group of survivors, including Michael Fassbender decide to try and get him back. They fail, but they did succeed in killing the lead Pict's son. He sends a group of people to go after them, thus we have a cat and mouse chase throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's suspenseful in places and aggravating in others. The lead tracker, is suppose to have excellent skills, where she is always on their tail, no matter what. Yet the filmmakers seem to forget this sometimes. She can sense them across the river in one scene, but not underneath her feet in another. These inconsistencies are bothersome. Yet it happens. The characters themselves aren't too memorable either. I couldn't really tell the survivors apart from one another and neither stood out of the crowd. These shortcomings in the script are what bring Centurion down. The most interesting character is killed off too early too.<br/><br/>Yet, Marshall still manages to deliver an entertaining film. It's not near the level of awesome that is Dog Soldiers, or even The Descent, but it does deliver what you would expect from this genre. There are moments where the film loses its sense of direction (such as a lover subplot) and there are even moments of predictability, but as a whole, the film delivers."
"mitchel_vaneeden","4","87","155","14 August 2010"," Too much flaws make this movie not that good
","This is my first review on IMDb. I normally read IMDb movie reviews with great interest, but for this movie I felt that I needed to wright one myself. Although this review contains spoilers and is intended for people who already saw this movie, for those of you who haven't seen this one yet, you might consider reading some of the more critical reviews like this one before making your decision.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of most historical adventure/action movies, and I've seen quite a few. This one tries to be different, but not in a good way. Some things bothered my and did not make sense to me at all, and i'd like to share some of them with you.<br/><br/>First, the action scenes really show the influence of director Neil Marshall (The Descent) with way too much blood and gore relative to the story. I know it might be realistic for battles these days, but it doesn't really add anything to the story.<br/><br/>Second, some plot developments really doesn't make any sense. The first scene in which the Romans are attacked by the Picts, why the hell do they leave Quintus Dias (Fassbender) alive? Because he speaks their language? It did not and does not make sense to me at all.<br/><br/>Third, the introduction of Etain (Kurylenko) is way too short. Who is she? Why is she in the Roman camp? Why can we trust her? We don't know, although the more intelligent viewer might conclude after one minute screen time that she might betray our Roman friends. Surprise! She does...<br/><br/>Fourth, it might be a minor bug but it sure is one for me! When the small group of Romans is attacked by the Picts after being chased 90% of the movie (see next point), they kill the junior scout (don't know actors name) with a spear through his mouth. Then they decapitate him, following the orders of Gorlacon who demanded the heads of our Roman friends after one of them killed his son. While the junior scout is decapitated, Brick is shot in the leg with an arrow. Instead of killing and decapitating him (which would make sense!!) one of the Picts says: ''let him bleed to death''. What the *****. You chase these guys for miles and hours, finally catch them and...one arrow in the leg and bleeding to death is suddenly good enough???<br/><br/>Fifht, the biggest fail in this movie for me is actually the whole plot. Why, after a small war against the Picts which the Picts won by killing a thousand Romans and capturing the general, would you think, would you assume, that a battered group of Romans can infiltrate the Pict camp and release the general. OK, something to do with loyalty, whatever. So they go to the camp, somehow manage to get to the general which, in theory, is impossible, but they can't release him??? OK, must have been some very well constructed metal chain. So they decide to go back (Picts are coming back to camp) but not before one of them kills Gorlacons son. This results in Gorlacon wanting the heads of these Romans. That's not good, not only for the Romans but for the viewers as well. Why? Because the movie transforms into one big chase (of which you know the outcome already at the beginning) in which Etain is some supernatural creature who can track people down in area's of hundreds of square miles. Whatever...After this boring as hell part, the most misplaced subplot I've seen in a long time makes this movie even weaker. One beautiful woman, who happens to live on her own, falls in love with our brave protagonist. Why does she live there? Who is she? Why isn't she dead? Why do these scenes take so ******* long?? And the big question: will our brave Roman see her again (seriously? I mean....oh common!!!!)<br/><br/>So, these things really ruined this movie for me. A weak movie, which tries to be something it fails to be. I hope people who read this review might agree with some elements in my review (although I respect everyones opinion, even the ones who make this movie an oscarwinner). And I specifically hope that those of you who did not see this movie yet, choose a different one. This one will bore you, makes you frustrated and finally makes you bored again."
"DICK STEEL","6","45","78","2 April 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Centurion
","I'd admit that the films of Neil Marshall's have been quite right up my alley, with a mishmash of genres all done with an excessively violent treatment, but it does go to show that relying too much on the usual will bring forth a stale feeling, that Marshall may not have anything more to offer other than to pepper his films with plenty of hacked limbs in a straight forward action adventure<br/><br/>Set in 117AD, Neil Marshall's story pits the Roman empire against the guerrilla Picts, who have halted the Roman invasion so much so that Rome decides on a last push. To the organized troops of Roman centurions, the Picts with their unorthodox techniques have the upper hand in a David and Goliath pattern, that it's up to Dominic West's General Virilus to lead an army, and with the help of Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) who has escaped from the Picts, to show them the way. That sets the premise of an otherwise ordinary film that's focused on its battle sequences, and has a very simple, two phase narrative to waltz through.<br/><br/>One of the draws here is of course Michael Fassbender's presence. Of 300 and Eden Lake fame, he brings forth a sense of vulnerability to a warrior's role, bent on trying to keep alive than to go all out to kill. He leads Virilus' surviving men of 6 to a rescue mission, before turning tails and having the next half of the film centered on their escape back to safe haven, all the while being tracked by Olga Kurylenko's Etain, a mute Pict scout who's an excellent tracker.<br/><br/>In some ways, the story had resembled like a distant cousin of the magnificent seven, where a rag tag team of surviving Roman centurions get cobbled together for a mission to rescue their beloved General. And I mean really rag tag since they have a cook amongst their ranks. It's an offensive maneuver first, before going all defensive because of the lack of skills, and numerical advantage and savagery that the Picts pose. Olga Kurylenko chews up her scenes even as she's more clothed than her previous films, and gets plenty of physical action (with weapons that is) to show she's no pushover for action sequences.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, a last minute romantic subplot gets thrown in which sort of spoils the film because it firmly roots itself as a finale plot development point, leaving little surprise for its hurried ending since you know just where and how the film would end. Like a typical Marshall film, there are tons of carefully crafted scenes that are bloody violent, such as smashing someone's head to a pulp against a tree or a full on ugly beheading. There's only one sequence that will stand out in the entire film, and that's a massive ambush against a full battalion of Roman soldiers, which is one-off and the only one done on grand scale, setting the scene for plenty of screen violence with unflinching decapitations of miscellaneous body parts.<br/><br/>Fans will find this an enjoyable action adventure, but it doesn't offer anything much nor new to win over new fans."

","Unlike the big-budget disappointment of 'Clash of the Titans', 'Centurion' is rather low-key, with no real big name stars or any 3D gimmicks. Fortunately, 'Centurion' is everything 'Clash of the Titans' should have been. There's an interesting quest story, atmospheric mise-en-scene and â€“ more importantly â€“ plenty of blood-and-guts action. This is not your Hollywood sword-and-sandals movie, polished within an inch of its life and designed to please everyone.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly straightforward. Quintus Dias (the brilliant Michael Fassbender) is the lone survivor of a raid from the savage Picts, based in northern Britain. Dias marches with the ninth legion, led by General Virilus (Dominic West) to eliminate the Picts. When the legion is ambushed and Virilus is taken captive, it's up to Dias and a small band of soldiers to rescue Virilus, defeat the Picts and return to the Roman frontier.<br/><br/>The spectacular violence is the highlight of the film. This is not for the squeamish, as blood flows from the opening battle and doesn't stop until the end: there's decapitated limbs, beheadings and lots of throat slitting. While there's plenty of violence, it never ventures into ""gore porn"" territory. The fight scenes are edited so quickly that sometimes it's hard to pick up who's killing who in the mess of bodies. As a viewer, it's best to just sit back and watch the carnage, which certainly earns its MA rating (with a bit of swearing thrown in).<br/><br/>Probably the most brutal is Pict warrior Etain (Olga Kurylenko), who has an almost animalistic ability to track enemies. While â€“ due to her character being mute - Kurylenko has no dialogue, she makes up for it by matching it blow-for-blow with the male characters. Like most films of this nature, there is a romantic sub-plot, between Dias and Arian(Imogen Poots), a Pict witch who has been doomed to a life of solitude and briefly houses Dias and his soldiers. Fortunately, the romantic sub-plot is only really hinted at and isn't there just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Though the mise-en-scene is quite murky, this adds to the film's atmosphere and helps to draw you into the story, as well as providing a stark contrast to all the blood. The score is quite unobtrusive - the only times you really notice it is in the quieter scenes, which helps establish the relationship between Dias and his soldiers, often punctuated with dark humour. <br/><br/>If you like films with plenty of violence, then sit back, and enjoy the ride of 'Centurion'."

","I never thought about it before, and actually this movie helped me to understand something. When you go to see a movie you want to have some satisfaction, and mostly you get it when you sympathize with the hero, you get emotionally involved in their problems and you worry about them.<br/><br/>Here, you have two sides and I personally can not empathize with any of them.<br/><br/>The Picts, while they have a right to protect their land and families, are shown in quite cruel way and Olga Kirylenko's character is far from being attractive.<br/><br/>On the other side the Centurion and his soldiers are nothing but invaders killing and enslaving the locals just for the sake of glory of the Roman Empire. All in all, it's fair for them to be killed by the people they are oppressing and I can't really worry about the Centurion trying to survive because I feel more like he deserves to die for what he's done. If you are a professional soldier and came to a foreign land to ravage it... well, you get what you get.<br/><br/>This movie looks like a historical documentary, which shows you some facts and reasons/motives of both sides to do what they do or have to.<br/><br/>It's done fairly well, but for me it defeats the main purpose of movie - it's not entertaining. There is no point of attraction in it, there is no one to feel for, and I expect quite the opposite when I'm paying for the ticket."

","I can't believe people are praising so high this film, the best film Marshall has ever done was The Descent, then he made Doomsday, which doesn't get any near a good science fiction movie, actually copying some of the greatest of all times, then this Centurion which mixes Gladiator and King Artur, creating some kind of gore b movie, with nothing special to hold on, i mean, you can only like this movie if you really are into gore, the argument is one of the worst i ever seen, the mistakes are so bad in this one, OK here goes the spoiler, they're running away of some trackers, and the centurion leaves the general helmet's behind?!!! wtf! the love story is so out of context, and the witch is so beautiful, like a model, that you can hardly understand how she's living alone, and hasn't been raped or been made wife of some leader, not to mention the fact that she looks like she's been living in an hotel for the last couple of years with that make up?! it's completely dumb! then the warriors that are afraid of wolfs?!! they could go up in a tree but no, they run like ladies in distress, and the mere fact that wolfs are afraid of men makes it even more stupid, they don't come out in the open like that. it's just keeps getting stupider and stupider the movie, near the end one of the warriors goes running to the fort, screaming like a woman, with his arms up, when there was no danger, nothing special for that crazy behavior, and get's shot, if the behavior is nonsensical the shooting of the warrior is even more, so a sentinel in his post see's someone approaching alone, with no weapon in sight, screaming in their language, and he just kills him without even seeing if he's friend or foe, great! this one is to be avoid, but the worst is the emotional acting that they want to give to this film, let's face it, this movie is not historical, it doesn't have good acting, it's just another clone of an adventure war movie, it looks like nobody learned anything with Braveheart, it's a shame for the cinema of today."

","I give Centurion 2 points for the beauty of the landscapes. The rest of the movie is rubbish. It's not as bad as ""King Arthur"" - which was dire, but...where was the story? Where was the characterization? Where was anything at all? So much great material and nothing satisfying done with it. The Picts. I mean, the Picts! What a great source for a movie, but what was done with it? ClichÃ©, clichÃ© and more clichÃ©; the number one rule of story telling: avoid clichÃ©, but this we are given in bucket loads. Could have been a great historical movie of the clash of cultures; but all we got was clichÃ©d crap. Ridiculous warrior women who slaughter well-trained Roman generals and their soldiers: patronizing and stupid, so PC and so clichÃ©d these days. And the beautiful bint who lives alone in a hut; so beautiful she should be on the cover of Vogue, living alone in 117AD as a 'witch'? Oh, please, when will movie-makers ever do anything different, original and true to history? I've lost it when it comes to truth in historical movies...do movie makers truly believe their audiences want to be layered with clichÃ© and corny love stories that go nowhere, and come from nowhere, and are just not needed? DO they think we're all so shallow that all we really want in a movie is pap and the token tart to scrub up the filthy men? I LOVE filthy men and I don't need the token tart with the batting eyelids to make it good for me. It's good for me when the token tart isn't there at all, or if she is, she's more true to life than the scrubbed-up flossy babe who doesn't even have any dirt on her face or on her hands. <br/><br/>But still, as everyone else has posted about ""Centurion"" in plot summaries, I will here just say a few historical things about it instead: Firstly, The Picts were NOT SCOTS, OK guy who made this movie? The Picts were British Celts who spoke a dialect of Brythonic; British P-Celtic, related to Welsh. Didn't you do any historical research before you made this film, film-maker guy? What, you didn't! You make a movie and didn't even bother to check out who these people were in real life? You just went along with everyone else and played them as downtrodden Scots to raise the emotional level in the same way that Mel Gibson did in that hideous mess of a movie, Braveheart? (The Scots of William Wallace's time did not run around in kilts with blue painted faces, Gibbo, they wore armour just like their English enemies...sheesh...)<br/><br/>Agricola was NOT governor of Britain in those days; he had died long before 117AD. It was some other dude whose name I cannot now remember. Hadrian's Wall wasn't there then, or even being built. Hadrian's Wall was begun in 122AD, not 117AD. And one last thing, the Ninth legion did not disappear in mysterious circumstances or get wiped out by Celtic Picts or other Celtic peoples; that is a MYTH. Legio IX Hispana was reported alive and well in Europe, the Netherlands, I think it was, in following years after 117AD. <br/><br/>Just enjoy this movie's scenery. It is NOT Gladiator. It just looks nice."

","In general I have been pretty impressed by Neil Marshall's movies. They play to what I see as his strengths as a director, small ensemble group of character actors battling with extreme circumstances (often violent), fast and furious action, satisfying conclusion. As I assess this movie there was every chance that he was going to do this again in a Roman vs Pict battle for survival story. Small band of soldiers, stuck behind 'enemy lines' racing to get back to safety. At first I wasn't sure that the contemporary language and accents was going to work for me - I've no idea what Roman vernacular might have been but 21st Century Brit-speak takes a bit of a leap of faith. However as the action picked up and the plot unfolded I started to get into the fast pace of the whole thing and was really enjoying the 'rush for the line pursued by uber tracker bitch with a sense for her prey' storyline. Then what happens! Suddenly out of nowhere we have love interest - 'vogueish' not 'pict-ish'and the previous set up goes out of the window. Said super hunter inexplicably can't find Romans when they are virtually sitting in her lap. The pace completely slackens off and the edginess that was build up before is gone. What was Marshall thinking of? Of course I blame the production company or distributors or some such ninnies who I assume said to good ol' Neil, ""Bigger production, bigger budget than you're used to....must have a love story to get a decent return on our investment."" That, or, NM just out of his comfort genre. Who knows but a lost opportunity this time round."
"Theo Robertson","6","16","28","2 December 2012"," Gory Historical Adventure
","Neil Marshall seems an odd choice for this type of movie . An established horror director isn't the first person you'd think of when choosing a director to make a historical adventure featuring ancient Rome in their battle to tame the Picts . That said he knows Scotland very well since his previous films DOG SOLDIERS and DOOMSDAY were both set there even if they were filmed in Luxumberg and South Africa respectively . At least the Scotland here resembles the gloomy bleak landscape seen in Winter <br/><br/>From the outset Marshall shows his genre roots by making CENTURION as violent as possible . I saw this on the same day as I saw the last RAMBO movie and there's not a world of difference between the two movies where violence is concerned , people are decapitated and disemboweled and rivers run red with blood . If there's a problem it's as in his other films Marshall shows a slight problem with pacing . When characters sit down and talk you find yourself hoping for a bit more character interaction but this rug is pulled from under the audiences feet and we're back to a bloody set-piece regardless if it's needed or not . I had hoped for a little bit more conversation and a little bit less action please . If someone makes a bio-pic on Elvis then Neil Marshall will not be that director. That said films such as THE NAKED PREY and APOCALYPTO don't have much in the way of conversation either <br/><br/>I'll say one thing in favour of the director and that is he's able to make a film where the British Isles have been invaded and the modern day British audience are still able to empathise with the invaders to an extent . Neither side is painted in black and white and the Romans are helped by the fact that they're played by a likable cast . One possibly might suggest that there's a subtext on Afghanistan going on here somewhere . By this I mean an all conquering super power finding itself unable to decisively beat an indigenous population . In fact the infamous line about Afghanistan being "" The grave yard of empires "" is almost spoken in relation to the Picts<br/><br/>And that's perhaps the underlying fundamental problem with CENTURION . It's a film that could be somewhat more cerebral and character driven but has sacrificed this in order to be a violent historical action adventure that doesn't let up . It's a good film but perhaps should have been an even better one regardless of the budget"

","This is a film I can watch again and again. A good fast pace, characters you can care about, and fantastic scenery, beautifully filmed. Having some military experience I thought the 'gung-ho' mindset (and foul language) of the troops was plausible. The Roman Army was a brutal killing machine in it's time, and they had enormous self-belief. I think that is reflected well by the characters, particularly by Fassbender's Centurion character. He is a political fanatic, devoted to his nation/ cause. You could put him in a Soviet or German uniform in WW2 quite easily. Yet somehow, his humanity survives beneath the exterior. The film combines the historical/ war genre with the chase/ survival genre, mixed with military camaraderie and even a love angle. I recommend this film.

","A director who has some cult success with a cheap Brit horror turns to Roman history in Britannia. Is it a parable for Iraq or Afghanistan? Well, the Russian involvement maybe, but it's a cheap easy way to show a lot of blood being spilt in many differing, and often, horrific ways. No, it's not about Romans or Picts - although it's probably closer to the war Severus waged on the Picts and Caledonians around 205 AD - it's just a chase movie, with the chased getting killed at regular intervals. Presumably just like 'The Descent' even though I haven't seen it. Critics have obviously praised Director Marshall's early work for having a bit about it, and just like Tarantino after one so so movie, they cannot go back and say that he's got nothing to say and his latest movie is crap. Michael Fassbender, praised to high heaven for his portrayal of Bobby Sands, is anonymous here playing a conventional role - more disappointment for the critics. No the lost legion - the 9th Hispana - deserved better than this absolute pile of excrement.

","Centurion is another way underrated film from one of my favorite directors Neil Marshall. This time around it is a Roman period action movie based around the myths of the disappearance of The 9th Roman Legion in The British Isles and what could have possibly happened. Taken from the point of view of a Roman soldier and is a wonderful early performance( from now acclaimed actor) Michael Fassbender. Fassbender is in top physical condition and along with the rest of the cast truly earns his pay in this grueling, physical role. In a time of fake digital effects and seizure inducing cgi, Neil Marshall takes his cast and crew to the mountains and shoots on location in the blistering cold. In the opening scene we see our hero Michael Fassbender running shirtless through a violent snowstorm, which sums up the tone of the film early on. Although similar to Gladiator in many ways, this is much smaller scale and more action packed as well. The battle scenes are very bloody and brutal with lots of gory dismemberments and decapitations. Heads roll and body parts fly in a brutal gory fashion in this period action classic. The acting is quite good as well and the film is very, very gritty. This has a similar feel to John Carpenter's work, I see a big nod to him here. I see some similarities to Assault On Precinct 13 and Ghosts Of Mars in particular. Centurion gives a good glimpse into barbaric times and in my opinion is much better than a lot of much more hyped films that get heaped with praise."

"Simon_Says_Movies","7","8","15","26 August 2010"," Carves out its own gory slice of guilty pleasure pie
","Neil Marshall's bloody medieval chase flick could very easily be dubbed ""King Arthur: the prequel."" The 2004 Clive Owen-feautring King Arthur origin tale essentially picks up where this film ends with the building of Hadrian's Wall, the ancient Roman fortification that stretched across what is now Northern England. Both films follow a small band of Roman centurion soldiers battling against the native warriors. Though similar in setting and tone, Centurion carves out its own gory slice of guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Despite what is still a giddy action romp, Centurion continues to highlight Neil Marshall's slide from his one-two punch horror debut with Dog Soldiers and The Descent. His very latest effort was the deliciously over-the-top apocalyptic throwback Doomsday, but I still hold hope that he can break free of this B-movie mold and recapture the spark that made him somewhat of an icon amongst horror fans. What continues to shine through in Marshall's films is his prowess. The man knows how to shoot an action sequence and mounts the proceedings against stunning cinematography. He seems to understand that just because your movie employs schlocky subject matter doesn't mean it has to look cheap.<br/><br/>Centurion is not your typical Gladiator-style epic offering, but is more or less a chase film in the vein of a traditional slasher film with an unrelenting force stalking its frantic prey. The threat exists in the form of The Picts, a Scottish tribe bent on repelling their Roman invaders. After a Pict attack on a remote Roman outpost, Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) finds himself in captivity as the lone survivor. Escaping, he meets up with the Ninth Legion lead by the brash but beloved General Virilus (Dominic West). The Legion is immediately deployed into action and it is déjà vu for Dias as the legion is devastated in a guerrilla attack set up by the mute double agent Etain (Olga Kurylenko). It is then up to a small band of survivors including the general and Dias to make it back to the Roman lines.<br/><br/>Apart from the glossy production values, the biggest assets in Centurion are the performances by West and Fassbender. They ground the film amongst the gushing blood and dangling limbs, simultaneously propelling themselves further as ever-rising stars. Kurylenko has somewhat of a thankless role as the fierce warrior-woman but she makes the most of her lineless screen time. What I find odd about films set in this time and place, is the Roman's are always portrayed as the heroes when in fact they are the ones invading the Celtic homeland. It would be refreshing to see a similar style film from the point of view of the native inhabitants.<br/><br/>Centurion has a lot going for it in terms of pure fun, but is certainly lacking in substance and an even tone. Marshall has also opted to shoehorn in a love story involving Dias and an exiled Pict which stands as a stark contrast to the gritty mayhem that perforates most of the narrative. Qualms aside, you could do worse than this straightforward but manic ancient action flick and looking at the movie year at large, Centurion looks better at every crimson-soaked visit."
"webmaster-3017","6","10","20","15 August 2010"," HK Neo Reviews: Centurion
","A brutal ancient actioner...<br/><br/>The film pans out exactly as the trailer, offers nothing new, done to death story, but somehow, this brutal portrayal of the Romans battling for survival against the tribes of forestry is exciting enough for the entire duration. Save for a letdown in the formula romantic subplot, the film serves the audience well, with an efficient actioner that offers nothing special, nothing new and nothing memorable.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender leads a cast of non-Hollywood heavy weights. Fassbender makes a charismatic hero to follow, while offering nothing ingenious in terms of acting; he is suitably capable as a leader of the magnificent seven. The highlight and eye candy comes in the form of former Bond girl, Olga Kurylenko, who displays some meaty acting chops by being outright nasty. Perhaps aided by being a mute, Olga is great and if she shed a few more of those cloths on her, it will be even greater. Shame it didn't happen, but she is certainly one very hot heroine.<br/><br/>All in all, Centurion delivers action, action, blood, blood, violence, violence and absolute brutality. For that it entertained me from start to finish. Yes, I am a casual ancient historian, but if you discount the factor of any historical accuracy and embrace the film as a fiction or even a fantasy.

"seale9","8","13","28","10 August 2010"," A tense, tough, and entertaining tale of Romans at war
","Just finished watching ""Centurion"" on Comcast Video On Demand. First time I ever paid for a VOD flick. Score one for modern technology. ""Centurion"" is a sword and sandal version of an old fashioned war film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know Neil Marshall's last outing disappointed some critics and fans, but this one was am expertly crafted crowd pleaser that delivers the goods. It's a lean, mean and and seldom slackens the pace. The plot is centered on a group of Roman soldiers trying to elude some Pictish pursuers and make it back to Hadrian's Wall. For that reason, it reminded me of those low budget Korean War movies that Hollywood cranked out in the 1950's. Most of them were slow-paced depictions of a retreating platoon or squad cut off from their own lines. Marshall even gave his Romans a multi-cultural makeup that would have pleased Howard Hawks or William Welllman. In the old days the American unit always had a slow talking Texan, a tough kid from Brooklyn, a farm boy from Iowa, etc. Marshall's Roman cohort includes a Syrian, an African, a Tuscan farmer, a Greek, and the oddly clean cut son of a Roman gladiator. Hey, fine by me. I'm a big believer in film traditions.<br/><br/>Marshall wrote the script and it was plain to see he is a film buff, as he borrowed bits from a number of earlier films like ""Butch Cassidy,"" ""Last of the Mohicans,"" ""Naked Prey,"" and others. Nothing wrong with that. Everybody does it and Marshall has tossed together an admirable mix of familiar, but revered, action set pieces served up with the frantic pace, CGI bloodletting, and super-model Amazons to appeal to modern audiences. The aerial photography of the Scotish highlands was wonderful and really gave the film a more epic scope. The major battle scene early in the film is first rate, though Marsahll lifted the rolling fireballs from Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus."" The obligatory CGI blood sprays were there, but nothing like the crimson tidal waves of ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand."" I am not, however, a big fan of computerized frame blending to heighten the intensity of the action scenes. Seems artificial to me, but I am sure others are fine with it.<br/><br/>Like all cat-and-mouse chase films there are a few contrived scenes to allow the fleeing Romans inexplicable breathing room to spew manly dialog (hey, I like manly dialog) and even relax with a pretty girl. But overall, Marshall's narrative holds up and none of the characters do anything with swords or spears that seem totally implausible. The acting is solid and way above action film norms. My own personal opinion is that Great Britain produces the best actors in the world. Maybe that is why we Americans are using so many British transplants as leads in our films and TV series. Michael Fassbinder has that cool screen presence an action film star needs, plus he can act. Dominic West was very good as a tough-as-nails Roman general. I also liked David Morrisey and Liam Cunningham as two salt-of-the-earth foot soldiers. While I never really bought Olga Kurylenko as an unstoppable, force-of-nature warrior woman, she handled the fight scenes surprisingly well. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Centurion"" is a first-class film that I'll be adding to my DVD collection. I hope it does well enough at the box office to encourage the making of other historical action films. I have to hand it to the Brits for this one, ""Solomon Kane,"" and the upcoming ""Eagle of the Ninth"" and ""Ironclad."" I don't think there are many US studios that would even consider making a film like ""Centurion"" nowadays. More's the pity."

Its always been a great bit of Scottish pride knowing we were the only country they couldn't invade and for that reason i was all for the Picts. On the other hand the characters were engaging and you couldn't help wishing them to safety.....its kind of like watching the battle of the bulge from the Germans point of view.<br/><br/>Anyway its a good solid movie well worth watching."

","Pointless movie about an Italian guy being chased by a Scottish chick. At least we were warned from the very beginning that there is ""no beginning and no end"" to this story. So, for about one hour and half, they keep on chasing each other, chopping heads, hands but no hens. Somewhere at the end there is the old conflict between the blonde and the brunette in order to throw a meaning to the movie, that is for the spectator to know that the main hero has a reason to live for. Which we don't know for sure since the hero arrives pretty much damaged. Anyway the story can be told regardless the time (Picts and Romans, looks familiar?) or place or even actors. Enjoy!"
"russ-was-here","3","32","83","17 August 2010"," Wheres the chariots Neil Marshall.
","I don't know about you guys but I LOVE a good hack and slash historical movie.<br/><br/>Movies like brave heart while being completely irrelevant to actual history still manage to portray a sense of realism and fact.<br/><br/>This movie on the other hand, while having excellent action scenes seems to have been derived from a ten minute read of the ""Pict"" page on Wikipedia.<br/><br/>The accents are terrible, we've got everything from new York to cockney English (before the birth of modern England of course!) Not to mention the language they speak is portrayed as Gaelic yet the Pictish chief speaks with a ""Scots"" accent, a completely different language and way of speaking, Scots is rough and bold while Gaelic is flowing and poetic.<br/><br/>Then comes the fight scenes and complete absence of interesting Roman tactics, when attacked and flanked on a long narrow path they simply form a 1 man thick shield wall and wait. In reality an internal column would of been marching inside this wall from the rear to double its thickness and concentrate their forces. Romans were known specifically for their mid battle maneuvering to see them all stand there like idiots was quite disappointing.<br/><br/>Not to mention the Roman soldiers in some scenes seem to think parrying an Axe with a short sword is a good idea, as opposed to deflecting or dodging it and counter attacking. This is like standing in front of a sledgehammer with a magic wand... No one in their right mind would do it and when you see that, you instantly lose the excitement.<br/><br/>Then theirs the Picts! who use kindergarten face paint instead of naturally derived dies, I mean COME ON how much would it of cost the director to use genuine natural textured dye like the Pict's used. The stuff they use looks like straight out of a Chinese factory!! I cant begin to explain how absent minded this director/producer must be to completely ignore the fact their ""ancient warriors"" were putting on $2 face paint, while the Roman soldiers were dressed to perfection (maybe not historically accurate but they looked real) this is just pathetic. He could of just added lumps of bloody flower and water and it would of looked real.... this is disgusting apathy.<br/><br/>Then of course there's the complete absence of chariot warfare, which the Pict's were known for. This was generally their only form of cavalry. It is also an extremely interesting thing to add to a fight scene, I don't remember seeing chariots since ""ben hur"".<br/><br/>They also fought naked, or completely devoid of Armour. However they are dressed like vikings for some reason. Yes vikings colonized eastern Great Britain Neil Marshal, they were however not Picts.<br/><br/>This director had a HUGE array of culture and history to draw from to create this movie, instead we have a naive's perspective, and the creation of the type of hack and slash that has been done before so many times. The dodgy one.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to comment on the acting, suffice to say its reasonable and its a real shame it was destroyed by the ""cheapness"" of everything else, you just cant appreciate acting when you haven't been drawn into the movie through its quality."
"phenomynouss","2","12","26","13 November 2010"," Run of the mill action flick
","Everything in this film is unbelievably predictable, stale, by-the-numbers, and obvious. You know right away that the minorities will die first; the Numidian (black guy), the Assyrian (arab guy), the Greek (arab-looking guy), etcetera. There's the standard archetypes, as opposed to characters; the grizzled old soldier, the straight sidekick, the noble superhuman leader who just knows everything on how to survive, including fluent Gaelic, even the token fist-fight with weapon just out of reach and bad guy and good guy racing to get the weapon in time.<br/><br/>I don't particularly mind the use of British accents, not just standard British, but the ""lower"" class type, Cockney, Liverpudilan, Scottish, Irish, etcetera to represent a wide variety of accents that such a mixed Roman Imperial army would have, but it becomes highly disorienting and rips you out of the immersion when they don't just speak with the accents, but use heavily British mannerisms in their speech.<br/><br/>There's virtually little to the characters to make them in any way compelling or likable. In particular, the General is said to be so great, like a father, brother, and even god to his men, yet this is never displayed. It's what TVTropes calls an ""Implied Attribute"", when a character is said to be in a certain way, yet it's never displayed on screen.<br/><br/>The sole token battle scene inspired promise initially, as they show a very well-executed display of Roman discipline, as they quickly got into Schiltron formation, making circles with their shields and spears pointed outward, but once the battle actually unfolded, it devolved to generic Hollywood 'one-man-army' type fighting, with the shields suddenly gone and the swords being used to block axes, and loads of gratuitous gore that at the very least isn't pointless, but is used to such excess that you start to easily spot CG gore, particularly when the blood is just TOO solid in tone---with no variations in color tone based on lighting or shadow.<br/><br/>The rest of the story is just the band of archetypes on the run from Etain, a Brigante who betrays the Romans in such a clear and obvious way, who hunts them viciously until a fight where just three of them survive.<br/><br/>There's even a token romantic subplot which is not only painfully devoid of chemistry, but completely and utterly pointless, without any relevance to the plot, likely just to inflate the run-time by 10 or 15 minutes (the movie is only 1 hour and 30 minutes).<br/><br/>There's not much of interest in this movie. It's typical in being problematic with historical accuracy, has some action, but hardly anything remarkable or not seen in other movies, and done better.<br/><br/>It's the sort of film you'd watch on TV once, maybe while doing something else."
"Caps Fan","7","10","21","28 April 2010"," Actually pretty enjoyable
","Despite a rather corny ending, negligible music and gore that is, at times, gratuitous rather than helpful or horrifying, Neil Marshall has reason to feel well pleased with this effort.<br/><br/>Its main strengths lie in the performances, characters, and script. Michael Fassbender has really come into his own the last couple of years and he turns in another strong performance as Quintus Dias, the eponymous centurion left to pick up the pieces after the IX Legion is decimated in what is now Scotland and its general is captured.<br/><br/>Among those ""pieces"" are the strong, earthy Bothos (great performance from David Morrissey), the Numidian Macros (Noel Clarke) and the villainous Thax (JJ Feild). The interaction between them and others is never less than gripping. Meanwhile, the plot moves along briskly, leaving us little time to draw breath. I don't think I looked at my watch once.<br/><br/>Much as I'd love to quote from the better-than-average script, the examples that struck me are, let's say, rather basic. Hear that script for yourself - it's well worth it.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 (if IMDb allowed halves, it would be 7.5 out of ten)"

","After years of painstaking research and planning, Neil Marshall finally gave Audiences this finish Movie called "" Centurion. "" The original working title was called ' The Ninth Legion. ' But whatever the title then or now, the Finish product is a marvelous achievement. The story for the purposes of this exceptional film, is recalled by the last surviving member of the Legendary Ninth, Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) who relates to the audience what he remembers of the historical confrontation. Returning to the Land of the Picts, the entire legion of Three Thousand men is brutally attacked and decimated until only a token force of some twenty men are left alive, Then with the discipline of the Roman Legionnaire, they are left with no choice but to try and return to their own lines. The movie is as historical accurate as stated in the scrolls and to that end, the audience is given as much drama as possible. Too gory for some, others believe it wasn't brutal enough. Whichever take you give it, it does establish itself as one of the finest action movies since 'Gladiator.' The beautiful costumes and spacious panoramic landscapes are beautifully breathtaking and every battle scene is given a sober dialog. Indeed, the cast members which include, Andreas Wisniewski, Dave Legeno, Ulrich Thomsen and especially Olga Kurylenko, give a auspicious performance. This is one of those movies which in time will be sought after as a great Classic. To that end I for one easily recommend it for the true Collector. ****"
"pepki","10","8","16","18 September 2010"," history repeats itself
","I have selected spoiler alert although I don't think there is much of the story mentioned here. Just in case, people have different levels of what they wish to know about and to hear about. I leave mention of the quality of the story to the end so that the quality of the film is addressed first.<br/><br/>As a student of film and theater, and a teacher of history I really enjoyed this film. The cinematography was lovely, the colors, scenery, dramatic landscape and skin tones amazingly captured. One genuinely felt the bone chilling cold of the mountains, the slice of every blade through sinew and bone. I could have done without the CGI blood splatter. I thought that was a bit silly and distracting. The battles felt real and there was plenty of blood and gore for those who like reality. It takes the romance out of war to see the real effect of slicing into a human body. Even if its a special effect. <br/><br/>The acting was quite good and perhaps so because these are not big names (in the US) but actually actors as well trained in their craft as the Roman centurions in theirs. I appreciated that the filmmakers gave a nod to my intelligence and did not have to create stereotypical caricatures of their characters for the audience to get that both sides have noble and wise people as well as really despicable folk driven by their passions whatever those may be. This was subtly done to the point that some reviewers on this site missed it altogether. I think that's a compliment to the director and writer. One of the hardest things to do in telling a story is to create both feelings of empathy and dislike for the same character. It's very easy to hate a Caligula, but much harder to feel compassion for someone like him. <br/><br/>As for the story, what an interesting tale of the 9th legion and the Picts. A well trained military, the best the world has ever known even by today's standards, following its orders to take over a country, clashes with a nation of people that on first impression seems barbaric and cruel but on closer inspection has its own rich culture, faith, and sense of honor and duty. <br/><br/>One might see the parallels with today's US & European military in the Middle East. This is to me, as a historian, the most interesting part of the tale since humans seem to continue to repeat their bloody history without learning from it. Centurion is reminiscent of the film Black Hawk Down, only set a thousand years ago. Everything in this film has really happened and will continue to happen as long as people use bloodshed to gain power and for vengeance. <br/><br/>To me the story's moral is that it is possible to be both on the good side and the bad side at the same time, depending on the individual's sense of honor and character, and the situation at hand.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>In my opinion the mini love story is a much wanted reward for the most noble knight of all and yet outcast. In real life many soldiers throughout history found solace in the arms of their female occupied enemies. Usually outcast women were the ones to take these invaders into their arms because no man of their own country would have them for various reasons. All too frequently non-outcast women were severely punished for taking the enemy into their beds. In France they shaved women's heads for sleeping with Germans, in Greece they might kill the girl after they killed the German. But the outcast women were for the most part left alone. For that reason, I think this film has a great ending."

","Quite good actually. One should know what to expect from a film, I expected decent historical portrayal of how cruel and dangerous life could be in Britain near the year 100, what being a Roman soldier there was like, a bit about Picts being fearsome fighters, and some gory, untamed fighting scenes. I got all that, plus a convincing Kurylenko in a mute role... One should not expect a brilliant script in a film like this, sure there were minor complaints to be made: Kurylenko's character was supposedly an experienced warrior but she apparently had no clue how to attack a fort or a village defended by only 3 men..., Picts' leader's son is killed by Romans yet he sends only a handful of Picts after them with a woman in charge??.. Well, it seems to be headed for a sequel, with the hero living in a hut with the hot witch, she getting killed by the Picts and our hero on a revenge quest and all... or something like that. If they keep it that gruesome, bloody and realistic I do not mind if they make another 5 movies about this Roman centurion in Britain."

Roman men stranded in Scotland behind Hadrians wall, being chased by the enemy picking them off one by one, even the Blue battle make up for the Scottish Woads/Picts as they were called in each movie was the same. It also appeared that the director had stolen ideas from various other films, Last of the mohicans for the attack on the Road and Spartacus for the fireballs being rolled at the Roman soldiers. Olga Kurylenko, what a waste.......giving her a role as a mute !!!! We did not really see much acting ability from her here.<br/><br/>It was after this list of complaints still a watchable movie with some good action scenes and a pretty predictable ending.

The director seems focused on showing scenes of swords and slashing rather than a story. 300 gave us gore with swords. Do something different! And the end?? Did Mills and Boon give a helping hand? The depiction of the Picts is laughable by the way if you know your history. The Romans;' in one scene you get the stereotypical politician and in another you get to the Syrian cook. Does this director know any history? I have to be honest and say I was looking forward to this. Perhaps, I expected too much. Regardless, avoid.

","Well I loaded this title into my DVD player with the anticipation of watching a star studded gritty film along the lines of Braveheart or Apocolypto, how disappointed I was. The film has very little story line, has some bloody moments but most battle scenes are a flurry and it's hard to tell who is battling who. Some scenes are ridiculous, for example someone having their throat slit with a 'Shhhting' noise (metal on metal) then immediately dropping dead, there are numerous others but I won't spoil. Other ridiculous elements are the mute waif of a woman portrayed as super warrior and killing everyone she come across, and all the actors were speaking with a modern south England accent.No effort made to portray a Scottish accent or speak in an appropriate manner for the period, but then the script probably didn't demand this. All in all a film resigned to the 'forget and never watch again' category."

Actually a lot of it seems quite implausible. The movie has some interesting moments in it but most of the time it's long-winded. A positive thing about ""Centurion"" is that there isn't the typical 'good and bad' thing. But the reason for that is, that no character is really symphatetic which on the other hand is not very positive. Better ways to entertain yourself with Roman history are out there but for some pastime it's okay. Don't expect too much."

(B) short of the ninths' disappearance there's not much here in the way of history and from what I've read on the matter, its not even the prevalent theory among historians i.e its not a history lesson. (C) a group of about eight Picts on horseback is not so overwhelming a force so that the seven Romans on foot wouldn't stand a chance, especially when the Romans had a lead- and from that, the element of surprise. I don't think the Romans even discussed confrontation, I don't know, I'm not sure and I ain't watching it again to confirm. :-("

","Centurion is about the Ninth Legion which may or may not have disappeared during the Roman occupation of Brittania. There has been some interest in the Ninth recently with the Arthurian kids film The Last Legion and the forthcoming Eagle of the Ninth project.<br/><br/>The film is vintage Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent, Doomsday etc.) in that it combines extreme gore with good dialogue and a high body count. The acting is universally excellent the special effects are good and the story exciting (if not at all complex). <br/><br/>Spoiler<br/><br/>It's 117 AD, and bang on time.

To assist he lends them his best underwear model... sorry, I mean his best tracker, a mute Pict called Etain (Olga Kurilenko). Along the way they happen across Quintus, who has escaped his pursuers and co-opt him into guiding them to the Pictish stronghold.<br/><br/>Soon after the Legion is ambushed and destroyed by Gorlacon's troops. Quintus and a small band of Romans survive and set off to save the captured general. <br/><br/>The rest of the film involves Quintus' small band of soldiers attempt to make it back to friendly territory whilst being relentlessly pursued by an angry Russian underwear model with a fur fetish. <br/><br/>End Spoiler<br/><br/>Neil Marshall is at his very best in stories about soldiers and in Centurion he is back on territory familiar from Dog Soldiers (2002). Barring the supernatural element there is some similarity in the tone of both films and I feel certain that if you enjoyed one you will enjoy the other. Both films involve a small unit of professional soldiers in a situation that they cannot control and seem unlikely to survive. <br/><br/>I can offer Centurion no greater praise than to say that it is almost as good as Dog Soldiers."

","All guts, no glory: that seems to be the message of Neil Marshall's ""Centurion"". Although the splattery battle scenes are its main selling point, it is also one of the most uncompromisingly anti-war films I have ever seen. It doesn't just say that war is futile; it says that was is death. You are asked to leave your humanity behind and become a killing machine, and then you most likely end up dead anyway, one more anonymous ""number"" for the history books. There are no ""good"" or ""bad"" sides, either; the story is mostly told from the perspective of the Romans, of course, but both they and the Picts are trapped in an endless cycle of violence (the parallels with contemporary wars are so obvious that they don't even need to be stated). The battle scenes are not entirely free of the trendy quick-cutting/blurry-editing syndrome, however Marshall is to be commended for avoiding CGI and using old-school, practical effects instead. The big battle where the Ninth Legion gets nearly annihilated is a bit too chaotic (yes, I realize that a real battle during that era would be pretty much exactly like that), but the ""last stand"" fight at the abandoned fort near the end is genuinely exciting - it has a definite ""Do or Die"" feel to it. Add points for some eye-filling panoramic shots of hills, valleys, forests and rivers; subtract points for the sometimes too-contemporary dialogue (""Your mother must have had a great sense of humor"" - ""She was a f*****g comedian!""). Although the frenetic pacing (especially in the first half) doesn't allow for much character development (beyond a few ""bonding"" scenes), Michael Fassbender gives a very strong performance as the lead. Olga Kurylenko is fixating (with ""Centurion"", ""Quantum of Solace"" and her still-unreleased female assassin film ""Kirot"", she is becoming quite the dedicated action actress; her skill with the spear in particular in this movie is very impressive); Ulrich Thomsen is powerful as the leader of the Picts; Imogen Poots is extremely lovely as perhaps the only ray of hope in this world; Dominic West, despite his second billing, has very little to do. **1/2 out of 4."

I loved the scary tense atmosphere & the bleak winter setting & the lonely cold mountains it all adds realism & grit to the chase survival story that itself is based on legend & history but with a more modern The Warriors (1979) chase twist on it & it works perfectly.
Doomsday (2008) is another EXCELLENT Neil Marshall film that's got that Warriors vibe all through it along with the tone of escape from new york,another AWESOME movie.
A great cast including Fassbender & the excellent Dominic west & a few other names but these two stood out as excellent performances!!!
The tribal hunters ""The Picks"" are savage & scary & are constantly hunting our small group of men & it's suspenseful & exciting.
Another excellent & way underrated Neil Marshall movie but hey i loved it.<br/><br/>Also i have to say im very happy that this is not another over long BORING historical epic like Braveheart or Gladiator or countless other bore fests!!!

","I just watched the movie, and it exceeded my expectations, it seems that every movie with Fassbender these days is worth watching. The story has a good pace, good story, and the actors are very convincing in their roles. I always enjoy historical movies, as long as they stay true, or very close to, history. I have seen many movies that sacrifice history for the sake of a story, but this movie stays very close to the historical account of the times. Although it is a work of fiction, the action sequences do not cross the line to science fiction, or cartoons, and though graphic, at times, is not there to make up for a lack of a script, and if removed, the story would be unaffected. My only complaint is that I think they tipped the ending off a little bit when he leaves the witch's house, the brief pause foreshadows the ending, but doesn't make it painfully obvious, so easily forgivable."
"robocopssadside-1","Null","4","8","30 January 2011"," Centurion (2010)
","A Roman Centurion joins forces with the Ninth Legion to eradicate a savage group of Celts known as the Picts.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of ""Sword and Sandal"" stories, even the really bad Italian knock-off ones (I.e. Lucio Fulci's ""Conquest""). I have fond memories of watching Conan and Beastmaster, and even rushing home from school to be on time for He-Man (which I think more than qualifies to be part of said genre). Therefore, I was colored excited after learning the news that director Neil Marshall would be doing a medieval thriller set in 117 A.D. He had already become a favorite of mine after two great horror films (Dog Soldiers and the Descent) and an underrated apocalyptic Sci-Fi flick (Doomsday), so ""Centurion"" sounded impressive by default. While it is not as epic as I imagined, it still manages to be an extremely fast-paced ninety-minute ride of gory, violent fun.<br/><br/>The entire film is essentially a chase scene. Centurion Dias (Michael Fassbender) escapes Pict imprisonment early on, only to be immediately pursued by them through the icy Scottish mountains and deep forests. It is here where the Ninth Legion (who are on orders from the Governor of Rome to wipe out the Picts) rescues him. A mute woman named Etain (Olga Kurylenko) is hired by the Governor to travel with General Vuirilius and his men as a tracker. Secretly with the Picts, Etain betrays the Legion, leading them into an ambush where all but a handful are unknowingly left alive. From here on, it is a battle for the men to stay alive long enough to make it home to their families.<br/><br/>If not for quick-flash style battle sequences, this film would be strongly hindered by computer-generated blood FX. I am not against CGI, but they are a nuisance when used on a movie with an obviously restrained budget. Luckily, it is a 50/50 mix of computer imagery and traditional makeup gore; and even though the bulk of the action is shown with rapid shots that are gone before you can fully process them, there is plenty of brutality to blow your mind. If I were told to add up the number of dismemberments and impalements in this picture, I would run out of fingers and toes to count with.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender does an excellent job in his role as the Centurion, and his narration throughout the film is fantastic. He has been popping up all over the place ever since his minor parts in ""300"" and ""Inglourious Basterds"", and it is great to see him successfully hold his own in a lead position. For a role with zero dialogue involved, Olga Kurylenko does an amazing job of building her character into something believable. She is cold-blooded, completely filled with hatred, and will stop at nothing to kill every Roman in her sight; though, occurrences in her past make her an almost sympathetic character. Imogen Poots (28 Weeks Later), Dominic West (300), and Liam Cunningham (Dog Soldiers) all also give above par performances in their supporting roles, as well.<br/><br/>So that about sums it up. ""Centurion"" is not anything new or groundbreaking, but like all of Neil Marshall's past films, it is a lot of fun; and the story is surprisingly solid for a movie that sounds like a no-brainer at face value. It is a definite recommendation for fans of ""Pathfinder"", ""Gladiator"", ""Red Sonja"" and other aforementioned films within the ""Sword and Sandal"" genre."
"CelluloidDog","6","4","8","5 January 2011"," Follows Gladiator in its fierce spirit with flaws
","The latest entry into the modern peplum (blood and sandals) film this film uses a bit of the Gladiator formula. The good news is that it doesn't overkill on CGI like 300. I'm still shocked how high 300 ratings are...really it's quite average but it appears to develop a cult following. Like some people consider McDonald's great food. Anyhow, like Gladiator, it deals with Roman legionnaires who fight for Rome although perhaps they'd rather retire and have a normal life with a family. Michael Fassbender and archrival Olga Kurylenko leads a strong, relatively unknown cast of legionnaires versus Picts. <br/><br/>The plot deals with the massacre of the Ninth Legion and how it tries to rescue its general but instead is hounded by Picts bent on revenge. The film is Gladiator meets Deliverance as the legionnaires and their Picts enemies hunt each other to death. The acting and cinematography is very good. <br/><br/>The films weakness is sometimes the action where the blood looks too bright like tomato juice. Aside from that, the action was fairly good and I think actually better than the over- CIGed 300. Neil Marshall was probably also rushed to finish this film on a limited budget. And the opening scenes which start off like an opera singer choking on a high note. It's a bit jarred at the start but as it gathers moss, it flies smoothly to the point. The final showdown isn't a big fight since the sides have been decimated but it leads to the end where futility in fighting for Rome is realized. Which is why I compare it to Gladiator. Its message is the simple life is more desirable than glory. Russell Crowe as Maximus loves his family and wanted to go home. Quintus Dias finds whats more important to him than glory.<br/><br/>It looked like the distributors/producers couldn't market this film and panicked thinking it won't sell tickets at the theater. So it was sadly pulled to go to DVD. Not a bad film."
"Gunn","9","4","8","15 November 2010"," A Surprising Gem of a film!
","I stumbled on the DVD of ""Centurion"" knowing nothing about it and was rewarded with a fascinating, involving and enjoyable film. I figured it was probably a Roman epic film, which is a genre I truly enjoy, but it was even more. It involves the Roman invasion of Britain and their eventual confrontations with the Picts in Northern Scotland which led to the building of Hadrian's Wall (which still stands to this day). The Wall was built as the end of the Roman line in Britain AND to keep out the Picts. The film is well cast, expertly directed, cinematically stunning with its cold landscapes and it really moves along at a furious pace while never ""boring"" the viewer. Michael Fassbender plays Quintus Dias, the titular Centurion whose Roman stronghold has been attacked by the Picts. Because he speaks the Pict language he is taken hostage and while in captivity learns much about the Picts. He escapes and encounters Rome's famed 9th Legion. They are about to quell the ""Pict situation"" led by a Pict scout, Etain (Olga Kurylenko) who is leading them straight into a deadly ambush. From there the story builds into an escape for survival. Dominic West is excellent as the legendary General Titus Flavius Virilus, leader of the Roman 9th Legion as are Ulric Thomsen as Gorlacon, King of the Picts; David Morrissey as Bothos a fellow escapee; Imogen Poots is lovely as Arianne the witch and the rest of the cast also shines. This is a Braveheart type epic with bloody battles and a fascinating story based on truth. There was a Roman 9th Legion who headed into Scotland and was never seen nor heard of again. Although this story is speculation by writer/director Neil Marshall, it is based on various facts and actual historical figures. I do not understand the first review here where the reviewer could not empathize with the Romans, as they were invaders, nor the savage Picts. To me this is like blaming soldiers for policy for which they are not involved. This is more a story of humans rather than soldiers or warriors and survival rather than war or conflict. I highly recommend this film, but a warning for those who cannot take scenes of blood and gore; this film has some of those!"

","The movie is clearly a low budget one, from the moment the film starts with a map of Roman Empire Brittania appearing from the mist while a deep voice explains what goes on to the mostly unknown and smallish cast. But they did a great job with what they had!<br/><br/>The plot did not go in the direction I would have wanted - I believe an opportunity for a great strategic guerrilla warfare film was missed here - but it worked well, nonetheless. Pict tribes decimate a Roman legion and the few survivors run for their lives. A bit too much running, and to not much avail. And did the story really need the good caring blonde?<br/><br/>The acting is very good, the landscapes fantastic, the atmosphere well done and the battles really bloody. It works perfectly as an action film, well as a historic dramatic depiction and kind of fails as a romance. Full thumbs up for movies that are well done by people who care about the film they make!"

"Enchorde","6","2","3","11 December 2010"," God historical war action, but with a disturbing flaw
","Recap: Centurion Dias is one of the Roman officers at a camp recently overrun by Pict raiders. Taken prisoner, he is brought before Gorlacon, the king of the Picts. However, he manages to escape and return to Roman lines just in time to join the ninth legion on their march to conquer the Picts. However, the legion is wiped out by a Pict attack, and Dias and a few friends find themselves lost far behind enemy lines and hunted by the best there is.<br/><br/>Comments: A rather good movie, far more closer to the genre action than drama. It is tricky to do good historical war movies, but Centurion manages fairly well. My only real concern is that the quality and the unfortunate overuse of blood and gore is not up to the standard that the rest of the movie has. Really a minor part of the movie, but it really stands out and bugs me. It seems that they ran out of budget and had to cut corners somewhere, unfortunately they chose something that they want to show in almost every action scene. For me it really brought the movie down a notch.<br/><br/>Otherwise it is pretty good, even though the story wasn't the best, but good enough, but it got a little repetitive in the end. The soldiers ran, and the Picts hunted, that's about it. But for the 90 minutes it ran, it did work out OK.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I knew this film was set during a time period full of men in armour with swords, I think that's about it really, I was up for giving it a go, directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent). Basically in Roman Britain in the year AD 117, five years before the construction of Hadrian's Wall, Roman centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) is the son of a legendary gladiator, and the sole survivor of a Pictish raid on a Roman frontier fort. Gnaeus Julius Agricola (Raiders of the Lost Ark's Paul Freeman), the Roman governor of Britannia, dispatches the Ninth Legion, legendary army of General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West), to eradicate the Pictish threat and destroy their leader Gorlacon (Festen's Ulrich Thomsen), the legion marches north, they encounter and rescue Dias. The legion are ambushed on unfamiliar ground, Virilus is taken captive, Quintus and his small platoon face a desperate struggle to stay alive behind enemy lines, rescue the general and reach the safety of the Roman frontier. They are forced to endure harsh terrain and evade their remorseless Pict pursuers led by revenge- hungry Pict warrior Etain (Quantum of Solace's Olga Kurylenko), one by one the soldiers fall victim to the savagery of their enemy. In the end, to avoid criticism and other consequences, all records of the Ninth Legion are destroyed, so to this day nobody knows the full truth of what happened to them when they disappeared. Also starring Noel Clarke as Macros, Game of Thrones' Liam Cunningham as Brick, David Morrissey as Bothos, Four Lions' Rizwan Ahmed as Tarak, Imogen Poots as Arianne, JJ Feild as Thax, Dave Legeno as Vortix, Lee Ross as Septus, Ryan Atkinson as Gorlacon's Son and The Living Daylights' Andreas Wisniewski as Commander Gratus. I agree with critics that not a lot of effort went into making a really engrossing story and the characters are not that developed, so there is a slight lack of suspense and emotional involvement, but to be honest, I was paying much more attention to the fight and chase sequences, full of many violent and blood soaked deaths, overall it's an alright historical action thriller. Okay!"

But alas, no. It really boiled down to a mix of all too familiar ingredients. The Hollywood-newfound grittiness of Romans in the cold climate(gladiator), the chase, the jumping from a high cliff to escape, the black sheep in our midst. And in the end it get worse: the girl that the hero is getting (you see this coming from miles away what makes it more unbearable) and then the awkward and absurd getting attacked by your own rulers, victim of the system ploy. The last implemented as a means to surprise the audience and have them leave with the feeling they have been watching an unpredictable and meaningful movie. Duh!"
"henk-tortura","7","5","12","3 September 2010"," Great action movie with strong political message
","This is how Conan movie should like. The action was relentless from beginning to end, and bloody as hell.. Kudos for the brutality level and for the realistic violence. You get a real feeling for what it might actually have been like to fight hand-to-hand in ancient times. It has excellent make-up design and costumes. It also has a beautiful cinematography that depicts cruelty and beauty of the Scottish landscapes where the ancient struggle of life and death took place. <br/><br/>The scene at the beginning of the movie is unforgettable -The ambush on the Ninth Legion by the Picts. Marshall masterfully created a horrible claustrophobic atmosphere when besieged Romans are waiting the attack from the Picts in dark forest.<br/><br/>But the best thing in Centurion is Olga Kurylenko as convincing warrior woman, something that is so rare in films of this kind. Olga did a great job with the character, she was ruthless, savage and creepy. She really steals the show, she is beauty and the beast all wrapped in one.<br/><br/>Yes, of course, Neil should have work more on story and character development, to remove all illogical and naive solutions from the plot ,to avoid cliché twists typical of the chase movies, to put a story in a broader historical context, but all of this would require quality screenwriter, better/famous/expensive actors, much bigger budget and a strong Hollywood studio behind that. And in that case the film would not be directed by Marshall and again we would see another Hollywood sword-and-sandals movie, polished and designed to please everyone like Gladiator. Nobody wanted to see again same boring theatrical Hollywood duels with fencing that lasts ten minutes, with macho posing as in 300, with pretty gay bodybuilders with oiled muscles who shout stupid slogans during the fight. <br/><br/>When Marshall announced that he is going to direct Centurion, all people familiar with his work knew what to expect from this movie: brutal and bloody action in the dark horror atmosphere. His horror fans have been interested to see how he would manage in the new genre, confident that he will not depart from his style, and all fans of historical films about ancient wars were amazed that someone would eventually capture and reflect the battles of the period as they truly were-brutal, without mercy, and of course with a lot of blood, spilled brains, cut-off limbs and heads. And that's what make this movie worthy of being in your DVD collection.<br/><br/>The movie also contains strong political message against the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and against any war, of course. Every spectator is cheering for the Picts. You really don't care for Roman soldiers except for Quintus Dias but he is not the typical Roman soldier. At the very beginning we learn that he is the son of gladiator, he shows no hatred towards the Picts , even in the scenes when he kills them, he is just struggling to survive. At the end he stands up against his superiors (just like the Marine in the Avatar ) and by his love relationship with Arianne (Imogene),he indirectly joins the people who he came to enslave. Etain(Olga)on the other hand, at the beginning was presented to us almost as a beast in human form-heartless and bloodthirsty savage woman who is torturing and brutally killing the helpless prisoners, allowing us to suggest that she is the main villain.But then, we learn about dark secret from her past and about horrible crimes of the Romans who destroyed her life, then not only do we find justification for her brutality and obduracy, but we even feel sorry for her when she finally get killed at the end. Arriane is also cool character, but totally opposite from Olga. She is the victim of war too but unlike Olga, she is trying to hide from the war and evil, she does not hate, neither she wants the revenge for the injustice they have done to her, she has compassion and humanity even for the enemy. She is like some kind of a nun in the monastery. We could find both kind of women in modern days. Olga is for example a female commando from Israeli Army eager for adventure and action, or a Muslim suicide bomber who has nothing more to lose, and Arianne is a family woman who sits home and takes care of her children and of course, hates violence. In fact, two of them together are the perfect combination that makes an ideal woman-dream of every man. <br/><br/>If you can, watch Centurion on the big screen.<br/><br/>7/10"

Cool, gory battle scenes - at times the editing makes it feel like they are trying to fit as many on screen deaths as possible within the smallest amount of screen time. I just never really got that engaged with the characters. Overall, this is a timekiller which is competent, uncompromising and mostly visually interesting, but overall, nothing remarkable or really innovative. I thought The Descent was much more effective.

","The real fate of the 9-th is not known, however, although it was indeed present in Britain just before Hadrian wall was built there, it is now believed by most scholars that it was later transferred to the east of the empire, which was a much more important part to the romans than Britain. The fact is that names of several high officers of the Ninth who cannot have served earlier than the alleged destruction of the ninth in Britain, are noted in later references, is clear indication that the legion was not destroyed but transferred. It may have been destroyed some 15 years later, during the Jewish revolt of Simon ben Kosiba (132-136) in which several others Roman legions were wipe-out too, the revolt in which almost half of an entire roman army was involved and eventually, was crushed by General Julius Severus fromBritain, has also put to the end the name Judea, replacing it by Syria Palaestina, which two thousand years later, claimed by the new arrivals: the Palestinians, as their ancient homeland."
"s-gordon2","5","4","9","13 September 2010"," Mediocre
","Essentially, this is a chase movie. It begins with a brief overview of a Roman Empire with an increasingly tenuous grip on Britain, its governor Agricola under pressure to end the threat of the Picts and their effective guerrilla warfare tactics. Enter the 9th Legion. Supplied with a native scout, (Kurylenko) who has had her tongue cut out, they are given the task of eliminating the Pict threat. Under the command of Dominic West the legion is led into a trap by Kurylenko where they are butchered almost to a man. After a botched attempt to rescue their captured general the surviving Roman soldiers, led by centurion Michael Fassbender, must flee to their own lines while being pursued by expert tracker Kurylenko and her band of Picts.<br/><br/>So, why the average score? To begin with we are asked to believe that Kurylenko, despite the handicap of being mute has managed to gain the trust of the Romans. We're not told how she has accomplished this but OK, keep going. When she predictably leads the entire legion straight into an ambush however, you can't help but think the director has failed to convince that the legion general (Dominic West) would so easily walk into it. A further failure of this scene is that it lacks any sense of scale. A Roman legion consisted of more than 5000 men, yet no more than a few hundred appear on screen, with even less of the attacking Picts visible. The latter may well have been due to budget constraints but leaves the viewer with the impression of a skirmish rather than a great battle.<br/><br/>Shortly after we are treated to a scene of the captured general who, after the failed rescue attempt by his men is surely facing a grim death. Step up Kurylenko brandishing a spear. But wait, what's this? He's been cut free and handed a sword! Surely he is not going to go one on one with the six stone soaking wet powerhouse Kurylenko? Oh dear. Yes, this was too much disbelief for me to suspend I'm afraid. A Roman legion commanding general bested by a little girl who looks like she fell in the 'dressing up' box. Sorry, but no matter how much war paint you put on her, this was laughable. What follows is more of the same as the ranks of the surviving Romans are thinned by Kurylenko and her band, culminating in a fight with centurion Michael Fassbender, which despite him emerging as the victor is ridiculously evenly matched for the most part. We're even told that Fassbender has been trained by a gladiator, yet Kurylenko with her little pipe cleaner arms is seemingly a tough opponent. Pathetic. Spare me this warrior woman 'only in the movies' rubbish Neil Marshall. It shouldn't have any place in a film of this kind. There are other flaws with the movie but these have been suitably highlighted by other reviewers.<br/><br/>OK, what's good? Well, there's plenty of action. Limbs and heads are routinely separated from their bodies in what is generally a fast paced movie. It's also fairly short at 93 minutes so if you have the same problems I do with this film you won't have to wait too long for it to finish. As someone else on here said, I love a good hack and slash historical yarn so I'd had high hopes for this film. Sadly, despite some decent action it falls victim to the modern day disease of cliché and political correctness. A rental at best."

","I'm not really sure what Neil Marshall's point was with this movie. He's blushingly swooning over The Warriors, Braveheart, and Gladiator while, understandably, appalled by Zack Snyder's ugly aesthetic of 300. But the whole affair is a confused mess of ideas that I just couldn't care about it, which is strange, as I recall liking this when I saw it in the cinema back in 2010.<br/><br/>So Michael Fassbender is a Roman soldier left behind enemy lines in Caledonia, who escapes, then goes back behind enemy lines, and escapes again, then goes back. While this circular annoyance is happening the Romans go about massacring the Picts, who don't take too kindly to their land being invaded.<br/><br/>The Romans are the bad guys here. They are the invading force. How on Earth are we supposed to be on their side? I wanted to see them killed. Protaganists they ain't, but we're supposed to root for them and enjoy seeing the Picts get wiped out. Also, the CGI blood is among the absolute worst I have ever seen in any movie. It's so unconvicing it looks like it was cartooned onto the film by someone unskilled in the 1985 version of Microsoft Paint. I can't believe anyone involved in the movie okayed this attempt, it looks terrible and it took me out of the scene every time I saw it. Even the opening credits, laughably executed in 3D, are in very bad low-resolution text. Standard lettering would have been more professional.<br/><br/>Other than the sight of a few hot Pictish chicks and some pretty mountain scenery there's no reason to watch this and if you manage to get through it you'll forget about it in a day.

Neil Marshall directs a cast of wonderfully skilled actors to create the Roman military force, its territorial governor, and the Pict tribe whose territory was overrun by the Romans after Caesar's invasion.<br/><br/>The threads of bureaucratic necessity and military tension in this ""***hole of the world"" are set powerfully against the Picts' hatred of the conquerors who took their lands, killed their families, and drove them north into the wilds of what is now Scotland.<br/><br/>At the centre of this story is Quintas Dias, the Roman officer who comes to be in the Ninth Legion when it meets its fate on a forest track Michael Fassbender gives a perfectly-sustained performance as the soldier who realises that his task is to locate and rescue the Legion's commanding officer (Dominic West) and then to lead the small band of survivors back to Roman-held territory. The Roman's grudging admiration for the skill and tenacity of his opponents is made more complex by his discovery that the Empire he's sworn to defend is quite capable of betraying its soldiers' loyalty in the name of political expedience. Quintus Dias's final choice will be understood by any viewer who's had to ask where his or her loyalty, and sense of home, truly lies.<br/><br/>The magnificently-filmed landscape of Scotland is a perfect, evocative setting for the military encampments of Picts and Romans, and the journeys of escape and pursuit which criss-cross its northern territory. And the cast's discipline in dealing with the snow, wind, and icy waters, make their quests vivid and tense. Several performances stand out - Fassbinder and West as totally-focused military commanders, David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham as centurions for whom the soldier's life is the only reality, Paul Freeman as a self-serving territorial Governor who longs for Rome, and JJ Feild as a soldier whose calculated self- centredness jeopardizes his own comrades. Ulrich Thomsen, the celtic king Gorlacon, and Olga Kurylenko, the tracker Etain, shine as Picts whose hatred of Rome is relentless, and wholly understandable. I give a salute also to Imogen Poots, who plays the celtic necromancer Arianne with warmth, yearning, and strength - a necessary counterpoint to Kurylenko's demonic intensity. Anyone who values the power and craft of Gladiator will be glad to see Centurion - another journey into the world of Empire which makes clear, in very contemporary ways, the ambiguity of the conqueror's role, and the reasons explaining the hatred felt by those who've been conquered. Well done, Neil Marshall."
"a666333","5","3","6","8 October 2012"," Seriously flawed, partly rescued by good on-location shooting
","I managed to enjoy the movie because of the on-location shooting. We don't get much of that anymore. The many small mistakes, use of clichés (both in dialogue and action) and the continuous abuse of history were hard to take. Likewise the adrenalin surge style directing and lack of good dialogue and proper character development amount to lost opportunities. It could have been soooooo much better. Really, I would like to kick the director and the producer in their heads. They had the potential to make something really special and missed the target by a wide margin. <br/><br/>The ending seemed to set up for and hint at some kind of a sequel. Maybe they will do better with that. It wouldn't be too difficult. Make it longer, slower, more dialogue to explore the characters and respect the viewer by being more faithful to history."
"JamesHitchcock","5","3","6","5 January 2012"," Men on the Run
","It is strange how two otherwise unrelated films on the same topic can sometimes suddenly appear within a short time of one another. In 1960, for example, there were two filmed biographies of Oscar Wilde, a writer whose life had never previously been the subject of a film, and in the early seventies two separate studios were, quite by chance, working on disaster movies about skyscrapers on fire. When they discovered the coincidence they decided to join forces and produce the film now known as ""The Towering Inferno"". More recently, 2009 saw two French biopics of the fashion designer Coco Chanel, ""Coco Chanel et Igor Stravinsky"" and ""Coco avant Chanel"".<br/><br/>""Centurion"" is another example of the same phenomenon. It was one of two films from 2010/2011 about the massacre of the Ninth Legion in the early part of the second century AD, the other being ""The Eagle"". Historians of the Roman period are divided about the exact fate of this legion, but both films explore the theory that it was destroyed in battle with the Picts, the inhabitants of what was then known as Caledonia and today as the Scottish Highlands.<br/><br/>The film is ostensibly set in AD 117, but there are several historical inaccuracies. The Roman governor of Britannia is named as ""Agricola""; there were two British governors of this name but the first, the famous Gnaeus Julius Agricola, had died in AD 93, and the second, Sextus Calpurnius Agricola, would not become governor until nearly fifty years after the events depicted here. The film also refers to Hadrian's Wall although construction of the wall did not begin until AD 122.<br/><br/>Agricola fears that the warlike Picts are becoming a threat to the peace and stability of Britannia, so he sends the Ninth Legion under their commander Titus Flavius Virilus to subdue them. (The commander's cognomen is spelt as ""Virilus"" in the cast list, although the correct spelling should probably be ""Virilis"", meaning ""manly""). The Romans, however, are ambushed by the Picts; Virilus is captured and most of his soldiers killed. The film follows the adventures of a small group of survivors, including the title character Centurion Quintus Dias, as they attempt to make their way to safety through hostile territory.<br/><br/>Neither ""Centurion"" nor ""The Eagle"" bears much resemblance to traditional Roman films like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus"", or even modern ones like ""Gladiator"". They were made on a much lower budget, and on a much smaller scale than those grand epics. They do not deal with Kings and Emperors or with great, world-shattering events but rather with the lives of relatively humble individuals caught up in desperate power-struggles. Yet despite these resemblances there are also many differences between the two films.<br/><br/>An important element in ""The Eagle"" is the close friendship which develops between the retired Roman officer Aquila and his British slave Esca, and the two, very different, men are well characterised by Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell. The characterisation in ""Centurion"" is much more perfunctory; neither Quintus not any of his companions emerge as rounded characters. The one memorable character is the mute British woman Etain who acts as the Legion's guide but who betrays them to the Picts. (Was, I wonder, Etain originally intended to be mute, or was this detail added at a later stage to disguise Olga Kurylenko's foreign accent?) Etain, however, is at the centre of the film's biggest plot hole. We learn that she is mute because the Romans, who have also murdered the rest of her family, have cut out her tongue, but it is never explained why Agricola and Virilus are so stupid as to entrust the safety of the Legion to a woman with such excellent reasons to hate the Roman empire and all it stands for.<br/><br/>I must admit that I found ""The Eagle"", which is more than just an action-adventure, by far the better of the two films. It asks some pertinent questions about such concepts as imperialism, honour, freedom and friendship and about respect for alien cultures. ""Centurion"", by contrast, is a simple action thriller which avoids asking questions about deeper issues. The Roman occupation of Britain is simply used as the exotic backdrop to a basic men-on-the-run thriller plot which could equally well have been made about soldiers from any other war in history or, with a modern setting, about escaping prisoners or about a group of friends who have fallen foul of a gang of criminals. In ""Apocalypto"", Mel Gibson was able to endow a similar ""chase"" thriller in an exotic setting with a certain freshness and originality; Neil Marshall, unfortunately, is unable to perform the same service for ""Centurion"". 5/10"

"Hellmant","6","3","6","18 November 2010"," A ""Splat Pack"" take on Roman history!
","'CENTURION': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Neil Marshall (writer and director of 'DOOMSDAY', 'THE DESCENT' and 'DOG SOLDIERS') writes and directs this historical adventure film about Roman soldiers under attack behind enemy lines in Northern Britain. Marshall is a horror and gore master and a member of the ""Splat Pack"", an unofficial grouping of named modern horror filmmakers. This film is more of an adventure / war film but it still has a surprising amount of gratuitous violence. The film, like Marshall's others, was filmed in the UK and features actors like Michael Fassbender, Dominic West, David Morrissey and Olga Kurylenko (the most recent 'Bond' girl).<br/><br/>The film revolves around Roman soldier Quintus Dias (Fassbender) who is the lone survivor of a Pictish attack on a Roman frontier fort. He's taken captive by the Picts and later escapes. He then is enlisted in the Ninth Legion and returns for vengeance on the Picts alongside General Virilus (West). The legion is ambushed, Virilus is taken prisoner and the remaining, living group, of Roman soldiers is left to fend for their own behind enemy lines. The Picts are led by the vengeful Etain (Kurylenko) who led the legion into the ambush and double crossed them.<br/><br/>The film is mildly entertaining but for me it just doesn't live up to Marshall's other films. I really liked 'DOOMSDAY' and I enjoyed 'THE DESCENT' and 'DOG SOLDIERS'. The action scenes were cool but a little too violent, in a way that didn't seem necessary (although I'm one of the last people to complain about film violence). The main thing I felt was lacking in the film is that the characters aren't very interesting or likable (maybe partially due to lackluster performances). I also felt kind of strange being forced into rooting for the Roman soldiers when they really were the bad guys of the film; the narrative was all wrong. Overall the movie is a slightly above average adventure film.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPqFKAK3fro"

The problem is that the mute tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko) isn't working for the Romans after all.<br/><br/>That's it really - one long chase across some of the bleakest landscapes ever put on film, with intermittent slaughter. The script is functional and occasionally witty. The performances are mostly OK, insofar as you can tell underneath the layers of furs and grime.<br/><br/>The action sequences tend to suffer from both hand-held camera syndrome and quick cutting syndrome - it isn't always easy to follow what's going on.<br/><br/>I do wish Imogen Poots would change her surname, she sounds like a character out of Monty Python.<br/><br/>But, of its sort, it is entertaining enough."

All of which I found surprising for this genre and so may have earned it a slightly higher rating.<br/><br/>That said, at times the fight scenes failed to convince and I felt they could have been a more raw and visceral. There was a mêlée scene which reminded me of the opening of Gladiator, without copying it out right.<br/><br/>I also had a few plot points where I thought: ""why would they ..."", or ""why didn't they ..."", but for the most part the plot made sense and I found the characters motivations and actions believable.<br/><br/>The beautiful scenery should also be mentioned and the movie did a great job of placing the action in the scenery instead of just showing it to us.<br/><br/>Nit-picking: I didn't think much of the title sequence with it's floating 3d text, other than using an old looking font - I didn't get the connection.

The director tried to pull a story out of a magic hat that never worked, nor did I give a rat's 'patoot' about the hero.<br/><br/>The depiction of the Picts was based on Roman accounts and the Romans were notorious for making things up about their enemies to get other conquered tribes to joins their battles and or to 'make excuses' for losses or military blunders.

"filipemanuelneto","9","3","7","25 January 2018"," Much more interesting than other similar (but more famous) films.
","This film is based on the mysterious disappearance of IX Legio Hispana, one of the Roman legions. We know that it remained a long time in Britain but it's disappearance from the records without any mention has elicited several speculations. This is precisely what this film does, creating a story where it takes advantage of the best known hypothesis for this disappearance: the massacre of this legion in combat. Many classicists disagree with this theory and you can find enough specialized literature on the subject by the hand of the most notable historians, but the fact is that the story created for this film is plausible, which helps to create a pleasant sense of historical accuracy, with some understandable yields when dramatic effect or pragmatic issues prevailed. One of the things that caught my attention was the crystalline similarity between the battle represented in the film and the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where General Varo lost his life and his legions in the time of Augustus. It was, in fact, a good action sequence, with touches of realism that only sinned by the exaggeration, of fake blood used.<br/><br/>The cast was very good. Michael Fassbender was very convincing in the role of a centurion, who survives the carnage and tries to return. Less happy was the idea of making each of the surviving soldiers come from a region of the empire. We have already seen this cliché previously, I believe it was used in the 2004 movie ""King Arthur"" but I may be wrong (I'm speaking from my fallible memory). Anyway, the idea sounded false. Dominic West, Ulrich Thomsen and Imogen Poots also did a good job but it was the sweeping performance of Olga Kurylenko who dominated the film. She played an extremely cruel and malicious Pictish woman who decided to dedicate her life to avenge herself on the Romans. This barbarian killing machine was an intense enemy and contrasts with the humanity of Poots character, a woman with a past of pain, but kind and of whom we instinctively like.<br/><br/>The production vallues and technical issues also seemed very good to me. In contrary to the current trend, the film virtually waived the green screen and filmed on location, which is a plus point. Action sequences and fights are good, realistic enough and only harmed, as I said, by exaggeration in false blood. It reminded me of the movie ""300"", where I criticized the emphasis on blood. Of course a battle needs blood but we cannot go into exaggerations, by excess or by defect. I really enjoyed the cinematography. She was able to convey the feel of the period as well as the intense cold that was felt. The color tones were excellent and the contrast adequate. The only negative note is the movie soundtrack. It fulfills its role but ends up being forgettable.<br/><br/>To summarize, this film is very good and considerably better than other films (""Braveheart"", ""King Arthur"" etc.) in the same style, but that ended up becoming more famous and having greater visibility. Historically realistic, it doesn't depict any historical fact but a theory, under discussion, so don't fully believe in the story the film tells, remember this is not a documentary. Entertaining, is a good movie for those who enjoy history and the Roman period, or simply for those who enjoy a good adventure or action film."
"novaweb-56967","2","3","7","1 May 2017"," almost couldn't be worse
","Cheaply made, predictable, bad special effects, painful acting...why does Fassbender make these films (avoid Assassin's Creed as well)? My gf and I started laughing at it got so predictable. Mostly I am not sure why this film needed to get made? - it just brings nothing to the screen. I think pre-dated GoT so it's not mining that vibe.

","What a waste of money this probably is. The movie looks expensive to be made, but the result is not good at all. The pictures of the landscapes are beautiful, the costumes look good, but the fighting and killing is so far over the top and just stupid and brutal. And the story is the worst part: very very very thin. It looks like there was no attempt made to wright a good story. It's just about shooting as many action scenes as possible, with as much (bloody) violence as possible. Just like movies as '300' you get a bit of a feeling that you are watching fascist-like violence tributes. Some scenes are so cliché and so stupid, you can't believe it was really meant that way. It's a pity, because it could have worked with a better story and a less over the top fighting. I love historic movies, especially about ancient Greece or Rome, but this was a big disappointment."
"Hey_Sweden","7","3","7","22 March 2012"," Another entertaining effort from ever reliable Neil Marshall.
","The director continues his successful string of titles - ""Dog Soldiers"", ""The Descent"", and ""Doomsday"" - with this stylish take on an old myth. Michael Fassbender, engaging as always, plays Quintus, a centurion with the Roman Army in 117 A.D. who survives an attack on his fort and subsequently takes part in a mission to eliminate the savage warriors known as the Picts. However, the troops get overwhelmed in unfamiliar territory, and Quintus and a select few others make it out alive, intent on rescuing their general (Dominic West) who was captured by the enemy. What Marshall does here is just dive head first into the action, getting any exposition out of the way as quickly as possible, easing us into more character oriented scenes as the story progresses. And the characters are a solidly entertaining bunch, with the effective twist that one of the main antagonists here is a female, the animal like warrior Etain, played by model / actress Olga Kurylenko, who's quite good in the part. The scenery is extremely breathtaking, with superb widescreen photography, and a colour style that mostly avoids brighter colours. This creates a wonderful visual contrast when the Roman troops are besieged by fireballs; the yellow & orange looks great amid the muted blues & greys, etc. The action is respectably intense, with a lot of digital blood spilled as various combatants brutalize each other. Fassbender is well supported by a cast including JJ Feild, David Morrissey, Liam Cunningham, and Noel Clarke as his comrades, as well as the lovely and appealing Imogen Poots as Arianne, ostracized from her fellow Picts, Ulrich Thomsen as Pict leader Gorlacon, and veterans Paul Freeman (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") as Governor Agricola, Andreas Wisniewski (""The Living Daylights"", ""Die Hard"") as Commander Gratus, and Michael Carter (""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Return of the Jedi"") as General Antoninus. The story here is pretty simple, but efficiently told and the movie does illustrate some of the horrors of war and fleshes out its characters as much as it can while still maintaining its basic visceral appeal. And the fact that it's inspired by history, when the 9th Legion of the Roman Army vanished in Hibernia, is intriguing and may make a viewer want to do a bit of reading on the subject. Overall, it shows once again Marshall's ability to craft good crowd pleasing diversions with a nice amount of pizazz. Seven out of 10."

","I have to say that I agree with ""westenicho"" and that users comments about user ""Russ-was-here"" comments. I do not see anywhere in the film makers write ups where it states this is a factual presentation, maybe based on historical events which means they could take one battle form one area and supplant it in another. So if you want a 100% factual representation of the time, this is not for you, what it is, is a great entertaining movie and factual enough to believe the characters and their trials and tribulations. I think the acting was superb and as much as it is not a movie for the Oscars, it is an entertaining movie for family, Sc-Fi, Historical, Roman, History, and Ancient U.K. and surrounds history. Not enough gore so as your 8 year old could not watch but enough so this 53 year old male could enjoy. So watch it for what it is, a tale of long ago and the way things where as seen by the writers and directors whom I thank for bring this film to my lounge room. The scenery is great as well as costumes (even if they are not 100% factual), just a great entertaining movie, worth watching. I have seen it 3 times now and think it is worth a good 8+ or in the movies an A- for acting, direction, filming and particularly Set and Costumes"
"Sulla-2","6","2","4","3 May 2011"," An entertaining action film
","The film is set in Roman Britain in 117AD when the Romans are having their usual problems with the Picts in Scotland. The hero. having escaped from the captivity of the picts, joins the 9th legion at York. The legion are ordered to destroy the picts but they are ambushed in a forest. A small group of survivors led by our Centurian hero, are unsuccessful in rescuing the legion commander and are subsequently chased by the picts throughout Scotland.<br/><br/>I would like to deal with the historical accuracy. The 9th legion was possibly lost in Scotland but it was not ordered there by the Governor Julius Agricola. He had left Britian about 30 years earlier after defeating the tribes in Scotlan. Hadrians wall was certainly not commenced immediately. The Roman forts would have been built surrounded by a deep ditch. The ditches were missing from these forts. The legion would have been accompanied by a large force of auxillaries. These were absent.<br/><br/>However it was an enjoyable albeit bloodthirsty, action romp."

","""Now she hunts Romans. Now we are the prey.""<br/><br/>Centurion isn't a historical epic, it's a historical action flick. You won't get the grandeur and scope of a movie like Gladiator, but if you're looking for some violence and would like to substitute swords and arrows for shotguns and Uzis, then you could do a lot worse. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender and Olga Kurylenko star on opposite sides of this movie. Fassbender is a Roman centurion in Britain who has been among the only survivors of two attacks by the warring Picts on his fellow soldiers. Kurylenko is a mute Pictish woman working with the Romans, who turns out to be more than she seems. Both of the stars prove credible in their action scenes, which are the main showpieces of the movie. <br/><br/>The battles are what you'd expect from (director) Neil Marshall - visceral, brutal, and with copious amounts of blood. They occur frequently, and they never fail to have a high body count. If you're at all familiar with the story/legend of the Ninth Legion (which Centurion was adapted from), then you know not to expect many of the main characters to survive. You also probably know that there really aren't any true ""good guys"". The Romans are fighting to control the territory they've conquered, and the Picts are fighting for revenge and freedom. Both sides do some terrible things, but the Romans are presented as our main characters here, and therefore, our protagonists. <br/><br/>This is a much more simple and conventional movie than Marshall's other work like The Descent and Doomsday, and it's probably his most mainstream flick, as well. But, there's nothing wrong with a straight-forward action movie if it's entertaining. I probably won't rush to own Centurion or see it again, but it was certainly worth seeing once. Fans of Imogen Poots will definitely want to check this out, as she has a nice (if somewhat brief) role."

","Legions, walking in the woods like primary school scouts, fighting using barbarian tactics more than barbarians, female warriors that are facing legions easily in tactical combat and close combat and women kicking ace of 100 pounds bigger men like in Jacky Chan movie ... all this stuff are decreasing the value of this movie. The other thing that might irritate you are special effects: ridiculous blood splashes in the battles like in some Tarantino movie. However, I found this movie still fun. Camera, costumes and acting are superb. The rhythm of the film is good so the director has overcome the problem of having a dry historical theme movie. What I also liked about the movie is that it shows historical balance as it was: Rome is not the light as in Gladiator but the brutal power that faces another brutal power. However, what this movie mainly keeps away from splendid flicks with of the same topic is lack of secondary plot as in Gladiator for example."
"amesmonde","Null","4","12","17 August 2010"," Breathtaking settings, bloody but hankered
","Talented and left of the middle director Neil Marshall returns with a 117 A.D story of a group of Roman soldiers who must fight for their lives as they are hunted down by the Picts the savage, elusive and remorseless inhabitants of Northern Britain.<br/><br/>In the vein of Beowulf & Grendel (2005) 13th Warrior (1999) and of course Gladiator (2000), Centurion oddly missed a long running large screen release. It has an excellent diverse cast ensemble, including Olga Kurylenko, Imogene Poots, David Morrissey and the great Liam Cunningham. With excellent make-up design, costumes and fantastic breathtaking settings, it's only hankered by some strained dialogue which lacks the conviction of that in the Black Death (2010).<br/><br/>Centurion is modest constructed period piece, there's Etain (Kurylenko) and Michael Fassbender's excellent performance as Quintus, violence, blood and decapitations. Supporting actors are the backbone with the likes of Axelle Carolyn and Dave Legeno to name a few but they are not given enough to do or say. You can forgive at times Ilan Eshkeri great, yet, at times intrusive theatrical score, as Marshall delivers some great set ups, action, the wolf hunt and ambush to name a few and Centurion grips you and creates tension like his unsurpassed earlier work.<br/><br/>There's lots of atmosphere created by the location shoot and visually Marshall delivers. Blood and gore lovers will eat this up."
"DrZom-77-388656","2","3","8","20 October 2016"," Do not look for history
","This movie is pure fantasy, with very little connection to history. <br/><br/>Yes, there was a Ninth Legion that was stationed in Britain. It disappeared from Roman records, but there is no evidence that it suffered the fate depicted in this move. There is no evidence that the makers of this movie cared about history at all.<br/><br/>The equipment was wrong. The Roman legionary on the march carried his kit suspended by a forked wooden pole over the shoulder, not a spear. He did carry one or two pilum, throwing javelins made of soft metal and a wooden haft, so that when thrown it would deform and not be thrown back by the enemy. <br/><br/>The tactics were wrong. The legionary fought with shield and gladius, a short sword used for stabbing, not slashing. What made the legions so effective was that the soldiers fought in close order, highly disciplined. The barbarians fought as individuals, slashing and flailing, not legionaries... except in this movie.<br/><br/>The premise of the plot is a total flight of fancy. It is chock full of predictable elements seen in countless movies. I highly recommend that you instead watch ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) for a gripping drama of a military expedition that faces disaster. Then watch ""Centurion"".<br/><br/>I give the movie a 2 instead of only a 1 because at least technically it is well made."
"zetes","5","3","8","6 December 2010"," Dull, ugly and mostly forgettable
","Director Neil Marshall showed a lot of promise with his sophomore feature, The Descent. It was far from perfect, but it was a rare horror movie that was actually frightening. Marshall has unfortunately not advanced any since then. His followup, Doomsday, was an okay B movie, but it was most definitely forgettable. Centurion, his fourth movie (I never have caught up with his debut, Dog Soldiers), is even worse than Doomsday. It's a story about a group of Roman soldiers, led by Michael Fassbender, caught behind enemy lines, trying to make their way to Hadrian's Wall before the Picts, led by mute tracker Olga Kurlyenko, hunt down and kill them. When it's nothing but running and chasing, it ain't half bad. Anything resembling plot, though, stinks. I could barely understand the mush-mouthed Brits that populate the movie (apparently the Romans were made up of Cockney bootblacks), and when the Picts are subtitled, the font and color of the subtitles are illegible. The film has that awful processed blue tint throughout, and the action is edited in such a way that it's often hard to follow (also: CGI blood)."

","I already had high expectations of this film because of The Descent, and Centurion lived up to them. It's inevitably going to be compared with Gladiator, but this is a different sort of movie. Smaller scale but no less sumptuous visually, this is an exhilarating action/chase movie with gorgeous (real) locations that make Scotland look as grand as Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The cast are uniformly excellent too, despite (or perhaps because of) harsh filming conditions in real snow in winter in the Scottish mountains.<br/><br/>Not for the squeamish - there's plenty of blood and carnage, as you'd expect from a Neil Marshall film.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended."

","First off the timing is completely wrong. The governor they claim at the time, had been dead for over ten years, the ninth has been discovered to have been in Germany when defeated, and picts are not full size Viking like warriors, they are short Pygmy type people. I need go no further for accuracy as there is none. The movie itself was good, if you don't get too technical. While I am of the reality type where women are physically weaker than men, because they are, I really like the blonde archer who seemed to enjoy the fight. The movie over all was good for having a bunch of ""Q"" listers for a cast. The king of the picts was a waste, he didn't even personally go after the guys who killed his like 9 year old son, instead sending a tongueless woman to do his dirty work. The whole thing stinks of political correctness, women who could kick larger men's asses, the one black guy in the whole movie, on and on."
"John-Athens","7","3","9","28 August 2010"," Blood and Mayhem
","Those who are fans of HBO's ""Rome,"" or Starz's ""Spartacus"" will be pleased with ""Centurion."" It doesn't have the narrative of ""Rome,"" nor the trashy-goodness of ""Spartacus,"" but what it takes from both of them is violence. And boy does it have a lot of it.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of roman soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, they must trek through enemy territory to rescue their general, Virilus (Dominic West), who was captured following an ambush. This group is lead by Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), who previously survived a raid on his fort by the Pictish, before escaping and being rescued by General Virilus and his 9th Legion. General Virilus, a man's man, was summoned by Julius Agricola (Paul Freeman), a Roman Governor. He was then given the task to go on the offensive, and wipe out the Picts, for no reason other than to help Julius return to Rome. It seems like this is the motive of EVERY Roman politician outside of Rome. Accompanying his legion is the female tracker, Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict herself who now helps the Romans (think Wes Studi in ""The Last of the Mohicans""). She may look pretty, but when she screams, you see how dirty her teeth are, and think to yourself ""I wouldn't want to kiss that."" <br/><br/>The plot is very solid, but nothing special and the cast do their best with the material. Voice-Over narration by Michael Fassbender's character, Quintus, is heard throughout the movie. It's not overly done, and serves it's purpose by giving us insight to Quintus. He's the typical roman soldier, honorable, yet filled with national pride. You have no problems rooting for him. Etain, has no tongue, so we don't have to hear Olga Kurlenko speak. All she has to do is make intimidating faces that look more cute than menacing. The rest of the cast is solid, and there's even a black guy in the legion! Guess what happens to him. Every roman solider speaks with an English accent, while the Picts sound Scottish. This isn't ""Mel Gibson's Centurion,"" so I have no problems with this. After all, this is an English speaking film. My only gripe is that not enough attention is paid to the characters before they start dying off.<br/><br/>Director Neil Marshall (The Descent) really knows how to give his films a sense of dread and unease. Like ""The Descent,"" the protagonists of ""Centurion"" are chased, and have to survive in an environment they know nothing about. This film is also gory as hell. Heads are not only decapitated, but are diagonally cut in half. Swords go through bodies like they're 99% liquid, and limbs are easily detachable. Hell, even being pushed into a tree while running will result in a blood splatter. One thing this film does not lack is ways to kill people. The kills are very much the highlight of this film, and the blood here is not as cartoonish as the blood in ""Spartacus."" Primarily shot in the forests of Hampshire, England, ""Centurion"" is very pleasant to look at; the cast is surrounded by tall trees, and snowy mountains. This accentuates the battle sequences and makes them more enjoyable.<br/><br/>""Centurion"" contains everything you expect in a film about Romans: blood, betrayal, even a hint of politics – but sorry, no sex. However it has a very by-the-books story, and it's characters lack emotion. Aside from Quintus, it's hard to feel for any character, but the movie doesn't care about that. It's a gritty period action flick, and if you like violent deaths, you won't care either."

It's Fassbenders mission to locate them or the eagle. <br/><br/>Kurylenko plays Etain and doesn't say a single word throughout the whole movie, thanks to a brutal torture inflicted by the Romans, instead her facial expressions have to convey everything she is feeling and she handles the role with amazing skill that I never thought she had.<br/><br/>I give this 8/10, not for the storyline which is derivative and dull but simply for Fassbender and especially Kurylenko who shows what great acting is all about."

","117 A.D. Rome wants Britain, but it looks like that won't happen. The Picts are holding on to it hard, with guerrilla warfare, that the legions were not used to. But maybe one last attack can do it. The spirited, short-tempered General Virilus(West, clearly enjoying himself) who is part of, not only leading, his own platoon is sent out, and on the way, he meets Centurion Dias(Fassbender, determined and somewhat brooding, without being dull and grating). Though aided by the mute, excellent tracker Etain(Kurylenko, her entire performance via body language and facial expressions, and shining), they soon find themselves on the run. Can they possibly escape alive?<br/><br/>A fast-paced 90 minutes(94 with credits) of chase film with frequent fight scenes - every time you think you know what's going to happen next, you're stunned by where it goes instead. The battles are chaotic without us losing track of basically what's going on, and, like the rest of this, brutal, intense and realistic(except for the ending, where some Hollywood creeps in, and some of the moral grey areas are moved towards being black and white). The dry, macho humor/dialog feel endemic to the soldier environment, and the fleshed out characters(yes, that includes the ""villains"") are consistent in their behaviour. One can almost feel the frostbite and hypothermia shooting on location in the harsh nature led to through the screen. This is a compelling take on what might have happened to the historical group. The sparse narration doesn't really add anything, and comes across as a late addition by a producer who worried audiences wouldn't get what had just been established if our protagonist didn't briefly monologue about it.<br/><br/>In addition to what I've already mentioned, this contains a lot of strong language including non-graphic descriptions of disturbing sexual situations. The DVD comes with 8 minutes of good deleted scenes, 6 and a half minutes of hit and miss outtakes, a fine 4 minute featurette, and trailers for Buried, Saw 3D, Get Low, 22 Bullets, Micmacs, The kids are all right and this.

","Review: Although this movie is nearly 3 years old, I quite enjoyed this medieval ""On The Run"", film which has good performances from all of the cast and a decent storyline. I must admit, I was expecting a more ""Sparta"" type of movie, but I did stay interested throughout the movie and, for once, I didn't fall asleep. The reason why I didn't see the film when it first came out was because I wasn't a big fan of movies in this genre, but after becoming a big fan of The Game Of Thrones, I thought that I would give this movie a go. There is a lot of running throughout the film and the violence was a bit extreme, but it made the film more intense and enjoyable. If you didn't catch this movie when it first came out then you should give it a watch. <br/><br/>Round-Up: I've gradually became quite a fan of Michael Fassbender, who has w unique style of acting which suite most of films that he has acted in like Prometheus and X-Men: First Class. It did seem like the director was getting as much English actors as possible because Noel Clarke and Riz Ahmed was a weird choice for the movie, but I did like there characters. Dominic West, from the Wire, played a great king and I liked Liam Cunningham who is also in the Game Of Thrones. After watching the making of the movie, it was good to see that the director didn't rely on CGI, which a lot of people do nowadays, and a lot of the action looked pretty real. In all, its worth a watch.<br/><br/>Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $7million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there medieval movie based around the Roman Empire days. 5/10"

I can only surmise that people that didn't like it don't like the genre. For example, I have never seen a romantic comedy that I like, so I could never rate one highly. Similarly, the detractors of this film have their own preferences.<br/><br/>Some people hate cowboy films, some hate historical re-enactments.<br/><br/>Besides others saying the clothing is historically inaccurate, the movie is still enjoyable, and yes, there will be some guesswork as to what actually happened.

","You don't see too many movies within this time period and setting, and very few involving Ancient Rome to begin with. Overall, this movie was great to watch, though it was more on the entertainment aspect (there weren't too many historical errors either, which is something I really pay attention to). The reasoning behind giving it a 7-star review is the fact that some of the scenes are just sort of awkward, with unusual transitions or something of the sort. Acting-wise, I felt that it had a great selection of cast members, especially Liam Cunningham (I loved his part playing Davos Seaworthy in the HBO series based on A Song of Ice and Fire)! And of course, how can anyone forget Michael Fassbender? Aside from the few inept scenes, this should absolutely be a recommended film to watch, especially while it's still on Netflix Instant!"

","Centurion is a pretty good period movie based in the wilds of Great Britian during the days of the Roman Empire. As far as the history presented and if it stayed true as far as weapons, costumes, the Picts, I don't know, but for me it was a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender is a pretty good actor and did a decent job as the Leader character, the Centurion Quintus Dias. The whole movie centers around the surviving Roman soldiers of an ambush being ruthlessly pursued, behind enemy lines, by their enemy the Picts, and there vengeful female tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko). Kurylenko's character has a backstory, and she doesn't speak at all in the movie. I will say that she did a decent job with a non speaking part, and as gritty as this movie is, she is definitely a great piece of eye candy.<br/><br/>Overall it was a gritty movie, the costumes were pretty good the locations were great, and the story was decent. I hear the budget was pretty low for this movie, if so they did a pretty darn good job with what they had.<br/><br/>It isn't going to be the best movie you ever see, but it does succeed a bit more than others such as the deplorable Channing Tatum movie, The Eagle."

","The bloody gruesome action is expertly handled. WIth every head slice, throat cut, causing flinches and manly air pumps. The cast are a wonderful mix of up and comers, and recently established stars. Marshall has basically made a Roman version of Dog Soldiers, as a band of survivors all get together to outmaneuver an enemy. Despite these enemies being human, Marshall still decides to make them grotesque and cruel. The male bonding moments are still here, as are the strong female characters. It does hint towards people fighting their own wars based on emotion, but it's the violence everyone came to see. It isn't quite enough to really justify a watch. The parts in between are dull and there's no real progression after the first 30 minutes."
"bth2004","7","2","5","23 December 2011"," Very pleasantly surprised
","Let me start off by saying that the last period piece I saw before this movie (both of them on movie channels) was ""Valhalla Rising"" and I was nearly sickened by the experience. So I was a little apprehensive going into ""Centurion"". Thankfully, it gave me a very enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>Plot, I have to say, was not the most original thing; it wasn't that weak, either. After two very bad defeats at the hands of the Picts, a Roman officer and his small band of survivors have to survive in the wilderness of Britain as they evade a band of Pict trackers--on orders from their king to avenge the death of his son at Roman hands. The Picts hound the Romans over much of the isle of Britain, it seems, and are never far away, always finding them again and again, each time taking more Roman lives. The Roman party are sheltered by a local woman--an outcast from Pict culture, therefore leaving her with little loyalty to anybody; their mutual kindness and understanding of each other's situations makes room for some feelings to develop--no sex or anything, sorry boys. After a final confrontation with the Picts, the last 3 arrive at a new garrison the legion has established--the beginning stages of Hadrian's wall. One of the men is killed by garrison guards who thought he was a Pict; the other is killed in a fight with the centurion because it was he who killed the Pict king's son. After the centurion gives his report, he has to evade his own people who try to kill him in order to save face. So, being wounded, he returns to the British woman who gave him shelter earlier.<br/><br/>Acting was really good the whole way through. The film doesn't allow for a whole lot of character development, but all of the characters are believable and well portrayed. Most surprising is the Pict lead tracker: a mute woman with a spear and a heart like a flaming tar pit. It has been a while since a woman was so scary on screen--and we thank her for it! <br/><br/>Effects were well done, but not overdone. Some of the blood was done with CGI--mainly in the battle scenes, not so much with the small group fights; when they do physical blood effects, it gets pretty gory in a couple of places. Gorgeous cinematography and landscaping--you really feel sorry for the Romans traipsing about Britain in winter without furs to wear! <br/><br/>All in all, a very good watch. I highly recommend it for anybody who is a fan of action and period pieces. It likely is historically inaccurate on a number of points, but that's OK; if you're a stickler, feel free to take notes.

"puabi","Null","2","5","12 August 2011"," Why I stopped watching
","I am glad they tried to make a movie like this. I want there to be movies about Dark Ages Britain, and historical movies in general. But here is why I stopped watching: 1) The ridiculous inclusion of a female warrior. I am so sick of unrealistic portrayals of them. This girl looks like she weighs 110 pounds. She puts on nice eyeshadow makeup. And she whips Domenic West's ass. She has this commanding warrior badass presence that, let's be realistic, no woman would be able to have had in 117 AD, and which lots of buff dudes probably didn't have then either. I am tired of gritty, but not gritty enough. DO you want to be gritty? Show how this female warrior is beat up by a guy. That is what really would happen. Better yet, show how she uses other abilities than strength, such as cunning, trickery, and her wits, to survive. That is what real women had to do back then, in a addition maybe to a bit of opportunistic backstabbing if necessary. Well, Because they tended not to wield weapons for a reason. That reason being, they are just not as strong! N.b. I am a woman myself, but I think all this warrior girl crap is just too much clichÃ© now. Let's make it realistic! Make the girl big and strapping at least!! 2) The makeup. I am so sick of the Picts painted blue. It just looked bad. Maybe it didn't look home-made enough.... I don't know. I know that is their characteristic but.... Also! They should have been made to speak Welsh and not Scots Gaelic.<br/><br/>3) The cheezy dialogue. I winced. (Interactions between the soldiers, etc) Because I heard what they were trying to do, and sometimes it seemed so nice! They were trying to give a good feel for the time. And they failed! Something was just missing. They needed me on their scriptwriting team.<br/><br/>4) I already said it sort of above, but this was NOT GRITTY ENOUGH. I want to feel like I am in this time period and things in this movie seemed either silly (heads splattering everywhere, much more easily than they would in real life), or halfassed. I never lost myself in this movie and felt like I was somewhere else. I always felt like I was a 21st century person watching a corny 21st century rendition of... something.... People running a lot across nice landscapes.... etc...."

","I read the reviews beforehand so I wasn't expecting anything absolutely historically accurate. After all, we're unlikely to ever know what happened to the Ninth Legion anyway apart from the fact that it never returned (if it was actually the Ninth that disappeared north of the border), however, what irks me are the things that, at a very minimum, the movie makers can afford to get right such as Roman weapons and tactics.<br/><br/>Firstly, the Gladius was a stabbing sword. Legionaries did not line up and slog it out with their enemies like Gladiators in the Circus, They stood three or four deep, shields raised and stabbed at their opponents' genitalia or femoral arteries or tried to slice through their Achilles tendons. The whole effect was much like a buzz saw as their swords stabbed and withdrew, stabbed and withdrew, etc. trying to find their mark. When the front rank tired, was injured or killed, the man behind took his place, or was issued an order to that effect.<br/><br/>Secondly, I am sure I am not the only one who is sick and tired of seeing a spear of some unknown era with a blunt tip in the hand of a Roman soldier. The armourer for this movie should be ashamed! Where is the Pilum with the slender shaft and the small sharp tip? (no jokes please). It doesn't look at all like the spears in this movie.<br/><br/>In summary, it was some fun for 90 minutes but that's all folks!"

","I, along with some others, feel this movie was very realistic in almost every aspect relating to the location and period.

Unfortunately, there were moments in the film I felt were to easily anticipated, but all-in-all they were easily forgotten due to the gorgeous scenery and defined plot. Thank God they had enough sense to not add one of those ridiculous gratuitous sex scenes which seem to appear in practically every Hollywood movie of recent years! (I hope that information isn't considered a ""spoiler"". This is my first submission.) Far too many movies lose their entire head of steam with such absurdity. At least in foreign film any love scenes are essential to the plot and portrayed realistically. Of course, most Americans are so anal they cannot see past their self- appointed Moral Code!!!"

","The argument is simple: Agricola, Roman Governor of Brittannia wants to look good with his superiors in Rome and get rid once and for all of the Picts, a savage northern tribe of warriors who do not accept roman rule. The 9th Legion, commandeered by Dominic West, tries to do the job by penetrating far into the Pict lines, but it is ambushed and pretty much wiped off the planet by the savage picts. The rest of the Story is just a chase motivated by revenge, in which a group of Pict warriors and scouts led by a quite frightful woman hunt the few remaining survivors of the 9th legion, who are determined to get back to safety and arrive to Roman controlled lands. <br/><br/>Good points: 1. The story is honest, simple and well told. 2. The fighting scenes are very good quality. 3. The movie keeps always the interest and is very interesting, as you never know whether the Romans will make it back to camp or not. 4. The acting is decent<br/><br/>Bad Points: it lacks historical credibility, and the script has a couple of big mistakes, and a far from satisfactory ending, which is very quick and a bit of a nonsense.<br/><br/>However, all in all, this movie is pretty good fun, good acting, a lot of tension and emotion, as people are always fighting on the run, and the scenery and atmosphere are very good. So, it is far from a masterpiece, but it is actually a pretty good movie to watch, highly entertaining. There are warrior women, good fights, lots of blood and violence in a somewhat ""primitive gory style"", and even the occasional extremely beautiful woman. So, this is one we can all watch and do not feel disappointed. As said, it is not brilliant, but it is quite a good one actually."

","Well 20 minutes into this movie I had no idea if I wanted to turn it off or keep watching, I went with the latter of the two and don't regret it. Michael Fassbender who I first noticed in the movie ""300"" does a great job with his role and is probably the best part of the movie. The faults within the movie has nothing to do with the acting or even the directing it's more about the screenplay, it almost seemed to simple for this type of movie.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for good action scenes even when most nowadays are ridiculous and completely unbelievable and it's easy to notice here that Neil Marshall focused more on the action then the storyline. Now don't get me wrong I was a fan of ""Dog Soldiers"" and thought ""The Descent"" was one of the best movies of the year. However it seems here that he just wanted to make a bloody action movie. The thing that makes a movie like ""Kingdom of Heaven"" or ""Spartacus"" a great movie is not putting the action ahead of the story or characters. Honestly part of the way through I kind of forgot that this is suppose to be a historical drama.<br/><br/>Don't take this the wrong way I enjoyed what I saw I like action movies, I just don't like a movie trying to be something it's not. This movie is a good action movie and perhaps the Roman backdrop was a good idea, I haven't completely decided yet.<br/><br/>It's up to you though what you think and if this is your type of movie. I was in Chicago when Neil Marshall was promoting this movie and got to sit in on a Q&A with him at a convention. It seemed he did a lot of research and knew what he was talking about in regards to Roman history and the occupation of Britain. So maybe I missed something."

It was beautifully shot, with impressive costumes, makeup and some not-bad acting. It's a pity this seemed like a really expensive low budget hack and slash film (if that makes any sense). The characters didn't really develop, and to be blunt, there wasn't a lot of heart in them to begin with. I never thought I was looking at real people. I could tell the actors were doing the best with what they had, but that never appeared to be too much.

If you were in the cold northern woods of Briton, wouldn't you need that extra layer of fat to survive and wouldn't your face be weathered? Obviously the director has a thing for models, as you can see from his other works like THE DESCENT. But here, a 115 lbs model throwing an axe around? Give me a break. Other than that, there's nothing cooler than seeing Roman Legionnaires in fur capes set against the snow capped mountains of Scotland. Only one other movie has that epic proportion feel (FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE).<br/><br/>PROs: 1. No good guys. Romans are just as vicious as the barbarians.

"aldebaran68","3","2","6","21 May 2019"," Basically uninteresting...
","I had watched The Eagle before watching Centurion, so I'm biased as I enjoyed the Eagle and would buy it on DVD.
Centurion did not impress me. I'm not a historian so I won't go into too much detail. One goof mentioned was the riders using stirrups. These were not invented in Roman times so not used. It is difficult to criticise reconstructions of the Picts as we know virtually nothing about them. Its good they had the Picts speak Scots Gaelic as some level of ancient tribal can be imagined from this. Its a shame they couldn't have the Romans speaking Latin, but there we go.<br/><br/>One major error was that they had Arianna 'exiled for witchcraft'. In those days before the Roman Empire became Christian, and even for some time after, all the peoples of Europe were tribal shamanic, and witchcraft would have been normal. Even the Romans had their own forms of this, in their deities, temples and rituals. So she would not have been exiled for witchcraft. this was not yet a Christian Empire and the Picts were certainly not Christians.<br/><br/>He had the Romans bantering like British soldiers. Romans were not British. They may have been Italic, or Hispanic or Germanic, but British as in the modern British soldier, did not exist then. So his representation of Roman soldiery would have been better based on how Spanish, or Italian or French or Greek soldiers interact. Cultural differences are important, esp. 2000 yrs ago. The Eagle made such interactions more 'neutral' so that culture did not enter into it so much.<br/><br/>OK, it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been a lot better, more engrossing. I found none of the cast esp/ likeable or sympathetic. I guess some succeed and other don't. I might have given it 4 stars but the historical inaccuracies were a bit too glaring, and I just didn't enjoy it. IMHO, The Eagle is a much better story, much more enjoyably told."

","An over-extended Empire. Its troops stationed on the far frontier, not really understanding why they're there in a place they don't understand, don't care about and just want to get out of so that they can return home. An enemy that's simply relentless and will not give up. A politician who just wants to make a name for himself so that he can get back into the halls of power and isn't above covering up uncomfortable truths. It could be about the beginning of the end for any number of Empires throughout history - including the current American Empire. In that sense, I see this story as a sort of parable; a reflection of today's world put into a very different context. To that extent, it has some - some very little, mind you - point to it.<br/><br/>The context of the movie is actually the Roman Empire, and Roman troops stationed and fighting on the extreme northern frontier of the Empire, in Britannia. It's before the construction of Hadrian's Wall, and the Ninth Legion is in Pict territory (basically, Scotland) and is finding itself unable to subdue the pesky Picts. The movie is based on a legend about the Ninth Legion, which did in fact disappear from Roman history sometimes in the 2nd century (and many historians do believe it perished in Britannia.) It's a very violent, very bloody and very graphic movie. If you like those things you'll love this. The story is pretty bare bones and unimaginative really. After a fierce (violent, bloody and graphic) battle against the local Picts, what's left of the Ninth Legion (and it ain't much) has to try to find its way back to the safety of the Roman lines, all the while being hunted down by the Picts. After all that the movie chose to end on what I found to be an awkward romantic note that just didn't fit with the whole tenor of the story.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender starred in this as the commander of the ragged troops trying to find their way home. He was decent enough, but the whole tenor of the movie was its graphic bloodiness with a handful of ""gross-out"" scenes - such as the survivors killing a deer and drinking its blood and eating half digested moss from its stomach. I'd have to give some marks to Olga Kurylenko for her silent performance as Etain - the Pict scout who's out for revenge because years before the Romans killed her father, raped and killed her mother and raped her and cut her tongue out. Her ""Etain"" was not someone I'd want to cross!<br/><br/>But you'd really have to like blood and gore with only a very limited storyline to make this worth watching. (2/10)"
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","2","6","11 August 2015"," Terrific tale
","Neill Marshall's Centurion is a brutal, streamlined, balls to the wall story of several lost members of a Roman legion trying to survive the elements, ruthless enemy forces, and each other. It's not so much a sweeping, epic piece like 300, Troy or ones like that, but a more intimate, individualistic take on it. It's like the Bourne Identity of the sword flicks, all tooth and nail survival action as opposed to large scale battle sequences. Michael Fassbender plays , a centurion whose legion is decimated by a rogue group of fierce picts, led by Etienne (Olga Kurylenko in full beast mode). Their commander (Dominic West) can't hold the stragglers together, and soon a group of five or six of them are forced to hurdle through the barren, snowy terrain in hopes of escape from their relentless, pelt wearing pursuers. West is killer good in the few scenes he has, peppering his mannerisms and dialogue with a belligerent glint in his eye. Fassbender makes a stalwart protagonist. The gorgeous Imogen Pootds, a relative newcomer when this was released, is radiant as a forest dwelling loner who takes the gaggle of survivors in and cares for them. Liam Cunningham underplays his ageing soldier role beautifully. The camera work is also to be noted, capturing some stunning fight scenes set atop a snow dusted plateau, and later an abandoned keep. It's a fairly underrated slice of bloody genre fun, with Marshall being no stranger to this sort of breathless escapism, and having helmed the pilot of Game Of Thrones, adding all the right touches to make it well worth our while."
"spikenard222","5","2","6","16 June 2012"," Morally confusing, lots of gaffes
","It's a fun movie to watch, but there are lots of little gaffes, some of which are probably because of budgeting. For instance, 3000 Roman soldiers march into enemy territory....with no supplies. Oh, there are two wagons, haha, but a Roman soldier actually carried a lot of gear. Here, they just stomp around with their weapons; the costume budget probably couldn't provide for all the gear etc... The whole fireball thing mystified me....what were the balls? How did they light them? Smaller details that could have been more accurate: Romans primarily stabbed with the gladius, aiming at eyes, throats, hands, etc; here they swing them about like mighty claymores, slicing off heads and limbs. Or again, Roman armor would have provided far more protection against the inferior Pict weaponry that we see in this film. The *idea* of the ambush, however, seems inspired by the actual historical debacle of Teutoberg Forest, so I get that, and think that was a pretty good idea to link a known incident with the mystery of the 9th Legion's disappearance in history.<br/><br/>More seriously and I think fatal to the film, the plot is morally confused as to whom we should sympathize with. Initially, we're supposed to root for the Roman survivors, who were led into ambush by a traitor. But then we see some of the Romans threatening to ditch others, and one of them does sacrifice his comrade to wolves to save his own skin. Meanwhile, Etain turns out to be a victim of horrible Roman atrocities in the past. So, actually, I found myself sympathizing with Etain and the Picts, not the Romans, at which point I was pretty confused. In fact, I think the plot really missed a golden opportunity at the end. It should have been Etain who killed the Roman that killed the king's boy. Furthermore, I think she should have had an opportunity to kill Diaz but display mercy instead; or vice versa (in which she would experience mercy instead of crime at the hands of a Roman). Indeed, it felt wrong to kill Etain at the end, even if it was in self-defense. (Perhaps this results from the film trying to please everyone and offend no one. The film is a bit too PC, anachronistically inserting female ""Amazon"" Pict warriors going toe-to-toe with professional Roman soldiers, and a multi-racial Roman force surely calculated to appeal to international theater audiences. Are the Picts good? Bad? Are the Romans good? Bad? It's all muddled, which makes the film muddled.) That wolf scene, by the way, was completely laughable. Why would wolves spend precious energy chasing two healthy, armed humans for hours, even days? Other oddities: How can Etain smell the Romans across a valley, but can't smell them when they are underneath the floor she is standing on? Why do the Romans on the wall shoot the approaching Roman survivor, but apparently don't shoot Quintus? And wouldn't the Roman riding towards the wall *clearly see* that the soldier on the wall was aiming a bow and arrow at him? lol The whole Arianne/witch scene really interrupted the flow of a ""chase"" movie. The film struggled to transition back to the sense of urgency. But at least they don't get too involved with the romance subplot. Mercifully, there is no lusty, passionate sex scene!<br/><br/>On the plus side, the dialogue, though modern, is rough and tumble, like you would expect in an army. And there are several humorous exchanges, my favorite being when Etain punches a Roman in the crotch, and one of his comrades jokes that she must be a great scout if she was able to find his you know what lol"
"freemantle_uk","8","2","6","26 November 2011"," 'I am a soldier of Rome! I will not yield!'
","Because of the disaster that was Doomsday Neil Marshall's reputation as a director took a bit of a dent. To rectify this he turned to a completely different genre, a historical epic based on the legend of the Ninth Legion of Rome who disappeared in Scotland.<br/><br/>In 117AD the Roman Empire are fighting a loosing battle in their most northern frontier in Scotland, then known as Caledonia. The Picts, lead by their king Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen) has been leading a brutal guerrilla campaign against the Romans and during a raid capture our protagonist, Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender). In Roman occupied England General Titus Flavius (Dominic West) and the Ninth Legion has been ordered to invade and find Gorlacon. But they are lead into a trap and only a small band survive, including Quintus who the legion rescues. Quintus and the soldiers have to get back to Roman territory whilst being chased by Gorlacon and tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko) who are out for revenge.<br/><br/>Marshall sets out to give Centurion an earthy look, colours of outfits are toned down, his camera filters give the film a deliberately dark and grainy look and the whole movie was shot on location in muddy woods and fields in winter. But as a man from a horror background Marshall ensures there is a lot of gore and blood. It's a little over the top but it is fun to see and Marshall is certainly inventive involving methods of death. The battle scenes are deliberately chaotic and feels and looks like the opening from Gladiator. We are brought into the heart of a battle and it was very well done considering the budget. But whilst the battles were well done the one on one fights were too choppy and quickly cut. It was hard to tell what was happening. I prefer to actually see fights, have shots that last more then a second or two and keep cuts to a minimum. Marshall and his cinematography Sam McCurdy also employ some sweeping shots of the mountains and the landscape, particularly looking at the ground with a bird's eye view then panning the camera upwards. It was much very like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings to show the breathtaking scenery and how small the figures are in the wide expands. I expect that Marshall was trying to do for Scotland what Peter Jackson did for his native New Zealand.<br/><br/>The story overall is simple but simple does not mean bad. It is still has a manner of life and death for the Romans and Marshall certainly makes a very fast paced adventure. But Marshall also does allow us to get to the know the characters and he employs a strong cast, Fassbender, West, Imogen Poots, David Morissey and Riz Ahmed. Added to that Marshall attempts to show a more complex picture, that both sides are as brutal as each other, that the Picts want to humiliate the Romans, that the Romans are very brutal occupiers using violence and rape to enforce their rule, that the governor is thinking of his political position and that sides think what they are doing is right. No one is being evil just for the sake of being evil like in the God awful Braveheart and that there are tensions within both camps. It was a mix picture and no one is truly a good or bad guy for most of the film.<br/><br/>Since the success of the awesomely entertaining 300 there has been a big expansion of historically set action films, Black Death, Clash of the Titans, Solomon Kane, Ironclad, Immortals and many foreign efforts. Centurion is the best post 300 film within the genre so far, a competently made actioneer.<br/><br/>Historically it most like that the Ninth Legion was transferred to Germany and then either disbanded or amalgamated with another legion. But compared to the God Awful Braveheart Centurion is like Downfall for historical actuality.<br/><br/>Overall Centurion is very enjoyable and deserves a 7.5 out of 10."

"p-stepien","4","2","6","22 January 2011"," Tedious and predictable affair
","Neil Marshall's attempted portrayal of the popular legend of the disappearance of the roman Ninth Legion is a tedious and predictable affair, which seems all too focused on splurting out CGI blood, than on captivating the thrill of the hunt and the adrenaline of the chase. In this version of the myth the entire Legion gets massacred by the Picts, whilst trying to capture their leader Gorlacon (Ulrish Thomsen). Ambushed they are swiftly cut down with only a handful of men surviving. Led by Centurion Quintus Dias they aim to escape from Pict territory in an attempt to return home. Unfortunately for them the Pict's vengeance knows no bound and they are followed by the beautiful and deadly mute Etain (Olga Kurylenko).<br/><br/>The spectacular fail of this movie largely lies in the general misdirection. And this despite the actors, who are almost unanimously spot on and without any fault. Michael Fassbender especially has an unbelievable screen presence, which seems to make him destined for international film glory. Nonetheless the characters lack background and focus making the whole affair of their deaths rather disengaging.<br/><br/>Warning signs can be caught very early on in the movie, as the historical drama starts off with eagle-eye landscapes of Northern Scotland with humongous corny credits overshadowing the pictures. Than we are treated with a mindgulfingly useless opening scene, where we see a lone man escaping through the mountains coupled with an appallingly daft voice-over (which gets even worse as the movie plods on). After this the movie moves back in time two weeks to 'where this all started', only to be back in the mountains scene within 10 minutes of the film (making the whole opening sequence superfluous). In the meantime we get a bloody visceral fight, where Picts slaughter a Roman stronghold with extremely red CGI blood splattering left and right.<br/><br/>Naturally the above is just nitpicking, but the movie is a chaotic mess of some inspired scenes overshadowed by overall crappiness and very bad scripting. Something that not even the brilliance of Fassbender or the beauty of Kurylenko can overshadow. Not exactly knowing if this is a survival thriller, a historical drama or basically a glorious opportunity to hand out some in-your-face carnage the movie is all over the place. My standout scene of badness would have to be finding out that this is no ordinary band of survivors, but a band of unwilling supermen with a Greek cook with remarkable killing skills taking the cake. A close second would have to be a tribute to ""Return of the King"" with the group of legionnaires running on foot for several days straight with almost no food or rest putting to shame all the modern day marathon runners...<br/><br/>Surprisingly the movie is also unable to instill any sense of urgency or dread, although we have a group of people on foot escaping horsemen. Theorethically we know they are being chased, but Marshall can never seem to suggest scenes that start the blood pumping and keep you on the edge of your seat. Its quite a terrible achievement to shoot a movie about survival, but never being able to create an atmosphere of impeding death. Surprising given this is the same man who made the gripping ""Descent"".<br/><br/>Just to be brutally frank I was also taken aback with Hadrian's Wall showing up in the final minutes of the movie, whilst the film is supposedly set in 117 AD.<br/><br/>After the absolute (albeit enjoyable) muddle that was ""Doomsday"" Neil Marshall craps out a real turd and seems to be on a downhill spiral, which hopefully will force him to get back to the basics."

","I feel lit necessary to state that I am writing this review because I watched this movie in a ""Rome and Greece in Film and Pop Culture"" class; however, I could not disagree more with the amateurish analysis the course provided. The teacher has a strong affinity for Ridley Scott's Gladiator, and as this film was screened following Gladiator we spent the first rounds of discussion comparing the two. As the class knew the teacher's love for ""Gladiator"" the discussion quickly became a hate fest on ""Centurion"" and a blind worshiping of ""Gladiator."" First I would like to officially clarify that ""Gladiator"" is the more entertaining and in many respects the superior movie; however for the purposes of the class we are to analyze, not only the cinematic aspects of the movie, but what the movie is indirectly saying about the viewing audience (in our case the USA). Viewing the movies from this angle I find it utterly indefensible to claim that Gladiator is anything more than a good movie in a purely entertaining sense. The historical inaccuracies from dress to plot viability of Gladiator leave it useless in the ways of historical analysis; furthermore, ""Centurion"" as unrealistic as it may be, cannot be analyzed in the same light as there is a legitimate mystery concerning the fate of the 9th legion. Where ""Centurion"" far exceeds ""Gladiator"" is in what we the audience can take away from it. While ""Gladiator""(2000) has an interesting plot and a logical catharsis ""Centurion""(2010) has a great deal to say about not only the nature of man, but also the political position that the United States found itself in. As is often the case Roman movies are a prism through which we analyze the values of our own empire. It is hard to watch ""Centurion"" and not pick up on the commentary it lays out on the war on terror that the US finds itself engaged in. The movie hits on the different warfare: not a war of expansion or conquest, but a war of suppression and occupation. By the end of the movie the differences between Roman and Picts (Proto-Scotts?) have been reduced to nothing. Some Romans are depicted as irreparably shitty(Thax) while even the most bloodthirsty Picts have their motivations explained and understood. The final scene with Bothos being mistakenly shot, Fassbender being betrayed redundantly and finally returning to the only attractive witch drives home the message that ""everyone is a person regardless of homeland or creed, and all we can do is behave, at all times, in an honorable and prudent fashion."" Having a deceptively thoughtful movie be so misrepresented by classmates, whom literally in the same breath denounce Quentin Tarantino, necessitated a response though I would have been overruled in such a den of mediocrity."
"nogodnomasters","4","2","7","8 May 2018"," NO HISTORIANS ON THE SET, PLEASE!
","This film is a me-too movie attempting to capitalize off the success of pseudo histories such as Robin Hood and Arthur. My first objection to the movie is the font they chose to write the subtitles, locations, and plot points. It was difficult to read on my analog TV, especially when they opt for white on a pale blue background using an ancient looking font that is difficult to decipher in the first place. Now the reason why we have subtitles is for the Picts, who are native of Northern Britain. They don't speak English, but the Romans speak 21st century English, including one soldier with a British accent. ""Sorry mate, but orders are orders,"" he says as he slices a Pict throat. OH PLEASE! If the Picts don't speak modern English, don't try to make it realistic with subtitles only to have the Romans speak English. The language spoken by the Picts is actually unknown.<br/><br/>A Roman governor wanting to make a name for himself, opts to send the 9th Roman legion into the Pict stronghold in order to kill their king. The Roman governor uses a female Pict slave (whose parents were murdered by Romans, with her being raped as a child and her tongue cut out) to guild them into Pict territory. Guess how that works out Scooby-Doo? The ninth legion is wiped out except for the general who is taken captive and 7 Romans (who look more like an international group). They opt to do the stupid thing and attempt to rescue the general in the heart of a Pict camp. After they fail at that, they are hunted by Picts. For those who like killing, blood, urine, and violence this is your film. The overly simplistic plot, lack of good characterization, making us identify with the bad guys who we know will lose, poor attempts at humor, makes this the least enjoyable of the pseudo histories to date. They spent a lot of money making this film and wasted it on an inferior script.<br/><br/>The story of the missing ninth Roman legion being destroyed by the Picts is legend. It actually got transferred to Judea."

","The trajectory of Neil Marshall's output follows - not surprisingly - a smoothly descending curve. It starts relatively high with ""Dog Soldiers"", a rather likable small eclectic werewolf horror, both witty and gritty, including a delicious postscript joke. With his next picture, aptly named ""The Descent"", Marshall moves to the quasi United States and, leaving his sense of humour at home, descends into the more profitable realm of mainstream shockers. He remains faithful to the well-tried plot : this time it's a bunch of bored, adrenalin-hungry female aliens who invade the underground territory of mutant ""natives"", thus making themselves to titbits for creatures who prefer human flesh to adrenalin. The director's heart seems to contradict his critical standpoint - it's rather with the neocolonialist chicks (= the viewer's Ego ?), portraying the other side (= repressed Id ?) as repulsive lower beings deserving no mercy when confronted eye to eye.<br/><br/>However deep the Appalachian caves in ""The Descent"" might be, Marshall proves that a director of his calibre can get even lower - returning to the Highlands of Scotland for a change, where his fourth and last cinematic massacre, ""The Centurion"", takes place. It's not hard to predict what expects us here. A unit of Roman legionaries, veritable vessels of testosterone indeed, who have taken part in the Great Conquest of Cavemanland, are bound to be slaughtered by native Picts led by a female avenger gone berserk.<br/><br/>The movie, in the wake of its countless Hollywood big brothers, typically sits on the fence : the makers themselves seem to be drunk to near-unconsciousness by the machismo violence which they flaunt while exposing our voyeuristic, narcissistic and xenophobic selves. Moreover, they offer not a single pleasant surprise, just all imaginable clichés in full display ; tasteless casting, lacklustre script/dialogues, obligatorily muted colours, CGI blood spurts - signature of illiterates for a long time now - etc., etc. In the final third ""Centurion"" betrays even itself, changing horses from the naturalistic brute raven stallion to the white horse of a ludicrous sentimental romance.<br/><br/>Despite all flaws, there's at least one redeeming quality to Marshall's flick : it does not pretend to be what it isn't - as for example Refn's ""Valhalla Rising"" did."

","I thought this movie had a chance to be great, but it just seemed too rushed to salvage any potential it actually had. The character development was shallow, you'd see characters die early without having any attachment to them. There were attempts at emotional relationships, but the father/son, lovers, protagonist/antagonist relations never really deepened. If they had spent more time developing the story and characters, than try to do an LOTR-esque scenic overview of mountains, valleys, hills, it would have been great. I would say that the dialogue was not bad, the narration was a very nice touch. I really wish they had spent more time on this movie..."
"doctorsmoothlove","4","2","7","31 December 2010"," Centurdion
","The opening of Centurion is a panning long shot of a Scottish mountain landscape. It's a similar shot to Neil Marshall's earlier film Dog Soldiers, but apparently this picture was filmed in the UK. His earlier film was shot almost entirely in Luxembourg, and that means it isn't authentic. This technique is not unique to Marshall, as he's borrowing it from Mondo films. And like them, he attempts to sensationalize violence by follow a group of characters through a hazardous but believable situation. Mondo films are not as realistic as they think themselves, which Marshall tries to correct this time by placing his preferred violence within a historical context. This pet project is set during the Roman invasion of Britain, which really happened a long time ago. Such a discrete temporal placement is rendered unnecessary once we hear our Ninth Legion heroes make overt references to the Iraqi War and speak modern profanity. Dog Soldiers occurs in Scotland because Marshall wanted it to, and frankly, no one cared where it happened. A movie like this should be violent and probably misogynistic, and it works only if we aren't making fun of it.<br/><br/>The most puzzling thing about the whole movie is Marshall's decision to have us follow the Romans. The movie is light on dialog and heavy on action, so the only way we have to identify with the characters is by their classification. We should hardly be expected to sympathize with the invading forces, even though they are vulnerable. And if that wasn't a misfire enough, the Iraq illusions are presented by the Romans troops, only further alienating them from us. <br/><br/>The narrative follows a video game-like structure. After we meet the two parties, there is a conflict. We get a few moments of dullness and another encounter begins. The only lull happens when the roman commander, the last of his legion, finds a Pict outcast in the woods. Being as she is the only female with a speaking part until that point, he has to fall in love with her. The other female presence, a mute Pict warrior, is played by Olga Kurylenko. I have reason to believe she is a shrewd actress, but I have yet to see her be anything other a sex object in the last Bond film, Paris je t'aime, Max Payne and now this. She gets characterized like Lara Croft here; a silent sexy killing machine. She's still young enough to pull this off for a few more years, but I would really like to see her in a less exploitative role in a mainstream film.<br/><br/>Centurion is a toss-up for (male) viewers. If you would like your violence within a loose historical context, it satisfies as a rental. Still, Dog Soldiers is more streamlined movie unburdened with such a temporal constraint, and is scary. It also has numerous film references which this one lacks. The Descent is his best work, being the most focused and well-written. His most recent movie is a gutted version of one of his earlier works without the slightest trace of what made his earlier works enjoyable. Seriously, go rent Doomsday if you skipped it instead of this one.<br/><br/>Not Recommended"
"moselekm","8","2","7","5 September 2010"," Just Enough of Everything
","Let's get one thing straight with me. I hate action films that revolve around betrayal and/or romance. And because people seem to be horrible at even watching a film, I was completely scared of both of these when watching this film. Without giving anything away, there is everything in this movie and just the right amount of it.<br/><br/>UK Films that go back to 1400 AD and lower are always a treat. They give us their hallmark actors and actresses and we get to see them play, generally the same sort of role they did in their previous films. A nice little change is the Charismatic General, Dominic West, still plays his usual egocentric role, but instead of being the antagonist, he plays quite a lovable hero. His second up, Michael Fassbender who plays a determined and soulful leader, does a grand job to pick up on the other end of the scale. The supporting cast that we meet along the way are perfect for their roles and no one misses a beat.<br/><br/>This movie does have a storyline that does follow pretty accurate to Rome's history. Around the time of Emperor Commodus, best known for being in the movie Gladiator. However for history buffs, we know it was Commodus who began pushing for the island of Brittany. He was also the first 'duke'/'lord' of it as well. But no Emperor is mentioned, just a fun fact. Along with the accurate story-telling the movie does like to center itself around the fence of gore. Visceral Gore. Whoever began perfecting the use of CG-Gore, my hats off to them. Although it's pretty obvious when it's used, it allows for some crazy hack-n-slash effects. Such as cutting someone in half, cutting someone's arm off, cutting off half of someone's head. These sorts of things that make guys fist pump and lesser men cringe. But the gore is not out of bad taste.<br/><br/><ul><li>Like all British films that have such gore, it some how comes across as tasteful. I don't know if it's realistic, since I've never seen someone get axed in half, but they definitely shot for the grittiness of hand to hand combat. On that same note, many people I can imagine hated the director-of-photography. Many of the action scenes that involve many mêlées are broken up into almost an animate slide show of people putting the finishing blow on their opponent. Some of us may love it, while others enjoy more of the dramatic fights where swords cling more often than blood is spilled. But I'd like to think some of us are educated and know that is not how it worked back then.</li></ul><br/><br/>I am going to begin speaking about the ending now. No spoilers, but if you read too far into it you may begin creating your own ending and I'd hate for you to go into this movie thinking you know the ending. -A lot of people didn't like the ending. They felt it was perhaps weak? I don't see it as weak. I see it as probably the best possible ending. I got exactly what I wanted to be honest. I think people go to movies and still expect faeries and unicorns to make everything be alright. But the facts are facts and this movie obeyed them as best as theatrically possible. +End Ending discussion~!<br/><br/>So in conclusion. The movie is amazing. I have to say it's one of the better historical-fiction films I have seen. I think I may like it better than 300; in terms of Greco-Roman history. The movie combines action with just enough character-interaction and drama to keep you interested. Don't expect any twist endings or even any tear jerkers. It's just a good film to watch alone or with some friends. It may even get you interested enough to begin researching the 'rust and iron' age of the Roman Empire."
"gradyharp","8","2","7","30 August 2010"," Futility of Invasion: A Lesson Yet Unlearned
","CENTURION may not be a great movie - very entertaining, but not great - but it does make some points that are worth considering today. The concept of a big power (here the Roman Empire AD 117) making a preemptive war on a smaller, 'different' culture (the Picts of Scotland) cannot help but muster comparison to current US preemptive (and unsuccessful) attacks in the Middle East. Though it is doubtful that the writer director Neil Marshall's cinematic vision included this idea, the historic decimation of the Roman Ninth Legion's failure to conquer the Picts is poignant food for thought. <br/><br/>But on to the story. In 117 AD one of the few areas not controlled by the Roman Empire was the northern portion of the British Isles, land of the Picts, a strange tribal like people with determined, terrifyingly ferocious fighting techniques. General Titus Flavius Virilus (Domenic West) is given orders from the Roman Emperor to capture that stronghold, and he is off with the Ninth Legion to conquer. A born leader and beloved by his troops, Virilus fights valiantly but is captured and there is only one man deemed his replacement - former gladiator Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbinder, a major actor remembered for this disparate roles as in 'Hunger', 'Inglourious Basterds', '300', 'Band of Brothers' etc). Centurion is finally left with a handful of men (JJ Field, Lee Ross, David Morrisey, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Dimitri Leonidas, Riz Ahmed) who attempt to complete the mission. One mute female warrior Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict turned Roman Guide, quickly turns her allegiance to her homeland and becomes the most treacherous fighter of them all. At one point the son of Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen), the leader of the Picts, is killed by a Roman and the ferocity of the battle is heightened. The Roman troops endure untold hardships, are given hospitality by a Pict castaway Arianne (Imogen Poots) with whom Centurion becomes enamored, and eventually only Centurion remains as the sole survivor of the Roman Ninth Legion. The effect of his experience and knowledge of the war failure causes the Roman Empire to decide a fate for him and the rest is best left unsaid. <br/><br/>There is little dialogue, but what there is is solid. The battle scenes are appropriately gory and the cinematography by Sam McCurdy and the musical score by Ilan Eshkeri sustain the atmosphere. Michael Fassbinder proves that he is indeed a major talent, and the entire cast is excellent. It is a great little film for diversion, it could easily have been extended (only 98 minutes) for better fleshing out of the characters, but the final words of the Centurion suggest that there likely will be sequels. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

Had this been done with the big budgets of Hollywood and its big names it would have got a perfect 10. Not that Fassbender, West, and Cunnigham didn't do an excellent job already. <br/><br/>I've already watched it 3 times and i'm still looking forward to watching it a few more times.

There weren't any epic battles either, there is a scene where it was suppose to be over 3000 Romans in the Ninth Legion fighting the picts, but that was the only highlight of this film. After that the surviving Romans on the run from the picts. There are some good scenes here and there about loyalty and honor, but most of it is composed of boring chase scenes. I liked Olga Kurylenko playing Etain who is a tracker, but even that didn't make any sense sometimes. So she can track them from miles away but can't find them when they are right near her? It's disappointing to see a film that starts out with potential later go to waste. On the positive I thought the action sequences were well shot and you can actually tell what the hell is actually going on.<br/><br/>5.8/10"

It smelled like a trap from this side of the screen? What's in it for her? Sure, a few Pict lives to gain trust for the bigger game, but she was bringing the whole 9th Legion to them. Suddenly, after the big battle, six Romans get it and become commandos?

He is captured and taken to the Pict leader Gorlacon. General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) in York is ordered to destroy the Picts with his men.

"The-Sarkologist","7","1","3","12 November 2011"," A violent adventure north of Hadrian's Wall.
","A movie set in Scotland on the eve of the decline of the Roman Empire, this is a very violent and bloodthirsty historical drama. The film centres around the centurion Quintas Dias whose camp is attacked by the Picts and is captured and tortured in an attempt to learn of the Roman's plans for the area. He then escapes and is rescued by the reinforcements heading out to put an end to the Pict's revolt. However when the Romans and the Picts meet, the Romans are defeated and Dias is left with the remnants and ordered by his commanding officer to return. Thus the movie enters its main phase where the remnants of the legion are traveling through hostile territory while being pursued by the Picts and it is a race to get behind friendly lines before they are killed.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this is a very violent film, and the scenes of arms being hacked off, and heads being removed can be gut wrenching, but then that is what warfare was like in those days. Gunshot wounds in Hollywood almost seem quite tame when compare to this. Okay, Machete was pretty gruesome, but that is what I expect from a director like Robert Rodriguez, but after watching the first 10 minutes of this film, it made me wonder if this is the direction that Hollywood is heading.<br/><br/>Granted, I did enjoy this movie, though it is not one that I would rush out a purchase, though the violence does make me think about the attitudes of the Christians in Ancient Rome, who refused to go a watch the blood sports in the arenas. Granted, Roman Bloodsports were real and the crowds would cheer on gladiators who ruthlessly slew their opponents, while we watch our Hollywood movies with a sense in knowing that the scenes we watch are fake. However there a some people that I know that simply cannot handle watching violence, even on television.<br/><br/>The other thing is that most of the movies that I have seen about Rome (though not all) deal with Rome in Britain (or in Rome) though there is much more to the Roman Empire than Britain (or Rome, or even the Holy Land). However, that statement is probably a bit broad since there have been tele-movies about Hannibal, and a series about the political machinations during the civil war. But this movie could have easily been set in the deserts of Iraq as well as the mountains of Scotland. I guess it has something to do with our heritage coming from Britain, and that filming in Iraq is not the safest, or easiest, place to do so."

","Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts."

One thing that was annoying is the overuse of CGI blood effects which made the sword fighting action look a bit corny with blood spurts being too cartoon like and happening too often to take seriously.<br/><br/>The best aspect is the agreeable acting of the small group of men who must band together to try and overcome steep odds in their quest. Competent acting performances by the character actors give the movie some unexpected dramatic heft and substance. The ending of the movie ends up being a stereotypical disappointment, but on the whole a diverting enough experience to get there."

","This is another take on the legend of the Ninth Legion of Rome. They disappeared in mysterious circumstances when fighting the Picts (Scots) during the time of the Roman occupation of Britain. It's quite an exciting tale with a lot of blood, guts and gore along the way. Although it's far from perfect, I quite liked it for its fast pace and some excellent fight scenes.<br/><br/>The Ninth Legion, lead by General Titus Flavius Virilus are sent north to wipe out the troublesome Picts lead by the fearsome Gorlacon. Amongst their number is Centurion Quintus Dias, who has been posted to the region and knows the type of enemies they will face. They also have a Pict tracker in the shape of the mute Etain, she possesses great skill when it comes to finding the enemy. The Legion is ambushed and almost all are slaughtered, but a handful remain alive and try at first to rescue their captured General and then try to get back south to safety. With the Picts hot on their trail and the elements and terrain against then, can they survive long enough to make it home.<br/><br/>This film obviously didn't have a huge budget, but considering the limited resourced they had, I think it wasn't a bad effort. A decent cast was lead by Michael Fassbender as Centurion Quintus Dias, with Dominic West as General Titus Flavius Virilus, David Morrissey as Bothos, Ulrich Thomsen as Gorlacon, Olga Kurylenko as Etain, Liam Cunningham as Brick and Imogen Poots (great name!) as Arianne. All did a good job in, what must have been very trying circumstances.<br/><br/>The plot is quite fast and exciting with some great fight sequences and a few edge-of-your-seat moments. All this was very good and I was enjoying the chase with a nice little dose of betrayal and intrigue thrown in. Unfortunately about two thirds of the way through all the momentum is lost when the surviving few stop to lick their wounds at the house of an outcast. Although an attempt is made to regain some of the lost inertia, it fails to reach the same level. While I thought this section could have bee shorter to help the pacing, I still thought it was a pretty good film. It has a 15 certificate here in the UK which surprised me a little given the level of violence depicted. But over all, a decent enough film (with a few reservations) Recommended (just).<br/><br/>My Score: 7.1/10"

","I like a good ""historical"" film and I'm not picky about whether it's historically accurate or not. (It never is, it's about entertainment and storytelling. Get over it.) So I like Centurion even though it has faults and is bloated and overlong but this impressed me so much more especially bearing in mind Ridley Scott's budget was at least a hundred times more than the one for Centurion. In fact Scott has got really flabby with his work recently - I hated Robin Hood with a vengeance. My suspicion is that Marshall is driven to produce more for less because of budgetary constraints.<br/><br/>I did have difficulty sympathising with the Romans in this film because every instinct I have is fully behind the Picts. Yes we make a joke about ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"" but in my case I really hate the Romans. I guess it's part of my racial heritage. Nevertheless the actors do a really good job of appearing to be decent guys and they do win you over, sort of.<br/><br/>Cinematography and the score are both excellent too and deserve a mention. This isn't your typical big budget action film made for a zillion bucks in Hollywood. It was made relatively cheaply in the UK and it's all the better for it.

","This came out at around about the same time as Kevin MacDonald's ""The Eagle"", based on the same historic incident, the disappearance of Rome's 9th Legion in what is now Scotland. Nothing is known of the circumstances of their demise, so Director Neil Marshall has free rein to interpret the event. Yet the plot elements bear some similarities with MacDonald's interpretation. Marshall is best known for his horror films ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent"", so unsurprisingly the rawness and gore of ancient living and battle is of particular interest to him. No battle scene is complete without graphic gouging, decapitation and limb severance.<br/><br/>The Scottish countryside provides a magnificent visual backcloth to the film and the opening Pict assault on the Roman outpost is visceral and sets the standard for the subsequent battle scenes. The sole survivor, Quintus Dias(Michael Fassbender) then joins the 9th Legion to put down the Pict Rebellion only to suffer the Legion itself being all but wiped out in the stand-out scene of the film, a Pict ambush in a wooded valley. They are led into the ambush by a treacherous female Pict scout, Etain. However the dramatic impact of her role is limited by the fact that she is mute, having had her tongue ripped out by the Romans .<br/><br/>A handful of Romans survive the ambush and learn that their General has been captured by the Picts which provides the pretext for an attack on the Pict camp. But they fail to free the general, murdering the Pict leaders son in the process which unsurprisingly has the Picts hunting them down with Etain in the lead. Two elements hinder this film, as they did ""The Eagle"". The Pictish language is sub-titled which restricts how much you can include for character development (which is negligible on the Pict side) and secondly an open landscape with overwhelming odds in favour of the Picts restrict dramatic tension considerably.<br/><br/>The film is almost entirely plot driven, with very little characterisation. This is a shame because when it does draw breath, when Dias and his men find shelter and support from a Witch, the story takes on a welcome extra dimension and it provides a satisfying coda to the plot. Overall, ""Centurion"" was not that well received by the critics. Apart from the ambush scene, it lacks the grand epic quality of ""Gladiator"" and the story is scarcely enough for 97 minutes. Michael Mann's interpretation of ""Last of the Mohicans"" set a modern day standard of ""heroes on the run in the wilderness"" which all subsequent pretenders find hard to beat. But what it does do, it does well, bloody combat scenes. And these are sufficiently well done, and frequent enough to make it enjoyable enough .<br/><br/>The head to head comparisons with ""The Eagle"" are interesting. ""The Eagle's"" opening scene and fort assault are better, and the use of a local slave as a guide whose loyalties are in doubt far better handled as a story. But once it gets going ""Centurion"" is far stronger as the legion marches north, and the set piece battle wins hands down. ""The Eagle"" is stronger in the Pictsish camp, but the ""Centurion"" wins in the final pursuit with a more satisfying ending.<br/><br/>Because so little is known about British history other than from Roman sources historical accuracy is not an important factor, but a plot problem is. The Romans are the invaders and when the heroes are the ruthless aggressors an audiences sympathy, especially in the united Kingdom, will be at best divided. Combine this with sketchy character development and you have a story which should be enough to satisfy the ""blood and splat"" enthusiasts, but disappoint those hoping for a little more."

","At first when you see the gore, the blood and hacked off limbs, you think this is going to be another rip off of Ridly Scott's ""Gladiator"". Then you see the blue paint on the warrior's skin and their axe wielding ways, and it's a rip off of ""Braveheart"". Well it's not. Centurion is about the legendary 9th legion, marched under orders, into the heart of the Picts and was never heard of again. 6 soldiers survive only to be hunted down by a vengeful Etain and her warriors. <br/><br/>I have enjoyed this movie because firstly the one big thing I noticed was the cinematography and the use of the wide lens to capture the wilderness of the Scotish highland. Sam McCurdy vision is sublime. Not a soul to be seen for miles, the scenery looked beautiful yet at the same time dangerous as you can see the actual cold shivers of the actors and the breath coming from their mouths. (That's were most of my 6 of my star votes going to).<br/><br/>Secondly, costume and set design, looked all authentic, even down to the shoes. I found the Picts garment to be well suited to the climate, while the Roman's wore a much more sturdier clothing. Not overly powering elaborately designed as in Gladiator, but that's the difference between a Hollywood budget and the British Film industry. The props were cleverly done as was the set for Roman garrison and the village of the Picts. <br/><br/>Thirdly, the actors: Olga Kurylenko as Etain was a much more realistic character then the skinny, barely covered Kiera Knightly in 'King Arthur"" (2004). She's tough, resilient and vengeful, not one part of her is soft, vulnerable and feminine. Being mute made the actor rely on other methods to convey her feelings; she stand her own ground when it comes to fighting with the men. Centurion Quintus Dias played by Michael Fassbender,certainly looks the part of a Roman soldier. Strong, dependable, loyal and sturdy. His acting was very good and I can only put it down to the harsh conditions the actors were in on location shooting. The supporting cast are good, wonderful to see Liam Cunningham as the veteran fighter, full of wisdom. The man is a GOD!!!<br/><br/>Lastly, although this production is flawed (i.e. actors riding saddles) and too much blood and gore, this is overall a very entertaining film. This is not an Hollywood epic nor a history lesson, it has a simple plot and action...don't take it too seriously.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I disliked about the film is the ending; not one of it's strong points. It was cheesy, clique and pointless...I won't put a spoiler comment, only you have to see it yourself."

","When you're picking your battles, never pick to fight the Picts! I watched Centurion last night. It's Neil Marshall's take on the mystery of the Roman 9th Legion, which mysteriously disappeared in Scotland sometime around 117 A.D. Wow.!<br/><br/>I'm not sure how historically accurate any of it is, but the movie is a great time. It's bloody and action packed and never really slows down until literally the very last minute. The acting was better than usual in action movies. Dominic West as The Roman General Titus Flavius Virilus was fantastic, he was just the kind of commander you'd want to serve under and I felt he out-Spartan'ed Gerard Jones from 300. Michael Fassbender was good as the thoughtful Centurion Quintus Dias and Imogene Poot did a nice job as the ""witch"" Arianne. She put a nice spin on the character, making her more of an outcast than a menace. The scenery is also amazing. I never knew Scotland was so beautiful or even that it has mountains.<br/><br/>But the breakaway star of this movie, hands down, was Olga Kurylenko as Etain, the Pictish scout who hunts Romans. She is quite the Terminator in this movie; she is so overwhelmingly powerful that she almost seems like a force of nature. But her performance isn't all one note. Etain has a good reason to feel and act the way she does. She and her family were horribly brutalized by the Romans and now, as one character put it, ""she has an empty whole in her soul that only Roman blood can fill."" She does have a final showdown with Fassbender's character, Quintus Dias, and although I don't want to give anything away BUT when Quintus eventually kills her she seems both furious at being killed and relieved that she no longer has to feel the pain of her loss. Maybe I'm getting a little hokey there, but I think she gave a great performance, especially with a character who is mute and can only convey her feelings through her eyes and body language."

","CENTURION is very different war movie. There are not really good guys; in fact everybody is really cruel; so even if told through the Roman's eyes, it is clearly stated that they are as barbaric as their enemies (the Britain PICTOS). It is a British movie about how the British barbarians defeated the more sophisticated (and powerful) Roman Empire. Directed by Neil Marshall (the genius behind Dog Soldiers, The Descent and DOOMSDAY) do not expect standard fare action movie (even when action and gore are usually over the top). Acting is good and character development is exactly what is needed (there are usually some dark sides left to viewers imagination).<br/><br/>In brief; good action and gore but a very very good movie."

"lost-in-limbo","7","1","4","22 November 2014"," ""I don't know about you, but I'm tired of running"".
","Film-maker Neil Marshall kicked off his career with two outstanding low- budget horror films; ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent"". Quite a promising start. Then followed ""Doomsday"", which got a mixed response. I enjoyed it, but it's nothing more than an outrageous homage to post-apocalyptic films like ""Escape to New York"" and the ""Mad Max"" series. So his fourth outing would see Marshall tackle a swords and sandals revenge pursuit on the frontier of the Roman Empire in ""Centurion"". It's a gritty and brutal tale of survival and courage, where Rome's invasion of northern Britain hit's a bump when they encounter the guerrilla tactics of the tribal enemy the Picts. There's something about it that looks epic thanks to its crisp, sweeping photography, but its minimalist story telling makes sure it doesn't quite complement it. The narrative is a fast-paced, cross-country chase of rugged action and bloody onslaughts amongst beautiful highland scenery. Where the terrain is just as harsh and unforgiving, as the Roman's enemy. I think it loses shape and momentum after the hour mark and the heavy-handed script gives us the usual character arches, but Marshall's stylish verve is slick and taut. The battle scenes are executed in a spectacular manner, where it's a barrage of relentless and gusty combat. Michael Fassbender leads the way as a man looking for redemption and Olga Kurylenko makes an impression as a Pict warrior. Also Dominic West pops up. Simple, but effective action romp that for most part doesn't let up and is masterfully framed.<br/><br/>""This is a new kind of war""."
"brchthethird","7","1","4","14 November 2014"," A potent combination of historical speculation and gonzo violence
","While there isn't too much depth to the plot or characters, CENTURION is a passable period action film about what might have happened to Rome's 9th Legion. The cast is led by Michael Fassbender as the titular centurion, Quintas Dias, and has Dominic West as a Roman general and Bond girl Olga Kurylenko as a mute Pict warrior. Overall, the performances are decent but nothing truly amazing. Some of the highlights of the film were creative opening titles, some beautiful, blue-tinged cinematography and a rousing score. However, the biggest draw are the action sequences and Neil Marshal really delivered in the blood-and-guts department. Limbs are hacked off, people are stabbed and shot with arrows, and blood flowed freely. The only downside to this aspect of the film was the way in which they were shot, i.e., similar to GLADIATOR and other movies like that. If one were to compare this movie to another one, I would pick KING ARTHUR because of the time period and subject matter. Even the plots are similar. But despite the similarities, I would think CENTURION edges out KING ARTHUR by a little bit because it isn't aspiring to be some epic origin story. This movie is fairly basic and knows it. There's even a half-baked romantic subplot, which isn't even introduced until the movie is half over. So, if you're looking for a decent action movie that won't tax your brain too much, this one should do just fine."

","After reading all the negative reviews, I wasn't expecting much from Centurion, when putting into the Blu Ray player at the weekend. I have to say, I was really pleasantly surprised. Based on the mystery of the disappearance of the 9th Legion who were said to have vanished without trace, during their invasion of Scotland in 108 AD, Centurion was an interesting and captivating watch. The film explores this legend and offers an explanation as to what could have happened . The storyline was good, the script strong and the performances were great. Not to mention the beautiful landscapes used in filming. The costume and sets appeared authentic too, but I am no expert by any means. If you go into this film with no expectations or judgements, and take the film for what it is, I think you can't help but enjoy it."

I love Michael Fassbender, and think that he fit his lead role just fine. His character isn't particularly vivid or interesting, but it does the job that it is meant to as the main character.<br/><br/>The general is honestly the best character in the film, and it is a disappointment that you don't see more than you do. His character is Lovable and enjoyable. So all in all not to bad acting.<br/><br/>The movie is very violent and not for the queasy, but the action is very well executed, and doesn't seem unnecessary, it seems to perfectly get the pint across that the Picts are a brutal merciless group of people.

","Before watching this movie, I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews. With low expectations, I decided to watch it anyway. Eventually, I wasn't disappointed. The storyline and the dialogues sometimes are a bit cliché (2 female warriors (?), a small romance stuffed into it). The plot is simple, as its merely chasing and running. However, the scenery is beautifully shot. The battles are well done, quite realistic. The actors are alright. The director isn't afraid to let most of the key characters die, which makes it more realistic. The movie is quite short, but it shouldn't have been any longer. Overall, this movie is worth the watch. But, as the majority of the reviews already pointed out, don't expect to be swept off your feet."

It's also about politics and pure survival, but most of all this film is about comradeship. I am a bit of a cynic but I must say I really enjoyed this movie and once it would have won many awards, but the powers that be think it can be ignored. Despite this it is a film that holds true and should be watched and talked about and celebrated.

"chucknorrisrules","8","1","4","18 September 2012"," A flawed yet underrated gem
","Since I am such a lover of history, centurion was a must for me, especially since it was a Neil Marshall movie - one of my favourite directors. When I first watched Gladiator, I hoped for some sort of similar epic centred around the Eagle of the Ninth storyline, but it seems like this film has been the answer to my prayers.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the legend of the ninth legion. A roman legion marches north of England into what was ancient Scotland (back then called pictland), and they disappeared. A book called Eagle of the Ninth was written about it in the 1950s involving a son of a legionnaire going north to recover the eagle. There was a film made of it in 2011 called 'The Eagle' though I haven't seen it quite yet.<br/><br/>This film shows the attack on the legion after advancing into pictland where a handful of men survive and are now trying to escape a hunting group of picts led by the mute Etain (Olga Kurylenko) whose entire existence since her brutalisation and her parents' slaughter at the hands of the Romans, is devoted to taking the lives of Roman soldiers.<br/><br/>The cast is top-notch. Michael Fassbender is excellent as the lead role and he puts his all into it. The rest of the cast of survivors are excellent as well, but apart from Riz Ahmed's Arabic cook and Noel Clarke's Greek runner, all seem to be too similar to each other. The picts are excellent as well, but easier to distinguish, especially Dave Legeno and Axelle Carolyn. Olga Kurylenko seems at first a bit too skinny looking to be a really strong Pict warrior, but her mute character and her brutal nature soon overcomes this. She is a really powerful presence on screen, but as well as being intimidating, she also comes across as quite a tragic figure, and her skinny frame also portrays a sense of frailty to her character that comes across very well. She clearly leads an almost heartbreakingly sad existence living only for vengeance.<br/><br/>There are a couple of flaws in this film. The Romans carry spears rather than pilums (though that can apparently be explained away by compromise), the weird romantic subplot that appears during the course of the plot seems strangely tacked on and out of place. Also, what struck me as strangest was that after Etain's brutalisation she headed north to Gorlacon's tribe, presumably at such a young age and in the state she'd have been in she'd not have been able to travel too far so she probably came from the northeast of Albion, but how was she able to tell them such a detailed story of her brutality if she was mute? Having said all that, the camera work is excellent. Though the Romans are invaders and one would naturally side with the picts, their own brutality comes through and you really sympathise with the tired, cold, hungry and scared survivors as this unstoppable Pict warrior and her followers, and the extent that even the landscape is a threat to them.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Centurion yet, see it, but recognise that it is not a perfect movie, though a damned fine one at that"
"Wuchakk","7","1","4","29 August 2012"," Solid sword & sandal flick with hints of greatness
","""Centurion"" takes place circa 117-122 AD in Great Britain and speculates the fate of the Roman 9th Legion, which disappeared at the time and remains a mystery to this day.<br/><br/>PLOT: Seven legion survivors of a surprise Pictish attack go into enemy territory to retrieve their general (Dominic West). The legionnaires then go deeper into the wilderness to escape the vengeance of the Picts with the intention of looping back around. Unfortunately for them, the Picts have an expert tracker on hand; a mute woman with whom the Romans are quite familiar.<br/><br/>ANALYSIS: Michael Fassbender is outstanding as the leader of the remaining legionnaires, Quintus Dias, while Olga Kurylenko is effective as the vengeful Pict tracker, Etain, and Imogen Poots shines as an outcast in the wilderness, Arianne.<br/><br/>The scenery of the film is breathtaking, shot on location in England and Scotland, whilst the pace is brisk at a mere 97 minutes. The latter reveals the weakness of the film as this is definitely a tale that would've worked better at 2 hours minimum. Although there are some quality character-defining sequences and near-epic moments, the film needed more. As it is, it's kind of a blur, but still very worthwhile. The score's quite good as well.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: ""Centurion"" is reminiscent of 2004's ""King Arthur,"" as far as story, location and overall tone go. The main difference is that the events in ""King Arthur"" take place 350 years later and involve the legendary Arthur as a Roman warrior. ""Centurion,"" by contrast, occurs when Hadrian's Wall was just starting to materialize. Both films are worthwhile to sword & sandal devotees, but ""King Arthur"" ultimately plays better due to its longer runtime and therefore more characterization and epic-ness.<br/><br/>Be sure to catch 2011's ""The Eagle,"" which is essentially the (unofficial) sequel to ""Centurion"" where the son of the general of the 9th legion ventures into the Pictish wilderness with a Briton slave to regain the 9th legion's gold eagle standard. ""The Eagle"" is less Hollywoodized, has a much better first act and is all-around more realistic, but ""Centurion"" is more conventionally entertaining, has important female characters and a superior last act.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ <br/><br/>*** SPOILERS FOLLOW*** <br/><br/>One reviewer complained that the film fails to provide conventional protagonists: How can you root for the Romans when they're the invading army who were responsible for raping Etain when she was a girl, killing her parents, and cutting out her tongue? In addition, at least one legionnaire is revealed to be a total scumbag. But then it's hard to root for the Picts since Etain is so bitter and vengeful, plus the Picts are pretty much portrayed as the antagonists to the remaining members of the 9th legion.<br/><br/>I would argue that the film encourages us to disregard political loyalties (Roman, Pict or otherwise) and root for the persons worthy of rooting for. In this case, Quintus Dias and Arianne (the ""witch""). Why? Because they both prove to have hearts of gold, which is one of the reasons they're so drawn to each other, beyond the physical attraction.<br/><br/>As for the film's message, it's driven home at the end: Big government is not worthy of your absolute loyalty and service because they'll throw you to the wolves in a second if it serves their purposes. (Government in general is good and necessary but big government is intrinsically untrustworthy and harmful, i.e. evil)."

He proved that he can carry my interest with his ability to draw me into his character and make me care about his situation. Dominic West plays a supporting role but is the only other recognizable name in the film (at least to me). He is a good actor, very talented and adept at playing bad guys (see ""300"" and ""John Carter""), although his role here is defined by what side of the fence you happen to be on. Olga Kurylenko's role doesn't call for much range, just that she show up and exhibit rage expressed in lethal ability....and she delivers.<br/><br/>Quintas Dias (Fassbender) is the Roman sole survivor of a Pict attack on his outpost. After escaping his captors, he is rescued from certain death by the Ninth Legion under the command of General Titus Flavius Virilus (West). The Ninth Legion has been dispatched to march north and end the Pict threat conclusively.<br/><br/>Etain (Kurylenko) has been assigned to accompany the Ninth Legion as their guide and scout through the harsh northern lands of the Picts...but her past is never very far away from her, nor are the consequences of those experiences. <br/><br/>After the Ninth Legion is ambushed and General Virilus captured, Quintas Dias and a small band of six survivors set out to rescue him and return to Roman territory. What follows is a harrowing adventure in survival, betrayal...and surprisingly, love.<br/><br/>I watched this movie on a road trip and didn't know anything about it as it began, and wasn't very excited about watching it until I saw Fassbender's name pop up. I was just about ready to go to sleep instead, but decided to give it my attention...and it was a decision that I'm very glad I made.<br/><br/>The cinematography was well done and the directing kept me enthralled from one scene to the next as the movie flows seamlessly. I was pleasantly surprised at how exciting the combat scenes were and a little shocked at how gory some of the shots were, but it added to the intensity and the realism of the film.<br/><br/>I've read that the movie is more based on myth than actual historical events, and I didn't scrutinize it for historical flaws or hinge the value of it by it's historical accuracy. I watched out of interest with a slight hope of being entertained...and what I got in return was more entertainment than I knew what to do with.

","This film has been sitting on my shelf for over a year now unwatched. Yesterday, I finally sat down and watched 'Centurion' with no great expectations, I was just wanting to watch a film.<br/><br/>The film is very good, the story works well without romanticising the Romans too much and portrays the Picts very well also. <br/><br/>The acting in this film was great for the most part, especially by Dominic West who had too small a role, his humorous character provides a lot of comic relief from gory battle scenes and he was probably my favourite character. Michael Fassbender's role was amicable, he succeeded in certain aspects of his character such as the warrior in him but failed at portraying himself as a leader. As a fan of Michael's work. his acting was very good in this but not as great as he has been in other films. However, some actors like Noel Clarke (who was simply playing Noel Clarke) let the film down in certain scenes. Even Olga Kurylenko was good despite her character not saying one word throughout the entire film! Imogen Poots' brief appearance is also welcomed with a very realistic Scottish accent - as a Scottish person myself, there's nothing more fun than laughing at an actor's poor attempts at the accent but Imogen did her's very well and there was nothing to laugh at! <br/><br/>The script can be quite predictable at some points which isn't necessarily a bad thing but you would like a little surprise here and there that isn't through the use of over the top gore. The gore in this film is the main problem I have. I certainly don't mind gore in films but it should be used when needed, not added in to places in fight scenes where, realistically, there would not be such a splash of blood!<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film if you are just wanting a good old-fashioned war film, but don't expect Gladiator because there are very few points in this film where you are moved emotionally. The film tries its best to be Gladiator-like (with dramatic music, slow motion fight scenes and tiny incidents of tragedy) but I think if it focused more on the film itself it would have been better."

","Now Centurion, or should I call it The Descent 2? But there is already a sequel to that film I hear you say - and I acknowledge that. But while The Descent 2 was so faithful it was almost a remake, Centurion too is eerily similar in many respects.<br/><br/>OK so this is set in ancient Rome and not a cave = different, but let's keep going; The Descent – 6 people are isolated by circumstances and beset by enemies.<br/><br/>Centurion – 7 people are isolated by circumstances and beset by enemies.<br/><br/>The Descent – While on the run one of the party suffers a graphic broken leg.<br/><br/>Centurion – Ditto.<br/><br/>The Descent – The leaders of the attackers are vicious and unintelligible.<br/><br/>Centurion – Ditto.<br/><br/>The Descent – To escape one of the survivors willingly and perhaps unnecessarily sacrifices another.<br/><br/>Centurion – Ditto.<br/><br/>OK one similarity = fair enough, 2? = pushing it But 4 key plot details practically the same and it reeks either of a lack of inspiration or laziness.<br/><br/>Centurion follows a small band of Roman soldiers isolated from the main army and caught deep in enemy territory. It is very violent but obviously CGI assisted – this is starting to reduce the visceral impact for me when pinkish blood spurts out in blatantly computerised fashion – and features a couple of good original scenes, but there is just too many similarities that remind you of a former – and much, much better – movie.<br/><br/>Even if you are ripping yourself off it still is a little dishonest. The use of supposed rebel hottie fighters is excusable except for the fact that they really only get into one stoush, hard to justify just how awesome they are if they take on an enemy in lesser numbers.<br/><br/>There are some sweeping vistas and exciting camera-work that reminded me a lot of the Lord of the Rings in terms of scenery, but the comparisons ended there.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a movie about a small group attempting to elude vicious assailants rent The Descent, better yet buy it.<br/><br/>If you want to watch the same thing only nowhere near as good you might check this out. Just let it be known that if Neil Marshall lived in the US he might be named Zack Snyder, whether you think that is a good thing or not is up to you.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5.5 / 10.

","For me the blood and gore over shadows the rest of the film. I simply had a hard time watching this thing with all the squib work and excessive gore and blood splatters.<br/><br/>Well shot, there was some cliché acting and story telling involved. The story itself seems to be recycled material from King Arthur with lots of blood, which to me says that the target demographic was probably misread to cater to a more bloodthirsty audience, which probably wasn't all that blood thirsty in the first place, but perhaps more interested in seeing ""realistic action"". Blood gushing from bodies is not realistic.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that for all the high production values that went into this film the realism gets tossed out the window, and is replaced with pornographic blood letting. Regrettable, but there it is. It seems like five minutes don't go by without someone getting hacked up and spilling a gallon of blood. Is that real? No.<br/><br/>The acting is a bit melodramatic, but fits with pacing and overall film. Even so I'd be hard put to call it likable.<br/><br/>I guess the best way to sum up this film is that it will appeal to those who have a thirst for grotesque hack-and-slash violence, but not much more. There's nary a love story, little of the politics of the time, little true realism (even little grittiness, as everyone seems very clean, save when they fight), but the film does deliver on incredibly high production values. Watching the deleted scenes one wonders why the first scene in the collection wasn't added (in spite of the director's commentary), because the film needed a few contemplative moments.<br/><br/>If you want a true Roman sword and sandal epic, then look elsewhere, though if you're a die hard fan of the genre, then you may want to add this to your collection (which I may begrudgingly do... but more likely not).<br/><br/>Not really a film I would recommend.<br/><br/>Definitely watch at your own risk."

","Indeed not a bad movie! Good Storyline and Impressive Action scenes. It's entertaining. However, there is something seriously wrong with the movie, which becomes the fun-spoiler.<br/><br/>The movie about Hunting. It was supposed to bring thrill, but it indeed failed in that. The characters were not so freighting as they were supposed to be. I don't really understand why Etain was tried to be utilized for that purpose. I mean, I don't mind if she had to be the leading villain. But it would have been a lot better if she was utilized as an extra-ordinary scout, led by another leader who could be indeed strong and frightening. Especially when around 14 members (I don't have the real count though, but it seemed somewhat like that) of hunters team are chasing 7 trained warriors, it is expected from the beginning that sooner or later they are going to entangle in a direct fight. And it was in their favor, as they also knew that guerrilla tactics could be in their favor (hide and attack, even if they were not particularly trained for those), but they never really tried to do that (but only once, and not even with actually a plan as well). With such gruesome movie, a great opportunity was indeed lost to bring terror.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is good, and I'll recommend you to watch it. However, you will agree with the aspect that I've mentioned here. 5/10 for good story and action."
"edmund-marlowe","5","1","5","19 January 2015"," Gritty fantasy
","Watchable because it is well acted (especially by Dominic West), starkly beautiful in its cinematography and grittily realistic in its depiction of warfare, this account of the disappearance of the Romans' Ninth Legion in Caledonia is also shameful in its contempt for historical truth or realism. If you prefer fantasy to historically realistic fiction, fine, but there is no need to deceive the unwary into thinking it depicts something that could have happened. That is taking advantage of and reinforcing a popular ignorance and lack of imagination miserably dominant regarding anything that happened more than a few centuries ago.<br/><br/>The only historical character depicted is the Roman governor of Britain, Agricola, shown here in AD 117 as an old man anxious to escape his responsibilities in favour of Roman politics. This is turning the truth on its head as far as possible, for Agricola was governor forty years earlier and in the prime of his life. He is well remembered as having achieved far more than any other Roman governor and having been reluctantly recalled by a jealous emperor because of that. Straying into deeper matters, a Roman legion consisted of about five thousand soldiers, so it is incomprehensible that the commander of the Ninth would have advanced into enemy territory with the few dozen depicted, and in winter when no one campaigned because the invaded would have held all the advantages. But these criticisms suggest taking the film as potentially serious history. I'm afraid challenging it as the latter may be a lost cause as regards anyone so deluded by modern, feminist propaganda as to manage avoiding laughter or despair when presented with the fantasy of primitive ancient viragos even aspiring to slaughter in single combat the best trained soldiers of the age, (and before someone mentions Boudicca, I had better mention that though she rode in a chariot, no ancient source suggests she fought in the battles she presided over).<br/><br/>Both this and The Eagle, the other film about the lost Ninth Legion, seem more sympathetic to the Romans than the Picts, the telling fact here being that the Romans speak English while the Picts speak an invented language. I found that interesting just because it was not what I would have expected from 21st century sentiment.<br/><br/>Edmund Marlowe, author of Alexander's Choice, a love story, www.amazon.com/dp/1481222112"
"Quinoa1984","6","1","5","8 November 2014"," Marshall takes a stab at medieval fantasy
","Probably a ""better"" movie than Doomsday, though not as fun, and certainly nowhere near the high quality of The Descent, which may probably be the only masterpiece Neil Marshall's got. All the same, it's some bloody good action for the most part, and Olga Kurylenko by proxy of a character literally tongue-less doesn't have the kind of poor acting she had in Quantum of Solace. Also, Michael Fassbender is always made of win. As is lots of gore and violence, sans the CG blood.<br/><br/>All this said - after seeing Marshall direct the episode of Game of Thrones in season 2, where the battle happens at the Lannister castle... I forgive this film some of its problems as it served as a 'trial' run for Marshall's best direction yet. If nothing else, Centurion is an interesting film to see the seeds of what would come in mastering that kind of wild, heart-felt and action-packed style of direction."
"degeneraatti","5","1","5","11 October 2014"," A pack of decent action scenes doesn't yet make a movie
","Centurion is the fourth film by Neil Marshall, the director previously responsible for the films Dog Soldiers, The Descent, and Doomsday. So it can be expected that when it comes to action Mr. Marshall should deliver.<br/><br/>And deliver he does. The action parts are, if occasionally suffering a bit from slight excess and shaky camera, a pleasure for the viewer. The thought and dedication that went into making them is visible. It has to be noted though, that the amount of graphic violence on screen will definitely be too much for those who think that eg. Robocop or Sabotage are too violent.<br/><br/>That is, however, where the praises end. The acting present is good, yet nothing spectacular, and the delightful action scenes would benefit from more flesh in the story to makes the viewer more engaged. The Eagle, that in theory could be a sequel to Centurion, had that side covered better, even with the less-inspired direction and acting. Maybe combining these two would make a real gem of a movie?<br/><br/>All and all, this film is worth a watch for those with a bit of taste for action or historical movies, and maybe even a re-watch for those with more than just a bit of that aforementioned taste.

","It would be rather too easy to poke gentle fun at Centurion, and I'm afraid it's a temptation I shall find impossible to resist, but although I've read that it was made on a budget - £10 million is regarded as rather a small budget in the film-making world, I gather - that is not obvious, so it deserves a little respect.<br/><br/>Writer/director Neil Marshall has used his imagination well and I doubt whether an extra £90 million would have made much difference, if any at all. All in all it is more or less a piece of Boys' Own hokum about a bunch of Roman soldiers, the sole survivors of a massacre by the Picts of Rome's Ninth Legion, who have to make their way home through a very inhospitable Scotland, all the while tracked by a posse of vicious Picts led by a mute woman who has nothing on her mind at all but revenge (and who sports a startling amount of kohl on her eyelids throughout).<br/><br/>In sum, it's a chase film, and there's nothing much wrong with that if that's your bag. Unfortunately, it isn't mine unless there's a little more and here there isn't. Characterisation is minimal and there's no plot to speak off.<br/><br/>Aspects of the film which left me underwhelmed were just how fast and loose Marshall played with Scottish geography: one minute our intrepid gang of Romans are several thousand feet high crossing a snowy mountain, and barely ten minutes later they are trekking through the kind of dense woodland you will not find in the Highlands. I hate to disillusion non-Brits, but there's an awful lot of rather dull countryside in the middle of Scotland before you get to the Highlands (and for the record I rather like The Borders).<br/><br/>I am also always disconcerted in these films by how men who are living rougher than you and I will ever have the misfortune to live manage to remain more or less clean-shaven throughout. Yes, I know that has a lot to do with production schedules and that films are rarely shot in rigid sequence, but it does rather spoil an illusion. I was also rather puzzled as to where our gang of Romans managed to pick up their rather natty furs. But what the hell, Centurion is, after all, nothing more than hoary old hokum and in its favour is that it pretends to be nothing more. OK, much of the dialogue is quotably heroic and at times a little ponderous but, but who knows, perhaps the Romans were rather like that.<br/><br/>And here's a spoiler: the hero gets the girl. I shan't tell you how - for that you'll have to watch the film yourselves. But it is reassuring how some staples of film can never be ignored."

"davidfurlotte","6","1","5","12 February 2011"," Historical? I think not.
","I have seen a number of people on here writing reviews and REBUTTALS to people who have correctly stated some of the more inane historical inaccuracies evident in this movie. The most notable who rebutted was someone who mentioned the Battle of the Teutoberger Wald to explain the reality of the battle scene between the Picts and the Romans in a Scottish Forest.<br/><br/>Okay, let's begin with some of the more ridiculous aspects of this film. Firstly, the Ninth Legion, Legio IX Hispana did NOT disappear in some Scottish Forest in 117 A.D. Historical documents and Archaeological finds have proved that elements of this legion were stationed in Germania many years after they supposedly ""vanished."" Which means that they vanished because they left Britannia and moved to Germania.<br/><br/>What pains me about this film is the Director and writer claims to be the son of a History Professor yet for some strange reason he decided to take great care in outfitting the legionaries (yes, legionaries, legionnaires are French, not Roman) with Lorica Segmentata, Pteruges, Rectangular Scutums et al, but decided to have them carrying leaf bladed spears instead of the Pilum which Roman Heavy Infantry were renowned for.<br/><br/>Now, coming back to the Battle of the Teutoberger Wald for a moment, an entire roman legion, numbering anywhere between 4,800 to 5,500 men is ambushed and annihilated in less than a half hour? The ambush that Arminius launched against Varus in Germania resulted in battle over four long days to completely destroy those three legions and guess what, that 14 mile long single column NEVER existed. The Romans travelled along a PATH that allowed them to travel anywhere from 4 to 8 men WIDE at all times. There were many reasons those three legions were destroyed. Firstly, over the course of those four days they were fighting in thunderstorms constantly, secondly, Varus trusted Arminius so much and considered Germania to be a tame land that he did not send out scouts while on the march and finally, Arminius sent men along to LEAD Varus to a well-prepared area of AMBUSH. To the person that suggested someone might open some of the writings of Tacitus and other historians, I suggest strongly YOU might want to do likewise because I HAVE read them and also read them in the original Latin.<br/><br/>But, I digress.<br/><br/>It seems that the writers for ""Centurion"" missed the boat when it came to Roman Battle tactics. Firstly, if Romans were faced with something like rolling fireballs, they were more than skillfully trained to simply move OUT of the way, same as what they did in battles against Carthaginian elephants after Canae. They also might have used their scutums to form a wall and basically angle back so the thing rolled up and over them. Roman legionaries were drilled to be able to handle such tactics because such things are mentioned in the diaries of Julius Caesar.<br/><br/>Many of the defending Romans on the path were shown throwing away their shield in panic and trying to parry like some kind of regular swordsman against the Picts. Roman legionaries would never, ever, throw away a perfectly good shield so they could defend against an unshielded opponent, nor would they break formation in order to go at it like some gladiator in the arena. The strength of the Roman soldier was as a unit of fighting men, not singular combat and their centurion would be demanding they get back in formation as best they could. To see an example of this, watch ROME, Season 1, Episode 1 for a good example of how Romans fought.<br/><br/>However, with all of the historical inaccuracy in the movie, it was an entertaining tale and yes, the main protagonist did remind me way too much of Xena, the warrior princess, however, she, along with the blonde witch were simply used in the story to provide some enjoyable eye candy for the us of the masculine gender although both ladies portrayed their parts very well, I thought.<br/><br/>All, in all, I suggest that you get a copy of this movie on DVD and enjoy it for the entertaining story that it provides. But, one caveat, it is very gory and to be blunt, CORRECTLY so, Swords and spears and axes are not weapons of humane destruction."

","I will call this movie interesting. I liked the look of the movie and the flow of the film, but it had a lot of flaws to it. The first major flaw is that the Roman army is wearing chain mail and some have metal armor---which is 1,000 years prior to their invention. The army forms a shield wall during battle, which got my interest peaked, but when the enemy charged the Romans did not stay in the shield wall but rushed the enemy--Roman soldiers would have stayed in the shield wall and would have beaten that attack. The female antagonist defeats a ""celebrated"" Roman general in hand-to-hand combat---ridiculous. The lead is a former son of a gladiator who talks about how his father taught him to fight---thus he would have been more dangerous than the picts chasing them. The Romans flee from the picts rather than fight and the 7 surviving Romans would have probably beaten the pict hunting party with ease. Overall the historical part was a sham, but the picture was not as bad as you would think."

This film is very bloody sometimes to the point of being overdone, heads explode like cantaloupes at the slightest smash yet soldiers take numerous arrows and sword lashings and survive. Probably the silliest part of the whole story was the ability of beautiful 5ft 2in 100lb girls to battle guys twice their size wielding 3ft swords.

My advice is not to think about things as you watch it, maybe drink a few beers first and just enjoy the sword play such as it is. They seemed to put all the effort into blood splatter effects and not so much into choreographing the fight scenes though some scenes were good. I will say the right actors were in place and did there best. The film was entertaining as I was able to switch my brain off for most of the film! Not bad at all for an English film going by recent efforts!<br/><br/>For future ref to film makers hunters on horseback catching up to their prey and loosing them several times is not very realistic, these boys must have been olympic runners or something......<br/><br/>One final point, why were the romans the heroes of the film? it seems there's a lot of Brit bashing going on in films these days.

","I have never seen any of Neil Marshall's films, so this was the first of his films that I saw.

However it was more brutal than Gladiator, it was quite entertaining to watch. Some of the parts were a little too graphic for me though.<br/><br/>I understood where Marshall was going with this film, because it's about the disappearance of Rome's ninth legion and what might have caused them to vanish from history from his point of view. Most suggest that a Celtic tribe may have been responsible and there are doubts on whether the Legion reached Scotland or not.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender and Dominic West were good but I couldn't take them seriously as Roman soldiers and was very used to their roles as Spartans. Olga Kurylenko as the cold-hearted and brutal huntress did good but her role is not as memorable since her character remained mute the entire time.<br/><br/>Centurion is one of those movies that allows the audience to question which side is good and which side is bad.

It was fast-paced with lots of action, good cinematography, and good acting, yet it still lacked something, and I can't quite put my finger on it. It was incredibly brutal, bloody and gory - but then again so was '300', and I loved that movie. Maybe it was just too barbaric, and I didn't quite enjoy the characters. None of them really stood out for me, not even Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) as the hero. There was nothing special about him. He kept surviving attacks because every time luck was on his side, not because he was a strategist, or good fighter, or even clever enough to outsmart the enemy.<br/><br/>The main protagonist was Etain, but I didn't buy her character and I didn't feel Olga Kurylenko did the character justice.

","I know I shouldn't, but I'm incapable of watching any form of media surrounding the Roman Empire without my mind recalling every quote from the classic Monty Python film, 'The Life of Brian.' There, they were depicted as buffoons and lampooned mercilessly. I guess the people of the numerous lands they conquered in real life wouldn't have agreed too much with the escapades of Biggus Diccus and his cohorts.<br/><br/>'Centurion' is about the leader (Michael Fassbender) of a legion of doomed Roman troops, sent in to deal with the uprising locals in the north of England and, in particular, Scotland. Apparently, those Scots (or 'Picts' as they were really, back then) were dealing heavy losses to Roman battalions and something has to be done about it. Sadly, for most of Fassbender's party (and I'll keep calling him by the actor's name, seeing as every time I see a - supposedly - authentic Roman name of the period, I keep thinking it looks something like 'Naughtness Maximus!') they get completely wiped out, leaving just him and a handful of others on the run from a band of bloodthirsty locals.<br/><br/>And there is plenty of blood. It's not for the faint-hearted and there are plenty of limbs being hacked off left, right and centre. It's primarily one long chase film with action set-pieces thrown in. And it's all good if that's what you're looking for. I'm no historian, so I can't tell you if every Roman infantry man's costume is 100% accurate, or whether this was what it was like back then. But it is a fairly decent action film.<br/><br/>It's also well-directed, but then you'd expect that from Neil Marshall (the creative force behind such great little gems as 'Dog Soldiers, The Decent and Doomsday'). I would say that it's worth pausing while you're watching the film and ask yourself the question, 'Who are the 'real' good guys?' In 'Dog Soldiers' the werewolves were clearly the bad guys, then you had the monsters in 'The Decent' and the cannibal gangs in 'Doomsday.' Here, the Romans are clearly the underdogs, but, if you think about it, they are - technically - an invading and most unwelcome force in an occupied land, so are the Picts well within their rights to hack their heads off for fun?<br/><br/>I read somewhere that it's based on a true story. And when I say 'true' I mean in 'Hollywood terms,' i.e. there was a sort of account of something that happened that might be a bit like this and this film is one way that events COULD have unfolded. Anyway, it's still good fun. Although there are a few other actors in the film you may recognise from this or that, Fassbender is the only one that you'll remember (unless you count the mute psychotic lady Pict with her blue war-paint sent to dispatch him - I certainly wouldn't mess with her!).<br/><br/>There's a - pretty superfluous - love interest thrown in there, but it doesn't impact too much on the action and the gore. It's a fun little period action film that is definitely entertaining. Just try not to think of 'The Life of Brian' too much and shouting 'Bl**dy Romans!' too much at the screen while you watch it!"

Most likely this has to do with how few screens the movie opened with, just over 100 in the UK and about 25 in the US, presumably with no hype. (I never heard of it until seven years after it opened.) This is certainly not your average date movie unless both parties like their violence graphic. So much for the chancy, grim aspects of movie-making. (Almost as grim as the blood in this movie.)<br/><br/>The story and acting are pretty good for an adventure/survival yarn: A small band of survivors of an ambush must take a circuitous route through enemy territory to get home. The hero is the son of a gladiator whose father taught him all of his skills and tricks. The best villain is a fierce woman warrior who tracks down the Roman prey. She wears animal skins and war paint, never speaks or smiles, and wields a scary, partisan-like polearm as if it were an extension of her body and soul. (This is not only about guys doing macho stuff, it has a couple of macho women characters, too.)<br/><br/>If you do not mind the blood and gore, this is a great adventure story with amazing photography of untamed Scottish mountain country. An interesting note (to me, anyway): The Romans speak English instead of Latin while the Picts speak Scots Gaelic instead of Pictish. Very little Pictish has been preserved, but from what we know of it, it would have been more similar to Gaelic than English is to Latin."

A lot of violence and gore, but done with a surprisingly good taste. But it seriously lacked believable plot and character development. I know that making this kind of films are expensive and hard but they could have paid a few pounds more to the scriptwriter to make a true epic. Men are just meat here and the women...a little more... The talented cast could have made more of their roles. Obviously the Hollywood credo of action and entertainment makes money corrupted this film like so many others. Still highly recommended despite its faults."

Maybe a subplot ( to explain a bit more about the 'captivated woman' or how the centurion became one or how did it end so far from Rome or something ...) to give more layers to the film.<br/><br/>The scenes of the battles were good.

"globaltrooper","6","0","3","23 February 2016"," High-Expectations Will Disappoint... Not Bad Though
","Neil Marshall's Centurion (2010) doesn't hold a candle to movies like 300 (2006) or Gladiator (2000), and thus high-expectations will leave action-movie fanatics sorely disappointed. The predictable plot of men running for their lives behind enemy lines, is saturated with desensitizing gore, and it's cliché formula is just interesting enough to be called, entertaining. <br/><br/>There is nothing unique about the common adventure movie. The film opens with a helicopter shot of the jagged snowcaps in Highland Scotland, transporting the audience into the edge of the Roman Empire in 117 A.D.E. where an honorable centurion, Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), is fleeing from his Pict captors. Dias finds refuge with the god like General Titus (Dominic West), the leader of the Roman Ninth Legion and the exotic and mute Pict tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko), who have ""come looking for a fight."" Etain's tongue was cut out by Roman soldiers and for unspeakable atrocities she only craves Roman blood. She knowingly leads them into a ambush, which results in mass Roman casualties and the capture of Titus. Dias and the remaining men attempt to rescue their beloved General, but as they are relentlessly hunted by Etain, the idea of returning home seems further away then ever. <br/><br/>Marshall's attention for detail, his choice in camera angles, and even the breathtaking location in which he directs the film are remnants of his past works. Like in his horror movie The Descent (2005) he is an artist in crafting brutal scenes of death. The angles in which he chooses to display these scenes of blood and entrails are quite familiar; a low angle shows bodies being rolled on top of the camera, a nameless character has a quick close up right before his throat is slit, and numerous wide shots show rich red blood paint the dull gray and snow white landscape. The location itself of Highland Scotland is beautiful, but it's nothing new; Marshall's Dog Soldiers (2002) is filmed in similar woods and mountains in Luxembourg.<br/><br/>In regards to the actual performances, West utilizes every moment to capture the audiences attention. His hunched shoulders, devilish smile, and brooding brow create an ape like countenance for Titus, who is a true man of the legion, which makes him so loved by his men. Kurylenko conveys emotions of rage through her facial expressions to make up for her lack of lines, but her character is by no means dynamic. By nature Etain is the epitome of vengeance and wears an eternal visage of hate. Fassbender is a convincing hero who maintains true dignity and honor even when other minor characters fail to meet his morality or when actors fail to perform. <br/><br/>Despite the unoriginal plot it leads to no disruption in the flow of the film. It is constantly a predictable sequence of events. There is even time in this 97 minute film for a romance between Fassbender and Imogen Poots. Though the chemistry is a little forced it's not horrible, it's even appropriate to close the movie. Marshall brings nothing new to the table, but fanatics of this genera will be pleased with the gore which has been CGI'd, the shallow plot, and the transcending terrain."
"Leofwine_draca","8","0","4","26 December 2015"," CGI blood aside, this one's a keeper
","When I first heard about CENTURION, I was excited: I'm a big fan of director Neil Marshall (yes, even his much-lamented DOOMSDAY) and I absolutely adore historical romps, so this was a match made in heaven. When I finally sat down to watch the Blu-ray of this film, I wasn't disappointed. CENTURION is a lean, pared-down adventure romp made on a low budget and with a plot that's simplistic in the extreme: a squad of Roman soldiers are cut off behind enemy lines and have to find their way to safety. It's nothing new; this kind of story has been done in multiple settings and with multiple variants on the theme (SOUTHERN COMFORT, in which a gang of US soldiers are pursued by bloodthirsty Cajuns, is a favourite), but the reason it's so popular is that it's easy to get right. Marshall gets it spot on.<br/><br/>My main beef with the film is that it's too short, focusing on action over plotting. I would have liked another half hour of dialogue and plot. However, like the recent RAMBO, the extra-short running time works in its favour, never giving the viewer time to get bored or dwell upon the various shortcomings in the characterisation and atmosphere. A bunch of interesting actors are cast in this one, and for the most part they do well; Michael Fassbender is an able, everyman hero, and Dominic West great as the shouty, sweaty, hard-drinking general. Marshall did well to cast character actors like David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham as the likable old-timers of the group, while Noel Clarke is underutilised as another. For the females, the beautiful Olga Kurylenko is well characterised and pretty terrifying as the vengeful Pictish warrior chasing our heroes, and Imogen Poots has a brief but important role as an ethereal outcast.<br/><br/>The emphasis here is very much on the action, and there's plenty of it to go round. The initial attack on the 9th legion is expertly staged and full of intense, bloody conflict a la BRAVEHEART. The subsequent bouts are on a much smaller scale, but still vicious and shocking, with decapitation a favoured method of execution for the bloodthirsty Picts. A fight between West and Kurylenko is a stand out moment, as is the final showdown between the whittled-down survivors and their pursuers. My only complaint with the action is the over-reliance on CGI blood, but then you can't have everything, and it's not as bad as that seen elsewhere. For me, CENTURION is a keeper and a film I'll look forward to revisiting."

"bozabozidar","7","0","3","13 June 2015"," Thrilling historic fiction movie with a disappointing end
","Centurion by Neil Marshall is set in Ancient Britain during the Roman conquest and is very loosely based on some obscure historic facts. The movie follows the titular character, Quintus Dia (Michael Fassbender), who during one night in a camp gets captured by Picts, a vicious tribe that defiantly fights against Romans. However, he is soon rescued by a legion led by General Virilus (Dominic West). This victory does not lost long, because this legion soon gets ambushed by Picts. Most of the Romans are killed, the General gets captured, so a very small group of survivors has to fight its way through the harsh wilderness and evade a hunting party led by the ruthless mute Etain (Olga Kurylenko).<br/><br/>The movie lacks any large-scale proportions and instead focuses on several characters. Dia, Bothos (David Morrissey) and Brick (Liam Cunningham) are the main characters, and most other characters die quite easily. Arianne (Imogen Poots) was originally supposed to be an important character with an interesting back-story, but that was changed and she is just a minor character in the movie. Although the fight scenes are mostly small and with only a few participants, they are extremely violent and gritty. You rarely get to see so much gore and blood in similar movies, so Centurion is unusual with its superbly done gore effects. People often get graphically stabbed with spears, swords or arrows and they sure do bleed a lot, which looks amazing and quite realistic.<br/><br/>One of the best things in the movie is the beautiful scenery. The movie shows various landscapes of Britain, such as forests, plains, rivers, hills etc, which look breath-taking. There are even some scenes where the actors really run across some snowy mountains in the freezing weather. Filming all these landscapes must have been quite difficult and few film-makers would put so much effort in it.<br/><br/>The ending is something I dislike greatly about this movie, since it's very anticlimactic. There is no big battle between Romans and Picts; instead the plot changes and the last few minutes of the movie are spent portraying the Romans as the bad guys (but not the main characters). Personally, I find this extremely disappointing and badly executed, so it's probably the weakest part of the movie.<br/><br/>So, if you like gritty action scenes and movies about Ancient Rome, feel free to watch Centurion. Its ending is quite problematic and most of the scenes are relatively simple, but the movie does have many good moments."
"Seraphion","6","0","4","14 October 2014"," Interesting story with unbalanced acting
","The story opens nicely with that kind of scene, and the narration also makes it more interesting by stating it's not the end and it's not the start of the story. The rest of the story develops well, although very much predictable. The good the thing is that the're's plenty of action to see in this movie, provided that the viewers have a strong stomach to swallow down all the quite disturbing imagery. The twists are quickly foreseeable yet some of them are quite unclear when they happen. The acting is strangely unbalanced in overall. Michael Fassbender and Imogen Poots did great expressions work in their close up shots. Fassbender's action scenes are also quite well done. But Olga Kurylenko's acting lacks expression, presenting only one face throughout the entire movie."
"czaya-1","8","0","4","14 June 2014"," A good Film that could have been Great
","Centurion is a good movie that could have been a great movie. With the exception of a few silly and foolish scenes, time restrictions, and poor decisions by the Director, Centurion could have been much better than it was. The word funny should not apply to this film in any way. The Roman situation in Britain or the campaign of the Roman 9th Legion is not humorous. Unfortunately the Director tries to add humor to this film by adding scenes which give the viewer the impression of this being a Monty Python production. Barbarians screaming out a battle cry 200 feet away from Roman soldiers is just beyond foolish. It gives away the element of surprise and is not realistic in any way. Nor is it adding any kind of real humor to the film. It only leaves the viewer shaking his head in disgust and disbelief that such foolish scenes were actually included in this film. Also the whole situation Thax created when killing the Pict King's son makes no sense at all. If Thax did not smother the boy to death when they were trying to rescue their General, the Roman soldiers would have been captured or killed right then and there. This was a damned if I do, damned if I don't situation for Thax. This scenario leaves the viewer puzzled and gives the film a makes no sense kind of ending. Beside these things I have mentioned, this is a good movie which is well worth watching."
"The_Dead_See","6","0","4","31 August 2013"," Reasonably entertaining pseudo-historical actioner but don't expect big battles
","I still haven't figured out if I'm a fan of Neil Marshall. I love 'The Descent' and 'Dog Soldiers' to bits, but neither 'Doomsday' or 'Centurion' really hit the mark for me. Neither of them were *bad* but neither really got far above average either.<br/><br/>The first thing mention is that if you're looking for big battles involving hundreds of extras or thousands of CGI characters, look elsewhere. One might expect that a film specifically about the loss of the mythical Roman ninth legion to the warrior tribes of Scotland would involve some kind of grand scale clash, but there's no such thing offered here. Centurion is about a handful of survivors from the legion fleeing across the bleak highland mountains while group of vengeful Picts pursues them and picks them off one by one. At it's core it's very similar to a backwoods slasher type flick such as Wrong Turn or Deliverance.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining enough scenario though, and Michael Fassbender and Olga Kurylenko put in fine performances as the principle adversaries. The films moves along at a good old click and there's not much time to get bored. <br/><br/>There are two things that Centurion does in droves, though, that I personally don't enjoy. The first is the use of a 45 degree shutter angle during every action scene to give it that 'hyper kinetic' look that Spielberg introduced us to in Saving Private Ryan (where it worked) and Ridley Scott followed up with in Gladiator (where it barely worked). But Marshall, as talented as he is, is no Spielberg or Scott, and the hyper kinetics in Centurion yanked me out of the movie every time an action scene began. It's a big shame because otherwise the action was pretty well choreographed and satisfyingly violent.<br/><br/>The second thing I don't like (and there is NO movie where this technique works) is CGI bloodletting. Centurion strives to go one step further than, say, Braveheart in the brutality of its combat. Limbs and heads go flying left right and center. It's perhaps not quite as over the top as ""Ironclad"" but it's close. The dude in me likes this of course, but give me blood bags and prosthetics any day. The CGI blood and dismemberment of Centurion seemed simply unrealistic and distracting.<br/><br/>Despite these two pet peeves of mine, Centurion is still a silly, fun flick that unashamedly eschews historical accuracy in favor of good old action entertainment. It could have been much, much better though - with a bit of a screenplay polish and more careful directing choices - so I can't in good conscience give it much more than a 6/10."

Oh, and Olga Kurylenko really keeps her mouth shut in the entire film.<br/><br/>On the negative side, OK, you have historical inaccuracies; will have to endure seeing two or three female warriors fight and oh, a (somehow) predictable ending, but that's no reason for ranting so much.<br/><br/>To sum it up, a film like this does not deserve such reviews or rating so it's a 8/10 from me.<br/><br/>It's a pity that IMDb does not ""sort"" the user reviews based on the similarities between us (the registered visitor) and the reviewers based on our combined ratings, in order to avoid reading reviews from people light years apart.

"kkhannah","6","0","5","3 December 2011"," Decent enough.
","I will say right off the bat that I am not a historian, by any stretch of the imagination; however, I do have a liking for films that deal with most eras of history, especially the Roman Empire. With this in mind and my liking for Michael Fassbender, I decided to give this film a try. <br/><br/>My overall consensus: this film was neither terrific or horrifically bad, but there were more bad aspects than good. One thing that rather grated on my nerves was the lack of character development. I understand that it is difficult to fully develop seven or so characters but having them tell their backstories in one scene seems almost like a pitiful attempt. Speaking of said scene, the only character who doesn't say anything about their past is Centurion Quintus. For being the main character, there really wasn't much of a reason to care for him. <br/><br/>The first forty five minutes or so of the film are certainly the best. After that, it descends into a rather formulaic chase film, where characters are killed off left and right and all we can really do is shrug. The film also features a brief romantic subplot that is never really explored and truly feels unnecessary until the end of the film. <br/><br/>The film wasn't without its positive aspects, however. For those who are fans of gory battle scenes, Centurion certainly delivers, featuring some good hack and slash battles with gratuitous blood involved. Michael Fassbender also does a decent enough job in his role, working with the script he had to become the only character I really cared about. Overall, if you are a fan of dubiously accurate historical films (like I am), then Centurion certainly isn't a waste of an hour and a half. If this isn't your preferred genre, then I'd recommend giving it a pass."

","Strange movie depicting a nation so remote their name was unknown to a mighty empire .Invaders as heroes and natives as insurgents (sound familiar ? ) Here is a quote attributed to Calgacus the Pictish leader : Whenever I consider the origin of this war and the necessities of our position, I have a sure confidence that this day, and this union of yours, will be the beginning of freedom to the whole of Britain. To all of us slavery is a thing unknown; there are no lands beyond us, and even the sea is not safe, menaced as we are by a Roman fleet. And thus in war and battle, in which the brave find glory, even the coward will find safety. Former contests, in which, with varying fortune, the Romans were resisted, still left in us a last hope of succour, inasmuch as being the most renowned nation of Britain, dwelling in the very heart of the country, and out of sight of the shores of the conquered, we could keep even our eyes unpolluted by the contagion of slavery. To us who dwell on the uttermost confines of the earth and of freedom, this remote sanctuary of Britain's glory has up to this time been a defence. Now, however, the furthest limits of Britain are thrown open, and the unknown always passes for the marvellous. But there are no tribes beyond us, nothing indeed but waves and rocks, and the yet more terrible Romans, from whose oppression escape is vainly sought by obedience and submission. Robbers of the world, having by their universal plunder exhausted the land, they rifle the deep. If the enemy be rich, they are rapacious; if he be poor, they lust for dominion; neither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them. Alone among men they covet with equal eagerness poverty and riches. To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire; they make a solitude and call it peace.

","Michael Fassbender stars in this tale of Roman soldiers in the AD hundreds whose army was conquered and disintegrated by a troublesome war-clan called the Picts. As their General was captured and their army lines splintered, the remaining survivors headed by Fassbender went on a mission to save their imprisoned general.<br/><br/>The movie in itself was fun. It is not ground breaking cinema or anything like that. It is a gore festival not shying on battles and spears and axes that mutilated and bloodied whoever its poor target is. Heads are decapitated right on screen, throats cut and not just implied, fountain of blood flows freely in the battle sequences, body parts are hacked off in gruesome fashion – all in all a nice violent take of realism on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The film is as entertaining as it gets in a classic spin of cat and mouse. The Roman hunters who are trying to conquer the vast lands of Great Britain are now the hunted, trying to run away from the guerilla Picts. Leading the hunting Picts is a She-Wolf mute named Etain (Olga Kurylenko from the Quantum of Solace fame). On the other side are the hunted Roman soldiers trying to do the best they can to survive together – even if it means eating from a stomach of a dead stag, jumping off a cliff and just running by foot as the visuals take the audience to beautiful images of Britain. It has a Seven Samurai element in it too, where strangers with a common cause must band together to achieve their goal.<br/><br/>The cinematography did remind me of Lord of the Rings at some parts. How certain scenes were shot was quite amusing and cool. It has that sweeping effect that takes you right on the action. Battle visuals are edited in quick cuts and succession that make you feel like you are the one doing the hacking and fraying. While the edit in the action scenes is great, transitions to setting another scene is a corny cross-fade that makes it look like a fan video on YouTube.<br/><br/>Another of the movie's strength is the cast. Fassbender is now on the rise as one of the most formidable actors in Hollywood right now. He is effective as the titular holder of the film – charismatic, beautiful, and will make you want to root for him. <br/><br/>The stand out for me though is Dominic West, the charming general Virilus who led the army against the guerilla fight. He was engaging at the very moment he was introduced and lovable too. One soldier even commented that he would die for his general. And I totally understand why because I sense it on how West plays him. I totally understand why people would die for his character.<br/><br/>The film by the end introduced a romance subplot which I think came out of nowhere but I'm OK with it. The girl (Imogen Poots) is so beautiful! Her eyes are amazing. Maybe this is the reason why the romance sits well with me.<br/><br/>The thing that I hate about this film is Etain's character being a spearwife and besting Roman soldiers. It's as if every movie right now should have a girl power element. Not to mention that this girl is the greatest tracker, leader, smart and badass fighter of the Picts. I don't know why but it somehow ruined the film.<br/><br/>It's still fun though."

Problem is that the over the top splish- splash gutting and cutting just seems slightly out of place here considering, the movie tries to be rather serious. Now attempts of giving the movie meaning are the other thing that seems out of place, so where does this leave us...?<br/><br/>Now not that Neil Marshal would be a useless director, I just think he was the wrong guy to give this movie to. Or if this was his attempt to emerge as a ""serious"" movie maker maybe he should have refrained from the gore and give attention to the characters I guess.<br/><br/>I'd wish he'd go back to movies with smaller scope, I want more of The Decent, where his abilities where sufficient and more then welcome. I just don't see any potential in him directing something of luminous range, if for nothing else, then for the fact that he can't get over himself with the gore.

","The romance didn't start until the last third of the movie. But, it was much better than I had expected given the IMDb rating. The costumes and atmosphere had a very authentic feel - at least as far as the 21st century rendition goes. Much of the movie setting felt like the beginning of Gladiator in Germania. Although I think the bad-a$$ femme fatal role is an overrated character part, our feminist-indoctrinated society seems to love it. Olga Kurylenko plays the baggage-laden she-wolf pretty well anyway - and at least she doesn't talk. The romantic interest, in my view, did a much better job at developing a feminine role that real men could appreciate, even so late in the movie. I honestly wasn't expecting that, but I was glad she did finally come to the rescue, because she saved the movie from being a straight action no plot flop.

Felt the shots kept the movie moving feeling like it was the legions last desperations, you felt the reality of them being somewhat unable to win. But as always you have to find a way to make men feel better about themselves wen they're getting kicked. And that's when they find an outcast of the Pict tribesmen. This outcast is a fine beauty who helps the remaining crew survive & rest up. This movie doesn't lack in emotional depth like most war movies seem to do. It slowed down enough & shared enough halfhearted laughs to feel for these guys. In another form, this movie somewhat reminded me of a robin hood story since no one seemed to know who & what they were fighting 4. These men were betrayed & some betrayed some in the group, but the select few stuck together like Saving Private Ryan men. Music was off and on & kept it somewhat current but laid in the old dungeon like industrial feel to it.
