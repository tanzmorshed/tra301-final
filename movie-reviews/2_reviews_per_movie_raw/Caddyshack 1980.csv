","`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10."

","Crudeness doesn't come much more, well, crude, than 1980's sublime ""Caddyshack"". In fact, this crazy quilt takes the slob groundwork laid by ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" and one-ups that collegiate comedy classic by having a carelessly mean, anarchic spirit a mile wide and a foot deep. <br/><br/>It's little surprise that writer/director Harold Ramis and co-writer Douglas Kenney were also scribes on that 1978 John Belushi hit. As ""Caddyshack"" shows, the classic us-versus-them scat-humor template is alive and well. <br/><br/>But this is not just a crass comedy, it's a HAPPILY crass comedy, that does just about whatever it wants as it casually wanders through it's 90-odd minutes. The DNA of ""Caddyshack"" resides somewhere in the cinematic in-between world of the aforementioned ""Animal House"" and a Three Stooges or W.C. Fields picture. There's a giddiness to its nose-thumbing, and a general pleasure in its coarse eagerness to offend.<br/><br/>The screenplay forms a functional spine for what actually amounts to a comedy collision course of witty asides, broad physical comedy, dirty jokes, varied comedic styles and big explosions.<br/><br/>But is there really a screenplay here? The film has such a loose and free-wheeling timbre to it that it would be hard not to fault the viewer in thinking that the film was largely improvised, or at least rewritten by committee on set, scene by scene.<br/><br/>This film was widely *rumoured* to be ""under the influence"" during shooting, but whatever the cast and crew were ""using"" seemed to work very much in favor of movie, as the flick turned out to be editorially messy and open-structured, yet well-paced and coherent enough to embrace the variety of comedic opinions squeezed into the picture. This is what you get - a smörgåsbord of laughs. You get a Chevy Chase doing his ironic bit, you have one Bill Murray essaying a bizarre-o mental case, good old Ted Knight going into slow-burn histrionics every scene, and Rodney Dangerfield stealing every scene with large chunks of his stand-up act. This shouldn't work, this mix - but it does. Very well. <br/><br/>Again, the looseness of the pace and tone of the film forgive some of the storytelling framework featuring young go-getter Michael O'Keefe's attempt to get a college scholarship during one crazy summer caddying for Bushwood Country Club's weirdest members. Instead, Ramis, Kenney and (Bill's brother) Brian Doyle Murray set each of these comedians up with sketch-like scenarios for some of their finest and funniest work.<br/><br/>The movie is mean in all the right places - It's the snobs against the slobs, as the advertising says. ""Caddyshack"" takes barbed pot-shots at the class system, at sex, at religion, at bodily functions. No joke is too risqué, no candy bar too gross to eat from the bottom of a empty pool. It has lots of swearing, nudity for nudity's sake, and insults for the pompous and pathetic. Even through its R-rated mean-spiritedness, it's hard to truly be turned off of the film's antagonistic spirit - it earns it's laughs because it's breathlessly paced and damned funny. This is the thematic mold that the Farrellys and Adam Sandler rarely get right. <br/><br/>""Caddyshack"" is endlessly quotable, and surely if you sat around with a few friends anytime in the last 25 years, you could probably spend a good hour reciting lines and scenes that still hold all their glorious funny these many years later. <br/><br/>The movie's best scene? My award goes to the ""Night Putting"" sequence where Chevy Chase's Ty Webb and Bill Murray Carl the Greenskeeper finally meet up when Chase fires a Titleist through the window of Murray's lean-to shed-slash-residence. This never fails to get big laughs, and it's a real meeting of the minds. A great sequence for the Comedy Hall of Fame, I'd say. <br/><br/>Kenny Loggins' catchy songs (""I'm Alright"" anyone?) and the jazzy Johnny Mandel (!) orchestral score add a unexpectedly lovely sheen that spit-shines the crudity of subject and filmmaker's style. They're nice touches.<br/><br/>You can put ""Caddyshack"" next to ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" - not just in the ""C"" section of your local video store, but as in ""Classic"". Comedies don't come much funnier than this. <br/><br/>BTW - skip ""Caddyshack II"". Everything that this one is, that one isn't."

","Yes, this one does hold up, perhaps because the action centers on the almost surreal (for a comedy) subject of golf, a topic that had not perhaps been so successfully spoofed since Eddie Cantor starred in ""Kid Boots"" (am I getting that one right?).  <br/><br/>In the comedy contest between Murray, Chase, and Dangerfield, let me just say that Chase does not win.  Dangerfield is at his best, delivering his classic lines (""this meat's so tough you can see where the jockey was riding it"") with ultimate panache and actually playing his crazy character (reminiscent of Peter Sellars in ""The Party"") to the hilt.  Murray is really the show-stopper, though, muttering his lines to give them emphasis (?) and racing around the course with what appears to be real mania. <br/><br/>
A lot of the jokes fall flat, but when this movie is on, it's so on, that you can't help but call it a classic."

","When you watch Caddyshack, you think to yourself that this is rather lowbrow.  Then you disregard that part of your brain and settle down for some lowbrow fun. Chevy Chase has top billing, and he's very good.  He's very calm, very funny, and quick witted. But the ones who nearly steal the show are Ted Knight and Bill Murray.  Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield play off each other nicely.  Knight gets flustered and starts stammering, and you can see every vein on his neck!  Dangerfield counters with a crack at Knight's expense and it gets better from there.  Bill Murray is great as Carl, the groundskeeper with a vendetta against that gopher.  He mumbles things to himself, watches old ladies play golf and develops his own grass that can be smoked after playing golf on it.  And always remember Ty Webb's words of wisdom: ""A flute with no holes is not a flute, and a donut with no holes is a danish."""

","You don't have to like golf to love Caddyshack. Along with Animal House, it's the best slobs vs. snobs movie ever. I've read reviews here going into tiresome depth about why the movie isn't funny. That's the first problem. If you're spending a lot of time & energy to explain why you hate Caddyshack, you're probably a ton of fun in real life. The film is full of so many quotable lines, it's criminal. Everyone in the cast is perfect and if you're not laughing out loud, you're grinning till the end. Mostly, if you don't find Caddyshack funny, there's probably something wrong with you. That's not an opinion."

","So now you've got that going for you, which is nice.<br/><br/>Inspired by Brian Doyle-Murray's experiences as a caddy in his youth, this wild, anarchic film is about more than just golf. Without a doubt, it's my favorite comedy, and might even be one of the greatest movies of all time. There is not a single scene without comedic chaos.<br/><br/>Director Harold Ramis is barely able to contain the insanity. There is honestly so much in Caddyshack, there's enough for ten movies, hardly surprising since the first draft of the screenplay was 199 pages long while the first cut of the film run for 310 minutes. I imagine that there's enough cut out to make whole new Caddyshack movies. There are about five different plots developing at once throughout the movie, the funniest of which is Carl Spackler's (having been licensed to kill by the 'Government of the United Nations') attempts to assassinate a rogue gopher tearing up the golf course.<br/><br/>Each and every actor battles with each other, and it's hard to nail down exactly who runs away with the movie, but if I absolutely HAD to choose, I'd say that Rodney Dangerfield's sleazy, slobbish, overly-friendly, and gratuitously tipping character is the most wonderful thing about it. He is the perfect foil for Judge Smails (an utterly perfectly-cast Ted Knight), a pompous, bad-tempered, self-important hypocrite who wants to reserve the pretentious Bushwood Country Club for snobs and gentlemen (despite being far from a gentleman himself).<br/><br/>If you like comedy quotes, Caddyshack is a goldmine. There are hundreds, literally hundreds, of lines worthy of repeating in real life. You could literally get by, from cradle to the grave, just quoting Caddyshack, and it would bring you nothing but pure happiness and good fortune."

","Caddyshack is one of the great all time classics of it's time. For any golf enthusiast this is a must see. Also, If you just like plain comedy this is a must see. I have seen this movie over 100 times and I still laugh to this day. Bill Murray plays one of the funniest roles that ever hit the big screen. After you see this movie you start repeating sayings that you hear in the movie. The late Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield are hilarious. If you are a Chevy Chase fan you must see him in this role. The role of Ty is the one that opened the door for Chase in such movies as Vacation, Fletch, Spies like us, Three Maiga's and Funny Farm. This movie is one that everyone should have in their DVD collection. You can watch it over and over again and laugh out loud every time. This movie rates on par with Animal House.

","CADDYSHACK is one of the Top 5 funniest movies of all time. The show-stealer is obviously Rodney Dangerfield, who also happens to be the coolest old dude ever. His outrageous lines such as ""Did somebody step on a duck?"" are all knee-slappers. Another standout is Carl Spackler, played perfectly by Bill Murray. Carl is a goofy groundskeeper that is obsessed with killing a mischevious gopher. Some of the funniest parts in this movie are Murray's ad-libs. Unfortunately, the plotline of the caddies is overlooked by the outstanding performances by comedic stars such as Dangerfield, Murray, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight. While CADDYSHACK is an absolute classic, CADDYSHACK 2 is a bomb and fails to live up to the hilarity of this one."

","Ah, yes, Caddyshack.  The king of low brow comedies.  I remember working at my dad's San Leandro restaurant as a young jerk and loving the sound of the Kenny Loggins' ""I'm Alright"" theme song as they played Caddyshack on the big screen TV's in between sports games.  That friggin' song made me wanna jump down and rock out, baby!<br/><br/>Caddyshack isn't so much a movie as it is an excuse for a bunch of one liners, gross outs, and stand-up comedy schtick.  Chevy Chase, Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield were at their funniest in this movie.<br/><br/>In fact, this movie was made back when Chevy Chase WAS still funny. Remember those days?  Man, was that a while ago.  I read an article recently where a reporter asked Chevy, ""What happened to your career?""  And Chevy looked totally pained and wounded at that cruel question.  Chevy's a great comic actor, he just needs to track down another decent script like the one in Caddyshack and get his comic chops back on track. But I dig everything about this film, the background music, the great comedy gags, the gopher, even the look of the ritzy, snob ridden country club setting!  Freeze gopher!"
"patricio-53898","10","11","17","11 May 2017"," An anomaly of a film.
","I've watched this film at least twice a year for a quarter of a century, and the last time I watched it, I realized something: this film is an anomaly. It shouldn't exist as a classic of comedic cinema yet, against all odds, it does. The story is pretty unimportant and there is almost nothing in the way of cogent plot or character development. Furthermore, it objectively fails as pretty much any formulaic type of comedy film. It fails as a romantic comedy, it fails as a coming of age story, and it fails as a class comedy despite its tagline of ""the snobs against the slobs"". However, like a McDonald's cheeseburger, it's greater than the sum of its parts. Taken individually, their ingredients are awful. But when you put them together, I don't know, it just works. I'm of the opinion that the reason that it remains a classic, and that countless golfers across the world chant ""na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na- na-na-na"" as they putt, is squarely on the shoulders of the brilliant performances of the cast. Some of the greatest comedic actors of that era, namely Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Chevy Chase, are firmly on their A Game here, and are absolutely sublime in this film. And with the help of the great Harold Ramis behind the camera, they raise these characters that should've been easily forgotten to some of the most quoted in the history of comedy. It shouldn't have worked, but it did. This film is not for everyone. If you aren't tickled by these performances, then there's very little to hold your interest. And I get that. But that's the way comedy works. It either hits you or it doesn't. And this film still makes me laugh out loud every single time. And I imagine that it probably always will."

","What is the point of a movie about teenage caddies running around, chasing women, smoking grass, and causing all sorts of shenanigans? Only to create one of the greatest comedies of this or any time period. If you are looking for a movie that will keep you laughing from start to finish, look no further my friends. Caddyshack captures the youthful spirit of teens and the country club life to perfection.<br/><br/>Every character in this film has something about them that makes them uniquely hilarious. Judge Smails, played by Ted Knight, contributes to the comedy with his gut busting mannerisms and his contagious laugh. Ty Webb, played by Chevy Chase, is a wise cracking man who loves to stick it to the man. Then we have Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) who is the lovable, yet rambunctious, caddy who is just trying to find his way in the world. Quite possibly the funniest character in any sports movie is Carl Spackler (Bill Murray). This character is the glue of the film. His idiotic manner and constant abuse of alcohol makes for a performance that will be remembered for generations. Last but certainly not least is Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield). While at times he is very juvenile, his antics fit right in at Bushwood Country Club.<br/><br/>There are three S's that make a successful comedy movie, sex, silliness, and soundtrack. With the very sexy Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), all of the characters previously mentioned, and a gopher dancing to ""I'm Alright"" by Kenny Logins, this film is more than a success, it is a masterpiece."
"BandSAboutMovies","10","5","7","11 April 2019"," Perhaps the greatest movie ever.
","I ask you this: why did they keep making movies after Caddyshack? This is as perfect as film gets, quite literally a movie that you can drop into and out of at any time with your damage to the timing or spirit of the film. It has never failed to lift my mood or make me feel better about life. It is all that movies should endeavor to be.<br/><br/>It's based on the memories of writer and co-star Brian Doyle-Murray as he worked as a caddy at the Indian Hill Club in Winnetka, Illinois, along with his brothers Bill and John. Director Harold Ramis had also worked as a caddy and even been hit in the genitals with a golf ball once, just like the film. Even better - that Baby Ruth candy bar in the pool came directly from Murray's high school.<br/><br/>Is there a plot? Sure, Danny Noonan is supposedly the hero and its all about how he wants to escape his huge family and go to college. But really, it's the personalities that this movie is all about, like Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), the son of one of the club's founders who has turned slack into zen. Then there's Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), who is perhaps the best bad guy ever in a comedy. Or newly rich construction boss Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) who is a buffoonish man out to annoy every wealthy person in the club. And of course, there's Carl Spackler, the groundskeeper who is at war with a gopher.<br/><br/>It's also the only movie where Chase and Murray appear in a scene together. Famously brawling on the set of Saturday Night Live once, where Murray referred to Chase as ""medium talent"" before punching him - the best insult ever - they got along here and wrote a quick moment where Ty's golf ball ends up in Spackler's ramshackle hovel.<br/><br/>Murray dialogue in the film is completely unscripted, including his Cinderella story scene. There, he was told only to act as if he were a child announcing his own imaginary golf moment. He was only on set for six days.<br/><br/>The constant improv really bothered Knight, an actor who prided himself on knowing his lines. Dangerfield never did the same take twice, so their constant battling has its roots in reality. In fact, Rodney would never begin doing anything when Ramis yelled ""Action!"" Instead, he had to be told, ""Rodney, do your bit.""<br/><br/>The original cut of this film was around 4 and a half hours with Bill Murray's Cinderella speech coming in at around half an hour. No one was happy with the second cut, so the gopher was added at the last minute to give the movie some structure. It was shot on a soundstage, so that's why the film stock in these scenes looks completely different.<br/><br/>Caddyshack was a failure upon release and was hated by critics. It's gone on to show them all the error of their ways.<br/><br/>Sadly, writer Doug Kenney would never see this movie be embraced. At the press conference for this film, he drunkenly yelled at reporters, convinced it would be the end of his Hollywood career. A trip soon after to Hawaii with Chase lifted his spirits, but only for a brief time. He either slipped on a rock or jumped while there and was dead at 33, leaving behind work with the National Lampoon and the film Animal House along with this one. You can learn more about Kenney in the movie A Futile and Stupid Gesture."

","If you liked Memento, Caddyshack is worth seeing. The same technique of forgetting what you were doing thirty seconds after you begin doing it, and perpetually restarting from scratch seems to be the operating technique here. Except that it applies not to the characters in the film, but to the writer and director, Harold Ramis.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is a series of sketches that claim to be a movie, but are really far less than the sum of their parts. There are a few good comedy bits  surprisingly, Chevy Chase is good in an understated way that is cumulatively funnier as time goes by  and Rodney Dangerfield brings the frenetic quality and smart-alecky trademark schtick up front and center that is occasionally pretty good.<br/><br/>But the whole film never gets going. Now, I'm not someone who thinks that you have to have a John Sayles plot in a comedy. I'm fine with any amount of utterly improbable nonsense if it moves the comedy along. But that doesn't happen here. Stars are perpetually arriving, doing their little set piece, and then disappearing: so much so that I found myself saying, ""it sure was funnier when ----------- was on screen  say, whatever happened to them anyway?"" about a dozen times. Then, at some point with no relation to anything, they'd appear in a different scene and the process would repeat.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that it's a damned GOLF MOVIE. What the hell? A movie aimed at the Animal House crowd about GOLF??? And the problem there is that there's no template to lampoon. Airplane! is, without a doubt, the funniest film in the last 40 years, mostly because it took the mickey out of all those turgid Airport movies that preceded it, and the whole disaster movie thing. It meant that the jokes could be quick, ceaseless and merciless, and it meant that you kept missing jokes because you were almost crying with laughter from the previous one.<br/><br/>In Caddyshack, the whole thing is endless setups for a single lame joke. Ramis does try the parody thing with a little incident in a swimming pool that references Jaws, but it takes five minutes to get through, and the joke has come and gone way before the punchline, which is then totally anticlimactic.<br/><br/>Probably the best way and reason to watch Caddyshack, apart from ninja training to learn to overcome suffering silently, is as a perspective on Groundhog Day, which is the SECOND funniest movie in the last 40 years, and for reasons that are entirely due to its own genius. It brings together three elements from Caddyshack: Ramis, again as writer producer; a groundhog; and Bill Murray, who, if you want to see evidence of progress of a great comedian, you need do no more than compare these two films, made 13 years apart.<br/><br/>In Caddyshack, Murray is a kind of template for what Jim Carrey started out as: a Jerry Lewis style goof that get laughs from, well, people who think Jerry Lewis is a genius, and gags that depend on what one can only call a ""retard"" persona, which is not funny. All three of these comedians managed to demonstrate at some point in their career that there was some brilliance and control in their comedy, and got way, way better results out of it: Murray in many films, especially Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, and Broken Flowers; Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Truman Story and a few others; and Lewis in The King of Comedy  in its own way the THIRD funniest movie in the last 40 years. Somehow the effect of each of these was to make everything they'd done earlier all the more intolerable."

It's supposed to be a movie, but it feels like a clip show. The many subplots everyone goes on about are incoherent and go nowhere, the main character is unengaging, supporting characters kind of show up and then disappear or switch personalities, and too many of the gags are recycled jokes. Even Ramis, the directer, has said he ""can barely watch it. All I see are a bunch of compromises and things that could have been better"". It's not the worst movie i've seen, but i'm getting really sick of seeing it on top 10 lists."

","Here's another one of those movies I'd seen years ago and fell in love with. But now, in the cold and harsh light of adulthood, I somehow find myself wondering what the fuss was about. It has its highlights but never feels like an actual movie, more like a series of golf-themed comic vignettes from the stars of the early Eighties. Speaking of which, I can think of few movies as dated as this one - it is as resolutely Eighties as Mr T, Joan Collins' shoulder pads and Kenny Loggins who (surprise, surprise) pops up on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Welcome to Bushwood Country Club, an exclusive resort with a golf course and spa facilities. Owner Judge Smails (Ted Knight) likes to maintain the club's high standards and is deeply put out when obnoxious new member Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) comes along for a round or two. But Smails has other concerns beside Czervik - a troublesome gopher continues to evade the best efforts of deranged grounds-keeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) while semi-pro Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) tries to teach young caddie Danny (Michael O'Keefe) a few lessons about life and love, possibly involving Smails' flightly niece Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan).<br/><br/>""Caddyshack"" is a frustrating film in many respects. The undoubted highlight is Murray's battle against the gopher which seems to be the only constant throughout the film. For example, I got the feeling from the opening that Danny the caddie would be the film's focus but as the film goes on, I got the feeling that the script lost interest in Danny and focused more on Webb and Czervik. And sadly, the film's fatal flaw lies in its pro- and antagonist - Knight is too stuck up but is nothing like as annoying as Dangerfield who you're supposed to root for, which is something I simply couldn't do. He delivers his lines way too fast and overacts as though its the only thing he knows what to do which I can believe. The true stars are Murray and Chase and personally, they aren't in it enough for me to enjoy the film any more.<br/><br/>I have other issues with it as well - the comedy only really works in fits and starts and the main characters in the plot don't engage you in the same way that Murray and Chase's do. There isn't a real plot line in the movie which also doesn't help things and the humour is mostly childish and toilet-based. It also seems mildly sexist in its treatment of female characters and Dangerfield is a colossal waste of space - lots of people find him funny but I find him about as funny as a famine charity appeal. Maybe I enjoyed as a child because I was a child..."

","CADDYSHACK is yet another movie that everyone else but me has seen until now (apparently). It's directed by Harold Ramis and features Bill Murray and Chevy Chase in their prime, along with Rodney Dangerfield. Why wouldn't it be good? Well, if 90 minutes of improvisation with little to no plot is your idea of good comedy (and considering comedies these days, there are a lot of people who feel that way), then you'll feel right at home. For me, there were a number of individually funny bits from each of the main cast members, but the unfocused, episodic nature of the story kept me from being invested too much in the goings-on at this snooty country club. The best running gag is one that everyone is probably familiar with: Bill Murray and the gopher. But it was only funny in and of itself, feeling mostly tangential to the story (or to justify Bill Murray's presence). There was the potential to do a satire on class conflict, but Rodney Dangerfield threw a wrench in that (most of his bits didn't work for me at all). Chevy Chase got to do some of his shtick as well, but overall it felt like all the cast members were just trying to show each other up instead of being a real ensemble cast. I will say that the soundtrack, heavily featuring Kenny Loggins, was quite good though. Ultimately, I did laugh a handful of times but the script and its execution left a lot to be desired."
"gotoads","2","23","52","3 November 2011"," Caddyshack - a comedy clasSUCK
","I have figured out how this incredibly stupid film became regarded as a comedy ""classic"". In 1980, it had enough stars in it to gather a decent audience. However, it wasn't met with many positive reviews and probably would have faded into obscurity. Magically, this dopey film was perfectly timed to appear uncut on a new format for entertainment - cable TV. Back in the early 80s, HBO would show a handful of movies over and over and over again. Cable choices back them were extremely limited. Caddyshack was played to the saturation point and everybody would talk about it at school. Boys between the ages of 10 and 15, whose sense of humor was understandably shallow and stupid, were incredibly attracted to a film that contained bare boobies, inane bathroom humor and sarcastic quips. Caddyshack had this stuff, plus a mischievous, dancing gopher. Even the kids who hated it back then (like me) had to pretend they liked it for fear of being teased or ostracized by their peers. As time went by, young adults became nostalgic for the film they saw as kids, so they bought this on VHS and later DVD. The majority of people who have watched this in the past decade or two, realize it's complete crap but it brings backs memories of a more youthful, innocent time. Some individuals may legitimately enjoy it but it is clear that they are stoners or former stoners whose brains are completely fried. This is how utter rubbish became ""a classic""."
"Dave-430","3","21","47","7 January 2003"," One of the most overrated comedies of all time
","It is not just that there is no story in this film - lots of comedies have done fine without that - but there are very few real laughs. I think it is incredible that such a meager script could end up getting made. In the 21st century, a film like Caddyshack - or even a comedy a level or two above it - would be painfully dull. The really amazing thing is that two of the finest comedic actors of the time, i.e. Chevy Chase and Bill Murray, fail to save the day. Chevy Chase, however, is a redeeming feature, whereas Rodney Dangerfield is even cornier than usual. I rate it a 3 out of 10."

It features Chevey Chase as an absant minded golf pro, Bill Murray as a perverse greens keeper, Rodney Dangerfield as a rich wise cracking golf and the cutest dancing goffer you will ever see. All three leads are at the top of their game and couldn't be much more funny. There really isn't much of a story here it is pretty much just the viewer follwing around all the different characters and watching their wacky actions unfold. This movie is contains many laugh out loud situations due to our three great leads and even though some of the jokes may miss the target once in a while the film makers keep them coming at a steady pace so that the viewer never gets bored.

"jason-harre","10","4","6","14 May 2003"," Landscaping Changes
","Caddyshack was distinctive in shedding light on the fact that it doesn't take a great script to produce an eminent movie. The film was originally planned out to be more oriented around the youthful character Danny, played by Michael O'Keefe.  Being Harold Ramis' directorial debut it was not shocking to see a slide of importance from the youthful Danny Noonan to his search for a male role-model.  The script claimed O'Keefe to be the main character; however he noticeably took a back seat to the slapstick comedic performances of Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, & Chevy Chase. 	With a cast of this irrepressible quality it was simple to adhere to the demands for improvisation and omitting lines for more comedic séances. O'Keefe's character Danny Noonan was still the essence of the film by bringing out teenage-life issues such as college and poor grades.  At Noonan's age, society and other forces create the need for a decision to be made about his future.  Much like most other teens he had no clue and was searching for guidance.  That guidance came through golfer Ty Webb who played more of a father figure role to Danny.  Comparatively, Danny favored Ty as a role model rather than his own father whom seemed more of a typically oppressive figure.  This was an important tie in with the audience because it is typically how all members of this age range view their parents in middle class suburbia. Even with a drastic changing of the tides with the script, O'Keefe could still be considered the star of the movie due to the fact that his character was the most sought after by the camera.  However, the big name comedians slated on top of him even on the cover-box, leading to a less successful future than at first he had aspired.  After Caddyshack, O'Keefe virtually fell of the face of Hollywood, only making minor appearances in some later blockbuster films such as The Pledge, Ghosts of Mississippi, and The Glass House.  Never having a truly successful independent starring role O'Keefe is still searching over twenty years since his first starring character as Danny Noonan. On the flip side of the spectrum Bill Murray's character became an icon for the picture when at first Carl Spackler was slated to have fewer lines than a sheet of notebook paper.  With Murray's uncanny ability to improve his Spackler took on a whole new dimension.  From the background into the foreground, Spackler became as popularly associated with Caddyshack as Smails, Webb, and Noonan.  As a result, Bill Murray's career outside of Saturday Night Live sky rocketed.  He went on to star in an esteemed list of films such as Stripes, Ghostbusters, What about Bob, Groundhog's Day, Rushmore, and many more.  Noonan's antagonist D'Azunnio was originally scripted as the second leading man.  However with Knight and Dangerfield grabbing attention with their non-stop hilarity he quickly sank into the shadows.  It was obvious that this film was a great success due to the improvisational skills of Knight, Murray, Dangerfield, and Chase. However the toll that was taken was to the careers of O'Keefe and his fellow youthful co-stars.  Personally, I am grateful though because a series of movies starring Bill Murray sound much more appealing than Michael O'Keefe. Then again, I guess we'll never know."

","Caddyshack has some uniquely funny moments.  Carl's (Bill Murray) war with the gopher is hilarious.

Of course those same people tend to deify the incomparably unfunny Adam Sandler and seem to think that loud obnoxious mugging and anal expletives are inherently more humorous than wit, irony, and wordplay. When a dear friend of mine persuaded me to give this dog another chance a few years ago, I reluctantly complied and have regretted it ever since. This film was even more agonizingly unfunny the second time around and ultimately my friend finally had to agree with me. After that experience, I needed a Woody Allen fix bad and had to watch in quick succession ""Play It Again Sam,"" ""Zelig,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" and ""Bullets Over Broadway"" to remove the fecal taste of ""Caddyshack"" from my mouth.

Unfortunately stupidity and childishness are neither illegal nor politically incorrect anywhere in the world, especially not in America.

Caddyshack features an all-star cast of the greatest comedians from the generation that defined comedy films. Rodney Dangerfield was the original prankster and his presence made film extremely enjoyable. Enter veteran actor Ted Knight, who was known for his work as the character Ted Baxter in the Mary Tyler Moore Show.

","Just when self-indulgent, intensely clever, but rather meaningless comedy--supplemented by pot and a rather self-indulgent lifestyle--was beginning to loom large in my tastes (Harold and Kumar, The Office, Trailer Park Boys), along comes Caddyshack and to shatter all of that.<br/><br/>This just might be my pick for the greatest comedy ever made. It's certainly in the Pantheon, along with such greats as Duck Soup, Annie Hall and, perhaps, Harold and Kumar.<br/><br/>Here are the things I love about this film: 1. The allegory for the class system in the US. The setting (a golf course) is ideal for this theme. Unlike in the pathetic flop Happy Gilmore, Caddyshack is as much about the workers who maintain the grounds, and the gulf that separates them from the golfers (who include judges, priests, and businessmen). The caddies are the working class. Some struggle to get out of their predicament, but we're made to understand how hard it is for them. In a brilliant opening dialogue, the caddy hero Danny Noonan says, resignedly, that college costs $8,000/year, that he can't afford it, and that he'll probably end up working in the lumber yard. Chevy Chase's character, for whom Noonan is caddying, responds, ""I own two lumber yards"". ""Yeah, I noticed you don't spend too much time there,"" answers Danny. ""I don't know where they are,"" responds Chase, totally blasé. This is the regard the golfers have for the caddies.<br/><br/>Then there's the grounds keeper (Bill Murray) who's recruited by the course owner to kill a gopher (that could spell doom to a golf course--the gopher represents the Vietcong). The grounds keeper is even poorer and less educated than the caddies (like soldiers in the Vietnam war?). There are some excellent scenes of him running through forest looking for the gopher. The scene could virtually be cut out of the film and stuck into Platoon. I liked this technique for spelling out the allegory.<br/><br/>But not only do we have workers, soldiers, Vietcong, and the elite all playing the same role on the golf course as in the larger world off the course; there are all kinds of distinctions within each class: Danny Noonan is ostracized by many caddies for trying to suck up to the golfers. Chase and Dangerfield both play eccentric, liberal capitalists who have to contend with conservative Republicans who can't stand to be around ""Jews, Roman Catholics, or Blacks"". Then there's the division of labor between men and women.<br/><br/>Most importantly, this isn't in the vein of Les Miserables--it doesn't depict the poor as pathetic and as objects of pity. In Caddyshack, we really see the world from the caddies' perspective. We see how hard it is to relate to the rich (and their Harvard-bound sons), to enter their world.<br/><br/>2. The film offers the most idyllic depiction of being 18 I've ever seen. Director Harold Ramis mostly does this through scenes with Danny Noonan and his cute, Scottish girlfriend Maggie and with Noonan facing off against the rival caddy. The scene in which Noonan and his enemy face off in front of the swimming pool offers a stunning depiction of the 18 year-old male body; one of the strongest cases for being gay I've ever seen. He then exploits this beauty to make us dread the oncoming fight: we don't want them to hurt each other for the same reasons we want to preserve the Great Pyramids of Gizah. Ramis exploits this brilliantly by juxtaposing the youthful beauty with intimations that the fight will be brutal and unrestrained.<br/><br/>Maggie is ""plain"" as compared to the blonde who walks around the course braless. But the sexual scene with her and Danny is far hotter, than those involving the same blonde. And Maggie comes out of that scene the more attractive of the two. Isn't this the way it goes? We think we're attracted to very conventional beauty, but we inevitably realize it's overrated.<br/><br/>3. The musical scenes (the workers' uprising at the pool, Dangerfield driving the yacht) are beautifully choreographed and the music is excellent. In fact, I'd totally listen to the soundtrack.<br/><br/>4. A lot of the jokes are hilarious. Chevy Chase's are my favorite and Bill Murray's good too. Don't be fooled, though. On the surface, Murray's monologues and Dangerfield's one-liners are the meat of the film. In fact, they're only the icing on the cake."

","It's difficult calling anything the ""best"" of that genre or category, but this isn't hard at all. Just as ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather, Part II"" were the two greatest motion pictures of all-time, ""Caddyshack"" is easily the greatest comedy of all-time. With a classic hilarious ensemble cast that included unforgettable performances by the likes of Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield & Ted Knight, most at the peak of their performing careers, and with incredible leadership and writing from top notch guys like Harold Ramis and Brian Doyle-Murray, you gotta go with The Shack. Now a quarter century old, the film still holds up with it's classic ""slobs vs. snobs"" conflict. The depth and delivery of the one-liners here has never been equaled on film. The great stand-alone scenes are too numerous to mention all of them, but include: - Murray as Carl the Groundskeeper, whacking the flower bed as he fantasized about winning the Masters - Dangerfield prancing into the pro shop with his Asian buddy, and telling him that the club is restricted, so ""don't mention you're Jewish"" - Chase ""playing through"" Murray's pad, and their sharing a joint, a ""cannonball"", and tremendous comedic timing - Dangerfield in the club restaurant, introducing himself around Knight's table, then taking over the dance floor as he flips a huge wad of cash to the band; ""Hey, Ringo, you and the boys take some lessons"" - Murray caddying for the priest near the end; ""The good Lord would never interrupt the best game of my life!"" as thunderstorms blast all around them<br/><br/>It just goes on and on and on.....<br/><br/>""And that's all she wrote!"""

","In writing this review, I am not going to attempt to draft out a lengthy summary outlining the pro's and cons of this film. I'm also not going to talk about plot structure or the boundaries of character development. Furthermore, I'm not going to analyze the social ramifications of this flick, or discuss it's effect on society. An achievement such as this, does not require that much thought or labor. Anyone who would try to do so, is a moron (And most likely a fan of those crap-filled ""Lord of the Ring"" movies). Instead, I'm going to state this single opinion, in the simplest possible terms: ""Caddyshack"" is not the greatest film ever. Heck, it's not even my favorite (""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""). But, when speaking of features in the comedic genre of film, it is without a doubt, an undebatable fact, that ""Caddyshack"", is the funniest of all time! Many women will argue that point (my girlfriend being one of the them), and that's quite all right. Because ""Caddyshack"" isn't designed to appeal to an estrogen-ladened mind. Any guy, however, who decides to ridicule ""Caddyshack"", needs to immediately check his equipment, to make sure that's it's still intact, as ""Caddyshack"" is truly the ultimate guy movie, suitable for exposition at any function where alcohol is being consumed.

","Although not a major box-office draw in 1980, ""Caddyshack"" is now ranked as one of the funniest sports movies ever made via magazine polls (it also has Tiger Woods' endorsement to boot), and yet it's full of withered fratboy humor, with a loosely-hinged, character-driven plot that could be summed up as ""the slobs verses the snobs."" Cocky young caddy at the Bushwood Country Club gets in with the nouveau riche swells in hopes of gaining a college scholarship, but soon rebels against the blowhard boors once he's invited to participate in a winners-take-all team golf match. The main narrative, littered with useless supporting characters and a few naked babes, is so thin (and derivative besides, mostly from TV shows such as ""Saturday Night Live"") that it has to rely on a troublesome animatronic gopher to raise audience good will. Debuting director Harold Ramis (who also worked on the screenplay) doesn't have the snappy timing of, say, a John Landis (even as he hopes to ape ""Animal House"" and its ilk). The movie feels cramped and cheap, with pothead-slow pacing and various episodes that aren't shaped and don't fit together. Since humor is entirely personal--what one viewer groans at may make hundreds of others roar with laughter--there's nothing left to respond to except the merits of the production (which is sloppy) and the comedians who make up most of the cast. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray (as an unhinged groundskeeper), Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield are each disappointing; relying on shtick and blobby improvisation, they're just winging it. Chase, in particular, seems super-imposed on the action through some technological shortcut; he's smug, not self-assured, and has all the personality of a man acting in front of a mirror. As the randy caddy, Michael O'Keefe must have relished this comedic opportunity to lighten up from his role as Robert Duvall's son in 1979's ""The Great Santini""; his callow youthfulness, messy crop of blonde hair and deadpan sanity help him stand out from his hammy elders, but he's like Tim Matheson in ""Animal House"": the decent kid on the make, eager to be corrupted. We're supposed to cheer his corruption and take delight in the sight of the rube sticking it to the man, while Murray plants and sets off explosives during the golf match and nobody takes notice of him. Ramis has too many golf balls in the air--and they all come down unceremoniously. * from ****"

","Caddyshack is without a doubt a big classic. It still holds up nearly 40 years later, has a very awesome cast, the comedy is brilliant, and has a very good working story.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is about a teen, Danny (played by Michael O'Keefe) that works as a caddy at a country club to raise money for his college education. He decides to caddy for a club member, Judge Eilhu Smalls (played by Ted Knight) and gets advice and help from a wealthy golfer Ty (played by Chevy Chase) in order to win the upcoming Caddy Day golf tournament before a rude millionaire, Al (played by Rodney Dangerfield), wants to purchase the country club.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there is a pesky gopher going around the golf course and creating havoc. The club's groundskeeper, Carl (played by Bill Murray) is given the task to take out the rodent and just so happens that the gopher is smarter than he thinks.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is a great film. The cast is top notch. You got great comedians like Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, and Chevy Chase together and they were all pretty funny. Ted Knight may not of been a comedian, but he still did a great job. I think the best parts of the film were with the gopher. It just has that classic slapstick humor that many people were used to back then, and even though this film is rated R, the gopher scenes are the only scenes that both kids and adults can watch and laugh at, but the rest is all fun for adults.<br/><br/>The story was also straight forward and basic. Not confusing at all, and the pacing went in a great pace.<br/><br/>Overall, Caddyshack is hands down a big classic that never gets old."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","5","24 October 2006"," A comedy without a point and or even plot...what is there not to love?!
","This is a typical silly comedy from the early '80's. The movie is basically filled with numerous humorous situations and crazy characters, without ever really making an attempt to make things click to each other in the movie or letting it make sense. Sounds like an awfully simple and lame comedy and it's its core it actually of course is. Yet the movie works perfectly thanks to the superb comedy cast, who all are in great form. <br/><br/>Basically the movie follows three main plot lines, set on and around a golf course. First there is the caddy Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) who tries to get a scholarship and deals with girl problems, among other things. Then there is Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) who has to hunt and kill a gopher that is ruining the green. And then there's the plot with Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight) and Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), who are constantly battling each other, on and off the golf course. But in all fairness, those plot lines are just an excuse to introduce many eccentric characters and letting them do many crazy things. There actually are many subplots in the movie but this movie is all about its characters and comical situations.<br/><br/>It's obvious that they improvised a lot during this movie, with its characters, situations and dialog. Even if there was a complete script, it was abandoned multiple times throughout the movie. It's sort of part of the charm of ""Caddyshack"". Of course as always, especially Bill Murray does great in the improvised sequences.<br/><br/>The story often doesn't really make sense and it doesn't even try to do so. The movie is filled with totally pointless sequences that are only put in for the laughs, not for the story or the flow of it. Best example of this is the ""Jaws"" spoof sequence. The same goes for most of the characters. The movie doesn't try to make sense, so the gloves are of and there is no holding back. It provides the movie with some absolutely priceless humor and dialog at times. <br/><br/>The humor is totally crazy. It's over-the-top and at times also quite vulgar. Guess you have to appreciate the lame mindless and pointless humor of '70's and '80's movie to fully enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>The characters are really the reason why this comedy works as such an highly amusing and funny one. All of the characters are eccentric to put it mildly. It definitely helps that most of the characters are being played by very talented comedy actors. Normally I'm not a big Chevy Chase fan but in this movie he was just perfect. Bill Murray is crazy as always and perhaps in this movie even crazier than all of the other characters in this movie combined. Really amusing was also Rodney Dangerfield in a totally crazy and over-the-top role, with some great comical dialog from his character. He provides some of the biggest laughs of the movie.<br/><br/>A comedy that I just never grow tired of.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Just finished watching this movie with my 16 year son, who was skeptical about it after seeing modern day screwball comedies like ""Old School."" He loved it.<br/><br/>Unlike at least one other reviewer, I thought Chevy Chase was great through-out the movie. With all the over the top comedy through-out the movie, it's easy to miss Chevy with Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield's over the top performances. Chevy clearly has some of the best lines, delivered so off-the-cuff as to be easily missed.<br/><br/>Bill Murray may be at his comedic best in this movie playing underplaying an over-the-top character with great effect. He's so funny, it's easy to spend your time watching this movie in eager anticipation of when he'll again be on screen.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield is classic Rodney Dangerfield in a part that had to be written just for him. Much of his schtick is just as tired as Rodney looks, but all is delivered with his usual ""I've got a squirrel in my pants"" style. If you're a fan of Rodney, there's lots to like about him in the movie. If you hate him, though, be warned: his screen time will wear on you like nails on a chalkboard.<br/><br/>Ted Knight in a pseudo-Ted Baxter performance fits his role perfectly. If you grew up watching him on the Mary Tyler Moore show, you'll get more of the same.<br/><br/>Michael O'Keefe and Tony D'Annunzio play good counterpoints to each other in underdeveloped, but clichÃ©d roles of ""average nice guy"" and ""hip, cool guy"" to Cindy Morgan's smokin' hot chick. (She is gorgeous!) Sarah Holcomb's Irish looks and accent are a joy. Too bad this was her last film.<br/><br/>Plenty of great characters with at least six or more mixed up plot lines held loosely together by the golfing theme and intersecting liberally. The setting automatically excuses most of the dating of the movie. Hey, everyone knows golfers have no fashion sense."

This film works for many reasons: The cast is a strange mixture, but each cast member is riot. Many say Bill Murray steals the show, and it is hard to dispute, but Murray was pretty new to the movies then, and so was Rodney Dangerfield. Bill was hot from Saturday Night Live and Rodney was still primarily still doing stand up. Ted Knight was famous from the Mary Tuler Moore Show, but not really known for feature films. Chevy Chase, in my opinion, was a supporting player, as was Michael O'Keefe, and Sarah Holcomb. This was Harold Ramis' first time as director, and he really delivered. Ramis also had a writing credit,and he was really on a roll at that time....ANIMAL HOUSE in 1978, CADDYSHACK in 1980, STRIPES in 1981, and GHOST BUSTERS in 1984. These four films are among the best comedies Hollywood offered in the 1970s and 80s! I recently saw Ramis discuss this film and he remarked how difficult it would normally be to direct 4 such strong comedians in same film, but he also remarked how great each was, and how professional they were."

","The 1980s saw some okay music, the advent of computers into the home was really taking off, and the science fiction genre (riding off the coat tails of Star Wars) was really making a comeback in feature films.<br/><br/>But not everything from the 80s is golden, as I mentioned in some previous reviews. And Caddyshack is one of them.<br/><br/>Simply put I don't get this film. I really don't. Bill Murry has a kind of Ahab-like obsession with a rodent chewing up his workplace home turf, and there's some thing about a gold contest and an examination of snobbery. <br/><br/>Bill Murry acting like a drugged out gardener is not funny. It simply is not funny. I don't know why people (mostly men) heap praises on it, but it is not funny in the least. Or, rather it could be but you would have had to have shaved off several IQ points from your personal intelligence quotient.<br/><br/>And I can't make it any plainer than that.<br/><br/>This is one of those few rare occasions where the sequel is funnier, and given that this film is worthy of a smirk or two at best, that's not high praise.<br/><br/>If you like idiotic humor, then maybe check out this film, but don't say I didn't warn you.<br/><br/>Watch at your peril."

","'Caddyshack' is one of those films that many people seem to really love. Yes, it has a few funny moments and a few funny scenarios, but there really is not that much more to it. I personally found the film to be annoying. (The most memorable was the gopher incident, and this is probably a running - err, digging - joke among those who enjoy their games of golf.) <br/><br/>I don't think this film is for everyone. I mean, I certainly did not enjoy it. Then again, I have never played golf in my life; I don't watch it on television either. If you enjoy golf, you will probably enjoy some of the jokes in this film, but it is not for everyone and the humor is not for everyone."
"lathe-of-heaven","6","2","3","14 December 2013"," Funny in places; enjoyable, but in my lowly & wretched opinion way, WAY overrated... Blu-ray: Very Good (especially for it's age) A:8 V:9
","Well, I FINALLY saw this just now (I know, you look at the date here and likely cannot believe it) I've always heard what a Comedy classic this is and I just now had the opportunity to see the Blu-ray.<br/><br/>I will say that for a modestly budgeted film made in 1980, the Blu-ray is just about one of THE best looking I've ever seen. I was REALLY amazed that they were able to squeeze out this kind of picture quality from a film like this, especially when other, higher cost films from the same era do not look any where near this good.<br/><br/>Now, about the film. I don't know... Just being honest, I truly do not see quite what makes this film such a TOTAL classic like people say. There is one reviewer here who states that this is one of the TOP 5 Comedy films of all time. Really...? I mean, don't get me wrong, there are a number of set pieces that are indeed pretty funny. The scene where Bill Murray and Chevy Chase are together is pretty good; and for the most part, I thought Chevy's delivery was the funniest with his low-key chic, goofy style. BUT... and it is a frigg'n HUGE BUT like Mariah Carey's... for the most part, I really thought that the humour and performances were just silly and I truly felt that if the writing had been a LOT better, THEN, MAYBE this could have been closer to a classic. But, for example, I LOVE Rodney Dangerfield, and he was his usual lovable self in his performance and bearing. BUT... again... I felt quite honestly that his lines were simply ATROCIOUS! That same reviewer who I mentioned before also said that Rodney's lines, for example like right after he farted and said, 'Who stepped on a duck', were just rolling in the aisles hilarious. Uh, okay... I mean, come on... his lines like when all the old people are dancing at the club, 'Hey, the cemetery is just around the corner' and 'I've never seen dead people smoking'... Uh... does that sound like the height of hilarity to you...?<br/><br/>I truly do NOT mean to diss this EXTREMELY well loved film, I don't; and, all in all I enjoyed it I think mainly because it was sort of tied together with some funny parts. But like ALL of Ted Knight's lines and delivery were completely forced, plastic and stupid sounding (rest his soul...) and other things similar to this in my unworthy opinion really took away from the funniness of the film. BUT... there were some good bits and funny situations; and the gopher addition was pretty funny in a simple kind of way.<br/><br/>In trying to understand this, I think of films that I MYSELF find far, FAR funnier, I mean, ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE funnier, and I just don't understand it. Okay, pretty much here we are talking about simple, low-brow, but not overly crude humour. To me, ALL of the 'NAKED GUN' films and Geez, MOST of Mel brooks' and the MARX Brothers' films are frigg'n LIGHT YEARS funnier than this. These films that I mention here are REALLY silly too, but in my lowly estimation the silliness is usually quite clever or the situations and characters come across a LOT funnier. Here with this film, I never really felt that ANYTHING was particularly 'clever' at all... And, to me, none of the characters, with the exception of Chevy Chase, and to SOME extent, Bill Murray, were all that likable or engaging (I DID think though that Bill Murray's ad-libbed scene about getting all horny and worked up over the old lady golfers was hilarious!) Again, an excellent example of one of the many ISOLATED bits that were indeed very funny in this film.<br/><br/>I don't know; maybe I'm just over-thinking it and I should just sit back and enjoy it for what it is. But, to me anyway, I THINK it was just basically the writing and dialog that drastically diminished the quality of the comedy overall. Like I mentioned, IF for example, Rodney's lines had been the USUAL GREAT Rodney lines, then fine. I mean, he was bloody AWESOME in 'BACK TO SCHOOL'. But the writing and intelligence behind that film to me were of HUGELY better quality.<br/><br/>Anyway, I just thought I would drop my honest thoughts here amongst the raving reviews. I KNOW that Comedy, like Horror, and many other art forms is HIGHLY subjective and apparently MANY people DO find this film one of the funniest ever. So, I would say that if you like your Comedy rather simple, but fun and silly, then you probably will like it. BUT... if you are like me where you really want at least some level of cleverness in the writing and the characters, then you may find this movie a little bit wanting..."

","Following the success of ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" a couple of years earlier Harold Ramis and Doug Kenney struck comedy gold a second time with this classic that once again pitted the slobs against the snobs.<br/><br/>The cast is dynamite. Chevy Chase was at the top of his game as zen golfer Ty Webb, Bill Murray was equally memorable as demented assistant greens-keeper Carl Spackler, the one and only Rodney Dangerfield basically played himself with predictably hilarious results and rounding it out was Ted Knight, who effortlessly oozed smarm.<br/><br/>The storyline is rambling but that doesn't matter much. It's the jokes and the interplay between the actors that fuels the movie. It was no surprise to learn that there was a lot of improvisation going on on the set. The sole scene shared by Chevy Chase & Bill Murray is sheer genius through and through. Still, a more coherent story would have benefited the film.<br/><br/>There is one thing I'm not crazy about, though, and that is the music. 'Songs by Kenny Loggins' doesn't have the same ring today as it did about thirty years ago. That being said, ""I'm Alright"" isn't bad. I do wish, however, that the filmmakers had gotten Elmer Bernstein to handle the music like he did for ""Animal House"".<br/><br/>In the end, I give the all-around edge to the precursor, ""Animal House"", but this one is a worthy successor. Too bad Doug Kenney didn't live to see the end of the year or we might have seen more comedies of this caliber during the '80s."
"wayofthecass","7","2","3","12 October 2007"," A very funny summer golf comedy.
","The film has some great moments and is possibly one of the most ad-libbed pictures of all time. Chevy Chase, in one of his first film roles, gives us a taste of his great comic turn in 'Fletch'(1985) with the off-beat portrayal of club pro Tye Webb. Chase is really untouchable when it comes to playing funny-straight characters. Bill Murray is hilarious as grounds keeper Carl Spackler. Murray has improvised just about all of his dialogue and it really is superb. His 'Cinderella Story' scene, followed by caddying for the Bishop in the thunder storm is one of the funniest things i've seen on screen.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield is somewhat hit and miss. All of his dialogue is quick fire one-liners so the chances are that when he does crack a funny joke you'll be so busy laughing that you'll miss the next one. The funniest one in my book is his retort to caddy Tony D'Annunzio: 'Hey kid, when are you due back in boy's town?' For me Ted Knight steals the picture as Judge Smails. He is such an energetic over the top character. His constant put downs of grandson Spallding , 'You'll get nothing and like it!', and random acts of frustrated violence supplied constant entertainment.<br/><br/>The question is...why didn't the film just focus completely on these guys? Instead it kept on harping back to Danny Noonan. Michael O'Keefe is a fine actor but he was always going to struggle in a comedy which featured the above cast members and characters. Another handicap is that in a comedy he gets few comedic lines. His character's relationship with his girlfriend Maggie, played inexplicably with a terrible Irish accent, and with his own family are highly under developed. Cindy Morgan is also given an extremely under written character who's motives are never explained and who randomly comes in and out of the film. Harold Ramis's direction is at times sloppy and echoes his then inexperience. He did go on to do 'Groundhog Day'(1993) though so he obviously learned his lessons.<br/><br/>To sum up this is a good film to get you in the mood for the summer. Lots of beautiful weather covering some splendid golf course scenery. There are plenty of likable characters and some very funny set pieces. Its also interesting to see the launch pad for some of the 80s biggest comedic stars. But be warned if you don't like Chase, Murray or Dangerfield then don't waste your time on this. Along with Knight, the film really is their show. For further evidence to support the final sentence just look at the poster."

","Get that critter off the course & make room for a great comedy. This film has it all- from Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, & Rodney Dangerfield all providing great performances to Ted Knight in his best movie role as a straight man to Rodney. While this film has developed some political correctness problems now due to some R rated materials which are not as acceptable today as they were in 1980, the film & it's players rise above that to a great comedy level. <br/><br/>I only wish Ted Knight& Rodney Dangerfield could have teamed up some more in their careers. While Chase & Murray are great in this film, it is these Ted & Rodney playing off each other that puts this film over the top on entertainment value. There is plenty of verbal & visual comedy in this film which makes it great too. It plays off several themes & comes off as a great time. The reason I say Ted & Rodney are the glue is that if you watch the sequel, CADDYSHACK 2 with Jackie Mason & Robert Stack trying to do Ted & Rodney's roles & compare it with this original, you will find while the second one failed where this one succeeded. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is good but the music is more for rock fans. The main weakness in this original is the love story between the young folks which is a throwback to this type of story distraction in MARX BROTHERS films. Luckily, this film never stops for too long on this subplot. Just remember the folks in this cast & some great classic comedy are what you watching this film for. Jon Peters (Babs Streisands ex husband & hair dresser) produced this one."

","This movie is a classic. Not a perfect movie but it's a classic. A classic is a classic and this one is a classic. Okay I said the word classic enough, now to the point. Two actors in this film are often overlooked, but in fact they are the base of the film. One is Michael O Keefe, who is to this movie was Tim Matheson is to ""Animal House"", that is, he's the true star. Everything centers on him, he's likable and flows well with the ""good"" and the ""bad"" guys. Another overlooked genius is Ted Knight as Judge Smails. Ted plays the uptight villain with energy and you love to hate him and hate to love him. I can't stand comedies where they make the ""jerk"" a really unlikeable guy. John Vernon from ""Animal House"" was likable and was really fun to watch. Ted McKinley in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" was too. But there are some comedies where the bad guys are just bad people and it's no fun hating them. Anyhow, this review is just to point out this fact: that Rodney, Chevy and Bill are superb, but Michael and Ted are the base holding these bricks together. Scott Colomby, as the ""villian"" of the caddies, a cross between Matt Dillon and Scott Baio, is also quite good... And least I forget Spaudling, the best character in the film... possibly one of the best characters in movie history!"

","Yes, it's a funny movie. No, it doesn't age well. That's not to say it's unfunny over 20 years later, it's just a very different film with all of the actors either off the radar or making different types of movies entirely.<br/><br/>The movie is basically a hastily thrown together script featuring improvisations from Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray, surrounded by actual professional actors doing their best to hold the scenes together. Cindy Morgan is beautiful, Michale O'Keefe is charismatic, and neither of them were ever (well, almost never) heard from again.<br/><br/>Fun to watch the most popular comedic actors of the 1980's do their thing, but all these years later the bad edits really stand out, the low-budget sticks up, and Harold Ramis shows he's not quite up to the task of directing a real movie. For a fake one, though, this is pretty good. 8/10."

","When one would look for the comedic geniuses of the 1970s and 80s, almost all of them show up in Caddyshack. The combination of SNL players and established comedic stars produces one of the funniest movies of that generation. Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield highlight the stars of this film, which also boasts fine performances from the supporting players, notably Michael O'Keefe. A caddy who cannot pay for college himself, O'Keefe, aligns himself with the corrupt judge, Knight, to win the Caddy Scholarship. That's pretty much the plot. In between are wonderful performances by the rest of the cast, each playing an individual character that are annoying on their own, but seem to fit in at Bushwood Country Club. There are classic scenes, especially for anyone who has ever played golf. From a Bishop being struck by lightning while playing his best ever round, to ""Na-na-na-na,"" to a misplaced Baby Ruth bar, and of course the gopher that inhabits the course. Bill Murray is the hapless course maintenance man who's job it is to take down the gopher, when he's not winning the Masters, a ""true Cinderalla story."" The sheer talent in this movie is why it is a comedy classic."

First saw this movie on a network TV showing in 1982 or 1983 and watched it countless times.  Only recently (1994) did I finally see it uncut and the stuff I didn't know about just made the film greater.

","If ANIMAL HOUSE was on a golf course this is what you would get. Harold Ramis directs and co-wrote with Douglas Kenney and Brian Doyle-Murray (who both had acting parts as well) one of the greatest sports films of all time. Now, I admit there really isn't much of a plot going on, but tons of laughs and that is a main ingredient to a comedy.<br/><br/>Chevy Chase plays one of his strangest, but also one of his best characters in golfing great Ty Webb. Love his golfing practice where he states the be the ball line ""NA NA NA NA"" while putting balls into the hole. Ted Knight plays uptight and snooty Judge Smails and Rodney Dangerfield plays rich slob Al Czervik. Together they have great scenes where they have an ongoing feud. Bill Murray plays crazy, lame-brained assistant groundskeeper Carl Spackler. Finally, Michael O'Keefe plays Danny Noonan who is a caddy at Bushwood and looking to win the caddy tournament and perhaps get help financially with his college education.<br/><br/>This film really has some great classic comic scenes like when the caddies go to the Bushwood pool, the christening of the Flying Wasp and The Bishop (Henry Wilcoxon) having the game of his life with Murray as his caddy. Not to mention the ongoing scenes of Murray trying to kill the gopher that is destroying the golf course.<br/><br/>Really a must see for those who enjoy classic comedies. Hilarious and totally influential to me. The four main comic leads in Chase, Dangerfield, Knight and Murray are in top form."
"tdrish","7","1","1","2 December 2019"," Cup runneth over with laughs
","It should be illegal to make movies this funny. Packed and overflowing at the seams with jokes, quotes, and laughs, Caddyshack doesn't really have any room for a story. People slam Caddyshack II for having virtually no story line, but to be very truthful, neither does this one. The difference is, this movie sets the bar very high for what it is: an over the top, goofy comedy. When you take all the humor out of the movie, all your left with is the husk of a strange, weird film. The movie strategies itself into a jam packed laugh fest. If you go three minutes without laughing, something is wrong. Rodney Dangerfield alone, all he has to do is open his mouth, and I'm already laughing. ""If I kill all the golfers on the golf course, wouldn't that be illegal?"" ""Gophers, you idiot! Not golfers!"" I'm cracking myself up here. There's the famous pool scene with the Baby Ruth floating around. Caddyshack is your pick! It will not ruin your evening, trust me."

"Tweekums","8","1","1","2 October 2019"," Classic Country Club Comedy
","This classic from 1980 is set an exclusive country club where teenager Danny Noonan is working as a caddy to earn money to pay to go to college. Other key characters are the snobbish Judge Elihu Smails, coarse property developer Al Czervik, zen-like golf pro Ty Webb and Carl Spackler the groundskeeper who is waging war against a gopher! During the course of the film we are treated to comedy antics on the golf course, in the club house and at the local marina before a finale that features an explosive grudge match that goes to the eighteenth hole.<br/><br/>While some have this films gags haven't aged too well it doesn't matter too much as they come thick and fast. The jokes are a more than a little crude at times but it is hard not to laugh. The cast includes several comedy stars of the time. Bill Murray is probably the most memorable as the unhinged Spackler, his increasingly extreme attempts to kill a gopher are hilarious; Rodney Dangerfield turns it up to eleven as the truly obnoxious Czervik; Ted Knight is impressive as the bigoted judge and Chevy Chase is solid if less memorable as Ty Webb. The rest of the cast is solid enough. Given when it was made it is no surprise that there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and the special effects certainly show their age. The gopher is so obviously fake it either adds to the comedy or is silly depending on one's opinion... I'm inclined to the latter. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy late '70s/early '80s comedy you need to watch it at least once."
"tavm","9","1","1","29 June 2010"," Caddyshack was a fine showcase for Chase, Murray, Knight, and Dangerfield
","So after watching Animal House and Meatballs again after so many years, I decided to rewatch this third consecutive movie co-written by Harold Ramis of which this time he also directed. I'm talking, of course, about Caddyshack which is also the third movie I'm reviewing in order that stars a member-or in this case two-of ""Saturday Night Live"". They are Chevy Chase and Bill Murray with the latter stealing many scenes as the groundskeeper who is constantly trying to rid the golf course of a gopher who likes to dance. He also fantasizes about being in the tournament and has dreams about old ladies. There's also a great scene with a bishop played by Henry Wilcoxon as he and Murray play while the rain falls down and music from The Ten Commandments (1956) is heard as the score. (Incidentally, that music not only links Wilcoxon to his previous role in that C. B. DeMille epic but that score's composer, Elmer Bernstein, links him to the previous movies I mentioned at the start of this review.) Anyway, Chase is himself witty whether counseling caddy Danny (Michael O'Keefe) on his golf swing, seducing Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), sharing grass with Murray, or subtly insulting Judge Smails (Ted Knight in an excellent slow burn role). Then there's the lovably obnoxious Rodney Dangerfield with his brash insults that light up every scene he's in. It's hard to believe this was only the second time he's appeared in a feature film as he's a delight throughout especially when pitted against Knight. And besides Ramis, his co-scripter from Animal House-Douglas Kenney, and Brian Doyle-Murray-Bill's brother-contributed many funny scenes and lines. By the way, Doyle-Murray, another SNL alum, also appears as an employer of the country club. And there's one more connection to Animal House: Sarah Holcomb, who was the 13-year-old cashier there, became the Irish-accented waitress who almost got pregnant by Danny here. Perhaps the weakest subplot but at least it got short shrift here. Anyway, while not perfect, Caddyshack is still one of the most hilarious comedies to come out from former SNL players during this era. P.S. I feel honored to mention fellow Chicago natives Harold Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Cindy Morgan, not to mention Brian's brother Bill from nearby Wilmette, in my review. And that animatronic gopher is actually credited as being played by a ""Chuck Rodent""!"

","So Caddyshack is several of the funniest movies ever. It's a half-dozen characters each with their own story (sometimes the stories overlap) occupying the same celluloid. It's really a very interesting narrative strategy. I'd call it avant garde, except it was written by Harold Ramis, therefore making such a statement absurd. It's Chevy Chase's finest hour (so dry he might as well be a desert, his humor so sly you miss half his jokes) and Bill Murray's no slouch either (did he improvise the Cinderella story bit or was it written like that? was his part written at all or was he allowed to be as lewd and retarded as he wanted to be?). Oh, and then there's Rodney, the funniest guy in the film. He walks on, completely in charge of himself and his jokes and completely slays. He's not debonair, like Chase, nor is he, like Murray, a buffoon - he's simply hilarious. (Actually, Murray might be funnier, but Dangerfield is so garish and unreserved that it's fantastic). Caddyshack isn't great, as a whole, but it has tremendously funny characters; it's a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend an evening."

It's still funny.  This is a timeless film that has countless laugh out loud gags mixed together with subtle jokes that you have to watch the film multiple times to really notice.  It's also one of those rare comedies that's humor does not seem the least bit dated even twenty plus years after it was released.

Nobody with any sense of humor can watch this movie the first time, or the tenth time without laughing. It's thoroughly enjoyable entertainment that never grows old. One of my favorite scenes from the movie puts Chase in Murrays' greenskeeper shack. Watch Chase cough and pretend to not want to ""hit"" the joint - but he can't put it down.

The cast, although it was reported that they didn't really get along all the time, makes it work.  We meet Chevy Chase, who combines laughs, sensuality, and his laid-back persona as the Zen-obsessed golfer and ladies' man, Ty Webb, Rodney Dangerfield, who steals the show as loudmouth real-estate developer Al Czervik, Ted Knight as the sharp-tongued Judge Smails, Bill Murray as the demented greenskeeper Carl Spackler on the prowl to hunt for a giant gopher, Michael O'Keefe as Danny Noonan, the caddy with hopes for something better, Sarah Holcomb, who was underused as Danny's Irish waitress girlfriend, Maggie, and Cindy Morgan as the lovely but lascivious blonde bombshell, Lacey Underall, who has flings with Ty and Danny, and gets flirted by all the young men on the golf course and the pool.  The gags are memorable, whether it be a candy bar in the pool mistaken for feces, that scares all the swimmers, or Al's latest gadgets to help him score, not to mention Al's outrageous jokes (""Did somebody step on that duck?"").

","I found Caddyshack to be a movie comprised of great comedic performances. Rodney Dangerfield shines as a big-shot land developer taking in some golf at a snooty country club.  Ted Knight gives an applaudable 'straight man' performance enhancing the timing of the comedians around him.  Bill Murray is classic as the 'assistant grounds-keeper' who is at war with the only real setback of the film, the childish but low-key Mr. Gopher.

"sddavis63","2","6","15","7 January 2009"," Mark Twain's Line About Golf Works Here
","Jon Peters - the executive producer of Caddyshack - said that ""golfers love this movie."" I can't argue that point for a moment. My father-in-law is a golfer and he loves this movie, and loaned us the DVD to watch it. Unfortunately, I am not a golfer. I lean to the Mark Twain school of thought on the game - ""golf is a nice walk ruined."" Needless to say, I did not love this movie.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about it is that Rodney Dangerfield is only part of an ensemble cast rather than the actual star. That meant that his typical crude, buffoonish character didn't have as much time to grate on me as in some of the movies he's actually starred in (think ""My 5 Wives."") In the time he was on screen he still grated as real estate developer Al Czervik. Three primary subplots very loosely held together what there was of a story here - groundskeeper Carl's (Bill Murray) attempts to dispose of a pesky gopher who's tearing up the greens (the fake gopher also grated on me); caddy Danny's (Michael O'Keefe) attempts to suck up to Judge Smails (Ted Knight) in order to gain a scholarship to university (maybe he should have worked harder in high school?) and the bet between Czervik and Smails. Chevy Chase was also included here as a sort of new age golf ace. The cast didn't blow me away. Dangerfield I've commented on. Murray's work was probably the best in an undemanding role and Chase wasn't bad. O'Keefe was OK. Knight seemed to keep falling into his Ted Baxter persona from the Mary Tyler Moore show. Thinking back to Mark Twain - this movie was a potentially nice 99 minutes ruined! And to think this spawned a sequel! Obviously there are a lot of golfers getting too much sun! 2/10"
"Anonymous_Maxine","5","6","15","13 January 2005"," Get drunk first.
","There are several classic comedies that, at the time of this writing, I've never seen, like Animal House, Groundhog Day, and, until yesterday, Caddyshack. Maybe I just expected more, but I found Caddyshack to be pretty disappointing. The only funny people in the movie are Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield, and the latter only sporadically. Rodney Dangerfield has this style of comedy that is brilliant in stand-up, but in a film it is not very conducive to repeat viewings. His style is too spontaneous to be funny more than once or twice, but was still funnier in this movie by leaps and bounds than Bill Murray, who turned in an astonishingly unamusing performance.<br/><br/>A lot of times I find myself unable to sufficiently appreciate these goofball comedies, because when they reach the level of cult classic that this movie has, I really expect them to be side-splittingly hilarious, which Caddyshack simply is not. On the other hand, I think my sense of humor has matured beyond the ability to fully appreciate the crude humor for which 80s comedies are often so well known, so maybe I'm wrong (note: I'm not wrong).<br/><br/>Structurally, the movie is very well made. When it ultimately gets around to the real conflict in the movie rather than concentrating on the stupid clash between the drunken teen caddies and the snooty rich folk that populate the curiously named Bushwood Country Club, there is some genuine tension created. Bill Murray plays a groundskeeper caricature (replacing groundskeeper Willie, who showed up in the beginning of the movie and then promptly and inexplicably disappeared completely) who is assigned by the club's owner to get rid of the gophers that have somehow made it onto the golf course and proceeded to tear huge ruts into the putting greens. Murray's role for the rest of the movie is to plot huge military vengeance against the offending gopher, who really only wants to listen to good music and get his groove on. I'm not sure whose talent is more wasted, Murray's or the gopher's.<br/><br/>I've found recently that watching any documentaries provided with the DVDs almost invariably makes me appreciate the movie more. I liked this movie much more after I watched the cast and crew talking about their experiences in making it, much as my appreciation was lifted by similar documentaries for movies like Willard and Texas Chainsaw III, which had nowhere to go but up anyway.<br/><br/>What I can't get over, though, is how funny Caddyshack is not. It's not that the comedy flew below my radar, so to speak, but that there is really not much effort put into making it funny. If the making-of documentary is to be believed (although I have a feeling that this was said as a joke), the screenplay was originally intended to be a drama, but not much of what was in the script ever made it into the final film. If that's true, my theory is that it was the dancing mechanical gopher that turned it from a drama into a comedy. Whatever the case, Caddyshack turned out to be one of the most famous comedies ever made, although in my opinion, not even close to one of the best."
"johnnyboyz","6","3","6","19 January 2006"," A charming little sports comedy
","It's a shame that the genre of sport when it comes to film isn't as exploited as much as it perhaps should be. Often, the clichés can come thick and fast when it comes to narrative and the characters involved; such as 'the underdog' and the 'underdog always winning in the end', so after seeing this, it was pleasing to see a film that steered clear of this and took a completely different direction when approaching the genre.<br/><br/>The multi-strand storyline is cute to say the least. On one side, you've got the tension building up between an elderly golfer and a new member of the club who is a lot richer and a lot louder and as a result, is seen as more of a rival than a fellow member. On the other side, you have a rather bizarre yet amusing at times sub-plot involving the unforgettable Bill Murray as an obsessed green keeper attempting to annihilate a pesky gopher terrorising the course. Throw a love story into the mix and you've got a film. The dialogue and acting really flows out of the actors, especially Bill Murray's character in a number of different scenes and on a number of different occasions. Everything from the discovery that it was only, after all, a chocolate bar in the pool to the now famous 'Cinderella Story' monologue.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield's character is another who benefits from the amusing script as he goes around breaking every single rule (not just golf rules) in particularly funny fashion. One scene during an evening dinner/party when he gives his own personal opinion about each guest in a rather outgoing manner is particularly memorable. Chevy Chase's character is also good value as the rather bland but open-minded doctor who can shoot a below par round without caring too much, he also eats off the script which springs to life at clever moments.<br/><br/>On the down side, despite the quaint little narrative, there is never much of a plot. Although this is dominantly a golf/sporting orientated film, there is never really an atmosphere of sports nor is there much tension as the opposing sides in the form of the rich old men at the club attempts to build up. The reason behind this is that with Bill Murray's characters sub-plot inter-cutting now and again, the comic relief distinguishes any atmosphere we might previously have felt.<br/><br/>The film also seems to hover around on young caddie 'Danny' as he deals with life at the golf club and seems forever chasing his own personal 'American Dream' which, although when compared to all the other characters' aims is a lot more long term, it just seems to weigh the film down in a rather strange way as any scene with Danny, you feel isn't particularly important as the real stories/comic interest are lying with most of the characters. This slows the film down slightly but there is enough of everything else to keep it interesting until the final match, which actually seems quite tame itself until the little twist you eventually see building up during the game.<br/><br/>I think you'll enjoy this film in places and depending on your mood whilst you watch this, there's a high chance you'll like it overall."

If you're into modern comedy and thought Ghostbusters was OK (btw, for the record, I love GBs) you might as well just forget you even heard of Caddyshack.<br/><br/>The film has no identifiable lead role, discomfortingly swapping stations between dryish Chevy Chase and very dry Bill Murray, who between them hog all the decent lines - few though they are - offencive loudmouth Rodney Dangerfield, stuck up Ted Knight and typical teenager Michael O'Keefe. Who's story is this film telling?<br/><br/>It isn't long before the film becomes predictable with Knight stating gambling is illegal and Chase saying he doesn't gamble for money.

But unlike today's dumb comedies, Caddyshack unfortunately has absolutely NO story and it's basically just a series of thrown-together vignettes that, by 1980 standards, were probably pretty funny, but if you compare the movie to today's dumb comedies, they don't measure up.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some funny moments, but there's just nothing that holds your interest for very long and there's definitely no storyline that runs from beginning to end.

","I recently watched Caddyshack for the first time in years. I loved it years ago and still quote it today. Before viewing, I told my brother I was gonna rent it. After all, I hadn't seen it since college. He said ""dude, this movie hasn't aged well."" I retorted with a quick ""you're crazy."" This is Caddyshack, one of THE all time great comedies. A modern day comedic masterpiece according to everyone, including myself. In a past review about Used Cars, I even marveled about how it's jokes had aged well, whereas UC had lost it's edge.<br/><br/>About an hour into it, I realized ""oh my God, my brother is right."" The film isn't just dated because of the polyester, unkempt hair and short shorts. The jokes simply aren't as funny. Lines that I regularly quote didn't hold up. I can't tell you the disappointment I experienced in learning this. First of all, I'm a huge fan of Rodney Dangerfield. And some of his lines are quotable, even from this movie. But many of his antics simply haven't held up. Other Dangerfiled films like Back to School have aged much better. Then again, I haven't watched it in a few years, maybe it's lost it's humor. It did have William Zabka, the poster child of 80s blond haired goons. So who knows.<br/><br/>I never cared about the plot of this movie. Neither did Harold Ramis. It's basically about the vastly different members at a country club. It's character driven, not plot based, and gag ridden. And some of the jokes are fun to quote with friends. But hearing them during the movie will not make you laugh. Even on DVD, the film just hasn't aged well. It really feels low budget.<br/><br/>I don't want to get in depth about this movie. Nearly everyone on earth has seen it. The writing is good, Harold Ramis knew what he was doing. And watching it, I could see the similarities with this and Animal House. Ramis didn't direct AH but the music in each was similar. And each movie really had no plot. But whereas Animal House still gets the party going, Caddyshack seems hopelessly antiquated. Seriously, picking your boogers and eating em? The Baby Ruth in a swimming pool? That was funny when everyone was saying ""sike.""<br/><br/>Having said that, there's no denying Caddyshacks place in film history. It showed the screen talent of Dangerfield to a new generation. It catapulted the careers of Chevy Chase and Bill Murray (who supposedly disliked each other). Plus some of the one liners, though a bit mean-spirited, are still being quoted by the kids. But watching the film, it's just not as captivating. I don't know if there's really a way of preventing that. You make a movie with material that's funny at the time. Styles and humor are gonna change, so it's hard to know what will be funny in 10, 20, 30 years. <br/><br/>I'll always have a special place in my heart for Caddyshack. I spent many nights watching it with friends, so it has nostalgic value. And I'll forever love Dangerfield, Murray and Chase (until he became unfunny). Yet after seeing how dated it is, I'll never watch it again. I'm simply gonna remember Caddyshack for what it was years ago. Not how it looks today."

However plot doesn't matter much in this type of thing as it only matters if it's funny.  Some of it is. Carl's war with an absurd stuffed gopher is basic but works, while Rodney Dangerfield is always good if you like his brash style (I do).  However it is also full of vulgar jokes about vomit or floating turds.  To make it sellable we even get nudity thrown in  how very inventive!<br/><br/>This vulgar streak takes away from a film that does feel quite breezy and fuuny at times.  Chase is good  yes, I said it!  Dangerfield is an acquired taste while Murray is funny, even if his wit is never called on.  O'Keefe is a lead forced into the shadows by his costars.

Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney both were writers for National Lampoon's Animal House. They had based the character of Danny Noonan and his family on the famous Murray family, and when creating the character Ty Webb, they had one person in mind for the job and they also semi-based it off him Chevy Chase. The movie at the time was the movie with the most crude humor, but that humor is now part of cinematic history along with Cindy Morgan who played ""the hot chick"" That every guy wants. Caddyshack established Rodney Dangerfield's acting career as before he did some stand-up comedy. But over the years people still remember his quote, ""Oh, this is the worst-looking hat I ever saw. What, when you buy a hat like this I bet you get a free bowl of soup, huh?"" As he played Al Czervik whose the obnoxious but lovable newcomer to the club. Bill Murray also largely contributed to the movie as the infamous Carl Spuckler, who in the sub-plot of the movie, is ordered by his Scottish boss to kill all the gopher's on the golf course. Bill Murray's character will make you start laughing from the beginning.

","Critics and reviewers and people in general too often forget what is the best standard by which to judge a comedy film. In fact, it's the only standard. Is it funny? That's it. There's the whole of it, the single attribute that I took into consideration in assessing this film's cinematic value. I didn't debate it's social relevance. I didn't consider it's plot coherence. I didn't compare and contrast the individual actor's performances to previous ones of the genre. As far as I know, there had never before been a profound critique of the insidious contemporary American class structure in the guise of an absurd sports parody. And there probably still isn't, this movie just couldn't care less about making an intelligent point. It's only purpose is to be funny, and at this humble, meager task it's a soaring triumph. It is a friggin' non stop laugh riot.<br/><br/>There are so many iconic characters in this film that occupy such grand, imposing positions in the imaginations of appreciative fans; Ted Knight's outrageously pompous Judge Elihu Smails, Chevy Chase's irresistibly charismatic Ty Webb, Rodney Dangerfield's ridiculously gauche Al Czervik, and Bill Murray's sublimely revolting but adorable assistant grounds keeper Carl Spackler. Scarcely a day passes without me encountering someone, somewhere, either in person or on TV, attempting their version of Carl's quirky, crooked mouthed mumbled slurred speech. It's as ubiquitous and as irksome as an amateur reading of Shakespeare, but somehow more permissible. Bad Shakespeare is rarely just silly. The last two generations of comedy film fans have been the beneficiaries to an incalculable degree of Caddyshack's influence. Our culture is now infused with the blithe spirit of this preposterous film. It's certainly not the most profound cinematic experience of my life, but it is one of the most purely entertaining.<br/><br/>If the broad, slapstick nonsense isn't your cup of tea, then maybe you revel in the torrent of old-timey one liners, or admire the quick, witty dialog, especially that delivered by an enviably confident Chevy. Perhaps the refreshingly frank and genuinely sensitive relationship between Michael O'Keefe's Danny Noonan and Sarah Holcomb's Maggie O'Hooligan holds some attraction for you. Or maybe, like me, you're just an enthusiastic devotee of dancing gophers. Whatever your taste, there's got to be at least something here to take you to that special place in your heart - that secret golf course of the soul - where Fun & Games are fine and respectable endeavors. And if it so happens that a nice bit of exclusive, upper class, excessively manicured real estate gets obliterated in the process, so much the better."

Dangerfield and Murray Stole the whole show.<br/><br/>Chase, best line: ""My father never liked you.""<br/><br/>Dangerfield comes out with the funniest jokes you ever heard: ""The last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it"" and so many other lines that had tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>To the folks on here who criticize the movie as being low-brow and not as sophisticated as other movies: please, spare me your high-brow condescension. I enjoy those films as much as the next guy, same with the Mel Brooks films, which are also brilliant. There are all different types of humor, different types of funny characters. 'Seinfeld' is very different from '2 1/2 men', but they are both well crafted and funny."

","This movie is an awesome movie that is and probably always will be one of the best Rodney Daingerfield, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray movies separately and is one of my favourite to date. The movie is a must see for everyone as Chevy Chases,Bill Murrays and Rodney Daingerfields characters are just darn funny that anyone normal would laugh at. Overall I rate the film very highly for originality,Humour,wit and style so yes I recommend it maybe even to buy as it is so good and it keeps getting better by about double every time that you watch the film and so does the laughs as the movie as it go's along and I must of laughed around 35 times during the duration of the movie.

"possumopossum","Null","2","4","13 January 2007"," A Guilty Pleasure
","Normally, this isn't my kind of movie. Monty Python style humor just doesn't turn me on that much. Neither does watching people get loaded on grass or anything else. But once in a while, I like to watch a movie that doesn't make you think too much. Just makes you laugh. As Stephen King once said, it doesn't hurt to feast on bologna every once in a while.<br/><br/>In my own personal checklist, this movie has everything going against it. It's a little too raw in places, it's full of juvenile sex episodes, it has people smoking dope, and there is no coherent plot line or point to the jokes. But that is also the beauty of it. It is patently absurd and that makes it laugh out loud funny. I like that they borrowed music from other films for some scenes in this movie; the James Bond style music used when Carl is pursuing that gopher, the JAWS excerpt when the Baby Ruth bar falls in the swimming pool (incidentally, I never liked Baby Ruths, even before I saw this movie.), and the excerpt from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS when the Bishop played golf in the middle of a thunderstorm. I also loathe eighties music, but Kenny Loggins's I'M ALL RIGHT was perfect for this movie, and I was humming it long after it was over. Go and figure. I have every reason in the world to hate this movie, but I love it. And don't get me started on Cindy Morgan. YOWZUZZZ!!!!! Wonder what she's doing now? Anyway, even though I have every reason in the world to pan this movie, I like it for the very reasons I should hate it. It's a nice, farcical little party and makes you forget your troubles. Maybe because they had great talent like Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield in it. And Chevy Chase was a perfect Joe Cool type character. And Bill Murray was crazier than an outhouse rat as Carl. Sadly, I've had some brief, casual encounters with Viet Nam vets who are, shall we say, not playing with a full deck. That is who Carl reminded me of, and those fellows are a sad lot indeed. I'm being a little bit too generous, but 7.5 to 8 out of 10 for this one."

","This has got to be another funny and classic masterpiece of the two Ghostbusters Bill and Harold. Man and perhaps the most recognizable movie of the 80s with perhaps a funny dialogue, and scenes especially the ones with Rodney Dangerfield(may God rest his soul) I like especially the part when he wrecks the other guys boat and drops his anchor on his and says ""hey! You scratched my anchor!"" Ha ha ha ha! I love that part and not to mention the part with the candy bar, when it went into the pool, everyone went running out thinking it's crap. That is something I'll never forget. I like it also when Bill's character eats it and the rich guys lady faints. And no to mention the scene with the crazy golfer who keeps winning every game he does, until he looses one, and gets struck by lightning, and Bill just leaves him there, another memorable scene. The ones with the gopher was okay.... to say the least, it was funny, but not as funny as the scenes with Bill. Recommended to all fans of Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, and Chevy Chase, and Rodney Dangerfield. Watch it, you know you want to."
"Aaron1375","9","2","4","29 January 2004"," Great comedy that they just don't make anymore.
","One thing surprised me when I looked up this movie is that I did not know Harold Ramis co wrote and directed this movie.  So you learn something new every day.  This movie is very funny all the way through, a rarity these days.  Usually, comedies now have to either have a stretch of being sentimental, or they just do toilet humor the whole way through, or you have to watch fifteen other movies just to get the jokes.  This one stands on its own merit and it is funny throughout.  The caddies are the central part of the movie.  They aren't really the main part, but the bulk of the story goes through them.  They are also the least funny part of the movie, not to say they don't have their moments (Bill Murray did caddy, but I look at him more as a grounds keeper).  The cast is great, but for my money the two funniest guys are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield.  Bill's character is very funny as I love the scene with him and the priest and Dangerfield plays a wild guy who disrupts the everyday workings of the country club where this one is set.  Ted Knight is also good as a man who grows increasingly agitated by Dangerfield's presence.  There is somewhat of a plot there, but it does go here and there and that is all right with me.  There is also a pesky gopher, which sets up another great joke with Bill and the Scottish guy when Bill misunderstands him and this movie also made a floating Baby Ruth candy hysterical as well (another good scene with Murray).  Chevy Chase is in this one as well, and while he does okay he doesn't stand out like the others I have mentioned."

","Caddyshack always has a special place in my heart. Myself being a caddy I often call upon lines from the movie to entertain the people I'm caddying for, and more often then not the golfers understand what I'm talking about and tip me a lot of money. And this proves just how universal this film has became, that the members of all ages and genders understand my references and laugh along with me. The plot, or what is more of a series of sub plots, includes, Rodney Dangerfield and his quest to turn the club into condos, Bill Murray as the lovable groundskeeper Carl Spackler and his fight with the gopher, Danny Noonan's quest to get a scholarship by sucking up to the judge. All of these plots equals many great laughs. It is easily the greatest golf movie of all time, albeit be an admittedly short list."

It is one of the only movies that ever came with us on family vacation, so our families have nearly every line of the movie memorized.  I think that everyone should watch this movie at least a couple of times.  It deserves a certain amount of appreciation.  Here is my favorite 'Shack memory.  The year was 1997. Our family friends, who share the appreciation and respect for this film, had moved out to Oregon.  We went out for a visit and decided that it was only appropriate that we watch Caddyshack for old time's sake.  The only thing was, their big screen was not set up in the house yet, so we rolled it to the garage entrance and really sat in lawn chairs in the driveway and watched Caddyshack outside.  It was wonderful, an experience every true fan should try.  We still knew every line and the passing cars thought it was pretty great too.  I love it!"

"ericjg623","10","2","4","14 January 2002"," A classic!
","This movie will never get old, like ""Airplane!"", it's a comedy classic. The best part about it is it took some of America's top comic actors when they were at the prime of their careers and built a comedy that's more than just the sum of its parts. I mean, just having Bill Murray or Rodney Dangerfield in a movie, even a mediocre one, guarantees you will laugh, but this film features these two, along with Chevy Chase and Ted Knight, in what is arguably each man's funniest effort. <br/><br/>As with most comedies, the plot is pretty much incidental to the film itself. In this case, it's centered on a young caddy who can't afford to go to college, so he is forced to suck up to the head of the country club (Ted Knight) in an effort to get his blessing for a caddy scholarship. His golf mentor is a rich heir (Chevy Chase, back when he was still funny) who's into ""Zen golf"" and gives Danny advice like ""Be the ball"" and ""A donut with no hole is a Danish"". To complicate matters, a real estate developer (Rodney Dangerfield) shows up with his entourage, looking, not to join the club but instead to buy it. This is the setup for the rest of the film. From the start, the expansive, profane, boorish Dangerfield character clashes with the anal, rigid, and tantrum-prone club president, Judge Smails. And, in the background, Bill Murray is the groundskeeper who's been ordered to kill all the gophers on the course. Of course, this order comes from his Scottish boss, a man with an accent as thick as Guinness Stout, and Murray's character Carl, replies ""But if I kill all the golfers, they'll lock me up and throw away the key!""<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the basic premise. What makes this movie work are the lead actors, as well as first rate scriptwriting. You normally wouldn't think of a golf course as being the scene for great comedy, but with this bunch, anything goes. There's tons of great dialog; Judge Smails ""Danny, I've sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber. Didn't want to, but I felt I owed it to them"", Dangerfield to a woman at the club ""Last time I saw a mouth like that it had a hook in it!"", Carl to gopher ""Don't mind me, I'm just a harmless squirrel, not a plastic explosive or something"", and on and on. There's great physical comedy, especially when Rodney goes berzerk with his massive yacht, crashing into anything and everything in sight, and Ted Knight, whose eyes seem to bulge of of their sockets at least once a minute. In short, it's a comic classic that was hilarious 20 years ago, and is still funny every time I watch it now. A must see!  10 out of 10"

","I'm astonished at some of the mediocre response I've seen here.  Caddyshack is the greatest comedy of all time.  Every minute of the film contains a gem.  Chevy Chase is perfect, the man I hope to be someday.  While most people remember Murray and Dangerfield, they are the least hilarious of the actors.<br/><br/>If you happen to be one to knock this movie, you just don't get it, do you?  Well, why don't you just watch Titanic a couple more times anyhow.<br/><br/>Subtlety is the reason this movie is not just a sophmoric piece of 80s recycling.  There is the silliness if that's what you need, but to fully appreciate it, you need to absorb the artistry of every little comment. The quirkiness, the awkward dialogue, and the recurring snapshots of honesty make it work for viewers seeking something more than a two hour collection of jokes.<br/><br/>Following Danny, the straight man and lead character, you see how funny reality is for a poor white boy trying to be something more.  We all see how pointless the high life is eventually, and can then feel better about not being a member of a country club.<br/><br/>I grew up on this movie, no less.  Please love it."

And finally, you've got Bill Murray, who is in a class all by himself and was hilarious from start to finish, especially with Chase during the weed bit.<br/><br/>And Harold Ramis figured out, early into the filming, that the whole movie was going to center around Chase, Dangerfield, and Murray no matter what he intended.<br/><br/>The movie was, do doubt, funny but there were a lot of dead spots in it that you were just waiting to get back to the main 3 attractions."

","Mildly amusing outdoor comedy. Given the talent involved, the results are rather disappointing. I get the feeling much of the narrative was improvised as they went along-- the storyline stumbling around in choppy fashion between golf course antics, nude sex, and O'Keefe's effort at raising college money. It's almost like a series of skits minus coherent connecting threads to build on. Nonetheless, there are some generally amusing elements-- the mischievous gopher, with his impish little face and clever effects. I'm just sorry he wasn't given more pranks since the comedic possibilities are a bucket-load. Instead, we get Ted Knight mugging it up in Ted Baxter style, along with a curled-lip Bill Murray doing something or other. Otherwise, it's a boisterous Rodney Dangerfield injecting real energy, while Chevy Chase plays his mystical club member in fairly straight style.<br/><br/>All in all, I expected better given the splash the movie made on first release. Perhaps a sequel with a different director and writers could better tap the rich potential that's clearly there. That is, if our naughty gopher is still in residence."

"mark.waltz","7","0","0","14 August 2003"," A tribute to the late Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smalls)
","Lois Kibbee plays the relatively minor role of Mrs. Smalls, the snooty yet amusing wife of Judge Smalls (Ted Knight).  A veteran of several roles of society matrons on daytime soaps during the 70's and 80's, Kibbee had her only film role in this popular snobs vs. the slobs comedy which, second to ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", remains a testament of the style of comedy during the Jimmy Carter era.<br/><br/>Best known as the lovable and somewhat mellowed Geraldine Whitney Saxon on ""The Edge of Night"", for which she received several Emmy Nominations, Kibbee took time off from that role to make this film, where she first appears in the restraunt scene with no dialogue, but a similar Geraldine look of shock that sets the standard for her character.  Of course, her character is reacting to the pass made to her by the obnoxious Rodney Dangerfield. Later, Kibbee has two key scenes of slapstick where her character domineeringly tries to get the caddys out of the country club pool and notices an object in the pool which sends the whole club into panic; The scene flashes forward and while Kibbee watches, SNL veteran Bill Murray comes in for one of the funniest pay-off scenes in film history and Kibbee's reaction is priceless.  If there were Oscars for cameos, Kibbee would have been a shoe-in for this role.<br/><br/>Her next group of scenes surround the christening of a yacht where young Michael O'Keefe flirts with her over the amused objections of her hubby, Ted Knight; Once again, Kibbee gives the perfect reaction shot as her attempt to christen the yacht fails.  This is followed by Knight and Kibbee's return to their lavish home where O'Keefe and loose Cindy Morgan (as their niece) are about to perform the dirty deed.  Knight and O'Keefe get into it while Kibbee is taking a shower.  A shower-capped Kibbee peaks out as O'Keefe runs by in his underwear.  Her reaction of joyous surprise is another one of the subtle hysterical moments of the film, yet after this she only appears as an extra in the show's final scene.  ""Edge of Night"" fans who adored her as the formerly snobby Geraldine (based loosely originally on Rose Kennedy) were delighted by the comical way she was presented here, and later ""One Life to Live"" fans were gifted by her dramatic gifts as the evil matriarch Elizabeth Sanders.  The world of show business lost one of their true treasures in 1993 when Kibbee, who also wrote for ""The Edge of Night"" (and briefly ""Capitol""), passed away from a brain tumor.<br/><br/>I suggest catching this film to see an amazing performance of an actress who could say more with her eyes than most do with words, than catching her on ""The World of Soap Themes"" website where an episode of ""One Life to Live"" features her in a different type of role.  Hopefully, SoapNet will eventually show re-runs of ""The Edge of Night"" where she played an older lady with the heart and love of life of a 20 year old who not only was beloved by every character on the show but by practically the entire audience as well."

It has literally become a psudo language for people teeing up over the years.  As for the film itself, it continues to be hilarious each and every showing.  I would contend that the enduring quality of the film is that it combines 3 distinct types of humor.  First, you have the slap-stick humor of Chevy Chase, which I don't think works that well.  Second you have the traditional, fast and loose, comedy of Rodney Dangerfield, which I think is priceless.  Finally, you have the off the wall imagination of Bill Murray.  This movie marries all these styles very well.  This movie could have been a disaster without the quality of the writing and performances.

It did very well at the box office, costing almost nothing, and making over $60mil worldwide in 1980. There hasn't been another golf comedy this good since, and I don't think there ever will be. From the classic Rodney Dangerfield skits, to Bill Murray obviously having a free run from Harrold Ramis to improvise, it is the ultimate send-up of golf at its best.  No shots of Kevin Costner getting backspin off a 3-wood which destroys the movie (If a 3-wood backspins into a lake, what does a wedge do from a lay-up shot do you dumb film-makers?) or Happy Gilmore going nuts, this movie simply works in every scene.

","This 1980 ""summer comedy"" was given the Primetime hero's treatment last night on the NBC TV network (August 3, 2001).  A weekend anchor from the TODAY SHOW even presided over a series of pompous interviews (What was great/memorable about this part of your movie career?) that made it seem like a past Oscar-contender.  Director/co-writer Harold Ramis knowlingly smirked through all the worshipful treatment his effort was getting from this media giant.  It all seemed a bit ""scratch my back, I'll scratch your back"" when Bill Murray's family (including a co-writer of this movie) was given a commercial of sorts for a St. Augustine, FL Restaurant-bar themed ""Caddyshack.""  [Where were the mini-interview with the female performers or the musical composer?]        In certain ways, I don't understand how CADDYSHACK rated such a reverent homage.  Other than a previously drastically edited-down network broadcast of this effective vignette/sketch ""cotton candy,"" it wasn't a blip on my cultural ""radar screen.""  I can't remember hearing this much tribute being paid to it from any of the original audiences singing its praises.  Now more than two decades after its theatrical release, it does seem to have marked the onset of a genre of studio product that is quite UNcommendable.  Certain captivating ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch performers are routinely given the opportunity to take their improv skills or ""fixed"" characters to the ""big screen"" and thumb their noses at the Hollywood establishment or American traditionalism in a film project of some sort.  When a creative script and a charismatic comedian's persona jel and become ""more"" appealing, then you have a breakaway hit like BEVERLY HILLS COP was for Eddie Murphy (a SNL alumnus). The uncreative scripts and uncharismatic or downright offensive comedians are a horrendous litany of movie schlock. In the case of CADDYSHACK, the script concerns a ""sport"" that is familiar to mainstream Americans and is quite effectively irreverent toward the ""Country Club"" set.  Ramis' employing several strong comedic actors who are doing fair to middling (with apparently only slight direction from him at the helm) does make for a positive result.  NBC still managed to ""cut and paste"" around some of the profanities and barely-there nudity to make this a de-fanged product.  The gopher, to me, looked barely better than a TV character from my childhood TV watching: Bunny Rabbit on the CAPTAIN KANGAROO morning schedule.  I would be a more solid admirer of this film if the entire enterprise was greater than the sum of its separately funny (often hilarious) parts; unfortunately, it's not quite the best work that this director/writer has to offer.  Young videophiles in search of good counsel should keep searching in your video store's comedy section for the same director's GROUNDHOG DAY or a more effective comedy of this era titled GHOSTBUSTERS, if seeking a ""nostalgia""-comedy from the 1980's.  I give CADDYSHACK an 8 out of 10 [but not the snipped version of the TV broadcast]."

","I can't say enough about this movie. I have seen it well over 25 times and I'm still amazed how non-stop the jokes and hi-jinks come rolling off the screen. Possibly the funniest comedy to ever be captured on film. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield are unforgettable. Ted Knight is soooo good as Judge Smells. Too bad he left us sooner then expected, but his performance as a snobby member of Bushwood Country Club (he acts like he owns it) does such a great and believable job that I insist that he was the actor that took this comedy to that level that other films try to go. Harold Ramis did a fine job directing and nowadays you can't get the feel that Caddyshack has. A squirrel that sounds like a dolphin??? What were they smoking? 11 out of 10!"
"SiKnight","Null","0","0","6 April 2001"," One of my personal favorites
","OK, first of all, I personally have to say I do NOT agree with the reviewers that say Caddyshack is the ""worst movie ever"" or other negative comments. I have seen the movie many times over the years since it's debut (it came out in 1980 when I was 11 years old), and have always enjoyed it.  It never fails to get a laugh out of me.<br/><br/>I will admit however that this movie is not to everyone's taste.  My wife for example hates it.  She loves the sequel to it though, which I cannot stand.  It does have a lot of funny moments, like the priest playing golf in the rain, Bill Murray pretending to play golf while cutting down some flowers, and Rodney Dangerfield enraging Ted Knight.<br/><br/>I will also admit that my taste in comedies tend to lean more toward the silly (anything Monty Python, Mel Brooks movies, etc.) and downright stupid (Airplane, The Naked Gun, etc).  When I am in the mood for a comedy, I don't want to have to ""think"" about the humor in it.  I just want to laugh and enjoy myself.  I save the thinking for more serious movies like action, drama, or science fiction.  Too many movie critics (both ""professional"" and amateurs) tend to judge comedies too harshly, saying that they are too inane, that the gags are too stupid, and that the movie in general insults the intelligence of the viewer.  IMHO, so what?  In most cases, that's what makes a movie funny.  If you get caught up in the stupidity or silliness of a movie, then you're bound to be too critical and not enjoy the movie for the purpose it was intended.<br/><br/>Anyway, now that I'm done ranting, I would say to you that if you are thinking about seeing this movie, ignore the mixed reviews and just watch it.  If you don't enjoy it, you're out what, 4 bucks at the most for the rental?  Big deal.  If you do like it, then nothing was wasted, and you may even consider buying a copy."

","""Caddyshack"" is one of the greatest comedies ever produced.  This film is spirited and smart and is written in the tradition of National Lampoon.

Add to this the writing abilities of Brian Doyle-Murray and Doug Kenney and you have creative ability that has yet to be matched.  Of course there is the all-star cast reminiscent of the Second City and Saturday Night Live.  Chase is hilarious without trying to be, and Bill Murray is terrific playing a part that suits him well.  Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight are very talented actors and make the film what it is.  A great supporting cast including Michael O'Keefe and Cindy Morgan are also a key to success.  This film has it all, a great story, hilarious yet simple humor, and a cast that is one of the best ever assembled for this type of film.  ""Caddyshack"" is an undying film that should be and will be enjoyed by generations to come.

","How's this for a track record:  Since 1980 Harold Ramis has directed only eight films.  But three of these films (`Caddyshack,' `National Lampoon's Summer Vacation' and `Groundhog Day') are considered classics, another (`Multiplicity') is one of the neglected comedies of all time and a fifth (`Analyze This') was a smash hit and showed that Robert DeNiro had a flair for comedy.  Ramis has written all or part of 14 films; in addition to `Caddyshack', Groundhog Day' and `Analyze This,' he is credited for `Animal House,' `Meatballs,' `Stripes,' `Ghostbusters' and  `Back to School.' Finally, he acted in several of these vehicles, and in addition was in `Baby Boom' and `As Good As It Gets.'  And to top things off, he was part of the classic SCTV series.<br/><br/>So those of us who appreciate Ramis can sit back and watch a guilty pleasure like `Caddyshack,' knowing a genius is at work.  `Caddyshack' has been tagged as the ultimate snobs vs. slobs movie.  But it's really about cool. Chevy Chase is cool as Ty Webb, the greatest golfer never known.  Rodney Dangerfield is cool as the boorish (I couldn't ever imagine using cool and boorish in the same sentence) Al Czervik.  Bill Murray is cool as gonzo groundskeeper Carl Spackler.  Michael O'Keefe is cool as Danny Noonan, the caddy who seems to be the only one who's aware of what's going on.  And the gopher (fortunately, the fact that golfer and gopher sound a lot alike is only pursued once in the movie) that Carl  sets out to kill is particularly cool as he boogies to Kenny Loggins' `I'm All Right.'<br/><br/>The film has a bit of nudity, some grossness and a great ending that was the perfect mix for those seeking mindless pleasure in 1980.  It still delivers today."

","Let me start by saying that I used to be fensmn16. That name started to be bad, so I got rid of it. Now to the review. This movie is funny. It's a reasonable comedy that gives something to its cast. When looked at with movies like ""The Godfather"" it is stupid. Incredibly stupid. Of course how many comedies would be anywhere near as high as ""The Godfather"". But even still. I'm trying to get across the size of the film, which is basically a movie that you might want to watch at three in the morning if you can't get to sleep. Or one about which you might say to a friend, ""It's Friday night, we've seen almost everything else, so bring that one over and we'll hang out."" It's not a movie you would want to make a big deal about. Chevy Chase is good, Bill Murray is funny and Rodney Dangerfield is alright , being himself by always making remarks. Even with comedies, this one ranks as funny, but as far as good go, this one is a little lower. It does not rank up with movies such as ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" or, in my opinion, ""Beverly Hills Ninja."" Both of those have comedy (Beverly Hills Ninja is hilarious)and some decent acting. I personally think ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High has better acting than ""Beverly Hills Ninja,"" no doubt better than ""Caddyshack."" But again, you can't expect great acting from a movie of this type. If you go into this movie with that expectation, you will see a good movie. If you expect good acting, Dear God you are going to be dissapointed. Don't go into this movie open minded. Go into it looking for comedy, a movie you can tell your friends about.

","This is another gem from the 80's that I really like. This film is one of my top ten favorite sports comedies number 5 in my book. What really makes this unique to me is the fact that it's one centered on the sport Golf which isn't a sport that is really is filmed much and is cool since I like Golf and am a golfer myself. Though it's understandable why Golf isn't filmed that much as Golf isn't exactly the kind of sport that rings much excitement or involves a lot of action. Yet this film managed to do it very well because of what the characters do on and off the course.<br/><br/>Yeah, the film has this plotline on a underdog caddy that has big dreams of going to Law School and is trying to find a better way to get there. It's really not that important, it's a cliché plotline that by it's nature is really a closed line for the comedy. It's really what those other characters do we all pay attention to and is what the film is most concerned about.<br/><br/>The music is great this film has some of the best songs once again from Kenny Logins whom always seemed to supply a song or too for a film in the 80's. 
The judge Elihu Smalls by Ted Knight he's a good villain that you love to dislike as he's a snobby dirtbag that despite the accumulation of his wealth can't seem to afford integrity. He's deep down is a person that has a small man complex, hence his last name. He's always trying way too hard at being at the top of everyone else, from social status to just being well liked which he really isn't despite not knowing it.<br/><br/>However, the big three in this film are who make the film for me. 
The late great Rodney Dangerfield as Al Czervik this is my favorite role from him. What I really love about his character is the fact that despite being rich, he doesn't act like a stereotypical snob or upper-class blowhole. He's a person that just wants to be himself and have a good time as well as go against the grain, he never cares about what anyone else thinks. From how he dresses wearing a lot of loud t-shirts and not wearing the traditional suit or whatever else golfers and upper classmen wear. He has a flamboyant person where he's not afraid of expressing himself as well as doing whatever he feels like doing. His character just has a lot of the best lines and moments, my favorite is the boat scene where he has a yaut and is coming to the Judge whom has a sail boat that looks flimsy, unfortunately Al doesn't know how to drive it very well and as you can see a lot of hilarity follows.<br/><br/>Chevy Chase is good as Ty Webb, he's dryly funny. He's sort of a calm laid back golfer though you see is a bit self-involved and in some spots, he's sort of a slacker at heart. But I like that he really is a friendly guy he's helpful to the caddy giving him some philosophy on life (ok, not always the best kind but hey whatever works) and he likes to play Golf for fun which that what I like doing to. What's really funny is how in the third half of the film when he gets into the tournament we see he's a little nervous which makes his Karma's a bit imbalanced as we see him starting to make some strange spectacular blunders in his skill like shooting a ball straight though a birds beak; on the bright side that would be considered one of the best if strangest shots in golf history.<br/><br/>Bill Murray is great as Carl Spackler he's easily my favorite of the three, this was one of his first role and it's deffenatly one of his best. I really like how slobby, crazy and offbeat he is. He has a strange tone to his voice where it's a sounds like a combination of calm, stupidity, and lunacy; His plotline is a live action Looney Tunes where he has to hunt down and kill this rather smart Gopher. I really like that Gopher whom is the mascot of the whole film; he so cute, really like the puppeteering giving the Golfer some personality. As for Bill he just has some of the best darn lines and scenes in the film, from pretending to be a pro golfer by whacking some flowers and announcing the Cinderella Man story to himself. But just his antics in trying to kill the Gopher when he announces his plain at blowing away the golfer it's just comic gold.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is on par with hilarity.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"spencer-w-hensley","6","2","5","17 February 2017"," Has some very funny moments to be sure, but it's not the comedy classic some make it out to be
","Harold Ramis' 1980 golf comedy about the crazed hilarity of the caddies and members at an upscale country club got rather poor reviews upon release, and was not extremely successful at the box office. Many people were disappointed because it wasn't Animal House (which Ramis co-wrote), as both films had the same vein of humor and several people involved behind the camera. Within a few years though it gained a huge cult following and audiences and even some critics then went on to proclaim it as one of the funniest movies of all time. When I first saw it, I indeed found it to be very, very funny. That was also when I was a pre-teen mind you. Rodney Dangerfield's opening lines and battles with Ted Knight made me laugh out loud, as well as Bill Murray's famous battle with the gopher, and his scene with Chevy Chase smoking pot in his ""house."" While this is a funny movie, it was rather amazing to discover that many consider this a true comedy classic. Having not seen in it quite some time recently, I wanted to see if it was still the comedy classic I remembered it to be and if I agreed with the majority or if I thought it was more on the over- hyped side. Sad to say but the movie hasn't help up great 37 years later and I am leaning towards the latter side. Now I will admit Dangerfield's opening scenes, some of his other dialogue and screen time with Ted Knight is still very, very funny but looking back on it, that's only in the first half of the movie and towards the end it's a shtick that just gets tiresome and less funny. Knight on his own really doesn't bring the movie any extra momentum. His role seems more recycled from his days as Ted Baxter on the Mary Tyler Moore Show. It seems like the movie thinks it's still funny for others to put down and insult his character in the same way Ted Baxter was put down for being such an egotistical annoying pest, but it was only funny the first time, and Knight doesn't do anything different or special with his role here. Murray, who many people quote his dialogue from this movie to this present day is also really not given any opportunity to do anything special. He has a couple of funny moments with the gopher, but those really bring more of a chuckle than a genuine laugh, and his ""Cinderella Story"" scene which is put on lists of the all time greatest movie quotes is worthy of a slight chuckle but that's about it. There is nothing special about it to be on the list of the all-time greats. Murray's only laugh out loud moment was when he disinfected the pool and ate the Baby Ruth bar. And then the movie has subplots about caddy scholarships, yacht clubs, out of wedlock pregnancy and none of it seems to really quite blend well enough to do the plot any justice. Chevy Chase has one or two genuinely funny lines, but outside of that his character is really more of an underdeveloped and awkward distraction more than anything else. Michael O'Keefe who was wonderful with Robert Duvall in The Great Santini is wasted and also,sadly, an underdeveloped character. I guess he is supposed to provide support to the main comic stars, but his character is just another missed opportunity which could have made the movie funnier. I wonder if some think this is such a classic because of Dangerfield's funny bits. Were it not for him this movie would have totally sucked and been long forgotten. Because of him I am feeling nice enough to give it a modest 6. He was far better six years later in Back to School which Ramis co-wrote, that script had a far better use of his talent. Murray and Ramis fared better the following year in Stripes which holds up far better than this one does and eventually Groundhog Day over a decade later, and Chase and Ramis fared far better in National Lampoon's Vacation three years later. That's why I can't understand considering that Ramis made much funnier movies with the main stars of this one, why this one is considered the all-time classic, while the others don't come close to having the same status. This was Ramis' directorial debut and Dangerfield's first major movie so it was a good warm-up for them but they made much better movies later on. All in all Caddyshack is vaguely funny, but there is essentially no story, too many distracting, meaningless subplots, some of which are totally irrelevant to the so-called ""plot"" and only one truly funny main character (Dangerfield's). So while it definitely didn't deserve the poor reviews it got upon original release, it also shouldn't be considered the classic it is nowadays. 37 years later it's mildly amusing with a few funny moments worthy of a couple smiles and one or two genuinely laugh out loud moments. Even Happy Gilmore which some critics described as a Caddyshack wannabe is funnier and I think is more worthy of classic comedy status. So if you want to see if Caddyshack is the classic they say it is or if you want to see if it's held up to that standard 37 years later you will be disappointed. If you're just expecting a few chuckles to kill some time you won't be."

That's because despite it's achieving ""cult status"", this isn't all that good a film--with sloppy direction, an annoying performance by Bill Murray (who is capable of so much better), a worthless story about some teenagers (and I HATE most teenager movies from the 70s and 80s) and a rather wooden performance by Chevy Chase.

","Halfway through my first viewing of Caddyshack—despite how much I was laughing—I wondered aloud, ""What is this movie even about?"" Then I realized that Caddyshack doesn't know either. Director Harold Rammis walked onto the set of this film with a fragile script that was trampled by his star comedians—leaving us with this disjointed but entertaining mess that's become a classic.<br/><br/>Caddyshack opens with a hint of a story: Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a lanky teen who wants to save up for law school but makes pennies caddying at a fancy golf club. So, Danny tries cozying up to one of the club's wealthy patrons in a bid to win a scholarship. Oh, but before that can move forward, let's talk about the groundskeeper (Bill Murray) who's hellbent on killing a wily gopher! Oh, and the master golfer (Chevy Chase) whose humility hides his talent! And Danny's girlfriend (Sarah Holcomb) who's inexplicably Irish—and the rich bombshell niece (Cindy Morgan) who wedges her slender body into everyone's love lives—and Rodney Dangerfield who basically does a bit in every scene!<br/><br/>This all would be enticing if any of it intersected meaningfully, but Caddyshack only ever allows these characters to impact one another's lives at the very end—and even that set-up feels improvised. There are no stakes involved, no dramatic tension (which, believe it or not, is essential even in a comedy). All of these characters crowd the film and eat up its running time, leaving Danny's paper-thin plot as an afterthought. Murray is perhaps the only actor who really gets into his role and grounds it in the film's world, playing a filthy moron that no one particularly enjoys talking to who fumbles his attempts to rid the course of a destructive pest. But it's not Murray's film, nor is it Chase's or Dangerfield's. It belongs to no one.<br/><br/>As funny as it was, I was disappointed with the aimless direction of Caddyshack. It's a movie with hilarious moments rather a good comedy. You'll watch, quote, and revisit portions of Caddyshack for the wit and bombast of Dangerfield, Murray, and Chase—but hardly ever for the situations surrounding them."
"PredragReviews","6","1","2","2 May 2016"," Good Memories of 80's
","""Caddyshack"" was Harold Ramis' first job in the director's chair, and it shows: the tension is slack, there is far too much improvisation, and there's a lack of focus both in narrative and theme. Caddyshack features fine performances from Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, and of course, the gopher. This motion picture is replete with sight gags and one-liners that to this day are repeated by aficionados of clever satire. As far as the improv goes, one gets the sense that Chase, Dangerfield, and even Murray just sort of steamrolled Ramis. I'm sure it was a fun set to be on perhaps too much fun.<br/><br/>I can see that the jokes are mostly lame, the subplots are predictable and the acting rarely rises above the adequate. But I still can't help laughing like a drain whenever I watch it. You don't have to be a lowbrow to like this movie, and just because you think it's funny doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Caddyshack and Animal House withstand the test of time as two of the funniest comedies ever made... and that stands for a lot! <br/><br/>Overall rating: 6 out of 10."
"Brettyboy007","10","1","2","7 August 2014"," One of the best comedies I've ever seen
","Caddyshack is excellent! I loved this movie. I think I was in tears the whole time. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and Rodney Dangerfield make this movie.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is about life on a golf course. Everyone is rich and funny. There isn't a scene in this movie that is not funny. Scenes I can think of are the pool scene, the dance party, the boat, and anytime they are on the golf course.<br/><br/>I've seen this about 3 times now and it never gets old. Watch it! Bill Murray is great at trying to get the gopher. I'm not going to spoil any of the silliness that ensues."
"jokerswild1","9","1","2","2 May 2013"," Classic comedy
","This movie is but one of several classic comedies crafted by Harold Ramis, the man responsible for National Lampoon's Animal House, Stripes, National Lampoon's Vacation, Ghostbusters, Back to School, and Groundhog Day. <br/><br/>The performances are all around great, my favorite of them being Ted Knight's portrayal as the straight man, his reactions to the outrageous actions of Rodney Dangerfield's character are always hilarious. Chevy Chase plays a cocky golfer with a pseudo-Buddist take on things, and listening to him converse with other characters is never boring and always funny. The slapstick antics of the groundskeeper played by Bill Murray are very inventive and funny as he attempts to kill the silly- looking gopher.<br/><br/>My only real criticism of this movie is that it's somewhat unfocused, sometimes focusing on the hilarious antics of the golfers and caddies, and other times it focuses on a love story that feels kind of unfinished and is not told very well. It isn't a major problem, as the film is still mostly about the humor, but it is noticeable. That aside, I highly recommend this film for its gags, performances, and great quotes."

","Caddyshack is directed by Harold Ramis who also co-writes the screenplay with Douglas Kenney and Brian Doyle-Murray. It stars Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray, Ted Knight and Michael O'Keefe. Music is by Johnny Mandel and cinematography by Stevan Larner.<br/><br/>Chaos reigns at Bushwood Country Club when egos, wagers and a Gopher surface on the golf course.<br/><br/>Harold Ramis' debut movie is a pretty plot less affair that rises above this fact to entertain royally whilst providing a stage for the likes of Murray and Dangerfield to strut their defining shtick. Suffice to say that one needs to be enamoured with said artists to fully enjoy the picture, whilst a modicum of golf interest also helps. The youthful caddies of the piece, clearly meant to be at the core of the story, struggle to make headway with such boisterousness around them, but the chaos is finely tuned by Ramis and there's something uniquely funny about watching someone like Murray trying to blow up a disco dancing Gopher! An acquired taste but also a monster hit back in the day, Caddyshack is frayed around the edges and a little too goofy at times. But when it hits its comedy peak, visually and orally, it's not hard to get wrapped up in the chaos and find the laughs lurching out from the belly. 7/10"

","Chevy Chase, Michael O'Keefe, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray star in this 1980 Harold Ramis comedy. This mostly focuses on a young caddy, Danny Noonan (O'Keefe) who's trying to make enough money for college. He seeks advice from golf pro millionaire, Ty Webb (Chase) and tries to get wealthy snob, Judge Smails (Knight) to accept him as a Bushwood member, but eventually plays against him with Ty in a golf tournament.

","Harmless fun from the very early 1980's, wheelhouse of the teen sex comedy. Rodney Dangerfield and Chevy Chase are in the zone throughout, milking their most famous traits for all they're worth, while Bill Murray is largely wasted as the brain-dead burnout on the trail of a muppet gopher. A few iconic scenes from this one still linger in the public lexicon, like the wrapper-free Baby Ruth floating in the swimming pool or Chase's zen tee-box mantra of ""nanananana."" Close examination of the plot reveals dozens of holes, an almost complete lack of risk to the main players and a misplaced focus... but that's not really the point. A joyously carefree approach to filmmaking, it was quite clearly a non-stop party that just so happened to commit 98 minutes of semi-coherent story to film. Some punchlines may have lost their edge over time, but those that haven't are surefire winners; enough to make up for the very dated general atmosphere."
"StevePulaski","8","1","2","18 August 2011"," Makes me tee'd off at new films
","Golf was never as funny until the 1980's comedy classic Caddyshack was released. We always frown or roll our eyes when we see golf on one of our local channels, hogging the time for three or more hours. Then we think to this comedy and laugh. If Caddyshack can make a dull sport like golf funny, I'm waiting for Queballs or even Strikes to bring some excitement to the world of billiards or bowling.<br/><br/>Caddyshack has an all-star comedy cast, but they seem to work best on the green rather than at dinner or out in the world. Bill Murray, Ted Knight, Chevy Chase, and Rodney Dangerfield are the funniest in this film when they are making snarky remarks at each other while trying to enjoy a game of golf, a game that is known for its calming, stress-free nature. The problem, is Caddyshack tries to concoct a love story between multiple groups and keeps trying to nudge its characters off the field. When you have a good cast that works well in a designated area why shun them away from that area? I would've been perfectly content with a movie that where more than half of it takes place on a golf course. Just as long as it featured the comedic talents of these four guys.<br/><br/>There really is no plot either. Just well-developed characters that sustain the entire movie. There's Ty (Chase) the most laidback person in the world. Carl (Murray) the grounds-keeper of the course who spends most of the film trying to exterminate a pesky gopher who distracts other players. Al (Dangerfield) a rich real estate cad who does nothing but boast the whole film in his vulgar, yet undeniably hilarious ways. And, finally, Judge Elihu Smails (Knight) the co-founder of the course.<br/><br/>If you take four parrots, caged them up for days without letting them out, then released them in a room with each other they would go nuts and frolic forever. That's exactly what Chase, Dangerfield, Knight, and Murray. They unleash each one of their special qualities out on the film. Which is what makes Caddyshack so funny and so memorable. It's quotable because of many comedic parties, and entertaining because their antics are unpredictable.<br/><br/>This is one of the more subtle spoof films of all time. Caddyshack isn't marketed as a parody film, but it does bring comedic jokes about the game of golf and just makes it funny in its entirety. It doesn't go on a rampage trying to get as many references in as possible, but it winds up accomplishing more than any modern day spoof.<br/><br/>If the Direct-to-DVD National Lampoon series now among us took time to pay closer attention to ""worthless"" things like writing, casting, and humor, they could maybe pull off something like Caddyshack. Instead, they choose the easy way out by putting some bikini girl on the DVD cover hoping people will see this as an American Pie raunch-fest, when really, it's PG-13, and if it is R rated, it has very little to offer.<br/><br/>Caddyshack doesn't try to hard and it still succeeds. The inspiration is the four leads who each make up a small part of a very successful film. It has no limits, no regrets, no mercy, and no shame.<br/><br/>Starring: Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight. Directed by: Harold Ramis."

","I make it an annual rite of summer passage to watch Caddyshack, either on DVD or the Golf Channel, as it's been an important film to me and my friends growing up as a teen in the 1980's. We would quote many classic lines, especially when playing miniature golf during those summer days back then. You know the story and cast by now, but let me add that I feel that both Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield's chemistry make this film a legendary comedy, and their scenes together are priceless and hilarious. I also liked the chemistry between Ty Webb and Danny Noonan, as they both seem to understand each other's motives. Bill and Brian Doyle Murray have funny moments too at Bushwood Country Club, as the slobs battle the snobs once again."

","This is obviously an iconic comedy. And starring Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray, and Cevy Chase, my expectations only increased. But what really turned this into a good movie was the role of Judge Smails played by Ted Knight.<br/><br/>Knight was clearly the best performance in this film, and being able to hold that up against the fore mentioned comedy stars only makes his performance that much better. Forget the billing in this film, Knight is the main character.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it was good but not great. I loved all the characters getting screen time in a movie that seemed to have multiple plots at a time. But that's a good thing. It also has a hidden message of doing what you love to do, rather than doing what's normal or expected.<br/><br/>But there were some downers to Caddyshack. I seems like they sped the pace up throughout the movie; most notably the final match and caddy tourny. They montaged their way through it without really diving into them.<br/><br/>It's a good sports movie that's better than Bull Durham, but not quite up to the level of Slap Shot. You'll laugh your way from start to finish, but never crack up the way some films do. Still this movie is worth it for Knight alone, as well as the great one liners produced throughout."

","There are few comedies that you can truly watch over and over and not be bored. This might be the tops in that category. Is it dated, yes of course, anything that is almost 30 years old is going to look different than the quality of film today but what makes Caddyshack work is that it is unique in it's ability to be both irreverent and timeless at the same time. It does not reference topical jokes or use 80's clichés so it can be watched by any generation and still be funny. I really can't stand Chevy Chase except in a few things and here he is just mildly funny and a bit pompous, but the other actors do a great job, Cindy Morgan is delicious, Rodney offers some of the best classic one liners ever, Ted Knight is hilarious and Bill Murry is brilliant as the disgusting moronic grounds keeper and has some of the most quoted lines in movie history.

You could write four or five different plot outlines focusing on the different B-stories, but the best one probably just focuses on general ""comic goings-on at an exclusive golf club,"" (Rob Hartill, imdb Plot Outline).<br/><br/>This is Harold Ramis's first film. He would go on to make the first National Lampoon's Vacation movie with Chevy Chase, and one of the best comedies ever made, Groundhog Day. We also have him to thank for Analyse This. For fans of Ramis, this is definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>Bill Murray is insane and over-the-top (and pretty funny in places), Cindy Morgan is cute as Lacey Underall, the big boss's daughter, the kid Danny Noonan is funny looking and i'd be happy if I never saw Rodney Dangerfield ever again - but the gem of the piece is without a doubt Chevy Chase. He's the reason to see this. This is his first big movie role after being discovered on Saturday Night Live (his career would get its big boost with Vacation in 83 and Fletch in 85) - and its a knockout. Its one of those parts where he'll say a line completely deadpan, and you're ears will do a double-take, and you'll go: hang on, what did he say?<br/><br/>For fans of undergraduate comedy like Animal House, this is worth a look. If anyone is particularly offended by racial humour, there are enough racial stereotypes and jokes in the beginning to end a peace conference. They're not malicious, and they peter off after the first half hour, and after this it ends up being enjoyable and pretty funny - especially Chevy Chase. 6/10."
"jrs-8","5","2","7","30 October 2002"," I know I am in the minority but......
","I don't think ""Caddyshack"" is that good. I think it's ok. I'll say right off the top that I am not a golfer. I never have been and probably never will be. Does that have anything to do with my not seeing this film as the classic many people do? Perhaps. But being an avid golfer wouldn't have stopped me from finding holes in the script.<br/><br/>Is it really believable that Bill Murray's character would actually be hired at such a posh golf course? That a gopher would present that many problems? Was it really necessary to include the sub-plot with the main caddy and his girlfriend who, without reason, is given an Irish accent? SPOILER WARNING!! With so much money on the line would the winning shot falling into the hole because of an explosion not be contested in the least? It was clearly shown that the ball had stopped short of the hole. The match was over. But the bad guys couldn't be allowed to win right? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Before all the trash gets thrown at me I will point out some things I liked about the film. There are some funny moments. The Baby Ruth scene with Bill Murray is classic. Had there been more belly laughs like that I would see what everyone else sees. I also liked Murray's scene of pretending to be in the Masters as he destroys flowers with his imaginary tee shots. Rodney Dangerfield steals the movie in every scene he is in. His non-stop banter is an absolute riot. Cindy Morgan looks fantastic even if her role is unnecessary. Michael O'Keefe is totally likeable as the lead caddy.<br/><br/>As for the other performances, Chevy Chase is amusing enough in an underwritten role. I wish his part had been bigger. But since he has such contempt for the club and its owners it makes no sense that he would be in the bar in a key scene that serves only to set up his being part of the big match at the end. And why not give him more then one major scene with Bill Murray? Two greatly talented comedians should be sharing more screen time. Ted Knight is basically playing his Ted Baxter from ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". And that gopher!! It was cute at first but finally became an annoying distraction. Perhaps the creators realized the material was so thin.<br/><br/>In the end ""Caddyshack"" barely makes par. It certainly isn't on the level of ""Animal House"" which obviously influenced this film. Again I know I am in the minority on this one. But laughter is involuntary. What makes one person laugh won't necessarily make another laugh. Many people laughed throughout this film. I laughed only sporadically."

","""Caddyshack"" is a hit-or-miss comedy that I can't exactly classify as a comedy classic, like many have.  There are undoubtedly some hilarious moments provided by the great Rodney Dangerfield.  My favorite line he says in the movie is, ""I just got head by Amelia Earhart!"" after a plane flies over his head and barely misses him.  I don't know, maybe the humor is outdated.  Maybe it would've been funnier if I saw it when it first opened in 1980.  Nevertheless, I wasn't laughing as much as I thought I would.  The cast is great, without a doubt.  With a cast of actors including Dangerfield, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray it's hard to go wrong.  I found this movie pretty harmless.  I guess after watching movies like ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Road Trip"" it's hard to get grossed out by the gags in this one.  Because I did hear criticism about the tastelessness of the gags.  I liked the song ""I'm Alright"" and love singing along to it. <br/><br/>
Some call this triumphant in its genre.  I found it pretty ordinary.  I wasn't laughing as hard as I thought I would.  Maybe Rodney should've made a couple more appearances.  He was in it for an amazingly short time.  He always spices a movie up when he's in it for the majority.  ""Caddyshack"" is simply a comedy that doesn't quite rise above the barrier of comic mediocrity.  I just didn't laugh enough.  <br/><br/>My score:  6 (out of 10)"

Caddyshack. Some of the funniest folks in the last half of the last century are
involved with Caddyshack.<br/><br/>With many little subplots going the main plot involves the rivalry between the
head of the club Ted Knight who is also a judge and Rodney Dangerfield who is
a filthy rich and brash visitor. Dangerfield is his usually cheerful and obnoxious character, but he presses Knight's buttons. Some of the funniest
moments of the film is Knight reacting to Dangerfield. <br/><br/>Chevy Chase is an interesting fellow himself, a rather iconoclastic character who doesn't even keep score as he explains his philosophy of life to young
Michael O'Keefe who is one of the caddies just trying to pick up some extra
dollars and suck up to the rich who are regulars at the club.<br/><br/>Knight reminds me of the character of the father of the prospective bride whom Auntie Mame was desperately trying to keep nephew Patrick from
marrying. Willard Waterman in Auntie Mame was not on his home ground
and Rosalind Russell capitalizes on that. You see Knight on his home turf (no pun intended) but it yields him no advantage as Dangerfield just shows him 
up over and over.<br/><br/>We cannot forget Bill Murray who is an iconoclastic character in his own right.
He's one of the groundskeepers and has been assigned the task of ridding the
world of gopher who has taken residence at the country club and leaving inconvenient holes in the ground. It's a battle of wits and guess who comes
out on top?<br/><br/>Henry Wilcoxon plays a Catholic bishop who likes to golf. He isn't exactly Father O'Malley moved up in the ranks. Wilcoxon is best known for all the
Cecil B. DeMille films he did and his final scene has a DeMille like quality. <br/><br/>With the gopher character Caddyshack expertly blends animation with the live
players. Big kudos go out to the animators for the gopher.<br/><br/>Don't expect any sophistication, but Caddyshack will give you lots of belly laughs with many to spare"

I was pleasantly surprised by my reaction to this movie. The movie is really not about golf, but about the zany antics of the many characters in the film. The movie is crude and juvenile, but the humor really works. Not every joke is going to work, but there was enough screwball comedy to keep me chortling throughout the film.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is Harold Ramis's directorial debut and he also written the screenplay along with Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney. Ramis previously wrote one of my favorite 1978 comedies, Animal House. It is natural that he would bring the same type of humor to this film. As for directing, Ramis did a rather good job in his debut. There were some issues regarding connectivity of the characters, but I think he passed his first test.<br/><br/>When coming up with the screenplay of the film, Murray and Ramis took experiences from their personal lives and added them to story. Growing up, they worked as caddies. So I liked how there was more of a personal touch to the movie than one would expect. One of my favorite scenes, the Baby Ruth candy in the swimming pool scene, actually happened for real at Murray's high school. Once you add the Jaws theme music, you have one of the best scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the film barely exists. What I mean is that the film is just a rapid series of comedic actions meant to make you laugh and in a screwball comedy, that is just fine. I will give you a basic outline of the plot. Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a caddy working at the Bushwood County Club. In order to get himself a bright future, he wants to earn a caddy scholarship from Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), the owner of the club. Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) is a rude millionaire who wants to purchase the club, but Judge Smails has no time for Czervik's attitude. There is Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) who is a charming golfer who helps Danny try to figure out his true life goals. Finally, we meet the groundskeeper, Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) who is hell-bent on eliminating a gopher that is ruining the golf course.<br/><br/>Hence here is where my biggest problem with the film lays. You may have noticed there was a lot jammed into the plot, even though there is not much of a plot to begin with. These characters are very entertaining in their own segments because they bring a different personality to the table, but they really are not connected. You would think that the actions of these characters would lead to some grand outcome that would connect them, but unfortunately that is not the case. The Carl Spackler chasing the gopher segment has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Although, those scenes are where I was most consistently laughing and Bill Murray absolutely rocked it as Carl Spackler.<br/><br/>Each character has a different persona, and the actors did a great job portraying those personas. Chevy Chase is more of a charming, laidback golfer who is great at wooing in the ladies. Rodney Dangerfield is a witty, acerbic man who delivers rapid fire lines at the speed of light! Dangerfield was previously known as a comedian, and this is his first big movie role. I was impressed how he delivered his lines. His scenery-chewing, along with his insults and one-liners make him a memorable character. Bill Murray does wonderful as the self-absorbed groundskeeper, although it does make you wonder if this character is a remnant of Animal House. Ted Knight does a solid job as the judge, but maybe he is over-reaching just a little. Michael O'Keefe, who was so good in 1979's The Great Santini, delivers another strong performance here.<br/><br/>I liked Caddyshack. Some people make it out to be a comedy classic of the ages, but I consider it to be an above-average screwball comedy that will make you laugh. The characters, even if they don't connect to the film as a whole, are memorable and funny. There are some quotable lines (thank you, Mr. Dangerfield). This is all light fun, and it does everything a comedy should do. It gets nothing but better for Mr. Ramis here on out. By the way, even that gopher is cute in an odd way.<br/><br/>My Grade: B"
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","3","18 March 2016"," Above average comedy of its era
","I find the po-faced seriousness with which golfers take their sport to be rather funny, so this lampoon of the whole golf industry is a delight to watch. It's a bit of a madcap character piece with lots of offbeat stars interacting and getting involved with one another, and at some moments it's similar to the surreal highlights of AIRPLANE, although it also has that 'frat house party' style atmosphere popular from the early '80s.<br/><br/>What I particularly enjoy about CADDYSHACK is that there's no single star. Chevy Chase pops up here and there to deliver some delightful non-sequiters, and Bill Murray steals every scene he's in playing the slow-witted groundsman. My favourite star of all, though, is Rodner Dangerfield, who ably mixes stand-up humour with acting and zings off the screen for all of his five or six moments.<br/><br/>CADDYSHACK isn't an entirely successful production, and some elements are rather silly; that stupid gopher, for example, which looks like it belongs in a kid's film. But it's affectionate, it has plenty going on, and Harold Ramis does a very good job of holding it all together as director. The JAWS spoof is a definite highlight."
"SnoopyStyle","8","1","3","12 June 2014"," Great master class of comedic legends, younger cast not so much
","Danny Noonan is putting everything he makes into his college fund even though he's not sure what he wants to do. He's a caddy at an exclusive Bushwood country club. The club is filled with wealthy eccentric members and an unbalanced greens keeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) out to get the gopher.<br/><br/>The comedic power assembled in this is amazing. Harold Ramis made a pretty loose comedy. There're a lot of improvisations. Bill Murray really steals many scenes with all his ramblings and his gopher partner. Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight face off in a master class of comedy. Chevy Chase is playing the guy above it all. The weakness in the movie is the younger cast. They can't quite keep up and they pale in comparison. The movie works best with the elder statesmen Dangerfield and Ted Knight squaring off."

I find those who get the jokes or appreciate them the most, have at least a comedic vocabulary, meaning s/he was raised with humor as an angle to approach life.

","An exclusive golf course has to deal with a brash new member and a destructive dancing gopher.<br/><br/>At age 30, I have finally seen ""Caddyshack"". Growing up in the age of cable, I think it could be found on one channel or another almost every day. Other people my age have likely seen the film, or at least parts of it, at least a dozen times -- maybe fifty. And now I join the ranks, though I have no interest to make repeat viewings a habit.<br/><br/>That might sound like I did not like it. On the contrary, it actually exceeded my expectations by quite a bit. I thought it would be dated and no longer great, but quite the opposite. Chevy Chase is in top form here, and looks great -- especially now that I am used to seeing him on ""Community"". Bill Murray is pretty much always great, and this is no exception. I was never a fan of Rodney Dangerfield (though my dad is) and here he impressed me. All in all, pretty great.<br/><br/>The only part I did not understand was Danny's attraction to Maggie, the Scottish waitress. She has a mullet, is only average looking, has an odd voice... and then, when her pants come off, she has the worst granny panties. She is hiding nothing good under those clothes! I do not blame him at all for being attracted to the rich niece."
"st-shot","6","1","3","11 May 2011"," Caddy Shack nearly breaks par.
","After writing the enormously popular Animal House director John Ramis sat in the director's chair for the first time and wisely allowed Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield to do their own thing in this uneven comedy about Country Club swells and employees. There's plenty of funny in Caddy Shack but plenty of bogey making as well.<br/><br/>The members of the club led by Ted Knight's pompous Judge Smails are predictable clichÃ©s while the frat house has been moved to the links to accommodate the animal class of 1980. Wading into a morass of diversionary minor plots and idol chatter Bill and Rodney tear the place up with their genuine brand of irreverence. <br/><br/>Groundskeeper Murray acting and looking like he's taken a fair share of nine irons to the head delivers more than half of the films funniest moments particularly while destroying flower beds with a driver and delivering play by play. Dangerfield gathers up most of the remaining laughs by showing no respect for the snobbish members. Chevy Chase as the club pro is a smarmy waste and the rest of the cast verbose extras. Caddy Shack is clearly a two man show, everything else ends up in the sand trap."
"pk19652001","10","1","3","21 January 2010"," Classic.
","With Animal House, this is one of the great all time classic comedies. Bar none. There isn't enough praise you can give this movie, from the millions of classic one line jokes, to just the overall performances. There's the old saying, they just don't make them like this anymore. And that applies to this gem. Even the small characters like Spalding are funny as heck. When is the last time you saw this many funny actors in one movie. Never.. Egos were put aside to put this great movie together. From a great soundtrack, to just the overall chemistry of the cast. You can't do any better than this. And for all the total morons and newbs out there that gave this anything less than an 8- Go home.

","Caddyshack will always have a place in my head, because it's one of the fewest movies that has made me fall asleep more than one occasion. 3, to be exact. I tried to ""be the Caddyshack mark"" , but the first time I watched it... well... zzzzzzzzzz. Then, I even rented the movie to see if my original somnolence was due to exhaustion. Nope. I fell asleep twice. I've played golf, and yes, I've enjoyed Chase's, Murray's and Dangerfield's work many times, but I cannot grasp why is this movie supposed to be so funny. I've read some people say that the more they've watched it, the more layers of comedy they've discovered. Well, what's the point of watching it over and over, looking for the comedy, when the movie didn't make you laugh immediately? I'm quite sorry, but given the hype, the endless hype, and more hype, I felt overwhelmingly disappointed by this movie, thus I'd give it 0/10. 0 represents ""letdown""."

","I feel as though I wasted 90 minutes of my life, but for some weird reason I am behooved to waste more by writing about how disappointed I was by this. Therapy I guess. Anyway, here goes: Adam Sandler says this is his favorite movie of all time. I can see why. Painfully shallow, he who gave us Waterboy and Big Daddy has picked the movie that was without the most overrated of the 1980s. What in the hell is funny about this? I think it's some sort of weird social phenomenon whereby it's got a reputation of being funny, so everyone feels as if they don't like it there's something wrong with them. So then they go and say they like it. And if anyone can explain to me why either this or Blues Brothers is funny, please email me. But I don't get it. I've heard of suspension of disbelief, but this is nuts. In closing, I would like to ask the astute reader to read the positive comments for this movie and judge for themselves the level of intellect of their authors. If these people do not seem like the crowd you normally hang out with on a weeknight you might want to try ""Spinal Tap"" or ""The Big Lebowski"" instead."

","Caddyshack is definitely a great comedy, though its sequel is only mediocre. Ted Knight is at his best here, soundly better than Robert Stack of the second. Rodney Dangerfield is also hysterically funny here, with every line he says being awesome. Chevy Chase's character Ty Webb is funny, if not as much as the others but still a worthy performance. I'm surprised to see no one mentioned Henry Wilcoxon as the Bishop as a stand out. This is one of his last roles, yet all of his scenes are funny, especially his golf game of epic ""biblical"" proportions. His laugh is priceless and his eyebrows go with his character. Danny Noonan is the only boring element of the movie, but still better than the most exciting characters in other movies. The man who steals the show however is Bill Murray. Every line he says leaves you laughing for hours and his whole performance is amazing. If you enjoy good comedy, make it a point to see Caddyshack."
"simonrosenbaum","5","2","10","23 October 2006"," Dangerously unfunny!
","I've just watched this for the first time and thought it a bit of a mixed bag. I liked the way it starts and found Chevy Chase very funny and I like Bill Murray's unusual turn but when Rodney Dangerfield turns up it absolutely spoils it for me. I find his performance one of the unfunniest and annoying I've ever seen. Also the tone of the film is a bit confused with the occasional dramatic scenes getting in the way of the over the top slapstick as if it was originally going to be a more serious film. The film is still a fairly enjoyable if unsubtle comedy which has obviously influenced a generation notably the Farrelly brothers and the American Pie series. Just a shame about Dangerfield. (5/10)"
"jbartelone","5","2","12","16 January 2007"," Has Some Funny Moments. But Hardly A Classic
","Don't get me wrong, The film has some funny moments no question, and it is for many people a comedy classic. But for me, something appears to be missing or tainting the film from approaching symbolic comic status.<br/><br/>It could be the predictability of the characters along with the shallow superficial jokes and situations that they are involved in, (i.e drugs, golf, and sex.) In my view, the film may be rated higher by the teenage crowd who are interested in this type of simplicity entertainment.<br/><br/>There is also the issue that there is not enough comic plot for a full length movie. The ""big bet"" golf tournament scene wants the audience to be drawn into the ""great moment of ha-ha comedy."" The problem is that the one-liner jokes, some of the best, in the first half-hour or so, do not make up for the rest of the movie that seems to drag and isn't sure where it wants to take us. Maybe, if you like golf, this movie will do more for you.<br/><br/>Another problem is Rodney Dangerfield. While I am not a fan of his personally, I ADORED his work in the movie ""Back to School."" where he had some GREAT one-liners. In Caddyshack, every word that comes out of Dangerfield's mouth is neither funny nor clever, it is just obscene. I have no issue with R-rated language when it serves a purpose in any movie. But here in Caddyshack, I failed to see the point of Rodney's character other than to drop F*** bombs. What's the point? There are some great veteran comic actors in this film. It's just too bad that they didn't have a stronger storyline or a funnier script throughout the movie to make it better."

","I know I'll get blasted for this, but...<br/><br/>Caddyshack is a bad movie. A bad, mediocre movie. A boring movie, at times.<br/><br/>Dangerfield, Chase and Murray are not over the top here. They are waaaay over that. Each one of them displays their range whenever they get to appear on screen. Dangerfield is incredibly hilarious, Chase is dry and witty (sorta like David Spade), and Murray does his best ever imitation of Bluto Blutarsky (John Belushi). Oh, and let's not forget the gopher. The mere thought of it makes me laugh.<br/><br/>So, how on earth did no one notice that the audiences would be interested in the interaction between those three? I can only think of one scene where Chase and Dangerfield appeared together, and they might have crossed one or two words. Meanwhile, we are subjected to the tediousness of stale, bad jokes made by all the caddies. <br/><br/>Maybe I am wrong here, but if I had gathered those 3 comedic geniuses, I would have made a picture around them. Harold Ramis instead made a movie about an unknown, who nobody cared (or cares) about, and littered the film with sporadic appearances by the top notch actors.<br/><br/>Kinda like going to a Pink Floyd concert and learning that they would sing 4 of their best songs, separated by 10-15 minutes of music by bad bands.<br/><br/>Still, I rate this one a 7 / 10, just because the actors really push the script to the limit (that is, if there was a script to begin with).

After an opening credit bicycle ride from a crowded and noisy, low class home, he passes a strip of mansions to classy Bushwood Country Club backed by Kenny Loggins' smooth party anthem I'm Alright: bridging a grainy late-70's yacht rock groove into the preppy vs anti-preppy decade to come...<br/><br/>Then Danny winds in and out of misadventures including an attempt to appeal to Ted Knight's stuffy Judge Smails for a possible college scholarship while faithfully caddying his mentor in Chevy Chase's quirky millionaire Ty Webb, sharing the most subtle yet hilarious moments in-between butting heads with cool cat Italian bully Scott Colomby, the other ""kid"" whose role wasn't diminished to a cameo. <br/><br/>The R-Rating is earned between our caddy and one of the hottest of underrated and underused starlets, Cindy Morgan, far more beautiful and interesting than Laurie Metcalf as Danny's knocked-up girlfriend (using a bad accent of some kind), whose bland romantic melodrama should've been left on the cutting room floor...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bill Murray, despite the overall popularity of his character, isn't at his best here, chasing a stuffed gopher that, getting around cooler and funnier than CGI, seems a nod to b-movies that can't afford any better... <br/><br/>With his bottom lip hanging to pilot a contrived manner of speech, in place of his MEATBALLS (and future STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS) glib confidence, Murray's assistant groundskeeper, Carl, seeming part of an SNL skit stretched too long.

You can't help but like every single character, every moment of crude and lewd, right down to Brian Doyle-Murray telling a caddie to ""Pick up that blood!""<br/><br/>I think Caddyshack's peer, John Landis' Animal House is a funnier movie because of the chances it takes spearing sacred cows, but Caddyshack may be the smoother-frothier?-film because it avoids lagging at the start of the third reel, something that Landis throws in to build up steam for his big, obnoxious cherry-bomb-in-the- toilet ending.<br/><br/>Caddyshack just ambles along, all big-heart and Lacy Underalls.<br/><br/>Animal House is, at its core, something serious. There's an edge to the humor and to the end-of-Camelot story. I wrote a long review of AH some years ago. The boys and girls at Faber College (""Knowledge is Good!"") are about to smacked upside the head by the hideous specter of Vietnam.

","This is a funny movie. The plot is that a caddy at a golf course named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a doing just about anything to raise money to go to college. While Danny is trying to get a caddy scholarship from the owner Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), Smails has to deal with a brash new member of the course Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield). When a character is played by Dangerfield it's pretty much what you would expect. Al is eccentric, and a loudmouth. He's always annoying Smails with his over the top machines, weather it be his Rolls-Royce, his boat, or even his golf bag. Anyway while all that is going on, there's a subplot about Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) the assistant greens keeper who is told to kill every gopher on the field. Carl is a lovable idiot and goes way overboard and uses sniper rifles, and plastic explosives to kill one gopher, who ends up surviving. Along the way are two golf games, hilarious one liners from Dangerfield and brilliant comedy from Knight and Murray. It was the first film of Harold Ramis who does a really great job. I certainly recommend it if you like great comedy."

So, let me start with small conspiracy theory. The Blu-Ray movies are doing pretty well. I have never had the money really for any new movies in the wrapper, so I buy movies at Walmart. I have to say Walmart, because they are the only store in my area that offer such a volume of the $5 movies. There are a lot of older ""classics"" and I usually am happy with what I buy. I play my movies on a PC and normally they play back at good full volume. The movies from those bins also demonstrate good video. Caddyshack did not do well in the video or the audio department. In some parts of the flick the picture was fine and in other areas the video was terrible. Especially in indoor scenes. There's no real question about my software or my personal computer or my A/V or my DirectX(I realize I am getting technical here. But most people know about computer audio and video.) I simply have no problems with most of my movies. Back to the conspiracy theory. Now that traditional DVD's with the dual layer format are being offered at lower prices, what kind of mastering is going on by the studios with the rights to all these titles? True, the movie was not expensive, but it was still money. I have seen other movies that don't give the best viewing experience. I watch movies all the time on my desktop, because I have the nice LCD monitor. Did I say nice? As for my sound and video, 90% of my movies all sound nice.

","Following suit of Animal House and the National Lampoon brand of humor, Caddyshack is an acceptable and amiable enough comedy about a golf course and its wacky inhabitants. There's the hotshot pro golfer, played by Chevy Chase; the loud-mouthed tycoon visiting for a championship (Rodney Dangerfield); and the goofy caretaker (Bill Murray) who is trying to rid the park of its pesky resident gofer (a really cheesy-looking muppet).<br/><br/>The film's legacy precedes it and, unfortunately, speaks too well for itself  it simply doesn't live up to its name. Too many gags are obvious, too many fall flat, and only a few are actually memorable  incidentally all of which involve Rodney Dangerfield, who steals the film from everyone else, including Murray.<br/><br/>The plot is extremely thin: it's really just about a golf course. There's a teenaged caddy who dreams of winning a scholarship, the hot babe who tries to steal him away from his girlfriend, the old stuck-up conservative figure who can't stand liberal Dangerfield's behavior and of course an abundance of slapstick material to fill out these different subplots.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Harold Ramis, usually a rather reliable director, here giving another solid directorial effort in the vein of producer-friend Ivan Reitman (""Ghostbusters"") and John Landis (""The Blues Brothers"").<br/><br/>""Caddyshack"" is at its best when it isn't trying too hard, which isn't often. A few times it steps out of line and risks it all for a huge gag that will backfire, but oh well.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film worth mentioning is Bill Murray's groundskeeper and his annoying gofer hunt. Many people love these random scenes that appear throughout the film, but I do not. They're alright, but not very funny; the gofer belongs in a child-marketed PG-rated film, not an R-rated adult comedy.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is not a bad film; it is just not a very good one. As a comedy it delivers enough laughs to recommend. It's hardly an offensive comedy (although it does have some profane language and scatological references) and will keep you entertained. Just don't expect another Animal House."

It's one of those 80s comedies that thinks very crude humor and destruction is hilarious. There's also a dull dramatic back story with Michael O'Keefe as a caddy trying to get to college.<br/><br/>I remember this being pretty funny back in 1980--it hasn't aged well at all.<br/><br/>The humor is pretty disgusting and totally unfunny (especially a sequence involving a Baby Ruth candy bar). Murray is just horrible as the grounds keeper--not even remotely funny, just dull. Also the gopher he's chasing is shown by one of the stupidest puppets I've ever seen.

","RELEASED IN 1980 and directed by Harold Ramis, ""Caddyshack"" is a comedy about a high-class golf course that has to deal with a colorful new member (Rodney Dangerfield) and a destructive dancing gopher. Ted Knight and Chevy Chase play high society golfers while Bill Murray plays the half-mad assistant greenskeeper in charge of taking out the menacing gopher. Michael O'Keefe and Scott Colomby appear as young caddies while Cindy Morgan and Sarah Holcomb are featured in the female department.<br/><br/>This is a fun movie with a classic cast, a kinetic soundtrack (e.g. Kenny Loggins) and a can't-beat-it late 70s/early 80's ambiance. Both Dangerfield and Knight are over-the-top. They're more entertaining than funny though. Chase plays it more low-key while Murray is decidedly bizarre. Morgan shines in her most famous role, but don't expect much more on the female front. The gopher steals the show. <br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 98 minutes and was shot in Florida (Davie, Boca Ratan, Fort Lauderdale & Key Biscayne) and the Los Angeles area (e.g. Woodland Hills Country Club).

","And also one in which Murray has already problems with small, kind furry burrowers <br/><br/>I pick this one thinking that having in the same picture, Chevy, Murray and Ramis should be great and if it's indeed the result, the previous meeting is a bit disappointing and Chevy is not that funny here! On the other hand, Murray is really good playing a bit the future groundskeeper Willie from the Simpsons! In addition, I'm amazed to see that his brother looks then like his twin, as much physically as with his attitudes! <br/><br/>Beyond the duo, this is a fine comedy that actually makes laugh, a genre that has disappeared from today American screens and this movie is easy to understand why While America has always denied social classes, claiming that everyone is equal but some are motivated (the rich) while others are lazy (the poor), this movie clearly illustrates that there are indeed 2 different worlds: the privileged one and the one of the common people.. So here the entire movie is about a very select, elitist golf club and while the rich play or fight as hobbies, the poor are actually working as their helping hands So because there is no better sharp contrast that this one, the movie sure finds a lot of interesting characters and things to do! In addition, the movie has still the look, the coolness of the 70s and again, the difference with today is clear! Maybe the movie loses a bit of its quality during the last holes, but it's still refreshing and fun to watch!"

","Caddyshack is easily the funniest movie out there. From it's hilarious cast to it's many quotable moments, Caddyshack will laughing even after your 10th and counting viewing. Chevy Chase and Bill Murray are quite the comedians but they aren't the star clowns in this circus. The 2 comedians who really make the film memorable are Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight. Nothing is funnier then seeing Rodney Dangerfield annoy Ted Knight to death throughout the movie. Whether it be when Rodney wrecks Ted's new boat or when he beats Ted in the golf tournament thanks to a well timed attempted gopher termination. Now don't get me wrong, the Tom and Jerry like humor of Bill Murray and the gopher is very funny and Chevy Chase is a pretty funny guy, but Rodney Dangerfield is the king of comedy. Rest in peace in Jewish heaven Rodney. Caddyshack may not have been the most successful upon release in the 80's but today it is a classic. If you haven't seen Caddyshack yet, well that's just inconceivable."

","You mention ""Caddyshack"" and you're talking about one of the great '80s comedies. Its humor ranging from sexy to scatological, this is some finely-tuned lowbrow material. And it just works. What's funny is that this is supposed to be Michael O'Keefe's story, but the movie's hijacked by the comic veterans (Chase, Dangerfield and Murray). The real brilliance of this movie is seeing the ad-lib ripcord being pulled on Bill Murray and watching him go. That stuff about the Dalai Lama is gold! The cake's icing is the lovely (and nude) Cindy Williams, not to mention the gopher.

He attempts to make an association with Judge Smails, the opinionated, bombastic president of the club, played by Ted Knight, but that goes nowhere quickly. Bushwood appears to be invaded by gophers, the Judge wants them done away with, and the owner of the lumber yard that's causing them to invade the grounds, to also be dealt with. Al Czervik,played to the hilt by Rodney Dangerfield, intends to combat the Judge, and every attempt is made to rudely cast aspirations about the others' character, etc. Bill Murray plays the grounds keeper, Carl, and from there, the laughs continue to mount. Chevy Chase has the role of Ty Webb, the golf wiz at the club, and he performs in his usual, comedic pointed style.<br/><br/>One episode leads to another, with the combatants, The Judge, a Dr. Beeper, paired in an on course golf match against Al and Ty. Al injures his elbow, and Danny has to pick up the match, play to win, which cancels out his chances at the Bushwood golf scholarship. To top off this match, Carl is going to attempt to exterminate the gopher, even if it blows the club off the map.<br/><br/>It's on to the links, and just sit back and enjoy the laugh filled film.

","Caddyshack for the most part is a funny screwball comedy that began the train ride of comedies that would highlight the 1980s. I am not too fond of golf so actually enjoying the film came as a surprise to me. Some jokes just tried to hard, but other jokes had me laughing through the roof. My favorites are the gopher scenes and the scene spoofing Jaws with a candy bar in the pool.<br/><br/>Harold Ramis's film has many subplots to the story. There is Danny, a caddy for a golf course who wants to go to college so he tries to win a scholarship. There is the assistant groundskeeper named Carl who tries to eliminate a gopher. There is a new member named Al who is crazy and constantly angers one of the founders, Judge Smails. There is also this talented golfer named Ty, who Danny regularly caddies for.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good I think. Chevy Chase did a swell job as Ty. Laid-back, but pretty funny. Rodney Dangerfield was hilarious as Al. Michael O'Keefe was pretty good as Danny. I thought Bill Murray was the highlight as the man trying to kill the gopher without such luck.<br/><br/>Overall, Caddyshack is actually a pretty good film. There are more funny moments than not, although not every joke works. It works as a good sports spoof and I'm just glad it's not a straight-up golf movie. This movie is heralded as a cult classic and I can see why. This film almost works as a stand-up comedy show, which is not bad at all. I rate this film 8/10."

","I just watched this movie again last night. I keep forgetting this film gets better with age. It's been 34 years since it debuted in 1980. The first time I saw it I was very young, about 10. I watched it on T.V. of course it was cut; but you never forget your 1st comedy. I can't say anything negative about this film. The cast, plot, and scenery are-flawless. The movie begins on a plush golf course(Bushwood). It takes place in Nebraska, but the filming is done mostly in and around the Boca Raton area-Florida. You can tell this when we go to the yacht club in the movie. The movie begins where the viewer is introduced to this beautiful golf course in the morning. The sprinklers are on, and this gopher is tearing up the coarse. We also hear the song I'm All Right, by Kenny Loggins playing. The camera cuts and to a house in the city. The Noonan home, it is full of kids, and rowdy as ever. Danny (Micheal O'Keefe) is the oldest and is a caddy at Bushwood. His parents make sure most of his money, including his tips go into a jar, the college fund. Once he talks to his father; and eats breakfast he is off to work at Bushwood. Once at Bushwood we are introduced to the rest of the rowdy crew. Mel Loomis(Brian Doyle Murray) is the boss; and is perfect for the role. He is the straight boss that is cool; and if he likes you will let things slide. He is also one that likes to slack on the rules and you will notice that during the end of the film. Bill Murray(Carl Spackler) is a man on a mission. He is the Assistant Grounds Keeper. Carl is responsible for getting rid of this gopher. He tries everything, water down the holes, changing holes, and shooting it. Also in the movie are Ted Knight( Judge Smails), Rodney Dangerfield( Czervik), and Chevy Chase(TY), to name a few. The movie is about a Danny, who as a caddy needs a scholarship to help his parents pay for his college. Noonan tries to suck up to Judge Smails, for the caddy scholarship. We are then introduced to Rodney Dangerfield(Czervik). Who is a condo builder and his building just across from Bushwood. He is very funny and very obnoxious. As soon as he arrives, he and Smails get into it. Once the two are on the course Czervik bets him on everything when it comes to golf. Judge Smails soon realizes Czervik is his nemesis and a menace to the game of golf. Danny is a great caddy; and bonds with Ty. The two become quick friends, and Danny asks and takes Ty's advice when it comes to golf. The annual Caddy tournament is here and Danny wins first place. As the movie goes along Czervik and Smails get a bet going that gets up to 80 thousand dollars. Once the coarse hears about it, the bets are on. Ty hopes Danny will be his caddy, but draws Smails instead. As the game proceeds Ty realizes Czervik sucks at golf. It is time for a new plan, Czervik shoots his ball so the ball will come back a hit him right in the arm. Ty is down a partner and decides to draw Danny. Judge Smails looks at him for a decision, and Danny excepts Ty's offer. There goes the Caddy scholarship, but if Ty and Danny pull it off, he will not need it. As the game proceeds Ty and Danny tie it up. It comes down to the 18 hole and the pressure is on. Ty looks at Danny and says don't worry if you miss we lose. Danny shot comes up short, and Smails and the Doc. think they have it in the bag. The ball is on the very tip; and ready to drop. Just when the game should be over, but Lou keeps watching that ball. All of a sudden Carl uses the dynamite on the gopher. The ball drops into the hole, Ty and Danny get their revenge Smails. It's a party at Bushwood due to the outcome; but Carl doesn't get the gopher in the end. This movie has it all, Golf, The Murray brothers, big laughs, fun at the pool; and some hanky panky. It is a non-stop laugh-a-thon. If this movie doesn't bring a smile and laughs to you; please check your pulse. THX, Kris L. CocKayne"

Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea. It's not funny and the actors look bored. You'll be bored. Chase is awful and looks silly. Still, I thought this was cute and not bad. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them."
"belknapp-jami","8","0","1","24 September 2013"," Caddyshack: The genius of Harold Ramis
","The great comedy produced in Caddyshack can be found laughable by anyone, regardless of their golf expertise. The star-studded cast, lead by the likes of Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, and Ted Knight, excellently meshes to form the great underdog story of Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe). Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) perfectly fits the typical country club hot-shot but oddly enough, is one of the most likable figures due to his generosity and fun-going personality. His nemesis in the film is the cheap and uptight Judge Smails (Ted Knight) who tries to encourage young Danny Noonan to go for the esteemed caddy scholarship. What truly makes the film a classic is the slew of one-line jokes, supported by a tremendous cast, excellent originality, and admirable animations, which are easily able to recite and hilarious in many different settings.<br/><br/>Caddyshack can be better thought of as many small movies put together, never really developing a plot but instead, letting the actors' brilliance control the true comedy. In this case, it really worked. Director Harold Ramis uses Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield's hilarious antics combined with Chevy Chase's laid-back, lovable nature to keep the dull moments few and far between. The way Ramis gives each individual character their own time to shine makes them all likable and gives the urge to experience more with each and every one. This phenomenal cast leaves you looking for a sequel, or at least to be a part of the typical, and at the same time hysterical, day at Bushwood Country Club.<br/><br/>The film's originality draws you into new territory in the comedy world. No other film of its kind previously chartered the waters of pure amusement at a relatively serious setting, Bushwood Country Club. On any given day, one can find the slob groundskeeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) using extreme tactics such as dynamite to take down the likes of the ""enemy varmint gopher"" or a slew of Al Czervik's caddies watching television from the side of his enormous golf bag right in the middle of the fairway.<br/><br/>Being from 1980 and not having the same technological capabilities of our modern era, the movie excels in the animations department. Some action scenes are even ahead of their time, including the fire shooting through the gophers' hole as it tries to frantically escape the blaze set off by the crazy groundskeeper Carl Spackler. Another includes Al Czervik using a video game like putter to automatically make shots. Both of which produce laughs that will last for days.<br/><br/>Ramis' genius script includes the one-liners that can be laughed at in almost any setting. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) is the master of this; ""don't sell yourself short judge, you're a tremendous slouch"". Lines like this and others such as Al Czervik's ""he called me a baboon, he thinks I'm his wife"" can be funny regardless of context, but when put in action by the characters and their individual interactions, they become hysterical. For what Ramis intended, a movie designed to make people laugh, he greatly excelled in delivering a comedy on a level all of its own."

","When I think of 80's comedies I usually think about movies like "" Police academy"" , ""Trading places"" , ""Back to school "" , "" National lampoons vacation"" , ""Beverly Hills cop"" or ""Ghostbusters"" . Somehow I didn't got to see ""Caddyshack"" until last year. This movie has been called on of the greatest comedy movies of 80's and beyond. To be honest I think the movie is a little bit overrated ( probably because of the cult status it has). I didn't enjoyed it as much as I expected . I would rather watch one more time one of the movies I've mentioned above.<br/><br/>It doesn't mean I don't like the movie at all. The problem for me is that a lot of the jokes fall flat. There is plenty of ""low"" humor , over-the-top humor and at times also quite vulgar humor. I think I like a little bit more sophisticated humor. On the other hand I like the fact that this movie is not politically correct . I laughed hard at some of the jokes that will be probably offensive to other people ( For example – Rodney Dangerfield tells his Asian friend "" This is a rather exclusive club , so don't tell anyone that you're a Jew"" ) . The parody of ""Jaws "" is priceless. Gunga Allunga. Overall , I had good time , but it's not necessarily my type of comedy.<br/><br/>There is also a little problem with the screenplay. Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is supposed to be the main hero of the movie , yet he ends as a supporting character. He isn't even on the movie poster ! There is a love story between him and Maggie (Sarah Holcomb) that I've found rather boring and unnecessary . One could wonder wouldn't it be better for the movie to get rid of his character . Most of the jokes are otherwise provided by the so-called supporting characters that obviously and easily steal the whole show. I like the fact that the movie feels improvised , but the writers should make the story a little bit more focused.<br/><br/>Acting is definitively a strong side of ""Caddyshack"" . Chevy Chase , Bill Murray , Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight – each one of these actors fits his role PERFECTLY. All those characters are very charismatic and memorable. Chase plays Ty Webb - a rich and lazy guy with a Zen philosophy of life. Dangerfield plays Al Czervik – obnoxious , rich businessman from Czech Republic who's got no taste whatsoever. Murray plays Carl Spackler – retarded gardener who's trying to kill pesky ( but cute) gopher . Oh , by the way the obviously mechanic gopher was created by George Lucas. Last but not least Knight plays Judge Smails – hysterical and arrogant owner of the golf club. Other actors also give fine performances. It was also good to see Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall) naked.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great . Kenny Loggins songs are catchy , especially the main song – "" I'm alright "" . Other artists are : Eddie Cochran ""Summertime blues"" ,Earth Wind and Fire"" Boogie Wonderland"" , Hilly Michaels ""Something on your mind"" , Journey ""Any way you want it "", The Paul Collins Beat ""There she goes"" , Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ""Waltz of the Flowers - Nutcracker Ballet"" and Bill Murray (!)""Ballad of the Green Berets"". All those songs are great as well. The original music made by Johnny Mandel is very jazzy and nice. The musical scenes are beautifully choreographed and the music is excellent.<br/><br/>This movie is better than any movie mad by Adam Sandler or Farrelly brothers , but I like other 80's comedies better. Still , if you like this type of humor you will probably enjoy yourself. I give it 8/10."

","This directorial debut from Ghostbusters writer/star Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Bedazzled) I had heard about and knew one of the stars, and I knew it involved golf, so I decided to give it a go. Basically at Bushwood Country Club is a popular exclusive golf course, and it is there that we see numerous workers and players on the course getting up to all sorts of antics. All the members who play are mostly wealthy, and many eccentric as well, it is only most of the staff, especially the younger ones, who are slightly less eccentric and obviously less well off. The characters include Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight) who is being constantly irritated by very rude and always chirpy millionaire Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) who wants to buy Bushwood. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), another big shot player on the course is meanwhile just pining around as a friend of Judge, and with the conflicts going on they are all giving young caddy Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) ideas of where he should go in life. Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) is the near brainless psychopathic grounds keeper who has been given the task of eliminating all gophers who are digging around ruining the course, and he is going to great lengths to destroy them, such as pumping water through the holes, using a gun, and even explosives. The conflict between Judge and Al gets so bad that they decide to settle their differences once and for all with a match to win their right to own the club all together, to which, after explosions rumble, Al is the winner, and with the help of bruisers does get the deal done. Also starring Sarah Holcomb as Maggie O'Hooligan, Scott Colomby as Tony D'Annunzio, Cindy Morgan as Lacey Underall and Dan Resin as Dr. Beeper. I agree with the critics that the small teenage subplot is pointless and was probably only put in to draw that age audience, but Dangerfield creates an amusingly vulgar persona, Knight gets his time as his rival, Chase doesn't really do anything, and Murray steals the show creating a completely different character to his usual sorts, being the thick Elmer Fudd type hunter trying to catch the lovable pest gopher. The writing for most of the jokes is good enough, I did find enjoyment watching the chocolate bar in the swimming pool mistaken for excrement, and of course all the dangerous antics of Murray, and some of the golf playing is okay too, so while it is not all original, there are moments to like in this comedy. ""Cinderella story. Outta nowhere. A former greenskeeper, now, about to become the Masters champion. It looks like a mirac...It's in the hole! It's in the hole!

","More than thirty years after its initial release Caddyshack is now regarded as a comedy classic. People know it, love it, quote it. But does anyone even remember what this movie is actually about? It's the story of young caddy Danny Noonan, played by Michael O'Keefe, who is trying to finagle his way into a caddy scholarship for college by kissing the proper behinds. But all these years later nobody ever mentions poor O'Keefe or his character when they talk about this movie. Because Rodney Dangerfield stole the show. Or maybe Bill Murray stole the show. And wait, there's Chevy Chase too. Poor O'Keefe never stood a chance. His character may have been at the center of the movie's story but this is not a movie about story. This is a movie about laughs. And with Dangerfield, Murray and Chase involved there are certainly plenty of laughs to go around.<br/><br/>So when looking back on this movie you don't focus on the story. You just think of your favorite moments. For many people the majority of those moments seem to revolve around Murray's character of grounds keeper Carl Spackler, a simple man who has total consciousness awaiting him on his deathbed. There's that Dalai Lama bit. There's his wonderful ""Cinderella story"". There's his swimming pool snack. And there's the one scene Murray's Carl shares with Chase's Ty Webb, two comic geniuses in a brilliant back-and-forth. Chase's character is more or less a reserved straight man in the movie though he definitely gets his zingers in too. Not at all reserved is the outrageous Dangerfield who holds nothing back with his blustery, scenery-chewing performance. He'll do or say anything for a laugh. Dangerfield's character of Al Czervik has a lack of tact and good grace which really gets under the skin of Judge Smails, played wonderfully by Ted Knight. The stodgy judge could use a proper nemesis and in the outlandish Al Czervik he more than meets his match. All the good stuff from Murray and Chase and Dangerfield and Knight overshadows O'Keefe. Heck, poor O'Keefe even gets overshadowed by a gopher. The movie may be nominally about young Danny Noonan but it seems that director Harold Ramis knew the big laughs would come from elsewhere and just let the rest of his cast go nuts and do what they do best. And it works terrifically. Yes, some of the jokes and gags fall a little flat. The movie has some fits and starts, doesn't consistently keep up the laughs all the way through. But when it hits it hits big and all in all there are more than enough laughs to cover up a few rough spots. Maybe the movie could have done with just a little bit more attention paid to its actual story. And there are some other characters floating about we might have liked to have spent a little more time with. For instance Cindy Morgan, playing the stunning temptress Lacey Underall, could have been given more to do. In this movie where story is left on the back burner it's really all about everyone in the cast making the most of their respective moments. And everyone does. Even the gopher."

","I finally got around to seeing this well-known comedy classic. It turns out the whole Murray-vs-animatronic-gopher thing is only a small fraction of the overall comedy, which was interesting because actually the movie skips and hops over various different comedic forms on purpose, providing a somewhat well rounded, somewhat flawed sketch comedy.<br/><br/>Bill Murray is the foul-mouthed, creepy groundskeeper presenting some of the gross-out comedy. Rodney Dangerfield is Al Czervick, successful realty investor, mixes things up with the characters with his screwball comedy. Chevy Chase is the dry-humored zen golfer. Ted Knight is ""Caddyshack""'s attempt at making fun of The Man. Michael O'Keefe is the young kid providing the movie some character to get behind, and Cindy Morgan plays Lacey Underall (nice name, right?), the sex comedy aspect of the movie. They meet and play golf. There are fights, bets, gunfire, and explosions.<br/><br/>I don't think ""Caddyshack"" has aged all that well over time. Sexed up raunchy comedy has just gotten dirtier over the years, leaving most of ""Caddyshack"" behind in the dust. The story doesn't flow all too well, trudging along scene by scene and often getting distracted by some other anecdote to tell. Each character seems kind of like they came out of their own comedy and were lumped together for a ""best of"" skit. However, some of the more drab and dry comedy, especially coming from Chevy Chase as Ty, but also with the attempts of young Danny to get the Judge's attentions for a future he doesn't even want, not only hold up well but give this movie legs to last a bit longer. I can't say it has all that much rewatchability, though.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","It's hard to believe that it took me 25 years to get around to seeing ""Caddyshack"", and only because I am scheduled to caddy next week for the Spirit International amateur golf championships. I need to see how it is done!<br/><br/>There are several stories going on. One is Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) who is the best golfer in the club but has dropped out of competitive golf and doesn't even keep score anymore. But ask his caddy, and he'll tell you Ty probably shot a 65 or 66 his last time out.<br/><br/>Then there is the loud, obnoxious Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield in a great performance), a businessman who has the largest and heaviest golf bag in the sport, who doesn't shy away from talking loudly while someone is preparing to make a stroke, and who eggs others into a match for $$Thousands.<br/><br/>Then there is the issue of the little critters that are digging up the golf course, and dim-witted maintenance guy Carl (Bill Murray) is given the order to get rid of them. His efforts end up virtually destroying the golf course.<br/><br/>Overall a funny movie, but I would not put it up there with the best comedies of all time. More of a curiosity for the characters."

Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, Bill Murray, and Rodney Dangerfield are just hilarious.<br/><br/>And you gotta love that gopher.<br/><br/>Bill Murray steals the show as Carl, the groundskeeper who wages World War III on a gopher who is causing damage to a golf course.

One thing i don't miss about the late seventies and eighties. I think that if it wasn't for Bill Murray (which i love) the movie would get a 4. And if it wasn't for Chevy Chase, i would rate this movie 3. But since they both are in it and they do a great job, this movie gets an 5.

","Well, the second straight movie I've seen with Cindy Morgan, although here she brings a much more spicier performance unlike what she did in Tron.<br/><br/>Some people think Caddyshack is one of the best comedies ever made, others think it's highly over-rated. I'm in the middle; it's a good one, but not one of the best ever. It could have been a lot better, though.<br/><br/>Caddyshack is pretty much about the adventures of several people over at the Bushwood Golf And Country Club. The main character is Michael O'Keefe's Danny, a caddy at the club. His unreal week at the club is the setting for some really wacky characters.<br/><br/>The star of this movie is Rodney Dangerfield's Al Czervik whose pastiche of double entendres are hilarious. He delivers them non-stop. Ted Knight's Judge Smails is another great character, playing the straight laced chairman of Bushwood. He was a gas. Miss Morgan also delivers something nice for the males to see. There's also the gopher going around wreaking havoc on the golf course; what a cute, endearing little critter he is.<br/><br/>Sadly, the Video Movie Guide was right about Chevy Chase and Bill Murray being wasted. Chase is forced to play a bland, inanimate character that's stuck in a straight jacket. Murray is Carl Spackler, who spends most of the film trying to kill the gopher and sounds like he's the third McKenzie brother from SCTV (Harold Ramis, a SCTV alumni, probably made Murray's character as such, since he was a co-writer of the film). Still, they make the best of what they had.<br/><br/>All in all, this isn't bad and IT IS one the best sports movies ever made, but don't expect greatness. It's still worth a viewing on DVD and yes, the great lines, the hilarious bedroom scene featuring O'Keefe, Morgan and Knight, and the Kenny Loggins music helps."

","I took my bike to the video store. after a while i decided between ""deconstructing harry"" and ""caddyshack"" (kirstie alley vs. chevy chase). i chose chevy chase because (i think) he's one of my favorite comedians and because kirstie alley is the opposite (although i didn't know how much influence she would have on deconstructing harry).<br/><br/>after i had started watching ""caddyshack"" i soon thougt that maybe it would've been better if i had chosen the allen-film. maybe it wouldn't have been so bad with a bit of kirstie alley and tobey maguire. because caddyshack is a not so good film.<br/><br/>sure, i laughed a couple of times. the funniest things involved a squirrel and a chocolate bar mistaken for a turd, which says awfully much about the film. but i can't help laughing at chevy chase. there's just something about him.<br/><br/>the rest of the acting crew were a bunch loud-screaming, pretty annoying people, except for bill murray (who wasn't that funny either) and one of those women who seem to always have to show their breasts in chevy chase movies, it's funny how often it happens.<br/><br/>it wasn't even that much about golf, not that it mattered. there were a bunch of weird scenes, that you couldn't laugh at, but still found pretty, yeah, weird or whatever. and you get a lot of 80's music. it's always a special feeling nowadays.<br/><br/>but if you wanna see a chevy chase film, i'd go for ""fletch"" and also ""fletch lives"". or ""vacation"". after that maybe you can see ""caddyshack"". or that way you'll get a bit disappointed. so after all it's maybe better to start with this one and feel the quality rise while watching ""fletch"" and the other ones."

","CADDYSHACK (1980) **** Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Ted Knight, Rodney Dangerfield, Michael O' Keefe, Brian Doyle-Murray.  Hysterical comedy of hijinks on the links with misfits and buffoons mixing it up with golf, sex and wild slapstick, Dangerfield is a scream and nobody does a better burn than Knight.  Director Harold Ramis wisely lets Murray steal the show as his scruffy, zonked out groundskeeper Carl either after his gopher prey or lecturing a caddy about his stint with The Dalhi Llama: gunga - ga - loonga!!"

"Bill Slocum","7","0","4","12 November 2002"," Good, but no classic
","It's funny how it works out. When the Brits come up with a story about class conflict and the virtues of staying true to oneself, they come up with ""Great Expectations."" Instead, we come up with this.<br/><br/>I like ""Caddyshack,"" sometimes quite a bit. But I don't love it, and that puts me in the minority. It's a film that has improved with age, not so much because the years have revealed hidden layers but because its fans tend to amplify every minor joke in it to the point of a cultural touchstone. A writer at ESPN.com, The Sports Guy, has a Mecca-like attraction to the film, and actually excerpted a series of ""Caddyshack"" quotes to help preview the NFL 2002 season. And made it into a two-parter, to boot. I love the Sports Guy; I just wish the film bothered to displaythat same level of ingeniousness.<br/><br/>Part of my problem is I'm rooting too much for Ted Knight, even though I know I'm not supposed to. Everyone else acts so reflexively cynical, but Judge Smails has an endearing innocence about him. Just check out that way he laughs. When he holes that putt with Billy Baru, I just want to leap out of my seat and holler, until I realize what happens next. Knight's performance is great because he lets you in.<br/><br/>Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield are good, and that's all. They have funny lines, and fun characters, but either they or the script kind of leave them in neutral much of the time. Dangerfield's Czervik kind of grates, while Murray's Carl Spackler just makes me think of Brian Wilson after a while, and his failure to interact with anyone else in the case kind of leaves him lost in space.<br/><br/>I like Chevy Chase in this movie, more than a little. This and ""Funny Farm"" were the only two films of his I've seen where he bothered to actually play a character, and Ty Webb is an interesting one. Of the privileged class yet endearingly an outsider, Ty seems entangled by his circumstances (the writer didn't pull his name out of a phone book), and wanting something more, something real, something he knows is not his to get: ""Danny, I'm a vegg."" The way he looks at Cindy Morgan's Lacey Underall and says ""Let's pretend for a moment we're two real human beings,"" is almost heartbreaking when you really notice it. On the pure funny side, well, you have his putting (""na-na-na-na"") and his evening drop-by at Carl's bachelor pad. Plus he gets all the best lines (""That's what they said about Son of Sam."")<br/><br/>But there's so much dead space in this one, too much gratuitious nonsense. The whole Danny Noonan thing is wasted, and it's only the main plot. His girlfriend's annoying, Brian Doyle-Murray should have stayed behind the typewriter, and the whole slobs-vs-snobs thing feels too tacked on and manipulatively rigged. When the caddies crash the pool, you are supposed to root for them, and want to, but they are just too obnoxious. People who love ""Caddyshack,"" absolutely love it, are the same kind of people who think it's funny to stick their chewing gum in someone else's catheter.<br/><br/>Anyone else notice the horn on Al Czervik's boat makes the same sound as the one in his car?"
"LaChantefleurie","Null","0","1","16 September 2002"," Mixed reviews, mixed opinion
","Yes, this movie is vulgar and disgusting (and has nudity that is COMPLETELY unnecessary and has NOTHING to do with anything!). But I really did laugh at many of the jokes. Believe it or not, Chevy Chase is funny in this movie (how old is this, anyway?) and the absolutely w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l Bill Murray is a gophericide (??) obsessed groundskeeper who is in a permanent state of drug-induced stupor, and very funny while he's at it! Rodney Dangerfied is his usual obnoxious self, and I've never seen a movie with him in which I liked his acting. And the girl, the appropriately named Lacey Underall, was stuck in the movie last-minute to capture the drooling male contigent, and it shows how extraneous her part is from the rest of the movie. Oh, and the star Danny Noonan? Forgot about him every time he wasn't actually onscreen. Why WAS he there anyway?<br/><br/>So, this is an okay comedy with some good gags, and I can see how many people would love it (so don't kill me!) but it's certainly not my cup of tea. Involving burrowing rodents...why not watch a movie with a groundhog instead of a gopher? Groundhog Day...now THAT's a comedy.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5"

","Zany events take place in and around an exclusive golf course. I like this film for 3 things only- Rodney, Rodney and Rodney. He takes every opportunity he gets to crack a one-liner: ""He called me a baboon, thinks I'm his wife"". You're just waiting for Dangerfield to come on again just so the film can pick up.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with Bill Murray, while I understand hardcore 'shack fans loved him in this role, I didn't. He's a DEADPAN comedian, his scenes especially were just silly and dumb. Which might have been alright if they were funny. I loved Bill Murray in Ghostbusters, but to see him stoop this low, trying to make a joke out of hunting a gopher, was embarrassing.<br/><br/>My advice would be to just fast forward to the scenes that have Dangerfield or the Judge (the late Ted Knight) in them. There the only two guys in this film who get my respect!"

","I have seen this movie numerous times, and each time I laugh just as loud at the same stupid lines that I did before. Although Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase(I'm not usually a big fan of his, but he rocks here)and Ted Knight(one of the best comedic actors of his time, in my opinion) are hysterical, the movie really belongs to Bill Murray. The scene where he and the priest are out playing golf in the monsoon-because the good lord wouldn't rain on the best game of the father's life-is one of the funniest I've ever seen, and the thought of the goofy groundskeeper asking the Dalai Lama for a tip is making me laugh right now (""So I said, hey, Lama, how about something for the effort?"")Even 22 years later, the script (if not the 'dos) is timeless.If you haven't seen it, please do so immediately.

"tommythek","7","0","2","2 November 2001"," The best ever? Duh .....
","I FINALLY got around to watching this movie in its entirety. I'd seen bits and pieces of it over the years but never the whole thing all at once. Proud of being the snob that I am, I always considered ""Caddyshack"" to be about 20 floors beneath my cultured dignity.<br/><br/>Having seen it, I now have come to IMDb to vote on it and to comment on it. I've noticed, first, that a few commenters think this is the best movie ever made. Or, at the very least, the best COMEDY ever made. Conversely, 6,262 voters (to date, counting me) rate this movie at only 6.9 out of 10. Which means that the ""silent majority"" think ""Caddyshack"" is just an OK movie. And I'm with the latter group. ""Caddyshack"" does have its moments, a few of them quite funny, but overall, it's just OK.<br/><br/>Let's face it. There are only four people in this movie: Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. All the other actors and actresses who are in it, young and old alike, are thrown in just to fill in empty holes in the screen. Or to say something when all of The Big Four are debating among themselves as to who has the next one-liner. And usually it's Dangerfield, who tosses out one-liners as if he's throwing rice at a wedding. Most people would probably say his character (Al Czervik) is the funniest in this movie. Not say me. My vote goes to Bill Murray (Carl Spackler -- what a name!), who plays an absolutely insane assistant keeper of the greensward at the uppity Bushwood Country Club. This guy couldn't get a clue if Vanna White herself were handing them out for free, which makes his character all the more lovable in this movie.<br/><br/>There is one classic scene where Chevy Chase (Ty Webb), in preparation for an important match upcoming with the snooty Judge Smails (Ted Knight), is working on his golf game -- in the middle of the night! He accidentally knocks his ball into Spackler's -- uh -- ""living quarters."" In the course of attempting to get Spackler's permission to ""play thru,"" the two of them have the most inane conversation you could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>I can imagine that Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill's brother), Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney, the three co-writers, must have had great fun writing the script (such as it is) for this movie. I can picture the three of them, in many late-night writing sessions, trying to top each other's one-liners -- and the more lowbrow the one-liners, the better.<br/><br/>Though the movie does have, as I've said, some funny lines and scenes, it is mostly just a ""cut-and-run"" from one scene to the next -- unrelated -- gag or scene. If one appreciates a COMPLETE movie of this type -- and from this era (1980ish, give or take a few) -- one would do much better with the likes of ""Animal House,"" ""Airplane"" or ""Ghostbusters.""<br/><br/>Don't forget! ""Caddyshack"" is the type of movie that attracts those people who are attracted to the lowbrow in almost anything. The ""Best Ever"" movie? No. The ""Best Comedy Ever""? I don't think so. Remember, those members of the cultured intelligentsia, such as myself, rarely stoop to the level of a ""Caddyshack."" It really is beneath us. But if one does so stoop, one will actually find a few laughs therein. What a surprise!"

Al is the most obnoxious individual I've ever seen and I loved the character! Dangerfield excels at delivering one-liner insults to everyone in the film. One of the tragedies in the film is the role played by Chevy Chase as Ty. Ty could have been left out of the film entirely and no one would have noticed. This was a waste of talent.
