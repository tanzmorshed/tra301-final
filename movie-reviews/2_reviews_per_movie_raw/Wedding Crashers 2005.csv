"ivko","8","125","166","24 August 2005"," Excellent summer movie
","This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend."
"Rooster99","8","56","75","16 June 2006"," This movie was hilarious
","An excellent comedy, Vince Vaughn is a gifted comedian. He kept ""Old School"" going, was the only light in a dismal ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and had a terrific debut lead in ""Swingers"". I highly recommend people considering this movie, to watch the extras on the DVD; there is a karaoke scene at an Asian wedding which will have you rolling. It is a shame it was cut from the movie, but as the director's comments stated, ""They just couldn't find a place where it would fit."" I was very pleasantly surprised at the number of times I laughed out loud, a rarity for me while watching comedies. The lines were witty, the delivery was crisp, and the jokes were mostly new and fresh. Rachel McAdams was stunning, an excellent casting choice to play the object of Owen Wilson's desire. Despite the more or less rehashed plot (two guys lie about themselves to meet women, only to find that they now have a dilemma when they find 2 they really like), the film is nonetheless novel and original. There are a number of obviously stereotypical characters, (drunken grandmother, artistic introverted son, psychotic cheating boyfriend, immoral mother, powerful father), but they work in this film. Particularly the grandmother, who is prone to drunken scatological exclamations, had me laughing my head off. It was quite unexpected.<br/><br/>Although many of the situations could come off as contrived, they were secondary to the excellent repartee between Wilson and Vaughn. Their comic pairing worked to a T.<br/><br/>R."
"botner","10","300","442","26 June 2005"," Witty, raunchy and sure to become a 'classic'
","Saw a advance screening of this on Friday night. Hilarious doesn't do the film justice. You know how in most films you remember the funniest parts and bring them up as you leave the theater? This one, it's hard to remember the best parts because there's so many of them.<br/><br/>Unlike his previous films, where Vince Vaughn is usually reduced to the role of 'scene stealer', here we get a full dose of Babaganush, and he's in his finest form since 'Swingers'. If you liked him in his Swingers/Made persona, you'll love him here. Some of the riffs that he has literally will have you holding your sides with laughter.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson. You either like him or you don't. He's more of the straight man in this film, although he does have some pretty good lines too, and he has great chemistry with Vaughn, especially in the scenes where they're fighting. He's the ying to Vaughn's yang.<br/><br/>The movie certainly 'earns' it's R rating. There's a healthy dose of nudity, sex related hijinks, and f-bombs. But it's not 'gross out' humor a la American Pie. It pushes boundaries, but not just in a 'shock value' way. It's genuinely funny.<br/><br/>I saw the movie with a bunch of critics, who usually the jaded type, were laughing their asses of as well. Guys will love this movie and will be quoting it for the rest of the year. Girls will love it too though, and there is a romantic subplot (cheesy at times, but forgivable given how funny the movie is), with Rachael McAdams doing a great job as Owen Wilson's love interest. Isla Fischer plays the role of 'scene stealer' in this one, serving as Vince Vaughn's psycho love interest. And Chris Walken is Chris Walken.<br/><br/>So overall..inappropriate, hilarious and glorious. Better than Oldschool. Way better than Anchorman. Best comedy of the year, maybe the last couple of years."
"jvydelingum","8","215","323","2 July 2005"," Wilson and Vaughn: The Perfect Couple?
","The Frat-Pack, are surely the hardest working collective in Hollywood. Hardly a month goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released.<br/><br/>When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodgeball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but ""Wedding Crashers"" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.<br/><br/>Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. In ""Wedding Crashers"", John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn), are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food.. and of course score with girls.<br/><br/>They have a strict 'crashers rulebook', which dictates the etiquette of the pick-up, such as 'never use your real name'. It also suggests, by behaving raucously, loudly and generally being the life-and-soul, people will think you're so obnoxious, you can't not have been invited.<br/><br/>The pair eventually find themselves at odds with each other when John meets and falls for a bridesmaid at the Washington society wedding of the year.<br/><br/>Although ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com cliché. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former ""Home and Away"" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.<br/><br/>I admit ""Wedding Crashers"" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fiancée Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.<br/><br/>But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film. 8/10"
"seamus_waldron-1","9","130","207","5 July 2005"," I laughed so much, I cried too. Fun buddy movie of two friends who crash weddings to meet girls.
","This could have been a shocking buddy movie, but the writing, the comedic performances and the simple concept, make this my favourite comedy of the year.<br/><br/>Divorce mediators John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are business partners and longtime friends who share a strange hobby, crashing weddings.<br/><br/>With intricate planning of back stories, the pair crash Jewish, Itaian, Irish, Chinese, even Hindu weddings, always with an answer for that question of ""And you are"".?<br/><br/>Wedding crashing has rules, handed down from one generation to the next :<br/><br/>""Invites are for losers"", ""Make sure she's single"", ""Never use your real name"", ""Dance like you mean it"", ""Free drinks, why not?"", ""If you can't cry, fake it!"" and the most important; ""Never leave a fellow crasher behind""<br/><br/>Though a kaleidescope of parties, we glimpse the whirlwind nature of wedding crashing. John and Jeremy aren't just out on the make, though the girls are their ultimate goal. They are sympathetic characters. Being the life of the party attracts the women, but these guys really do love the food, the bands, entertaining the kids and dressing up in their suits. Not only are they Wedding Crashers, they are Wedding experts.<br/><br/>The ultimate crashing challenge comes when the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken) and he wife (Jane Seymor) is getting married in what is sure to be the social event of the year.<br/><br/>Of course, our friends find that this might just be a wedding too far, especially when they are invited to an extended weekend celebration at the Secretarys' home.<br/><br/>The fun really begins and I shall stop telling you what is going on as the ins and outs of this film are delightful. Jane Seymor has a marvellous scene with Owen Wilson and there are many moments you want to berry your head in the shoulder of the person next to you to stop laughing too loudly.<br/><br/>This is my favourite comedy of the year so far."
"bob the moo","Null","47","73","11 December 2005"," Good comedy that only struggles when it has to focus on the actual narrative
","John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey are committed bachelors who enjoy their womanising ways. They specialise in crashing weddings and picking up women for one night stands by taking advantage of their lower defences. Countless scores of women later, John is getting tired but the offer of ""one last big job"" tempts him back to crash the wedding of Treasury Secretary Cleary's daughter. Things go well until John falls for Claire Cleary while Jeremy finds himself trapped with the frighteningly clingy Gloria as the pair accept an invitation back to the weekend retreat of the Cleary family.<br/><br/>This did not appear strong enough to draw me into the cinema on its release but, on an trans-Atlantic flight it looked like being good enough to fill some time  which is actually a pretty fair summary of the film's strengths and weaknesses. I say this because it is funny enough to cover the problems that it has and thus will serve up as an enjoyable experience if you're relaxed enough to let this happen. The strengths lie in the lead two characters  they banter, they are lively and they are funny. Funny enough to cover up the fact that they are exploitative and sexual predators and funny enough to mean that the scenes where they are doing their thing are generally enjoyable. Of course it helps that Wilson and Vaughn are both doing their thing as usually and have great chemistry together  good news if you usually like them but, if you don't, then why bother? The weaknesses come in with the actual story because, every time someone has to fall in love with someone else, the laughs stop, the pace slows and the whole thing takes on a mushy air that doesn't gel that well with the banter scenes. Likewise the plot devices in the second hour tend to feel a little forced where they are just used to provide direction and create a proper ending etc. This doesn't mean it is terrible but it cannot be a good thing when you actively wish the plot would take a backseat in a film. The support cast share the comedy reasonably well; McAdams is cool and appealing, Fisher is a bit OTT but is funny, Seymour plays on her sexy image really well while Walken is reliable as ever as Christopher Walken.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable if patchy comedy. It trades on the usual delivery and chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn and the two do well to produce the film's best scenes when they are together. The need for a plot, romance and separation does hurt the film a little (because it is not as good as the aimless banter) but not a massive amount. Not a great comedy then but certainly good enough to please anyone who liked Anchorman, Dodgeball and other films of similar styles of humour."
"muri73","8","114","194","5 July 2005"," Crashers rock!
","Movie lives through Vaughn and Wilson. Both show an easy performance and want the audience to just simply have a good time.<br/><br/>The Story is nothing spectacular. If you liked ""Meet the Fockers"", you're gonna like this one as well.<br/><br/>Its the actors, who make the difference. Vaughn is hilarious and proofs, that he's much better in comedies than in ""serious"" movies. Wilson plays himself (as in every one of his movies) and scores a good 2nd place.<br/><br/>Walken is just Walken and thats worth half the ticket. The girls are gorgeous. Especially Rachel McAdams knocked me out. Holy Cow! The Crashers are good fun. Not an new invention of the genre, but especially because of the actors, this movie rocks!"

","John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are life-long friends who have made a hobby out of lying to get into wedding receptions, where they pick up vulnerable women with even more lies. Their plans to crash the upscale wedding of a high-profile politician (Christopher Walken) go awry when John falls in love with the politician's daughter (Rachel McAdams) and the two guys end up spending the weekend with her familywho just happen to be completely nuts! <br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is easily the funniest film of 2005. It's constantly hilarious and it's not completely immature. The premise is pretty creative and original. The film is not just filled with cheap jokes and toilet humor. There's actually a pretty mature love story to be found here as well. In all honestly, the script isn't that great but the film works really well because of the cast. The actors bring life into their characters and most of them give funny performances. Vince Vaughn is the true star of Wedding Crashers. His over the top performance is very funny. Some people may find him annoying though. Owen Wilson also gives a funny performance. He just wasn't as good as Vince but he holds his own. Together, Vaughn and Wilson have great chemistry and really make their scenes with one another really funny.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is one of the best young actresses working today. She appeared in three movies in 2005 and this one was the best. Her performance is pretty good and it's so easy to love this girl. Christopher Walken does his usual routine and he gives an okay performance. He isn't as funny as everyone else though. Isla Fisher is also another talented young actress. She comes out of no where and gives a very funny performance. Jane Seymour is underused which is too bad because she's pretty funny. Bradley Cooper was okay, nothing really special though. Not all of the film is perfect. I think the running time is too long. Long comedies rarely work out and while this one does, it could have still been edited. Also, the ending is kind of cheesy which is okay but a little unexpected. Will Ferrell makes a cameo and let's just say that it was not needed. It wasn't completely bad but he seemed to be trying way too hard. I really think that he's just an average comedian and nothing really special. One last thing, the film is pretty funny yet it doesn't have that great of a repeat value, at least for me. In the end, Wedding Crashers is worth checking out. Rating 8/10"

","Wedding Crashers is the latest installment in the new, over-the-top comedies cut from the same cloth as Old School or Meet The Parents. It will take it's rightful place in history along side these great comedies as it deserves.<br/><br/>Business partners John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are also best friends that go way back. Every year they get together and go on a binge of crashing weddings to take advantage of the romance in the air and ultimately, to score with the jealous bridesmaids, or any other single woman for that matter. John and Jeremy are very smooth and do a lot of research to get a back-story that explains who they are, how they are connected to the families and why they are there. They also have what seems to be at least a hundred rules to ensure the crashing of the wedding goes as planned and of course, this could not be possible without the original wedding crasher, Chaz (Will Ferrell), who is not only THE wedding crasher, but also an innovator, as you will see.<br/><br/>This all works very well for them until they decide to crash the wedding of weddings, Secretary Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter and her new husband-to-be. John was unable to achieve his goal at the Cleary wedding of establishing a relationship with his other daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who he is also falling in love with. Jeremy, too, is having his problems after achieving his goal with the Secretary's other daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher), perhaps a bit too quickly, as he finds out it was her first time and she quickly attaches herself.<br/><br/>The long story made short, both John and Jeremy end up on an extended weekend with the Cleary family and hilarity ensues, very much the same way Ben Stiller was put in uncomfortable positions by his fiancé's family in Meet The Parents.<br/><br/>This was a great comedy in which I have heard compared to There's Something About Mary. I would not place it on such an iconic platform but it was very good and holds it's own along with other great comedies of today. Vaughn and Owen are a great team. Will Ferrell is typical Will Ferrell in his small bit part as Chaz. Christopher Walken's part was too small to really be noticed. Isla Fisher played the psycho first-timer in such a way that it even scared me.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of this movie for me was Rachel McAdams. I took notice of her in Mean Girls and I believed she would be typecast in such roles for probably her whole career but she proved she could carry a movie as the lead love interest and was very captivating with her gorgeous smile.<br/><br/>If you liked the movies mentioned in this review, then I highly recommend seeing this one as well. It will not disappoint. 8.5/10"

"tburke85","8","6","7","20 June 2009"," Wedding Crashers A Hilarious Comedy
","Wedding Crashers was a hilarious comedy mainly because of the great performances by Owen Wilson and especially Vince Vaughn. Director David Dobkin is admirable in making this movie about two best friends who enjoy to spend their time crash weddings and picking up chicks. Owen Wilson and Vincent Vaughn both made this movie worth seeing because of their great comic chemistry with each other. Their scenes together are worth seeing it alone. The film also stars a more restrained Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, and Bradley Cooper who are equally impressive as the supporting characters. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. A few of the supporting actors provide some comic relief to to movie but most of the laughs come from Wilson and Vaughn as their characters find themselves in one hilarious situation after another. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the film made up for it's few flaws. I was very impressed with Wedding Crashers because it's one of the best comedies I've seen in quite sometime. My parents even liked it which really surprised me. Overall Wedding Crashers has plenty of humor and exceptional performances by the cast (Wilson and especially Vaughn) making this comedy worth seeing because is sure to please almost any fan of the genre."

","When I first watched this movie in the cinema when it was released I loved it then and saw it twice. I unfortunately forgot about it until I saw it again on TV tonight. How could I have forgotten? It is truly one of the best big box office movies that is actually funny. Clever humour, good morals (eventually), and plenty cheesy one liners that makes it a one of a kind amongst the many hundreds of slapstick US movies. I love how the movie demonstrates to us that the crazy gene does not discriminate between class and bank accounts, and we should all except our families with a sense of humour. I think any woman wouldn't mind if either of them crashed their wedding."

","The opening sequence with Dwight Yokum and Rebecca De Mornay is one of the funniest in the film. The rest doesn't live quite up to it. The movie suffers from an improbability problem. I know from working weddings like some they went to, it's not easy to sneak into a wedding, especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite! Besides that, I will say I enjoyed the film. It's not as funny as say, 40 Year Old Virgin, but there's some good stuff in there. Keir O'Donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the goth/artist/gay son of Walken. These were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson is very likable in the film as the partier-coming-to-grips with his age and wanting more out of life. He more or less plays the straight man to Vince Vaughn's antics.<br/><br/>Vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie. Funny, and good, but at times I was left scratching my head. He's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie.<br/><br/>The directing by Dobkin sometimes feels less than good. Desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these ""buddies"" looking a bit too disconnected.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you enjoy comedies, especially of this genre, see it. It is very formulatic and if you're smart, you'll know how it ends about 30 minutes into this overly long comedy. (over 2 hours) PS: Will Ferrell turns in a very odd performance as Chazz Reinhold the ultimate wedding crasher. You might feel a little dirty after watching this near out of place character."

","I'm not a guy who usually goes for the gay and sexual humor. This is not because I am a prude, but because these kinds of movies tend to take it too far and just isn't funny after that point. Wedding Crashers, however, executed this brand of humor perfectly. Another plus that makes this movie an above average comedy is the fact that the comedy did not take away from the plot. Many movies, such as Animal House, go so out of their way to be funny that they forget that movies are meant to tell a story. Wedding Crashers did a great job of keeping the comedy in the realm of a specific plot. Wedding Crashers is a unique and fun movie and I would definitely recommend watching it."

","This is the film that truly made Vince Vaughn a star. I had always been a fan of Owen Wilson (and was always slightly delighted that whatever film he turned up in - no matter how weak its material - he was always able to JUST pull it off in a really likable way); But with Vaughn, it always felt that he was a huge star in the making - and you really wanted him to do it - but it just never seemed to happen. Until Now.<br/><br/>The Wedding Crashers is that perfect mix of adult humour, classy settings and outright, laugh-out-loud, slightly pee-your-pants slapstick. I haven't laughed this hard since my girlfriend's battle-axe Mother decided to emigrate! The all-star line-up are perfectly cast - with a downright brilliantly ridiculous cameo from Will (how DOES he get away with it?) Ferrell. Everyone is fantastic in their own right - from the brilliantly realistic animosity between Rebecca De Morny and Dwight Yoakam (with some GREAT lines) before the opening credits even roll - to the closing scenes which - although appearing to contain enough cheese to satisfy even the biggest deep-pan aficionado - really, simply, works.<br/><br/>A platinum cast including the awesome Chritopher Walken, Keir o' Donnell, the always beautiful Jane Seymour (nicely bitter) and a host of others - but a special mention however MUST go to Isla Fisher. Apart from Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction - there has never been a more sexy, but impossibly scary Bunny Boiler as that portrayed by Ms Fisher (or is it Mrs Baron Cohen?) in this film. The irony here is that opposites really can attract - and sometimes you find exactly what you were looking for in a person - without realising it's precisely what you wanted. All in all - a really sweet film - without the sugar. Absolutely priceless!"

","Plumbing new depths in vulgarity and tastelessness, ""Wedding Crashers"" is a tiresome compilation of recent American guy-girl movie clichés. The acting is poor and the script worse, making the cinema seat harder as each long minute goes by. Of course the audience lapped it all up, guffawing at each sophomoric gag. How depressing to see that this awful movie is #1 at the box office. Good cinematography doesn't rescue it. We squirm seeing Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour repeatedly embarrassing themselves. We yawn at Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson lurching from unbelievable ""I love ya Buddy"" male bonding to predatory joint hunting of generic society chicks. Compared with the finer acting and script of now-running ""Must Love Dogs"", the winner of the toilet humor, bad language, degrade women and insult gays genre is undoubtedly ""Wedding Crashers"". Insatiable public appetite for this rubbish will ensure that we soon might see even worse movies, if that is possible."

","Some Spoilers -if this tripe can be spoiled.<br/><br/>This attempt at a male fantasy comedy fails on every count. Most to blame is the implausible screenplay but the hammed up bad acting and impossible premise don't help. Several scenarios simply do not work and the maudlin ""falling in love"" pretence that is supposed to make these guys likable drags the film kicking and screaming into one of the lamest conclusions in movie history.<br/><br/>The two male leads are about as believable and charming as the skanks they may actually pick up along the way. Fortunately, the two female leads turn out to be equally reprehensible in their poor judgement and immorality although I suspect the writer and director failed to notice this. One would marry for kinky sex, the other to run away from a violent fiancée. What was she doing with that guy anyway? These guys will eventually get what they deserve but I could help feeling the violent fiancé was a much better choice.<br/><br/>If you are naive enough to accept any unlikely plot device thrown your way, hate women, fear gay men, and believe Washington D.C. should have no minorities, then this is the comedy fantasy for you! The film has an odd sense of 50's values that reveals it's point of view to be sexist, homophobic, ageist and immoral (and not in a good way). Add an obnoxious Will Farrell ad lib and you have one of the year's worst films.<br/><br/>If you must, rent it, don't buy. You will feel bad having it around the house.<br/><br/>If you like a sexy comedy fantasy with turn of the century attitudes, see THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and stop encouraging hacks who make really bad movies like this one.<br/><br/>WEDDING CRASHERS is a hateful sad little pimple of a movie that made too much money in the summer of 2005 due to a sudden talent vacuum."

","I lasted just over an hour into this movie before my girlfriend and I rolled our eyes for about the 50th time and decided it was time to leave. The point we left was when the one kid rolled into bed with Vince Vaughn which was, to me, the last straw in a long line of cheesy, over the top corny scenes that were put into this movie to get the most dimwitted audience members to laugh uncontrollably.<br/><br/>I found it funny in the theater we watched it in because one half of the theater didn't laugh once throughout the entire time that we were there, yet the people on the right were howling from start to finish. Was the ventilation pumping something into the air on that side of the theater? Looking back, it seemed as though this movie was written for its shock value alone. I think the writers of this crap-fest basically thought to themselves, while writing, ""hmm, what is the most outlandish thing we could have happen here"" and then wammo, enter low brow slapstick humour to the extreme.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes or so, I felt as though I was watching an extended trailer for the movie. It was like watching a train wreck, I just couldn't look away (until we finally up and left). Thank God we had coupons, because I don't think I would have been able to look myself in the mirror ever again having known I had spent money on watching this movie.<br/><br/>Like star wars episodes 1,2 and 3, this is a movie is at its best in the preview.

","I will not bother with a synopsis, but I just saw a sneak preview of this movie tonight and had to write how much I loved it.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of both Vince Vaughn and Rachel McAdams might make me more partial to have chosen to see it originally, but it was both sweet and laugh out loud hilarious. In the vein of Old School, Anchorman & Starsky & Hutch, only with romance and quirky families thrown in to the mix. I think the audience for Wedding Crashers has the potential to be broader for that very reason. Vaughn and Wilson have a chemistry as lifelong friends, as do Wilson and McAdams as love interests. Supporting character roles were well cast and provided great framework.<br/><br/>See it on the 15th!"
"some_empty_friend","2","41","86","20 July 2005"," A Horribly Unoriginal ROMANTIC COMEDY
","I don't understand it. As a comedy lover, I was excited to see this movie get good reviews before it came out. ""Finally,"" I thought to myself, "" a movie that may actually pump a breath of fresh air in the stale lungs of what recently has been deemed 'comedy' in Hollywood.""<br/><br/>I walked into the film with a bias FOR the movie after hearing so many good things about it. My high hopes were shot down in the first half hour of the film. I wanted to enjoy it. I was hoping to enjoy it. But half hour in, and I had only cracked a smile once at some minor joke.<br/><br/>But the audience wasn't laughing it up and I couldn't understand why. There hadn't been anything funny yet. <br/><br/>After unfortunately watching it against my will last night for a second viewing, I payed more attention to the five people around me and their reactions to what was going on in the film. Just as the theater audience did, they laughed at only the most obvious things:<br/><br/>1.A character swearing (usually Vince Vaughn) <br/><br/>2.The gay kid (who did crack a smile on my face when they cut to him, but this has to be one of the worst representations of gays I've ever seen in a major film) <br/><br/>3.Obvious physical gags - Vaughn getting shot in the butt, getting touched under the table (which was blatantly STOLEN from American Pie 3, and how many times has someone been shot in the butt in a comedy?). <br/><br/>4.Dated sex jokes<br/><br/>There was no unique or original humor, nothing that hadn't been done before. And the humor in this movie consisted of the most cliché' rehashed jokes. There is no chemistry between Vaughn and Wilson. Vaughn is the supposed 'scene stealer,' while Wilson is the more serious one, who didn't make the audience laugh a whole lot. This has to be the worst comic ""duo"" I've seen in a comedy. <br/><br/>And to add further, Wedding Crashers, like most other Hollywood films, turns into a typical ""guy falls for girl who has macho boyfriend who treats her like crap and ends up falling for other guy"" plot. However, this films has probably the most trite use of the macho boyfriend- he cheats on the girl, he beats up Wilson, and he seems like a nice guy until all of a sudden he's suddenly a completely different character. <br/><br/>Owen Wilson's monologue at the end is the worst in film and theater history. He should be ashamed of himself for degrading his status as an actor to a speech that sums up every romantic comedy ever made. And this is a romantic comedy. It fits with the same category of Adam Sandler's guy-gets-the girl garbage, as well as Julia Roberts' never-ending line of crap. I give this a 2, only for the four times I cracked a smile, which I will count as one solid laugh, and Will Ferrell's line, ""What the f%#@ do you want?"" because of the hilarious tone of voice he uses.<br/><br/>IMDb made me check a box indicating ""This review may contain spoilers."" However, I have not given away any spoilers. You've seen this plot before. You've heard the jokes. You've seen the guy get the girl at the end where he kisses her. And right before Owen Wilson kisses her, he utters ""Would it be totally cliché' if I kissed you right now?"" Yes it would, Owen. Ironically, that line is a perfect metaphor for this excuse of a comedy film."
"karenlynn1","1","25","51","2 April 2006"," so predictable.
","I am truly disappointed with this movie. I expected a good comedy, which would leave me laughing out loud holding my gut. Instead I yawned. I looked at the clock. I counted the minutes of my life wasted while watching this crap... and as much as i was tempted to put on a better DVD...I (mistakenly) kept watching thinking that at some point it would get better.<br/><br/>It's not that funny. The plot is predictable. The script is terrible. <br/><br/>The scenes in the beginning move so fast, that you can barely tell what's going on...then half-way through you find out that it's NOT an American Pie type comedy but a romantic comedy. A romantic comedy with a plot that's already been done about a dozen times. Will he get the girl before she makes the biggest mistake of her life and marries somebody else? Then it gets dramatic and depressing. Then it gets silly (as Will Ferrel finally shows up) then the plot reaches it's predictable climax, and the movie ends. The best part of the movie, IMO was the end...no, not the final scene but the closing credits."

He was still much the same guy he is in his other movies, but this time he was also depressed and whinny for part of the movie. Also, there is no way to write a spoiler for this movie.

"FilmSnobby","1","29","61","20 July 2005"," ""We're not so young anymore . . . ""
",". . . Thus muses Owen Wilson to his pal Vince Vaughn in their new movie, *Wedding Crashers*. To which I say: Oh yeah? -- then act like it! But to expect maturity from the likes of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn would be pointless, considering that both of them have not exactly behaved like adults in any of their previous films. (Well O.K., Wilson was interesting in Wes Anderson's *Bottle Rocket*, and Vaughn had a pretty good part as a creepy step-dad in that Travolta vehicle from several years ago, but 1 out of, like, 20 for each actor is a lousy scorecard.)<br/><br/>Let it be said at once that Generation X is aptly named. If Wilson and Vaughn are the best comedy-team my generation can come up with, then we rightly deserve to be nameless. These guys make one long for Martin and Lewis (this is not meant to be complimentary). I spent a good portion of the movie wondering about the state of Wilson's hair: what's up with that, anyway? Why does he persist in looking like a late-Seventies stoner in movie after movie after movie? Is it supposed to be his ""trademark"", or something? As for his pal Vaughn, he seems to be literally EATING in every scene of this film, and boy, it shows: this is one individual who is, to a painfully obvious degree, bloated with the corrupting amenities of easy living (i.e., the typical life of an undisciplined Hollywood star). He has become a fat oaf who turns in lazy, blubbery performances. Why is this guy a star, again? Was it that whole ""you're money"" thing?<br/><br/>Screw these guys and their lousy films. I mean, really. (I was dragged to see *Wedding Crashers*; I certainly didn't seek it out.) What kills me is that I kept reading all these laudatory reviews -- from professional movie critics who are doubtless GenXers themselves -- about this movie's ""sharp, edgy wit"" before I actually saw the damned thing. This is merely a case of the tribe protecting its own. Hey look, if your idea of sharp, edgy wit includes the spectacle of Vince Vaughn getting yerked off under a dinner table, then you'll love *Wedding Crashers*. And you'll die laughing when Jane Seymour gets her vanilla-pudding-bags squeezed by Owen Wilson. If those bits don't it for you, perhaps the repugnant wisecracks about Eleanor Roosevelt's sexuality (!) will tickle your ribs. Wow, what a scream.<br/><br/>And why wasn't I surprised to see A Certain Former SNL Alumnus make a boorish, unfunny cameo at the end of the movie? (Hint: he's the one who screams a lot, which, I am told, is supposed to be hilarious.) Look, people: it's time to declare a moratorium on the Wilson/Vaughn/Stiller/Ferrell/Rudd Nexus of Bad Comedy. Who's with me? The current going-rate of 3 comedies per year featuring any or all of the above-mentioned performers is literally destroying American civilization. It must be stopped.<br/><br/>1 star out of 10."

","I don't know a better way to convey to the reader how I feel about this movie than to say this. If someday, when I'm on my death bed, with only a few hours left to live conversing intimately with my Pastor, and he asks me if there is anything that he can do for me before I die. I'd tell him: Ask God, if I can please have two extra hours added to my life to make up for the two hours I wasted watching WEDDING CRASHERS.<br/><br/>Katie Couric on her morning show, with the cast to this movie present, said ""WEDDING CRASHERS is the funniest movie I've seen in my lifetime."" So towards the end of watching this movie I started thinking about what she said and came to this conclusion: A. Katie never saw the movie and was too embarrassed to say so B. Katie saw the movie, knew it sucked wet dog fur, but she was too embarrassed to tell the cast C. Katie saw the movie, knew it sucked wet dog fur but she was paid a huge sum of money to say she liked it D. Katie saw the movie, and really did like it, and this explains why she's still having trouble finding a good man in her life This movie's Mission Statement was obviously-""Concentrate on making money first even though we know the movie we're making stinks."" The multiple producers, (I counted seven and all males) used the time honored equation for bad movie making that should have tipped me off before I bought my ticket. Take some trendy actors and actresses, stick them into a single gag theme script, that has the word ""wedding"" in the title, hype the idea up to gullible ""get rich quick"" investors who are looking to cash in on what they think is another BIG FAT Greek WEDDING movie project, then laugh your way to the bank.<br/><br/>Problem is, folks, no one is laughing. In fact, in the half-full audience I was at, I heard more snoring than laughter. I'm sorry now that I didn't sneak out at the beginning with my date to see BAD NEWS BEARS, which is a more fitting title for this movie. (Actually, the title DUMB AND DUMBEST ANOTHER SEQUEL fits this rag like a glove.) <br/><br/>You all know the plot line by now, John Beckwith, (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey, (Vince Vaughn) a pathetic pair of committed womanizers who sneak into weddings to take advantage of the food, drink and romantic tinge in the air, find themselves at odds with one another when John meets and falls for Claire Clearly, (Rachel McAdams.) <br/><br/>This is a very angry movie that is irrespecter of persons. It's quick to mock everyone, including our mentality challenged, in the worst way with undertones that probably reflect the dysfunctional home life of the scriptwriters, (both males I might add.) In fact, I don't recall seeing a movie that degrades women more than this one does, (think about that last statement.) There's a homophobic subtext throughout. I could say it's anti-military too, by the quick reference to using a bogus Purple Heart as a ploy to win an unsuspecting ""woman's heart"" but that would be stretching it.<br/><br/>Infidelity and the unbridled use of the ""F"" word attached to various nouns and adjectives is as pervasive as in the movie GOODFELLAS. The mother, (Jane Seymore) cheats on the husband and father of the bride, (Christopher Walken), the groom cheats on the bride, the bridesmaid lies about being a virgin to land her beau, the two implausible Lotharios lie constantly and the movie ends with our two couples driving into the sunset laughing about their next make believe ruse. Everybody in this movie is screwed up except the butler.<br/><br/>The director, (also male) uses every tasteless trick to get laughs that never come with the pathetic duo singing ""Shout"" to the point that I thought I was watching outtakes of ANIMAL HOUSE.<br/><br/>In my opinion, anyone who feels good at the end of this movie needs counseling, unless of course, they're feeling good because the movie was finally over.<br/><br/>Ladies, if the man in your life tells you WEDDING CRASHERS is his favorite movie, I'd avoid him like you'd avoid a bad smell, (unless of course your name is Kitty Couric.) My advice to the producers of this film is to remake the film with Christpher Walken in the lead using his very funny SNL role as The Continental who crashes weddings and funerals looking for rich widows, or as a sequel to DIRTY ROTTON SCOUNDRELS.<br/><br/>My advice to the cast. Rachel, now that you've done something fun, go back to a part that endures as in THE NOTEBOOK. Vince, I think you've been typecast since SWINGERS. Some of your rapid funny lines were funny, like talking dirty to your girlfriend on the phone, but it's starting to get old. Find a dramatic role next time.<br/><br/>If this movie manages to make any money, heaven help us, as that means there will be more of these morose cinematic insults to the public's intelligence, (save Katie Couric's) to follow."

I just sat there and kept looking at my watch wondering when this crappy movie was going to be over with. Movies like this cause the box office slumps.

","Why do so many people love this movie? I just didn't buy it. The characters were undeveloped and the story predictable. I chuckled maybe once or twice during the entire movie, but in actuality, I was bored. To begin with, I found Will Ferrell's character disgusting and disturbing. To play on the idea of picking up women at funerals is in incredibly poor taste--even for comedy. Not to mention the relationship with Vince Vaughn's character and the psychotic girl was simply unrealistic. Owen Wilson's character finds love, so, in turn, Vince Vaughn's character, a man who thrives on being a playboy, who spent the latter part of the film hiding from the crazy girl, suddenly finds himself in love with her? Let alone the campy ending, which really seemed like the writers didn't know what to do, so they threw everyone together for a happy dysfunctional ending. This movie was supposed to be a situation comedy and I just didn't buy the situation, nor did I find the comedy really all that funny. It would make sense to be that senseless if the movie was intended to be ""stupid"" humor, but this movie was not promoted in that way. And as a result the ""jokes"" were poor attempts at raunchy humor and not really all that original."

The only people who earned their punishment in this movie were the leads and the rival for Claire's affection (After all, he was working to care for the environment and house the homeless. How evil can you be!). Jeremy's hell night might have been amusing if his torturers hadn't been so pathetic.<br/><br/>You're better off staying home with some classic comedies.

All of the humor styles I hinted at are executed with the pure persoona, with pure energy. Both of the leads are fun to watch. Their system for crashing weddings, while a bit of a stretch, is so committed, you can't help but go along with it. The Bradley Copper character is so unlikeable and irritating every time he is on screen, yet he is played to such a delightfully slimy t I have to give credit.<br/><br/>Everyone's putting forward effort here, to make us laugh, and while this is hardly a cackling till you tear up kind of affair I had fun with it.

I don't have to go far for examples, the homo-artist-molester (not a deep enough character to avoid seeing him as an archetype, as if writers had never met an artist or a homosexual, and therefore are afraid of them, attributing to this one character an also violent and creepy element), the girl Vince Vaughn's character ends up with does a good job playing crazy until randomly breaking character and admitting to not really being a virgin....it goes on and on.

Even the supposedly ""outrageous"" scenes were not that funny and really poorly done. Every plot turn was so predictable. I mean I feel like I've seen this type of movie a million times. How many times have you seen a screwball comedy where the guy courts the girl under false pretenses only to get caught being somebody that he's not. So then of course the girl gets really mad and completely blows him off. But he falls so deeply in love with the girl that he realizes he just needs to be himself with her and she'll fall in love with him and everybody will live happily ever after. Mind you this part of the plot takes up more than an hour of the film. The best thing about this movie is Rachel McAdams. She's actually a very good actress and she's absolutely gorgeous. But even she couldn't stop me from cringing during some of her ""falling in love"" scenes with Owen Wilson. Vince Vaughn's performance is good but the material is so bland that the fact that he can still make you chuckle is a testament to his talent as a comedic actor. The first 15-20 minutes of this movie, the actual wedding crashing is the best part. You may recall the wedding and reception scenes at the beginning of ""Old School"". Vince Vaughn steals those scenes and is hilarious. So I guess someone decided to make an entire movie with Vince Vaughn doing his Vince Vaughn thing at weddings. That's how ""Wedding Crashers"" got a green light. This film gets bad when it becomes a very predictable love story with Owen Wilson playing the sad sack. All right..

It has all the earmarks of a pitch grown to hasty green light and a wild time had by the cast at the world's expense. <br/><br/>Look at Walken for instance, I felt sorry for him, he should have known better, unless he just needs the money. <br/><br/>It is symptomatic however of how low standards have fallen for comedy. And how easy it is to make people laugh. Having walked out on Meet The Fokkers after the first fifteen minutes, I can say that this is not quite as inane, but is equally unfunny. <br/><br/>Thank goodness there is a minimum of ten lines here. I honestly can't think of anything good to say about this movie. What a bad summer for films so far, and this is keeping up that high standard. How about a zero out of ten. But alas, I have to give it a one, nothing lower."

","I suppose it's a sign of age, but 15mins into this I started thinking how much better it would have been with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in the Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson roles. That would have been a funny film. Or, in modern day terms, maybe the guys from Friends, Chandler and Joey, or Ross as the more neurotic one. Ironically, Wedding Crashers would then simply have been branded as 'not as funny as Friends'. And it isn't.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Wilson are simply too old for this skit. It's creepy. They're past 35 easy, and not a young 35. Vaughn is quite heavy, which ages him, Wilson has crows' feet around his eyes. In a bad light they could pass for 50. Yet they're seducing young, vulnerable gals at weddings. This sleazy behaviour is only forgivable if a) They're a lot younger, and it's irrepressible folly of youth set to encounter a learning curve. b) They're really good looking, so the gals implicitly get more out of it - it works as a fantasy thing for them. c) They're marked out as bad guys from the start, and you know they're riding for a fall, and kind of look forward to it gleefully.<br/><br/>Instead, they're like weird guys in an office you catch doing something wrong, and you think, hmmm, I don't want to hang around these two.<br/><br/>Mild spoilers. It seems wrong to warn of spoilers when the writers seem so keen on spoiling the film themselves. Naturally there's no logic in the comedy, others have pointed this out. Jane Seymour is a nympho, but then suddenly isn't and that isn't referenced again. The senator's daughter is a shy, mad virgin, but then she turns out to be a nympho too. Vince Vaughn thinks she's mad, but then unaccountably thinks he has 'feelings' for her. The gratuitous sex works well, especially near the beginning, but it sits oddly with the tone of the film, it brings home how these creeps just use and abuse girls, and we're meant to approve. A Curtis Lemmon film would have suggested it, and it wouldn't be raunchy, and you'd get the idea, but you could skirt around their reprehensible behaviour.<br/><br/>Ultimately the two leads just don't have the charm and the film really gets worse as it goes on. The final scenes involving funeral crashing are in horrible taste, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>The whole film is like sitting through an awful best man's speech where he thinks he's being funny but it's just tacky and cringey."

","There is so much wrong with this movie, I could be here a week typing this. But one of the most glaring missteps (for lack of a stronger word) is the homophobic element surrounding the character of Todd. Portrayed as ""crazy,"" ""weird"" and ""scary"" the film takes the gay stereotype of over 30 years ago and resurrects it. It also makes sure to add, to comedic effect, the ""horror"" of a gay man trying to seduce a straight man. Then, add in a dash of the ""looney grandmother"" who spouts homophobic slurs for laughs. What this film does to fuel ignorance and intolerance towards gays and lesbians is no laughing matter."

","The premise ordinarily would have driven me from this movie: that of two guys attending weddings with the sole purpose of picking up girls. But seeing the fairly good rating on IMDb, I thought I've give it a try.<br/><br/>Big mistake! The humor was real schoolboy stuff, and I guess they would rate this movie highly for the lingerie and topless shots in the opening 20 minutes or so. Adults will not be so easily pleased. There was very little in the way of witty dialog and and Vaughn's lines were often delivered with such rapidity, most of what he said was incomprehensible. Then Wilson's inordinately nasal delivery served only as a grating counterpoint.<br/><br/>The plot was transparent, but this is not always a handicap. The lack of sub-plots was, though. So too, the unidimensional characterizations for most of the cast, and when combined with lazy - or at best inept - writing, the entire movie became a trial.<br/><br/>Chris Walken was badly underused as he has a true flair for comedic timing and delivery. His scenes were usually the highlight, but near the end his final lines were entirely out of accord with him as a political-minded man.<br/><br/>The real message of the movie delivered by Wilson was as clumsy a piece of writing as you're ever likely to see on film. It hearkens back to the soppy moralizing that used to punctuate many US sitcoms in the 60's and 70's. Of course by this time I was squirming and repeatedly checking my watch for the end of this sorry flick.<br/><br/>Too few paths were trodden as it appears the movie was intended solely as a vehicle for both Wilson and Vaughn. The character ""Sack"" didn't get his comeuppance and Randolph (the butler) had far more potential to add to each scene he was in and have a greater presence. Will Ferrel was merely grotesque and deserved to be uncredited.<br/><br/>In all, I'm glad I didn't waste a movie ticket to see this, but sorry I blew $10 on the DVD.<br/><br/>Good comedy is hard to find, and I doubt it will ever come with the names of Vaughn or Ferrell."

"eelpie_03","5","5","8","26 July 2005"," Cute, crude, and largely illogical . . .
","'Wedding Crashers' is not the sort of flick I take in very often - I am not a great a fan of crude, gross-out, low-brow humour.<br/><br/>This movie did have some very funny moments, especially when Vince Vaughn's Jeremy character goes off on a tangent.<br/><br/>The premise is interesting at best - confirmed bachelors & divorce arbitrators seeking female 'companionship' at weddings, only to avoid commitment in any form.<br/><br/>Of course the flick could not just be the crashing of weddings, so it evolves (sort of) into a romantic comedy where-in both our leads find true love.<br/><br/>The problem I had with the movie was the lack of logic displayed at various times: Distant relatives of the Secretary of the Treasury are invited to his house by the shore without their bona fides being confirmed. In reality they'd have been thoroughly vetted before getting within 20 meters of a cabinet secretary and presidential candidate.<br/><br/>The hot-to-trot mature mother comes on to one of the leads, presents herself in a state of semi-undress, and then . . . disappears from the plot.<br/><br/>This could have been an up-dated 'Mrs. Robinson' theme, and used as a bedroom farce, with people chasing other people around the house in the dead of night, but once she's had her kit off in John's presence, she fades into the back-ground.<br/><br/>The boyfriend, Sack, is a total, vicious psychopath, but nobody seems to notice it but our leads, and the audience. When Sack SHOOTS Jeremy, no police are called, no doctor is summoned to administer to Jeremy (nutty Gloria is chosen to extract the shot from Jeremy's behind!), and Jeremy is sitting normally within minutes. The entire hunting scene is merely gratuitous violence coupled with an incomplete thought process.<br/><br/>The gay son's character was totally wasted. Todd makes it plain he feels alienated from his otherwise politically correct family, and that could have been used to the advantage of one of the leads.<br/><br/>Just as John dances with flower girls at wedding receptions to gain favour with the admiring single women in attendance, he could have befriended Todd to display his sensitivity to Clare. Instead Todd is used as a gay cliché, climbing on top of the already trussed and helpless Jeremy.<br/><br/>John's drunken wedding-crashing rampage after the rejection by Clare is somewhat, if not totally, out of character. The boozing, brooding rejected boyfriend thing has been done to death.<br/><br/>Perhaps most perplexing is hypocritical reactions both leads display when informed their partner is in love or getting married. Jeremy rejects John's feelings at breakfast at the house by the shore; when Jeremy announces his engagement to Gloria, John insults Jeremy and tells him in no uncertain terms to leave.<br/><br/>If John had a shred of the intellect he'd displayed over and over again, he would have known the Jeremy - Gloria wedding activities would have given him the opportunity to get close to Clare.<br/><br/>Instead he looks up perennial loser and funeral crasher Chas . . .<br/><br/>Some of the stuff was funny, but much was just plain old ludicrous."

Rachel McAdams is so sweet and adorable that you feel like she's the girl next door that you've been in love with your entire life. Christopher Walken is an actor with such warmth and charisma that it's impossible not to love him. The real highlight of the film though is Isla Fisher. She is so natural and convincing in one of the most difficult roles of all time, that is scares the hell out of me. I'm scared to ever meet her because of how convincing she was. Will Ferrell delivered arguably the greatest cameo of all time. Even Bradley Cooper was brilliant as the chauvinistic, over the top jackass who is stealing the adorable, perfect girl. I really love everything about this film. I die in laughter from start to finish every time I see it. It's so quotable as well. My only real complaint is that it's pretty one-dimensional but that can be forgotten with how perfect of a comedy it is. Vince Vaughn is really a comic genius.

","Wedding Crashers, one of the top comedies of 2005, is a great comedy because it will appeal to so many different kinds of people. The teenagers are going to love it (it's too much for kids under 14), adults will have a blast, and everyone in between will have some good laughs to remember. Starring comedic powerhouses Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, Wedding Crashers is a sure bet if you're looking for a fun time.<br/><br/>John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) are divorce counselors whose hobby is crashing weddings. Yes, it's really ironic. The dynamic duo have every part of the crash planned from the get go. Slap on a new name, a reasonable backstory, and a big smile, and they're ready to go eat, drink, and mingle with the women at each ceremony. The only thing they aren't prepared for is one of them falling hard for a bridesmaid (Rachel McAdams) who is the daughter of the Secretary of State (Christopher Walken).<br/><br/>The acting is extremely good, and when you've got the comedic talents of Wilson, Vaughn, and Walken, it's hard not to be good. Although Wilson and Vaughn play the same characters we're used to over and over, they're at their best here. Wilson's typical slacker always has a sweet side, and here is no different. He and McAdams have nice chemistry, despite the fact that he's far from her in age. Vaughn's quick thinking and sarcastic Jeremy is probably one of the best comedic performances of recent memory, and in 2005, it's second to only Steve Carell in The 40 Year Old Virgin. His interactions with Walken's son and other daughter, played by Isla Fisher, are off the wall hilarious. Fisher plays a crazy character that can get annoying sometimes, but will make you wide-eyed at how insane she is. Fisher does a great job of making moments that sound cute and funny sound almost scary in a funny way. Rachel McAdams is at her best here, as her character is extremely likable, as she always is (except for Mean Girls, of course). McAdams has a subtle trait in her that makes her so special as an actress, the way she can catch the audience. It's a rare quality that few actresses possess.<br/><br/>The humor is everywhere from simply brainless to clever and witty. Some jokes are complex, while some are potty jokes. Vaughn does his thing with the angry and impatient jokes, as well as the sarcasm. Wilson's humor is mostly slapstick and simple, but he does it very well. Walken brings intensity and humor together and meshes them perfectly for a good performance. Wedding Crashers is a must see for fans of any of the actors, but I think everyone will come away from it laughing at least a few times, even if they don't like it. It's a memorable experience that you shouldn't take for granted. Take it from me, it's a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>9/10 --spy"

","Let me start off by saying that I really liked this movie. I thought it was well directed and had a great cast. The only problem really was the second half. The first half was hysterical and funny. The second half was not funny at all. Take Will Ferrel for example. They did nothing with him what so ever. They just expected him to be crashing funerals funny. Because it's Will Ferrel and because he crashes funerals they expected it to be funny, but it's not. Ever since the clichéd love story started is when it went down hill. I mean, we've seen it all before. It's the same love story as ""Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers, The NoteBook, 13 Going 30, Monster In Law, Titanic, The Wedding Singer, The Wedding Planner, When Harry Met Sally"" and much more. But apart from a terrible second half (and yes, Will Ferrel is part of the second half), the first half was great and hilarious.

It was about 2 guys who attend weddings for free food, and to meet girls. I felt like I knew the characters, and that means that the writers and directors and actors them self did a good job getting the personality of the characters out. I was however disappointed in the fact that the ending was very sudden and seemed ""untimely"" if you will and I think must will agree with that statement.

","One of the things movie audiences have to look forward to every summer is not only the release of several sub-par action movies, but also the inevitable arrival of the next ""frat pack comedy"". As this summer's past installment of the latter, everyone must have had a general impression of what to expect from Wedding Crashers - a simple storyline which is basically only an excuse to showcase the comedic leads, and give plenty of opportunity for improvised one-liners and other such laughs. <br/><br/>Wedding Crashers indeed lives up to the long loved frat pack formula, but still manages to take audiences by surprise in many aspects. It certainly pushes boundaries in terms of sexual content for humor, but fear not, the jokes are never in such bad taste that they fall into the realm of ""gross-out humor"" - the movie is far too funny for that. And surely enough, the key to the film's success lies in its two leads: Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn seem to be a comedic match that was always meant to be, with the effortless ease and skill they play off each other, managing to evoke a laugh from the most mundane of situations. Between Wilson's laid back, easy going persona and Vaughn's manic fast- talking improvisational skills, every second the two are on screen they never come across as less than superbly entertaining. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, director David Dobkin and other filmmakers are not content to make a movie revolving simply around the pair of them doing their thing - they find it necessary to convert the story into more of a clichéd romance near the end. Not only is this approach far overdone and not that enjoyable at all, but it completely clashes with the jovial mood of the first section. It was a good attempt at a more profound storyline, but ultimately the film would have been more entertaining had it taken itself a bit more lightly, and simply given Vaughn and Wilson more time to wreak havoc playing off each other. As such, it is still a highly entertaining film, but mainly worth watching for the first half or so. <br/><br/>Although the focus is clearly on the two lead characters here, they are backed up by an excellent supporting cast as well, especially the beautiful and very talented Rachel McAdams as the object of Wilson's affections, and Isla Fisher as Vaughn's psychotic and overly clingy girlfriend. Jane Seymour also raises many a laugh (often uncomfortable ones given) as the mother of the two of them, and Christopher Walken... well, what can be said about Christopher Walken really? Suffice to say he is beyond excellent as usual, raising tears of laughter from doing virtually nothing at all. <br/><br/>As much as I may have never expected to say this, Wedding Crashers would have been much more entertaining had it made an attempt to stick closer to the frat pack formula instead of trying to work a more serious romance element in, which clashed uncomfortably with the carefree, uplifting mood of its first half, which was much more enjoyable. Still, Wedding Crashers is nonetheless one of the very funniest movies released in a long while, and worth seeing if only for Vaughn and Wilson's unparalleled chemistry and amazing ability to play off each other. Expect to partake in many a laugh, however crude or filthy, when watching Wedding Crashers!<br/><br/>-8.5/10"

Together the two wreak havoc on the weddings of total strangers, as they sleep with a bevy of beautiful women. <br/><br/>When our two conniving heroes crash the town's biggest wedding, things start to go awry. Beckwith becomes immediately smitten with Claire Cleary (played with ease by Rachel McAdams). To make matters worse, Claire is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (a brilliant Christopher Walken). Meanwhile at the same wedding Grey meets Gloria Cleary (played by Aussie starlet Isla Fisher). While she seems nice enough, Grey quickly discovers she is not what he expected. The rest of the movie follows the two leads as they weasel their way into the Cleary family circle, all the while trying to win the hearts of their respective crushes. While the movie (and subsequently the laughs) fall away slightly near the end, there is no doubt this movie will become a cult classic over time. There's even an unnecessary, terrible cameo from Will Ferrell (hey, I love the guy but he is useless in this). Vaughan is clearly having a ball in this, while Wilson does a great job of playing the foil. Pop this DVD in the player and enjoy a riotous time."
"721mm","6","3","4","5 January 2006"," A fun comedy that works because of its cast
","Wedding Crashers is a fun comedy that works simply because the filmmakers know what to do with what they've got. The great humor of Wedding Crashers is not found in the cleverness of its script or the creativity of its story, but rather in its lead actors. Had anyone but Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn been the leads, this movie would have tanked. They are both famous for that congenial charisma that so many people find humorous  the type that makes them come off as the fun buddies that we all wish we could call up on a Friday night. Director David Dobkin must know this, because he gives Wilson and Vaughn plenty of scenes to show off the qualities that have made them two of America's funniest and most likable stars. <br/><br/>To fulfill the perfect cast, Rachel McAdams and Christopher Walken fill in the necessary roles. McAdams again reminds us why she has become so popular in the past year, glowing with her vibrant smile and charm that interact perfectly with every character on screen, especially Wilson's. Christopher Walken, among his many extraordinary traits, is famous for his dry, sarcastic sense of humor  revealed through his one of a kind voice. He gets a chance not only to earn some laughs in a way that only he can do, but also to play the role of the amiable father figure with the great advice. <br/><br/>Make no mistake, though  underneath this film's main selling point of a couple of funny guys going around and crashing weddings to sleep with girls (an idea that is just about concluded within the first 15 minutes)  is a sappy, conventional chick flick. I use that term carefully though, because Wedding Crashers never actually falls victim to the typical stereotypes of your average chick flick. It avoids them because of its great cast and the chemistry they all share on screen  which can appeal to just about anyone who enjoys a good laugh. It conceals the fact that the script is probably one of the worst excuses for a comedy within the past year. What's great is that we never have to look that far  because the characters all seem to be enjoying themselves too much, and they make the film just as enjoyable to watch."

","I cannot believe that anyone laughed at this disgusting movie. I for one wanted my money back after I had to sit through two hours of this trash. I shook my head after every scene. The movie got worse and worse. The ending was stupid. My favorite part was the end when I got to leave the theater and go home. What a piece of junk! My disgust for this movie knows no bounds. I will never see another Owen Wilson movie again. Ever. Who enjoys this type of filth? Certainly not me. I did not laugh even one time during the movie. It was a very disappointing two hours.

I happen to like silly movies like these, but in my opinion this one simply was not funny. I laughed maybe twice although there were hundreds of jokes throughout.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is two guys, can't tell how old they're supposed to be, but unless they are 25 or less already I feel sorry for them (guess that's part of the joke, how pathetic they are)who ""crash weddings"" to meet girls, which honestly is sort of an interesting idea for a story. It's definitely original, however this story is filled with bathroom humor that is so in your face and over the top.<br/><br/>After their cover was finally blown towards the end it seemed completely ludicrous that the ""secretary of treasury"" dad would allow a sheisty middle aged phoney who duped his entire family and bedded his seemingly teenage daughter MARRY this guy.<br/><br/>The bottom line as far as I'm concerned is that the story could have been really funny. The plot could have been really funny, but it just wasn't. It had potential, but didn't deliver.<br/><br/>Just one persons opinion."

","Owen Wilson, the man who has a nose resembling an intimate part of the male body, finally rids himself of a co-star that outshines him like Jackie Chan or his best buddy, Ben Stiller. It's rather unfortunate that the vehicle he's chosen is such a waste of a life.<br/><br/>The overall idea of having two guys, the other being the rather intimidating Vince Vaughn, lie through their teeth to get laid and doing it at weddings, to which they are not invited smell great at the beginning but soon turn into a fume-infested stink fest and that's just at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>The turning point is when we first meet Wilson's lady love. She is presented as such a cuddly, too good to be true, stand up babe, that when Wilson engages in a rather sappy first encounter talk with her, you know virtually everything that is going to happen next, including Wilson falling head over heels in love and that the two guys get to grow up mentally. One of the rather simple lessons in this movie is that Wilson and Vaughn are too old to crash weddings: (Quote (Wilson)): I'm still young."" (Some lady): ""You're not that young.""<br/><br/>The supporting cast is what saves the movie from being a total bomb but is Christopher Walken really that hung up for work that he wants to play a role mimicking Robert De Niro's in Meet the Parents. His Father of the Bride (another movie rip-off) is so hard-nosed at the beginning but soon falls into the same ""go with what makes daughter happy at the end.""<br/><br/>The obstacle, of course is a psycho boyfriend who we know will get shafted by Wilson and Vaughn right when we first meet him. The sister, who Vaughn is forced to couple up with was the one decent surprise. The actress who plays her seems like ten fingernails scratching a blackboard but she wins you over like something that is very nice to have around. The less said about Jane Seymour's rather embarrassing bedroom scene the better and that goes for the brother's as well.<br/><br/>So to sum up Wedding Crashers is a glass of fresh milk that gets tepid the more you leave it out of the fridge and leaves you with a sour smell and bitter taste, but nice try Wilson. Hope in the future you will return to supporting parts where you are best suited."

Similar to when I saw 'Meet the Fockers', I felt as if I should be wearing a dirty raincoat during and leaving the 'movie' and I use the word 'movie' loosely. I must, however, admit to being rather fascinated throughout by Owen Wilson's nose which was the only thing which held my interest. It is a sort of miniature version of a Karl Malden conk. Anyway, conks aside, how anyone can describe this pap as 'Comedy of the Year' is beyond me. A couple of slapstick bits during the baseball game made me smile but that was it. All in all pure tripe.

","Wow, I've seen some lame comedies in my time but this was one of the worst I've seen in awhile. First off the premise is pretty offensive particularly if you're a woman... drunken louts, scam weddings and bed women by lying and manipulating... but let's move beyond that. For two guys who specialize in 'crashing' weddings both Vaughn and Owen seem incapable of thinking on their feet even though they reference a list of 'rules' developed by some 'master' wedding crasher. There's no real chemistry between either actor which makes most of the jokes sound awkward rather than funny and it's pretty obvious that Vaughn was enjoying the wedding cakes on set a little too much. There is an extended scene where the two have dinner with the family of a woman that Owen has fallen in love with that is possibly one of the worst I have seen. Every ancient, clichéd dinner gimmick including the 'cute as a button' grandma who gets tipsy and says outrageous things is present. The periodic need for showing topless women also comes across as a sophomoric effort to titillate young men. <br/><br/>If this movie makes you laugh then you are indeed very fortunate as there is no comedy you won't find funny.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me a lot of Hudson Hawk, it enjoyed a little popularity at the time and then quickly became remembered as one of the worst movies of its decade."

","I give this movie a 2 because it starts out as fun and funny. Unfortunately, that is the best it deserves. Based on the previews, this film has the premise of being an outrageous comedy. When the film begins, it lays out further premise of being a sex comedy. I'm not opposed to that after growing up with films like Porkys and such. For the first half hour the film delivers pretty much just that with some fair laughs. However, shortly afterward the film begins to deteriorate and moves into a whole different realm of twisted cinematography with little to no humor at all. I can't even classify it as a black comedy. Not only that, but plausibility is completely lost by this point as well. The majority of the film is completely senseless and lacks any real creativity or talent. It plays to an extremely immature and demented mind. Further more, it is long and drawn out and the end couldn't come soon enough.<br/><br/>Allow me to say that it scares me to think that society has deteriorated so much that such a film could be considered as anything better than garbage."

It's too bad there was this ""funny-man wanna-be"" talking over him all the time. The only times I wanted to laugh out loud were squashed by the obnoxiously unfunny Vaughn.

","The characters in Wedding Crashers are as shallow as its script. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play two characters whose names aren't important enough to remember who (it seems no matter what) also get whatever woman they want at weddings. They're the life of the party, and they are very unlikable for the audience. As a female, I was disgusted with the objectification of women in the script. Once Owen or Vince catches the eye of the object of their desire for that night, she is caught, and she goes to bed with them. ""Oh gee, he just looked at me. I think I'll have sex with him."" ""Oh, look. He's playing with little kids. I think I'll go to bed with him."" Sheesh. Thank you Hollywood for only demonstrating to me even more how shallow and unrealistic the media really is.<br/><br/>As the PWP (plot...what plot?) continues, the crappiness of the movie also continues (who woulda thought?). The shallowness of the plot makes the characters unrealistic. There's no depth to any of them. And the funeral thing? ""I'm so sad and horny. I'm going to have meaningless sex with you!""

Weddings that have the atmosphere of one of those overblown Academy Award dance numbers; where every sexy woman is a no-nonsense slut; and rich families portrayed not only as dysfunctional, but that would require sixteen closets to hide the skeletons and black sheep.<br/><br/>As far as the cast, Vaughn, he's an okay actor. He has that puffy, charismatic every-guy quality that can work at times. Wilson on the other hand...a short, youthfully-faced dweeb who looks like he has a 30-year-old wig on his head. Walken (as usual) can just make you laugh with his now patented vocal approach, and Seymour now officially qualifies as a GILF who could steam up a teenager.<br/><br/>But this dead, wish-fullfillment screenplay gives no one anything unique to do in the slightest, and leaves you raging your fists at the skies as to why it made so much money. When you constantly see major league athletes listing this as their favorite movie of *ALL TIME*, you know the fabric of the universe is in a catastrophicly failing flux.<br/><br/>We've all been to weddings, right? Let me follow that up with this: when have you *ever* come close to experiencing anything like this? If you have, write a book, I'd love to read it. For me, been to about 15 weddings in my life, and allow me to summarize *my* experience: *EVERY*, every woman comes with a date. There are no hot, single, promiscuous bimbos hoping to get nailed; nobody takes to the dance floor in frenzied abandon to hoist people into the air; the food sucks; and everybody wants to leave the reception after about an hour.<br/><br/>Now, make *that* into a watchable film.

","What a hilarious idea!! Guys who crash weddings to get laid! The stories they have to make up to get the women! The Rules created by their mentor that they follow by the number! The montage in the beginning is So funny and SO energetic that the movie basically shoots its wad within the first 15 minutes. Then it becomes a mainstream love story with Owen Wilson as his usual casually corny self and an admittedly adorable Rachel McAdams (this girl is going places since her twin, Jennifer Garner is out of commission). Isla Fisher, the wacky sister is absolutely amazing. She was also in ""the Swimming Pool"" for you movie hounds. The writing is so mainstream and so pedestrian that I am left fantasizing about all the missed opportunities - which creative types could conjure simply from reading the 100 rules of crashing a wedding. Christopher Walken's serious Dad here has a hint of humor behind his eyes which is so fun to watch. But then his role is smooshed down with the rest of the mainstream Hollywood movie ending. Corny, formulaic; you see the next scene around just about every corner and laugh only because the actors are so good. I gave this a bad rating because I'm surprised that this movie has such high votes.It's funny but could have been so much better if it went the ""indie"" route and not the 'hollywood' sidewalk."
"Jim-500","4","8","16","9 August 2005"," Sorry, not very funny
","I've noticed a trend in American comedies lately. The formula is thusly: you take some somewhat well-known, sometime comedic actors, give them an unfunny script, and then sit back and ask them to make us laugh. This happened in Meet the Fokkers, Guess Who, and most recently, Wedding Crashers.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Wedding Crashers is completely awful. In fact, of the three, it's probably the funniest. But so many times, as in the other two flicks, it sets up a scene or situation that simply doesn't deliver. In a scene of touch football, for example, Vince Vaughn is laid flat on his back by the dopey villain character. He can barely breathe; but nobody seems to notice. What's so funny about that? Is he really hurt? How badly? Or is he faking? Why? The situation lingers, so we expect something additional to happen, but it doesn't. I think the trick here is that the audience feels it is supposed to laugh, so some do, even though nothing funny is happening. And then the movie goes through the same exact routine again.<br/><br/>And then there is a scene where the same evil guy shoots an innocent Vaughn in the backside with a shotgun for no reason other than anger. The payoff? We see Vaughn having the shot removed from his bare butt. This is funny?<br/><br/>The subplot of the young gay relative is excruciatingly bad. The boy is miserable, but then he is used as a whimsical anti-gay plot device. There is nothing funny about homophobic comments about a suffering young man, evenor especially when they come out of the mouth of his doddering old grandmother. If this character had been over-the-top with a lisp and designer clothes and a supremely confident and cocky attitude, it could have been funny, for it would have been teasing his flamboyancy. But here it is just cruel. <br/><br/>Christopher Walken is completely wasted in his role. He merely reads his lines; his character could have been played by anybody. When he walks into a room where Vince Vaughn is tied up in bed, we wonder if he will have some sort of witty comment or go into a creepy Christopher Walken monologue about ropes? But for some reason, he does not see the ropes, which makes no sense at all. He sits on the bed, recites some lines, and leaves. Boring.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams, on the other hand, chews the scenery in every scene she's in; I imagine her website might have crashed from all of the hits after WC opened. But she's the great one in an otherwise forgettable movie. Vaughn and Wilson have some good laughs early on, but from then on it's downhill. In a movie dealing with marriage, nothing is ever made of the fact that Vince Vaughn's love interest looks to be less than half his age. Jane Seymour's character places her into a Mrs. Robinson-styled situation with Wilson; but instead of Wilson's normal witty repartee, all he does is look scared, and the scene ends. Will Ferrell has a cameo that goes absolutely nowhere; when that situation became apparent, the director must have told him to start shouting obscenities in order to try to make it funny. <br/><br/>There is only so much one can do with a script and direction that don't deliver. You can't put people into odd situations and expect laughs unless you give them something funny to say or do. And having them yell or use dirty language does not help; instead, it smacks of desperation."

So far as the story, the only innovation is humor that is broader and bluer than usual unless you are a ""Meet the Fockers"" type of person.<br/><br/>I was interested because of the folding type: Actors playing characters who are acting roles. But that is so common now you can buy templates for your scriptwriting software.<br/><br/>Two interesting things. One is mundane: date movies usually show you nothing that doesn't advance the plot. We actually count on this fact: if we know something we expect the characters to know as well. Advancement of the story in this genre includes the necessity that that all is revealed at the end. Whatever we are told, the girl discovers at the end; it is just a matter of her catching up with us.<br/><br/>In this case, we are told horrible things about the boyfriend that remain a secret just for the audience. That's unusual and was certainly engineered.<br/><br/>The other thing, the thing I actually liked, was the extended preface. We learn that these guys crash weddings, and then for 15 or 20 minutes we attend a dozen or more with them.<br/><br/>This sort of dancing and fun usually comes at the end of a date movie. Here it is at the beginning. It is so well assembled that I think they brought in a more professional team just for that. This is so expertly edited that I even surmise that it was done later to help the movie, which is thin story-wise and ordinary in other respects.<br/><br/>Possibly some side material about the mother, the oldest daughter (whose wedding introduces the family) and the gay son was removed to make room.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

But it will make a lot of money and therefore it will encourage the release of more similar if not worse clones. The set up goes on and on for no reason. The story itself is beyond refried. From a screen writing point of view the final scene is a disgrace: it just doesn't make sense. You pay for the mostly unoriginal funny scenes with tons of predictable and/or cheesy moments. On top of that, it's way too long. Wait for the DVD. Skip that: wait for the network release. You really don't need to watch it now."
"TxMike","Null","5","9","26 January 2006"," Mostly missed opportunities to be funny.
","As one professional critic aptly wrote (Ebert) this movie is all runway and no takeoff. It apparently is right now the most popular DVD rental, and many viewers really like it, but I found it mostly odd rather than funny. It is as if the writer and director didn't really know how to make funny situations actually funny. <br/><br/>As the movie opens we see the real professions of Owen Wilson (John) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy) -- they are divorce mediators. But their real passion is the wedding season each year, where they become clever wedding crashers to pick up young attractive women who are easy prey because the wedding atmosphere softens them up. They have their approach down pat and some of their schtick is really funny.<br/><br/>Most of the movie focuses on their big challenge, crashing the party of Christopher Walken who plays the powerful Washington DC Secretary William Cleary. They do, and end up at his home, a retreat on the water. But things go wrong when (1) the younger, pretty, redhead daughter falls for Jeremy (she is described as a stage 5 clinger) and he can't shake her, then (2) John falls for the prettiest daughter Claire (very pretty Rachel McAdams). They are supposed to hit and run, but this particular situation forbids that. I felt that Jane Seymour was wasted as the wife of the Secretary, always horny and mildly chasing John. Also Will Ferrell had a small role which was particularly unfunny and ruined the rest of the movie for me.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. John and Jeremy end up falling in love with the two sisters, ending their wedding crasher hobbies."

","This is gonna be brief. I found this movie to be one of the stupidest and meaningless movies i've seen in a while. The plot was so done before. ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back"". I think the only fresh breath of air in this film was Will Ferrel. Vince Vaughns acting has to be one of the worst I've seen. He tends to overuse that whole ""what's wrong with you look"". His acting in Wedding Crashers and Dodgeball are practically the same. No real funny dialogue, but does the look to the left, look to the right, make a sarcastic remark, leaves an awkward silence. <br/><br/>You would have to ""roll a fatty"" to enjoy this one."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","4","7","3 July 2006"," A Crashing Bore...
","Wedding Crashers' storyline immediately tells you that what you are about to see isn't going to touch the heights of sophistication - it's a film about guys who crash weddings in order to get off with any hot chicks that might be available - so only the most naive of viewers would expect anything other than a lowbrow farce filled with its share of crude and sexist jokes. On this score, Wedding Crashers delivers everything you expect from it - but on all other counts it fails miserably.<br/><br/>The chief aim of any comedy, however, is to make its audience laugh, and any comedy that fails to do so must ultimately be considered a total failure. This film barely raised a smile. It never even came close to creating any genuine laughter - just an occasional bemused smile when it rehashed some lame gag that was only mildly funny when it first appeared in Porky's or Pinball Summer or some other eighties teen sex-pic. There's no two ways about it - this film stinks. The only thing it has going for it is a small measure of chemistry between its two male stars and the fact that it is technically competent.<br/><br/>Its bad points are many. The plot is entirely predictable and a good thirty minutes too long. The male leads are unsympathetic boors completely undeserving of any audience goodwill, even after their respective moments of so-called redemption, while the females they end up with are badly written and completely unbelievable. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour are completely wasted in hopelessly underwritten roles, while other characters simply flit in and out of the action with such inconsistency that you get the impression that large amounts of their screen time was sacrificed to the editor's scissors in an attempt to shorten the running time.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a big, lumbering mess that should be avoided by anyone with a fully-developed sense of humour."

The only actors who are not ""white"" are portrayed as being either ridiculously simple minded or household help (not members of ""mainstream"" society).<br/><br/>There were a few moments that I thought were funny.

He was just being a guy spewing FUNNY words. His CHARACTER thought he was funny. That to me is NOT funny.<br/><br/>Now Isla Fisher, playing the psycho-sexual Gloria, SHE was funny because her character was there all the way. She didn't let up once. She went all the way and did not come back.<br/><br/>Walken delivered his lines as though he were a legendary actor who is feared by the delivery of unfunny lines.

"Isaac5855","7","3","5","2 October 2006"," A Surpprisingly Smart and Entertaining Romantic Comedy
","WEDDING CRASHERS is a smart yet raucously funny romantic comedy that has a little more substance to it than the trailers might imply. The movie looks like a pure slapstick comedy on the surface but ends up evolving into much more. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play John Beckwith and Jeremy Gray, respectively, two DC attorneys who meet women in their spare time by crashing weddings. Why two Washington lawyers would have so much trouble meeting women that they have to crash weddings is beyond me, but I digress. John and Jeremy definitely find more than they bargained for when they crash a wedding for the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken) and get involved with the Secretary's two younger daughters. The movie is a little long, but consistently entertaining, anchored by a solid screenplay and razor-sharp performances from Wilson and Vaughn. Wilson, is a standout in particular, with a charismatic performance that could elevate him from the Stiller-Vaughn rep company to his own position as a romantic leading man. Wilson lights up the screen here and has never been more appealing on screen. Rachel McAdams is lovely as his leading lady and Walken gives one of his most beautifully underplayed performances as the Secretary. Former Bond Girl Jane Seymour is lovely as Walken's wife and looks incredible and there's a hysterical cameo by comic genius Will Ferrell that's just icing on the cake. Though the screenplay could have used a little tightening, WEDDING CRASHERS is still an entertaining trip providing solid laughs most of the way."
"sheilanagig25","1","3","5","5 March 2006"," A Waste of Time and Money
","This was possibly the worst movie since Boat Trip. It was amateur slapstick. Stupid isn't a strong enough word to describe the film. This confirms the idea that Hollywood has run out of ideas and yet believes that people will sit through just about any old garbage.<br/><br/>The premise is that two men crash weddings and are mistaken for legitimate guests. It could have been very funny if they'd chosen people who could act. It's a crying shame that they didn't.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson I can understand being in this film. They've both done their share of bad comedies, but I almost expect better from Vince Vaughn, since he shows evidence of some acting ability and comic timing. Chris Walken and Jane Seymour should just be ashamed of having taken money for appearing in it."
"bob-rutzel","2","3","5","7 January 2006"," The Hype Failed Us
","Two businessmen, partners and friends, Beckwith (Wilson), Grey (Vaughn) have a unique hobby: crashing weddings to meet girls. Seems to work for them.<br/><br/>Here's the deal: if you are young and have a group of friends watching this movie with beer, you will probably like this movie. If you eliminate the friends and the beer you must see this is a tedious movie that tries to be funny and fails. Oh, there are some funny moments to be sure, but they are few and instantly forgettable or I would relate one or two here. Just can't recall any. There are other ""funny moments"" that rely heavily on sexual circumstances. And, in some cases one or two of these circumstances are actually so crude to the point I couldn't believe the scene was happening at all. In one instance, imagine some goings on under the table at a family dinner, and as you watch there is almost nothing left to the imagination. Not for kids.<br/><br/>The only good performances were from Henry Gibson and Christopher Walken. Walken sleep-walked thru this as if to say to himself, ""Hang in there. It will be over soon."" Gibson plays the unsuspecting, but somewhat suspecting character we all love to watch. He has the old time comedians' sense or timing within him. He does a good job always. Jane Seymour was wasted in this. I don't know why she agreed to have her character with a new breast job tell Beckwith (Wilson) to feel them and once he does, she calls him a pervert. Oh, you don't see anything of hers except from a side view and a body double was probably used anyway. Nothing erotic here. Just a clumsy scene. Will Ferrell probably paid his way into this and once again showed us why he should be selling cars.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson is good at explanations and you believe everything he says, and that will get him into heaven. He is not a bad actor, but he needed someone else to play off of than Vince Vaughn. There was no chemistry between them. Vaughn is not funny, better than Ferrell, but still not funny. He delights in talking at light-speed and after the first 10-words are out you have lost any interest or meaning in what he was trying to say. You just don't care because he goes on for too long. The Director probably grooved on this. He was the only one.<br/><br/>Yes, the hype fooled me again. Going to have to do something about that, but I don't know what because I keep giving things another chance. Maybe I should get some friends and some beer and watch this again. No, once was enough, but I could use a drink about now."
"saveyoursanity","2","3","5","8 August 2005"," Could've been a lot better, if the writers had actually bothered to write, and not just trot out clichés.
","Wedding Crashers could have been a really great movie. It has a lot of funny moments, but it also has Creepy Gay Guy, and it felt morally wrong to laugh at someone who was obviously struggling with their sexuality. He's a caricature, and a lazy, unfunny one at that. The rest of the movie was, I felt, a good example of the romcom genre: funny, quirky, amusing, heart-warming, though a little gross at times... but the ""let's all laugh at the confused young gay painter who desperately wants to think a simple compliment is a come on""... that just bugged the bejesus out of me.<br/><br/>Not to mention Vaughn's character complaining about being sexually assaulted, then turning around and telling some other guy how much he loooooves the girl who ""raped"" him partially BECAUSE she raped him. It's demeaning and extremely offensive to everyone who has ever been the survivor of sexual assault, which is one out of every three women in the United States and and at least one out of every ten men."
"dtfernandes","6","3","5","21 July 2005"," Hyped
","Maybe it was because of the hype and my lofty expectations entering Wedding Crashers but overall I was disappointed with this film. While the idea is solid and there are some moments of brilliance it is ultimately ruined by a cookie cutter plot and an attempt to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. The potential of this movie is derailed during the way too frequent attempts to play to the ""chick filck"" demographic. Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrel can be some of the funniest people when left to their own devices, but I have trouble believing the claim that they were the creative forces behind most of this movie as is widely reported. Some of the funniest scenes and lines were improvisational, but these moments are definitely outnumbered by the insufferable amount of scenes that forward the ""plot."" I'm sure studios are reluctant to release films that don't have a feel-good resolution, or that are irrelevant and nonsensical, but this film is so formulaic it hurts. This movie ends up feeling as much ""50 First Dates"" as it does ""Old School."" In my opinion this movie would have been funnier, although perhaps less financially successful, if they had made it far less predictable and clichéd. Unfortunately this movie will make a good deal of money and will make the studios even more averse to producing real comedies."

Even one star should indicate something in the movie's worth seeing.<br/><br/>Well, I guess the director and photographer got paid for making this ridiculous movie. <br/><br/>This is a male fantasy of the silliest and worst kind and in my opinion it must insult anyone's intelligence whether they are male or female. The male so-called stars are crashing bores. The fairhaired one was marginally better if one has to choose because he's better looking and he did occasionally come over as human. The other one seemed to think that to be funny all he had to do was talk as fast as possible or act like a complete moron and surely we'd all roll in the aisles. He was totally unfunny, even when given anything in the script that could have been funny. I never want to see either of these persons ever again in any movie.<br/><br/>I suggest you'd only waste time watching this movie if you are a completely chauvinist male who has it in for women, or if you really like being bored out of your skull. Needless to say, after the first simply dire first fifteen mins, I simply skipped through for a while, but it never got any better. I pity anyone who has spent money on viewing this, they must be fuming and wanting a refund. Thank goodness I wasted only some of my time.

It is very well-acted, and the script is great. Both male leads are very appealing in very different ways. Vince Vaughn is very smart and quick witted. On the surface he seems uncaring, but actually turns out to be a great friend to Owen Wilson's character who also initially seems smart and self-absorbed, but is actually very sweet and vulnerable. Their different personalities compliments each other. This movie works because the story turns and twists in all kinds of different ways. Also, just when you think you have it all figured and you think you've seen this all before...you don't!

Lesson learned.<br/><br/>The chemistry between castmembers (expecially Vaughn and Wilson) is undeniable, they worked off of each other flawlessly. And Isla Fisher stole almost every scene she was in.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes were slow, with a wedding montage that didn't ever seem to end. It started to pick up a little as the movie moved into an actual plot but eventually the scenes began to drag again. About an hour and a half into the movie (it seemed more like two and a half hours) who comes along but Will Ferrell to save the end of the movie. Will Ferrell plays a supporting character that is in maybe a quarter of the film and he is the funniest character in the movie, his was the only one the audience was quoting afterwards.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know where this film went wrong, great cast, good script, funny idea in general, and several great comedic bits, but just not a funny movie.

","In this unsurprising storyline (with a comedic twist), John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince) are, ironically, wedding counselors/mediators who look forward to weddings more than Christmas. Why? Because weddings give them a chance to take advantage of emotionally vulnerable women, feast on free food, dance all night, and take their libido to the next level. Both are stylish, smooth talking mid/late 30 somethings that have bedposts notched neck high. The film and editing are fast and furious until John has a moment of clarity and falls for Claire (played beautifully by the modest Rachel McAdams), the daughter of a powerful senator. Claire is in a relationship and this only heightens the chase. It's this moment, when we discover that John really is more than meets the eye that the film starts to turn a corner into ""serious comedy"" and all the gut-busting humor is left behind. Bit roles by Christopher Walken and Will Farrell can't save this movie from going stale. The ending is tied neatly in a bow, and with all the hype and potential, the morning after leaves a dull headache."

Children, especially under 13 even with adult supervision is highly recommended due to language, and very sexually suggestive material and nudity which I might add, bring the movie its funniest moments.<br/><br/>One of the best movies I have seen of the summer, real good fun, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are great and work off each other very well. Vaughn has some great lines. I am certainly going to buy the DVD! The female stars, especially Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher carry the other half and do an exceptional job - they are beautiful. Jane Seymour, always a knockout, is great in a comedy role outside of her normal acting role (drama).<br/><br/>Christopher Walken plays a role within his normal roles, that of a slightly quirky individual.<br/><br/>Will Farrell almost has a cameo, but why he was selected is anybody's guess since anyone could have carried the role with no problem.

The preview wasn't as exciting as I expected, but I have always been fun of Wilson and Vaughn, and who could resist the pairing of Walken and Seymour? So I decided to spend my hard earned money and partake of the communal experience. In the end, I have to say that I wasn't completely disappointed because this film has some truly hilarious moments, and the chemistry between some of the principals works very well. It even has some classy cinematography and art direction... even some really good acting.<br/><br/>The concept behind he film works very well because there is the depiction of friendship and the various relationships in the family members feels real and honest; though leaving out the artistic brother wouldn't have made much of an impact.<br/><br/>Wilson and McAdams have work very well together, taking us along as they develop a sweet and touching relationship. There are some genuinely touching moments as they take simple walks along the fantastic estates.<br/><br/>True, I attended this film, expecting a raunchy, crass, hilarious, and downright bawdy time, and there were scenes that fulfilled my expectations. What made me enjoy the movie even more was that the filmmakers considered that taking those aspects too far would have resulted in overkill and another dumb teenager flick. Their film was 90% good, and I just wished that the unexpected and rather unwelcome one-note cameo in the movie had been taken out. It wasn't necessary, reeked of lack of talent and almost sank the film. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good actors and comedians, capable of emoting emotions beyond loud and simian screams. Maybe the inclusion of the character in question will highlight this performer's fault and lead to his eventual removal from a business that has suffered in the past year of lack of originality and too much reliance in marketing research that takes the usual way out. True, a series like ""Faces of Death"" provokes some type of sick attraction, but that doesn't necessarily reflect quality or talent. Please, stop overpaying vulgar and simplistic performers and bring back what really works: talent."

","We go to the movies for entertainment and enjoyment and a few laughs. This movie is one of the funniest we have ever seen. It is pure fun from start to finish. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have a franchise movie here, one that should continue on for many sequels. Christopher Walkin is spectacular as is the very gorgeous Jane Seymour. Belly laughs and toilet humor are simply out of this world and the girls are all gorgeous. I know that every boy and girl of age will absolutely fall in love with these guys and gals. Don't miss it. It is surely one of the funniest movies of the year. The young starlets in the movie are equal to the task as foils for the boys. The concept is brilliant and it works just fine.. Not for those under 13 but a don't miss for those 14-96.. have fun."

","Two guys crashing weddings for the free booze, the free food, and easy women. A premise that'll make most men over the age of 35 wonder: ""Why the hell didn't I think of that?"" With a plot as thin as this it would be easy for this movie to fail and fall as flat as your drunken uncle Devin at the last family reunion. It doesn't. Despite the fact that this movie takes the typical roads and the characters learn life lessons and fall in love this movie has a ton of laughs.<br/><br/>Watching these guys lie, cheat, and woo, it's easy to see just how much fun everyone had making this movie. Owen and Vince bounce improvised moments each other in a comedic symbiosis few can match. You can make a solid bet you'll see an unrated DVD later packed with hours of these two just firing off lines. Chris Walken feels a little under used in this movie, but it's hard to pay attention when his nymphomaniac daughter played by Isla Fischer is stealing nearly every scene she's in. Jane Seymour basically channels Mrs. Robinson for the few brief moments she registers in this movie but the scenes are funny and quick and seemed to have been part of some deleted sub plot that got dropped. Rachel McAdams part is pretty standard, she's the love interest but her character has the least going on. It's not that she's bad she just wasn't given much to do that would make her stand out in this family tree of nuts.<br/><br/>This is the wingman/buddy picture this summer was sorely missing. You'd have to be pretty uptight not to get some chuckles out of this one.<br/><br/>Sacul OUT!"

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>First off, the story starts off with a bang. It is funny clever and most importantly original. The characters are easy to connect with and the dialogue is great. The jokes are solid and the romantic plot line is well thought out.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, Jane Seymor, Bradley Cooper, and Will Ferrel all perform great.<br/><br/>The pacing starts off very fast but slows down towards the middle and the end. The runtime is a little overlong as well.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best comedies of the 21st century. It belong in the ranks of The 40 Year Old Virgin, 21 Jump Street, and Superbad.<br/><br/>Pros: Funny jokes, great characters, original story, good romantic plot line, and great acting<br/><br/>Cons: Slow pacing in the middle and the end and an overlong runtime<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.0"

"eshwarmail","4","2","3","28 October 2012"," Too long, too overrated, hardly any fun
","While it has its moments of incredible, the entire movie structure, characters and plot twists feels like just another Owen Wilson movie. I believe this was the last successful movie this band of comics have produced where the mantle has been long passed on to Judd Apatow's protégées Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jason Segal and Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are buddies who crash into weddings taking advantage of the romantic air and single women. During one of their stints they end up in Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) eldest daughter's wedding and make their move on his two younger daughters Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher). When John starts to have feelings for Claire, they go deeper than they have always trained themselves to be.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn generates most laughs and best lines in the movie with incredible timing while Wilson was on auto-pilot doing his usual stuff. The brand of comedy is nothing you have not seen before and the most jokes have already been told in different phrasings in other movies. All the characters are stereotypes or caricatures of an ethnicity or social background they belong to, screenplay is too convenient and the movie is a good 40 minutes too long. <br/><br/>Too long, too overrated, hardly any fun"

"Bravesfan17","9","2","3","26 May 2010"," One of the best comedies ever made
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are one of the best comedy duos in the history of comedies, and they prove it here. They star as John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, two divorce mediators who like to spend their time crashing weddings and meeting girls. Wilson and Vaughn show us that they are the best in crashing weddings and becoming the life of the party. They also show that they are the best in getting away with what they do after meeting girls. Wilson and Vaughn take these two characters and make them their own.<br/><br/>Director David Dobkin shows us his brilliance and originality in this story and what can happen when they become attached to one wedding that they crash. Dobkin knows how to play the scenes for laughs and give the viewers a fun movie to watch. He also makes us want to enjoy ourselves and become attached to the story.<br/><br/>Vaughn becomes attached to one sister of a bride and Wilson becomes attached to another sister. Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams play the said sisters. Fisher stands out in making Gloria her own. Fisher makes us like Gloria, yet find her incredibly crazy. McAdams does a fine job in her role as Claire, but she isn't given a whole lot to do. McAdams does a good job in making us want to know more about Claire like John does.<br/><br/>David Dobkin does a great job with this movie and shows us brilliance when working with two of the best comedy actors out there, having worked with each of them before this movie. Dobkin directed Wilson in Shanghai Knights and Vaughn in Clay Pigeons.<br/><br/>This is among some of the best comedies ever made. It is well worth spending two hours on watching if you are a fan of Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, or any other Frat Pack comedies."
"davggsco","8","2","3","22 June 2009"," A Wavy Davy Review - Wedding Crashers
","John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) are two divorce mediators from Washington who carry out the immature activity of crashing weddings. Their mission - to eat food, hook up with women and generally have a good time. Problems arise when John falls for Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), daughter of senator John Cleary (Christopher Walken), while Jeremy is left with the crazy daughter, Gloria (Isla Fischer).<br/><br/>This comedy feels fresh due to its likable cast and varied nature of the jokes. While the plot is quite formulaic, the gags generally work, and even Christopher Walken cannot ruin this. In a time while the legendary actor seems to be taking roles crazily, this film actually fits him well, straying away from his routine evil mode.<br/><br/>There are some elements to this film which make it a highly enjoyable watch. The likability of the funny Wilson and Vaughn despite their sleazy lives creates a genuine interest in how events will pan out. There are some really cheesy, yet enjoyable romantic asides, especially between Wilson and McAdams, although Isla Fischers over the top Gloria is less enjoyable.<br/><br/>There are extremely funny small roles, which keeps the film moving along and keeps the level of laughs high. Christopher Walken's wife and son have some very funny scenes which are unexpected and refreshing. The cherry on the top, however, is a hilarious role from Will Ferrell as Chazz Reinhold, the creator of crashing weddings. This film is worthwhile just to see his very funny portrayal which lifts the movie to its obvious, up-beat ending.<br/><br/>The charisma of Wilson and Vaughn, aided by Walken and, latterly, Ferrel, make this film a superior comedy, encouraging me to give it 8/10."
"charchuk","6","2","3","8 January 2008"," A mixed bag of funny
","It's really a schizophrenic comedy, alternating between some of the funniest stuff ever put on film (basically, Vince Vaughn) and some really awkward, really unfunny pseudo-emo/romance stuff (basically, Owen Wilson). The first act is pretty solid, not really overly funny, but not terrible either - it sets up the story well. This allows the second act to go all out, and it pretty much does, as this is pretty much the funniest half hour of cinema perhaps ever. Unfortunately, this leads into the brutally awful third act, which is painfully unfunny and also quite disturbing. Not just because of Wilson's darkly ironic glamourized depression, but also Will Ferrell's way too dark cameo that makes one feel uncomfortable, not amused. And of course, it all culminates in a predictably corny finish. Overall, just a mixed bag of funny."
"dfivothree","2","2","3","8 October 2007"," Hilarious, etc.
","A two hour long wedding/romantic comedy featuring some of our finest Hollywood comedic geniuses...<br/><br/>That should be sufficient warning for anyone who has an ounce of movie-viewing savvy. (Luckily, I keep an MP3 player tucked away in my shirt pocket for just such occasions. It wasn't my pick.)<br/><br/>I did keep an eye on the screen in hope of at least one redeeming T&A shot, which you'd think would be obligatory to this genre; but the 'guys' who make movies nowadays aren't even good at that anymore. Not that any of the actresses were capable of it anyway. I half expected the old grandma to strip off. Thank god she didn't; or maybe I was just lucky and missed that scene."
"RafiSteinger","10","2","3","11 March 2007"," Not just Comedy Genius, but a realistic look at American culture
","While this movie has reached critical acclaim, many people don't realize the realism behind the scenes. While these realisms are significant, many examples come from the very small specifics behind the acting and scenarios. A significant part of the success of this movie is the ability of the story to relate to modern day American single males ages 18-35. The movie portrays 2 men who are sexually motivated in their extra-curricular activities. The movie does a wonderful example of portraying American cultural flaws through classism, culturalism, and sexuality. Particularly, the movie shows the consistencies between money, family, relationships, and their effects on one another.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of this movie is the fact that every character is properly cast, and provide brilliant performances. Even a late cameo by a reknown star provides effective enough humor for the hysterical atmosphere; although most would argue that the cameo isn't meant to be taken seriously. While the movie does drag on a bit towards the end, it provides effective entertainment all the way through.<br/><br/>The only shortcoming behind this movie is the fact that many older crowds won't be able to relate to the material at all. In fact, many of the elderly crowds won't want to accept many of the cultural portrayals as reality seeing as though there is satirical implications to the upper class and the male sex drive. Additionally, women (usually older women as younger women now have commonly reformed to open sexuality or befriending Men who relate to these characters) won't be able to relate to the characters or necessarily want to sympathize with them due to their sexual motivations; the main characters while being portrayed as ""heroes"", in theory are motivated in a sleezy fashion.<br/><br/>Overall, most people don't recognize that the reason why these jokes work, is the ability to make fun of the cultural identifiers that people recognize about the upper class and men looking to have a good time. This movie should be cherished by anyone who's looking for a good comedy. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this movie can't relate to it, and doesn't want to accept these characters as realistic."

They crash weddings in order to pick up chicks. After crashing the secretaries wedding, they both fall for his two beautiful daughters. Having to spend a weekend with them, they try to get them to fall in love with them too. Well, sorta. Reverse that with Jeremies girlfriend.<br/><br/>This movie has all the right ingredients. There are tits in the movie, how-ever, not some steamy sex scene, the one where you feel un-comfortable watching the movie with your parents, its a brief shot of the tits, so its not over-done.<br/><br/>The comedy is hilarious. The jokes flow well, and both characters, although different, make jokes of the same caliber. So many quotes came out of this movie that I repeat around my friends, such as, ""Did you play the motor-boat?"". Its priceless.<br/><br/>The girls are really hot. Especially Gloria, but I have a weakness for red-heads. Rachel McAdams is looking good as ever, and the extras seen at the wedding look good as well.<br/><br/>The music flows well with whats going on in the movie. And the characters are all unique and funny in there own way.<br/><br/>Over-all, WATCH THIS MOVIE! It is well worth it. 10 out of 10"

There's nothing new or surprising here, and unfortunately is generally un-funny. It's about as bad as Old SchooI, and I don't think I laughed once. The script is a perfect example of bad writing, no plot logic, and predictability.<br/><br/>When will these film executives stop funding forgettable work like this?

What should have been a hilarious comedy based on the concept and stellar cast, makes a left turn and becomes a morose corny sentimental who-cares journey that leaves one wanting their money back. The genius of Walken is totally wasted, the middle hour or more of the movie just lugs along clumsily with very little humor, although the scenes themselves offered numerous chances to be really funny. By the time Will Ferrell enters the screen as cameo role, it's too little too late, though I do think he was the funniest thing about the whole movie. I put this comedy disaster on the director's feet, the cast and script had a lot going for it, but the direction and way the movie was shot and edited was not comedic at all."

","The thing that attracted me to this movie is the fact that it stars two of the funniest men in Hollywood today. Now, the movie was very funny at the beginning, and then, it just gradually slumped down a bit, but that's okay. The reason this is okay is because since Owen Wilson brings the movie's comedy down a bit, Vince Vaughn is there to kick it up two notches higher each time. Of course, a movie always has to have the straight-laced guy, and then the crazy/hilarious guy. This movie also had one of the hottest girls in the movie business today...Rachel McAdams. There is much more comedy that there is romance in this comedy, but still, it has some kinda dramatic scenes in the end. They're not heartbreaking scenes, they're just kinda depressing. But, this movie did make me laugh a whole lot, so I really recommend it to anyone who likes Old School. And if you didn't like Old School, you might like this one. Give it a try."
"elena_99","1","2","3","12 October 2005"," Wedding Crashers
","Wedding Crashers is, without any doubt , the kind of movie everybody would have claim against years ago.But is also the kind of movie people loves to watch nowadays. If we should compare it with titles such as Danny Leiner's ""Dude,where is my car?"" or any of the Mike Mitchell's Gigolo's series , Wedding Crashers is not that bad. At least, we couldn't expect any further from Owen Wilson, who seems incapable of thinking about cinema industry as an art (nor even as a noble and decent way of earning money). Director David Dobkin, presents us two of the most disgusting characters ever seen on the big (or even small)screen. This movie's most likely intention responds to Dobkin's wish to make some more money thanks to a bunch of single thirty-something middle-class living with- their -mums -or -not men and brainless teenagers who liked his ""Shanghai Knights""and who see in Owen's characters their own alter-ego. But the worst part about Wedding Crashers is to see how Vince Vaugh is capable of making us forget his remarkable performance in Tarsem Sigh's ""The Cell"" by reminding us his ""work"" in Todd Phillips' ""Starsky and Hutch"", again with Owen around. Dobkin's next work will be ""Jack"", a story about a farm boy who leaves the roost to become a soldier. Let's hope Owen won't be that farm boyor should I say fear?."

"baumer","9","2","3","15 September 2005"," The funniest film of the year!
","THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!! <br/><br/>There was a period during the late 80's to early 90's when there was a very tangible dry spell for horror films. Then Scream exploded onto the scene and horror films have enjoyed a very healthy recrudescence for the last ten years. I feel the same can be said for comedies. While there certainly have been some very funny ones in the last ten years ( Something About Mary, American Pie, Zoolander ) for the most part, everything feels like it is has been recycled ad nausea. But then you get something refreshing and original like The Wedding Crashers and it restores your faith in Hollywood.<br/><br/>People say that there are eleven stories that Hollywood tells over and over again, in various forms of course with a few idiosyncrasies to give them an original feel. The Usual Suspects in the twelfth story and Wedding Crashers is the thirteenth. This is a romantic comedy for sure and it is rather silly in some areas, but if you want to just laugh out loud and have a lot of fun, then this is about as sure fire a hit that Hollywood has produced in quite sometime.<br/><br/>What makes the film so enjoyable is the writing of course, but to pull it off, you need the right cast. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and a surprisingly complete performance by Rachael McAdams make this film a treat and a hoot to experience.<br/><br/>I have to admit that part of my zeal for the film has to do with the fact that Vince Vaughn's character, Jeremy Grey, is an extension of his character Trent Walker from Swingers. Vaughn made a name for himself in the indie hit of 1996 as the motor mouthed, quick thinking, loyal best friend of Mike Peters. His performance as the eccentric playboy is what put him on the Hollywood radar and it was his performance in Swingers that got him a role in Jurassic Park II. Jeremy is Trent all grows up. It's what he would have become. I'm sure this was by design and it works to perfection. This is Vaughn's movie. Owen Wilson is very nice as well and he gets top billing and the bigger paycheck, but make no mistake about it, this is Vaughn's vehicle start to finish.<br/><br/>As funny as the film is and as sublime a performance as Vaughn gives, the other part of the film that works to perfection is the romance between Wilson and McAdams. There is a sweetness to it and that works because McAdams is so fresh and exciting to watch on screen. She has a definitive presence and when she is on screen you care about her. She was like that in The Notebook and also in Red Eye. She is one of the bright new stars of Hollywood and I look forward to anything else she does.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is about as laugh out loud funny as you are going to get and even though it might go on for about 10 minutes too long, those 10 minutes have the cameo that we were all waiting for and that justifies the length.<br/><br/>In the last few years, films like Zoolander, Meet The Parents, Old School, Anchorman, Starsky and Hutch and Dodgeball have pretty much been the funniest films of their respective years. Wedding Crashers adds to the Frat Pack's legacy and doe not disappoint.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I should have loved this movie. The cast was wonderful (each of the characters were caricature's of people we all know). Usually, I see one actor that stands out from the rest, but I think all the performances were stand out performances. The jokes went from witty to outrageous (the scene at the table was really well done!) But I didn't love this movie. I found that some of the scenes dragged a bit, and some of the jokes bordered on bad taste (A FUNERAL crasher?!?) and the movie went into painful and exceedingly bitter at times.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is a good movie to see when you want a nonsense movie with a heart!"
"triple8","8","2","3","4 September 2005"," Just when one thinks comedy is extinct, Wedding Crashers crashes on to the big screen ....
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br/><br/>The Wedding Crashers is definitely not for everyone but I thought it was one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years. And that's not an exaggeration because there were truly times I thought I'd have to leave the theater I was laughing so hard. This isn't an Oscar contender, it's a funny contender.<br/><br/>One problem with a lot of Comedies is that there is one person who usually gets the funny lines and that's it. All the humor revolves around that person. Not so here. Wedding crashers is chock full of hilarious off the wall people and they all get their moment (or moments) to let the comedy rip. It's a movie that has consistently funny things happening constantly and that's a rarity in the comedy genre.<br/><br/>The amount of comedy here is strong and there are a few scenes that may have made me laugh harder then I ever have in the theater-particularly a certain dinner scene starring Vince Vaughn and Isla Fisher. Okay-this movie has made100 maybe 200 million already so it stands to reason I should have expected something really funny but I didn't. I thought I'd be under whelmed.<br/><br/>All the performers were great but I must single out Isla Fisher who played Gloria. She has a great future as one of the best comedic actresses I have ever seen. I loved Jane Seymour in this and Rachel Mc.Adams-well what can one say-she is so lovely and talented she creates such a realistic character in an off the wall comedy. One day this woman will win an Oscar, that's practically a given.<br/><br/>The men were great too, although Walkin was somewhat underused. Vince Vaughn is the next Jim Carey and Owen Wilson surprised me in that he played the romantic lead with such finesse. Everyone was cast perfectly.<br/><br/>I have no problem giving comedies 9's or even 10's if their flawless. This wasn't though. Even though I loved it, it had flaws. There was NOTHING that was off limits in the movie's almost satirical tone. There were some things that were more cruel then funny. A few scenes where the guys were getting hit, beat up and shot were rather gross. And the crashing funerals....well, I know it's central to the movie's premise and overall resolution but I did think it was a bit much as was the reference to Jodie Foster's character in The Accused which for some reason rubbed me the wrong way as well. This is not a movie to see if one's easily offended. Actually, even People who AREN'T easily offended may have problems because the movie's comedy simply touches on to many areas someone might consider off limits, it's almost inevitable that one will get offended about something unless one's tolerance level is really high.<br/><br/>I also think the last half hour or so became a bit to soppy. This movie, in a way, started to remind me of a sicker more twisted version of Sideways-or maybe The Wedding Singer. Or maybe both. I don't think a comedy at this level can really aspire to also be THAT sweetly sentimental because then the level of humor goes way down. I did appreciate the happy ending, this movie almost guarantees that, but the brief period the two friends are estranged wasn't really needed-or anyway it didn't need to be that bleak. Not after what the audience sees for the first ninety minutes.<br/><br/>In spite of the flaws-this is an 8.5 (at least) and definitely a movie I will recommend, watch again myself AND may have to own when it comes to DVD. My vote on this rowdy, twisted, unrealistic, strange and totally hilarious comedy is 8.5 out of 10."
"almonetts","7","2","3","3 September 2005"," A crudely constructed comedy that delivers genuine laughs most times
","Directed by David Dobkin; starring the comic duo of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, Crashers is a crudely constructed comedy that delivers genuine laughs most times, seemingly due to the improvisational nature of its stars and the director's willingness to let them run wild. <br/><br/>The two play divorce mediators who live for weddings and the opportunity to womanize. They perfect the art of crashing weddings using great lines, dance moves and plays to bed the ladies. The movie presents almost every single wedding cliché and destroys them, with often hilarious results. Some of the best scenes are contained within these wedding montages. <br/><br/>Vaughn shines, as he is tossed into a series of unfortunate scenarios, which are almost uncomfortable to watch, but painstakingly delivers good laughs. When paired up with Isla Fisher, the movie's laugh factor hits a great high. <br/><br/>The film detours just after the first half with a dramatic/romance angle, which works on the sole merit of Wilson and Rachel McAdams' (The Notebook, Red Eye) chemistry. However, for a movie which debunks a lot of clichés, it is disappointing to see it go down the formulaic path with this story arch. The jokes become few and far between. Admittedly, witnessing the talent of McAdams compensates in this regard, but not enough. At two hours and then some, the movie becomes weighty. <br/><br/>While it delivers on some laughs and allows the cast sufficient leeway, under a more skillful director and a tighter script, this may have evolved into a comedy classic."

No subtext, I have seen more genuine emotion and better acting in a Ford commercial. Rachel McAdams tries, but the script ties her hands. Fact is, ""Sack Lodge"" is so over the top nuts, there is no way Claire would ever date him. And Owen Wilson is such a wimp, who cares if they ever hook up.

"Hey_Sweden","7","1","1","12 June 2019"," An engaging romantic comedy.
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make a good team as John and Jeremy, two serial womanizers who regularly crash weddings to pick up girls. This has been their tradition for a while, but things go awry when they crash the wedding of the eldest daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken). John finds himself falling hard for Claire, daughter # 2 (a radiant Rachel McAdams), and Jeremy gets targeted by Gloria, daughter # 3 (Isla Fisher), a ""stage five clinger"" who develops a serious infatuation with him.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Wedding Crashers"" is a fun, if overlong, movie that delivers enough good laughs to keep it watchable. Some of the humour is of course pretty raunchy, and some of the dialogue rather colourful, but there are some amusing moments. Glorias' late-night bout of kinkiness is a good example.<br/><br/>John and Jeremy are characters who might have run the risk of coming off as incredibly sleazy, but Wilson and Vaughn never overdo it, and their amiability does go a long way. But the real value of ""Wedding Crashers"" is that it offers good comic opportunities for many cast members. Walken is effective, sometimes edging into typical Walken-esque eccentricities, but also making sure to project some actual sense of authority and intimidation. The gorgeous McAdams is ideal, and it's not hard to see why the John character would be so taken with her. Fisher is hilarious as the seemingly unhinged, spoiled-rotten Gloria.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, a few years before ""The Hangover"", portrays the arrogant rich jerk who's actually been dating Claire, and the fact that she clearly shouldn't be with him is obvious from the get-go. Jane Seymour is a hoot as Walkens' hot-to-trot wife. Ellen Albertini Dow is fun as his cranky, foul-mouthed mother. And Ron Canada, as the butler, gets to deliver some priceless lines. Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca DeMornay have cameo roles in the opening minutes; there's also a special (unbilled) guest star who pops up towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>""Wedding Crashers"" is ultimately plenty predictable, but getting to the end is still a reasonably good time, and there's enough emotional content to keep things on a fairly even keel.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","... so much fun. Yeah, plot is thin, there are no special effects, there's nothing new to see here, but it's a great date movie. I always enjoy Christopher Walken on screen. I normally can't stand Owen Wilson, but he's a bit more subdued here and the role fits him.<br/><br/>For those who like to analyze movies, let's get to the point: The first 6-7 minutes of the movie give us a riotous montage of our two protagonists doing what they do best: picking up chicks. It's rubbed in our faces. This totally frees us to spend the rest of the movie enjoying watching our heroes pulled out of their comfort zones and having to cope with... OMG! relationships! Bag o' popcorn and snacks, some beer and/or wine, S.O. or a few good friends over for movie night and this is a good choice. It's not ""Citizen Cain"" nor ""Shawshank Redemption,"" but it's a good movie."

","In my opinion Wedding Crashers is about 90 percent a good fairly enjoyable comedy. And about ten percent a God awful one. The 90 percent because Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are two wonderfully charming comedic actors, while their performances aren't anything exceptional they're still pretty funny and likable. I especially thought Vince Vaughn's scenes with Isla Fisher were hilarious, including the infamous scene when she ties her too his bed while hes asleep. Christopher Walken is also there, where he is once again playing Christopher Walken, but that's OK because I like Christopher Walken up to a certain point anyway and hes just as quirky and funny as ever. But the ten percent of Wedding Crashers which stops it from being a fully enjoyable comedy, is the pointless ""cameo"" of Will Unfunny Cunting Ferrell towards the end. What the hell was he even doing in this movie? His part was pretty superfluous and I can almost picture the director waiting off screen waving his pay cheque. Aside from that though Wedding Crashers is pretty good. <br/><br/>6/10"

Until Owen's character falls for Rachel McAdams' character at a big time society wedding. Invited back to the upmarket home of Secretary Cleary (as played by Christopher Walken who really should know a lot better). Jane Seymour crashes and burns as Walken's nymphomaniac wife. The story is by turns ridiculous and desperate, the jokes old and stale or non-existent, everyone is crazy, and it's all so manic you give up trying to work out what's going on after about fifteen minutes. I can take zany comedy, make it as screwball as you like, great, just love it. But this? Oh my god. The big sting in the tail is that everyone in the film is totally dishonest, about everything.

","They have a strict 'crashers rulebook', which dictates the etiquette of the pick-up, such as 'never use your real name'. It also suggests, by behaving raucously, loudly and generally being the life-and-soul, people will think you're so obnoxious, you can't not have been invited.<br/><br/>The pair eventually find themselves at odds with each other when John meets and falls for a bridesmaid at the Washington society wedding of the year.<br/><br/>Although ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com cliché. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","1","7 April 2009"," Perhaps It's THE Funniest Wedding Comedy
","David Dobkins's 'Wedding Crashers' is a laugh riot right from the start. Pretty much all the jokes are laugh out loud hilarious. It is an over-the-top comedy but what makes this one miles ahead of the likes of 'Meet The Parents', 'Bedazzled' etc is that the comic tracks fit the story and the film itself has excellent repeat value (which isn't easy with comedy). I had seen it in theatres during first viewing but even today it felt just as fresh. The story itself is quite new.<br/><br/>While the dialogues and situations are highly amusing, a comedy movie requires actors with comic flair and everyone here is wonderfully cast. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are awesome as the crasher duo. The two actors appear to be really comfortable to work together and their off-screen friendship may have something to do with how well they click together on screen. The ravishing Rachel McAdams is cast as Wilson's love interest and she doesn't have much to do with comedy but nonetheless delivers a charming performance. Then there is a cute Isla Fisher as the oversexed, clingy, wild 'virgin', a sizzling Jane Seymour as the gorgeous but sexually starved hot mom and of course a delightful Christopher Walken as the clueless dad. There's also a funny appearance by Rebecca DeMornay at the beginning.<br/><br/>The film also succeeds on the technical side. The sets look quite nice and rich. The music is comprised of an eclectic soundtrack and adds energy. The camera-work and editing is great.<br/><br/>'Wedding Crashers' is funny as hell, perhaps one of my favourite over the top comedies from Hollywood, perhaps THE best wedding comedy. The humour is very adult thus watching it with your parents or with little children isn't exactly advisable but otherwise I'd recommend to watch the uncut version for more surprises."

","WEDDING CRASHERS, like American PIE, is a movie with sufficient charm to undermine the clearly juvenile activities of the lead characters, whose sole purpose at the outset is to bed as many women as possible from the wedding receptions that they gatecrash. A previous generation might have flocked to see similar proceedings in PORKY'S, although there isn't nearly as much nudity in this film, save for the occasional visual near the beginning.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson excel as divorce lawyers who welcome Wedding Season with gusto and come up with all manner of ploys and plays in their own 'Wedding Crasher' play-book. Complications start to set in when familiar faces from previous weddings turn up and they have to defer them from going any further.<br/><br/>Even greater problems begin when they crash the Superbowl of weddings, a society function involving the daughter of a top Senator (Christopher Walken, in excellent form) and Wilson finds himself falling for one of the two, Claire (the delectably gorgeous Rachel McAdams), whilst Vaughn has to contend with her 'STAGE 5 CLINGER' sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher, in a brilliant standout performance) and a rather morose brother with an eye for painting with blood. Claire is already engaged to somebody, but Wilson and Vaughn, at the cajoling and convincing of Gloria, head off for a weekend to get to know their respective suitors better.<br/><br/>WEDDING CRASHERS works at it's best when it is screwball and despite the simplistic plot, has sufficient charm and humour to offset the sentiment that creeps in from time to time.

","Another romantic comedy that is just not up to par. Let's start with romantic - Owen Wilson's character doesn't have to work very hard to be with the girl. Zak is obnoxious from the off, there is NO REASON this woman would be with him. We don't respect her for that choice, so we don't respect Owen Wilson choosing her. And the climactic scene - could they be more obvious in ripping off Four Wedings and a Funeral? Unfortunately, the comedy also falls flat - Vince Vaughn, who I liked in The Break-Up, is really forcing his humour here. All his lines seem contrived, like he is trying too hard. The quail hunt was the first time I smiled, and thank God for Will Ferrell, who livens things up with his cameo. There's a nice little montage for Wilson's lost days near the end, but there are no laugh-out-loud moments like There's Something About Mary or Four Weddings. As for the other stock characters, it was great to see Jane Seymour as smoldering as ever but she is wasted as the horny mum. Foul-mouthed granny was cringe- inducing, while the gay little brother was out of sync with the feel of the film. Only the scary little sister was a worthy creation. In short, a worthy cast ill-served by a poor script."

","I have a huge appreciation for Rachel McAdams, I think she is fantastic actress and hope she has a long and movie-filled career. McAdams was my main reason for watching this film, although I had many people tell me how good it was. I, however, was not overly impressed. Although I think Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good comedians, I felt that their performances here were sub-par, and their characters could have been played by any member of the ""Frat Pack"", or another comedian too.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is an interesting idea, it basically consists of John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) crashing weddings to hook up with chicks. Eventually, after a long opening scene, they crash the wedding of an important family - the Cleary's - and John falls for Claire (McAdams), who is engaged to Zachary Lodge (played by the hilarious and gorgeous Bradley Cooper) who is arrogant and controlling, while Jeremy becomes subject to the unwanted attentions of Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher of ""Home & Away"" fame, who gives a terrific performance here).<br/><br/>The typical antics follow, with the guys dealing with their respective situations, and eventually having a fall-out between themselves, though the movie closes with a happy ending all 'round, well, for most people. The film was highly predictable, and at times boring. The rest of the cast were mixed - Christopher Walken gives the first performance of his that I actually liked, the lovely Jane Seymour was severely under-used, Will Ferrell was annoying, Keir O'Donnell's character was rather pointless and poor Rebecca DeMornay, why she subjected herself to such a bit part is beyond me.<br/><br/>Watch this film if you like, but you may be subjected to severe boredom.

","Two hours into Wedding Crashers, Will Farrell appeared as Chazz Reinhold and true comic mastery ensued. Till then, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn struggled to hold up what is essentially a 19th Century parlor farce. Wedding are funny or at least ironic because they promise what is essentially impossible, ""perfect union"" between man and woman. As all successful married couples know, divorce or murder is a toilet seat-up-moment away.<br/><br/>Farce or screwball comedy introduces stressful situations and cross-purpose motivations amidst a large cast of diverse characters. They bounce off each other as if billiard balls. Wilson and Vaughn crash weddings to bed teary-eyed women in a moment of marital insecurity. The bride has her man, but what of the single gals? They are society's failures. They are also horny; hence, the premise of the film. We laugh at the Senator's family, each one a character except for Owen's new love, Claire. She's like Marilyn in the Munsters, normal, while her nympho sister, Claire's jock-nut fiancé, the insane-gay-artiste bro, and all the bedded bimbos, are nuts.<br/><br/>Hollywood used to produce screwball comedies during the Depression years to cheer folks up. Carole Lombard, Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Clark Gable all took a turn at the misunderstandings that create situation comedy, farce. Perhaps we need cheering up again.

","OK, maybe I overexaggerated on the title of the review by comparing it to the master himself, but it was waaaaaay above the typical romantic comedy made in the last few years, maybe the whole decade. I actually have to disagree with the other reviews which said that the movie hangs strong mostly because of the actors. This is among the most witty-written simple comedy I've ever seen. The setup is rather typical, though the main idea is relatively new; at least it hasn't been copied too many times, and none that I can think of. This is also one of the few films, if not the only one, where Christopher Walkens was cast, but as brilliant as he is, his talent wasn't as put to the test as much as usual, and the movie does not live because of it, but because of the excellent plot. He just makes the great lines sound exactly as they should sound, which is what he's good at. The two main characters are great. And some of the lines seemed to be written with a thought of how they would sound with those particular actors, I believe. Last but now least, this is a rare comedy for the corny parts actually feel solid and relatable (for lack of better word). As much as directors love to overdo the romance and the music and crying that goes with it, this director kept it with only the necessary elements; no extra emotions. Never thought such a simple comedy could get me so plugged into it. But it did. So, watch it! Never know when the next decent romance will come. :)"

A lot of the comedy is purile and stupid, but it still manages to be funny. A huge amount of the credit for that goes down to Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson: two naturally funny people who work extremely well together. You get the impression that a lot of the jokes came directly from them - or if not then the writer did a great job of judging the people they were writing for. It all feels very natural and that makes it very easy to laugh where you're supposed to laugh and cringe where you're supposed to cringe.<br/><br/>All the actors do a good job of playing the parts they were assigned and they've managed to squeeze a love story into this shameless smut vehicle without it getting too gooey and sentimental (which would have felt completely out of place).<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting too much, but I was most impressed.

","Wedding crashers, about two guys who invite themselves to weddings to hook up with women, is crude, filthy raunch. I loved it! There's nothing more beautiful and romantic than taking the maid of honor to bed during the reception. But I digress.<br/><br/>Thanks in no small part to the excellent on-screen chemistry of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, the movie is a few notches above typical lowest-common-denominator fare. Oh, let's be honest - Pride and Prejudice, this ain't. But in its own idiom, Wedding Crashers is just plain good laugh out loud comedy.<br/><br/>So this is what John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) do. They get into their nice suits and crash weddings AND receptions. They cozy up to the hot guests, make balloon animals, dance, flirt, and eventually wind up with someone. And the next day or weekend, they do it again. Then one day John falls for his mark, Claire (Rachel McAdams), the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken). Oops; in violation of all of their rules of wedding crashing, the boys spend the weekend with the secretary and his upper-crust family. Claire's engaged to be engaged to Sack, who's thoroughly obnoxious and creepy. You know, just in case you thought she'd have to really choose between him and John, who's, well, Owen Wilson.<br/><br/>Also thrown into the mix are Claire's younger sister Gloria, who has the hots for Jeremy - and who may or may not be a virgin; her brother Todd, a bitter, repressed artist; her mom, played by the usually prim Jane Seymour, who has the hots for Jeremy, too; a gramma, and a wise and all knowing butler. It's madcap mayhem, I tell you! Often, this type of chaotic, door-slamming comedy doesn't work in American films, but Wlson and Vaughn are talented enough to pull it off. And it helps that the movie is well written (by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher), with plenty of one liners and running gags.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a tad predictable (gee, do you think true love will win?), but who cares? It's loads of fun, with some fantastically hysterical scenes."

","Last summer, Wedding Crashers was toted as the return of R-Rated comedies and which basically means more swearing and nudity. But a movie can have all the F-bombs and boobies, it still needs to have a plot, good acting, and be well written for it to be entertaining. The plot itself is brilliant, built around the concept that there is no better place to hook up than at weddings. And just because you are not invited shouldn't stop you from sampling from the easy chick buffet.<br/><br/>As for the acting Vince Vaughn returns to his roots by channeling the character that made him a star, Double Down Trent from Swingers although his character her might actually be more over the top. His partner in crime is the low key Owen Wilson who unsuccessfully tries to ground Vaughn throughout the film. After years of successfully crashing weddings they decide to crash the granddaddy of all weddings, that of the daughter of Treasury Secretary played by the always get Christopher Walken. But things get off track want Wilson decides to break one of the rules of wedding crashing, Rule #22: You have a wedding and a reception to seal the deal. Period. No overtime. But Wilson, in a play to win over the Secretary's daughter, accepts an invitation on Vaughn's behalf, who hooked up with another of his daughters, to his summer house for the weekend. But I'm sure anyone would do the same thing if the girl in question happens to be the hot chick from The Notebook (not that I've seen it or anything).<br/><br/>The writing is what brings the movie down somewhat as there were a few lulls in the movie where nothing seems to be happening. Plus there is an uber-cheesy montage where Wilson, in the middle of the night, goes to the door of the girl he is pining over only to go back to his room instead of knocking only for the girl to decide to go to his room later, but decides not to knock either. And one can't help to think that most of the funniest lines were ad-libbed by Vaughn and Wilson.<br/><br/>Be sure to check out the extra on the DVD including the 24 pages of rules to crashing wedding. And make sure you check out the extremely hilarious karaoke version of 99 Red Balloons that Vaughn and Wilson do in a deleted scene. But for some reason they have bother the Uncorked and Theatrical versions of the film on the DVD.

However it can become a bit ""blah"" at points especially towards the end. <br/><br/>Generally though a good film for all.<br/><br/>The casual nudity also gets a thumbs up!"

","This moving is definitely not socially redeeming, or probably on any Academy Award lists, but I thought this movie was absolutely HILARIOUS! Saw it with a friend on my 40th birthday and it was the best birthday I've had in years. There are so many funny scenes I can't remember any one particular that's funnier than the others. I laughed through the entire movie and all the way out to my car, too... It's not for the faint of heart or sensitive people, but if you like a rip-roaring laugh-till-it-hurts movie, this is the movie for you! I thought Vince Vaughn was hysterically funny - I swear he made me laugh from beginning to end."
"mullermike","6","1","1","12 January 2006"," Not a bad flick but falsely advertised
","Must say this movie let me down. The way it was marketed, it was billed as being another Old School, another sophomoric raunchfest. It was, for about 15 minutes. <br/><br/>So I heard about a movie starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn (spoiler, Will Ferrell is in it as well). These guys have been part of some of the funnier movies of the past five years. So why would this one be any different? You have three of the fab five (Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller being the others). and more often than not, these guys hit the mark. With movies such as Bottlerocket, Starsky and Hutch, Dodgeball, Zoolander, and the aforementioned Old School, any movie that has at least two of these guys is usually a winner. They stay away from that Hollywood sentimentality and just have some good old fashioned fun. Not the case this time.<br/><br/>Here, you see two wedding crashers, crashing weddings, then they go for the ultimate crash; going after the daughter of the Treasury Secretary. (By the way, you don't see the married couple much after the wedding). Sounds like it'd be a good time. The actual wedding scene, specifically the toast by the maid of honor, was very discomforting. Were they trying to make a statement there, it seemed legless.<br/><br/>So after the marriage, the crashers are loved by the secretary's family (mainly the can't get enough lovin daughter), so off they go for a weekend getaway. The football scene, though kind of cheesy, was funny, due in large part to Zack, played by Bradley Cooper. He's great as the arrogant boyfriend of the knock em dead gorgeous Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams). And the nymph daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) was fun as well, though she looked like she should be wearing a cap and gown for her high school graduation (can't believe she's nearly 30).<br/><br/>But this movie really became mopey after a while. The whole time Owen Wilsons character grew more and more irritating. ""Oh, I've known this girl for three days and now I'm in love with her."" Please, you're a gigolo, go get girls. I wanted to see the party antics of a wedding crasher, I didn't care to witness him finding out that he's errored in his past ways. But that's what I got.<br/><br/>Might I add that Jane Seymour has aged like fine wine. Her character is rather naughty throughout and to see her look that way in her mid 50s, wow, she's been counting her carbs since being a Bond girl. Sadly, Christopher Walken is a non factor in this movie. He's actually a very good comedic actor when he's not acting like Beelzebub. His lines were limited and he lacked the presence that he normally has. And frankly, playing a major US secretary, you'd think the guy would stand out a little bit more. Somehow he gets upstaged by two party crashers, no wait, make that one, one of them became a total sap.<br/><br/>The movie certainly started with potential. The beginning party scenes were a good time but they jumped back and forth so much that you missed the fun and they were over entirely too quickly. So yes, I must say it again, I was a bit let down by this movie. Even the ending credits had loud party music that would have been fitting for a party movie. And Vince Vaughn didn't seem as Vaughnesque this time. He was pretty funny but his acting got really campy at times (especially during the ""bedroom"" scene). He usually plays a wisecracker, and he had his moments, but I wouldn't classify this role as vintage.<br/><br/>This movie could be a breakout role for Rachel McAdams. I don't know how good of a comedic actress she actually is, you don't see that from her in this flick, but she has a face and presence that lights up the screen. I'm sure she'll be relegated to romantic comedies (which this film essentially became) but nevertheless, she has a bright future ahead. Will Ferrell added some spark to the movie but his character seemed like a self-parody. He's a guy that's at the top of his game but he's running the risk of becoming clichéd. True, it's made him a rich man, but I do see signs of his gimmick growing tiresome.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER<br/><br/>I think my biggest problem with this flick is that it has an identity crisis. At times, like the first 15 minutes, it's a party movie. The guys are drinking, dancing, sleeping around, and throughout the movie, you see the party side come up. But somewhere during this project, a Hollywood exec got the idea that one of the crashers had to see his errors and meet a woman that would change him. And please, would any decent girl want a guy after finding out he's a fraud? (Well, maybe they would). The meltdown of Wilson's character before that was somewhat believable, it's easy to go insane over a girl, but I found it kind of disturbing. The final scene summed up the movie; awkward, confused, and in the end, unsatisfying.<br/><br/>So I don't think the movie knew its audience. It was marketed as a party movie but grew into a frustrated love story that couples could enjoy. I don't mind love stories but that certainly wasn't what I expected watching this flick. There was a fair amount of T&A mixed in and since this is the 21st century, some homosexuality had to be mixed in (that scene was pretty funny, though it didn't completely hit the mark). I hope the next time Vaughn and Wilson collaborate, they remember their audience. Some of the movies I mentioned at the start were funny because they didn't get sidetracked by a hokey love story. They were films that were meant to entertain. This movie could have been that, should have been that, but in the end, it wasn't."
"ihann","7","1","1","27 December 2005"," Very funny
","Yes... it was a very funny movie. At times I could forget problems and just laugh. Owen Wilson was great and Vaughn found his target. I hated him for a lot of years after his sacrilegious interpretation of Norman Bates, but now I can understand. He was born for comedies. He is one of that comedians like Buster... they make you laugh but looks always angry. I'm not going to stop in details like script mistakes. Perhaps my congratulations to the edition work... but I think that this movie wasn't made to analyze, it was made just to enjoy and everybody in the cinema did it. I didn't see anybody after the movie without a smile and that is enough to say that is a good work.... sorry director... congratulations too."

I also love the way this movie depicts all the different types of wedding ceremonies that each culture and nationality celebrate.<br/><br/>And even though I really hope that no men of that age,(they seem to be in their late 30's, it wouldn't have been as pathetic if they were college students) are actually crashing weddings to sleep with women...I still enjoyed the movie."
"russem31","8","1","1","2 December 2005"," Laugh out funny!
","This film is one of those comedies where it only works because of the character interaction of the main characters - in this case, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn (with my hat tipped more to Vince Vaughn for his excellent performance). The story itself is quite ordinary but the dialogue (whether the above mentioned actors ad libbed or used the dialogue as written on the script page) was very funny and really worked in the mouths of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Vaughn. What happens to Vince Vaughn though is stuff movies are made of - he gets the brunt of the slapstick humor (i.e. getting chased by a neurotic 20 year old girl and a gay teenager). A laugh out riot of a movie, a must see!"
"The_Void","7","1","1","24 November 2005"," Lightweight entertainment, good for a laugh
","Wedding Crashers was touted to be one of the surprise hits of the year - and while it is good and definitely has its moments; there's just too much wrong with it to be a complete success. The first, and biggest problem is that it's just too long; while the plot is at it's best, you just want the film to continue; but after the pivotal middle section has expired, the film doesn't leave much to keep the audience interested. To be honest, I was bored with the last twenty minutes. The plot focuses on a really good idea - namely, turning up to weddings, pretending to be some distant relation, and then using this position to meet women who are basking in the glow of 'true love'. I'd engage in this activity myself if English weddings weren't so rubbish. Anyway, the plot follows two divorce mediators that make a habit of crashing weddings. Wedding season is nearing it's close, but there's still one big one left; namely, the wedding of the Treasury Secretary's daughter. After successfully infiltrating the event; one of the team finds himself at odds when he falls in love with the bride's sister...<br/><br/>A lot of the movie relies on the two leads. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn team up for this movie, and they do a very good job of keeping the audience's interest. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of either of these two (or the rest of the 'Frat-pack', Jack Black aside) but they know how to make a movie like this work, and providing they keep delivering lightweight comedies; I'm sure they'll continue to please those who do like them. Christopher Walken appears in a support role, which is always nice to see; even if he does just rely on his persona these days, and Rachel McAdams (Red Eye, Mean Girls) takes the lead female role. The jokes, as you might expect, come thick and fast; with about half of them being funny, and a select few being very funny. Most of the comedy straddles that awkward line where characters find themselves in a situation they don't like; so if you like that humour, you'll probably like this. I cant say if this is better than other recent 'Frat-Pack' films like Dodgeball and Starsky and Hutch, having not seen them - but I will say that if all you want is an easy couple of hours of entertainment, this should suffice...despite being a bit too long."
"Davve_88","8","1","1","22 November 2005"," The ultimate laugh-party!
","When I first watched this movie I was stunned, completely chocked. I never thought it could had a tempo with quick lines and a great story like this. Starsky and Hutch were like bread and butter with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Starsky and Hutch was a great and fun tribute to the real 70-s.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson makes a even better radar-couple than Wilson and Stiller. For me I guess it was even more fun than Dumb & Dumberer, it was quicker and more modern jokes. The jokes were as fun as they could get without getting childish. It's hilarious! Watch it, like it, then watch it again, and like it even more!"
"Oyster-6","8","1","1","17 November 2005"," Absolutely predictable.....great!!
","If you've seen the trailers, you'll probably have a good idea of what the Wedding Crashers is all about: 2 goof-balls having a good time during the wedding-season by chasing all women (except the bride) at all sorts of weddings. It starts of with a roller-coaster overview of all weeding-parties they go to which gives you a pretty good idea about their somewhat superficial but fun lifestyle.<br/><br/>And then Cupido hits bulls-eye with his arrow and the 'Wedding Crashers' turns into a more serious, slow-paced film, sometimes resembling ""Meet the parents"" because of all the ""how to behave when entering a odd-functioning family for the first time you don't want to/can't walk away from"". Still hilarious at times but ther's some dark humor interwoven as well The end is predictable (judge for yourself) but you wouldn't have expected differently with this kind of movie.<br/><br/>A solid 8!"
"ijtfalcon","9","1","1","13 November 2005"," Funniest thing I've seen in a long while
","Sometimes it's nice to see a good little art film that offers up a movie so unique, so true, that you wonder if cinema even existed before its conception. Other times, however, it's nice just to laugh your butt off and that's exactly what ""Wedding Crashers"" dishes up. Now I'm not saying that ""Wedding Crashers"" isn't unique, because, in reality, it is. It's unique in the fact that I can't remember a movie that made me laugh so long and so hard. In that regard, I think ""Wedding Crashers"" is actually one of the best films of the year because I truly feel it was one of the most entertaining. It's too bad that there aren't more films out there like this; that more films can't make me laugh until I cry, even on the second viewing. If you haven't yet seen this movie, then give it a chance and hopefully you'll laugh as much as I did because you probably deserve it. If not, and you think this film is terrible, then please don't hate me. I'm only trying to spread the joy."

"kevinsudefrance2","8","1","1","9 October 2005"," Not every film has to be perfect to be enjoyed!
","Sure: It wasn't the best film ever made. Sure: It had another bog-standard Hollywood ending. Sure: The script was occasionally clunky, implausible, and long-winded towards the end. So what! It was actually funny. Not all the time, not every scene, but systematically, frequently, funny. I don't ask for more than that, no one told me to go expecting Kubrick's lost masterpiece. I just wanted to laugh, and I did. Thank you.<br/><br/>In fact, we did get more than that. Yes, all the major male actors (you know who you are) made me laugh. Even Mr Walken. But to the point, this is the first time I have seen Rachel McAdams act. As a simple complicated male, her performance seems almost perfect. She is not the ugliest girl on the block, but what mattered was that when she looked into the camera, I believed every word she said. Whatever she has, she should try and share it with Andie MacDowell and Minnie Driver. A pretty face doesn't mean a believable face. Rachel McAdams seems like the real thing. I hope so. I would probably just keep raving here but let's move on...<br/><br/>To the amusement of (some of) my American friends whose reviews I have just read, let me say that there seemed to be no R rating on this film here in France. Shocking? I don't think so, come on! Interestingly, the youngest person in the cinema was about 18 years old. Let's just say two 12 year old kids came to watch the film. They would have (fleetingly, almost subliminally) seen some breasts, an amusing rope-tying incident and a good dose of swear words. Oooooooh bad! After the film, I'm not convinced they would have gone out, broken in to a shop, picked a fight with their mother, or more generally contributed to the rather over-estimated moral degeneration of society. Please! In the same optic, I was amused by the frequent review comment whining about 'bad' homophobic jokes, 'sacreligious' religious comments, and 'unfortunate' stereotyping of a couple of male 'sluts'. Comedy needs a target. It's not too complicated folks, comedy needs a target. And if your type of person, believer, or 'player' is the target, just smile. Or laugh! Let's try and take one little step away from the 'victim' society tonight.<br/><br/>A good, funny film. Funny guys and a great girl. That's all. But that's enough."

","Wedding Crashers is a movie that does just that what it promises. It is a film with a lot of laughs, especially with Vince Vaughn, who is sometimes hilarious, and a bit of romance. The chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn is superb. I just have to admit I laughed almost the entire movie. Yes, the ending is romantic and sentimental, but this is perfect for a first date. I think she'll be ready to be kissed before the movie ends. Like I said before, Wedding Crashers just delivers what it promises. Just like Fever Pitch, a movie I saw just earlier. Two movies in a row that do so well what the genre asks, what a lucky bastard am I. Wedding Crashers has not disappointed me, that is why this movie is worth the 8."
"valadas","7","1","1","5 October 2005"," A good laugh indeed
","I was always amazed by the wedding crash sport. I never could understand why wedding crashers are so seldom caught. I think that's maybe because they always chose crowded wedding parties where the bride's guests and family think they are groom's guests or relatives and vice versa. This bright comedy movie proves it again. Two philanderers, despite the fact they are not exactly badly off in life, amuse themselves crashing wedding parties galore to eat and drink freely and above all pick up ladies and girls to take to bed at first opportunity. However one day things turn out badly since not only they are caught red-handed but one of them falls in love with the bride's sister who is engaged to another guy also present in the party and after they manage to be invited for a stay in the father of the bride's house at the seaside under false identities. This is a simple story but it develops itself in a series of funny moments with some hilarious gags which will make you laugh a lot. I only didn't like very much the choice of Vince Vaughn for the role of Jeremy Grey one of the womanizer guys. He is a bit too common for a seducer at high society level but anyway he tries do his his best at it. But the most important thing is that this movie is apt to raise a good laugh indeed."

One minor complaint would be that the movie has a slow last third. The movie could have been shorter. They would have done better with more editing. Walken was his stereotypical self. Enter Chazz Reinhold, and the movie lifts another notch again. I left the theater laughing over an over at Chazz's quotes....he is sensational.

","I really enjoyed this movie. It was very funny, and well directed. The plot was basically mediocre fare, but the acting raised it to another level. I suspect that Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson improvised a lot of their dialog, which made it pretty original and truly hilarious. That just shows you that good acting can take a mildly funny Saturday-Night-Live-type plot, and turn it into a very entertaining movie. I would almost go and see any Vaughn/Wilson pairing after this. The directing and editing also enriched the film, for example, the opening montage of all the different weddings they crash was filled with a genuine insouciance that made you feel like going to a wedding. In fact, I have always thought of weddings as pretty boring, but they gave me a new opinion! It was exciting to watching them have all the fun they were having. The romance aspect between Wilson and the girl was the most boring partcan't anyone write a FUNNY young female ingénue?! It's not the fault of the actress, it's the writing. Blah. ""I'm pretty, sweet, young, and confused."" Blah, blah, blah. That's what I mean about the mediocre plot. But the chemistry and dialog of Vaughn and Wilson really make up for that!"

It was very funny and Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an hilarious on-screen duo. I really liked Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) as well. But, beside all these positive things, I think the movie might be a bit ""overhyped"" as well. It's good and funny, but it isn't extraordinary hilarious. I've seen other comedies, as good as this one, getting a much lower rating. But of course, that's only my humble opinion.<br/><br/>I can't think of any reason not to see this movie. It's a fine comedy. Christopher Walker was great as well. I also thought the few scenes of the grandmother were hilarious, as well as the weird brother of the girls. The story was fine as well.

"CSM126-1","5","1","1","17 August 2005"," Hide the Bridemaids
","""Wedding Crashers"" is an oddity. It's a film I appreciate, but not one I particularly like. It has all the makings of a great comedy: witty dialogue, raunchy humor and Owen Wilson, a genius actor. All these pieces mesh perfectly, and yet I just was not thrilled. By the end I had the odd feeling that my soul was completely drained, and I lurched to my car like a zombie.<br/><br/>The film makes good points about the nature of relationships and expertly satirizes guys like it's titular characters, men who go to weddings uninvited to score chicks. There was even a wonderful scene early on featuring costar Vince Vaughn delivering a rapid-fire speech about the ""does she or doesn't she like me"" nature of first dates that deserves applause as a short masterpiece.<br/><br/>The real failing, I think, is having Owen Wilson's character, John, fall in love. The first portion of the film, showing John and buddy Jeremy actually crashing weddings is hilarious and quick paced. Then John meets Claire Cleary, falls in love, and goes on the worn-out mission of one-upping her secretly evil boyfriend, Sack. The laughs quickly fade in favor of straight-up romance, returning only occasionally to liven things up. Jeremy's story line of being raped by his obsessive wedding date and, later, her gay brother is good stupid fun in the style of ""There's Something About Mary"" and other films of its ilk. The main story, which amounts to John making moon-eyes at Claire and Claire returning the sentiment as Sack schemes, would be an average romantic movie on it's own, but it drags down what was a great comedy.<br/><br/>The acting is hit-or-miss. Vince Vaughn is superb as the beleaguered Jeremy. His physical comedy is tempered with his verbal wit to perfectly balance the two. Isla Fisher is also great as Jeremy's obsessed wedding crashing victim Gloria, who goes all out to get her man even though he's decidedly done with her.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson, one of my favorite actors, is listless and dim as John. Romance is not Owen's thing at all, and it kills me to say he was horribly bad. But that's what it is. Rachael McAdams and Bradley Cooper are stereotypical and mundane as Claire and Sack. They phoned in their performances and, man oh man, it shows and it hurts.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken, who is normally hilarious, is forced to check his comedic persona at the door to play the straight-laced Commerce Secretary Cleary. Walken could have saved this film if he'd been allowed to show his zany side.<br/><br/>I really do appreciate every aspect of the film. It has great comedy, fair enough romance, and some brilliant acting to cover for all the bad stuff. I just can't bring myself to give it a fresh rating. Maybe romance and comedy just don't belong together (that would explain ""Just Married"" and every Julia Roberts film aside from ""Sleeping with the Enemy""). I thought 'this is pretty good', but I didn't feel it.<br/><br/>""Wedding Crashers"" is what you'd call an 'aborted masterpiece'. It starts strong, and then shoots itself dead half-way through. The second half of this film reminds me of a line from Errol Morris' ""Gates of Heaven"": ""There's your dog. Your dog's dead. But where's the thing that made it move? It had to be something...didn't it?"" This dog died too soon, and I'm not sure what happened to the thing that made it move in the first place. It's a captivating mystery."

"Quinoa1984","6","4","9","28 July 2005"," satisfactory romantic comedy, brings its laughs, and its predictability in tow
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, the stars bringing this vehicle to theaters (there are other notables in the case, but not with the kind of draw of these two), are very talented, and usually pretty amusing. Wilson, for my money, is the subtler of the two, and is more of the leading man, while Vaughn is usually over-the-top in his double-talk, and garners some laughs even when some fall flat. They take the film Wedding Crashers and make it watchable, along with some supporting actors playing strange characters. It's not as wild as one might expect from the trailers, and as a 'date' movie it's rather predictable.<br/><br/>The opening twenty minutes is close to genius, by introducing the audience into this care-free, inspired montage of Wilson and Vaughn crashing the weddings, enjoying the celebrations, and going to bed with many women. It's not laugh out loud funny, but it garners a few small laughs, and it a very good set-up for what seems to be a film in this vein. It's not quite the case- we get a story that sort of goes on auto-pilot (to put it another way, I've seen a story like this many times over in mainstream romantic comedies) wherein Vaughn gets dragged into staying for a day with the daughter (Isla Fisher, perhaps the best overall funny performance) of the Secretary of Treasury (Christopher Walken, of all people), and Wilson goes along as he tries to woo another daughter (Rachel McAdams, a beauty no doubt) who is already in a relationship with a alpha-male guy (Bradley Cooper). This is when formula takes over.<br/><br/>While the laughs are there, including a crazy dinner scene (it's like a 30's screwball comedy crossed with American Pie for this scene, one of the funniest), a demented quasi-rape of Vaughn on his first night at the Clearys, and some other amusing parts sprinkled throughout the film, there are flaws. For one, it does go a little longer than it should- a couple of scenes could've been cut, or at least trimmed. At two hours, a romp of a romantic comedy shouldn't feel this over-long (a lot of it for the story of Wilson and McAdams' characters, who have good chemistry, but don't have much room to go in the formula). Another problem is under-developed, or non-developed characters.<br/><br/>Take the character Cooper plays, Sack- he's been with Claire (McAdams) for over three years, and yet she is everything that he isn't. He's a one-dimensional villain, someone who is so obvious that it doesn't leave much room for conflict or second guessing about where the film will go. This goes for the Walken character as well, who seems mis-cast in a film where his odd comic genius and timing could come in well, but he doesn't bring much to the table aside from maybe one laugh (perhaps not intentional). Ironically, two characters who score a lot of points when they appear on screen, Will Ferrel as the Wedding Crasher legend Chaz, and Keir O'Donnell as the closet-freak/brother Todd, get very little time to bring funnier bits (they're stuck, again, in the traction of the screenplay, who do what they can in the time given).<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers did give a couple of surprises, and it is gleeful, dumb fun for most of the way. But when it comes to the last quarter it starts to drag, the laughs become more diminished, and it becomes more of waiting for the last scene than being entertained. The whole aspect of the lying theme of the film fits in, yet really as story devices. In short, it's a film that brings in its moments well, and gives some good room for Wilson and Vaughn to work in (Vaughn, whom I've always gotten the least of laughs in the pack of Wilsons, Ferrell, and Stiller in their films, actually makes good on a lot of the set-ups and pay-offs of the absurdities). But the script and actors tend to stumble as much as they make it entertaining. 6/10 or a B-"

I didn't think anyone could hang with Vince Vaughn doing his thing as well as Jon Favreau did in Swingers but Owen Wilson does it here with flying colors. Their interaction and playing off of each other is hilarious from the very beginning of the movie. That opening scene is classic by the way- Rebecca DeMornay ""You shut your mouth when you're talking to me!""- laughing my ass off. Anyway, it's quick at times and sort of clever when Vince and Owen are conversating and it's just what they're talking about with straight faces that makes it so good.

","This movie is not deep. The plot is not clever. I actually thought the previews looked stupid. But it's so good. The whole move is completely implausible and couldn't happen under any circumstances. Crashing a wedding where the security is provided by the secret service and not only were they not shot, but got invited over to the summer house for the weekend?! Impossible. BUT, I didn't even notice that stuff until I had seen the movie 4 or 5 times. It's so funny you don't care. The football scene was particularly funny. It reminded me of a short film called Fourth and Long. Best football comedy ever. Saw it on MySpace or Youtube. Anyway, do yourself a favor and check it out. If you like R rated comedy you won't be disappointed."
"MovieAddict2016","5","3","6","2 September 2005"," I was very disappointed.
","So these two sex-crazy guys decide to crash weddings. They get laid a lot, really easily, and keep doing it. (Pun intended.) So eventually one of them actually falls in love with a girl, and meanwhile a nutcase harasses his best buddy. Cue some crude sex gags, a couple of cameos and all the other obvious stuff. The result? Wedding Crashers, a disappointingly average comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn.<br/><br/>The movie's plot isn't strong to begin with, but it is taken to an insultingly simplistic level in less than thirty minutes. Once the beginning wears off, the movie gets stuck in a rut  it turns into a film less about crashing weddings, and more about trying to survive in a wacko's house for a few days without being sexually molested. (Nope, it's not a Michael Jackson biography.) Example? In one scene, a woman molests Vaughn's character, then  while still strapped to a bed, unable to free himself  another character who's supposed to be gay begins to kiss him and proceeds to try and seduce him.<br/><br/>It's funny at first, but the whole gag is stretched far too long  once we understand that the girl is a psycho and the kid is gay, it's only funny for so long.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Christopher Walken (who plays a wealthy politician) is pushed to the background, his character unconvincing, unfunny and unreasonable. Although the role is similar to that of De Niro's in ""Meet the Parents,"" it's so underwritten and neglected that Walken really just comes across as another vacant face.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Wilson have good chemistry (which we already knew, really) and they alone make Wedding Crashers suitable entertainment. As a way of passing ninety lazy minutes, it's adequate fluff. But it could have been better  a lot better. The humor could have been funnier, raunchier, and more daring. The plot could have used less clichés and more spice. Walken and many other characters could have been filled out to their full comedic potential.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is disappointing because it achieves so little. It's one of those films where you're already forgetting it on the way out of the theater. I was hoping I'd at least remember it back to the hotel room."
"diand_","3","3","6","19 August 2005"," Childish. Juvenile. Pathetic. (not my words)
","The storytelling killed this one for me. Yes, we know they are divorce mediators after several minutes of mundane dialog hammering that out. We know they crash weddings after letting us visit too many of them. And the way the senator's family part, taking up the largest part of the story, ends is predictable to the extreme. For a comedy clocking in at almost 2 hours there's not enough arc in the story, so we have to rely on the script at a basic level, which contains some funny lines, but more not-so-funny ones. We then still have the comedy skills of Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and later Will Ferrell to make this work, but they have the comedy talents of an average stand-up comedian, not able to make a feature-length movie very interesting. There were almost no laughs in the audience, the only character and actress that fitted the screwball here was Gloria (Isla Fisher), in an amusing over-the-top performance.<br/><br/>As marriage is presented here as a lie, they crash weddings to profit from that lie (after all they are divorce mediators being confronted by that lie everyday). As death is not a lie, John suddenly sees the light here. It is therefore a rather strange turn to let this end in two marriages, and then crash weddings again, although it is in the romcom-handbook. But that is the level of stupidity in the script that made this such an uninteresting comedy."

","This movie was just awesome. I want to see it again and again. Maybe its because Owen Wilson is so gorgeous... or maybe because it was just that funny. This movie truly made me laugh, and i found the plot and the outcome to be witty and entertaining. <br/><br/>Vince Vaughn was great, he has got to be one of the funniest men alive, and I'm glad he was in the spotlight of this film. Owen Wilson, perhaps I'm biased because I think he's a stud, but I think he was also awesome in this movie. Him and Vince had an undeniable chemistry. I seen some of their bloopers and stuff and the majority of the comedy in this film was just Vince and Owen joking around. The scripts were just guidelines, a lot of the funny one liners were made up as they went. Then there's Will Ferrel. His cameo was just hilarious.<br/><br/>As I said, the plot was very entertaining. It is outrageously cheesy and unlikely yes, but yet, it is just so side-splittingly comical, you find yourself enjoying it. It has a number of twists and turns and you're left wondering what could possibly happen next. <br/><br/>The movie has it all, romance for the ladies, nudity and raunchy jokes for the men. You could see it on a date, or just a night out with your friends. I don't know if I'd recommend going with your family though. All in all, I say the is a premium comedy that all should see. It is definitely worth the price of admission."

","""Wedding Crashers"" has engaged many movie lovers throughout the nation. It's a box office hit that ceremoniously has made a comedic impact in a very ""marry marry"" way. Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson star as Jeremy Klein & John Beckwith, two hardcore wedding crashers who strategically plan out their pseudo-guest conquests with artistry and appeal. What are the rewards? Complementary culinary arts tasting, complementary liquor arts tasting, and complimentary vagina arts tasting! I am going to kill my high school career counselor! Why didn't he invite wedding crashologists to the school's annual career day event? Anyway, Jeremy & John eventually do fall in love and not in lust with female wedding guests. John succumbs to Claire Cleary, the candy-coated politician daughter played by the uprising starlet Rachel Mcadams. Jeremy falls for Claire's sister Gloria; her magnetically robust demeanor was quite memorable. Isla Fisher's jocular performance as Gloria makes her the ""scene-stealing maid of comedic honor"" of ""Wedding Crashers"". Our ""Wedding Crasher"" stars were also not too shabby. Vince Vaughn's prototype garrulous, but never exhausting, acting was quite stupendous. You also got to owe it to Owen for his perspicacious solid work. This dynamic comedic acting duo should not be annulled. They have the chemistry potentiality to be the ""Martin & Lewis"" of our generation. The rest of the cast of ""Wedding Crashers"" was also worth inviting. Christopher Walken once again was ""walkin"" to the part of a controlling, but yet, caring father with exact precision. Jane Seymour was ""m.i.l.f.ing"" it through as the hot mother who craves for John. We also get to ""see more"" of Seymour in ""Wedding Crashers"". That in itself is worth crashing this movie! Also, there is a high profile comedic actor who makes an appearance during the final segments of the film. I ""Will"" not say too much, but let me just state that he proves once more that he has the ""Will to Power"" in comedies. I do ""vow"" my head to Director David Dobkin for elucidating our humdrum summer movie season with ""Wedding Crashers"". Make sure your next movie ""reception"" is ""Wedding Crashers"". ***** Excellent"
"colonel_green","8","3","6","26 July 2005"," Worth seeing just for the lovely Rachel McAdams.
","Cahadian actress Rachel McAdams (""Mean Girls"") is both beautiful and talented, and her star appears to be in ascendancy. That's a good thing for everyone. She is a wonderful screen presence, and ""Wedding Crashers"" is worth seeing solely because of her.<br/><br/>This is clearly a ""Frat Pack"" movie, with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in the lead roles, and Will Ferrell making a cameo appearance. I kind of wish that Owen's brother Luke had shown up, but that's neither here nor there. Owen and Vince are thirtysomethings who crash weddings in order to seduce bridesmaids. They decide to crash the wedding of the eldest daughter of William Cleary (Christopher Walken), a powerful politician. In doing so, Owen falls for Claire (McAdams) and Vince is snared by Gloria (Isla Fisher), a borderline-psychotic nymphomaniac. Vince wants to run, but Owen is now in love with Claire, and wants to convince her to leave her lout of a boyfriend, Sack (Bradley Cooper, intense and losable). Various hilarious and embarrassing antics ensue.<br/><br/>Unusually for movies of this genre, both Claire and Gloria feel like real characters. Owen is sometimes a bit boring, while Vince is playing his standard character, and doing it well. Will Ferrell's cameo is as the original Wedding Crasher, who has now gone on to crashing funerals. It's all good.<br/><br/>I give ""Wedding Crashers"" an 8/10."

It gets better when Rachel McAdam's character enters the movie. Good performances by Owen Wilson , Rachel McAdams and Jane Seymour. I liked the creepy gay artist brother.<br/><br/>This movie has some mild message about love being more important than one-night stands, but that message is not really well delivered, and I think more guys will come away from this with clever ideas for crashing weddings than will decide to build an enduring relationship."
"CIMC","5","3","6","16 July 2005"," I like thinking about what this film could have been
","So this guy is a regular presence at weddings. He's entertains the guests and is well- received by everybody. He falls for a girl. The girl is with this other guy that has a lot going for him but just might be a total jackass. Now this guy has to attempt to woo an engaged girl in order for the film to have a happy ending. Sound familiar? Well the lead story line isn't the only thing that Wedding Crashers shares with 1998's The Wedding Singer. The best friend of the lead male has a potential love interest in the lead female's sister. Wedding Crashers even lifts Ellen Albertini Dow as a feisty old lady that likes to say things that old lady's just don't say. In many important ways Wedding Crashers is The Wedding Singer with Owen Wilson standing in for Adam Sandler and Vince Vaughn playing an enlarged version of Allen Covert's role. In perhaps the most unfortunate shared trait, it slaps a lazy script on a can't- miss comedy idea.<br/><br/>The film opens promisingly with John Beckwith and Jeremy Klein (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) hyped about the start of ""wedding season"", a time of year when they can hit weddings and find food, drinks and sex o'plenty from women in an emotionally- compromised state. Taking on guises to match the culture or ethnicity of the weddings they crash they eat, drink and screw their way through a series of receptions leading up to the wedding for a daughter of the Secretary of Treasury (Christopher Walken) and there the plot thickens...way too much. Dropping moments of brilliant hilarity over by-the-numbers romantic comedy schmaltz, Wilson falls hard for one of Secretary Clearly's other daughters Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams). There's probably a lot of fun to be had in letting Wilson try to salvage a romance when his love interest knows his job, name, and life history, just not the real ones. However director David Dobkin (Shanghai Knights) carefully steers clear of most humorous areas to take the road well-traveled. There's even a montage of broken- hearted would-be lovers over a sad guitar song, ouch. Alas comes the inevitable confrontation at the altar where the script actually acknowledges the cliché out loud but refuses to seek shelter in self-parody.<br/><br/>Despite the crappy writing, just barely competent direction and being a good 25 minutes too long at 119 min., Wedding Crashers still generates enough goodwill to just about be worth seeing at a matinée price. The team of Christopher Walken, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are capable of mining humor out of the most dreadful material and they intermittently succeed at making the movie laugh-out-loud funny. There are great scenes between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson that seem like they came from a different, much better film. McAdams and Wilson have chemistry enough to make the attraction easy to swallow and a memorable late-film cameo by Will Ferrell brings a burst of much-needed hilarity to one of the most painfully syrupy parts of the film.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is a film that in a way makes me think about last year's Manchurian Candidate. Though the original was a classic piece of fantastic paranoia, someone felt compelled to remake it anyway. Though the remake does justice to the original, it begs the question, why remake a great film? Why not remake a film that could have been great but wasn't? Here's hoping someone does that for Wedding Crashers in the future."

","So far it has been a very productive and enjoyable year in the movie world and with the big comedy movie of the summer having arrived, yet again audiences won't be disappointed. This is a comedy dream team-up here with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The two have been regulars in the Ben Stiller posse and this time these two titans share the screen. Of all the team-ups you could imagine from the Wilson's, Vaughn. Stiller, Ferrell and Black, the Wedding Crashers has perhaps the most interesting and indeed the two spark off each other superbly.<br/><br/>Crashers is a very funny movie. In fact it is riotous at times. I have not laughed as hard as I did watching this at the cinema before. I was crying I tell you, crying in a theatre full of witnesses, and everyone else was crying with me, crying with uncontrollable laughter. This is a good solid R-rated movie and in good old England my home a very adult 15 certificate and it really pushes that rating very close to a full 18 certificate, and in fact I am shocked this film wasn't rated 18. This film really pushes the limits of taste, but does so superbly. This features perhaps the best dining room scene ever, the funniest rape scene ever, and the funniest motor-boat impression ever. Why is the film funny? It just is. It's down to great comical performances and outrageous situations.<br/><br/>The story revolves around two wedding crashers who crash weddings in order to get laid. They have been doing so for years, however John (Wilson) is getting tired and questioning whether or not they should be doing it at their age. Vaughn insists they should live a little while they are still young however Wilson points out that they are not that young anymore. Of course the two still crash weddings and set about hitting the mother-load at the wedding of the year. At the wedding Wilson meets and becomes infatuated with Claire (Rachel MacAdems) while Vaughn sees her younger sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher) but merely as a notch on his belt. Of course the Wilson plot-line is your typical rom-com plot-line where two people meet, begin to fall for each other, but on the pretence of a lie, which later comes out and threatens to wreck any hope of the inevitable happy ending. This is your atypical rom-com stuff but thankfully doesn't become too perfunctory, keeping the laughs on a high, even at the climax of the film, when a lot of staple rom-com scenes play out. However most of the films big laughs involve Vaughn's plot line where he gets more than he bargained for with Fisher who turns out to be a psychotic and clingy nymphomaniac.<br/><br/>The cast are great. Wilson is as laid back and easy going as ever, while MacAdems is just adorable. However Vince Vaughn is a one man show. Vaughn is absolutely top class here, on fire. Isla Fisher is just superb as the deranged sister and she and Vaughn have some of the funniest scenes I have seen in ages. There is also good support from Christopher Walken and a rather hot Jane Seymour (Milf!) as his wife, who keeps trying to seduce Wilson to hilarious effect. Elsewhere Will Ferrell turns up for a funny cameo as a guy who crashes funerals.<br/><br/>Overall this film is pure hilarity. A great comedy with great scenes. ****"

That's yawn and bathroom break time. The film has quite the formulaic ending, but other than that, the film's pretty darn good.<br/><br/>It's rated R for boobies and language. It's almost like they put those in to bring in the HS boy crowd, because they could've easily edited them out and the movie wouldn't have changed at all.

""Gloria"" steals much of the movie, but that's a very good thing because she's the reason for many of the LOL moments (plus she's curvaceously cute). So even though Rachel's and Owen's characters are supposedly the main focus of the movie, it's Isla and Vince that follow a close 2nd.<br/><br/>Instant classic? I don't think so; it's not filled with enough quotable one-liners.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell (wedding crasher master) and Christopher Walken (the father) have supporting parts<br/><br/>A definite rental, an easy matinée, an extremely good candidate for full price, and I wouldn't say that about very many (movie) comedies that have ever been made (I really like Airplane and The Jerk, FYI)"

Whether the wedding is Catholic, open-air, Jewish, Hindu or even the coup-de-grace, the wedding of one of the daughters of the Secretary of the Treasury (brilliantly played by Christopher Walken), these two buddies have the art of crashing weddings down to a science; only thing is, it is this last wedding where they get jammed up, or rather, hoisted up by their own petard.<br/><br/>Both Wilson and Vaughn's characters endear themselves to the Treasury Secretary's family, and as a result of the friendliness that runs both ways, get themselves invited out to the family's island home on Maryland's Eastern Shore for a few days.<br/><br/>(An example of the 'friendliness': Jane Seymour  who is playing in wicked and wanton form in this film as Walken's wife in a scene with Wilson where she is clearly coming on to him says: ""The Secretary and I have been married 30 years"". Wilson makes a complimentary remark. She continues, ""We've been faithful for two."") <br/><br/>With the (psychotic) youngest daughter Gloria (played by Isla Fisher, who stole just about every scene she was in) and the deranged, sicko homosexual son 'Todd', who were BOTH white hot on the trail of Vaughn's character, and Wilson doing what he can to get past the mean-spirited control-freak 'boyfriend' of the other drop-dead gorgeous daughter (Rachel McAdams), the sparks fly all-around in one non-stop laugh after another, all coming down to a showdown in a wedding at the end involving one of the players that will leave your jaw hanging wide open. <br/><br/>The only real complaints of note I had with this movie was way too much dropping of the 'f-bombs' when there was simply no need. This movie was genuinely funny without the need to drop them, and it would have still earned its R-rating. The gratuitous showing of quick flashes of female flesh had no artistic merit to it; the simple innuendo or suggestion of taking these girls to bed would have gone much further with moviegoers, as our imaginations are far more lurid than anything they could have come with. We could also have done without the one cameo towards the end of the film, as it added nothing noteworthy towards the movie.<br/><br/>WEDDING CRASHERS is a definite MUST-SEE for serious movie-goers and the DVD will be well worth the purchase at Thanksgiving or Christmas time; HOWEVER, it is for GROWN-UPS only, and the R rating was given for good reason. DO NOT bring children to this movie under any circumstances as most of the jokes would fly over their heads. Let them wait until they are old enough to experience juvenile adulthood for themselves  that is, if they want to.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film an 'easy' 9! ***"

","I always compare Wedding Crashers to The 40 year old virgin. 40 year old virgin is really funny, but I love Wedding Crashers. I think that everything about it is hilarious. I could see men doing this sort of thing. It also launched the career of Bradley Cooper from another one of my favorite films, The Hangover. In Wedding Crashers, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play John and Jeremy, two guys who go to weddings to meet girls. Complete stranger's weddings.Just for sex. They usually come up with a passable excuse. They go to all these weddings. One day, they find the perfect wedding. The secretary of the treasury's(the awesome Christopher Walken)daughter is getting married. John and Jeremy go to this wedding. They end up meeting two women, both the secretary's daughters. One is Claire(Rachael Mcadams) and the other is the huge psycho Gloria(Isla Fisher)who is supposedly a virgin. John and Jeremy are both invited to go up to the secretary's lakehouse. John wants to to get to know Claire. It turns out that Claire is engaged to Sack or Zach(Bradley Cooper). So John flirts with his crush while Jeremy tries to avoid his. Jeremy suffers that entire weekend by getting raped, and many other things. Wedding Crashers is a genius film. It's so funny and there is so much that they did with it. Wedding Crashers is an incredibly creative comedy that deserves more credit than it received."

I thought lets laugh for about 80 minutes and lets then take on the corny sh*t. but no. I was like:what the hell?? why aren't they crashing weddings anymore? the romantic starts just in the very beginning of the movie. for a while I could live with it but later on in the movie some of the cheesy dialogs make me sick in both in stomach and head.<br/><br/>and yeah the story of course who could have predicted it??? the pretenders are getting caught, everybody is feeling miserable(romantic clishé number 1 is that first everything has to go wrong of course) the girl is intending to marry her boyfriend( who is by total coincidence a total jerk who gives nothing about here and the chick has of course first fall in love with another guy to realize that after a relationship of almost 4 years) , the friend first doesn't want anything to do with the chick who's totally over him, but guess what... yes also they fall in love en end up married. than we have the over clichéd ""I love you declaration"" in public( textbook romantic cliché number 2) and the film ends with not 1 but 2 happy couples ..<br/><br/>Like I said , I expected some romantic nonsense, but I could never expect they would use ALL the over clichéd textbook romantic crap during the whole movie in a very cheesy way!!<br/><br/>I was stunned , shocked ,awed and above all traumatically disappointed. I was out for a cheap laughter, but this story was so cheap it was an insult for my intellect. fine some jokes are OK, but the story is so bad I can't imagine you like this movie unless you're the typical ""I want a cheesy happy ending romantic movie girl""<br/><br/>If you're not, save yourself some money ,TIME and a traumatic experience to not watch this movie"

","Many people have called Wedding Crashers the funniest movie of 2005 and I agree that It is funny but I completely disagree with it being the funniest of 2005.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers starts out great, lots of laughs, completely raunchy, the works. I thought that the laughs were never going to stop coming, but they did. For me it was Owen Wilson who ruined the movie for me. When him and Rachel McAdams have too many of those cutsey cliché romantic scenes. By this time during the movie there were almost no funny scenes what so ever, although I credit Vince Vaughn for a few laughs that saved some scenes.<br/><br/>So I'll give this movie a barely passing grade of 5/10 because only about half of the movie was funny.

","I would like to say, that although this movie provided some funny moments, overall it's not the ""Comedy Classic"" most view it as.<br/><br/>Crashers is the story of two guys (played by Vaughn and Wilson) who crash weddings in order to have sex with the bridesmaids or other guests. Early in the movie Owen Wilson's character falls for a girl and decides he must have her, however she has a boyfriend.<br/><br/>The movie is basically the story of him trying to get this girl, and for the most part takes place over a weekend in her parents house. After he is rejected he becomes depressed and meets Will Ferrell's character who is a legend of Wedding Crashing. At this point Ferrell introduces Wilson to funeral crashing, and Wilson realizes this isn't what he wants, so Wilson and Vaugn reunite to crash the wedding of the girl Wilson fell in love with, and in the end he gets the girl.<br/><br/>While this movie has some hilarious moments, such as Vaughn getting a handjob at a dinner table, Will Ferrell's scene, and a crazy gay guy. The plot is too boring and formulaic, and this is probably the most cleverly disguised Romantic Comedy EVER! That said, if you are a fan of the ""Frat Pack"" you should buy it. If you're not, save your money."

They had such great chemistry that it makes it seem that they really had been best friends for years.<br/><br/>I thought the supporting actors (Christopher Walken and Will Ferrell) were just as funny as Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, and I don't think anyone could have played their characters as well.<br/><br/>It is so much more than your average comedy.

I don't know what problems these Jewish directors have and if this is intentional or what.<br/><br/>That being said, I've watched this movie a few times, as the DVD has commentary features with the director, and with the two actors, which helped me to understand the movie a bit more. I thought it a bit on the boring side, it's long, drawn out, and not at the very least funny.<br/><br/>It has some eye-candy and flesh scenes in it, in the beginning, and attractive actresses if you dig it, but, it was not that much of a funny film.<br/><br/>However, the premise, of Crashing Weddings, or Funerals to pick up girls, is what compelled me to rent the movie, and to give it a serious look. The idea of crashing weddings is also seen on 'askmen' website, where it goes into further dealing. Conceptually, it's brilliant, but it still seemed too phoney.<br/><br/>The director claims to have gone at lenghts to make this movie believable and not lose the audience, and I think it's sort of strained by using high-profile actors. However, on the other hand, the improvisions, and contributions to the actors to the movie, were superb, but come on - if famous Hollywood actors crashed a normal wedding - is that going to be believable? Honestly, Hollywood Actor such as Owen and Vince will have no problems picking up girls at weddings, funerals, or on a street corner, I wish I had their problem. Looking at them just makes me feel worst about my own luck picking up girls."

Call me old-fashioned, prudish, whatever, but I get really tired this theme: A man's worth and manhood is directly measured between his legs and by his sexual conquests. I also get tired of women being portrayed as having no brains at all and their worth directly measured by their physical beauty. This movie would have you believe that two professional men have no other way to socialize with women and enough spare time to research and crash weddings. They would also have you believe that there are lots of weddings with beautiful young women who have such little intelligence as to mistake the guys stupidity for charm and hop in the sack with him. Give me a break! I know it's just a movie, but for something to be funny, it has to have an element of truth or believability.

","The storyline of ""Wedding Crashers"" involves to men invading weddings to meet girls. Eventually, they are invited to stay at a family's house, where both of them try to get their dream girls. It fails for a couple of reasons. Let me explain.<br/><br/>First of all, it stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I don't disrespect these actors, but they have starred in many stupid/silly comedies that haven't succeeded too much. I liked ""Dodgeball"" but disliked ""Anchorman"" and it almost seems like that their next movie is going to be a failure because of what their past looks like. I'm not saying it's bad that they are put in comedies, but it seems kind of clichéd, like putting Clint Eastwood in Westerns. The only real difference is that many actors famous for comedies (such as Adam Sandler) have had a history of bad movies, (Such as ""Billy Madison"") while most of Clint Eastwood's Westerns have succeeded. (Such as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."") If you've seen Vince and Owens's past movies, you may not have high expectations for this one. (I hated ""The Big Bounce."") <br/><br/>Second of all, the film tries to be a sex comedy, and it fails at that. I saw the unrated version, which meant more vulgarity and more non amusing jokes. For example, take the mom (an old lady) who wants Owen to feel her chest.<br/><br/>Is that a bad joke? Yes it is.<br/><br/>There are a few good laughs, but they are too simple or cliché to work. They often include simple jokes such as repeating the same word over and over. The rest of the movie is just pure boredom.<br/><br/>Owen and Vince are both well-loved comedians, but it seems like they don't contribute too much to their parts. ""School of Rock"" succeeded as a comedy mostly because of Jack Black. But, it seemed like ""Wedding Crashers"" would have done just as well with average actors in their places.<br/><br/>""Wedding Crashers"" was obviously made because the writers could include women getting topless in many scenes. The two writers of this film (Steve Faber and Bob Fisher) have little experience with movies and don't do comedy so well.<br/><br/>There is little to get excited about, because ""Wedding Crashers"" is yet another one of the many comedy disasters out there.<br/><br/>3/10 <br/><br/>Good: A few funny jokes, some people may like the exposure of women in the unrated version.<br/><br/>Bad: Clichés, boredom, bad jokes and predictable. The exposition may be a problem to some.<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

","Another film where I wish I could give 0 as a score. I'm not really sure exactly what kind of audience this film is aimed at.<br/><br/>It's clearly not aimed at men. If it were, Vaughn would not have been such a pussy to allow himself to get trapped by the mad bunny boiler played by Isla Fisher and end up getting married. Likewise Wilson would not have fallen in love.<br/><br/>It's clearly not aimed at women, the films demeans them and makes them looks like sex objects and sluts who sleep with men at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>It's clearly not a date movie. If a guy were to take a women to this for a date she'll know exactly what he expects after the film, sex. And having seen the film most women won't be in the mood at all, despite the really weak ""Feel Good"" ending.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be about 2 men who gate crash weddings and then receptions to meet women and have sex with them, and then leave before they wake up. They have a clear set of rules and invent rules when they feel like it. I'm quite amazed that there are no rules regarding what to do if your fellow crasher starts ignoring the rules.<br/><br/>Try Rule 1:- Every man for himself.<br/><br/>The film shows Vaughn and Wilson (by the way, can't he afford plastic surgery on his nose? It looks bloody awful!) attending several weddings then going to the receptions. Are they never asked for invitations at the receptions? Every wedding I've ever been to, the reception was invite only and there's always someone checking invites on the door. Normally 2 people so between the 2 of them they know everyone coming through the door.<br/><br/>Any crashers then get the cold shoulder and shown the door, or never make it inside. I don't know why they even bother going to the actual wedding and just go to the reception. It's rare a reception happens RIGHT after the actual wedding. Most have a private invite/close family/friends only dinner and then an evening do which is also invite only.<br/><br/>One of the rules is about getting in at all costs and another states why bother with invites. In that case why aren't there any scenes where Wilson & Vaughn have to bluff their way into the parties? Or any scenes of them failing to get in at all.<br/><br/>The only party either one gets kicked out of is the most obvious, the engagement of Wilson's love interest. Not a wedding, an engagement. Aren't they screwing with their own rules here? Pointless.<br/><br/>Going to a family house after a wedding as well. Way, way off the rules in my opinion. Right there Vaughn should have left Wilson to try whatever he wanted - he was already in danger from a female and should be allowed to think of himself 1st.<br/><br/>This film looks nice. It's way, way too long. By about an hour. It's boring, the plot circles round aimlessly looking for places to go and never really manages to get any where.<br/><br/>The outcome at the end is against all rules of wedding crashing. The appearance of Will Ferrall is not needed. The ideal ending would be Wilson crashing Vaughns wedding and rescuing him and taking him to a different wedding to crash or them going to the new thing to crash - A funeral.<br/><br/>Avoid this like the plague."

So she was willing to watch it again and we rented it. Well, it just so happened that my sister and her husband were getting ready to rent the very same title, so we decided to go to their place and watch it together, along with my 16-year-old nephew.<br/><br/>Well, we all hated this movie - including my wife this time, and she couldn't understand how she'd previously found it so amusing. There are practically no laughs here, and it's a one-joke film that shoots its load early on. Yes, we get that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn find their kicks by crashing people's weddings and it's a chuckle for the first couple of minutes of montages... so now what? Well, we then introduce more unlikable people (another insufferable appearance from Christopher Walken, blah) and toss in an excruciating love story to involve the one Wedding Crasher with the busted nose falling for one of the pretty young females at one reception. I hate to sound so juvenile, but only getting to gawk at the still-lovely 50-something Jane Seymour strutting about in the nude like a slut managed to arouse my interest for a minute. The idea that she would even lower herself in such a manner is besides the point, but at least I kept my eyes open for her contribution. (I later learned she used a body double). It's a shame that the DVD became defective at this moment, the picture kept breaking up, and jumped ahead during her seductive sequence; evidently I wasn't the only renter who at least found this scene interesting. 0 out of ****"

"MacAindrais","5","2","4","12 January 2006"," Your childhood puzzle masquerading as 'Wedding Crashers.'
","Wedding Crashers: **.5* (2.5)<br/><br/>'Wedding Crashers' stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as Jeremy Gray, and John Beckwith, two middle aged single men who have made a career out of crashing weddings to pick up women. Now, here is a movie that has garnered much praise and adoration, and has been hailed as one of the most hilarious comedies in years. Naturally, after so much praise and suggestions from others to see it, I gave it a go. Perhaps The praise it received led me to expect too much, or maybe it just really wasn't very good. Afterall, I went into 'Anchorman' and 'The 40 year old Virgin' with high expectations and found myself laughing out-loud. And its not like I expected a very good movie, just a funny one. So, what happened? 'Wedding Crashers' starts off with some nice little musical montages. They were fun, but alas, not really very funny. I kept waiting and hoping for some big laughs to start during the first half hour or so, but sadly they never showed up. I began to find myself growing bored. I almost tinkered with the thought of simply walking out, but, as movies are expensive, I chose to stay and push that thought away. I thought to myself, ""boy, these things really should be making me laugh. Whats going on here?"" I grinned a few times, but no laughs. The jokes are intentionally corny, but rather than a corniness that you laugh at, the jokes don't' have that edge or subtle comedy that previous work from Vaughan and crew had. Maybe it's just that we've seen these jokes done better before, and they feel too recycled to be funny anymore. Now don't' get me wrong, I laughed a few times, and there are a number of funny parts. My problem is that there should have been many more funny parts; parts that were there in which comedy shines through, but its as if you are looking at it through glass in an aquarium: You see it, but cannot touch it.<br/><br/>As the movie progressed, I did find it funnier. The dinner scene in particular was quite funny, and a few other parts did make me laugh. The fact that Christopher Walken, who is in many respects a comedic timing master, and is hardly used is upsetting. Here is a man who, as Roger Ebert put it, could order pizza over the phone and make it a hilarious event. 'Wedding Crashers' has its moments, but ultimately falls short of its goal, whatever it was. Its clichéd heart is too clichéd to be sentimental or funny. The film ends up being that puzzle you tried to put together as a child which always had a missing piece. That missing piece keeps the picture from being whole and successful, and try as you might, you can never find where its been hidden. That childhood puzzle has been manifested as 'Wedding Crashers'- You can still see what the picture is without that piece, but its never as good as it should be with it. 5.5/10. A regrettable thumbs down."

This film is a throwback to the adult comedies of the 1970s. It wears its R rating proudly and proceeds to throw as many sex jokes at you as possible (with the expected female nudity).

Yes it's silly, VERY raunchy and predictable--but I loved it.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Wilson are just great--they play off each other well and are GREAT at comedy. McAdams is beautiful and very good. Cooper is easily one of the most hateful villains I've ever seen in a comedy. Christopher Walken walks around in a daze (as usual) but isn't bad. Even Jane Seymour pops up and it's astonishing to see her talking dirty--but very funny too.<br/><br/>Only a few minor complaints--there are plenty of dead spots in this picture--TOO many. Also it comes to a screeching halt when it gets serious. It also allows its main characters to be abused WAY too much. Vaughn and Wilson are repeatedly beaten by Cooper--I didn't find that funny--it got too violent. Wilson and Vaughn are jerks but we don't need to see them get beaten up like they do.<br/><br/>So it IS a dirty movie so it's not for everybody (keep the kids AWAY from this one) but it is funny for those who are game.

And I felt that I was close, extremely close.<br/><br/>I declare that a golden age has returned. The crown jewel of which is the movie ""Wedding Crashers."" The quotable and entertaining adult comedy has returned and it is stomping out worthless corporate TV show retread movies and CGI garbage in its wake.<br/><br/>Enjoy these times fellow movie watchers.

","I went into this movie with high hopes, from all raves I've been hearing. I have no idea how this movie earned a 7.4/10 rating on IMDb - maybe our standards for movies have sunk so low that we'll accept absolute recycled crap.<br/><br/>I think I chuckled maybe 4 or 5 times during this movie. And I wasn't alone - hardly anyone laughed at the showing we were at - with the exception of a few chuckles here and there. I expected this movie to be ""brainless"" but the plot and character situations were so absurd, the movie felt thrown together and unbelievable. I think they could have done so much more with the premise, it felt completely wasted. I would have overlooked this fact if the movie was actually funny. It was hardly worth the gift certificate I used to watch this movie."

","""Wedding Crashers"" is pretty obviously aimed at the ""Meet the Parents/Fockers"" crowd, and it certainly is just as forgettable as those two movies. It's also a lot longer, and much less pleasant - listening to other audience members laughing made me feel like Homer Simpson post-crayon-removal and watching ""Love Is Nice"" (""That's Bill PULLMAN, you fool!""); in an even closer analogy, one scene in David Dobkin's movie has wedding maid Rachel McAdams trying to keep a straight face while listening to her sister's wedding vows and almost succeeding. I had considerably less difficulty keeping a straight face throughout most of this movie's (over)length.<br/><br/>In fairness to Miss McAdams and the cast in general, it's not their fault I didn't warm to it the way a lot of others have; the performances throughout are a lot better than the material deserves, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson often just seeming to be improvising or delivering standup routines (which is strange given that they aren't comedians). The trouble is, nothing throughout the movie rings emotionally true the way it did in ""Meet the Parents"" or the sequel; the family our mediators/crashers slip into is chock full of screwball-wannabe stereotypes rather than people - mother Jane Seymour and daughter Isla Fisher score the highest in this field (watching the latter come into Vaughn's bedroom and rape him is a low point for the movie; imagine if it was the other way around... and equations to Jodie Foster in ""The Accused"" have no business being in comedies) - and because it's so phony throughout it completely fails to earn its soothing moments near the end.<br/><br/>That it's almost never funny doesn't help; it's always nice to see Rebecca DeMornay, and uncredited Will Ferrell singlehandedly raises my rating to 4 out of 10 (only when he's on screen does it qualify as a comedy), but ""Wedding Crashers"" is ultimately proof that it's not only overproduced blockbusters that can leave you empty inside. Sadly, its box office take suggests that New Line Cinema can think of plenty of reasons why we might get a sequel; if only we could have forever held our peace at the kiosk."

","I admit that Wilson and Vaughn ham & egg pretty well together, and the plot breezes along quickly. However, it cannot move fast enough to paper over the totally implausible plot failures which made watching the film a bit difficult.<br/><br/>These two scammers would never have been invited to the Secretary's shore compound. Sorry - claiming to be related to Aunt Nellie and Uncle Ed, or whatever, would never, ever get them to the villa or on the yachts. Once identified, the Secretary - and his daughters - would never have allowed them to marry these two grifters. I don't care how egalitarian we pretend to be - it would never occur. Everything about them was transparently false.<br/><br/>The nymphomanical daughter? Oh, she's a keeper! Not!!! And what about the age difference? What on earth would she see in Vaughn? Sack, or whatever Claire's boyfriend was called? A more reptilian brute you'd be hard pressed to find. A Lodge? They've been going out for 3 and 1/2 years? Never.

Will Ferrell appeared in the last third and saved the film. Will can be funny, but in a strong way like Ajax. To much much Will can kill a movie, but Will is great in a supporting role, and Will saves the Wedding crashers by himself. The last third of the movie was dying, and Will gave it fresh material. Typical low-end humor, in old school style, but not over done. Christopher Walken plays a very small role, and does not perform any humor. Walken can be very funny, like the Jayman in Envy.

","Largely entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly thoughtful- Wedding Crashers is so much more than an average buddy comedy- and somehow is able to prove itself to become one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make a fantastic pair, and the two's chemistry is quite impressive. Their performances are very comedic, but well done, and most of the actors involved give an equally impressive job. Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher are perfect for their roles, both providing (as often weddings do) something new and something old to their acting career list. The film is written surprisingly well, with a fair amount of heart and emotion- in addition to some truly hilarious gags and situations. The timing is everything in this film, and it seems to nail every mark, and honestly kinda stunned me to like it as much as I did. In the end, Wedding Crashers is an extremely enjoyable film that isn't perfect, but damn near close to it.

"bbewnylorac","6","0","0","31 December 2019"," A difficult movie to rate
","I love the premise of Wedding Crashers but I've never been able to watch it to the end. Two friends Jeremy and John (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) spend their summers breaking into strangers' wedding ceremonies and parties to have a free good time, eat, drink and meet women. You'd better believe there are people in the real world who do this! But I think this movie veers too heavily in the 'gross out' direction, when it could have been a little less zany and more of a narrative. The men, as usual, are the stars and drivers of the narrative, and the women are more side-players. Which is a pity, because Rachel McAdams, as Claire, the bridesmaid that John falls for, is very intelligent and could have played a bigger role. On the other hand, I tired of Isla Fisher as Gloria, the kooky sister of Claire, who starts to stalk Jeremy after snaring his interest at her sister's wedding. Fisher goes way over the top in her obsessions, and it gets annoying. I really like Vince Vaughn and he has a ball with his 'strange guy serious about this bizarre lifestyle' schtick. I also like Owen Wilson, who always plays Owen Wilson, the happy-go-lucky slacker who is up for anything. It's a little disturbing to see how the friends lie to, charm and then bed so many nice women, then discard them - it gets a bit creepy, to be honest, and maybe wouldn't be portrayed the same these days. I'm grateful to the editors for casting Christopher Walken as the super preppy politician father of the bride - he's just a gem and loves playing this part. I also love the montage of all the different weddings that Jeremy and John attend - Jewish, Italian, Chinese, Irish and Hindu. It shows that they all have things in common - great food, nice clothes, music and big groups of people out to have a really good time."

The two main characters spend very little time actually crashing weddings. Instead, over half the movie takes place at the mansion of this one family, which is comprised of some of the most cringeworthy, horrible, and incredibly creepy in an uncomfortable way people.

","Two friends who have turned crashing weddings (to score free food, free booze and loose women) into an art form find their values challenged when invited to spend the weekend with a politician and his unmarried daughters in this jovial comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. The two stars have excellent chemistry together and the film gets off to a great start with many funny moments to be had as they crash an extensive variety of weddings while reciting a charter of over one hundred rules to one another, such as ""Rule #16: Always have an up-to-date family tree"" when almost caught out. The fun slows down though when they begin to spend the weekend with the politician. Christopher Walken is solid as always as the community pillar of a man and his family are a nicely eccentric bunch, with Jane Seymour well cast as his cougar wife and Keir O'Donnell delightful as his closeted gay son obsessed with painting. The film tries too hard to have a heart in this section though and subsequently slides into formulaic territory quickly with Wilson winning a girl, losing her through betrayal and then having to win her back. The movie also rather oddly spends more time on Wilson and Vaughn talking about growing up and leaving their wedding crashing days behind than their actual crashing of weddings. It is all a tad too sweet if surely passable as light entertainment."

","I love the premise of the film - two men who avoid commitment have the absurd hobby of crashing the weddings of complete strangers. But I've never watched this movie to the end. I always get bored, and I get to the point where I don't care about what happens to the characters. It's a shame that most scenes go on way too long. Most could be cut by half and still make sense. Owen Wilson, as usual, is completely charming, and he's nicely complemented by sweet love interest Rachel McAdams. Vince Vaughn can be wickedly funny when his character feels out if his depth, but he needed a tight rein from the director in this movie -- instead, he can be really annoying, droning on while trying to be witty. I disliked Isla Fisher's wacky stalker character. It's just silly at times, it's as though she decided to play it over the top, but it jars against the other, more grounded characters. In the family mansion, scenes deteriorate into slapstick. The family just comes across as weird and scary rather than eccentric, which I suspect was the intention. The characters fall back on crude pranks, and the film loses focus."

It's always hilarious, but I also think it's kind of underrated in terms of its dramatic moments...which I think Dobkin and the cast absolutely nail. <br/><br/>This movie also holds a special place in my heart because it's the movie that my wife (then ex-girlfriend) watched on the night we decided to get back together after almost a year apart. And it has become a tradition for the two of us to watch it every year on that exact day because it's such a special memory that we like to re- live. <br/><br/>I've also seen it a number of times with an old friend of mine and we would always recite the lines along with the movie and even talked all the time about crashing a few weddings of our own together. There was even a time where we got into a situation in real life where we were able to recreate a scene from the movie... It was totally unplanned, but the situation presented itself perfectly so we just ran with it. That was a lot of fun. Sadly though that friend and I don't really keep in touch anymore, but it's still great to look back on those times and remember how much fun we had and how the power of one movie could bring two people such happiness...if only for a little while. <br/><br/>I'll love this movie forever because of that and now I can't wait for my next re-watch.

","The story is one of those clichés of comedies; starts a movie with a premise based on a lie, let it develop and peaks and see how the dust settles after the moment of truth, which because it's a comedy, is sure to be a happy ending. The story gets to be more romantic than comedic in a very sort while, particularly because the movie only uses a lengthy montage of scenes to depict the mischief of the wedding crashing. Then the movie gets slower as the romance takes over, and to be frank it gets to be boring. The comedic inserts after the romance part kick in makes the movie instead a confusing one since those inserts are horribly weird. The moments with Todd are well freaky and even the character Sack fits in just to complete the movie's turning point. The acting overall is also quite lame. Owen Wilson didn't really progress and depicts his character here almost the same as any other of his characters. Vince Vaughn's craziness completes the comedic angle perfectly. It's too bad that they whole comedic set only lasted well for a while. Rachel McAdams also didn't really gave any difference to her role. Bradley Cooper's surely a waste in this movie"

","The first time I saw ""Wedding Crashers,"" I thought it was fun. So I watched it again, and wow. Never in my experience has a movie shown its formulaic structure and cheap laughs faster or more thoroughly than this one does upon a second viewing. By the third viewing-- which I did purely out of curiosity-- I felt more like I was autopsying the movie than watching it.<br/><br/>The heroine, Claire Cleary, is the key to this movie. She is the only believable character, and Rachel McAdams is one of those rare actors who can generate chemistry with almost anyone. She's the female equivalent of Mark Ruffalo: engaging and expressive actors, simultaneously exuding strength and vulnerability, intelligence and emotion, all of it in a fully integrated way.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters-- with the exception of Christopher Walken, who manages to bring dignity to his role as patriarch-- are stereotypes, and despicable stereotypes at that, though the strong cast almost brings it off-- hence the relatively healthy 6 rating. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan are overgrown juveniles, though Wilson's character is made redeemable by virtue of his love for Claire. Vaughan is always up to verbal comedy, and here he handles physical comedy well enough, too. A good thing, because he gets wounded in football, again in a hunting accident, an old lady fires a shotgun at him, and Claire's sex-crazed sister (Isla Fisher) gives him a handjob at a family dinner, then later ties him to the bed so she can have her way with him. Later that same night, still tied up, Vince becomes the toy of another stereotype, the brother, a gay artist. The least effort went into the creating the grandmother (Ellen Albertini Dow, 92 at the time), who is a standard a foul-mouthed old woman, the mother (Jane Seymour), a horny middle-aged woman, and the weary-of-white-folks servant (Ron Canada).<br/><br/>The most thankless role, without doubt, belongs to Bradley Cooper as Owen Wilson's nemesis, the insufferable fiancé of Claire. That she would have anything to do with him is perhaps the least plausible part of a movie that is almost wholly without credibility. He's worse than Will Farrell because Farrell's character is never anything but preposterous. As the aging lech who concocts the scheme to seduce bridesmaids at weddings and mourners at funerals, he is played wholly for cheap laughs-- the standard modus operandi for his ilk, the over-rated and under-talented SNL alumnus.<br/><br/>The movie is, of course, also predictable. Formula films are. A lot of talent went into this, but the writers and filmmakers aim to make every scene outrageous, with McAdams as the quiet heart of this desperate, frantic comedy. That she makes you care about her is no small feat."

She is intelligent and striking despite the formula in which the screenplay places her. Isla Fisher steals scenes as the hyper daughter in pursuit of Vaughn. She is kinky to the point where Vaughn is paranoid to remain there any longer. This is where the film takes interesting turns in unusual situations thus avoiding a full formula delivery. Christopher Walken provides great comic monotone as the father of the bride and he nearly catches Vaughn in late night kinky action.

They'll invent tales of their achievements. They'll wear Purple Hearts to the events. And it works. They stuff themselves on cake, oysters, and champagne and the beautiful girls are all over them. They dance to a hora at Jewish weddings. At Irish weddings, they present themselves this way, ""My name is Sean O'Ryan and I want to get drunk.""<br/><br/>Then the inevitable happens. They crash the wedding party attended by the Secretary of State. (John McCain and James Carville do a cameo.) The Secretary is Christopher Walken and he has two gorgeous young daughters. Vaughan falls for the maniacal nympho, who is half his height and given to S/M. Wilson falls for the sensible Rachel McAdams, although she is already engaged to a snooty ex-preppy. It all works out. That's why this can be called a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Actually, the first half of the movie is pretty funny. Yes, the whole shtick is out of one of those raunchy teen-aged comedies, but these guys are funny.<br/><br/>Vincent Vaughan is a tall, beefy loudmouth who seems to have trouble with comedy, although he's got some good lines. He's great as a cheerful villain, as he was in ""Clay Pigeons,"" but light-heartedness almost defeats him and there's a speed bump whenever he has a scene.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson, on the other hand, is good at light comedy. It's hard to imagine his doing anything else. When I first saw him on screen I didn't like him because he resembled Robert Redford, whom I loathe for being more handsome than I, but Wilson grows on you. You get to find that uneven nose endearing. It wanders down the center of his face, an archipelago of flesh.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken is immediately funny. He can't help it. Even in dramatic parts, those wondering eyes, that curious gargle of a New York voice, conjure up the conviction that he thinks being in a movie is absurd, that EVERYTHING is absurd. Maybe he OD'd on Sartre in his youth. He'd be funny as King Lear.<br/><br/>The guru behind this wedding-crashing business is Will Ferrell. I wish he were funny because he tries so hard, but maybe that's the problem, in addition to his chthonic visage. By the end, he's given up crashing weddings and now crashes funerals. He's not as funny as the doddering old mother he sponges off, the tiny lady who suddenly belows, ""Chazz! It's a friend of yours! Get the f*** down here -- and put away your skateboard!"" <br/><br/>The ""girls"" are as good as the boys. Better even, because both Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher are pretty girls. Fisher, as Walken's younger daughter, whacks off Vaughan under the table at the family dinner and leaves him tied up at night so that the family's creepy homosexual son can have a go at him. There is a rich hint of lunacy in her squint.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is revoltingly cute. She could have been drawn by a cartoonist. Every singular feature is in its rightful place and her bottom wriggles deliciously when she walks.<br/><br/>I got a kick out of it until it bogged down in its second half, when it got a little maudlin about true love being the awareness of one soul of a corresponding resonance in another soul or some such nonsense. Still, some of the lines show that a bit of thought went into them. ""He's so dumb he thinks Moby Dick is a venereal disease."""

","Review of Wedding Crashers (Dobkin 2005)- May contain spoilers<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers (Dobkin 2005) is a romantic comedy that deals with the love of two of the main characters and their journey toward being together. The movie has many high points like the vast array of one-liners, hilarious duo of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, and a great first half, but overall the movie is just good. The second half of the movie seems to fade in humor and be overly predictable, which makes it drag on through some parts. These few things separate the movie from being a truly great comedy. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, there are key points that lead me to think that the movie will become increasingly funny throughout. It starts off by showing John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) going to a bunch of different types of weddings. They are laughing and joking around with all of the families and really fitting in where they are not invited. Also, while at the weddings, they get shown picking up a variety of different girls with a bunch of different lines. They do everything from cry to saying that they were on the Yankees, and they have a line for getting out of answering any questions the girls may have for them. This line is basically that they lost good men in their profession and they do not want to talk about it. After the montage of all these weddings, the duo of John and Jeremy decide to go to one final wedding, the Cleary's. After this final wedding they all go back to the Cleary's house where they play football and Jeremy gets hurt, the grandmother rambles on about her thoughts, and Jeremy gets shot in the butt. During all of this time John and Jeremy have a bunch of one-liners. Some of these lines are things like ""rule number 76: No excuses. Play like a champion"", ""Mom! The meatloaf!"", and ""I got a stage-five clinger""(IMDb.com). All of the aspects of the first half of the movie made it interesting to watch, but once they left the house things began to fade in humor.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie barely had any jokes. Peter Travers states, ""the film limps a bit in the final stretch like a wedding guest who knows how to party but doesn't know when to go home""(Rolling Stone). The only part of it that was partly funny was when John went to meet Chazz (Will Ferrell). Even the part with Chazz was only slightly funny because of the character's insane plans that go beyond crashing weddings to instead crashing funerals. Besides this one part the entire second half consists of John being depressed and mad at everyone including Jeremy, who is about to end up getting married and asks John to be his best man. John, instead of being happy for Jeremy, just sulks around thinking he has lost the girl that he loves, but the entire audience knows what is going to end up happening in the end. All this misery takes away from the laughter in the beginning by completely changing the mood for the worse. The sadness during the end affects everyone who is in the movie as well as the audience. ""Even Vaughn and Wilson seem to have the wind taken out of their sails"" according to Mark Englehart, who wrote a review of the film for IMDb.com.<br/><br/>The movie also becomes extremely predictable from right before John and Jeremy get thrown out of the house until the end. Every move that is made could have been guessed by just about anyone in the audience. The audience could tell as soon as Sack called his buddy to dig up information about John and Jeremy that the duo would be kicked out of the house and be found as frauds. After this it is not hard to figure out that by the end John and Claire (Rachel McAdams), the woman he loves, will get back together at Gloria (Isla Fisher) and Jeremy's wedding. This predictability takes away from all of the wonder established in the beginning about what is going to happen next. <br/><br/>In all, the movie had its great and funny moments that made it a movie worth seeing. The actors all did a great job in establishing all of the characters, so that the audience could get to know who they are. The movie established a variety of jokes and humor, but also had its down points. The predictability and sadness that took place toward the end of the movie are the only things that made this movie go from a great comedy to just a good one. Even with how the ending goes the movie is still definitely worth seeing at some point. Works Cited Englehart, Mark. ""Wedding Crashers."" IMDb. IMDb.com, n.d. Web. 24 Feb. 2014. Travers, Peter.

","Wedding Crashers is one of my favorite movies. It is a must see for everyone. It is a hilarious comedy about two friends that crash weddings to meet girls. It is going good for them until they hook up with some girls at a wedding and go back to their family's estate. At the estate everything goes wrong and turns into one hilarious adventure. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have amazing chemistry together and make a hilarious combination. It also as a great supporting cast including Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, and Bradley Cooper. Will Ferrell also appears in a hilarious uncredited role. Overall I give this movie a 10 because it is amazing! If you have not seen Wedding Crashers yet you really need to. I defiantly think they should make a sequel."

When they crash the wedding of the season, John falls completely for bridesmaid Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) breaking all the rules. Jeremy must submit to her sex-crazed sister Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher) as his loyal wingman.<br/><br/>The concept is great. Some of the jokes work but some really don't.

","On paper, Wedding Crashers seemed rather interesting but the end result is far from living up to the expectations.<br/><br/>What strikes is that the movie is far too long: that type of comedy shouldn't last more than 1h45 max. The consequence is that the good parts such as the family diner, and god knows there are only a few, are lost in a mass of more or less interesting scenes.<br/><br/>The comical potential is therefore unexploited, one can count the gags on the fingers of one hand and most of them fall flat. On top of that, the script develops a corny romantic side that takes up a lot (too much) space.<br/><br/>One won't remember either the cast's performances, and certainly not Owen Wilson's, completely bland as the movie itself."

",".The Frat Pack had over the years took the comical movies by storm. With the Wilson Brothers, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Jack Black they had really got their brand of formula of comedy down to a tee. I have really gotten a kick of the films they starred in including ""Old School"", Dodgeball"", Zoolander"" and of course ""Wedding Crashers"". Unless you are all living under a rock, you should expect by now that their kind of comedy isn't subtle or dry. The comedy depicted here is basically lewd, crude and downright rude. The leading protagonists will likely be kicked around a lot in the private areas. Toilet jokes will also be likely to come up here and there. There is likely to be a pairing with one of the two (in this case Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn). with the possibility of a cameo with another Frat Packer. And of course you will expect the pivotal tender scene where we reveal the hero's softer side which leads to the climax where our hero emerges victorious and lets not forget an engaging montage.<br/><br/>Some people may call it a formulaic comedy, but I like to refer to it as a tradition and to me I ask why spoil a good thing? But unlike the other Frat Pack movies, ""Wedding Crashers"" has some substance added to it. I was impressed by the female leads' performances. Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams were phenomenal as the love interests for John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey (Wilson and Vaughn) who also happen to be the daughters of the treasury secretary. Bradley Cooper is quite hilarious as preppy guy who's not all that sane. Jane Seymour sinks her teeth into some comic support as the Secretary's wife who tries to seduce John. Will Ferrell has a unsettling cameo as a man trying to search for girls at funerals. Sadly though, Christopher Walken doesn't really have that much to do.<br/><br/>What separates ""Wedding Crashers"" from the other Frat Pack Movies before and after is that we see a familiar story of grown-up boys morphing into men. For John and Jeremy, they eventually find their true love by way of irony when all they really wanted was to crash wedding parties just to get an easy #$%$. So in spite of the side-splitting laughter, there is a bit of coming-of-age that's exhibited behind the the insane zaniness of ""Wedding Crashers"". Based on the fans' ovation at the theatre, this movie was the most hilarious comedy of the year. That and the hilarious ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin."" <br/><br/>For those who are sensitive about the content, I should warn you that there's a lot of nudity and sexual references delivered here. Quite a lot of smoking and drinking involved. There's a lot of cussing in the language department. In addition to that there are scenes involving foot fetishes and bondage. For the homophobes out there there is also gay acts as well. If these situations offend you in any way, it's never too late to turn back now."

The settings are luscious, the music excellent, the editing impeccable, the women beautiful, the complex dialogs fast paced, and the story engrossing.<br/><br/>There are only 2 things I would say pushed the envelope too far. 1) The fact that Vince Vaughn's character has some serious issues concerning food.

And then they crash the wrong wedding...<br/><br/>This is a great set-up. The chemistry between Vaughan and Wilson is good, and there is some terrific support (especially from Jane Seymour and Isla Fisher, who gives us a ghastly, quasi-psychotic, giggly girlie which is hysterical).<br/><br/>This is also a great vehicle for the screen personae which Vaughan and Wilson have trotted out in pretty much every movie they have made since.

They do quite well until they attend one wedding inpaticular. Wilson sees a girl and instantly falls in love with her. Then the movie goes on from there with him trying to win his love.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like about this movie was this. OK so they go to weddings planning on sleeping with girls but oh wait owen sees a girl he instantly falls in love with (sort of stupid and cliché in my book) also after the first half of the movie the comedy dies its all romance.<br/><br/>If you are into romantic comedies this one is definitely for you.

"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","0","23 September 2009"," Slightly overrated perhaps, but it still passes as a raunchy romantic comedy
","This R-rated romantic comedy, starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, was a big hit at the box office in 2005, but it didn't really catch my attention until early 2006, when it was highly recommended to me. By then, I had missed the opportunity to go and see it on the big screen, but it wasn't long before I rented a copy on DVD, simply because of the recommendation. I guess I was fairly impressed with it, even though I can't remember that first viewing very well, and couldn't think of any memorably hilarious moments. Over three years later, I've finally seen it again. Because of its popularity, I had reasonable expectations, and while I still may not completely understand the huge heaps of praise it has received, I think it was better for me with my second viewing, as it was funnier and more memorable.<br/><br/>John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey are two lifelong friends, both single and working together as divorce mediators. They have a hobby of crashing weddings, and have a set of rules to follow for it. They get into the weddings under false identities, claiming to be related to the newlyweds. After they get in, both of them manage to attract vulnerable bridesmaids and get into bed with them just for one night. They never seem to fail! However, things don't go according to plan when John and Jeremy go to crash the wedding of Christina Cleary, the daughter of Secretary William Cleary. At this wedding the two friends set their sights on Claire and Gloria Cleary, two other daughters of William, but John actually falls in love with Claire! Jeremy makes out on the beach with Gloria, who turns out to be a sex-obsessed psychopath! John and Jeremy end up breaking the rules of wedding crashing and going to the Cleary family's island mansion, but they obviously can't keep their true identities secret forever! <br/><br/>The film is funny around the beginning, with our two main characters on the job as divorce mediators. I can't think of any super-lame gags, but the film may be a tad dull for a while. I think most of the film at least had me snickering, and some parts definitely made me laugh harder than that. Before they get to the island mansion, the funniest part MIGHT be John and Jeremy at a wedding, being caught swearing in church by people in front of them. I would say it improves when they get to the island mansion, as some really funny things happen here, such as Jeremy getting knocked down twice while playing football and saying he can't breathe, the scene with Jeremy and Gloria in the bathroom, Grandma Mary Cleary's insults, what Jeremy goes through when he's tied to the bed, etc. There's also a lot of very funny and often raunchy dialogue, and Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good as the two main characters. Certain other cast members contribute to the humour, most notably Isla Fisher as the sex-crazed Gloria. Will Ferrell in the small role of Chazz Reinhold is also funny, if you like the comedian.<br/><br/>This is another crude comedy, and there are parts many people could find offensive, such as Jeremy tied to the bed and raped. If that sounds revolting to you, ""Wedding Crashers"" is probably a film you should stay away from, though I get the feeling I'm making it sound a tad heavier than it actually is. To me, there aren't too many really low points in the film, but one that really stands out is John beaten up by Zachary ""Sack"" Lodge (Claire's fiancée) as Sack's thug friends hold the victim, which really seems misplaced in a movie like this. It looks more like a scene from a crime drama than a romantic comedy. However, that is only one small part of the film, and fortunately, the rest isn't like that. For the most part, this 2005 smash hit comedy is a good, raunchy, silly romp, and the humour wasn't the only thing that kept my interest. The romance isn't bad, either. So, while not for kids (I'm sure you know it is rated R), and not for adults who hate crude comedies, I can see why this film has appeal."

","At one point of this David Dobkin 2005 comedy hit (Budget: $40, 000, 000. Gross revenue: $285, 176, 741) Owen Wilson's character John, one of the wedding crashers certainly, asks to the woman he loves (beautiful Rachel McAdams plays Claire Cleary) this: ""would be a total cliché if I kissed you now?"" and she says ""Yes"" and he kisses her. The end of the movie is there, the end of the very typical movie is there, the good guy is finally with the woman he loves and that woman is finally with the guy she loves and did not make the mistake of getting married with the all good and rich boyfriend of hers that actually is a complete a*****. You know, sure Wedding Crashers is predictable, nothing we haven't seen before and stuff but still it delivers, if you ask me is quite a recommendation for comedy fans that haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>Here we have the wedding crashers, John and Vince Vaughn's character Jeremy and we have first the sort of montage to see these wedding crashers in action, you know lying, enjoying the weddings, getting the girls, they're experts, they really know about weddings. Second stage is the reflection of one of them, John to be exact, the thoughts after the just finished ""wedding season"", ""we are irresponsible, we are not that young"" that sort of thoughts. Later there's a wedding out of the ""season"", certainly the big special one, certainly the one that will deliver the main story and is John in love and Jeremy pretty much suffering a bit with two nuts (Gloria Cleary and Todd Cleary, played by Isla Fisher and Keir O'Donnell). I repeat, this is typical so there will be the classic moment when the girl that John fell in love with and the rest of her family (Christopher Walken plays the dad, the US Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary. As some have pointed, with Walken's character we have the Jack Byrnes of this film, well actually not really but that's just something we think of the moment we meet Walken's character so with that character the movie is not predictable which means we have nothing memorable with this character, nothing as funny as the stuff with his mother!) find out the truth, find out that John and Jeremy are not brothers, are liars, are just wedding crashers (a moment courtesy of the ""villain"": Claire's boyfriend and future husband, played by Bradley Cooper) and of course the moment with John being like ""Claire: sure it's true I'm a wedding crasher but the guy you met, the guy that made you laugh and stuff is really who I am"" and the moment with John and Jeremy breaking their friendship and well, of course the just f****** hilarious moments! It's a darn funny movie (Vaughn being the one who is especially funny. For instance, I loved his ""conversation"" with Janice and with father O'Neil!). <br/><br/>Apart of Wedding Crashers I have seen exactly 6 movies that have Will Ferrell in them (and I'm not familiar at all with SNL), pretty much I always find him amusing but never really hilarious until this movie (which I just saw today for the very first time, by the way), here Ferrell is just f****** hilarious! He plays Chazz Beinghold, this guy is like the wedding crashing master, the pioneer and he appears in the movie at the time when John is into books like ""Don' Jump! Life's really worth it"". Chazz is totally in another level, he is now a damn funeral crasher! So f***** up, so f***** up, anyway Wedding Crashers is a worthy comedy choice."

This had very few moments that satisfied this expectation. A letdown.<br/><br/>It isn't that it was formulaic; there was familiar territory here to be sure, but it didn't go completely as I figured it would. It's just that they had some golden opportunities for laughs that they glossed over. The psychotic, clingy girlfriend could have been played up a lot more with the Vince's side of the story. The trailer made you think that they would use that more. All I can say is that it was disappointing."
"Alfredo_Griselda","6","0","0","28 September 2008"," A Chick Flick for Guys
","When I first saw the advertisement for Wedding Crashers, I thought it was a typical frat boy romp, involving two older men who should know better going after all the tasty young things that are grieving over their bleak futures at weddings. It's the perfect plan. But the movie advertised in the trailers is very different from the actual film. Wedding Crashers is actually a sappy love story, complete with theories about true love and the harsh reality that two guys who cruise weddings for chicks are a little pathetic. Depending on your perspective, this is actually a good thing (the movie brings something different to a tired genre) or a bad thing (it is not all about drunk girls getting naked). Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) are best friends forever. So much so that the night of John's parents' death, Jeremy sleeps over to keep him company. Aren't they sweet? They are also high-powered lawyers, arbitrating nasty divorces. They'd be quite the catch...if it weren't for the fact that these two guys crash weddings. Their jobs help convey why they're so cynical about weddings and also how they can charm their way through just about anything. That all changes when they meet the Clearys. The Clearys are a high-powered political family. Heading the brood of faux-Kennedys is the patriarch (Christopher Walken), his boozing, horny wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour), his gay son Todd (Keir O'Donnell), grandma (Ellen Albertini, who was also in the Wedding Singer and still going strong!), and his three daughters: dutiful Christina (Jennifer Alden), smart and sassy Claire (the delightful Rachel McAdams), and raunchy Gloria (Isla Fisher, in full-blown nut-job mode). John meets Claire at Christina's wedding and immediately falls in love. There's just one problem...she's engaged. Of course. And the guy she's engaged to is Zach ""The Sack"" Lodge (Bradley Cooper), a hyper-masculine jock who likes to beat people up. Zach is a complete cad and it's up to John, with a little help from Jeremy, to beat the bad guy, get the girl, and live happily ever after. Somewhere in the middle of all this, Jeremy hooks up with the crazy Gloria and decides she's perfect for him, an ironic twist for the sidekick. Wedding Crashers is wildly uneven, but most of the time you don't mind. Vaughn can be too kinetic, Wilson can be too sedate, and Fisher is so overbearing that she starts to annoy the audience. McAdams, however, lights up the screen with her shy smile. Her magnetic personality even excuses Wilson's incessant mooning over her. And of course, Walken is hilarious whenever he's on screen. That said, the movie is way too long. As a sappy romance that starts out as a frat boy comedy, it swings wildly from one genre to the next. Things take a turn for the worse when Chazz Reinhold (Will Ferrell) shows up, but maybe that's on purpose. Chazz's appearance heralds John's awakening that crashing weddings is really lame, and by that time I felt the same way. Fortunately, the movie wraps up shortly after the Anchorman's arrival. Wedding Crashers is one of those sneaky movies that is much more clever in concept than it is in practice. Fooling men (who only see the trailers and figure it's a comedy) and women (who talk to each other about the movie and thus know what it's actually about) into seeing the same film is a stroke of pure genius. This is probably why Wedding Crashers did so well: it's a chick flick disguised as a guy's movie."

Vaughn meanwhile slips away with yet another daughter, sleeps with her and then finds out too late that she's nuts.

Rachel McAdams is extremely beautiful and talented, too bad her talent is wasted. Isla Fisher is hot as hell and delivers some really funny situations.<br/><br/>The cameos work also really well. So I think I made my point clear; this is the typical American comedy that will make you laugh and will entertain you, but after watching it, you will soon forget about it's events."

","The Wedding Crashers is a rare thing in comedy films - a flick with an almost non-existent point to its story, yet it is riddled with sophisticated humour and a fairly cohesive, enjoyable plot. The film can be split into two if we try and assign a genre to it; it is either a Romance film, or it is a Comedy film. It is not a Rom-Com in the classical sense - it's too silly in places for that. One thing it does particularly well, though, is fulfil its role as a feel-good film, and might - just might - see you looking at areas of your own relationships in a slightly different way. The film's greatest strength lies in the sheer range of well-defined characters. All of them are integral to the film's substance, but the interplay between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan is especially important. The buddy-buddy feel that predominates through the first two thirds of the film gives rise to some of the most memorable lines and quotes I think I can remember from recent films. The roles played by Christopher Walken, and his family, are fantastic. A true achiever in Hollywood, Walken brings his ""ever-so-slightly-creepy"" acting style into line with his obvious comedic talents to sublime effect - perhaps a precursor to his amusing but slightly unnerving role as an Angel of Death in ""Click!"". The inclusion of Will Ferrel as the ninja-master of 'crashing may not be to everyone's taste, but his role is kept to a minimal, and is actually particularly funny. The plot is fairly predictable, so I won't go into it at length; basically two best friends who have daytime jobs as divorce mediates get their kicks out of gatecrashing local weddings, picking up emotional girls and then moving on. The film develops by forcing them to look at the irresponsibility of their behaviour, and offers them both ways out of it in the form of the two lead female characters. But be aware that this one isn't necessary so run of the mill as other comparable movies. It has something slightly more, and that's what makes it worth your while watching on a Friday night, as opposed to one of the other generic rom-com clones that have infected the shelves of your local video store recently. So, a good one to catch as the weekend begins, and you want something to laugh about (that doesn't require too much of that ever-so-absent Friday night brain power!)."

","Owen Wislon and Vince Vaughn, who is an acquired taste, star as ""The Wedding Crashers."" When they aren't working, they crash weddings, intent on eating, drinking and having one-night stands. Simple as that. The predictable plot has Wilson falling hard for a gal (Rachel McAdams of ""The Notebook"" ) at one of the weddings they crash. Unfortunately, she has a serious boyfriend who beats up on Wilson. But Wilson will not be deterred, much to the dismay of Vaughn, who crashes weddings strictly for the reasons cited above and nothing more. Christopher Walken plays the father of McAdams, and he seems out of his element in what is essentially the DeNiro role from ""Meet the Parents."" Vaughn is as usual too much and should be taken outside and shot. Come to think of it, that's exactly what happens to him here. Wilson is funny and endearing as a lovelorn sap who fears he may never win his true love. McAdams, sporting very dark hair, is sweet and affecting as his true love. Her character would have been played by someone like Cameron Diaz 10 years ago. Come to think of it, Diaz did play the same type of role, in 1997's ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" The ending is exactly what you are thinking it is as you read this. The movie holds few surprises, but it makes an OK time killer. Truth be told, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" is a better bet."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","18 June 2008"," A classic comedy that successfully pushes the boundaries
","Of the many things that ""Wedding Crashers"" does really well as a comedy, the one that makes it the most special is that it dared to be rated R and outside the typical comfort zone for a ""love and sex"" comedy not merely by just flashing body parts. The content in this film is something anyone with a mature and open mind can laugh at, it was simply never thought to be included in films until now because it might ""cross the boundaries."" But when you aim for an R rating, I say have fun with it and ""Wedding Crashers"" does just that.<br/><br/>Jeremy Grey (Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Wilson), who have incredible duo chemistry in this film, are self-proclaimed ""wedding crashers"" as in they take advantage of the long guest list for weddings by pretending to be way extended family members so they can get free food and take advantage of love-hungry bachelorettes. All that changes at the Cleary family wedding when John falls for Claire, played by the gorgeous Rachel McAdams, who gives a performance as easy to watch as fish in a tank. John convinces Jeremy to go to the Cleary's summer home so he can continue to court her despite the fact that she has a jerk boyfriend (Bradley Cooper). <br/><br/>Vaughn gives his best performance as Jeremy, the protagonist to whom all terrible/hilarious things happen as a result of going to the Cleary's. Claire's sister hits on him and she proves to be a clingy, sex-crazed maniac, Claire's brother takes a look the wrong way and thinks Jeremy's gay and Claire's boyfriend loves to take Jeremy out anyway he can. I'd go into detail to explain how the boundaries get pushed, but that would spoil it. Vaughn also develops his signature ""rant"" humor in this film which is hysterical. Wilson is great in tandem with Vaughn, though his individual performance is not much different than usual. He's sort of the bridge between the comedic Vaughn and the romantic McAdams, doing both rather well. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour as Mr. and Mrs. Cleary followed by a great cameo at the end help pad the tremendous cast.<br/><br/>McAdams as the infallibly believable Claire really makes this film go from a comedy to a date film and elicit an emotional response from the viewer. Most based-on-sex/romance comedies that lean heavily on the comedy don't really extend that well into the other areas, but McAdams makes that happens as Claire. She's a great call by the casting directors. Aside from a couple scenes and one significant one, it never gets into cheesy territory for too long. It's mostly a fun, boundary-pushing, extremely quotable comedy with appeal for couples, not just guys."

","If you've got something to say constructive or otherwise, say your comment, make your peace and get out! Like many people I think this is a funny film and well worth a view, and I'll get to why in a minute.<br/><br/>Firstly, let's take the basics. This film is kind of like a remake of four weddings and a funeral, it's American name might be several weddings and a funeral or two weddings and a funeral, depending on your point of view. The story centres around 2 professional men in their early thirties who crash weddings in order to sleep with women who want to hook up with a potential partner at a friend or relatives wedding, and while Vince Vaughn's character is living for the chase, Owen Wilson is starting to have doubts over the value of his life and his meaningless existence, and while both characters are shallow there is a great deal of joy in watching their ceaseless adolescent behaviour and the ridiculous rulebook they operate by. All of this changes of course when they decide to end their tenure as wedding crashers by crashing the wedding of the century, when Wilson meets the woman from heaven and Vaughn meets the clingy nutter from hell.<br/><br/>The dialogue is great, yeah, not Woody Allen great but funny, and the characters all likable, with the exception of the villain of the piece who is played to perfection by Bradley Cooper as the scummy version of both Vaughn and Wilson.<br/><br/>Add to this a couple of excellent cameo's, a vile old woman and a repressed artist and you have a bizarre mix that, yes, is a tad predictable, but like a journey to one of your favourite places, is one that you do enjoy nonetheless.<br/><br/>Nuff said.<br/><br/>Em"

","Wedding Crashers is a romantic comedy in which Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play two bachelors who 'crash' weddings for fun. They research information about weddings, show up uninvited, and play characters such as the fun, unknown third cousins. Their purpose in all of this is to eat tasty, free food and drinks while picking up girls. The movie focuses on the crash of one particular wedding  that of Secretary Cleary's daughter. Vaughn hits it off with one of the bridesmaids, but then finds out that she is particularly clingy and wants to leave immediately. Wilson, however, falls for another bridesmaid and convinces Vaughn to attend the post-wedding family excursion to buy him more time with the girl. He later finds out that she has a boyfriend, but he pursues her non-the less. During the week with the family, Vaughn puts up with countless humorous difficulties and is forced to stay by Wilson. However, at the end of their week with the newlyweds' family, they discover Vaughn and Wilson's true identity and the girls no longer want anything to do with them. In the end they make it home in one piece, but Wilson becomes depressed because he failed to get the girl of his dreams.<br/><br/>The humor of this movie is what holds together the rather lengthy plot. Most comedies can only hold audiences for a shorter film length of maybe 90 minutes, but the natural chemistry between Vaughn and Wilson keeps the audience engaged for nearly two hours. At first I thought that the humor was somewhat immature and would only appeal to the minds of high school or college students, but the movie quickly became a family favorite around my house. The beginning of the movie is fast paced and features punch line after punch line as the viewer follows Vaughn and Wilson around countless weddings as their senses of humor allow them to be the hits of reception. They woo multiple women with false stories about events such as 'losing good men in war' which are always followed up by an emotional tear that snags every woman and brings a laugh from the audience.<br/><br/>While the pair spends a week with the family of the secretary, the real plot of the romance follows Wilson on his pursuit of the secretary's daughter. Wilson appears to be somewhat desperate, but the daughter, Claire, seems to fall for him. His fun loving nature gives her a well needed break from her stuffy boyfriend. Their budding relationship is appealing because of its innocence; Wilson pulls her in with walks on the beach and simple games and jokes that remind the audience of a high school sweetheart type of relationship.<br/><br/>While the story follows Wilson's romance, Vaughn holds together the humor of the story. He deals with countless intimate advances by multiple members of the family, creating awkward situations for Vaughn make him constantly beg Wilson to leave. This puts a sense of urgency on Wilson's courting of Claire. I love how this movie does a great job of incorporating the humor with an interesting yet simple plot. The end takes an interesting turn it's not for me to ruin, just highly recommend if you're in the mood for a refreshing, light-hearted comedy."

And I for once, look for standards, that unfortunately most movies fail to hit or to come by, as is this one.<br/><br/>The comedy part is great (I've only seen the theatrical cut), Owen and Vince work great together. The beginning of the movie is fast and has some hilarious moments ... it even works out up to the point of the one wedding, that is going to be very crucial for both of them. After that there are of course not many big surprises coming up (you'll know where it all leads eventually), so it's a shame the second part is overshadowed with so much drama ... drama and problems, that don't seem real (in the context of the movie and the relationships of the characters that is).<br/><br/>If you're not thinking too much as I did, you might enjoy this movie more than I did, but I just saw too much missed opportunities in this."

","Every critic I have read and person I have spoken to disliked this movie. After seeing it recently, I disagree. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are brilliant as con artists who go to weddings to pick up women. Yes, you can't pick up women that easily in real life, but it is a comedy. Wilson and Vaughn are hilarious in showing how a big male ego can get you by in the World. They are both highly immature, but you can't help admiring the verve of the two. If you are thinking that this is the entire point of the movie, no, it isn't. Wilson meets the daughter (Rachel McAdams)of the Secretary of State (Christopher Walken). The patrician family is on the surface chic, but in reality a collection of misfits. The rival in the movie is terrific as someone who thinks that the World owes him everything, simply because he is rich. There are many great moments in the movie. There is a walk on role by Will Farrell as a ""funeral crasher"". Farrell is very funny.

","Wedding Crashers is a movie that has some fine parts but in the end those parts don't quite add up to form a satisfying whole. This is a film in which the whole is somehow less than the sum of its parts. The plot is straightforward and simple as can be, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson playing two guys who crash weddings to pick up women. That's the entire plot and it seems that the writers figured they could just set up that premise and much hilarity would then ensue. Unfortunately only intermittent hilarity ensues. When it's good, Wedding Crashers is very good but the comic energy is never really sustained. There are far too many scenes where nothing, certainly nothing very funny, happens.<br/><br/>As Jeremy and John respectively Vaughn and Wilson are pretty much what you would expect them to be. Vaughn's the fast-talking yapper, Wilson much more relaxed. Each fills their respective role well. The movie takes off, or at least is meant to, when Wilson's John falls for Claire Cleary, the beautiful daughter of the Treasury Secretary, at Claire's sister's wedding. Meanwhile yet another Cleary sister, Gloria, clings to Vaughn's quite reluctant Jeremy. Our two crashers find themselves invited back to the Cleary family compound where John will continue to woo Claire, conveniently ignoring the fact she is about to be engaged to a raving lunatic, while Jeremy tries to wriggle free of the just a little bit crazy Gloria. Plenty of potential for comic gold it would seem but it never all comes together.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the object of John's affection, Claire as played by Rachel McAdams, is impossibly dull and almost completely devoid of any personality. Almost nothing funny happens when McAdams is on the screen. Undeniably attractive but utterly boring, it's hard to see why John would instantly fall for this woman he doesn't even know. There's nothing remarkable about her. Probably not McAdams' fault, I'm sure she has a personality but her character surely doesn't. By contrast Gloria, as played by Isla Fisher, absolutely oozes personality and the movie comes to life every time Fisher is on the screen. Fisher repeatedly steals scenes from that noted scene-stealer himself Vince Vaughn. Her all-too-brief appearances are the highlights of the film. Unfortunately we spend much more time with the rather dull by comparison Wilson/McAdams would-be romance. Also notable, and not in a good way, is Bradley Cooper playing Claire's ridiculously over-the-top evil fiancée Sack. He's so bad you cringe every time he's on the screen. Comedies are not generally meant to induce cringing. And Christopher Walken as Treasury Secretary Cleary, the head of this rather bizarre family, is woefully underused. It's obvious he could have added a great deal to the movie if given the opportunity but instead we are stuck with the boring Claire, the obnoxious Sack and a host of other characters who add next to nothing. With some terrific actors in the cast, a surprising standout performance from Fisher and some real moments of comic genius along the way you get the sense Wedding Cashers could have been something truly great. Instead it's just OK and will leave you wanting more and wondering what could have been."

One day they decide to crash the biggest wedding in the country, that of a politician's daughter. While at this wedding both guys meet women who they decide they want to spend more than just one night with.

","A lot of hype surrounded this film while it was in theaters and continued with its recent release onto DVD. I've lately halted when I hear resounding praise lavished on films with nary a single negative comment to be found. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was one such film that I enjoyed but didn't live up to the brouhaha surrounding it.<br/><br/>And such was the case with WEDDING CRASHERS ...<br/><br/>Although pleasantly funny and entertaining (note the ""thumbs up"" rating I gave it for sheer entertainment), the film lost much of its lighthearted punch as the story bogged down in the drama surrounding its two main characters, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson, STARSKY AND HUTCH) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn, DODGEBALL).<br/><br/>The basic premise is about these two longtime friends who enjoy crashing as many weddings as possible. They have hundreds of rules that each of them follows (""Rule #1: Never leave a fellow crasher alone"", etc) ...that is until John falls for a beautiful woman named Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams, THE NOTEBOOK) and all bets are called off.<br/><br/>John and Jeremy's friendship appears to be on the rocks as John falls harder and harder for Claire. But problems quickly arise for him. Claire is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken, THE PROPHECY), an authoritative man who wants his daughters to marry into families of wealth and power. The Cleary family is also pretty dysfunctional (""putting the 'fun' in dysfunctional""). They have a son, Todd (Keir O'Donnell, IN YOUR FACE), who wants nothing to do with the family's politics and prefers painting evocative scenes in ""his own blood."" The Cleary mother, Kathleen (Jane Seymour, DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN), is sexually deprived and wants young men to ""touch her surgically enhanced breasts."" John clearly has a lot of obstacles to overcome ...and not just within the Cleary family. Claire's long-term boyfriend, Zack Lodge (Bradley Cooper, ALIAS), wants to know who John and Jeremy are and how they became so close to the Cleary family so quickly.<br/><br/>As John's love for Claire grows, Jeremy is dragged further away from his friend by the surrounding circumstances and by another Cleary daughter with serious psychological issues that he later finds endearing.<br/><br/>As you can see, there's a lot going on in this film. At two hours in length, it's one of the more long-winded comedies I've seen.<br/><br/>Mixing drama, romance and humor is always a challenge, and director David Dobkin admirably tries to hold it all together, and on some levels he does, but the ending fell flat with no laughs and zero character growth (they just expand their wedding crasher community from two to four members).<br/><br/>I will say that seeing Jane Seymour in such a different role surprised me. She played the part of a bored politician's wife extremely well. But Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were just Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn; men who never grew up. Whenever they're on-screen together, however, there were definitely some great comedic moments (""Oh. You didn't hear. My brother had a diving accident and he's retarded now."") But if you're looking for a high quality comedy, this isn't it. It is funny at times, but when compared to such masterpieces as THE BIG LEBOWSKI or OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU, it seriously pales."

All in all you will like it if you are a teen or into those drama or should I say an immature adult drama; slightly above teen but nothing at the top. I still would recommend people to see this movie just because it is hilarious and that is what saved the movie."

","all my friends told me this movie was hilarious. They said this movie is a gut-buster.

Sure this movie had its moments of slight laughter, but for its all obscenities, this film seemed very tame to what it should be.

","So... I liked the movie & it was funny like all of the other ones... but come on! Vincey baby.. he has so much talent but if he plays the same role in every movie, he'll far so far that even his performance in swingers couldn't save him. Also Owen Wilson needs to tone it down a little cause its obvious that hes the weaker of the Wilson brothers. The movie itself was a solid plot and it had Walkin in it and thats enough for me. However I thought some of the other characters were poor at best. The grandma? What a cheap laugh.

","Warning: Vaughn talks fast in this movie. Other warnings I should mention about: the movie isn't that funny until we see Gloria and Claire. The jokes are few and far between. The Rules of Wedding Crashing that you see in the Trivia page for this movie are irrelevant. The story, mind you, holds up and for 2005, it does stand unchallenged for the adult comedy of that year.<br/><br/>Two divorce mediators have an interesting hobby. They crash weddings to bed the bridesmaids. Inevitably, one falls in love for his prey.<br/><br/>What kind of a name is Sack anyway? You will laugh at least one point in the movie.

"EUyeshima","7","0","0","18 January 2006"," Wiseguy Rapport Sharpened for Funny, Post-Frat House Comedy With an Original Premise
","A great premise drives a hybrid comedy that mixes the ""buddy"" picture with ""American Pie"" hijinks and more conventional romantic comedy elements. It doesn't always work, but director David Dobkin and co-screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher get a lot of mileage out of the idea of two horndog divorce lawyers who crash weddings in their native D.C. area to lure sexually available women. Originating from a Big Kahuna of wedding crashing (who shows up late in the movie to offer an updated approach), the strategy of the partners in crime, John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, is to abide by their incessant rulebook and show up at events like they were invited and be prepared to present themselves with creatively concocted bios as tangible connections to either the bride or the groom.<br/><br/>It all sounds like a prime opportunity for tasteless, vulgar humor and at various points, it is, but the film can also be surprisingly clever and even insightful. The set-up is actually more interesting than the ensuing plot, which relies much more on convention as it focuses on the high-profile nuptials of a US senator's daughter and the predictable romantic complications therein. As the smoother of the two, Owen Wilson plays John with his trademark glibness and laid-back manner. In romancing the senator's middle daughter Claire, he even manages to eke out sincerity in measured doses, although he lacks the gravitas to be a truly effective romantic lead. As Jeremy, whether egging John about his exposure to the available breasts of the senator's wife, fending off the advances of Claire's sister and brother, or confessing profusely to a somewhat titillated minister, Vince Vaughn is a motor-mouthed riot, as he suffers an escalating number of indignities in order to keep up the guises while John woos Claire. Together, they are like a post-frat house version of Crosby and Hope in one of their Road movies.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken plays the strait-laced senator with just a hint of his potential lunacy, though I was wishing he could break free more like he does in his ""Saturday Night Live"" skits. In a role that begs for the effortless savvy of Joan Allen or Jean Smart, the still-beautiful Jane Seymour just seems sadly misused as his wife. The current ""it"" girl, Rachel McAdams has the presence of mind and spirit to make more of the lackluster role of romantically confused Claire than there really is, though it's Isla Fisher who steals her scenes with abandon as Claire's alternately smitten and psychotic baby sister Gloria. Truth be told, the film starts to drag in the home stretch as it takes its time toward the inevitable conclusion, but the cleverly tasteless take on funerals is a nice jab. Regardless, Wilson and especially Vaughn, with his non-stop stream-of-consciousness wit, generate enough goodwill and laughs to compensate for the occasional lapses along the way.<br/><br/>The ""Uncorked"" DVD package is somewhat disappointing. It contains two versions of the film, the original theatrical one and another billed as ""uncorked"", though the difference amounts to a few additional moments and lines here and there. There are two commentary tracks  an informative albeit by-the-numbers one by Dobkin and a looser though rather lazy and low-key one by Wilson and Vaughn. Neither is essential. There are four deleted scenes, including a karaoke scene with the two guys endlessly singing Nena's ""99 Luftballoons"". The extras just prove that the final film was edited correctly when it was released."

","Wedding Crashers seemed very trite and not really needed when it came into theaters, so I was reluctant to check it out. When it came out on DVD, I saw it and something was still off. I think I'm used to seeing these two actors (Vaughn and Wilson) in totally different films all the time that their staying-power just seems weird. That being said, I had fun while watching it, but the whole movie seemed improbable.<br/><br/>My favorite moments had to be when Vaughn's character, Jeremy, gets pummeled, tied up, raped, molested by a family member, and eventually, Jeremy gets into the whole thing to the point that he wants to marry this freaky girl. Wilson did a great job as the guy who wants to stop going to weddings to meet girls and hook up with them, and he wants to settle down with one girl in particular (Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and The Notebook). And always great was Christopher Walken, who stepped down a notch in his importance to the film for this one, although his role as the love-interests' father is a pivotal role.<br/><br/>I didn't like the improbability that no one ever kicked them out of the weddings they attended, even if they had horrible alibis. And after awhile, the film was understood but kept going until the happy ending, drama-romance filler that every other movie has. The only real thing that makes it different is the cameo (again) by Will Ferrell (playing Chazz Reinhold, the originator at the game of picking up at important family get-togethers, like weddings and funerals).<br/><br/>I gave it a 7/10 stars. It was worth checking out. It wasn't extraordinary, but the characters and actors in the movie made up for a boring genre which needs better writing in the future."

"cwrdlylyn","8","0","0","6 January 2006"," WEDDING CRASHERS : Brilliant Movie, Minus 25 Excessive Minutes...
","WEDDING CRASHERS<br/><br/>First off, Vince Vaughn is an incredibly talented comedian. Watching the films he makes now, it's amazing to think that he ever played a role like Norman Bates in the remake of PSYCHO. His rapid fire comedic ramblings have really helped drive him into being one of todays best screen comedians.<br/><br/>In this film, he is paired up with a game, if not as funny, Owen Wilson. THE WEDDING CRASHERS was one of the biggest comedy hits of this past year, and deservedly so. At times the film had a completely raunchy sense of humor akin to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and ANIMAL HOUSE, yet it maintains a gloss and intelligence throughout that I think sets it ahead of those movies.<br/><br/>I've always found SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and ANIMAL HOUSE to be incredible comedies, but flawed b/c they never grabbed me and made me care about the plot. WEDDING CRASHERS managed to play out a convincing love story while never losing it's wild edge.<br/><br/>Much credit belongs to Rachel McAdams for perfectly embodying the perfect girl in this film. She's gorgeous, approachable, fun, sexy, and a challenge all at once. I've yet to see THE NOTEBOOK and THE FAMILY STONE, but between this and MEAN GIRLS, it's obvious the girl is incredibly talented. Isla Fisher offers manic comedic support as her sister and has great chemistry with Vaughn.<br/><br/>The main problem I've read about the film is it's length... and it is indeed unnecessarily long. Basically, it was obvious how things would end up from the very beginning... and yet the film drags on for about 25 minutes too long in the end trying to create suspense. <br/><br/>In the end, this doesn't really add anything to the ""love story"" aspect. In fact, it lets the film drift too far into a corny place where it never should have gone. On top of that, I would like to note that throwing Will Ferrell and his over the top antics into a movie in the last 20 minutes is pointless, and kind of annoying. Ferrell is incredibly funny in the right context... here, he's a nuisance. <br/><br/>Also, some subplots and characters are severely underdeveloped. The weird brother and Jane Seymour's character showed up at random moments for blatant laughs, and they are funny. But they just seem to pop up whenever convenient... and in a comedy so well developed, their characters seem like mere plot tricks to conjure up a few more laughs.<br/><br/>Overall though, despite the length, the film maintained my interest and had me laughing harder than any other film has in a long time. <br/><br/>Best Moments - * The dinner table conversations * Vaughn tied to the bed * The opening wedding montage<br/><br/>Slightly flawed... but it's a comedy, not a perfect film. For what it aims to do, it nearly hits the bullseye. Unfortunately the director didn't leave Will Ferrell and the last 25 minutes and the editing room floor.<br/><br/>... B+ ..."

","I'm not sure what all the ""HYPE"" was about. It did have some very funny moments in the movie, but it definitely will not be up for any Oscars this year. Unless you are in to seeing two middle-aged men crashing weddings and making fools of themselves to get attention (and other things) from women. (very sad if this is true of any of you out there). It was extremely disgusting when Will Ferrell made an entrance! YUCK! This is not a movie I would rush out & buy, but it wasn't horrible. I'll give it that much. Most of it was just plain silly, but I'm a Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson fan, so I went to see it. I was VERY disappointed. Maybe this was a ""MAN's"" movie ~ and I'm not a man. It also seems like Owen is getting a bit type-cast, tho'. Nearly every movie he's been in ~ he seems to have to do those speeches about ""living to love and be loved ~ find happiness""... Not a bad thing ~ but he just seems to do the ""speech"" to a woman his character is in love with."

","I don't give any movie a 10...but this one is close. The concept is original (or at least I've not seen anything like it). The humor is sharp. The lines are delivered in a crisp believable manner and what happens could really happen in real life. The two guys act like friends and say the things that friends say. The situations too, could exist in real life just as shown. It probably would have been even closer to a 10 without the T&A displays, and if most of the F words were eliminated from the script.

","Those looking for a few no-brainer laughs may take it; those easily offended by sexual vulgarity (don't have a definition but the ""under the table scene"", if you've seen the movie, could be a candidate) may want to leave it.<br/><br/>Structurally speaking, look at it as a three-act, multi-scene play with a prologue.<br/><br/>The prologue is a fast moving sequence of all the weddings John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are crashing, meaning pretending to be relatives, eat and drink until they throw up and pickup and bed someone in the process. A bit too long for a prologue but maybe to drive home the point that this pair does have A LOT OF weddings to crash.<br/><br/>Act 1, THE wedding of the year they don't want to miss despite the fact that they are totally exhausted. This act is actually quite well done, providing a few laughs and introducing the somewhat strange family: typical all-American senator (or some such people)(Christopher Walken), his seemingly sex-starved wife (Jane Seymore), lovely daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), crazy sex-maniac daughter (Isla Fisher), weirdo son, wacky grandmother and psychotic future son-in-law. You get the picture.<br/><br/>Act 2, the main body of the story, takes place in the senator's (or some such people) residence in crab-cake country where the party is spending a supposedly idyllic weekend. Needless to say, all sorts of things happen, and more laughs. Coming out of it though is also the familiar tale of bad-guy-turn-good-at-first-true-love. If you belong to the population that detest ""vulgar"" sex jokes, you may find that this sequence at least, between John and Claire, is tastefully done.<br/><br/>Act 3 is the usually finale that gets the protagonists out of trouble, with everybody living happily ever after.<br/><br/>The acting job is quite well done. McAdams and Wilson make a lovely and lovable pair, while Vaughn and Fisher provide the necessary comedy. Walken is perfect for his role. A word of warning: if you had been secretly in love with elegant, charming Jane Seymore (particularly in ""Somewhere in time"") you could be heart-broken."

","A very funny and entertaining R rated comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediators who in their spare time like to crash weddings and meet chicks. They do it as a way to scam food, get laid, and basically to have loads of fun. This aspect is fun for the audience too, as we get an extended montage of our two friends crashing about 17 weddings and getting in all kinds of conquests, eating loads of food, and getting jiggy with it with many different cultures. But when the mother of all weddings comes around, they just have to go and try and do the ultimate con. Needless to say our two heroes get way more than they bargain for.<br/><br/>The wedding is being thrown by a Washington senator (Christopher Walken) and when Wilson first lays eyes on one of his daughters played by the pretty Rachel McAdams, it's love at first sight. When he learns that she is unavailable, he convinces Vaughn to stick around for some overtime so he can win her from her beau and soon both of them are in over their head. Vaugn's troubles only just begin when the other daughter can't keep her hands off him as well as the Senator's gay outcast son. Throw in a horny wife played by Jane Seymour and a psycho 90 year old toilet mouthed grandma.<br/><br/>There are some big laughs and most of the film works. My complaint is that this film is about 20 minutes too long and there is a big chunk towards the end that could have been taken out because the film seems to drone on for awhile at that point.

"jpschapira","7","0","0","10 December 2005"," The talent...
","It's only a matter of time that the supporting characters begin to shine and get their own movies. Agree or not, Owen Wilson was always the shadow of Ben Stiller. They have something in common; they always seem to be doing the same. But he started getting recognized for his charisma and some people thought he could carry a movie on his own; and ""The Big Bounce"" came <br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is a similar case; no, I'm lying, a different case. He is one of those actors who have always been talented, but time gave him a wider recognition. He had to be in some determined films so he could be now working as continuously as he does, and end up paired with guys like Owen Wilson, in films like ""Wedding Crashers"".<br/><br/>They make an excellent team. They are two types of comedians and the writers of the film (Steve Faber and Bob Fisher) created two types of characters (Wilson plays John, Vaughn plays Jeremy); two working friends that ""crash weddings"". That's the expression and what it implies is shown in the movie; extensively.<br/><br/>There's one scene where both of them go to the ""first wedding of the season"", and they cry on purpose, invent names to be part of the family; sticking their eyes on two women, so they can later gain them with cheap strategies that include dancing or being nice with children or grannies, to ultimately end up with them in bed.<br/><br/>After that first routine, loud music starts playing and the routine repeats itself a lot of times, with quick cuts and lots of different images, as if it was an extended trailer. It could be a waste of time, you could see it as a sign of laziness; but not if you understand that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it is made with dedication.<br/><br/>Director David Dobkin makes sure of keeping his characters and his comedic timing real. Therefore this is the most natural comedy I've seen in a long time, because there's not a trace of gross humor or bad taste in it. If there is, it is very subtle, because for once, there seems to be a little more of concern for the characters.<br/><br/>Consider John and Claire (Rachel McAdams), two sarcastic persons, not too serious about life; they click. But she is taken, by Zack (Bradley ""I always have the same hair cut, I always look the same"" Cooper), man from a wealthy family and loved by her father (a very classy Christopher Walken). However, after a series of events, John wakes up in the middle of the night and walks towards Claire's room and then goes back. Instantly, Claire can't sleep and she does the same thing.<br/><br/>Although is hard to believe inside the film, something's happening; and the movie is good because we think it can be possible. The cast spreads laughs all around. McAdams is beautiful as always and charming as ever, Vaughn is completely effortless and what I said about Wilson that, like Stiller (and I don't like it), he always does the same thingBut you know what? I love it! ""Wedding Crashers"" is a good contemporary comedy."

Top it with a great cast and two almost perfect leads and you really have a sleeper hit on your hands.<br/><br/>Or not. This movie could serve as a school example for how sloppy directing and editing can really work against the movie itself. There are so many scenes that really verge on being hilarious, yet they either end too suddenly or just stretch themselves too long so they lose all their oomph. Consider the opening wedding-crash montage - it just goes on and on. The freaking thing never ends. Or (not to say too much to avoid spoilers) the bondage scene - it's great, it's funny, yet it's seeping with wasted potential. I shouldn't even mention the surprise cameo that happens near the end - while I appreciate the work of the actor in question, his inclusion seems like an afterthought which serves nothing except unnecessarily prolonging the movie for extra 20 minutes.<br/><br/>I must admit that this IS a feel-good movie - you know the kind. It's a movie you have fun watching and you feel a sorta half-smile never leaving your face. Yet that smile rarely becomes a true laugh - you feel it coming, you know there something really funny right down the corner, yes, here it is...aaand, no, back to the half-smile again. And you'll be doing this right up to the ending credits (which in my opinion could really benefit from some goofs and screw-ups from the shooting itself - I was really eager to see some REAL Vaughn-Wilson interaction instead of a sloppily directed one).<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a good movie, an entertaining movie, a Hollywood comedy that is actually funny - which has become a rarity lately - yet don't go with very high expectations (which could be the case, especially after reading some of the raving reviews circulating here)."

","(I don't know if revealing a surprise cast member is considered a spoiler) ""Wedding Crashers"" isn't great cinema, but for what it is, I felt that I had gotten my $9 worth. The plot is not complicated. Two divorce mediators(Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson) who live in the DC area make a hobby of crashing weddings to take advantage of free food, free booze and most importantly, young women who dispense sexual favors freely. Predictably, Wilson's character falls hard for a girl at one especially posh event celebrating the nuptials of her sister. The girls are daughters of a Kerryesque senator played by Chritopher Walken. Vince Vaughan's character becomes entangled with a third sister.According to the credits, John McCain and James Carville have bit parts playing themselves, to add realism, I suppose. I missed them, and in any case realism is a term to use advisedly in a film where a little old lady cusses like a muleskinner, the senator's horny wife(Jane Seymour) traps Owen Wilson in a bedroom demanding he feel her newly-overhauled breasts, and Vince Vaughan's mentor, a silly character named Chaz Reingold(surprise cast member Will Farrell) is reduced to picking up babes at funerals. For the most part the ending is predictable, though there a few surprise turns. But since the movie is to some extent a romantic comedy, and they generally have happy endings, who cares? The controversial purple heart scene, if it's any consolation consistsofVince Vaughan merely showing Owen Wilson the medals for a few seconds and explaining how they will be used to get free drinks at a cash bar event. They don't actually show them being used, so we don't know if they are. Perhaps there existed such a scene and it was cut and will resurface when ""Wedding Crashers"" comes out on DVD. Owen Wilson's rival for the affections of the senator's daughterisn evil preppiemuch like generations of other preppies with no redeeming virtues in generations of earlier comedies. There are other parallels. In ""Caddyshack"" you have to accept a world of animatronic gophers. In this film you have to accept a man getting a handjob under a table(through his clothes yet) In one scene, one of John Beckwith's(Owen Wilson's) conquests,whose name he has forgotten, gets up from bed and asks ""Are you completely full of s--t or just half?"" His remorseful response is that he was hoping just half, but he doesn't know. That's kind of the way the whole film is, though there is a tipoff that true love may win out or at least be a contender in the opening scenes when the boys are dealing with a sniping couple(Dwight Yoakum and Rebecca DeMornay) who are fighting over frequent flier miles. I recommend this movie only with reservations for anybody under 16, and don't recommend it for children under 12 at all. There is nonstop filthy language, the aforementioned handjob and a bondagescene. And Owen Wilson gets beat up rather badly in a dirty fight. The nudity is brief, and mostly of girls. Very little of Wilson and Vaughan's flesh is seen. From their viewpoint, I suppose that this is one of the advantages of being the big stars that they now are."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Often with comedies, the trailer gives away all the funny parts. What is really sad is when the trailer is BETTER than the movie. Let me start by saying I am a huge Vince Vaughn fan. The man is funny and talented. So when he swings and misses, I will usually give him the benefit of doubt. We have come to expect more misses than hits from his cohort, Owen Wilson. To put it nicely, this is a miss. To put it bluntly, this is god-awful.<br/><br/>The premise is terrific! Couple of single guys BSing and charming their way to ""success"" at weddings of people they don't know. Problem is these guys seem old and cartoonish. Just can't believe very many women would fall for their ridiculous set-ups. Watching the scenes with Owen and Vince had me convinced they just rolled the camera and edited miles of film. Many of the scenes are choppy and abrupt. The soundtrack has a couple of the worst songs I have ever heard anywhere outside an elevator.<br/><br/>As far as the good stuff, Isla Fisher (""I Heart Huckabees"") is outstanding in her quirky role and Rachel McAdams (""The Notebook"" ""Mean Girls"") appears primed for stardom. She has quite the screen presence. Christopher Walken goes through the motions as the head of the Kennedy-esquire clan and Jane Seymour is downright awful as the drunk, miserable maternity figure. Will Ferrell (had to be him or Ben Stiller) has the predictable cameo as Chaz, the Wedding Crasher guru who has moved on to an even more despicable pastime. There is a semi-interesting early scene with Dwight Yoakum and Rebecca DeMorney, but no matter how hard I try, there is very little worth watching here."

","Best movie this year. Wow I am helpful. No really, it is hilarious. A little on the long side, but still totally worth it. Christopher Walken could've been more entertaining (his character was way too stiff throughout the film) but that was the only minor flaw I could find. Apparently Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn improvised most of the scenes. Pure genius. The chick from Mean Girls did an amazing job, too. One of my favorite parts is the awkward dinner scene when the grandmother starts being un-PC, and Vince's character is doing...fine. The entire theater was laughing nonstop and we even clapped at the end. Hands down my favorite of the ""frat pack"" films."

The movie knows what it is going for and does it well. All characters are just funny and none of them are trying to be funny they just are. The best part of this movie is that under the the funniness there is a really good story. You will feel for the characters and laugh as each ones own story get mixed with the stories of the other characters. This movie goes on to prove that Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson can make a bad movie funny and a good movie even better. This movie is a great time."

","For each of us who appreciate the AFI's 100 greatest films, there are those of us, myself included, that aren't afraid to show our love for the good 'ol character-driven, fish out of water, situational, buddy-buddy, flash a boob, sometimes-sophomoric, sometimes not, yet always flawless timing modern COMEDIES. That said, Wedding Crashers is a must... Not only to see, twice, but to get your friends to see, so that you can start doing what every Vince Vaughn and company vessel promises... The everlasting, Fletch-like ""when I can use this quote"" time of every day for the next six weeks. (Or if you hang out with my friends, six decades).<br/><br/>The film is full of them. But it's not just a bunch of jokes. This film holds up a pretty solid storyline yet doesn't make the same mistake most comedies do when most lose the laughs after the first act. This one had people rolling so hard in the second and third that sometimes we actually missed large chunks of dialogue that was probably even funnier than the ones we were still laughing about. The writing steered away (literally in the case of Owen's character NOT wrecking the yacht)from the ""easy"" joke choices and instead found the nooks and crannies to hide some of the best tricks in the book.<br/><br/>Delivery. Owen Wilson makes it looks effortless and fun. He always does. Same with Vince Vaughn.... Although always funny when he is the cocky fun-loving party guy, he is at his best when his character is frustrated, and his delivery of simple dialogue is so creative that I don't know who was going to blow a gasket, him or me. I honestly busted out laughing in the theater more than once. And that's a rarity these days. And Rachel? Rachel has a quality about her that makes you love her before she even said her first line. It's tough to stand out around this cast and she does so, very brightly. And what's not to love about Walken. He's the king of delivery. And the rest of the cast is right along with them every step of the way to round out the funniest movie I've seen this year.<br/><br/>I love the great dramatic pieces like everybody does. But let's not mix apples with grenades here. This movie may not win an Oscar for best picture, but it definitely earns respect as a solid, fun experience with a moral that doesn't beat you over the head. I believe it was GQ who tagged these comics (and the revolving crew of guys) as the modern-day Rat Pack... So enjoy it while it lasts. These guys are something special."
"Adrienne_Stall","Null","3","8","16 July 2005"," Wedding Crashers Review (actually focuses on the movie)
","This movie was in a word, eccentric. It started off very fast paced with scenes jumping from one to another. Rounding out to one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie. Here we are introduced to Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) and John (Owen Wilson). These two men have great chemistry together on screen not seen in a long time. These two together seem to bring out the best in each other and really push themselves to their limits. Which with that it gives the audience exactly what it wanted, a movie that may be the funniest movie in the past five years. Although most people will tell you this movie was near flawless, I did feel as though there was one major flaw in it. That flaw would be Rachel McAdams character. She did a fine job with playing the character, but the character in itself seemed flawed to be. It seemed as though throughout the entire movie her character was forcing herself to do everything. Whether it was talking to Owen's character or her boyfriend in the movie, it all seemed forced. Once again the scene-stealer was Vince Vaughn. Every scene that he was in was a smash. Every line that came from his mouth was hilarious and no one could have pulled off the character any better. He has every thing that made this movie work the way it did. And at the same time Owen Wilson was not his normal sarcastic, funny character in this movie has he had portrayed many times before. In fact he actually showed that he could actually act, even though it was not on a large scale of being serious it was much more than we normally see from him. And rounding out the main cast was newcomer to movies Isla Fisher. She is the exact counterpart to Vince Vaughn, with the way she gave her lines and the way she stole every scene that she was in. I would not be surprised if we were to see her many more roles. She was outstanding as the crazy, psychotic lover. The movie plot itself was a little flawed too. There were some scenes that I felt had no necessity to the story and were only thrown in to extend the movie's length. As I said before the movie started out very fast and funny. Towards the middle of the movie everything slowed down a lot and it started to focus more on the love interest between Owen Wilson's character and Rachel McAdams character. This part seemed as though they made this love story after the script had been written. I would have actually preferred not to see a love story and just let the movie be what it started out as, raunchy, wild, sex-filled humor. With the closing of the movie they even throw in a bit of a moral to go along with the love story. In the end the movie turned out to be better than what I had expected it to be. I found myself laughing at parts that I never imagined I would be laughing at. All in all it is a must see for those comedy fans that just want a good laugh.<br/><br/>Also there is a surprise actor that makes an appearance towards the end of the movie. I myself am not a fan of this surprise actor and did not like his work in this movie because I felt that he was thrown into the mix just for the fact that at this time and for the past year or so he has been a comedy mainstay. For everyone else beside me you will absolutely love the surprise actor and he will make you laugh harder than you ever have watching him before."

","Inane story about 2 jerks, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn who crash weddings to meet girls and have a good time. How do they manage to get in and mingle with the guests? How did they manage to make a movie like this?<br/><br/>At one wedding, the guys make such a good impression that they are invited to the country estate of Christopher Walken, who looks like a swollen nut-job in this one. Walken, a well-known economist, aspires to the presidency. Little does the public know what a dysfunctional family he has. A mother who curses and states that her grandson (totally off-the-wall) is a homosexual and that Eleanor Roosevelt was a lesbian. A wife, Jane Seymour, who tries in vain to impersonate Mrs. Robinson from ""The Graduate."" 2 flaky daughters and a vicious son-in-law to be round out this dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>Love does conquer all but everything comes the hard way.<br/><br/>The first wedding they crash is a Jewish one and it seems they have the most fun there. It's all downhill after that."

","Here's a question directed toward anyone who expects romantic comedies to be good...why in movies like this are the side romances more entertaining than the one we're supposed to be interested in? In WC, we are basically supposed to be falling in love with the romance between Rachel McAdams and Owen Wilson. However, about twenty minutes into this film I found myself caring more about what happened to Vaughn and Fisher's characters. She is FANTASTIC as a love-crazed little sister going after a ""cool"" guy. And Vaughn is great once he realizes that Fisher's character has been lying to him the whole time.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait to see what sweet little Gloria was going to do to Vaughn next. The desire to see their relationship develop blinded me from the whole rest of the movie until I found myself thinking, ""Oh yeah, we're supposed to be watching Wilson and McAdams."" I can't give this movie a good review because I would much rather have watched two hours of Vaughn and sex-crazed Fisher than anyone else in that movie."

Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn did amazing acting, I loved the combination!<br/><br/>This comedy movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen.

","The Wedding Crashers is a film that advertises two childish bozos crashing weddings and bagging hotties. It looks like a lot of fun. It's a shame it never quite lived up to that hype.<br/><br/>For 25 minutes the Wedding Crashers is just that. Two guys crashing weddings with preposterous, yet altogether amusing back stories about who they are, and why they are there. Fine. Then at one wedding John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) meets a girl named Claire. And after he meets her boyfriend, he knows that he must somehow woo her out of his arms, much to the chagrin of Jeremy (Vince Vaughn).<br/><br/>The characters grow consciences. Consciences? Why? I have no problem with sentiment in film. I loved Jerry Maguire and When Harry Met Sally. But if in American Pie Stifler turned around and said ""Actually this bozo clowning isn't for me, I'm going to get married and settle down instead"" you would be scoffing at the screen.<br/><br/>The rest of the film then plays out somewhat loosely like Meet The Parents, in which both men try to impress their ladies' father. Que stock characters galore; we meet the nasty boyfriend, the Grandma who says whatever's on her mind, the good hearted waiter and the gay son. And there are some hit and miss jokes along the way too (The funniest being at the dinner table).<br/><br/>Did I laugh? Yes. Was I glad I saw it? Well, yes. So no it's not a bad film. But I can't help but feel that I didn't watch the Wedding Crashers. I watched a much more schmaltzy and diluted film (the ending would make Frank Capra roll his eyes). But it IS funny. So I'm giving this one a marginal thumbs up, on the strength of it's jokes. Just a shame about the rest though."

","I have several friends -- educated ones, ones with quantifiably good taste -- who expressed bemusement at THE WEDDING CRASHERS (one went so far as to compare Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson to Hope and Crosby). I suppose I just didn't get it. Was this movie anything but predictable, often offensive (but not edgy) jokes and a banal plot with holes you could drive a Mack truck through? Nothing about the film makes much sense: Wilson and Vaughn's characters work closely together but never seem to communicate once a rift develops between them, for instance, without any kind of explanation; and the cheesy cameo if woefully out of place. It's all just part of the cinema of humiliation (MEET THE FOCKERS, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, etc.) that has foisted obnoxious and ridiculous situations on men just to make them writhe in discomfort. The only good thing about this movie is that it proves that the best Ben Stiller movie is one that doesn't have Ben Stiller in it."

","Uproariously hilarious and dominant over-achiever that is going to stand tall with the better films of 2005. Two divorce attorneys (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) take advantage of the summer season by literally going to weddings and posing as friends and/or relatives of total strangers to get access to red hot young women who have love on their minds. When they go to a wedding for the daughter of a popular politician (Christopher Walken), the Beavis & Butt-Head duo use their usual assets and antics to gain access to the high-class Maryland family's home. Wilson falls hard for one of Walken's daughters (Rachel McAdams of ""The Notebook"" fame who is engaged to super jerk Bradley Cooper) while Vaughn unwittingly becomes the one true love of Walken's youngest girl (a show-stopping, out of this world role for Isla Fisher). Wilson, falling in love for the first time in his life, does his best to stay as long as he can while Vaughn does everything in his power to get away from the demented Fisher. Wonderful turns abound by cameo actors and supporting performers (led by Jane Seymour, Henry Gibson, Keir O'Donnell and Ellen Albertini Dow) are right on target as the film uses strong momentum early and then when the story almost falls to plot resolutions late, a crazed twist keeps the entire project on its fast track. So many great moments (and super lovely ladies) make ""Wedding Crashers"" one of the most memorable and remarkable comedies of the last few years. 4 stars out of 5."

Will Ferrel's role seems a bit too grotesque for my tastes, but hey, there actually are characters like him in any college fraternity. I'm a comedy writer, myself, and I'm willing to bet that a great many of the scenes were based on real things that had happened to people the writer knew. Wedding Crashers is not just a parody; it's a social commentary on how too much partying and unbridled promiscuity will finally catch up with you.

He delivers his lines flawlessly and and really develops his character perfectly. Owen Wilson is a perfect complement and the rest of the cast does an awesome job as well. The movie is about 2 guys who crash weddings. They treat Wedding Season like an athlete would treat football season. They crash weddings to meet girls and have one-night stands without commitment. But forget about the plot because this movie is really about being hilarious. There is, of course, the obligatory love story and the ending is definitely satisfying, but by the time the ending gets there, you really won't care how it ends because you will have spent the previous 2 hours laughing so hard."

Billed as a raunchy comedy made for adults, what I got was mostly mildly amusing and sometimes downright boring. So many of the jokes went nowhere (see the ""call me Kitty-cat"" bit...too bad because it had potential). And what a waste of Jane Seymour. If you are going to cast a ""straight"" actress in a comedy role, take a page from ""Airplane"" and give her something hilariously over the top. As for Christopher Walken, again, if you're going to cast him, use him properly by taking advantage of his ""just-this-side-of-a-psycho"" persona. I don't blame the leads, Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson have a nice chemistry but they need to showcase it in a movie with a better script."

","This is a tough one to review. 'Wedding Crashers' has too many plot-driven scenes where no one acts in a remotely realistic way. But it's pretty funny (and, for once, the studio didn't wuss out and remove all the profanity & nudity). The unique talents of Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, and even co-star Owen Wilson are almost completely wasted. But co-star Vince Vaughn is hilarious and he steals his own movie (if that's possible). There are an equal number of bads & goods in this flick and director David Dobkin isn't creative enough to minimize the wrong ones while maximizing the right ones. But I laughed.<br/><br/>Unless you have a chemical aversion to the fast-talking ingenuity of Vince Vaughn, you'll LOL too. His scenes with Isla Fisher (a cute fling who becomes a comedic psycho) pile up and the story requirements rob us of seeing Vaughn do more zany things with buddy Wilson. The early scenes are great---with their clever scheme to bust in on weddings and score with lonely women at the reception---and I wanted more of that selfish hedonism. The two man-children are at their best when they're putting people on. The climax requires sincerity and it's handled nicely enough. Give me more of the ""I wish I had the guts to pull that stuff"" screwiness, though.<br/><br/>Wilson's scenes with young stunner Rachel McAdams carry the plot. He falls for her at her sister's wedding and gets himself & Vaughn invited to the family home for the rest of the weekend. They're cute together, but Vaughn is the charming rogue of this picture, humorously fending off advances from more than 1 member of McAdams' screwy family. Not even daddy Walken can maintain control of his kids. There should have been more wedding crashing in 'Wedding Crashers', although the movie certainly doesn't need to be any longer than it already is. The movie is flawed, but Vinny V in particular is a ton of fun."

Unfortunately the plot was rather predictable and did seem to drag out a little. However the film never took itself too seriously and as a result there were always bouts of humour just as things were all getting a bit much.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were great, i don't think there is any other way to put it, they were energetic and funny throughout. But also sincere when it mattered. Chris Walken was distinguished as always and played his part well. Rachel McAdams was, in my opinion a revelation, she completely drew me into the story, she was believable, lovable and 'real' in fact i think this film is probably worth a look just to watch her for a couple of hours! A very talented young actress.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable evening, with some solid acting, a predictable but lovable plot - a showcase not only for Vaugn and Wilson but for young Rachel McAdams too. 7/10"

In most comedies these days, the ads give away the best jokes. This one saves them for the film.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a fan of Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson but the supporting cast saves the film. Rachael McAdams steals every scene she is in and is worth the price of admission. Christopher Walken plays a role reminiscent of Meet the Parents. Artie Johnson looks the same as he did 25 years ago in Laugh-in.<br/><br/>I also appreciated that the film did not rely on doing the same jokes over and over.

","The few instances of actual humor in ""Wedding Crashers"" can't raise this film above cheap garbage. Owen Wilson is capable of some very good comedy at times, but is mostly lacking here. I don't care to castigate actors personally. But the belligerent persona of Vince Vaughn's character is a turn off for me. <br/><br/>I'm surprised that some actors would be part of something this crass and crude. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour can do very good comedy as well as serious acting. Apparently, most viewers don't see the denigrating attitude this film exudes toward women. The two male leads clearly are misogynists, seeing women just as sex objects.<br/><br/>This film is little more than a vulgar view of women. One hopes this type of claptrap isn't a sign of further degeneration of civilization."
"koyasu_kudou","7","2","6","13 January 2006"," Boring...
","This movie was so boring! I became angry during the first ten minutes because of the dull dialogue. I almost left the theatre but, decided to stick it out. And that's why I didn't give this film any less than a 7, because the middle of the movie was non-stop laughs. The end was just as lame as the beginning but, if you can bare all the bull just long enough to get to the good stuff then Wedding Crashers is worth seeing at least once. The two leading actors are personal favorites of mine and they manage to make even the stupidest jokes funny most of the time. Honestly, I wish I hadn't paid $9.25 to see it. It works better as a cheap rental for the weekend."
"Nineballgoddess","10","2","6","1 August 2005"," The role of Vince Vaughn's career
","Over the last 5 years or so, I've gone back and forth in my opinion of Vince Vaughn. My opinion of his characters in Zoolander and Old School was lukewarm, and Psycho was just AWFULLY CREEPY. But this is the role he was BORN to play! He and Owen Wilson are consistently funny from start to finish. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. There's a lot to be said about a movie in which Christopher Walken's character is the most normal one of the whole cast. That's a little frightening! No one in this movie is perfect; in fact, almost all of the characters have varying degrees of dysfunction. But they are lovable and dynamic and overall, believable. It was a little upsetting that Vaughn and Wilson are both in their late thirties, courting women who appear to be in their early twenties, but sometimes you have to just look the other way and let it be funny for funny's sake. (Turns out I'm wrong--the leading ladies are older than I thought. They just SEEM to be very young!)"
"cherbearaz","5","2","6","31 July 2005"," Barely worth buying a matinée ticket
","I paid $6.50 too much to see Wedding Crashers today, and all I got out of it was seeing a few haphazardly strewn funny moments thrown into 2 hours of screen time erroneously labeled as a ""movie"". The movie was long.... too long. There were only enough jokes to moderately cover the first 30 minutes, and that's being generous. <br/><br/>I typically like Owen Wilson, but I found him playing the straight man to be a huge disappointment as his character evolved into someone insipid, uninteresting and pathetic to watch. Vince Vaughn had a few memorable lines, again at the beginning, but nothing noteworthy or overly original. I found the supporting cast to be far more memorable than either of the leads, whose character names I honestly cannot remember because they were only mentioned a couple times. Aside from the character problems, the script is very disjointed and never really seems to come together. <br/><br/>It seems as though the ""boobfest"" was thrown in after the fact for the sole purpose of getting a male audience into a film that is better categorized as a quasi chick flick than a raunchy comedy. Or maybe just for increased publicity. It didn't seem to fit into the overall film, but then again nothing really seemed to fit. Disappointing doesn't begin to describe how I felt after all the hype. Better off as a rental."
"srsdvs","10","2","6","29 July 2005"," Vince Vaughn's Best
","As a comedy it is perfect. The movie could even stand as a romance, but as we know it is a comedy. The film is laugh out loud from beginning to end, and the film's best comedian is by far Vince Vaughn. Vince has now become the best of the Frat Pack taking that title from Ben Stiller. Owan Wilson was funny at times, but really the comedy belongs to Vaughn and all of the characters involving him. It was nice to see Christopher Walken in this film, but my favorite surprise casting goes to Will Farel whos character was mentioned throughout the entire film, but you never thought it was going to be Will Farrel. Will also delivers big time in this film, but Farel has yet to be truly successful as the main character. The film is sweet at times, and down right hilarious at other times. By far the best scene in the film is Vaughn's first night at he lake-side mansion. Other funny moments was the football game, the first table scene, and Chaz's (Will Farel) entrance into the story."
"jsmith31-1","6","2","6","28 July 2005"," Finally a solid comedy
","The 2000's thus far have been devoid of actual comic genius that deviated from the gag and gross-out joke. Wedding Crashers actually brings with it some interesting situational humor and witty rhetoric. It is a solid comedy and definitely worth a watch. Vaughn and Owen have a pretty well maintained chemistry throughout, with Vaughn's performance stealing the comedic edge by far and Owen performing well in the facets of both comedy and warming the heart. I personally could have done without the brother character, as that seemed to be the only superfluous storyline that didn't really fit well into the film. There's nothing completely unpredictable about the film, unless perhaps you count the one very good cameo performance, but predictability aside, it is thoroughly enjoyable and highly entertaining, and most definitely a step above the ""Dude Where's my Car""-esquire tripe that has been hitting the theaters lately."

Vince Vaughn really shines in this film. He is back to his Swinger's roots, and funnier than ever. There was not as much nudity as I expected, and what was shown was brief. The language was not too bad either. The humor is definitely more adult than juvenile. I had a mixed crowd with me, my 41 yr old sister, my 66 yr old mom, my 62 yr old uncle, my husband and a few friends. All of them absolutely loved it! I think anyone from 17-80 would love this film.

Wilson and Vaughn are the new Laurel and Hardy, they really make you laugh. the banter and chemistry between these guys are spot on. They deliver the laughs with utmost precision and when you least expect it they deliver again.<br/><br/>There are some romantic interludes, but that doesn't detract from the overall package.

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are hilarious as a couple of conniving wedding crashers who find they change as they experience true love. The cameos are priceless with Chistopher Walken, Will Ferrell and (no he's not dead) Henry Gibson. I think this will become a minor comedy classic much like Something About Mary. Vince Vaughn has become a comic force in the last few years. His tall stature makes him seem even funnier as he towers over most of the other actors in this film. There's nothing new here with the boyfriend you love to hate, and the girl we want to win over, but the cast carries it off well and you can almost feel the fun they have while filming the movie. This is not a film for children under 15, but the rest of your family will be talking about it over dinner."

","This movie was fantastic. I can not remember the last time a movie made me laugh so hard, so loud, so often. The only downside was that there were so many great lines it was hard to hear funny line after funny line because the whole theater was laughing so hard. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson had amazing chemistry, they are both hysterical in the film, Vaughn especially. But the movie would not have been complete without the flawless performances of the supporting cast. Chris Walken is always amazing, and Isla Fischer stole every scene. Comic curve balls are constantly being thrown and the laughs just keep coming. This movie was just fantastic. It is a great date movie. Guys and girls can enjoy the humor. There is also plenty of guy humor, and there is the romance aspect for the girls. It is a win win for everyone. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time and for anyone willing to laugh their ass off. Go see it!"
"firesign-2","10","2","6","16 July 2005"," Laugh out loud funny!
","Wedding Crashers was great! We decided to go see it on a whim, not having much information about it -- I think it was best that way, as many movies are spoiled by their best scenes being shown in the previews. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are perfectly paired as good-natured, bickering buddies with obvious affection for one another. I think it was a perfect casting for parts requiring a ton of dialogue.<br/><br/>The movie sets up the premise very well, making Wilson and Vaughn believable as best friends with a long history. Theirs is a very light-hearted, madcap existence and it's easy to relate to the experience of being at a wedding. When they get to the wedding that leads them through the rest of the movie, a great cast of characters is introduced. Rachel McAdams is bright, funny, and even speaking as a female you can't take your eyes off her. Christopher Walken, Jayne Seymour, Isla Fisher and Keir O'Donnell are instrumental in making the rest of her family the rich, crazy dysfunctional unit that it is. And the grandmother! Priceless. I think it is by design that you will hate McAdams' fiancé on sight. It's fun having someone to root against.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie you will probably find yourself rooting for Vaughn's and Wilson's characters, and they are ultimately the key to this being a funny movie. As men who are unafraid to express their feelings, they say a lot of things that men might think but would never say.<br/><br/>There are a lot of funny, if somewhat shocking, moments as this movie puts it all out there. Nothing is off-limits -- definitely not a movie for children, but a great date movie if you've been together with someone for a while. Probably not a great first date movie! It's also refreshing that the movie is not completely predictable -- for a comedy, there are abundant twists and turns, taking the story in directions you might not have thought of.<br/><br/>There will be some great memorable quotes from this movie. In all, it's funny, lovable and you will not have wasted your time or money to go see it!"

It won't have you laughing every other minute, but at least it isn't filled with boring periods of time often found in others of the genre. If you liked Meet The Parents, more than likely you'll like this one too.<br/><br/>One thing I'll add to this review is that the ten lines minimum rule is too long, I've said what I wanted to say.

","Wedding Crashers is better than the trailer shows it out to be, make you laugh quite a few times until the ending, but it stays less than superb.<br/><br/>2 career-successful bachelors have a habit of crashing in at weddings with fake identities to exploit the romantic mood of the best ladies and get lucky all season long. This recurs until one of them .... you know, falls into a marsh called love. The other gets stuck by a psychotic possessive nymph and both of them see their lives taking turn altogether while attending the US Treasury Secretary's daughter's wedding.<br/><br/>75% of the movie holds the humor well with occasional wisecracks and screw-ups. 25% was the sentimental part, which, oh well, had to be there if a guy has to convince his girlfriend to come watch the movie with him and not get beaten up badly later on.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn has finally hit it well with his comic talent. I did mention in a previous comment for Mr & Mrs. Smith than Vaughn should consider serious movies for better recognition, and still stand by that, but this movie will definitely boost up his value among casting directors at Hollywood. Vaughn can still play a sarcastic-fast talking lead in a serious movie. He definitely is no Harrison Ford but he can build a class of his own.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson, on the other hand, did an OK job. It was his character who fell in love in the movie and started changing the flow of the story around, but in my opinion could not match up with Vaughn's comic acting. I'll praise Wilson because he did ""try."" However, seeing Rachel McAdams in this movie has motivated me to watch another movie which I was actually least inclined to check out - the Notebook. The first time I saw McAdams on the big screen, like many may have, was a spoiled dirty blonde teenager in the Rob Schneider comedy ""The Hot Chick."" Thereafter she has starred in the Notebook and Mean Girls, won critical acclaim for her performance in the former and has won a role in the upcoming thriller ""Red Eye."" Not only is she pretty as a brunette, but also shows natural acting talents and ability to portray simplicity well.<br/><br/>Supporting cast by Christopher Walken and Will Ferrell (yes, he had to be there) was a well done job, and same's with the lesser known, yet very attractive ladies who played un-named bridesmaids throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Do watch the movie if you like comedy. Leave your brains and logical thinking aside for the 2 hours you will dedicate to this movie (and your companion if applicable). There are loose ends towards the end, and thats when you start waiting for the movie to finish. But until the loose-ends, you will enjoy the movie and laugh out loud!"

","I know some people thought that Anchorman and Old School were great movies, but I think they are overrated (though still funny).<br/><br/>I attended the sneak preview for Wedding Crashers Wednesday. The trailers made it look like the movie would be good for a few childish laughs, but I have to be honest, I didn't expect much. I was happily surprised. The last time I laughed this hard was the first time that I saw the original Meet the Parents in the theater. There were a couple of times I was literally in tears.<br/><br/>It's hard to go wrong with Vince OR Owen, and you have them BOTH!<br/><br/>As I was walking out of the theater, people were laughing and joking about the movie with their friends. One woman came up to me and told me, ""If you didn't think this was the funniest movie you've seen in a long time, then you were asleep!"""
"Luluhalabaloo","9","2","6","14 July 2005"," Two words: Vince Vaughn
","This is funny. Not in a stupid, teenage sort of way, but rather in a purely for adults way. The opening was priceless, with the audience gasping in laughter at Vince Vaughn's comments to the divorced couple, while seemingly relating to the scene itself (obviously, the majority of the audience had been through a divorce, it seemed). The film then oddly slows down to loud music and a frenzied tempo, and although I have never experienced that kind of weirdness, I am reading Hunter S. Thompson again so I can ""dig it"". It finally picked up, and from there, the fun lasted until the sappy beach scene which was a little nauseating, but I think we kind of needed a rest from laughing and straining to hear every word coming from Vince's mouth.<br/><br/>In an Benny Hill sort of way, it was campy too, which would appeal to those over 40. This makes the film so much more attractive to a middle aged group that is not baby boomer but early gen-x. Owen is a good straight man, but has his great straight comedic moments at the right time. Christopher Walken is in enough of the movie to satisfy me, and the bedroom scene, well, that was just...so...brilliant. <br/><br/>But Vince Vaughn, he was 6'5"" of hunk, a little meaner and more cynical than in Dodgeballand that's where the comedy really shone. My love of Will Ferrel has been replaced, finally and totally. Vince can deliver words so fast yet so clearly and also understand what he is saying! He doesn't ever break character,and he has superb timing.He doesn't look like he is having fun,he is serious,and takes his ""fun"" seriously in this film, which is so funny for Vince Vaughn. He stole every scene he was in, and his psycho girlfriend was an excellent match for him and when they interacted, it was magic. That bedroom scene, simply a classic. <br/><br/>Owen was cute, as always, with hints of his Zoolander character here and there. But to me, Will Ferrel really kind of surprised me. His character seemed old, or he looked old, actually, he looked like the ""Darrin"" in Bewitched! That's it! He didn't seem to really bring anything to the flick for me - he was grosser than his character in Anchorman (and I hated that movie), and really, his comedy was more of the teenage boy sort of stuff that the movie up till then really didn't portray. I was sick and tired of his physical stuff, but maybe I just didn't get that humour. I noticed that the laughter during his parts was deeper than otherwise, which means more men laughed than women. I loved him in Elf (""Does it have sugar in it? Then...YES!"") and many other things, he was my favourite for a long time, but, it seemed that this part was written in strictly for him and really wasn't necessary. It is almost scary that Will has already hit the ""cameo"" stage when he hadn't really peaked yet - I wonder if we will see great full-time work out of him ever now.<br/><br/>This is a comedy for adults, for men and women, for first dates, for group outings, and for those of us who grew up in the 70's and are still cool (or at least, WE think so...)."

"Studmeister004","10","2","6","11 July 2005"," Wedding Crashers
","This summer has been unusually humor-free, which is probably why the arrival of Wedding Crashers seems like a breath of fresh air. After being bombed, zapped, and gutted for the past few months, I have a sneaking suspicion that Wedding Crashers will deliver some much-needed mid-summer shenanigans for most moviegoers.<br/><br/>John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) love weddings. They don't mind getting dressed up, acting like courteous individuals, and shooting the breeze with people they don't even know. Oh no, John and Jeremy are in this deal for one reason: the bridesmaids. While the free food and drinks are nice, it is the allure of ending up in the sack with a horny bridesmaid that has them crashing weddings throughout the summer.<br/><br/>It's business-as-usual until the two attend a wedding in which the powerful Cleary family is present. John is immediately taken aback by the beauty of Claire (McAdams), an ordinary girl currently trapped in a relationship with Sack (Bradley Cooper), a domineering wannabe jock. Jeremy quickly hooks up with the younger Gloria (Fisher), a headcase who becomes a ""stage five clinger,"" according to Jeremy. Soon the two find themselves as guests of the Cleary household. Will they find true love and discontinue their shallow ways? Running an overly-long 119 minutes, the film loses a good deal of momentum in its third act, as the film frantically tries to tie up loose ends. It is here that we meet the ""king"" of wedding crashing, if you will, and it comes in the form of a quite unremarkable cameo by Will Ferrell. Some pitch black humor is introduced as well, none of which I found particularly amusing.<br/><br/>Regardless, Wedding Crashers is plenty rude and coarse, but many may be surprised its down-to-Earth moments. Teens will be pleased by the antics on display, but the thirty-something crowd may connect on a more personal level with the personality crossroads John and Jeremy experience as they walk the fine line between lovable and downright offensive. Instead of taking the easy route and simply making John and Jeremy caricatures that don't exist in known reality, screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher have crafted two individuals who may feel a bit too close to home for some of us.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn own this movie. Their interplay results in one of the best comedic duos in years, possibly since Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber. The funniest moments in the film are actually when they aren't trying. The subtle facial expressions, the reactions to the outrageous situations, and of course their coaction with the stone-cold Christopher Walken, who can make even the weakest of material float (see Envy if you don't believe me). Rachel McAdams plays off the two well and gives her character an identity instead of turning in a rudimentary ""look, I'm really cute!"" performance. Isla Fisher, who last appeared in David O. Russell's I Heart Huckabees, transforms into every guy's worst nightmare, and her shakedown scene with Vaughn is one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers will serve as a fantastic deviation from the serious fare in theaters at the moment. Those who are avid fans of Wilson and Vaughn are virtually guaranteed a good time, and the uninitiated viewer will certainly be amused. Groundbreaking humor it is not, but who needs that in a summer full of mass destruction and water leaks?"

Towards the second act of the film when Vaughn speaks more, that's when the film kicks into overdrive. Vaughn is put into these situations that just make your cringe and feel sorry for the big lug. What comes out of his mouth is just FUNNY. The things he said had me in stitches. Nobody in this film comes close... well, except maybe Isla Fisher, the crazy bridesmaid Vaughn falls for... She stole some scenes as well. Owen Wilson was OK, but most of his scenes during the first and second act are just OK. The third act is where his character arc starts getting really funny.

"RossRivero99","3","1","2","24 November 2014"," A comedic disappointment
","The purpose of all comedy movies is to make you laugh your head off so much that you are actually laughing with what the characters are doing, but that is not the case with David Dobkin's Wedding Crashers. The movie stars Owen Wilson as John Beckwith and Vince Vaughn as Jeremy Grey who are two men who belong in the wedding crashing business, but I have to give them credit for knowing how to get in and how to crash one. Before I watched this film I thought it was actually going to be funny throughout, but turns out I was mostly wrong because most of it was just humor with no humorous replies with laughs as this movie was expecting, I also thought that this movie in every scene was just going to be how they plan and crash weddings but in the scenes where John and Jeremy do so you just can't tell how they are doing because in advance all Jeremy says to John before they crash into a Jewish style wedding was""We have a bunch of weddings to crash"". Then a few weeks after that wedding they find out that that Treasury Secretary William Cleary's (played by Christopher Walken) daughter Christina (played by Jenny Alden) is about to get married to a guy named Trap (played by David Conrad). The only things that I noticed during the Secretary's daughter's wedding was the facial expressions (especially those by Walken). i really do think that the director to this movie David Dobkin could have done a much better job than what he did without thinking of revisions for his direction before the film was released. Then John ends up falling in love with one of the Secretary's daughter Claire (played by Rachel McAdams) when she already has a boyfriend with a sort of native American name Sack Lodge (played by Bradley Cooper) (What a huge coincidence that is, also when Sack doesn't even know about it). there was a lot of other things I hated about this movie besides the directing, I didn't like the story especially because it made fun of a time where we are supposed to feel good about ourselves and that is when someone gets married to the person who we think is the correct person to marry, the acting i would have to give half credit because in some scenes the acting was good as well as totally stupid/insane at the same time, the person who really does give the creepiest performance in this film as Isla Fisher (who also plays as one of Secretary Cleary's daughters) who plays a woman who is thought to be a virgin to some men when she is really a sex offender, and not only that there is also other people who gave horrible performances such as Will Ferrell as John's friend Chazz who end up crashing a funeral and Ferrell acts like a spoiled brat, Ellen Albetini Dow as the crazed grandmother who does act like the pessimistic octopus from the animated nickelodeon TV show Spongebob Squarepants, and by the way during the scene when John and Chazz were crashing the funeral I thought to myself ""What did this movie turn into? funeral crashers"", I also hated the script to the movie because of the fact that most of it was sexual garbage,and i especially hated Keir O' Donnell's performance as the only son in the Cleary family Todd who is a freakishly homosexual artist who tries to creep the heck out of Jeremy. What a dumb movie."

","I had this movie in my mental watchlist for a while. I decided to give it a look and it was just what I expected, and that is, an entertaining movie from start to end, laughs, nothing groundbreaking, some clichés here and there, and a good heart. Wedding Crashers is the kind of movie you can watch several times without getting bored, as I said, it's nothing groundbreaking, you can tell how is gonna end half way trough, and you can see clichés from the typical romantic comedies, but it's executed very very well that you fall for it. There's a lot of laughs and ""heart moments"", Owen and Vince have an amazing chemistry, hope I see them in more movies together. Conclusion: Go watch it, turn off you brain and enjoy."

","The perfect comedy. There is not much more to say than that. A very predictable plot, but it just adds to the cheerfulness of the movie. If you are an intellectual, this is not the movie for you! However, if you enjoy having a laugh with some friends, there should be nothing that prevents you from putting the DVD in the player and having a good time.<br/><br/>The cast is fun and Owen Wilson is always charming with his very characteristic acting. Whenever Vince and Owen work together, a fun movie is always guaranteed. They work together so well and all the fans of this movie wish there was a part two. <br/><br/>This is not a movie to be taken seriously. There should be no offense taken, as it really is just a fun comedy that everyone can enjoy. By that I mean, a few friends. This is not a family movie at all! There use of constant sexual content is not something that would go well with a family watching a movie.<br/><br/>It's also not a movie to watch until you are mature and understand the jokes they are making. If you can't understand them, you are really to young for this movie. However, all the people who understood the jokes either loved it or hated it! It's really one of those kinds of movies.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching it. It is one of my favorite movies and if you enjoy comedy, it will not disappoint. Enjoy!"

","Wedding Crashers<br/><br/>Well to say that I like Wedding Crashers would be a complete understatement. I truly believe with all of my heart that Wedding Crashers is the overall greatest movie ever made. I think it is one of the only true complete movies. Wedding Crashers has everything a great movie needs, comedy, action, romance, drama, absolutely everything. Wedding Crashers doesn't have a bad actor in the movie and it has Christopher Walken, enough said right there. The reason I love this movie so much is that Vince Vaughn is one of the funniest actors in Hollywood and he truly is a genius when it comes to comedies and romantic comedies. Also with Owen Wilson kind of being the right hand man to Vince makes the movie just gel because the two actors are so different. Rachael Macadam's is ridiculously gorgeous in the movie and really is very humorous in the movie. Wedding Crashers was Bradley Cooper's big breakout movie as a small antagonist role which got him huge roles in The Hangover and The A-Team. I really could write on and on about how much I loved every aspect of this movie but in every movie even the greatest movie ever made, there are some slight flaws. I would like to begin by saying I personally wouldn't have changed one thing in Wedding Crashers but I guess there are some slight things that I disliked about the movie. The worst thing I can think of about Wedding Crashers is that the character Gloria, the girl who has sex with Vince Vaughn's character is all over the place and is so immature at the beginning of the movie, and then she becomes some mature girl who ends up getting married. I'm not sure how to explain how I felt about all that but I just felt like the relationship between Gloria and Jeremy happened way to fast and I felt like it was kind of retarded the way they just got married and Gloria became so normal. Small situations like that made me question the writing but I really can't bash this movie and more then I just did. It's just way too good. There really isn't anything that comes close to Wedding Crashers but the one movie that I feel like tried to be as big as Wedding Crashers was The Hangover. Don't get me wrong The Hangover was a very big movie and I went to go see it at midnight and everything, it just didn't hold up to Wedding Crashers at all. It was a rookie cast of actors and it basically was a launch for a lot of the actors. I just didn't think that the crew that they got could carry a movie as well as Vince and Owen. Hangover did amazing in the box office I just felt from a movie critic stand point that Hangover seemed bush league compared to Wedding Crashers. Every line in Wedding Crashers is a one liner. Coming out of Hangover I barley remembers a one liner. I don't know I just am waiting for the day that a movie comes even close to the greatest film of all time, Wedding Crashers!"

","I watched wedding crashers last night, and I found it to be a very funny and entertaining comedy. The movie had many hilarious scenes and had a great plot. I've read many bad reviews about this movie, but they're mostly wrong. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn is great. They worked surprisingly really well together, and although I've really grown to dislike Vaughn, I found him to be hilarious in this, and actually thought that he portrayed his character very well. Wilson as usual was hysterical and nailed every line to the 'T'. Also towards the end, Will Ferrell makes a short appearance where he is actually funny (funeral crasher). Altogether I enjoyed this movie and found it to be very funny. Id recommend people to go see it."

"delwinchester","5","1","2","23 September 2008"," ""Wedding Crashers"" review
","My first intention when about to write this review was to deride the film completely; I felt it was overlong, the laughs were sporadic at best and the romance wasn't believable. Then I read the other reviewers comments and realised I needed to get over myself. The film is light fare, so when held up to intense scrutiny it will naturally appear weak. The film is perfectly enjoyable, and as many others have commented is carried by the two leads charm. When compared to its contemporaries in the same field I would say it is worth a watch.<br/><br/>Now, back to my boring and intense elaboration of the critical points I made at the beginning. Firstly, the length, I watched the uncorked version which came in at 128 minutes. I prefer my films, especially the lighters ones, to be short and sweet; I wouldn't mind the running time if there were more jokes and/or deeper characterisation. Which leads me on to the central romance; I just wasn't buying it. Even the ridiculousness of Jermey (Vince Vaughn) and Gloria's (Isla Fisher) relationship seemed more realistic than John (Owen Wilson) and Clare's (Rachel McAdams') boy meets girl, girl already has a boy cliché. Clare is painted as a strong modern woman; beautiful, intelligent, funny and career minded; however you never believe in her because she's with a man (Bradley Cooper) who is as evil and mean as a cartoon super villain. The supporting cast suffer similarly in the sense they are all weird but not all wonderful.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is OK, I just feel it could've benefited from a tighter script and better supporting characters."
"paul2001sw-1","7","1","2","21 March 2008"," Deceptively unoriginal
","The originality of 'Wedding Crashers' is conveyed by its title: a pair of young men gatecrash weddings (always full of strangers, so two more can easily pass unnoticed) in order to seduce women. But behind this premise, there's a plot that is a conventional replicate of a thousand other romantic comedies: everyone is beautiful, the class divide falls between the wealthy and the super-rich, sex is great but love is better, homosexuality is innately funny, the hero falls for the prettiest girl (in this case, the lovely Rachel McAdams) who rejects him in favour of her own wretched boyfriend owing to a misunderstanding but forgives him when he proves how much he loves her... a story both utterly unoriginal, and utterly unreal as well. So how much you like this film will probably depend mainly on how much you like its odd couple pairing of Vince Vaughn and Owne Wilson, both cast very much to type. Personally, I found the vision of unreconstructed maleness they projected a bit tiresome, not because of the characters in themselves, but because of the way they represent some kind of approved vision of how men are meant to be. There isn't any real insight into the innate nature of either sex here, to be frank; there are some laughs, but there are also times when you long for the film to go somewhere other than where you expect; and if that's how you feel, you'll still be longing when the credits roll by."

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","9","1","2","24 February 2008"," Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn 'crash,' the movie doesn't
","It's a recurring theme in movies: people break rules, but they do it to get things done in their own way and to get it done right. 'Wedding Crashers' is almost a parody of that recurring theme with John and Jeremy, two best friends who happen to be swingers, crash weddings in order to get at the many desirable single young women that attend them. To say that they get things done would be putting it lightly, because they do and do they ever!<br/><br/>The real interesting part begins when things don't go quite as planned at one wedding and John doesn't ""seal the deal"" before the end of the reception and might have real feelings for one of the girls. Jeremy sticks by him and they end up going to the weekend retreat of the family whose wedding they've ""crashed."" And that just happens to be the family of a high ranking political official. Thus there is a great conflict with John and Jeremy's hectic lifestyle and the strict law and order of Capitol Hill. And the cast makes it work wonderfully. John being confronted by the family's sexually repressed matriarch then being teased by Jeremy about it. Jeremy having a surprise visit at night from the family's eccentric son. It is all silly sex humor, but it is well done and, very importantly, not overdone. The humorous crux of the film does not lay on sex gags, but rather with our characters. No part of the film feels like they left it in just to have that joke at that moment.<br/><br/>The best part of the whole film is that it keeps this theme throughout. Even at the ending. Endings often seem rushed or contrived or unrealistically good and cheesy, here I found this ending to quite unlike that. I feared it might bring down the film by trying to be ""all good and happy"" and it is to a degree. However, there are several ups and downs that realistically set it up as such. Thus it is not contrived. Though it may seem a little rushed due to the fact that the second act of the film takes place during a few days, while the third act is much more stretched out with many leaps in time. But still, as 'Team America' told us, when you need to show that time has passed 'use a montage.' --- 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R for profanity and sexual content. Ages 13+"

","Indeed, so pale. This movie does not have a hint of intelligence, and so many call it remarkably funny-. But funny comedies are truly the ones that remain to the passing of time: no one will remember ""Wedding Crashers"" in 10 years for its ""un-aging"" script, but for its supernatural box office report. Owen Wilson is one of Hollywood's worst actor: try to think in any good role of him (or at least serious) Vince Vaughn talking fast and without mistakes? A pond in the screenwriter's continuity (if any). What is it with development of movies that the script has the same pattern everywhere? ""Supposedly"" funny introduction-Light Comedy-Corny Introduction of Love Story-Conflict with moral dilemma.<br/><br/>I didn't laugh at once, the characters are so mistaken for funny prototypes; the scenes are uncomfortable and painful. The script doesn't even exist. Nothing remembering good, warm movies or at least pseudo-intellectual like ""Matrix"". They don't have to be intellectual, but at least sharp like Shyamalan's twists, or stupidly hilarious like ""Scary Movie"" I didn't like the movie, because it didn't apply to my sense of humour. Maybe if you are in a sad streak, or you have a light laugh and a nice mood, you watch this and like it with a little bit of sympathy. Try, I disliked it. Besides: who is the director? Does he even exist? Dubkin? Did he survive WWII?"

","Java Man Reviews ""Wedding Crashers""(2005, R). Directed by David Dobkin. Written by Steve Faber & Bob Fisher. Starring Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher, Bradley Cooper & Jane Seymour. Running Time: 119 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com. <br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>John and Jeremy (Wilson and Vaughn) are Washington D.C. divorce counselors who spend their off-hours and vacation-breaks pursuing their real passion... wedding crashing. The rules of the game are simple: have a well-rehearsed explanation of how you are related to the bride or groom; be extra nice to the bridesmaids and other single women at the wedding; and never, NEVER fall in love with any of your conquests. Of course the One Big Rule of the movie comedy is to break such rules as soon as possible -- and sure enough, one of the guys falls in love. This happens when they crash the wedding of the daughter of Treasury Secretary Cleary (Walken), who has two other daughters (McAdams and Fisher) and a wayward wife (Seymour). Once our heroes enter the Kennedy-style Cleary compound, their cover stories begin to unravel and complications ensue.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 2.5 Java Mugs out of 4<br/><br/>It was 1962, and we had just finished stocking shelves on a Saturday night. ""C'mon, Terry, we're going to a wedding reception,"" said my coworker Ken Skelly. ""Whose?"" I asked. ""It doesn't matter,"" he answered. And off we went, two 18-year-old wedding crashing pioneers. I should have written a screenplay.<br/><br/>But a screenplay is just the beginning. What brings it to life is the imagination of the director and the talents of the actors. The talented actors we have: Wilson, Vaughn and Walken could recite the wording of a ballot issue and it would be hilarious. But somehow the film doesn't gel under Dobkin's direction. Walken for example, who normally chews up any movie he's in, seems subdued. And though Wilson and Vaughn have some sparkling moments together, their performances could have been more spontaneous. Some promising characters are left undeveloped. For example, Wilson and Seymour have a scene that echoes the great Mrs. Robinson seduction in The Graduate, but after that her character goes nowhere.<br/><br/>Though it could have been better, the film is still fun to watch. The production design is attractive as are McAdams and Fisher, who have the comic touch as the daughters. The editing, too, is well-executed, including a musical montage that takes us through a United Nations of ethnic weddings (Greek, Italian, Indian, Irish), and ends with some fancy moves on the dance floor that transition to fanciful moves in the bedroom.<br/><br/>Back in 1962, our wedding-crashing montage usually ended with us getting thrown out. But I would like to think that my old pal Ken perfected the technique and is still out there somewhere, crashing weddings and breaking hearts."

","Wedding Crashers had a great cast including Vince Vaughn (Dodgeball), Owen Wilson (Zoolander), and Will Ferrell (Anchorman). This movie centers around John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vaughn) who are wedding crashers hence the title. They go from wedding to wedding to meet girls to sleep with. But everything changes when they crash that wedding of the daughter of the US Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken). When they arrive at the wedding John sees one of the secretary's daughter Claire (Rachael McAdams) and falls in love with her. At the same time Jeremy meets the secretary's third daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher). Gloria becomes obsessed with Jeremy and he labels her as ""a stage 5 clinger."" when they are invited to the secretary's summer home John wants to go so he can try to steal Claire from her boyfriend Sack (Bradley Cooper). After that the movie only gets better from there with other great characters including the secretary's wife, Kathleen (Jane Seymour), his son Todd (Keir O'Donnell), Grandma Cleary (Ellen Albertini Dow), and Father O'Neil (Henry Gibson). <br/><br/>I have always been a huge fan of the frat pack movies but this is by far my favorite. In fact Wedding Crashers is my favorite movies of all time. This is the kind of movie that is so funny that you can't remember all of the funny parts because there are so many.

The unavoidable problems begin though when our team crashes too many weddings.<br/><br/>After a while, they start running into people at other weddings who saw them at the earlier ones. Then, they go to a high ranking government officials wedding (excellently acted by Christopher Walken). This wedding takes the wheel off our teams relationship & wedding crashing plans.

","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn sure know how to have fun. They seem to bounce off of each other with ease and pleasure, milking each scene for all it's worth. That pleasure is contagious in this movie, a buddy comedy that turns into a romantic comedy with a little bit of drama mixed in and a pinch of Will Ferrell to spice things up in the last act- all of which blends together quite nicely, which really is no surprise at all considering the talent involved.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Wilson are marriage counselors (how these characters ever got into this field of work is beyond me- beyond them too, probably) who spend a few months each year crashing weddings (i.e. attending weddings without invitation and singling out a young woman, one for each man, for a night of ""fun""; after all, women are more prone to give in to a charming man in light of the passions brought about by weddings, and the two men don't see any harm in taking advantage of this). Their characters, Jeremy Grey and John Beckwith respectively, are so serious about wedding crashing that they have a whole list of rules and a specific season in which they can crash. Unfortunately for the two of them, at a wedding late in the season, both of them end up involved with girls they can't seem to get away from.<br/><br/>And this is where the romantic comedy comes into play. Until this point, all the funny came from the banter back and forth between Wilson and Vaughn (who, by the way, should form their own improv duo), but Isla Fisher steals every scene she's in as a sex-obsessed daughter of a government official (Christopher Walken) who has her heart (and body) set on Jeremy. This is a case where going over the top was exactly what was needed, and Isla Fisher delivers with gusto. Rachel McAdams has a plainer and less flashy role as Fisher's sister and, coincidentally, the woman that steals Owen Wilson's heart right out from under him, but she, as usual, is still quite good. Will Ferrell makes a cameo appearance near the end as the man that invented wedding crashing, and his performance deserves to be seen for how terribly wrong it is and yet how funny it still manages to be.<br/><br/>The cast is better than the movie though, which is not an entirely bad thing. Instead of weighing us down with a deep message about the power of love and love conquering all, Wedding Crashers lets its actors run wild. Though it's not without its morals- it celebrates having fun and political incorrectness, but it also has an understanding of a person's limits and responsibilities to himself and those he cares about. But really, a movie like this is just a playground for the talent involved. And boy is it fun to watch them play."

","Maybe I'm just too old.<br/><br/>Maybe, being female, I don't find movies about cruising weddings for one night stands funny. I also don't find outrageous parodies of gay-artist-maniacs funny. The first 10-15 minutes are promising, but after that this 'film' gradually falls apart. Very uneven concepts with the heaving-breathing other maniac (Claire's finance) and her sister, the nympho-turned virtuous bride-to-be. Lots of bloopers and unexplained plot twists, like Vaughn miraculously escaping his bonds after being pinned down all night long (where did Gloria learn those naval knots?), and the finance's friend who managed to track down our heroes' wedding crashing mania despite their aliases and no background info. And when Claire is rescued during the wedding interruptus, why is everyone---priest, her finance, parents, guests, etc.--miraculously silent while Our Couple work out their problems? Oh well, I didn't like Meet The Parents either, a movie from which this film borrowed a great deal."

Owen Wilson put up a good solid performance and suited his character well.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher play their characters well especially Mc Adams who surprised me with her well played sexy and sweet natured character.

","This movie had more of a plot than I thought it would have. I was expecting a lot of raunchy humor like American Pie, but the jokes just weren't gross out ones. Two 30 year old guys get their kicks by crashing weddings during the summer. They do it for the food, boos, fun , and women. In the beginning, we see Jeremy and John attend a few weddings and see the tricks they pull to pick up women. Jeremy makes animal balloons and tells sob stories. Tehy try to cut the wedding cake and look like they belong before chatting up chicks.<br/><br/>Then they crash the wedding of a congressman's daughter. Jeremy nails one of the brides maids, another daughter, Gloria. She's all clingy and it freaks him out. John likes another daughter, Claire, but she has a boyfriend. Gloria invites Jeremy and John to the family retreat. Jeremy doesn't want to go because he's ready to ditch Gloria, but John insists they must go so he can get Claire. All throughout the film they recite the ""rules"" and John points out Rule # says never leave a fellow crasher behind.<br/><br/>The middle of the movie is at the retreat. A lot of laughs come from Claire's very competitive boyfriend and the family outcast, Todd. But the truth comes out about Jeremy and John lying. But things end up good for both guys in the end.<br/><br/>But what really makes this movie unbelievable is that John, who loves one night stands, would fall in love with Claire in a day and want to stop being a hound dog. I don't think so. But just get by that part and the movie is good.<br/><br/>Plus, Will Ferrell has a funny cameo as a legendary crasher.<br/><br/>FIANL VERDICT: Funny, entertaining."

","You know how they sometimes say a trailer doesn't do a film justice? Well, for Wedding Crashers, the opposite applies. The truly funniest parts are to be found in the teasersnot the movie.<br/><br/>Looking at the trailer, attempts were clearly made to advertise this as a raunchy sex-comedy. I am sad to say that it is not one, which is really quite a shame, since had it been, Wedding Crashers would have had at least something memorable to fall back on. Now it simply ends up being bland. The jokes are mostly unoriginal and unable to be saved by funnyman Vince Vaughn.<br/><br/>Now, the movie is not bad exactly, but it is beyond me how it managed to get so many MTV Movie Awards and gross so much money at the box office. Why do people like this so much? Why is Christopher Walken in such a mediocre and unfunny comedy? When will Rachel McAdams stop playing miss goody-two-shoes in the most predictable way? I have so many questions."

","I had an absolute blast at this movie.<br/><br/>However, after reading some other comments I am unsurprised that a minority of other viewers thought this was absolute drivel. The central premise, that a couple of toxically insincere and cynical guys can win over hordes of children, old folks, and beautiful women, is inherently offensive to some. If you can get over that and enjoy them for their candid banter and deep friendship with each other, enjoying the rest of the movie is a piece of cake.<br/><br/>Vaughn absolutely makes this movie hilarious while Wilson grounds it. The balance between them makes this a more Wilder-esquire comedy rather than the zanier Frat Pack offerings such as Zoolander and Anchorman. Granted a lot of outrageous stuff happens but the characters themselves are less cartoonish than in many other guy-oriented comedies. For me, that makes this film a better and more lasting opus.<br/><br/>The ""surprise appearance"" near the end of the film was funnier in theory than in practice, but I want to commend the actor who played the Evil Boyfriend of Rachel McAdams for his ultra-intense characterization. He may not have had much in the way of funny lines but he has just as much watchability factor as Vaughn and outclasses Wilson. Keep an eye out for him in the future.<br/><br/>With the exception of a dragged-out, overly serious denouement, this movie is TIGHT. As an example of true friendship I can think of few that can best it."

He would have to be, I suppose, because Owen Wilson can probably skate by on his looks. Their comedic chemistry was quite good most of the time. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour played fun parts and did them very well, just as one would expect. Isla Fisher chewed the scenery, and it looked delicious. Rachel McAdams was cute.

","This movie starts out reasonably promising, throwing out jokes at a rapid pace. But then suddenly 1/3 of the way through, it ceases to be funny. At all. And suddenly we're in the middle of a somewhat depressing drama that the writers and actors can't seem to dig themselves out of. Owen Wilson isn't amusing as a guy just barely hanging on to his sanity while feeling abandoned by his best friend, and that makes his character almost unbearable at moments. It's always a shame when writers think they need to inject something serious into what was meant to be shamelessly lightweight and this is a perfect example of how that can fail completely."

"BoyFromOz","8","1","2","12 January 2006"," An Almost Perfect Romantic Comedy
","In an age in which Hollywood has been lambasted for its lack of fresh new movies, the romantic comedy sub-genre has taken leaps and bounds (largely under the critical radar, but nevertheless vastly significant). In my opinion Wedding Crashers can be safely added to the cannon of recent smash successes. The film, which follows the dynamic journey of two wild wedding crashing bachelors (played with heavy dollops of charisma and chemistry by the incomparable comic team of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) as they wrestle with life's dilemmas and love. As aforementioned Vaughn and Wilson are spectacular, delivering nearly flawless, hilarious, yet emotional deep and touching performances. The supporting team is just as praiseworthy. Rachel McAdams who has proved her acting chops in pieces as varied as The Notebook, Mean Girls, and Red Eye once again shows off her inimitable charm as the extremely likable yet troubled Claire Cleary. Christopher Walken is brilliant as always in the role of Secretary of Treasury William Cleary and Jane Seymour, renown for the title role on the long running CBS drama Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, gives an inspired (however clichÃ©d) turn as Mrs. Cleary. Isla Fisher (Gloria) and Henry Gibson (Father O'Neill) round out a talented and quirky cast with Ellen Albertini Dow in a bit role as the Cleary's opinionated bigot of a grandmother.<br/><br/>The script, craftily penned by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher, works brilliantly as a comedy, but where the story really succeeds is in its poignant portrayal of human love and what that REALLY means. This is far more than just a ""sex comedy,"" as it may appear on the exterior, rather a laugh a minute, but touching journey with some of the most likable, yet flawed, characters you're likely to meet."
"lee_eisenberg","9","1","2","12 January 2006"," here comes the...something
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have frequently co-starred in the past few years, and now they can add ""The Wedding Crashers"" to that list. They play John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, who go to weddings so that they can have sex with the women there. But then everything gets out of hand when they follow one family home and John really starts getting attracted to the young woman.<br/><br/>I don't know how they did it, but they did it. There are a few lapses, but most of the movie is a hoot. Sometimes, you think to yourself ""Did I just see that?"" Believe me, you did.

This movie was real comedy, not just people tripping and falling and having incredibly awkward situations. The acting was great and Rachel McAdams brings the light to any movie.

Personally I think Owen and Vince are hilarious, and lately they've had some memorable comedic roles, which I thought were excellent, those were nothing compared to this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is the BEST comedy ever, it might as well be called the BEST movie ever. Why? It's got comedy, romance, a couple sad parts where you kinda pity people, oh did I mention that there's a lot of great lines as well.

One's totally ready for a relationship and the other one is, well...she's already in one. Will Owen and Vince get the daughter's to fall head-over-heels in love with them? To find out the answer I encourage everybody who loves a buddy movie, comedy movie, romantic flick to watch this movie.

Two best friends crash weddings to meet girls and end up finding the love of their lives. It's typical though that the theme was boy meet girl, boy lies to get girl, girl finds out the truth, girl hates boy, and in a very public setting boy confesses his feelings and girl falls for boy.

It's not one of those comedies where you love the two actors apart and then get nothing when they're together. The Vahgn/Wilson combination worked surprisingly well, making the movie even the funnier.<br/><br/>A few scenes seriously push the envelope, with dialogue as well as sex and nudity, but for the most part doesn't get too disgusting for most to bear. A great little chick-flick subplot that could be considered horribly written and corny if it wasn't for the laugh-out-loud comedy. Applause for Rachel McAdams as Wilson's love interest as well as Isla Fisher who pretty much steals every scene she appears in in a hilarious manner. Surprisingly touching and sweet towards the end, all females will fall instantly in love with Wilson's character. All males will fall in love with the humor. What a refreshing combination."
"gradyharp","3","1","2","5 January 2006"," Guess you have to be in the mood for this one...
","Comedies based on ideas and lines that play for laughs at the expense of other people's dignity have been increasingly flooding the cinema market in the past years. They usually tend to be summer blockbusters and because they make a lot of money and attract record crowds there must be need for them. Go figure.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediating wedding crashers whose chronic hobby is to womanize during women's most vulnerable hours (weddings) is the theme. The first half hour of this overly long (two hour) movie traces them through many a varied wedding circumstance where they prevaricate their way into people's acceptance, the reward being to bed the most gullible females present. Weddings have been used ad infinitum as theme parks for humor, some clever (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and others not. This one falls into the latter category as it takes a premise to extremes then shifts focus in the last half hour in an attempt to redeem itself.<br/><br/>There are some talented actors in the cast but few of them are given enough material to justify their inclusion. Jane Seymour in a Mrs. Robinson role has moments, but Christopher Walken as a government bigwig falters. A new face, Rachel McAdams, is welcome and acts as the only truly thought out character in the story. But you have to be in the mood for some cruelty of language, some toilet humor, and a tolerance for over-extended ideas to make it through this one. Grady Harp"

This movie has some very funny moments. Wilson and Vaughn make a good strong team. Not only were there numerous giggle points, but I had my head buried in my hands about 15 times throughout the movie in laughter. The dinner table scene easily tops that of the one in Meet the Parents.<br/><br/>The movie could've set out to do more than the whole ""get the girl"" scenario that has been done ad nauseum, but it's probably among the best attempts at the silly romantic/comedy. The violence isn't purely comedic. These tackles and punches really hurt and had me ""Oohhing"" (and saying other things, but those are R rated) in commiseration. However, some of the silly scenes (like the Will Ferrell shtick) don't really fly, and it sticks out like a big ol' sore thumb, but it leads to one of the biggest ""OH MY GOD"" moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Some people that are more politically correct than I might have problems with certain characters in the film. Whatever I say. The problem for me was that the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long. It could've done with some editing. If you go for this sort of comedy, as I do, that you'll like it.

"gavin-shaw","10","1","2","2 January 2006"," A fantastically funny tale
","Wedding crashers has got to be one of the absolute best films I have seen this year, it was comical but not verging on the stupid funny, it was romantic but not too slushy and most of all it displayed that not mater what you might like to think, no one is immune to love. Another great thing about this movie is that in my opinion it is completely unique, as I cannot think of another film that covers a similarly worked plot. In the film you have two guys who have been taught by a ""guru"", the ways of womanising beautiful young ladies in a matter of minutes, the main theory behind this is that women feel emotionally charged at a wedding, so John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vince Vaughn) spend most of their time at weddings winning a wonderful array of women's hearts, as juvenile fun. All of this belief in fun changes when John meets Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), at the wedding of the season, and he is immediately smitten by her, so whilst he is trying to get to her, Jeremy is busy seducing Gloria Cleary, and succeeding. John tries a large number of different tricks to get Claire to notice him, and to come to him, he eventually succeeds when Claire comes out onto the boat where John is talking to her father, from there on the is a visible spark between the two of them, which really ignites the rest of the film, this is also added to by the nastiness of Claire's current boyfriend Sack. From here on it really becomes a Romantic Comedy where Jeremy starts to fall for Gloria, as John falls out of favour with Claire, after both admitting to having feelings for one another. Eventually we get the fairytale ending we have been expecting since the guys and girls met, where Gloria and Jeremy are married, Sack gets floored by Jeremy and John gets Claire, they drive off into the distance happily ever after. Overall I think the ending although expected, came with the twist of the timing that it occurred, but this I think made it all the better. So I give this film 9/10"

","I am not usually one to enjoy slap-stick humor but this movie was undeniably funny. I think I may have laughed for a good 45 minutes straight at the ridiculous characters, the over-the-top scenarios, and the way that Wilson and Vaughn played off of each other.<br/><br/>I loved the beginning with scene after scene of Wilson and Vaughn at different weddings. What a bunch of total morons but it is so genuinely funny! But the best part is when they go to the family vacation house via boat. When Vaughn's character gets the sock by the crazy redhead and practically molested by the gay artist brother, I about peed my pants. It is too hilarious to explain. JUST WATCH IT!!"

","Alas! Behold a film that has rivaled the likes of Batman Begins at the box office and left several films (such as Fantastic Four) dead and bloody compared to it's rave reviews and amazing box office results. Now what would you say a comedy usually grosses? 50-60 million seems about the right amount, but this comedy (an R rated film no less!)has soared to 200 million bucks in the US alone. Now with such popularity you always have to wonder, is it that good? My answer for Wedding Crashers, yes.<br/><br/>We have two best friends who have known each other for many a year and crash weddings based on numerous rules left behind by a man named Chaz (Will Ferrel's brilliant cameo role). And what a pair they are. Vaughn and Wilson were born for they're parts. Each one play they're given roles with a unique and definitive personality, and pull off the jokes and situations with pitch perfect timing. Rachel McAdams is funny, charming, and so beautiful that it hurts the eyes. She plays the confused woman in love with great subtlety and care. and pulls it off beautifully, as does Owen Wilson as the confused man. Chris Walken does well enough, his character is not as thoroughly written, but he gets the job done. Isla Fisher is cute and fit for a strait jacket, as described. Will Ferell is absolutely hillairious as the king of crashing whom lives with his mother.All in all strong performances all around.<br/><br/>Writing! Here is the strongest point about this film. The dialog is absolutely perfect. The overall plot is above average. There are a few moments that aren't very believable, but it is very witty, raunchy and often unexpected or uncalled for. The writers handle the love story between John and Claire beautifully. It is so well played that you yourself feel slightly in love and confused. <br/><br/>Directing. Here is where I was a tad disappointed. Th director doesn't do badly, but he doesn't add much to it. The best thing WC's director does is his handle on they love between John and Claire. It is handled darkly and playfully. He does well with bringing the feelings onto the screen. Sadly, he doesn't add much quirkiness to the comedy, neither does he try that hard with the material. He unwittingly left massive portions of the comedic work to the stars, and does little with the laughs himself.<br/><br/>Final Grade: 9/10 A"

","There was a whole lotta fuss going on when this movie came out. People were saying that it is great, it's funny, it's excellent, I couldn't take it anymore I had to see this movie for myself. By the time I got in theater and walked out I was laughing so hard my eyes were tearing like crazy. ""Wedding Crashers"" is the best comedy of the year, next to ""40 Year Old Virgin"" of course.

"harrytrue","10","1","2","2 October 2005"," Good Movie
","A good movie. Some people say that it promotes the idea that behind every party animal is a responsible man who just needs the right woman. This is true for the two main characters, but there is another character who is still pursing girls, finding funerals are a better bet.<br/><br/>The two start out with a cynical attitude towards marriage, saying it's just to legitimize the sex drive, which our two heroes see no need to do. They later find out about love. To affirm a positive value, you must show a negative value.<br/><br/>Yes, there are homophobic comments, but again, you can only confront bad ideas when you show them. Todd no more represents all gay people then John and Jeremy represent all straights.<br/><br/>This movie shows the fine art of lying. It requires preparation. It realizes that most people will accept what you say. There is a great throw-away line, saying that they lost a lot of good men, and they don't want to talk about it. It changes the subject, and wins sympathy at the same time. However, a lie can be exposed if you dig enough, as happens here.<br/><br/>We all know about how it's the quiet ones you have to watch out for. Gloria is shown to be a bigger sex fiend than either of the men. In fact, when John talks about changing their relationship, she thinks about more kinky sex. He is talking about marriage.<br/><br/>Gloria is disturbed, but she doesn't like being used. ""Another notch in your belt"". Eventually, Jeremy realizes she's not perfect, but neither is he. He finds someone he's willing to sacrifice for. As John said ""We're shades of Gray"". Isn't that for most, if not all of us?<br/><br/>There have been movies about Joan of Arc. Gloria is a saint compared to that woman. Murder is not in her mind. Compared to Joan, Gloria is sane.<br/><br/>One positive note. In a lot of movies, fathers are shown as fools (Shakespeare did this too). In this movie, the father puts the happiness of his daughters first.<br/><br/>Some say that the idea of two guys crashing the Secretary of the Treasurys' daughters' wedding is unreal. So is Shakespeares' ""Twelfth Night"". Realism is what movies are to escape from.<br/><br/>One thing. This movie represents Americas' multicultural reality. They crash Irish, Jewish, Chinese, etc. weddings. Any wedding with food, booze, and horny girls."

","Quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. I am a huge Vince Vaughn fan and he was absolutely perfect in this role. Of course having Owen Wilson to play off of only made his brand of humor even better.<br/><br/>Owen and Vince are divorce arbitrators and work together. they are best friends who share a passion for what else, crashing weddings. I went into this movie thinking it would have some funny lines but they were already shown on the commercials, I was wrong. There are so many funny scenes in this movie that were not even hinted at in the trailers.<br/><br/>There are a few plot snafu's but they don't detract from the movie one iota.

"Angeneer","4","1","2","8 September 2005"," Don't believe the hype
","I fell into the trap of having high expectations for this movie, after seeing the overall ratings and considering some positive comments from friends (female friends, that was a huge mistake, never to be repeated, ever!). Well it seems they were dead wrong. The scenario is predictable at best. I know that this is never a strong point at a slapstick comedy, but they could use some half-wit dialogue. Script is dumb, period. Now the protagonists: I sympathise with them because they had to cope with some hopeless lines, but they could at least emit the aura of real charmers and womanisers. This was their job after all. What they achieved is to appear fake and badly cast. Especially Owen Wilson was seriously annoying. Obviously there will be no mention of the female characters, because they're just caricatures. Chris Walken is the only bearable actor in this movie and I completely understand that he's into this kind of flicks because he has a family. The only way to sit through the whole movie is to expect nothing at all. I guarantee it will match your expectations."
"diac228","7","1","2","6 September 2005"," Not an instant classic, but very, very funny.
","I never liked Owen Wilson. I think he is overrated, not funny, and usually just stinks up whatever film he is in, whether it is the already-bad I Spy or the well-done Shaghai movies with Jackie Chan. He was decent in the Meet the Parents movies, but because he had a small role. He is the main reason why I was not going to see this film. Plus, I knew nothing about Vince Vaughn at the time. After several weeks, several great reviews, and a ton of money and a ton of praise from audiences around the country, I finally decided to give it a try. This movie hands-down surprised me, I had no idea it was going to be this good. But, what ruins the film is what ruined Episode 3, made Fantastic 4 worse, and also what tainted Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. And also there was just too much Wilson, and certainly not enough Vaughn, who was certainly the funniest man in the movie.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is about two men who crash weddings to pick up women but their biggest challenge comes at one particular wedding in which Owen Wilson's character John falls in love, meanwhile Vince Vaughn's character Jeremy has trouble staying away from the latest person he made love to. What was supposed to be a one-wedding visit turned into a weekend stay with a popular secretary (Christopher Walken) and his not-so-normal family. Throughout the entire film, you see John try to woo the already-taken Claire (played by the beautiful Rachel McAdams) and you see Jeremy have trouble containing Gloria (Isla Fisher). The movie is just amazingly hilarious; I had no idea that it was going to be such a hoot. There are many reasons why the movie is funny, but there is one actor that steals the show, and that is Vince Vaughn.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn has the best one-liners, the funniest moments, the best reactions, and also is the liveliest person on the screen. While Wilson kind of slows the movie and Walken does not put much effort into acting during this film, you see Vaughn get tied in bed, eat like a maniac, confess in a most hysterical way, and curse his way into one of the funniest performances I have seen in a very long time. The last time I saw someone steal an already funny movie from the first minute to the last minute is Jim Carrey back in 1994 when Dumb and Dumber came out. His scene in the dinner table just had everyone almost on the floor in laughter; it was so crude yet funny at the same time. This movie scores because it does not try too hard to be rater ""R"", it embraces the rating, by throwing every curse word at the right time, by applying the nudity only at the correct moments, and by sneaking in some of the most crude humor in films nowadays just as the film shows signs of slowing down. It did not try too hard to pass the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>This movie was just doing so well for so long, and then decides to throw in some romantic elements into the film. What really makes me upset is when directors and writers try to add another element into the film, therefore making it worse than it should be. Action movies throwing drama (Transporter 2) or sci-fi action movies throwing pointless and pitiful romance (Star Wars: Episode 2) some films suffer from putting something else into the film that it really did not need. This movie did not need any romance or touching moments, throughout the first 80 minutes it was a fast-paced unpredictable comedy and during the last parts of the film it disintegrated into a slow-paced, sappy romance story that was literally saved by a spectacular cameo. Owen Wilson's depression just takes away the happy mood most of the audience felt throughout the first half of the film, and it just dragged, which is what kept this movie from being among the best comedies I have ever seen. At least the ending made up a bit for the sappy and pathetic moments. Maybe it was because I was watching it by myself, I don't know, but this film was going so well before slowing down almost to a halt. Nonetheless, this movie will make you laugh, and Vince Vaughn will catch your attention for sure, he truly surprised me.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Excellent movie, but its dragging towards the end keeps it away from being among the funniest of all time, with the likes of Meet the Parents, Dumb and Dumber, Airplane, the Naked Gun movies, and some of the classic Mel Brooks films (not in any order). Wilson was not funny, but his partner, Vaughn certainly was. Superb performances by the lead females and also excellent job by the writers, who managed to throw in a lot of funny and silly moments throughout the first half of the film. The cast obviously had a blast making this film, and you will have a blast watching it. Wedding Crashers: join the party.<br/><br/>7/10"

Of course you'll see noticeable plot twists, but it is a guy-wants-girl-but-can't-have-her comedy with shenanigans-a-plenty and quotes and quips that you'll be saying weeks after watching it.

"ExpendableMan","8","1","2","16 August 2005"," Hilarious frat pack comedy
","Given the level of success achieved by previous frat pack comedies like Old School, Dodgeball and Anchorman, it'd be easy to feel a little wary going into this film. Having provided us with so many comic moments that will surely be looked upon as classics in years to come, surely the time has come for Ben Stiller and his gang to deliver a dud amongst all the gems? Maybe it is, but 'Wedding Crashers' isn't it. In fact, this is one of the funniest offerings they've provided so far.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn take their turns at centre stage as two divorce mediators with cynical views of marriage that crash weddings in a bid to seduce girls already half-hypnotised by the romantic air. And their first on screen pairing together is tremendous fun to say the least. Wilson, normally accustomed to playing the dumb surfer dude is here a more realistic character; a hardcore but also intelligent party crasher questioning whether this sort of behaviour is befitting of someone his age. Watching his attempts to get together with Rachel MacAdams, a senator's daughter he has fallen in love with, he becomes hugely sympathetic despite his incredibly immature, roguish actions during the first thirty minutes.<br/><br/>Vaughn meanwhile is perfectly cast as Wilson's comic foil. His character is almost the exact opposite of the one he played in Dodgeball, the easy-going underdog charm replaced by a manic, motormouth lady killer. He spits out one liners so quickly, his rants on various aspects of relationships become increasingly difficult to keep up with and before you know it, you've missed many great lines simply because you're still laughing so hard at the other ones. Individually, the pair are both great actors, but together they provide a natural chemistry not unlike that of Laurel & Hardy, Wilson's laid back everyman charm perfectly offsetting Vaughn's misogynist arrogance.<br/><br/>The support from the rest of the cast has much to commend as well. Rachel MacAdams as Wilson's love interest is, to put it in it's most basic terms, stunning. She couldn't have put in a better performance as the senator's daughter and it's easy to see how Wilson could fall for her so easily. She is both intelligent, world wise and incredibly pretty as well, with the sort of smile that could light up a room.<br/><br/>Isla Fisher on the other hand offsets MacAdams much in the same way Vaughn offsets Wilson, the former Home And Away actress playing the demented younger sister that develops a crush on Vaughn and refuses to let go. She is at turns innocent and sweet, then deranged and perverse, yet handles all aspects of her character with ease and steals several scenes right out from under the other actor's noses. You have to give Fisher her dues that such an unrealistic persona could not only be entirely believable in her hands, but also very sympathetic and incredibly funny as well.<br/><br/>That isn't to say this film is perfect though. Christopher Walken remains an imposing presence, but never actually gets to do anything, despite early hints that he will clash with Vaughn in much the same way Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller collided in Meet The Parents. Plus, there is a third act cameo from Will Ferrell which promises much but delivers little, squeezing surprisingly few laughs out despite Ferrell's proved comic abilities.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, these are minor complaints in what is otherwise a riotously enjoyable comedy. There are no scenes as inherently stupid as Anchorman's newsreader gang war or Dodgeball's S&M uniform match, but the comic set pieces still deliver the goods and then some. One scene involving Vince Vaughn tied to a four poster bed and a potential homosexual rape from the senator's gay son is hysterically funny, whereas a football match in the first half is classic frat pack comedy. Despite the rapid succession of set pieces piled on top of each other though, there is still time for character development as well, Wilson and Vaughn's characters maturing as the film goes on and the end result is not only the most human comedy the frat pack have delivered thus far, but also one of the funniest as well."
"Danusha_Goska","7","1","2","15 August 2005"," Good, but Should Have Been Better
","""Wedding Crashers"" has some laugh-out-loud funny scenes.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn, as a hulking, earthy, wildman and Owen Wilson as a more thoughtful, cuter wildman, are winning and perfectly cast for the roles they play. Both charmed me, in different ways.<br/><br/>The premise -- sex-hungry playboys crash weddings in order to exploit women's sentimentality in order to have sex with them -- is really good, both goofy, for the sake of crazy movie scenes -- here are our boys pretending to be Jewish, Irish, and Chinese! and profound -- can casual sex be satisfying in the long haul? -- for the sake of a deeper theme.<br/><br/>I did laugh and smile and the naked breasts and obscene language that got so much play in the press didn't bug me too much.<br/><br/>It's just that, given the premise and stars of the caliber of Vaughn and Wilson, this movie could have really been a classic along the lines of ""Some Like It Hot,"" and it isn't.<br/><br/>There is some sloppy editing, with joke's set-ups obviously missing, and dead scenes that could have been deleted. There is some very flat-footed direction.<br/><br/>The writing is pretty slack in places.<br/><br/>And the female lead is a complete blank slate.<br/><br/>Why not cast a female star with as much charisma as Owen Wilson? Why cast a non-entity? Why not write her some good lines? Why not give her something to do? Why not provide Owen Wilson with SOME reason for falling in love with her? After all, in a classic like ""Some Like It Hot,"" Marilyn Monroe contributed as much to the film's impact as Jack Lemmon.<br/><br/>The movie's digs on women are often funny, but the filmmaker's inability to cast a strong female star or write for a female character is genuinely tragic, and weakened the film.<br/><br/>On a different topic: This movie is a treasure trove of clues about the Political Correctness Zeitgeist.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn, after being aggressively pursued by a woman he has picked up, refers to himself as a ""rape"" victim, and compares himself to ""Jody Foster in 'The Accused.'"" There is a scene where a very creepy gay man takes advantage of a straight man being tied up in bed, and tries to sexually violate him.<br/><br/>In spite of the movie's homophobia, the only true love in the movie is that between its two male leads, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson."
"meger_7","7","1","2","12 August 2005"," Humorous vows?
","Good concepts to certain films can go a long way and I think in the case of THE WEDDING CRASHERS, the concept itself sold the movie, at least to me. Sure, having Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson starring in it helps, but the concept alone seems like something original and funny, at least on the surface. But, comedies don't really need a thriving story line, just one that makes some sense, allowing openings for actors like Wilson and Vaughn to make people laugh. But, make no mistake about it, this duo of Wilson and Vaughn by no means compares to the classic THE BLUES BROTHERS pair of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, like some critics have voiced. As funny as these two guys are, comparing them to jokesters like Belushi and Aykroyd is jumping the gun a bit. Maybe after we see them in a more driven comedy, we can make comparisons, but for now they're just two funny guys with great chemistry that hopefully will make more movies together. And if those future movies are anything like THE WEDDING CRASHERS, we're all in for quite a treat, I think.<br/><br/>What happens when you get two divorce mediators/attorneys together at a wedding they were not invited to? Well, they crash it of course and that's exactly the premise behind this story of Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson), who crash weddings in their spare time to pick up women. Sure, crashing weddings to pick up women is low and borderline sleezy, but it's funny and that's really all that matters. But, all the fun and games seem to end when the duo crash the wedding of Treasury Secretary William Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter and wind up falling for two bridesmaids Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher), who were also sisters to the bride and daughters to the Secretary. But, falling in love is not part of the ""wedding crashing"" rules, so when John started to bend the rules a bit, Jeremy quickly got on his case, but the deed was done. John had already fallen for Claire and while he tried to figure out how to get closer to her, Jeremy was realizing just how nutty Claire's sister Gloria was, making up many of the stories hilarious parts. Between the two separate stories going on, you never had a chance to stop laughing, as John was able to be just as much the butt of a joke as Jeremy was, making up one heck of an ending that although predictable, was funny nonetheless.<br/><br/>You can't really get too deep into this film without giving credit to the cast, led of course by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The two make up quite a duo, combining two different styles of comedy, which is never a bad thing. Wilson's slow, methodical ways of being funny matched Vaughn's speedy delivery of jokes was truly something to watch. They definitely complimented each other, allowing each other to show off their talents and still be funny together when the time came. And to me, Vaughn made the film what it was with his nonchalant facial expressions, adding to his crazy stories or acts. But, Wilson is no slouch either, as he seems to keep churning out one funny movie after another, the last one being STARSKY AND HUTCH with fellow jokster Ben Stiller. Having said that, the pair had quite a supporting cast led by Christopher Walken, who on the surface might not seem funny, but can spit out some funny lines if you watch him. But, then there was Rachel McAdams (THE NOTEBOOK), who's character seemed to always bring the rest of the group back down to earth, which was great considering her on-screen sister Isla Fisher (I HEART HUCKABEES) was busy making Vince Vaughn look like a fool. There's even a cameo appearance that will sure draw some laughs worthy of $20 million dollars. But, overall this cast worked well together complimenting Wilson and Vaughn each step of the way.<br/><br/>THE WEDDING CRASHERS might not be up everyone's ally when it comes to comedies, but for those of us that enjoy watching actors make fools of themselves at the expense of good humor, this one is a keeper. With Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn leading a thriving cast of diverse talents, I can't imagine this film being any better. Sure there were a few parts that were a bit over the top and borderline sick, but that's the beauty of an R-rated comedy and one I would dub the best of the year thus far. So, even though this film might go too far for kids under 18 to watch, for those adults who still have a kid inside them, this one is for you.<br/><br/>B+"

Most women might not find it as funny as men, but that's OK guys, because ""The Wedding Crashers"" is also very chick-flick-enthusiast friendly. In fact, some parts are a little too sappy for my preference, but the extremely funny moments in between more than make up for it.

","When venturing into the theaters, I had expected Wedding Crashers to be a movie which compared to one such as ""American Pie."" As the story is unveiled to the audience, however, I knew the plot was much more intricate. The R rating can scare off many viewers though an occasional ""F-Bomb,"" mild nudity, and adult themes are not overused to disgust someone while watching.<br/><br/>The unique cast brings a new form of comedy to the viewer, as Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson both are spectacular in their roles. Someone who I am not familiar with, Rachel McAdams (Claire Cleary), did a magnificent job and handled her role perfectly. For anyone who does not know of this young actress, she will become a star very soon.<br/><br/>10/10"
"rparham","7","1","2","8 August 2005"," I'm ready to ""Crash"" this party
","Wedding Crashers is a throwback to comedy films that haven't been made with any regularity since the early 1980s: the sex comedy. I'm not referring to films full of innuendo or double entendres, but full on nudity and the raw language and outrageousness to back it up. For the most part, Wedding Crashers succeeds at creating a fun and funny romp, but it falls a little shy of being consistently hilarious.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is the story of John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughan), two mediators who spend every spring season crashing weddings together to pick up girls and have sex with them. These guys are two slick professionals who have been at this a long time and know all the ins and outs of Wedding Crashing: what to say, who to claim you are related to, what kind of spectacle to put on to get yourself in with the susceptible ladies. Jeremy discovers that upcoming is a major wedding for one of the daughters of Secretary of the Treasury Cleary (Christopher Walken). It is while crashing this wedding that John finds himself falling for one of the available daughters, Claire (Rachael McAdams), while Jeremy sets his sights on the other daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher), who turns into what Jeremy describes as a ""stage-5 clinger"" which basically means she has developed an infatuation for him that he is not interested in. When Gloria invites them back to the family grounds for a weekend of fun, John is determined to get Claire away from her uber-competitive and arrogant boyfriend Zach (Bradley Cooper) and describe his love to her.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is a film where most of the humor revolves around placing John and Jeremy in situations that force them to concoct elaborate lies and stories to keep themselves from being found out. Most of the film's best humor comes from Vince Vaughan, who is constantly playing fall guy to John's straight guy. Vince Vaughan is attacked by Zach during a family touch football game, sexually drained by Gloria in situations that rapidly explode in outrageousness, as well as the unwanted sexual advances of the Cleary son Todd (Keir O'Donnell), who is homosexual. Vaughan does a great job of portraying a man who's fun weekend of sexual debauchery is quickly descending into a nightmare. His terrifically cynical delivery is also perfect for the part.<br/><br/>Wilson on the other hand is given the role of the man who is growing tired of the endless strings of one-night stands and is looking for something more permanent. Wedding Crashers has a serious side to it, with the romantic angle of John and Claire discovering and exploring their mutual attraction. Wilson is capable in the part, but he doesn't make quite the impression Vaughan does after the film's early scenes. He has the somewhat thankless role of playing the straight man in a raunchy sex comedy when some of the audience is undoubtedly looking for more laughs instead of a growing serious streak to film. <br/><br/>On the female side of the equation, both Rachael McAdams and Isla Fisher are standouts. McAdams, who I had not seen in a film previously, has a great, easy charm and atmosphere about her that seems enormously genuine. She has a great smile and her line delivery doesn't feel the least bit forced or stock. She is a natural actress and I would love to see her in more films in the future. Fisher is also enormously memorable for her borderline insane Gloria. She plays the role of sexually awakened and starved Gloria with such verve as to believe it. Her scenes are a bit over-the-top, but they provide the film with some of it's best humor.<br/><br/>As mentioned previously, the film does meander into a more serious story towards the end and the humor drops off noticeably. This is a trend that has become common in many comedies in recent years, and I wish it would start subsiding. I don't mind serious films, but when I walk into a comedy, I am ready to laugh, and straight subplots that hijack the film have become all the more frequent and unnecessary. Bring me the unending humor any day.<br/><br/>Even so, Wedding Crashers is funny enough when it is funny as to garner a recommendation, and it is also good to see a film not afraid to push some limits that used to not be commonplace. If you are looking for a good laugh, Wedding Crashers is worth checking out."
"Kronos-8","5","1","2","9 August 2005"," Funny first half-hour
","You go to a summer comedy, you don't hold highbrow expectations. But hey, you can't get away with EVERYTHING. I mean, doesn't it have to at least adhere to its own established rules? The first half-hour of this one is fall-down funny. Wilson is subdued and Vaughn is manic, but they click. The wedding-crashing montage is funny, no doubt.<br/><br/>But once the main part of the film gets going, it all falls apart. Obvious jokes, well-worn and obvious, plot lines that go nowhere, and the odd feeling that much much more was shot and left on the cutting room floor. And yet, this one could use a really good editor.<br/><br/>Wait for the video."

John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey did an outstanding job. Hope they are awarded by their pears. The cinematography and phase-outs of the nude scenes were tastefully blended. I found the grandmother to be quite refreshing! She came across as spunky and alert. Jane Seymour was in great character as the ""Mother'.

","This movie has (almost) everything. A unique idea, well written for the most part, excellent acting on behalf of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan. Funny funny funny and then in the last quarter - absolutely no conclusion, no climax, no wit. The scene in the church is ridiculous and let the actors dangle in a soupy mixture of cheese and those really bad Goldie-Hawn-Style cheapos. The grim, ever so well introduced and portrayed character Secretary Cleary played by Walken suddenly looses ground and the plot falls apart. Execution here fails even the most subtle expectation. Was there no more money for a better written ending or no more time to edit two or three more scenes with a more appropriate finish? In any case, I give it a 10 for potential, but only a 5 for a very disappointing lack of confidence toward the end."

To be successful at this sort of venture, you must be good at making balloon animals, dancing with old ladies, and have the kind of metabolism that can handle catered food and cake every weekend.

"TheArgentWolf","7","1","2","31 July 2005"," Pretty good
","I didn't like Meet The Fockers, and was worried that it would be similar to that, but even though it was, it was funnier and more entertaining than that.<br/><br/>The movie centres around two men, John and Jeremy, who's hobby is going to weddings, and trying to hook up with various women. The plot was very strong and brilliant.<br/><br/>The problem is I found Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn's acting very dry, and not funny at all, though I'd say Owen Wilson was the better of the two. Who stood out for me the most was the excellent acting of Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher, who are both excellent actresses in their own right, and this movie only further proved that point. Bradley Cooper was brilliant, as there's always one person that you love to hate.

"Quicksand","7","1","2","25 July 2005"," Thank God this was R-Rated.
","Not a great film, it works because of the unusual situation(s) the leads find themselves in, and also the R-rated parts added back in, which are welcome. Hopefully this will remind Hollywood that there will always be an audience for R-rated material; naked women never go out of style.<br/><br/>The characterization is barely there-- Vince Vaughn steals the movie just by showing up, and Owen Wilson is fleshed out more by Vince's actions and lines than anything Wilson brings to the proceedings. Some other fun characters show up, but aren't fleshed out at all, even Vince's psycho-stalker gets one good character line at the end, when there was so much more to be said. The movie is paced and directed amateurishly, which is no huge surprise if you look at director David Dobkin's filmography.<br/><br/>If I wrote the movie, that would frustrate me to no end, but I only had to sit through it once, and it was adequate. Hopefully it's the re-emerging of its genre, but even if it's not, it was an okay time. Watch for an unbilled cameo, as well as Christopher Walken for no apparent reason. It's a movie-reviewer cliché to use the word ""radiant,"" but Rachel McAdams was radiant. And Jane Seymour is still hot. Nice."
"jmbagget","6","1","2","21 July 2005"," A Movie with some funny parts but not consistently funny . ""Spoilers""
","I came into this movie expecting a similar movie to Old School but I was disappointed with the outcome. First off, the movie started off like a preview because the story was poorly developed in the opening scene (not to mention that the whole plot was wrapped up in the first ten minutes meaning the plot was very weak) and immediately the audience was introduced to the two main characters crashing a wedding. From there, the movie was nonstop action of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn drinking and eating cake. I didn't understand it and it felt like my head was going round and round. I kept thinking when this chaos was going to end even though the first scene basically wrapped up the general plot, excluding the romance between the two main characters.<br/><br/>My second problem with the movie was how inconsistent the humor was. I have a problem with most of a movie being funny, and ridiculously silly and then suddenly, there is a transition to a serious moment and the audience is wondering where the hell humor went, or are we supposed to be laughing at this? The serious parts were corny, especially the parts depicting the boyfriend as a verbal abuser and a typical prick. I just got sick of the sentimental moments following a ridiculous moment such as Jeremy's moment with the gay brother or the whole part with Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>My last problem with the movie was Claire's boyfriend character. The character was one of the least innovative characters because every one of his actions was predictable. He just didn't add anything to the movie except a stupid excuse for Claire to fall in love with John.<br/><br/>It had many funny parts, but I wish the movie had used less serious, romantic parts and just had stuck with the humor."
"riderpridethemovie","7","1","2","17 July 2005"," Love, like movies, is about taking chances
","Caught between a 7 and an 8, I'm taking the lower number here just because the material here is so unchallenging for Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. I realize this is like saying Michael Jordan was too good, but in the movies, especially in romantic comedies, actors must take chances, otherwise there is no tension. Even in a silly picture there are plenty of opportunities to say something about the romantic condition, and while Wedding Crashers wants to say something, it ultimately chickens out, lest it offend the mostly married or coupled people who will buy tickets. It's a great premise with two brilliant comic actors. You will have a good time as the script is one gag after another. It's got Christopher Walken and a cameo by one of the Wilson/Vaughn clique that I won't give away because he truly is funny here. I'm sure every one will choose their favourite line or gag (Grandma calling Eleanor Roosevelt a rug muncher, the touch football game, etc.). But my main criticism here is that the little details are not tended to. For example, when the two leads have a falling out, why don't they see each other at work? Why include the scene when the boyfriend hires private investigators to find out who Vaughn and Wilson really are when it turns out it's the priest who rats Vaughn out and Wilson was ready to come clean with the Rachel McAdams character. Just because the filmmakers wink at clichés, does not mean they aren't still clichés. Why does the stock boyfriend character get so much screen time establishing him as evil when that was established just perfectly with the touch football game and his nauseating stories about scallops and sea otters. We get it, he's a dork  now back to the gags. For a movie called Wedding Crashers, too much time is spent away from both weddings and crashing. Story lines seem to be brought up and discarded (eg. the opening scene shows the two mediating a divorce, but their occupation is never brought up again; Rachel McAdams' family loves sailing, there is a short sailing scene, which turns into hunting. They never said anything about the family loving hunting. It's just an excuse for a lame ass gag). Vaugn and Wilson know better. They've been in Swingers and Bottle Rocket respectively, comedies that stayed true to their premise. That may have meant fewer kicks to the groin, but it made for superior movies."
"hotshots133","10","2","7","18 July 2005"," Wedding Crashers ruled!
","Wedding Crashers was an extremely hilarious movie from start to finish. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were absolutely great, as well as Rachel Mcadams and Christopher Walken. If you enjoy a good laugh, then I highly recommend this movie. Isla Fisher was also amazing at acting like a crazy clingy person. The whole Cleary family was highly dysfunctional which made the whole movie all the more entertaining. From the homophobic grandmother to the homosexual son it was a very odd and funny family. Will Ferrell's crazy role at the end made the movie way better than it already was and all the bad things that kept happening to Vince Vaughn throughout the movie were riotous. Again I highly recommend this movie! Trust me, wedding crashers is worth the 2 hours."
"forhall","10","2","7","16 July 2005"," You need to see this movie.
","I see perhaps 80-100 movies a year, and I have taken the time to write only one comment before, and that was three or four years ago. I watched the trailers for this movie, and I expected it to be mindless entertainment, kind of typical Owen Wilson-Vince Vaughn fare, expecting it to be a 5-6. When I got home and thought about it, I decided that 9-10 was more appropriate, and I hardly ever give a movie a 10. This time I did because of the (1) great performances of Vaughn, Rachel McAdams as Wilson's love interest, Isla Fisher as her sister, and Christoper Walken as the father of the sisters, and (2) and excellent, intelligent script.<br/><br/>I was really surprised. The actors in this movie must have had a ball making it because of a great script (R rated for language, but most kids have heard the words before), and the acting performances were all superb. This is, without a doubt, Vince Vaughn's best performance yet. Wilson is Wilson, but he has good lines and delivers them well. Walken is excellent, too. He's had a string of mediocre parts in the not to distant past, but this one allows him to shine, and it is the script and his deadpan way of delivering some lines in funny situations that make him better in this role, almost as good as Captain Koons in ""Pulp Ficton."" The truer test: The audience laughed heartily throughout, and the audience at this showing was, I would guess, an average age of 40."

The ""friendly"" ""touch"" football game was a riot. The dinner table scene with the grandma was great to, ""Elenor Roosevelt was dike, a carpet muncher"".

","I can't count the number of times water was flowing out of my eyes in this movie. It's a gem, and you need to go see it. It's not perfect, but it's quite brilliant all the same.<br/><br/>There are two things that are the strong point of this film. The first is the script. It's so funny, so sharp, that you're left thinking the screenwriters who wrote it are geniuses. One laugh right after the other, and you're not done laughing before another one comes along. People were laughing at different parts of the movie because they might not have catched the other one since the comedy was so rapid, just the way I like them. It'll give me something to look forward to on the DVD.<br/><br/>The other highlight was Vince Vaughn. This man is so brilliant. He's not always hilarious, but in this movie his timing was perfect, and his delivery is what really helped the movie move up a notch in the funny department, from hilarious, to classic. Give this man a script and he'll run with it.<br/><br/>The romantic element felt tacked on though, even though they set it up early on and everything from John's first lingering doubts about tricking women. I don't think Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams have a lot of chemistry, and I didn't see how they belonged together. I think that a movie that did this part better was Heartbreakers. This had better laughs, but that movie achieved a better balance between the comedy and the romance. At least for this girl.<br/><br/>That's disappointing because I like well-done romance in my movies. And that's what keeps this from being 10/10. The ending falls flat, and the dearth of rapid-fire jokes is very conspicuous, even though there are still quite a few left.<br/><br/>Be prepared to laugh your head off in the middle of the film and hear them come to a slow halt at the end."
"Hampden1990","6","2","8","25 July 2005"," really is ""The funniest film of the year so far""
","This film has everything you want in a comedy. Mainly due to fine performances from Wilson, Vaughn and show-stealer Isla Fisher this pushes all the right buttons. A laugh out loud classic. The storyline does borrow heavily from the likes of meet the Fochers and American Wedding but is more consistently funnier than both. Vaughn is on top form and this could possibly be his best role in years and stands out even if he at times is playing second fiddle to Wilson. There is lots of good back up (perhaps a little short) from big guns like Walken, Seymour and a certain Frat pack member who all benefit from the script spreading humour across all characters. In conclusion this is a fun film in a year where only dark films seem to be any good. This film needs to be seen."

I loved her in mean girls and I she's definitely gonna keep getting movie roles. But this movie would not have worked without Vince Vaughn, who is one of my favorite actors.

No jokes exactly. Just embarrassing circumstances and dialogue that feels like the writers just thought the actors could make anything sound funny no matter how blunt or unsubtle it is.<br/><br/>Pretty excruciating. The romantic interest is one dimensional and it's total insta-love. They poured on the schmaltz but invested no energy actually creating an interesting romance.<br/><br/>It's weirdly fascinating for its tone and one wonders if with different handling we could have had an amazing dark dramedy if only it could think of a real theme beyond the idea that people who want to have sex for it's own sake being awful for some reason.<br/><br/>I feel cheated."

","16 July 2005. Unlike ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998), ""The Wedding Crashers"" went over the line with its suggestive scenes, perhaps it's a generation gap, but the movie was a turn off in a number of respect. Owen Wilson's character was an insensitive jerk that provided no sympathy except for perhaps egotistical young adult males in the audience looking for some ideal rationalization why what they lust after is OK after all. This predicable, stereotypical comedy had great potential for a comedy-drama that ended up as male, summer entertainment for the exploitation of women. To its credit, ""The Wedding Crashers"" tries to be good with a morality tale that unfortunately got lost in the good feel movie entertainment. While a couple takes their vows the movie has a our main love interest being insultingly oblivious, just one example of how crass and insensitive this movie is. This uneven comedy promotes the most obvious offensive behavior instead of making this movie a witty, intelligent, comedy drama that it could have been. The script, the director took the easy way out scrambling for gag laughs that sometimes actually hurt (but not in a good way). Since the movie didn't degenerate into complete silliness and grossness five out of ten stars."

I also get tired of women being portrayed as having no brains at all and their worth directly measured by their physical beauty. This movie would have you believe that two professional men have no other way to socialize with women and enough spare time to research and crash weddings. They would also have you believe that there are lots of weddings with beautiful young women who have such little intelligence as to mistake the guys stupidity for charm and hop in the sack with him.

"Buddy-51","6","1","3","13 May 2006"," hit-and-miss comedy
","John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey have come up with a full-proof scheme to get women to sleep with them: they go to weddings of total strangers, pass themselves off as distant relatives of either the bride or the groom, charm the living daylights out of the other guests, then put the make on any pretty young thing that happens to come their way. And up till now, John and Jeremy have been able to pull off their little ruse pretty much without a hitch - until, that is, the day they decide to crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary of the United States. Then all hell breaks loose ""The Wedding Crashers"" is a comedy vehicle built for speed. The dialogue comes so fast and furious that it's occasionally hard to absorb everything the characters are saying. David Dobkin has followed suit in his direction, keeping the film going full-throttle at all points. That's the good news about ""The Wedding Crashers."" The bad news is that, as the movie goes on, the jokes and setups have a tendency to become a trifle strained, forced and labored, and the laughs begin to diminish as a result. It's not that there aren't some very funny moments in ""The Wedding Crashers,"" just that there aren't nearly as many as there should be.<br/><br/>As the two party crashers, Owen Wilson takes the role of the smooth-talking romantic lead, while Vince Vaughn gets to be the cynical victim of circumstances that such buddy comedies seem to require. Both are very good, but Vaughn, in particular, hits all the right notes as a man who finally meets his match with a girl (charmingly played by Isla Fisher) who has no intention of letting him get away from her after just a one night stand. Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, Rebecca De Mornay, Dwight Yoakam, Henry Gibson and Ellen Albertini Dow - who, apparently, needs to make an appearance in any movie that has the word ""wedding"" in its title - round out the cast. And, ah yes, there is a fairly large, albeit uncredited, cameo appearance by none other than Will Ferrell late in the film.<br/><br/>This is no bell-ringer of a comedy, to be sure, but it is at least harmless and watchable."

","This had all the potential to be a home-run buddy movie but it falls way short. I'm surprised that people gave it such a high average rating. <br/><br/>The character's non-stop babbling was way, over the top. I usually like Vince Vaughn's monologues but this may be like too much candy. We watched the ""unrated"" version on the DVD, versus the ""theatrical"" version so I can't say if it was any better. There is no way I could have watched it again to compare. Will Farrel's character was a nice introduction towards the end and helped me get to the end. I almost turned it off during the best man's monologue at the end, knowing it was almost over. It pegged the plausibility meter. For fear of being a spoiler, I'll say no more on that. <br/><br/>I blame the director for this movie missing the mark, not the actors. I'll continue to see any movie containing these two guys; just suggest you avoid this one."

","Take the first American Pie and put it in a wedding setting right away - no high school. Your result would probably be The Wedding Crashers, only with more character dilemma in the beginning. While The Wedding Crashers is a decent movie, the truth is once you get so far you don't really need to see anymore. It's actually a rather long movie for a comedy. Owen Wilson plays.... Owen Wilson (the same role I've seen him in in every movie he stars in). Vincent Vaugh does a good job, I'm happy to see him rise as an actor even though he does seem to play the same part on occasion. The story is one you've seen before, Wilson meets a girl, wants her, finds out she's taken, and then fights for her heart. I've seen this formula before, so there really weren't any surprises after that. If you like this kind of formula in a movie then you'll find yourself completely entertained but if you're like me and you'd like to see some new twists then just remember you won't find them here. Although it's still entertaining."
"blaircam","8","1","3","25 April 2006"," Modern Romantic Comedy
","Just watched this last night and I really enjoyed it. It manages to be something that is pretty rare, namely a romantic comedy that is both romantic and funny. Most romantic comedies go heavy on the romance and soft on the comedy (ie anything with Meg Ryan in it - the odd funny bit/moment - mostly about the every-girl eventually hooking up with the right man). This film is laugh-out-loud funny most of the way through. Its also a great buddy movie and has a great romantic plot line running through-out. The most surprising thing, however (at least for me) was the lovely Isla Fisher. I expected very little from her but she absolutely stole this movie from under her far more accomplished leads. She was cute, funny and utterly terrifying all at the same time. Nice to see a former Perth girl ripping it up. This is not sophisticated in any sense of the word but if you're looking for a light, fun watch this could be for you."
"spj-4","5","1","3","30 March 2006"," style before substance
","A predictable comedy that rates between 5 & 6 by my reckoning, though my pair of companions considered it more highly. As I watched it, I thought of what Hollywood was descending into, with mostly movies of special effects & no plot! FAR from the great era of movies of the era that Cecil B. De Mille & his ilk painstakingly engineering productions with MASSIVE contributions of their acting cast, hailed & famous, or unknown & mostly unappreciated in their seemingly trivial roles.<br/><br/>But of course, in a comedy of this type, there's no expectation or place for special effects & plot, for it is inane entertainment, made only for the night you have nothing to do. Take an actor imitating any number of Robert Redford performances & an imitation Meg Ryan, as partner in deception. Polish it with the worst of Americanism. Throw in an imitation Max Von Sydow & a cross between Arnold 'Terminator' seeking to present as a Billy Joel & other forgettable fraudulent performances like the horny would-be mother-in-law & you've got the underlying motive of supposedly popular appeal this offering seeks to inflict upon its viewers. Come to think of it, maybe I could have rated it below 5 out of 10. Nice settings & occasionally humorous contributions don't deserved this, but it's mostly messaged to be expected several minutes before it arrives.<br/><br/>Probably best watched when you have had a few wines or beers & are seeking a meaningless encounter with the world you are seeking to keep at bay, or when the movie is just to be a harmless diversion in appropriate company you wish to set an optimistic & romantic atmosphere for. Your relationship, however trivial, will surely be of greater substance than this. As such, you may not be disappointed."

","I just saw this movie last Sunday with my friend who came to visit me. It was hilarious!! I just recently moved to California about 30 days ago & rented Dodge Ball because my cable TV wasn't hooked up. That is the first time I'd ever heard of Vince Vaughn! I thought he was hilarious in that but THE WEDDING CRASHERS is EVEN BETTER!! I have ALWAYS loved Owen Wilson & think he's funny as hell. I need to see WEDDING CRASHERS again because there are so many great lines that you need to memorize & because there are so many of them you are laughing through them & can't remember them all after the show! This was a great film. Thanks Vince & Owen!"
"FMACDONALD","10","1","3","12 September 2005"," One of, if not my favorite comedy of all time
","Vince Vaughn is the greatest comedic actor ever. That's right I said it. I stand by my words too. Don't believe me? Go see Wedding Crashers and that should be prof enough for you. He's absolutely hysterical in Old School (The Animal House of the 21st century) funny as hell in Starsky & Hutch, and made me laugh my ass off in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Now once again he strikes gold in Wedding Crashers. The plot is a typical guy plot Vince Vaughn plays Jeremy Grey and his law partner Owen Wilson plays John Beckwith. John and Jeremy are wedding crashers. They show up at weddings they are never invited to, weddings for people they don't know just to meet women and have one night stands with. Jeremy lives for ""wedding season"", as he calls it while John is getting tired of it all. So when the crashers decide to crash the ultimate wedding, the wedding of Treasury Secretary William Clearly (Played by the always funny Christopher Walkin) John has it in his mind that this is going to be his wan song. The problem is John does the ultimate no-no. He meets Claire Rachel McAdams) and begins to fall in love with her. In the mean time Jeremy meets Gloria (Isla Fisher) and she falls in love with him. This is a big rule for Jeremy. Never fall in love with or get attached with your flings. John is so hard fallen for Claire that he convinces Jeremy to go back to the Secretary's house for a weekend getaway. There John runs into another problem. That problem being the Secretary's wife Kathleen Cleary (An extremely funny turn by Jane Seymour) who has the hot's for John. Wedding Crashers is just downright hysterical. I laughed so hard i was crying. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson make a great on screen duo. Owen Wilson in my opinion always needs somebody to work with. Whether that be Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, or Jackie Chan. The problem is I don't think Owen or his brother Luke can ever be leading men in film. Vaughn on the other hand can take a comedy and run to the hills with it. He steals the show in Wedding Crashers. What makes him great is I don't think he knows just how funny he actually is. He's so dry. Which goes to show you not everybody needs to be all crazy and zany like Jim Carrey to be funny. Vaughn is most likely himself in this movie and that just makes him funny as hell. Like I said see his previous work in Old School and Dodgeball and you'll understand. However if you want to see him at his best Wedding Crashers is the movie. For the longest time my favorite comedy was American Pie. Now American Pie has some serious competition. Wedding Crashers is not for every one though. There is some nudity but some people could get turned off by the language and the sexual content. The content is also a big part of what makes the film funny. Especially the scene at the dinner table in the Secretary's mansion. I was in tears I was laughing so hard. If you're in the mood for greast time with some raunchy laughs then Wedding Crashers is your movie. If not then wait for rental. Either way I guarantee you'll be laughing. On a scale of 10 i give Wedding Crashers a 10. Great movie. Best comedy of the summer. Now about The 40 Year Old Virgin......"

","It is good to see the crude movie back again and done as good as any of of them.This movie has good dialog some of the best I've heard,and Vaughn deliveries the lines as brilliant and funny as he always does i mean come on the man has one of the best deliveries in Hollywood.While Owen Wilson was just as good as he always is,i feel maybe picking the movie up a bit in the ending when it was getting slow one of the few times the movie had slow bits in it.Usually after about a hour and a half i get antsy in my seat but this movie had me laughing every 5 minutes and never bored me, kept me on the edge of my seat LAUGHING.Not to mention the women in the movie were awesome ,comically and nice on looks and Fisher is funny as heck ,Walken is good in it to but not as noticeable as Vaughn,Wilson,Fisher and Adams but his part wasn't as critical to the movie as there's but he was good as always.Also when my fiancÃ© goes to a movie a hr into the movie shes restless and when she heard it was a 2 hr movie she was worried but she laughed all the way through it and by the end she wasn't restless at all and enjoyed it being that long.Any movie that keeps her still and not complaining about how long it is by the end has my vote.The Wedding Crashers is a great summer comedy sleeper that will be placed on my top 10 comedy movie list and will be in my DVD collection release day.All in all a fun ,funny movie that will have you in stitches if you have a sense of humor and a funny bone in your body."

","Pretty much everything David Stratton and that old woman said about this movie is true. This movie is too long, the plot is somewhat jumbled, and sometimes there is no smoothness of location. The plot jerks around and moves from one idea to another. Some of the the actions of the characters seem imposed to fit in with the plot, such as when the Vince Vaugh character all of a sudden likes the crazy sister. Many of the comments from other reviewers about cheesy romance is true. The movie is punctuated by many humorous points, mainly at the beginning and towards the end. The third quarter of the movie is almost humorless.<br/><br/>This movie contains nudity, so keep that in mind before bringing the children.

"novella221","3","1","3","13 August 2005"," What was all the fuss about?
","I was very disappointed with this film. It was hyped WAY too much. Firstly, Vince Vaughn? we all know Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson make the best team and Ben Stiller is by far the funniest. Vince Vaughn looked awkward in this film and just didn't have much presence even if he is about 8ft tall!!!The first half hour of this film is very boring. We know it's a comedy but all the women falling for Vaughn and Wilson-who are they kidding? (They're not exactly Orlando Bloom!). Wilson then starts to fall for a girl who he meets at a wedding he crashed but as always she has a boyfriend who just so happens to be a thoughtless git who doesn't respect her. Well to cut the story short the film gets a bit cheesy. There are a few funny moments but not enough to make it a good film. It's a watchable film but I was expecting to be rolling around the floor in laughter when in fact it only just put a smile on my face on a few occasions. This film just doesn't work very well and Vaughn and Wilson don't show much comedic ability. It just wasn't funny enough!"
"MovieManMenzel","4","1","3","8 August 2005"," Over hyped, unfunny, and boring are all words that describe my feelings towards ""Wedding Crashers""
","""Wedding Crashers"" is about two guys John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) who basically sneak into weddings in order to meet girls and sleep with them. They do this for fun during wedding season. But at one wedding John actually falls in love with Claire (Rachel McAdams) which comes as a total surprise to him. Meanwhile Jeremy has also met a girl named Gloria (Isla Fisher) who is completely crazy. Together both John and Jeremy are on a wild ride to discover the unexpected surprises life brings and ultimately find out that maybe just maybe these wedding crashers could actually find true love.<br/><br/>This movie is an over hyped, lame, chick flick. I mean seriously why is any of this funny or original? I looked online to see what was funny about this film because seriously I chuckled three times. I asked myself where is this roar of laugher all the critics and people are talking about! It's not that funny at all. So according to people's comments online the funniest scenes are the following: One scene featuring one character getting off another character at a dinner table and another scene featuring Vince Vaughn's character being tied up on a bed and first being taken advantaged of by his girlfriend Gloria and then her gay brother coming into the room trying to rape him. Now those two scenes are considered the most funny scenes and to me neither were funny and to be honest, when I heard about the latter I thought I was going to be offended by it but I wasn't instead I was just shocked to see how dumb and stupid the joke was. The table scene I just mentioned wasn't funny at all because a. it was already done in ""American Wedding"" which wasn't funny either but instead of just jerking being involved there is also a blow-job involved as well and b. I am not a little horny or immature teenager who finds stuff like this funny. Also again Hollywood stop with the gay jokes! A grandmother calling her grandson a Homo is not funny at all! What is wrong with the IQ of America anymore? Why do we find these same jokes to be funny? I know this summer has been releasing a lot of crap but seriously people, don't say this movie is funny just because there isn't anything else to see or because it seems better then everything else out! <br/><br/>I am very disappointed with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in this movie. I usually like them but they just seemed to be so dull and one dimensional in this movie. Vince is actually getting typed cast now and that's never a good place to be. Also why is Will Ferrell popping up in movies all of a sudden making a stupid cameo appearance? That is really getting annoying; it's like Rob Schneider in Adam Sandler movies. Give me a break. Also Christopher Walken isn't used at all in this movie! The guy is great and they don't use him at all, why the hell cast him then? Also Rachael McAdams does nothing but smile in this movie; it was like OK Rachael do something.<br/><br/>The fault with this movie is the hype and the fact that all the jokes are targeted towards such an immature audience! It's such an average movie. It's very typical, predictable and has been done before. The jokes are already used and here are some examples: the dirty horny mom is from ""Slackers"" and ""American Pie"", the getting off at the dinner table scene is from ""American Wedding"" and a few other movies which I can't remember at the moment, the whole joke about being tied up and being taking advantage of is from ""EuroTrip"". Those were the funniest scenes to most, of coarse there were a few others but all in all most people only mentioned the scenes I just mentioned. The ending also is very lame and typical and by just watching the trailers and reading the plot outline you can figure out what's going to happen. Also the movie runs way too long it's almost two hours, and that's too long for a comedy. And finally this movie had some identity issues because at first it wanted to be a raunchy comedy but then turned into a chick flick. What the heck was up with that? <br/><br/>In conclusion, it's an average movie but because of the hype it now falls below average. I don't know what critics and audiences are watching but I didn't find this film funny. It has a few chuckles here and there but on the whole is very typical, dull and just drags on for its 119 minute running time. It's the perfect movie for horny teenagers or people who are immature. I love comedy movies, I really do. In fact it's my favorite genre of film but this movie didn't do anything for me. It was a total disappointment for me, especially with a cast that on the whole I usually enjoy. I guess if you found films like ""EuroTrip"", ""American Wedding"", and ""Slackers"" funny then I guess check this baby out. Also if you think ""Old School"" is the best movie ever then check out this movie. I liked ""Old School"" but again it was over hyped however that film is 10 times better then this movie at least it was funny and was more original. I really can't say much about ""Wedding Crashers"" that I did like except that most of the girls in this movie were hot but that doesn't sell a movie to me anymore.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Wedding Crashers"" is a 4/10."

There were several very subtle things that were done which really added to the humor.<br/><br/>The last 15 or so minutes almost ruined the movie with the long and unfunny Will Ferrell sequences which felt like they ran for hours.

It's nice, however, that the guys don't want to pick up beautiful, sexy women forever. They, like everyone (except for Will Ferrell's character, Chaz), want to settle down at some point, which was nicely shown in the movie. So it did have some depth.

Its a movie about having fun, friendship and love. Not only are there plenty of laughs stung throughout the entire film but this is a really great movie that makes you feel good. This film stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn which is a delightful duo to watch. It also stars Christopher Walkin who always delivers those lines just the way we like it, comical and very much Walkin. As actors they all feed off of each other and keep the laughs coming.

So if you're looking for some summer time fun this is it, you need not go any further, this is the movie you should see if you love to have fun in the theaters.

"eduardask","8","1","3","26 July 2005"," too predictable
","This movie falls under the trailer-movie criteria, which simply means, there isn't really much to see after you watch a trailer for it. a plot of the film is similar to ""alfie"" where this time its two guys instead of one are having simple fun crashing weddings in order to enjoy free food and seduce single women. at that point it only shows the easiness and the true way of how many guys do twist gullible women around their finger, making them believe they're unique, special and worth everyone of those blabber words that come out of their mouths. how much more naive can you really be?<br/><br/>After a while suddenly everything changes. John(Owen) finally realizes, the wrong way of life he's leading. that makes him change from a hardcore, boyish although still quite romantic player into a responsible, caring man who falls for a secretly(and sometimes not) boyfriend's abused girl(Claire). As a result the movie takes a sharp turn becoming truly romantic, chase after love comedy, while letting go of the careless way of life, imaginary childish principles and selfish hedonistic-way-Togo reality. Jeremy's way was a bit diverse, while starting at the same point he ended up falling for a crazy, disguisedly more mature girl, than from how she was exposed in the beginning of the film. His love though, was more sexually attractive and mystery oriented. <br/><br/>As an outcome, a movie has a pretty strong moral to it. Invisible is essential. We never want what we can get. this selfish based American freedom can only teach us to love ourselves and our egos. And what about appreciation, faith or love, which is way more difficult to achieve, cause it requires strong devotion, willpower and many sacrifices. very good flick for American public. although after reading more than a half of the comments, seems that people are concentrated more on the superficial stuff like stupid jokes or Jeremy's ball game abuse(which caused big laughter in the audience at the theater i attended). Acting on the comedy part was quite impressing. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson did a great job. Chris Walken-phenomenal. Isla Fisher- bulls eye. in the romantic part Owen Wilson and Rachael McAdams weren't that touchy as intended to be, but that was more likely the script itself, that couldn't create the expected tension in their affair. i give it 8 out of 10 for the plot, perfect cast and some humor."
"mattsox44","3","1","3","25 July 2005"," Very Funny but a little long
","This movie was flat out hysterical. It brought me back to the good old days before there was so called political correctness. This reminded of movies like Stripes, Trading Places, Vacation and Caddyshack. Great funny R-rated comedy. Some people have written that the movie is homophobic and unrealistic. These people need to lighten up - its a comedy and a straight man being hit on by a creepy gay guy while being tied to the bed is funny particularly when that straight guy is Vince Vaughn. The midnight rape/naked homo art show rant from Vaughn is hysterical along with the scene when they are hunting quail (I'm psyched!!! Let's go kills some birds). There are many other scenes that were also ridiculously funny.<br/><br/>Sure the movie did not make sense at times, but it is a comedy - just enjoy it. My only gripe was that the movie was too long.

","Parts of this movie are just great; other parts seem repetitive of lots of movies of this type. Many parts are laugh out loud and laugh hard. Other parts drag.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn is excellent, perhaps even better than that of Ben Stiller and Wilson, which is going some. Wilson's character seems the more typical, with Vaughn having more original bits to his character. As others have said, Vaughn's performance is not to be missed. The constant analysis of situations with reference to the ""rules"" is funny in part because of the truth contained in them and the perceptiveness of the characters, even though their goals are superficial.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great. It has been said before, but ""when Christopher Walken is the most sane character . . . ."" The younger sister and the brother are scene stealers. The interplay between the younger brother and the Vaughn is original and sidesplitting.<br/><br/>Overall lots of fun. Worth the price of admission. Vince Vaughn deserved lots of attention before, for comedy and drama. This movie will establish him as a comedic star to look forward to."

","Wedding Crashers follows the same formula that made hits out ""Dodgeball: A true underdog Story"", ""Old School"" and "" Starsky and Hutch"". It flows with fast paced humor, great comedic acting yet it has a predictable plot. But this rude and crude comedy brings you back to the classic days when comedies like ""Animal House"" ruled the box office. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn bring a strong presence to the silver screen, with Vaughn's motor mouth humor and Wilson's surfer guy comedy. This movie also has a great supporting cast like Rachel Mcadams, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymor and a few surprise guests. This film is worth every dollar."

There were a few very funny moments, so it's definitely a movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>The crowd I was with didn't seem to laugh as much as me though.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is by far the best part of this movie, though a lot of actors have funny bits.

"andrewlapointe","4","1","3","17 July 2005"," Promising then weak
","Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are two very talented and skilled comic actors. Everyone should obviously know this when walking into see ""Wedding Crashers"". Yet, this movie proves that great actors can make weak movies despite their greatest efforts. The actors try extremely hard and generate a few good laughs, but the screenplay is the biggest problem here.<br/><br/>The concept of two sly men crashing weddings in order to seduce women is funny and worthy material for a feature film. Unfortunately, after a promising setup with Vaughn's trademark deadpan demeanor and Wilson's dependable and likable presence, the script fails them fatally. After the first half of this overlong comedy, we're set into a predictable and tired story of the two crashers arriving at the wedding of a women who is the daughter of the U.S. Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken) They walk into the wedding sure of themselves, spouting off rules of wedding crashing to each other, and posing as very distant relatives in order to schmooze with the bridesmaids.<br/><br/>Wilson's character meets and quickly falls for Claire (Rachel McAdams) a sweet and smart sister-of-the-bride who is unfortunately dating a total jerk off who only serves the movie as a contrived plot point and an obviously forced obstacle to Wilson getting to her. Vaughn meanwhile meets and immediately has sex with her sister, a naive nymphomaniac who devotes herself completely to him. <br/><br/>The girls invite the two ""gentlemen"" over to their family's gigantic mansion for a weekend visit proceeding the wedding reception. The bulk of the movie takes place during this crazy weekend (which seems to last forever) where we have the awkward dinner scene, the cute bike ride in the country montage, terrible attempts at sex scenes, gay jokes, potty mouth granny jokes and the like. We even have the make-the-bad-guy-sick-to-his-stomach-by-spiking-his-wine bit.<br/><br/>The movie goes on for about two hours and within the time frame tries too hard to deliver laughs through lazy screen writing and old, corny romantic comedy formulas. Vaughn's performance is pitch perfect. Wilson carries himself very well. McAdams is wonderful and appealing. However, Walken is given such an underwritten and unfunny role that it's a real disappointment.<br/><br/>We do get some real laughs, not because they are well written bits, but because the actors deliver them hilariously. Will Ferrell makes an extended cameo towards the end of the film and it should be a saving grace, but ends up being something that should have dominated the film. It's the funniest thing in the movie, but you have to wait about an hour and forty five minutes for it. More focus is put onto the real lousy jokes, but the golden parts are few and far between. <br/><br/>""Wedding Crashers"" is full of real talent we've come to depend on. Vaughn and Wilson make a terrific duo, but their clout as excellent actors is no excuse to saddle them with a lame and inconsistent screenplay."
"jennifergriola","5","1","3","17 July 2005"," pretty funny, but the last half hour ruins it
","I really enjoyed the first hour plus of this movie, sure it wasn't very realistic, but it was quite funny. Wilson plays it more non-chalantly than Vaughn and the two are great together. The sex scenes weren't over-the-top and there was actually a decent plot (at least compared to what one would expect with the actors and subject matter). But the movie ""jumps the shark"" (I hate that phrase, I have no idea why I used it) in the last 25 minutes. Sure the ""surprise"" cast member scene is funny, but what follows is just strange. Then, the scene at the final wedding was odd and uncomfortable, definitely not at all realistic, it made me cringe. When a movie makes me cringe at the end it ruins the great vibe it had going for nearly and hour and a half and really leaves me disappointed, more so than a movie that never peaks to begin with. P.S. The movie was overly homophobic (not that any amount of homophobia is good)--to the point that I was embarrassed that the people around me were laughing so hard (this is 2005 for God's sake, not 1989)--for clarification purposes I'm not trying to push a ""gay agenda"" and am in fact an enlightened religious ""straight"" woman (only saying this because I think that some people think only gays and lesbians care about these things--NOT true)."

But what happens when one of these ""pimps with hearts of gold"" falls in love? A wonderful montage in the beginning of this laugh riot gives an insight to every con and deceiving line the two utilize in obtaining gorgeous bridesmaids. One of the most impressive parts to this film is how the actors' are so good at switching from slapstick vulgar comedy to sugar sweet drama queens. Rachael McAdams plays Claire Cleary, the beautiful daughter of Secretary of Treasury William Cleary (Christopher Walken). Her smile lights up the screen and she proves she can hold her ground with comic heavyweights like Wilson, Vaughn, and Walken.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn's name may appear second to Owen's on the marquee, but it is his portrayal of Jeremy Klein that will keep you rolling in the isle.

","This movie had potential (just like the stars in it) but it turned into an average romantic ""comedy."" The idea itself is pretty funny and Vince Vaughn plays his part well, so does Owen Wilson but what an abortion the ""faux"" engagement scene is. A blatant ripoff from ""Coming to America"" right down to the swing-set. These were two relatively likable characters who were doing unlikable things. Why did they need to find redemption in the form of love? That formula is so tiring. Also, it's official, Will Ferrel is no longer funny. I thought his scenes were painful.

After the first few minutes when the two ""heros"" push the boat out and say "" and use lots of other inuendo, one certainly hopes the boat develops a hole and sinks. And that was it.

"TorquemadaFan","10","1","4","17 February 2008"," Brilliant metaphor for US foreign policy
","Once again, a largely misunderstood movie that speaks wonders about the great nation of the United States. The liberals thought this was a sex-comedy about to promiscuous men who ""crash weddings"" by showing up uninvited. But it is actually a profound statement about American Politics and how we can use it to succeed in the world struggle.<br/><br/>First off, the film takes place in Washington DC, the nation's capital city which is not a coincidence. The protagonists of John and Jeremy are not just Americans, they are America! Move over Stephen Colbert. The opening sequences shows how our all American heroes go to various weddings of different cultural back grounds, but it is their American culture that makes the weddings exciting. They are at the center of each event just like the US is at the center of the World's most important political events that take place in different countries. And it is the US that sets things right and makes things end up like they should - with foreign cultures learning the American way of Liberty and Freedom.<br/><br/>But like all great studies this film is also very self-reflective as most of the action takes place in an American Families weekend retreat were one wedding just took place and another is in preparation. John and Jeremy boldly refuse the sexual advances of the promiscuous mother and homosexual son thus keeping their purity. I won't give the whole story away, but by the end they really shape that family up and help them make some very tough choices but in the end the American way is preserved. The closing shot on the Washington Monument confirms this: America Stands Tall and Proud. We go through our ups and downs, but we prevail.<br/><br/>Bravo to all involved in this cinematic masterpiece of metaphor and transcending ideas. They have truly created an ideologically sound film that was viewed by the largely liberal audience since it was a hit and retains a good rating here on IMDb. Let's just hope that they understood the right way."
"jboothmillard","3","1","4","30 January 2008"," Wedding Crashers
","Even before it started, I was dubious of this film, and to be honest, I was right, I should have watched a better film. Basically John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are business partners and lifelong friends who share a truly unique springtime hobby - crashing weddings. They basically pretend to know the bride or groom, or whatever ethnicity, watch the proceedings as if they were real guests, then at the reception manage to chat up some beautiful female guests with their clever back stories, and have their ways with them. Then the mother of all weddings comes along, the marriage of the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken) and wife Kathleen Cleary (Live and Let Die's Jane Seymour) is getting hitched. When they get into the wedding, they set their eyes on bridesmaids Claire (Mean Girls' Rachel McAdams) and Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher). Both have problems with their choices, John sees that she already has a boyfriend and fiancée-to-be, and Jeremy is with a virgin, but sex obsessed virgin! Jeremy is desperate to get out of the scheme, but John is obviously in love with his choice, so they have to stick around with the family so John can get her to fall for him, and Jeremy meanwhile has to suffer all the embarrassments of the family. They are eventually found out by the bastard boyfriend Zachary 'Sack' Lodge (Bradley Cooper) to be wedding crashers, but at the real wedding of Jeremy and Gloria (yes, he really did fall for her eventually), John expresses his feelings for Claire in front of the congregation, and gets William's blessing. Also starring Patch Adams and Road Trip's Ellen Albertini Dow as Grandma Mary Cleary, Henry Gibson as Father O'Neil, Ron Canada as Randolph, Keir O'Donnell as Todd Cleary and Will Ferrell as Chazz Reinhold. It had its very, very small interesting and giggly moments, such as Gloria masturbating Jeremy under the table while they have dinner, but's it's not a film I'd see more than once, i.e. never again. Adequate!"

","I loved this movie so much. Hands down one of the best movies of the year. Vince Vaughn was hilarious and Owen Wilson gave his best performance. Rachel McAdams gives one of her two memorable performances of summer '05. The other being Lisa Reisert in ""Red Eye"". Isla Fisher matches wit with Vaughn in giving the funniest performance in the movie. Chris Walken as always is great in his more of a multi-camio part. The movie has many memorable scenes that kept people talking...one of which involves a shot-gun, crazy brother, psycho grand-ma, delirious girlfriend and a cliché ending with a little ""kick"" to it. This is by far my favorite movie ever!"
"tomimt","7","1","4","26 May 2006"," Good comedy in its genre
","Wedding Crashers is, to be truthful, rather typical kind of comedy for its stars: it deals in sex jokes, situation comedy and overall idiocy. And that isn't a bad thing.<br/><br/>As it is typical for this genre, the beginning and the middle part are the funniest in this film. There are some milder, dramatic scenes, which of course are necessary from the plot point of view, but are in all rather standard love drama.<br/><br/>Cast does a good job in the film. Owen Wilson (John Beckwith) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy Grey) are funny as two juvenile friends, whose aim in life is to crash weddings in the hopes of getting laid. And they are very successful in that. But then comes the ""different"" wedding, where John falls head over heels for Claire (Rachel McAdams), the daughter of U.S. Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken).<br/><br/>'Wedding Crashers' is funnier than most of the comedies of its genre. Last comedy of this type I liked was the 'Anchorman' by Will Ferrel, who does a small role in this film too. So with that as a guide line I'll leave you to decide do you want to see this or not."

","First, a mild warning to those who automatically find all references to sex to be gross and offensive - this movie is full of those moments. It's a very funny movie, but just from reading these reviews I know that not everyone will appreciate it. So, be forewarned. <br/><br/>Likewise, for some of those thin-skinned folks - many of whom are probably veterans-groupies who might themselves never have served a day in uniform - who object to a 10-second scene in which the boys talk about using Purple Heart medals to impress women, my advice would be to calm down and just keep saying, ""It's only a movie."" As a retired military man myself I found absolutely nothing to object to. It's a movie!<br/><br/>As has been commented on elsewhere, this really is a ""guy movie"", but what's to prevent a woman from liking a guy movie? Nothing. A good laugh is a good laugh. Even though I'd never especially cared for Owen Wilson, and had never even heard of Vince Vaughn, I enjoyed them both in this flic. As has been pointed out over and over, they have very good chemistry together.<br/><br/>These two guys have only one goal: by attending weddings uninvited to eat as much free food, to drink as much free drink, to bed as many women, and to have as good a time as possible. Like it or not, this is almost the definition of young men! These two laugh, they spread good cheer, they hurt no one. These guys love life. <br/><br/>The writing is very good, the actors and actresses are superb. The laughs are there aplenty. So what's not to like? I recommend it highly. And this from a guy who will never see 60 again."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","4","30 July 2005"," Surprising Wedding
","A bud of mine, Tom, is a master juggler in his spare time. I remember he showed me how to juggle, and the one thing he always did was keep his eye on the ball. This is what Director David Dobkin, does with ""Wedding Crashers"", he keeps his eye on the ball or balls. Dobkin balances what appears to be an outrageous, laugh riot comedy that has something to offend everyone (really praise), with a touching and sweet romance. Dobkin diverts our attention, and surprisingly, the love story ends in the foreground. That being said, ""Wedding Crashers"" will make you laugh harder than any other movie release so far this year. The humor shoots beyond tasteless at times, and is flat out clever funny. Credit the smart and crisp writing of Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. Faber and Fisher transform what could have been ordinary and predictable, i.e. the goof ball guy ends up with the wonderful girl, and avoids the trite ending. Faber and Fisher grant the audience the satisfying pay-out. ""Wedding Crashers"" is also blessed with the genius comedic pairing of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn.<br/><br/>Wilson and Vaughn play John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, who are divorce mediators. Not attorneys. Mediators. Apparently, they are good at it. During the Wedding Season, they are master Wedding Crashers. They have found a brilliant way to eat great food, meet hot women, and get laid. John (Wilson) begins to question their vapid existence. Jeremy reminds him that one day when they're old they'll look back fondly at these days. John points out, ""We're not that young."" They decide to crash the Wedding of the Year. The daughter of Treasury Secretary Cleary (the perfectly cast Christopher Walken) is getting married. John and Jeremy do their research, and attend the wedding posing as investment bankers and distant nephews. Jeremy targets bridesmaid, Gloria Cleary (wild Isla Fisher). John is instantly entranced by her sister Claire Cleary (the amazing Rachel McAdams). During a funny exchange where John guesses wedding gifts, Claire asks John ""What do you think true love is?"" John replies ""True love is the soul's recognition of it's counterpoint, in another."" Claire admits that is ""cheesy"", and is touched. So was I, and completely taken off guard. ""Wedding Crashers"" is a great movie in that it does so many different things in context.<br/><br/>Needing more time with Claire, John convinces Jeremy to accept an invitation to the Cleary summer home. The Clearys are the poster dysfunctional family. Wife Kathleen Cleary (stunning Jane Seymour) making a pass at John, tells him that she and her husband were only faithful for the first 2 years of their marriage. Gloria (Fisher) is the entitled rich girl who had her ""Sweet Sixteen"" when she was thirteen. Now she is literally draining the life out of her new sex toy and love, Jeremy (Vaughn). Todd Cleary (Keir O'Donnell) is the misunderstood gay son, who is also attracted to Jeremy. Claire (McAdams) is perfect aside from having a vicious jerk-head boyfriend, Sack Lodge (well played by Bradley Cooper). The Lodge's are an esteemed family, and Sack is some sort of environmental warrior. Basically he is a world-class ass. John tells Claire, ""You don't realize that you deserve to be with someone great..."" The amazing thing in this context, John is not referring to himself.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an awesome and classic comedic team. This time around Wilson plays the straight man, John, who falls for Claire. Wilson has his funny lines, though mostly it's his laid back charm and cool that work. He also displays a believable vulnerability. Vaughn is outrageous and displays comic timing genius. His Jeremy even thinks quicker than he speaks. He is pure swagger and confidence. It is hysterical that he is initially terrified by Gloria. What really underpins this comedy and romance, amazingly is the depth and substance of their relationship. After a particularly bad night at the Cleary's Jeremy asks for some alone time from John. What could have been a flip exchange ends up being very understated and sweet. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and completely captivating. Her Claire is smart with a blind-spot (that being Sack), funny, with a great soul. She is John's counterpoint. It's great to see Jane Seymour. She is gorgeous. Her ""Mrs. Robinson"" scene with John (Wilson) is hot and hilarious. Christopher Walken is awesome as Secretary Cleary. He masterfully plays Cleary as self-absorbed on the surface, though he knows, and has unconditional love for his daughters.<br/><br/>See ""Wedding Crashers"". Really. It will make you laugh out loud and possibly offend. It will also charm you."
"jellyneckr","Null","1","4","15 July 2005"," The best comedy of the summer!
","The premise behind WEDDING CRASHERS is one that surprisingly has never been made into a movie before. Two guys (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to pick up chicks. It's such a simple and fun premise, which could have quickly got old fast had it been in the hands of the wrong director or screenwriters. Luckily, director David Dobkin and screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher proved to be just the right filmmakers for the job. That's not to say that WEDDING CRASHERS is perfect. It's far from it. What starts off as a throwback to such raunchy classic R-rated comedies such as ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY'S soon becomes entangled in becoming a romance where towards the end it becomes clichéd predictable, and overly long. Still, I'm giving it a high ranking due to the chemistry of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The duo of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in WEDDING CRASHERS is so inspired and brilliant it's amazing that no one thought of pairing them up before. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson go together like peanut butter and jelly. I would love to see them do another movie together. Hopefully WEDDING CRASHERS will be a big hit at the box office and there will be a re-teaming of the great duo. 7/10."

Hilarious, even, in parts.<br/><br/>Wilson and Vaughn play two guys who like to crash weddings--hence the title--and pick up tipsy, turned-on bridesmaids. They use fake names and back stories to make themselves more alluring, even going so far as to use fake tears to seem like they are moved at the ceremony.<br/><br/>The whole thing goes awry when Wilson becomes genuinely enamored of one of his targets and follows her to her family's New England island, an unwilling Vaughn in tow. The scenes on the island are funny, and the dinner sequence will have even intellectuals guffawing, especially the looks on Vaughn's face as his incredibly cute love interest ""passes the butter"" under the table.<br/><br/>Recommended. B.<br/><br/>Things to look for: Christopher Walken surveying Vaughn's fetters, gay son's painting, semi-clever allusions to ""The Graduate"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."""

","I've been alarmed by Wilson since his disastrous participation in the fiasco, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" but I have to admit he didn't really mess this one up nearly as badly as he's capable of. Vaughn put in a decent day's work as well, and the female performers were all very good. Add the always-on, now almost stereotypic performance of Walken and the cast overall can be rated as quite good.<br/><br/>The worst scenes of the film concern the main love story involving Wilson't character. I found myself almost completely uninterested in what happens to him during those scenes; whether he gets the girl or is killed by wild dogs would not have made a difference to me. On the other hand, the wedding scenes and the banquet scenes were well done and very entertaining.<br/><br/>This isn't ""Gone with the Wind"" and it isn't a film that'll be discussed in film classes next century, but it is fun to watch and will give you a positive feeling when it's all said and done. Look out for Jane Seymour as a nymphomanic upper-crust has-been trophy wife, look out for the good presentation of upper-class twits (big ears, big ego, inbred to the point of almost complete homozygosity etc.), look out for the Yoda-style, old-time-master appearance by Will Ferrel, and look out for late fees -- this isn't worth buying and it's not worth paying more than $1 to rent. 7/10; needs more profanity and more explosions to rate higher."

The best actors are under-used with the exception of Vaughn. If you watch many movies, you will probably feel like I did, and that is that I'd already seen it a hundred times before because it really follows that romantic comedy formula, the one where the good-hearted con man finally meets the woman of his dreams but he's been such a jerk that he has to clean up his act or come clean so he can woo her.

"trichardson-2","10","1","5","1 August 2005"," Funniest movie I have seen in a long time
","Vince Vaughn is his usual Double-Down Trent character. This is by far his best role. I never stopped laughing the entire movie. The dinner seen was the hardest I have ever laughed. The whole theater laughed the entire movie as well. I have already seen it twice and can not wait until it comes out on DVD. The seen with Chaz was great. I don't know what the other person is talking about in their review. She must of been watching another movie or has no sense of humor. The great thing about the movie is that this idea is brilliant and could easily be done. That's what makes the movie great. Sacks character is funny too because he is your typical boyfriend that everyone hates but everyone has a friend like that."
"chrono80776","9","1","5","31 July 2005"," Great Movie-Full of laughs-go see it
","Going in to this movie I was expecting a comedy along the lines of Anchorman or Old School. But for once a ""Rat Pack"" movie wasn't goofy or dumb but actually smart and funny at the same time. John Beckwith(Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey(Vince Vauhgn) are two buddies who together raid weddings just to get some action with hot beautiful women. They seem to have everything planed ahead of time. They go to maybe about 10 to 15 weddings in hopes of scoring. After the season is over they Go and rest when the subject of Secretary Cleary(Christopher Walken)having a wedding for her daughter and they both decide to go, but instead of just scoring, John(Owen) falls in love with a girl named Claire who unfortunately is taken, where Jeremy(Vince) on the other hand is dealing with Gloria who seems to be hyper at the thought of being with him. As a plot to win Claires heart Owen and Jeremy go to a nice little house where the crazy stuff starts flaring up from getting masturbated underneath a table to feeling a older woman's cans this movie has it all for a good laugh.....go see it."
"treep74","8","1","5","31 July 2005"," ....and hilarity ensues
","This movie is the latest from the group that has formed over the years of Stiller, Black, the Wilson Bros., Vaughn, and Ferrel. Some of the comedies that have sprung forth from this group have been excellent and the laughs provided have been well worth the ticket price (anchorman, old school), others .... well, not so much (envy, dodgeball). I am happy to report that this is one of the former. Sure, the plot is as predictable and clichéd as any Hollywood machine movie, but this comedy separates itself from those and from the other films from this troupe by being genuinely hilarious. The plot may be formulaic, but the jokes are not. Even in the greatest of the movies featuring these players the jokes have been expected and while funny, not enough to knock you on your ass (although funny enough to quote continuously for months following the initial viewing). This flick has that punch to its jokes and that is exactly what makes it so great. That is what separates it from other movie and that is to what it owes its success. The outline and the previews don't seem at all fresh, but the jokes are crisp. Plus any movie with Christopher Walken is good in my book."
"mzyznewsky","9","1","5","31 July 2005"," Best Comedy of the Year
","Wedding Crashers was sensational and a great slapstick comedy. 'Wedding Crashers' is about two sex-crazed best friends who invade weddings as fake family members in exchange for a one-night stand with beautiful women at the wedding (it's quite funny how none of these weddings they invade have guests lists). Anyway, their get-sex-quick plan is ruined when Owen Wilson's character falls for a women who already has a boyfriend, and a psychotic red-head falls for Vince Vaughn's character (who is not quite looking for love). Vince Vaughn + Owen Wilson make a great couple and it was great casting overall. Walken nailed his part and so did Isla Fisher. The film is loaded with gay jokes, which is ironic because Vince Vaughn's character shares various scenes with Owen Wilson's character in which they claim they love each other, which isn't exactly non-homo erotic. The stereotypes (especially of emo and gay kids) are what made this movie funny, along with a somewhat expected cameo from Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>9/10 for Wedding Crashers."
"rosscinema","5","1","5","28 July 2005"," Funny concept but horribly written
","The first 30 minutes or so of this film was so funny that it appeared that this was going to end up as one of the better comedies to come out in years...so what happened? The fault has to go primarily with the writers who lack the experience to keep up the wit for the entire length of a film because the last scene or two became almost unbearable to sit through. Story is about two best friends named John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) who when they aren't divorce mediators crash various weddings in order to score with vulnerable chicks.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** One ceremony that they end up crashing is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken) who is grooming himself to be President one day. This is where John meets Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) and falls head over heels in love but she's involved with a complete jerk named Sack Lodge (Bradley Cooper) who wants to marry Claire and align himself with the Cleary name.<br/><br/>This is directed by David Dobkin who worked with Owen before in the first ""Shanghai Knights"" film and also with Vaughn in ""Clay Pigeons"" and he seems to have the ability to handle comedies such as this with ease but it's a shame he couldn't do more to fix up an utterly predictable script. Both Steve Faber and Bob Fisher are responsible for writing this and you can all call me paranoid but I have a deep sense that the truly funny dialog that occurs when Owen and Vaughn speak to one another might be ad-libbed by the two. These are the best moments in the film and it's fun to watch these two because not only do we consider them funny but we know that they're best friends in real life and they (naturally) look comfortable shooting witty lines off of each other. I personally can't say for sure if this is true but It's hard to imagine that the same writers who have Owen giving one of those ""don't marry him...I think I love you"" speeches (at an altar yet!) are the same ones who wrote the dialog. I don't believe it! There were two other things that I did enjoy and the first was McAdams who continues to show that she's one of the brightest young actress's to come on the scene in the last few years and Jane Seymour who plays McAdams mother still shows that she's one of the sexiest ladies in both television and film. Someone get her in another sexy role (hopefully one that's more revealing) before it's too late. This film wants to be reminiscent of the raunchy comedies of the 70's and 80's but it fizzles out fairly quickly and ends just like the badly written romantic comedies of the last 10 years or so. This had an extremely promising concept but it becomes hopelessly predictable and even the usually reliable Walken is reduced to just staring when he should have had the opportunity to give one of his patented speeches."
"Madroxx","8","1","5","27 July 2005"," If you don't find this movie funny you might be DEAD!
","This was one of the surprise films of the summer. Vince Vaugh carries this film with his non stop, relentless on-point comedic performance. Vaughn spews so many memorable lines a second viewing is almost mandatory to catch all of them. Wedding Crahsers is quite possibly Vaughn's funniest performance since swingers. For those of you who find V Squared's unique style annoying might want to consider staying away from this film, but you would be missing something truly special. The film as a whole is a conventional romantic comedy that is brought to next level by Vaughn. However, Wedding Crashers is not without its faults, the movie does run a little long (about 2 hours)because of two not so funny montages in the film. Another problem I had with the film was how under used Christopher Walken was as the father of Wilson's love interest (Rachel McAdams). Excluding these few gripes and a fumbled cameo performance which could have been hilarious, the film was definitely worth the price of admission. So if you are a fan of some low brow humor in the vain of There's Something About Mary or Old School, you will dig Wedding Crashers. If the aforementioned movies don't appeal to you might want to skip this one."

Five minutes into the film I was already trying to memorize quotes to repeat to friends later, but by the end of the movie, doubled over in laughter, there were just too many great ones to remember! This movie is worth seeing more than once, it's even worth the exorbitant LA movie ticket price. Owen Wilson's cute, sheepish grin will keep the girls swooning, and Vince Vaughn's hilarious antics will turn tears of wedding joy into tears of laughter. Good for dates, good for the guys, good for the girls, this movie has it all. So much more fun that your average wedding--and with a key cameo from a certain Frat Pack favorite, you'll surely be clapping as the end credits roll."

","If you liked Swingers, Made, or Old School you will think Wedding Crashers is funnier than all three. This is Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn at there absolute best. Not only is it refreshingly an R rated movie, as all good comedies should be, but it has the best cast a comedy has had since Airplane! Rachel McAdams is to die for and Isla Fisher plays the role of the dirty younger sister, perfectly cast and cleverly written. Finally, the movie pays homage to past flicks such as The Accused, Cybill, and a great book The Dangerous Game--all are worthy of checking out if you are unfamiliar. The movie could've been 15 minutes shorter towards the end but it is still one of the funniest movies I've seen in years."

We see the ending coming a mile away but that's not why we love it. It's fresh, witty and utterly hilarious. While not as beat around the bush as Dodgeball or Anchorman, it delivers the raunchy and not so subtle humor that lacked in the other 2. This one didn't pull out any stops with the humor. There is nudity, language and utter humiliation. Owen is trying to be gentle with everyone and everything, but Vince gets a smackdown, ""raped"", shot at and body slammed. Don't miss it."

This is the vehicle which will truly let him shine. He is hilarious and shows what a genius he is at comedy. Owen Wilson isn't bad. I like him too but he's not Vince Vaughn. I thought that Vince's girlfriend in the movie was also awesome. Not only was she zany and kooky but she was very pretty.

","(Synopsis) John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are business partners and lifelong buddies. They are divorce mediators with a recreational hobby of crashing weddings to pickup chicks. They've been given a secret set of wedding crashing rules by Chaz (Will Ferrell) the guru of wedding crashing. John and Jeremy crash any and all weddings and pretend to be brothers working as venture capitalists or some other line of work. They are so charming that they are able to bluff their way through each wedding when relatives ask who they are. Each spots a beautiful woman and catches her eye. Eventually, each wins the chosen woman's heart, and then it's on to the next wedding! They never stay in the background, but actually get in all the action and pictures of the cutting of the cake, the carrying of the wedding couple, and dancing with the bride. They become a hit at each reception. The daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken) is getting married, and it will be the social event of the year. After crashing the wedding, John and Jeremy set their target on the two Cleary sisters, Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher). Jeremy is able to get close to Gloria, but John has Claire's boyfriend to contend with. John and Jeremy are able to get invited to a weekend party at the Cleary family estate, where they learn a few lessons about love.<br/><br/>(Comment) The movie is hilarious from the beginning to the very end. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are naturals when performing their verbal and slapstick comedy. There are several scenes that may make you bust a gut laughing. This movie will help single men by revealing some of the rules and giving them a few pointers on how to pickup women. The moral to the story is that you can find happiness at a wedding, especially if it is not your own. This is one chick-flick you must see. (New Line Cinema, Run time 1:55, Rated R)(8/10)"

A lot! Owen Wilson is his usual adorable self, but Vince Vaughn has really perfected his big lovable crud ball. And the girls are not only pretty, they are hysterically funny as well. But it isn't just ""Porky's"" type humor---many of the characters are worthy of induction into the weirdo-funny Hall of Fame. A great flick for a hot summer day--my wife laughed more than I did.

I still don't see how any of these clowns will ever make anything better than Old School. However, the actual story in the movie was fun. An emotional comedy, with an actual plot and an effort to make the story as realistic as possible, obviously in the realm of a comedy. Great performances by Vaughn and McAdams. It's so hard not to like her after this movie, I'm hoping I'll meet her one day.<br/><br/>The best idea the director had was making this movie 2 hours long, as to actually be able to insert a development towards the climax, as opposed to making a run of the mill slapstick comedy.

"LennyB","9","1","6","26 July 2005"," A Date Movie For Those of us Who Aren't Whipped
","I hate seeing reviews containing the term, ""this summer's best date movie."" What it usually means is the plot centers around a guy who is half-whipped at the beginning of the movie. Then, by the time Meg Ryan gets done with him at the end, he is completely whipped, a mere shell of his former self. We are led to believe he is happy.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is a ""new date movie."" It is about men and women, the lies they tell, the sex they enjoy, the fun they have, and...if they eventually become domesticated at the end...its without giving up what made them special in the first place. The trailers and plot summaries for Wedding Crashers may lead you to believe that the movie is about the adventures of two lying and lecherous guys. But, that is only half the story. The women in Wedding Crashers are smart, dynamic, deceitful, and damn sure, every bit as funny as their male counterparts. Women will love this movie, too.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play it super cool as two masters of the ""Wedding Crash"" -- freeloaders who cruise the Washington wedding scene in hopes of bedding down love-hungry bridesmaids. Against better judgment and the rules of ""The Crash,"" the pair become over-involved at the wedding of the Secretary of The Treasury's daughter. Violating their usual hit and run mantra, both join the family for an extended party at the official's estate.<br/><br/>Here, the casting of Christopher Walken as Secretary Cleary can almost be seen as a decoy. When you see Walken in the cast, you expect crazy. But he doesn't come close to the lunacy displayed by his wife, son, daughters and especially his mother. The hijinks involving Wilson and Vaughn and the various members of the wedding party are fresh, surprising, and for the most part, hilarious. Within it all, a love story sneaks up on you like a full nelson and draws you in before you have time to resist. <br/><br/>There would have been so many formulaic ways to create a sappy ""date-movie"" ending out of this story, but thanks to a fantastic script, hysterical performances by Wilson and Vaughn and the freedom of an R rating, Wedding Crashers remains true to its characters. There is no phoniness. We loved these guys at the beginning. We love them at the end. They have not changed for love. <br/><br/>Certainly a date movie for today's times, Wedding Crashers says we can be flawed, crude, and chronic liars, and instead of someone being out there to save us, there is someone out there to match us. I found the movie to be refreshing, clever, heartwarming, but most of all, simply hilarious."

"cadfile","9","1","6","23 July 2005"," Vince Vaughn should get an Oscar for his tour de force
","""Wedding Crashers"" is the funniest movie I've seen so far. The film is a Vince Vaughn tour de force. Owen Wilson is good in his laid back persona we know so well. There are cameos aplenty and the supporting characters are more than wallpaper to the Vaughn and Wilson skits.<br/><br/>Vince and Owen play 2 divorce mediators who love to show up uninvited at weddings for the free food and to pick up single women. That premises is funny by itself. Add in Vaughn's hyperactive party animal we last saw in ""Swingers"" and Wilson's suave intellectual and it takes the comedy up a notch.<br/><br/>This film was bust-a-gut funny for adults without being gross. Only one bathroom joke here. It was so nice to finally see a comedy that was aimed at adults and not 12 year old boys. But that doesn't mean 12 year old boys were ignored - there is some good looking women topless through out the film.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams plays Claire, Owen's love interest. She is the most normal of the Cleary clan. Isla Fisher's, who chews up scenes just like Vaughn, plays the spoiled crazy sister Gloria Cleary. Keir O'Donnell as Todd Cleary is the disaffected artist loner of the family and Ellen Albertini Dow plays Grandma Mary Cleary, who has some inappropriate things to say about Eleanor Roosevelt and Todd.<br/><br/>While Christopher Walken plays it pretty straight as Secretary Cleary, Jane Seymour plays against type as Kathleen Cleary a sex starved MILF. In one scene where she is coming on to Owen Wilson I thought to myself ""Dr. Quinn!!!"" and her inappropriate comments to Owen during the film were shockingly funny.<br/><br/>2nd place to Vaughn for best performance has to go to Sack Lodge, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper walks the fine line of being an ass and being over the top. He played a misogynist environmentalist who liked to hunt. That was humorous because most would think an environmentalist to be sweet and poetic all the time. Not Cooper and that was fun to watch.<br/><br/>The story was predictable but the comedy allowed me to ignore that. The film runs about 2 hours and while it does start to drag toward the end, the final scenes allow it to end on a high note.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Wilson were the best when they bickered but Vaughn still had the best lines and best gags. Vince should get some awards out of his performance and with dearth of good movies this year he should not have too much trouble. I dare even suggest an Oscar. His performance reminded me of Kevin Kline in ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and Kline won an Oscar."

","I'm admittedly a very tough nut to crack on comedies but this one broke the shell wide open. Most of the time I chuckle once and a while at best but I was in stitches for the whole two hours in Wedding Crashers. It ranks up there close to A Fish Called Wanda, When Harry Met Sally and Get Out Your Handkerchiefs in my book. An almost seamless film that takes stereotyped characters and bends them completely out of shape. There's a touch of genius in the interaction between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn that hints at the great comedy teams of Martin & Lewis, Burns & Allen and Abbott & Costello. Amid their screwball and cynical antics they let reveal an odd but working dynamic that drives through the madness of their own devices. Isla Fisher's addition as the kooky, nymphomanic sister is a great little sidebar entry adding more spice to the stew.<br/><br/>This is a movie that easily could have devolved into cheap visual tricks and potty humor but managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a quality product. Even the sappy and predictable ending doesn't diminish its overall shine. A good, solid eight. I hope we see more of these guys.<br/><br/>(BTW, my brother-in-law is a longtime wedding photographer and he says this kind of activity is not only feasible, he thinks it's fairly common at large weddings)"
"BrigitteD","9","1","6","23 July 2005"," Say ""I Do"" to seeing ""Wedding Crashers"".
","Long-time friends and business partners, John and Jeremy, are divorce mediators. Although it's rather ironic that these two specialize in giving out marital advice when you consider their own personal outlook and approach to relationships, or more appropriately, their lack thereof. <br/><br/>In their spare time, John and Jeremy are seen anticipating their favorite time of the year, the busy wedding season, during which they infiltrate various marriage ceremonies posing as distant relatives, in order to snag any available female guest or bridesmaid in attendance, if for nothing more than the purpose of indulging in a brief bedroom romp.<br/><br/>The latest wedding that the swinging bachelors set their sights on, is a highly publicized event, since it is to take place within a family of remarkable status which is headed by the treasury secretary. <br/><br/>To the outside observer, the Cleary family is a portrait of wealth and social prominence, but on the inside, it turns out to be quite a dysfunctional clan. There's the needy, sexually-frustrated wife, the artistic outcast son who displays homosexual tendencies, the sweet-looking, but vulgar and gun-brandishing grandmother. Then, there's sisters Claire and Gloria. John soon finds himself falling for Claire, who is obviously trapped within the confines of a potentially controlling relationship. Meanwhile, Jeremy finds himself wanting to escape the clutches of Gloria, a spoiled airhead who becomes possessive and begins latching on to him. <br/><br/>Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have been in many previous collaborations together without actually being at the helm as a team, and I'm hoping to see a continuation of this duo in possible future projects. They are two parts of a perfectly comedic structure which is further built to greater heights with the participation of all the other supporting cast members involved, with noteworthy praise for sugary-sweet rising star Rachel McAdams and sexy bombshell Isla Fisher who portray Claire and Gloria respectively.<br/><br/>There's also an amusing cameo appearance by Will Ferrell, who seems to be in just about every other movie these days, as a man who crashes another type of traditional congregation in an attempt to meet vulnerable women. <br/><br/>""Wedding Crashers"" is obviously intended for mature audiences since it abounds with nudity and sexual references, and it manages to be explicit without having to rely on the obligatory bodily function sight gags. But beneath all of the liberal exploits, there lies a more subtle undercurrent of romance that the female demographic will be able to appreciate as well."

I'm intending to go see it again really soon... wait for the bit with the ropes and the picture, so funny, you will be quote joking with your friends for months! if you like men in sharp suits and with hot hair cuts then his is a film for you, the casting is perfect, the only thing is possibly lacks its a little Luke Wilson action or maybe a touch of Ben Stiller, but it doesn't detract aways from the general joy! GO SEE IT and ENJOY"
"Kakaroto","10","1","6","21 July 2005"," A Movie Well Worth CRASHING Any Cinemas For ! !
","Saw it last night. And what can I say, I was blown away.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of arty-farty flicks, sweeping epics or gritty realism, then this film might not be your bucket of popcorn. If you're, however, like me, someone who knows how to appreciate unpretentious, over-the-top, slapstick, no-holds-barred, corny, clichéd yet hilariously entertaining lite watch, then this one's for you.<br/><br/>The premise is simple. Our dynamic duo here play two womanizing b**tards who are experts in crashing weddings, creating interesting backgrounds for themselves and generally getting laid as the sole objective of every successful crash. They get pussy thrown at them left, right and everywhere in between until they decide to crash the wedding of one of the most influential and powerful man's daughter. Following Hollywood comedy's tried-and-tested formula for disaster, they soon draw too much attention to themselves while courting two other sisters of the bride and as a result, get invited to spend time with the powerful family from Hell.<br/><br/>I don't wanna spoil anyone's fun, but rest assured, you'd see the full works of hilarious situations and laugh-a-minute antics. From foul mouthed granny to horny mum with breast implants to closet gay painter son to testosterone-filled-jackass son-in-law to just about every comedic cliché you can think of, this show will leave you asking for more at the end. Owen Wilson is his usual laidback, funny man with a conscience self but it is Vince Vaughn who steals the show. Razor-sharp lines, deadpan delivery and a penchant for physical comedy, he really shines in every single scene his obnoxious, self-centred man-boy character is in. The two of them share a fantastic chemistry, thanks to being long-time collaborators and real life buddies, and you could almost feel the enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun they must've had filming this enjoyable summer hit.<br/><br/>We get quite good performances from the side characters, with Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour thrown in the mix, Will Ferrel in a funny cameo role and of course, a lovely performance from Rachel McAdams. Granted, her character wasn't that hard to play, but she just oozes star quality and gorgeousness from every pore of her body.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, go watch the Wedding Crashers. Don't expect great story lines or Oscar-winning performances. Just go in there with a date / couple of friends, grab some snacks and be prepared to laugh out your soft drinks through your nose. A personal testimony: Without giving too much away, there was this scene at the dinner table which had me laughing till tears started rolling and my stomach hurting. *SLIGHT SPOILER* And when Vince Vaughn finally gave some poetic justice to the 'baddie' of the film, the whole cinema applauded with gusto. That was the first time I've been in a cinema in UK where the audience clapped as if it was a live show. Either it was a coincidence that all the expressive cinema-goers of Newcastle decided to watch this particular show at the day I was watching  OR it's just plain that the film hit the bullseye. I'm sure it did."
"alicatrr2","10","1","6","21 July 2005"," I'm amazed
","I walked into the theater expecting a funny male comedy, and being female, I prepared myself for non-stop horrendous sex jokes. I was only slightly off. Yes, most of the best jokes were predominately about sex, but they had me laughing and weren't the only types of jokes offered! And Vaughn and Wilson were fantastic together; it was completely easy to believe that these two characters were long-time friends. Constantly feeding off one another, I was entertained for the entire movie, and that doesn't happen to me often. All the actors in the film, with the possible exception of Cooper, impressed me and were wonderful. And beneath its sleazy exterior, there is a heart felt message about love that completely fits and brings the movie together. Definitely not for any young kids, nor sex-sensitive movie-goers. But great for anyone else. Best comedy of the year, hands down."

","This movie is a very funny, somewhat typical comedy that at times takes it self a little seriously, but nonetheless I found myself laughing the whole way through. Some jokes are stupid, of course, but regardless, many jokes were quick and smart, and I found it to be very amusing. I've seen many, many people bashing this movie on the boards here at IMDb, saying for people who like this movie to ""develop a sense of humor"". Clearly, they don't understand that everyones sense of humor is different, and they shouldn't be bashing other peoples opinions. Afterall, this is an opinion, nothing more. Regardless of what they say, I thought it was very funny, and basically, if you liked ""The Wedding Singer"", you'll probably like this movie, since they share the same humorous portrayals of weddings and the families involved. Also, don't take this movie too seriously, because if you do, it will ruin the fun of it for you and you probably wont like it. Remember, its just a comedy.<br/><br/>Well written, well acted, enjoy yourself."

","This is my new favorite comedy, it used to be There's Something About Mary. this movie kills that movie. Wedding Crashers just has it all. Its very raunchy at times but there's a lot of situational comedy where you're like ""oh my God, that's so funny, I could never have thought of that"" Some very good twist took place. Don't go based on the previews, Vince's girl is no virgin, I was shocked, she's actually a sex hound and a half. I could not stop laughing at this movie. And hey for all you ladies out there, there's a good love story to it. And I'm currently single ;) <br/><br/>Owen and Vince's chemistry is incredible, perfect, they were great together, definitely the best comedic couple in movies in a while. AND I'm SO GLAD that they did not pick some hot-shot big and famous actress to play the part of Claire, who is Wilson's ""lover"". For once there's no Kirsten Dunst, Cameron Diaz, Jen Aniston, whoever else is big as far as real hot/famous actresses go. Job well done to the casting crew, I think in this case they were the most important factor in the making of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall...Absolutely Hysterical...10/10"
"wessonjm","10","1","6","19 July 2005"," Its about time
","I have not laughed that hard in a long time. The recent PG-13 comedies just are not doing it for me. It was great crude humor. There were a few times where I missed a minute or two because I was laughing so hard. Owen Wilson does a great job, but Vince Vaugh runs away with the show. In my opinion he has to the funniest guy around right now. The ladies in the movie were looking good too. There was brief nudity but nothing to crazy. Will Ferrell make a cameo, and is really funny. I think the best thing about the movie is that it never quit. Right after a really funny scene and the movie slow for just a sec, and then bam right back to a gut buster. All and all very funny. I highly recommend, a must see..."
"Kenny_Mackay21","9","1","6","19 July 2005"," Not quite the funniest thing ever, but getting there...
","I can't say how much I loved this movie! Vince Vaughn is just awesome and is definitely the bedrock of the film. Owen Wilson is as laid back and hilarious as ever, and the two female leads certainly hold their own. The direction is pretty nifty too, and I like the idea that these guys spend all their time going to weddings and yet they're the biggest commitment-phobics ever. Even their jobs entail mediating divorce settlements. The story moves along apace and none of the jokes fall flat at all. I was surprised to discover afterwards that the running time is approaching two hours, because (though this is a cliché) it really never felt like it! Not to have seen this movie is wrong. Do something about it!"
"broken_bat","9","1","6","19 July 2005"," Realism in an unreal plot line
","After letting this movie get hyped up to no tomorrow it was a bit of a disappointment as a comedy. Don't get me wrong, it was hilarious, but it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than I thought.<br/><br/>On that note, it was an innovative and engaging romantic comedy that still followed the basic rule (guy gets girl, guy loses girl, guy wins girl back). I really enjoyed the chemistry between all the characters of the film. Even Walken, who had far too few number of appearances showed great chemistry with Wilson and Vaughn and especially his daughters. But above all, the two couples were completely realistic. Although these relationships formed from unlikely and improbably circumstances, the screenwriters and natural acting ability of Owen and Vince took over and it felt like you were actually watching a ""real"" relationship form.<br/><br/>My prime example is when Owen and Rachel McAdams' characters sat on the beach and Wilson sort of stumbles on his words while flirting. He bickers with her about how she has to wait for his hands to be ""set"" for the game of slaps. It was very cute and VERY realistic...<br/><br/>That's what makes this comedy so great. As unrealistic the plot and circumstances, the relationships, friendships, and true love that makes the comedy so funny are no less real than those you are a part of every day."

","Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher, Jane Seymour and Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>Jeremy(Vaughn) and John(Wilson) like to crash parties to sleep with beautiful women. They go to a party, make up fake names and identities, and get women from all over. They finally go to a party where John falls in love for Christopher Walken's daughter(Rachel McAdams). Jeremy has sex with her sister(Isla Fisher) on the beach, and she falls in love with him, but he hates her. AS this movie goes along, it becomes more of a romantic comedy, which is fine. McAdams gets angry when John reveals his true identity. She already had a boyfriend and fiancée, but he is a jerk. Jeremy falls for Isla Fisher and proposes to her. John is mad at him, and starts literally crashing weddings drunkenly by himself. Jeremy had often talked about his mentor Chaz(Ferrell) and John went and visited him. He lives with his mom, but has hot women. He then tells John that he's out of wedding crashing, and he's on to funeral crashing. When John goes with Chaz to the funeral, he sees a widow and realizes how low he's sunk. I won't give away the ending, but it's a good movie. There's a hilarious scene with McAdams and Fisher's brother who turns out to be gay.<br/><br/>My rating-B plus-88%. 114 minutes.<br/><br/>rated R for some scenes of sexuality/sexual humor, nudity and language."

The only down side to it was that often I was laughing so hard that I missed some really good lines that he fired off. The weakest part of the movie was the small part that Will Farrel had.

There were many good scenes that I can't even start to begin. The part where Vince got raped by crazy lady was priceless. Or the naked painting that was done? Or how about the part where Vince asked Owen if he did the motorboat? Haha. I laughed so hard during this entire movie that I forgot that I even went to New Mexico Military Institute with Owen from 1985-87. He is the next action/comedy star of the earth.

","These days it's very hard to make a funny adult comedy without some group being ""offended"". Already, here in Arizona, some people are giving Senator John McCain a hard time because he had a cameo in this R rated movie. How up tight is that? Well I for one loved this R rated movie and found it to be one of the most intelligent and well-written movies of the year. The catalyst that makes all this work is Vince Vaughn, I was laughing so hard at some of the predicaments he got himself into that I could not hear all of the fast-talking breakneck lines he was spewing out. And although he kept trying to get himself out of them, one of the Wedding Crashing rules, handed down from one generation to the next, ""Never leave a fellow crasher behind"", kept him coming back for more. Owen Wilson is also very good as the straight man and he has great chemistry with Vaughn. Even though there are a lot of ""Homo"" jokes in this film, these two are so secure in themselves that they can tell each other that they love each other, and you believe them. The supporting cast is also very funny, Christopher Walken (The Continental) is great, Rachel McAdams is a breath of fresh air, and Jane Seymour really pulls off the Mrs. Robertson part. This is a laugh out loud side-splitting film, and although there might be a few slow spots, it is destined to become a comedy classic. So go see it now and have some fun."
"Carycomic","9","1","6","16 July 2005"," Puts the ""fun"" in ""dysfunctinal.""
","I have to admit: this movie literally tested my patience, during the first fifteen minutes. but, unlike the first quarter-hour of ""Finding Neverland,"" I did NOT walk out of the movie theater. I stayed for the rest of ""Wedding Crashers."" And, I'm glad I did! Even when the rest of the audience wasn't laughing hysterically (which wasn't often), I did. This is the funniest Owen Wilson has been, for me, since those two Western-spoofs that he did with Jackie Chan! Vince Vaughn was hysterical, too. I confess that this is the first I've heard of him. There's no denying, though, that he has the most comedic fast-talk since John Moschitta did those Federal Express commercials. The actresses who play their love interests aren't half-bad, either. Rachel McAdams is suitably wholesome looking, as Claire. And, Isla Fisher (as ""Gloria"") does for redheads what Reese Witherstone and Alicia Silverspoon did for blondes. Specifically; prove that ditziness is only skin-deep. Best of all, is the uncredited cameo by Will Farrell. He's ten times funnier, during the last 20 minutes of this movie, than he was throughout all of ""Bewitched!"" *Way to go, Mr. F. And, Happy 38th birthday!* The only thing that prevented this movie from being a perfect ten was the Eleanor Roosevelt joke. But, that's just me."

","This is a great comedy all the way through, though it fails to escape some of the most cliché romantic comedy traps. Such as the final ""profession of love"" sequence. However, I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire film, and that for me, is rare.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play their parts flawlessly, especially Vaughn. He's at his best in this type of role, a character reminiscent of his breakout performance in Swingers, though he ultimately shows more depth here.<br/><br/>Though the story often times seems over the top and contrived, it all seems perfectly OK and as a viewer wanting to be simply entertained, it does so well. Besides, there are enough genuine offbeat scenes and humor to keep it fresh (the Vaughn bedroom scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>The whole nudity issue that seems to be so prevalent in the hype is GROSSLY OVERRATED. I'm not even sure why anyone who has seen it would think twice of it. All the nudity is not much more than flashes; certainly nothing to warrant the buzz it has created.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a genuinely funny film and worth seeing, especially for fans of Vaughn, Wilson or Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>As a pure side note, I was surprised that most of the people in the theta when I saw it were significantly older, most over 55. I guess its appeal is more wide spread than one might think."

It was the first time I saw her on screen, and something tells me I will see her again. Near the end of the movie, she cracked me up just by being on screen. Very good looking and very talented.<br/><br/>If you did not like these gentlemen's previous deliveries (e.g. Dodgeball, Old School, Anchorman, etc.), I doubt you will enjoy this one, so a DVD rental may be the best option.

","Saw ""Wedding Crashers"" today and thought it was hilarious. The audience was all walks of life.High school aged to elderly.Everyone laughed hard and there was applause at the end of the movie. While it seems the ""Frat Pack"" is constantly in a new movie every couple months, you can't argue with the comedic results. Anyone who likes Animal House, Bachelor Party,and etc will love this flick! Vaughn really has a better comedic presence than Wilson in my opinion. This Frat Pack seems to be quite the fad for comedies the last few years. In an era of such political correctness, nice to see a flick that isn't afraid to push the envelope with things that most people think but are afraid to express publicly nowadays. Funniest movie I've seen so far in 2005. As an aside, looks way better than that upcoming Dukes of Hazzard movie. That original cast must be in distress seeing their characters botched. ""Crashers"" on the other hand exceeded my expectations and will be on the Comedy channel for years to come I'm sure."
"curtman2","8","1","7","23 July 2005"," Crashers is Cool and Classy Summer Fun
","Aside from all of the Hollywood hogwash we've endured throughout the blazes of summer, ""Wedding Crashers"" falls in a class of its own, and can be welcomed as a bawdy, smart, and often tender fix on romantic antics and mostly classy comedy. Hysterical leads Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn really elevate the film's chaffing premise to grand comedic heights, with their jovial, affable chemistry, and witty deliverance of surprisingly smart one-liners. Rather than resorting to puerile scatological butts, ""Crashers"" offers clever romantic skylarking for sophisticated crowds, as well as classic raunchy escapades for more demure laughter, working on many comical levels. The story showcases the goofy, albeit charming Wilson- meeting and falling for the dashing and spirited Rachel Adams, who is dying for someone of Wilson's convivial nature to come along and whisk her away from a potentially imprisoning relationship, at Secretary of Treasury Christopher Walken's other daughter's wedding, which Wilson and Vaughn initially scheme to ""crash"". While Wilson is struggling with a growing affection for Claire Cleary which is tempering his wild-spiritedness by the day, Vince Vaughn is enduring torture of different sorts in the form of an abnormal virgin and a gay nudist art show. Eventually, you'd expect this scenario to cause a clashing between the two ""invincible party animals"", and you'd be right. The comedy, however, is hardly mired by Wilson and Adams' watery romance, and rather, works in between Wilson's pontifications of ""the special somebody"" and antique bike venturing along the beach, and you're left with a sweet and slushy romantic comedy. The laughs are pretty consistent throughout, as there always seems to be some comical edge in between inevitable sappiness. You'll have one particularly syrupy scene with Wilson and Adams wandering the hallways ""searching the night for one another"", immediately followed by Vince Vaughn strapped to a bed in a not-so-pleasant hysterical episode. It's comfortably tender as well as brassily campy, and overcomes many platitudes with its nonstop charms and innuendos. Wilson and Vaughn are perhaps the perfect comedic team, and are totally believable as the shrewd and quirky chick magnets they expertly play. The concept of ""one night stands"" has never been funnier, and the idea they are game players in ""bagging babes"" with their ""rules of conduct"" tunes the comedy quite affably, resulting in a crafty smartness that is often AWOL in other farcical fluff. ""Crashers"" cruises with charming, jovial, and surprisingly sharp dialog and humor, cool and whimsical characters, and amusing scenarios that provide top of the line comedy for just about any crowd in search of something refreshingly funny to weather down the blazes of the dog days of summer. Wilson and Vaughn are a real comic treat, and ""Wedding Crashers"" is one terrifically funny showcase of their synergistic savvies. Here's something rare: it's a comedy where you needn't check your brain at the door to have a laughingly good time, while also inviting you to lighten up and enjoy its routinely hilarious antics. ***1/2 out of ****"
"cultfilmfan","10","1","7","18 July 2005"," Wedding Crashers
","Wedding Crashers, is about two best friends named John Beckwith, and Jeremy Klein, who work together and in their free time they like to crash weddings. They go to weddings pretending to be related to someone there and hope they can pick up girls. They have done this many times before and the next wedding they crash is of a daughter of a treasury secretary where the two best friends pose as brothers. While at the wedding John meets his daughter named Claire Cleary, and John starts to fall in love with her. Another of the treasure secretary's daughters named Gloria, falls in love with Jeremy. Gloria convinces her dad to let them come and stay with them for awhile at their summer home. John, and Claire really seem to hit it off but she has a mean boyfriend who she may be getting married to soon. And, Jeremy finds Gloria kind of weird and in some ways wants nothing to do with her. Many conflicts arise and so does the humour as the two best friends pose as people they are not and try to not get caught as well as John, trying to woo Claire, and Jeremy trying to stay away from Gloria, and some other members of the very odd family. Wedding Crashers, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by Owen Wilson (who plays John Beckwith) and Vince Vaughn (who plays Jeremy Klein) as well as a good supporting cast, good original music and good cinematography. Next to Batman Begins, this film is the second biggest surprise of the year so far. I loved this film. Wedding Crashers, has great chemistry and good comedic performances by both Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn which really make the film work, some smart writing and it is an amusing, charming, fun, entertaining, sweet, enjoyable and everything you could want in a comedy that comes out just perfect. The film makes you laugh, is sweet and a lot of fun too. One of the best comedies I have seen in awhile and also one of the best films of the year so far."

But what else would you expect when you put Vince Vaugn and Owen Wilson in a movie together. The casting director was a genius. The movie starts off great when you get to see a day in the life of these two wedding crashers, crashing every kind of wedding that is possible. From Jewish to Chinese, you name it. But the movie really kicks it into high gear when vince vaughn and owen Wilson enter the wedding of all weddings, the Secretary Treasurers wedding, from there, all hell breaks lose.<br/><br/>The good points about the movie are that every scene with owen Wilson, and ESPECIALLY Vince Vaughn will have you laughing till your stomach hurts. The only character in the movie that i did not like was this one jerk who keeps getting in the way of owen Wilson and his love interest from being together.

"rooprect","7","0","1","5 March 2012"," Funny. That's all that matters.
","This movie takes us to the edge of what's tasteful. Then it pulls our underwear over our heads and spanks us mercilessly. If you can handle it, you'll have a great time.<br/><br/>""Wedding Crashers"" is a movie about a pair of 40-something men who have all the morals and tact of a bunch of teenagers on spring break. They run around crashing weddings, helping themselves generously to the food, music, and oh yeah, the women. In order to do this, they pull every trick in the book, trample on the sanctity of marriage, religion, peoples' feelings, and they're particularly cruel to German pop rock singer Nena by singing their hilariously horrible version of ""99 Luftballoons"" (a scene that was cut from the movie but available on the DVD deleted scenes). In other words, this is a movie that could possibly offend many people, but I don't think it does.<br/><br/>The reason why it doesn't offend us, despite its borderline sexist, iconoclastic and irreverent approach, is because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are the most lovable dorks you can imagine. They're not foul-mouthed neanderthals trying to subjugate the entire female species; instead they're really sweet guys who are shown to be sensitive, humble and more-or-less intelligent. They just happen to be on a quest for some nookie.<br/><br/>Isla Fisher gives a great supporting performance as a mentally unbalanced nympho... sort of the female counterpart to the guys. Rachel McAdams plays the straight role giving the film stability. And Christopher Walken is... well, he's Christopher Walken. Nuff said.<br/><br/>Don't expect a morality play, because this ain't one (at least not in the conventional sense). Just expect a lot of corny gags which are brilliantly executed. It can get pretty racy at times, but nothing explicitly raunchy. I'd put it in the same class as ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", ""There's Something About Mary"" and the hilarious Australian comedy ""The Wannabees"" (for you fans of Isla Fisher).

"Saiako1","1","0","2","3 February 2012"," This movie is just, the worst thing.
","I don't know in what universe rape, disrespect and utter brainlessness is considered funny. But this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First and foremost, both Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are terrible actors. The writers for this movie are not very good. The characters are all flat and to make up for that they made most of them a clichéd insane. The main characters are just painfully boring. As a comedy it fails miserably. I hated every scene, the scene where they pick up chicks at weddings is sickening. They have no respect for women whatsoever. And somehow you are supposed to feel sorry for Vince when he is tortured at the house they stay at. His character is a sorry excuse for a human being, but the actions that the two siblings took against both of the characters is nothing short of just plain stupid and unnecessary. I don't know if they meant for this part of the movie to be their punishment for being such losers or if they were trying to make it even more funny. The characters are supposedly at an impasse in their lives, one of them falls in love with a woman, blah blah blah. I've heard the same story in better movies. Go back to the drawing board writers. Or maybe try taking a creative writing class and stop making such dry unoriginal bullshit."

","Wedding Crashers mayn't be a perfect film, but it is a very funny one. The editing could've been smoother and transitioned better into scenes, the film is a tad over-stretched in the final act and it could've been shorter. However, with its rude, raunchy yet very funny humour, the film is very funny helped by the witty script. The idea for the story is a good one, and works wonderfully in two-thirds of the movie, it is well filmed and directed and has a memorable soundtrack. The cast are great, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are great together and both give some of their best work of their careers. Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher and Jane Seymour also impress. The characters are clichéd in a sense, but they are also examples of those that you learn to love the more you see the film. Overall, a lot of fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Wilson and Vaughn are hardly comedic heavy-weights to carry a comedy on their shoulders, especially one based on a forgettable script. Besides, they don't have that much charisma. And Ferrell fails again to be funny. (Why is there so much hype regarding this guy?) To make things worse, there is plenty of totally absurd, dull sentimentality, especially in the second half. All these semi-cartoon characters are established early on - and we are supposed to take them seriously later on?? You can't have your cake and eat it, too. A screwball comedy AND a romantic drama. Come on...<br/><br/>Christopher Walken is the only high-quality actor in this average cast, but his role is too small to make a difference. The movie has no funny moments; it is merely somewhat interesting to watch, at least until the inevitable moment when things start getting too predictable and soppy i.e. formulaic. And the movie lasts nearly two hours: FAR too long for a (mostly dull) comedy."

","I didn't like this movie. While slapstick comedies involving embarrassing situations and bodily fluids do work (see American Pie,) this one just falls flat. What really made it not work for me from the very beginning was that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are just way too old to be crashing weddings. Maybe that's the point, and there is a moment when a character comments that Owen Wilson's character is ""not that young"" - an understatement in this particular situation. Anyone over the age of 25 should not be behaving in this manner, never mind men pushing 40. They're too old for their behavior; they're too old for the women they end up with (well, maybe not by Hollywood standards... ick!); they're too old to be funny with this premise. Too, too much."

To those who say Will Ferrell ruined the movie, you're idiots; you should go and get new opinions because the one you've got is wrong.

","Wedding Crashers is a brilliant movie!! I watched it on DVD and am going to watch it again. I was going through the comments of others and some of them found the script poor, story boring, very predictable....etc. But the point is that when you have decided what you are going to watch, then you should know what will it be like?!! I was in a mood for some comedy so I picked this up and I had a hell of time. These kind of movies are not meant to be winning Oscars or Golden Globes.!! These are light movies which a person can enjoy and spend a good 90-100 minutes. Owen Wilson as usual is in his class(I still can't believe he starred in ""Behind Enemy Lines"") This movie of his' was a bit different. It was a comedy one but later turned into a romantic movie. But the FIND of the movie as I like to call it was Rachel McAdams. When we saw her in Mean Girls I thought we will continue seeing her in teen movies, but not to be! Here she delivers a brilliant performance. Not only did she look adorable and pretty but her acting has improved CONSIDERIBLY!! She expressed the emotions of her character superbly!! Vince Vaughn has finally found a good role in this movie. We have seen his bits and pieces in movies but we saw the whole package here. All in all, for those who knew what to expect from this movie would have had a smile on their faces after the 2 hours but those who were expecting more from it never really understood what the movie promised and as far as I am concerned it did a lot more then keeping its promise!!!"

","For the first hour and a half were hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing, however watch out for that last half hour or so. It gets pretty slow towards the end, and a little mushy for the type of genre that it is.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson and Vince Vaugn work surprisingly really well together, and although I've really grown to dislike Vaugn, I found him to be hilarious in this, and actually thought that he portrayed his character very well. Wilson as usual, was not only good looking, but hysterical and nailed every line to the 'T'. I was surprised to see Jane Seymore in a film like this, but then I was also surprised to see Christopher Walken except a part like this as well.<br/><br/>I love Rachel McAdams, and so of course I was delighted to see her in the movie. The chemistry was really good between all of the cast members, and the set design, direction and writing were all excellent. But, again, the only reason why I don't give this movie a full ten is simply because of the ending. I felt it dragged on way too much for the comedy that was given earlier on in the film, and it made parts that should have been funny, more sentimental and corny. Which, is really hard to do with Vince Vaugn in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's definitely the kind of movie you're gonna watch with your sweetie, but probably not one you'd dare watch as a first or second time date. There's some humor in it you might not want to chance with someone you don't know very well, but that's just my suggestion. I loved it, and will more than likely watch it again in the near future."
"Ppumperman","10","0","4","12 April 2006"," Funniest movie.
","Wedding Crashers is by far the funniest movie of the year. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are hilarious. They are a perfect match on the screen. With contrasting appearances (i.e. height, hair, and atire) they bring balance the 'Comedy Universe'. The basic plot of the movie is simple: two guys go crash weddings. Crashing a wedding is when you and a friend attend a wedding, uninvited, and party the night away. The crash is successful when the 'crasher' awakens the next morning with a female from the party. The movie depicts the trials and tribulations of two 'JV' crashers. Yet somehow, there is so much more to it. With a hilarious script pumped out by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher, the film satires the entire dating process. Littered with clever sayings and funny situations, this movie is a hit. Not to mention the knockout performance by Christopher Walken. Not only is Walken one of the funniest men on the planet equipped with a side-splitting script, he constantly delivers every word of every line with the same funny Chris Walken Voice everyone has come to know and love. I recommend this movie to anyone who has the capacity to laugh at small children, gays, old people, and crazy swingers. All of which are poked fun at. The catchy dialog and a bit of slap stick makes Wedding Crashers a must watch."

The movie has some very good actors-especially Owen Wilson, but wastes their talents with its odd combination of sweetness and pre-pubescent humor. The plot lacked development and never allowed for the suspension of disbelief. The rich political family was so stereotypical, and trite as to be totally inane and annoying. The ending was both predictable and full of nonsense. The script dangled many points in front of the audience-such as instability and sexual infidelity of wife Jane Seymour and all rich people-then left them dangling along with the audience. Wilson and Vaughan were much better-a real script and plot (trite as they were-in Starsky and Hutch. Teaming these two should lead to a great movie experience.

","his was the highest grossing comedy of 2005. It ain't bad. They have a little too much of the romance plot in the film, which is sappy and occasionally slows down the picture. There's also a way-too-long montage near the beginning where we see Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn crashing a bunch of weddings that should have been way funnier. Coming so early in the movie, it had me a little worried. But, when it gets going, it is often laugh-out-loud funny. I always knew that Vince Vaughn had some real comedic talent. He's always fairly amusing in any comedy he's in, but I've never seen a movie where the material was really up to his abilities. Here, he gets most of the best material. That's almost disappointing just for the fact that he's co-starring with Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken (the latter sits on the sidelines through almost all the movie), but Vaughn manages always to keep the movie funny. Wilson, I think, is a very funny man, and he is often funny here. But he's the one stuck in the romantic plot of the film, and they don't let him be as funny as he ought to be. If the screenwriters had balanced things out a little, let both the stars work their stuff, this probably would have been the best comedy of the year. Isla Fisher is also pretty amusing as the crazy girl who falls for Vaughn. There's also an actor who appears in a cameo late in the picture who is simply hilarious, but I won't ruin that for anyone. Rachel McAdams, whom I think is the most beautiful woman alive right now, is sweet as the love interest, but, in that role, she has little to do."

Maybe i just don't like these recent comedies such as 40 yr Old virgin and This crap pile. Its just talk and no comedy. I cant listen to sex jokes for hours like this movie does. The movie should been rated PG-13 and just cut the nudity, then it would have catered to more. The motorboat is stupid. And half way through the movie the story changes from comedy based to love oriented. The jokes were too obvious and Chris Walken, who I've met, could've been replaced by a cheap no name guy as he didn't do anything but stand there. Reverse Waynes World 2 style (the Charleston Heston scene) I saw this and the Duece Bigelow 2 the next night and Duece was more laugh eliciting, although terrible.

How can you make jokes about guys that take advantage of happy girls at weddings and crash weddings for people they don't know? The plot builds on the fact that girls tend to get hopeful when attending a wedding where you see two people in love promising to live together ever after. These two guys really destroys all that. Even worse what's the fun in tricking grieving girls at funerals as they do later on in the movie? I didn't laugh once and that's a bad grade for a comedy movie. Otherwise it's a good movie.

The movie is not hard to sit through but neither is it particularly memorable once it's all over. Personally, I would have liked to get a little more information on HOW these two con artists always manage to get a seat at the dinner tables? Do they forge place cards or what? It can't just be as simple as showing up in a suit and pretending to be related to someone who isn't there. Ah well, it's a comedy... we're not meant to be concerned about how realistic it all is. We're only meant to judge how *funny* it is. Unfortunately, one week later and I hard-pressed to come up with one memorably-funny line or gag from the flick. I'm sure I was smiling amiably throughout (did I mention how dang *charming* the two leads are?) but the hilarity I was expecting just did not occur. Christopher Walken plays a Kennedy-esquire politician but it's a nothing role and it doesn't have much of the old Walken zing to it.

They are lithe and enthusiastic in plying their craft,bedding as many cute,willing-to-marry honeys and leaving behind little or no trace of themselves along the way. Their ability to mold into differing weddings of various religions and cultures is a feat to behold,an nearly athletic endeavor of achievement. Alas,they,while completely carnally satisfied,find themselves at a point of emptiness. They're getting older(read:late thirties)and yet feeling like they're missing...something. Prety familiar stuff so far,but still done with a deft touch.<br/><br/>As fate would have it,they target the wedding of the oldest daughter of a prominent government official(Christopher Walken,well-cast)and set their sights on his two younger daughters(RAchel McAdams and Isla Fisher,both sexy and very charming). However,the boys cleave ways when they discover their targeted conquests are far more than they bargained for.<br/><br/>Director David Dobkin and writer Bob Fisher(there's another writer credited. I forget at this moment whom) are able to make this film both clever and yet familiar,sexy and yet sweet and the ability of the actors(Vaughn mostly)to ad-lib through the film make this film as fluid as it is kinetic. Add in Dr.Quinn herself,one JAne Seymour,as the horny,bitter wife of Walken's character to the mix and you have one largely entertaining comedy that screams ""Summer flick!"" all over. If you dig comedies,but want something that trips along smoothly(albeit fairly predictably),then this film is for you."
"wizard42","5","0","1","2 October 2005"," An iffy movie...
","I went to this film with very high hopes based on all I had read about the film, and was very disappointed. Yes it contains a few laugh out-loud moments, but for the most part it fails to deliver. The problem is that Owen Wilson is playing the same exact character yet again. While it was funny the first few times out, the character needs to change and grow up, it's no longer amusing. The script is for the most part forced, particularly the predictable way the movie ends. None of it seems to be real. The humor that could have been garnered from the eccentricities of the Treasury Secretary's family (the Cleary's) led by Christopher Walken, is lost because we have to spend too much time on the juvenile delinquent leads. As a result your left with two movies, the juvenile one, which the filmmakers seem to want to make, in which the leads crash weddings (and a funeral which is really sick and not funny), and the one in which a zany family is on display, which the filmmakers throw away. Frankly, I preferred the zany family. The musical backdrop for the film is also jarringly inappropriate at several moments, and this definitely distracts from the film. On the other hand Walken is bright and amusing, and Rachel McAdams has a few genuine moments as Clair. Unfortunately there is little chemistry between her and Wilson, and the romantic moments seem forced. However, her portrayal of a young women torn between familial duty, and wanting to chart her own course is very fine, it just doesn't belong in the juvenile comedy the filmmakers wanted to make. All in all a disappointment, although the family comedy redeems the film, and makes it watchable."

","*May contain spoiler* Maybe I was just having a bad day, but for whatever reason, I didn't like the movie all that much. There were some decently funny scenes, but nothing specific comes to mind when i try to think of the best scene. It didn't leave that much of an impression on me. All i saw in it was lots of nudity and sexual references. The jokes seemed shallow and distasteful, but it could still be funny to a good many people. Another reason could just be that certain characters reminded me of people I knew who I was trying to forget at the time, so whenever that person would come up, I would be reminded of someone else. Definitely not a good thing. This movie shouldn't be seen with parents, and it probably wouldn't make a good date movie either. One or two quotable parts top it off, but not any terrific extent. The movie Serenity had no nudity and no sexual references the entire movie, and it was still a much funnier movie than Wedding Crashers. That's saying something considering Serenity is a space-action-scifi of terrific extent. Just as good if not better than the Matrix! Save your money from Wedding Crashers and use it to see Serenity."
"nobleho","8","0","1","22 September 2005"," Wonderful wedding
","The wedding crashers features a fantastic cast and from the very first second the movie starts there is non stop laughter. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn do more than perform as the 'Crashers' John and Jeremy but are almost (only almost) outshone by the fantastic talents of Aussie actress Isla Fisher who plays her role as goofy yet lovable Gloria perfectly. And newcomer Racheal McAdams, who is fantastic as Claire Cleary. Vince gets the best lines but Owen will sure have you in stitches to, and as well as the actual comedy there is also hidden depth in there facial expressions and posture. A fantastic Laugh out loud comedy thats worth its weight in gold."
"vselles","9","0","1","20 September 2005"," Fun all through the way!
","There's nothing particularly new about ""Wedding Crashers"". It's the typical ""boy tries to win girl's heart"" throughout the whole movie. Nothing unusual, nothing different, but simply hilarious! The story has a good deal of twists, but it surprisingly goes in a way that makes them seem natural. All brought up with sensational jokes, funny situations (which, apart from one or two, are quite believable) and an animated soundtrack, which suits the film perfectly. It was already a good comedy film, and then Will Ferrel jumps in. I usually don't like his style (too obvious as a comedian IMO), but he fits the film just fine. And provides a great bridge to even funnier situations (and a superb joke right before the end) and to the final twist. No, this is not about telling a story you haven't heard of or seen in another film. It's about telling it in a funnier way! And you'll laugh all through it, unless you have a dry sense of humour. In this case, you'd better avoid this film, because it's pure entertainment!"

","I was so reluctant to see this movie but after a few girlfriends convinced me to do so I found myself laughing sooooo hard. Funny how movies that come out so well can improve the quality of your life. I normally don't post comments unless I have something to say and this movie made me stand up and shout... ""GREAT!"" I believe this will go down as one of the all time classics of our decade. Doesn't mean that this will be known as the best... just as a great piece of entertainment worth paying for. I loved it and so did all my friends and they're a tough bunch to convince. Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself."

","This comedy is definitely the best of the year. Its a comedy so you expect to laugh, but their's a strange very well-executed twist to the ways they can make you laugh one minute and almost cry the next. Its a very effective blend of emotions mixed up by all the main characters. Along with the great comedy, was also an ingenious plot. This is a comedy that will be remembered, it stars 2 perfect actors in their roles, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, their first film together, and I hope it won't be the last. And to add a touch still has old greats such as Christopher Walken. They are all the perfect actors!! <br/><br/>Now lets go on to the story line, John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vaughn) or life long friends that have known each other forever and work together and share a common summer past-time, wedding crashing! Where they always make up story's to basically sleep with women they meet at wedding's, but one day they go to a very big wedding, over 500 people, and the girl Jeremy meets falls in love with him, which is never part of they're plan, so in a hilarious way both agree to come with them for a weekend, and they're Jeremy always wants to leave, not knowing John is falling for Claire, who has a boyfriend. On a slow, hilarious route to discovery the character development is demonstrated and the props are ingenious. Enough said.<br/><br/>Every scene is this film makes you laugh in one way shape or form, maybe because its funny, maybe because its embarrassing or outrageous or maybe because its sad and emotional. The amazing thing is, this film combines many aspects of real life, and shows the importance of friendship and having someone by your side. It also has many genres, comedy above all, romance and drama.<br/><br/>The reason so this film has made so much money and so many people have seen it is because of the rare combination and sequence of events and the clever twist it gives and the image it demonstrates is very appealing.<br/><br/>Overall this is a must see film, its in no way perfect, but hey which film is anyway, but it is worthy of being acknowledged as one of the best comedies so far this century. I give it 9/10"

So anyway that is really what I want to know, other than that it was a good movie, glad to see that comedies are back that aren't rated PG-13, gotta go for the R and let some of the real stuff fly out there. So yeah I gotta waste 10 lines so I'm just going to blab on here for a bit but I really do want to know what that song was, its really getting to me cause I cant remember it so if anyone out there can tell me the name or who sings it or any lyrics that would be great cause it was a good song, I thouhgt it was Janis Joplin or someone like that but I'm just not sure, alright good to go."
"MaxBorg89","7","0","2","10 September 2005"," Wilson + Vaughn = Unmissable (well, most of the time)
","After playing second fiddle to Ben Stiller in Zoolander, Starsky & Hutch and Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn (who also had a supporting role in Old School, which starred Luke Wilson) and Owen Wilson (Luke's brother) finally get to carry their own Frat Pack movie, and the results aren't as sharp as when Stiller's involved. Why? Probably because Wedding Crashers is a romantic comedy - albeit of the weird kind - and therefore things tend to get messy from a strictly narrative standpoint, especially in the third act.<br/><br/>The story is about two divorce mediators, John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vaughn), who spend their free time going to as many weddings as possible (uninvited, of course, otherwise it would be no fun), so they can drink free booze and seduce as many hot chicks as possible. Things get complicated at the latest wedding, when John falls in love with the Treasury Secretary's (Christopher Walken) daughter (the simply wonderful Rachel McAdams), while Jeremy ends up with her sister Gloria(Isla Fisher, hilarious). From there on, hell breaks loose, be it in the form of hunting trips, kinky nighttime sex games or horny middle-aged mothers (that would be Jane Seymour).<br/><br/>The real heart of Wedding Crashers is Wilson and Vaughn: one provides the sweet stuff (though not in a sickly way) thanks to good chemistry with McAdams, the other goes straight for the belly-laughs and scores gloriously, most memorably in the already classic family dinner scene. From the very beginning, when an Animal House-like montage shows their MO, it's clear their very real friendship is the main reason to see the movie, which manages to be one of the funniest films of 2005 for about 50 minutes.<br/><br/>What happens then? Well, the script runs out of energy when it has to tie everything up, and so we get dull subplots and a Will Ferrell cameo which, while fun, was clearly added because there was nothing else to do. Hell, even Christopher Walken appears to be clueless in the final act. Fortunately, the ending doesn't get too sloppy thanks to, you guessed it, Vaughn and Wilson. Next time, though, a little more care during the writing process wouldn't hurt."

","This film is a scream...the premise is quickly set by the Director as the two main characters blitz through a series of weddings. This sets up the remainder of the story, which is a wedding of the U.S. Treasury Secretary's (Christoper Walken) daughter. Our leading men see a superb opportunity for world-class food, drink and girls and go for it.<br/><br/>A great film starts quickly and grabs your attention - and keeps it.

","I'm far from being a prude, and I'm not going to detail the ""proof"" of that statement...and despite being a big Owen Wilson fan, I came away from this film more disappointed than satisfied.<br/><br/>In theory the ""plot"" has a lot of promise, but in actuality I found myself bored despite a succession of beautiful naked breasts displayed on screen as the two ""heroes"" plied their seduction routines at a variety of weddings, and a raunchy masturbation scene at a fancy dinner party.<br/><br/>Wilson just failed to show much depth, IMO, and despite the luscious ladies, I never found myself getting ""into"" the movie. In fact, all of the lead actors were wasted...again, of course, IMO. I had to fight the urge to get up and leave the movie before it was over. Considering the scenery (I do like to look at pretty ladies), that's extremely strange. <br/><br/>I guess, in the final analysis, I felt the movie relied on sex instead of a story line and, for me, lacked the humor needed for a movie intended to be a comedy.<br/><br/>Save your money unless naked breasts are worth the price of admission to you."

","Finally!! A film where Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are the lead characters TOGETHER. Vince Vaughn, in my opinion, is one of todays most underrated actors. I'm so glad to finally see him in a leading comedy role - hopefully he'll be doing a lot more of these, especially with Owen Wilson! From start to finish the film had me laughing, so many unexpected twists and turns - and a nice appearance by Will Ferrell stuck in there as well (I knew it was coming somewhere!) The film has an interesting plot, not something that I've seen done before (thankfully) and it was nice to see that Wilson & his girl didn't end up married like most films would have done.<br/><br/>The part where Vaughn is tied to the bed frame, and his girl's brother comes in....Shock wasn't the word, lol Lots of good characters that all fit in together nicely."
"NoArrow","6","0","1","29 August 2005"," Watchable, if over-hyped
","One of the most unnerving things about ""Wedding Crashers"" is that the two leads are just as sleazy and despicable as the film's villain, but we're suddenly supposed to sympathize with them because they've found girls they like. What these two need is comeuppance...but leave that to a darker comedy, I guess. So try to forget about that while you're watching it.<br/><br/>John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to meet, seduce and dump girls. They've got it worked out to a system, which is humorous because it's believable. But John is having second thoughts about their irresponsible, even hurtful lifestyle. Then at a wedding they meet the Cleary sisters (Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher) and fall for them. The two sisters are immediately accepting of them, and invite them out to their rich father's summer cottage.<br/><br/>The father is played by Christopher Walken, and it's probably the first time in this guy's career that he's been underused. Who the hell under-uses Christopher Walken? He's there to be overused! The strange thing is that it's clear the filmmakers know how to be funny...there are many funny moments, and Vince Vaughn is hilarious. But there are so many gaps between the really good jokes, and the writer gets lazy when he resorts to the phoned-in gay and T&A jokes. And lots of great comedic opportunities are missed, as when Walken walks in on Vaughn after he's been tied to the bed by Walken's horny daughter. This could've been the funniest scene in the movie, but instead, nothing happens.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is probably the movie's biggest success. He manages to do what Jack Lemmon did in ""Some Like it Hot"": to create a believable, funny character and also establish a personality for himself for movies to come. The performance is not as memorable as Lemmon's, because the movie isn't as memorable (not by a mile), but Lemmon's got an Oscar nod, and I do think Vaughn deserves some consideration.<br/><br/>The movie's lack of morals hurt it as well. John and Jeremy never feel even slightly sorry for their deeds, and hypocritically exploit the wrongs of Claire's silly evil fiancé Sack. Characters as dark as these are only really funny in movies with some sort of moral message or point, the message here seems to be ""do what you want, worry only about yourself"". But I guess it seems to be the general agreement these days that a movie with morals can't be funny.<br/><br/>The movie's sleazy, terribly uneven, and almost like a collection of missed opportunities, with a great performance from Vaughn and funny parts here and there.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","Nice comedy here. At first I thought this was just another one of those movies that were 'supposed' to be funny. But then, this one turned out to be a blast. Not a laugh-out-loud, slapstick type of comedy, but one that can get you laughing, and smiling, too.<br/><br/>Actually, I was more like chuckling than laughing at the characters' antics. But the nice thing about this one was that all the major characters delivered the laughs...butler included.<br/><br/>I think girls would like this movie. It's got a nice touch to it. Although the main characters are guys, the scene stealers happened to be the girls, especially Isla Fisher.<br/><br/>Not much to say about the great Christopher Walken, though.

","""Wedding Crashers"" is unevenly funny. <br/><br/>The first third very amusingly introduces the premise of the charming Owen Wilson and motor mouth Vince Vaughn as the titular con men suavely moving from divorce mediation to multi-ethnic celebrations and quickly earns its ""R"" rating with brief nudity as they successfully bed their targets. It is cute that all the dances climax with the Isley Brothers' ""Shout."" The pair are just funny riffing off each other. <br/><br/>The second third drags down in ""Philadelphia Story""-like competition with a post-wedding WASP-y family weekend. While Jane Seymour as the randy matriarch adds some humor, her character's tipsiness, as well as the grandmother's senile comments, just become yet another stereotype in the household. The boyfriend is just plain crassly mean (even if his punches don't seem to have any lasting impact on anyone), particularly disconcerting as Bradley Cooper usually plays nice guys. The brother's character is way too broadly drawn odd, like a homophobe's idea of a gay guy, if Igor from ""Young Frankenstein"" was a closeted homosexual. Christopher Walken is given far too little to do; even as his scenes build up to expectations, he's not allowed to let loose.<br/><br/>What lights ups this section is Isla Fisher as a sister who turns male fantasies on their head. Even her Mutt and Jeff size difference with Vaughn is amusing. The women show spunk in the first two-thirds then are just blanded down to smiles. Rachel McAdams (as a brunette this time) has lines with personality at first, but then just becomes an object of affection, even as she gets in a nice dig that Wilson isn't that young any more, as he is obviously quite older than she. <br/><br/>The last third has some funny twists, particularly with an unexpected cameo and some outrageousness before it settles into conventionality. The final wedding is at least not a repeat of ""The Graduate.""<br/><br/>The camera work is pedestrian, with close-ups indicating serious thinking."

","The raunchiness of this film recalls the fun of the early 80s, before the AIDs scare combined with the PC movement ruined all stupid T&A comedies forever. If you think that Vince Vaughn's motor mouth is second only to Woody Allen's, this is your film. Some have said this is his best work since Swingers, but I actually think it's a step up. Bradley Cooper pleasantly surprises as the dead-on annoying, better-than-you-are east coast frat boy. Somebody else's conspicuously uncredited performance is hilarious. Rachel McAdams is hot. I've seen others trash Own Wilson's work in this, but I thought he did great. Finally, the movie does a good job of swinging between plausible and absurdist moments, with Wilson catching most of the serious ones. Enough said. I give this 8 of 10."

","Welcome to one view of the world of the 30-something single male. Always on the look-out for the next available girl, partying like you're 21 again and so on. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play two guys living just like this, crashing weddings with fake back stories and having one hell of a time until, at the wedding of the powerful government Secretary (played by Christopher Walkin), one falls in love with the Secretary's daughter and the other has a fling with his other daughter and thinks her certifiable! Needless to say, much buffoonery and attempts at merriment ensue. Mostly, I found myself barely sniggering but there are a few memorable moments. The one-on-one scene between the Secretary's odd son and Vince Vaughn is one where I laughed out loud and some of the best moments are when Owen Wilson goes to meet the original Wedding Crasher, called Chaz, played by the show stealing Will Ferrell. Walkin is sadly under used which is a real shame as good use of his character could have added more to the uneven comedy. The two main girls look good and carry off their roles quite well but Vaughn and Wilson seem, despite their hell-raising roles, to be on cruise control and subdued. Overall, if you're after laughs you'll get a couple here but don't expect your sides to split!"

","I was excited and intrigued to see the latest big comedy 'Wedding Crashers'. The reason for that is because it starred Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, two very funny comedic actors who never really had a chance to steal the show. Whether it was Vince Vaughn in Old School (the show was stolen by Will Ferrell), or Owen Wilson in 'Starsky & Hutch' (Ben Stiller owned that movie), the two never really stood out in their films. For me, 'Wedding Crashers' took two very good yet underrated comedic actors and gave them a chance to really showcase their talent without Stiller or Ferrel stealing the movie. I was expecting a funny movie, and I got a freakin' hilarious film that could go down as a classic screwball gross-out comedy just like 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' or even the masterful 'Animal House'. 'Wedding Crashers' is likely to bring out the dirty, raunchy and wild party animal in all of us.<br/><br/>'Wedding Crashers' is the story about two best friends, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn). By day they work as divorce court mediators, but at night they work at crashing weddings to score ditsy and vulnerable chicks. Whether it's American, Italian, Jewish, Indian or Chinese weddings, John and Jeremy always manage to be the hit of the party and get a couple of scorching looking babes in the sack. One day, the perfect opportunity approaches them. They get a chance to crash the weddings of all weddings -- the wedding of the Washington, D.C. State Treasurer's (Christopher Walken) daughter. Jeremy and John go to the wedding and find girls; John gets to know the sweet, funny and affectionate eldest daughter Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), and Jeremy gets to know the bi-polar, crazed youngest daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) with the psychotic squeaky laugh. Gloria falls for Jeremy (who's afraid of her), and both him and John get invited to spend the weekend at the Cleary family compound. During the weekend, all hell breaks loose! John tries to win Claire over so she'll leave her stuck-up verbally-abusive a-hole boyfriend (Bradley Cooper), while Jeremy tries to get away from the insane Gloria.<br/><br/>Calling 'Wedding Crashers' funny is a whopper of an understatement. I haven't laughed so hard in a movie theater since I saw 'Team America'. However, the film isn't as funny the second half as it is the first half. The first half is absolute comic brilliance with outrageous laughs and yucks, but the second half (still very funny) gets very sappy and turns into a sort-of love story. Vince Vaughn steals the entire film as the smart-mouthed Jeremy who always is doing or saying something hysterical. Owen Wilson is also funny playing his typical witty slick guy he played in 'Starsky and Hutch' and 'Shanghai Noon'. Rachel McAdams is good for her bland role of the sweet and kind Claire, but Isla Fisher is drop dead hilarious as the psychotic and spoiled younger daughter who takes a liking to Vince Vaughn. I was disappointed of how watered-down Christopher Walken's character was because he really is a talented comedic performer if given the chance. Jane Seymour co-stars as the sex-hungry wife of Walken who wants to score Owen Wilson in the sack, while newcomer Keir O'Donnell is a hoot as the disturbed gay son who tries to score Vince Vaughn in the sack. The film also has bit parts by Rebecca De Mornay, Dwight Yokam and the token old-lady Ellen Albertini Dow (Adam Sandler's grandma from 'The Wedding Singer') playing Walken's foul-mouthed and bigoted elderly mother.<br/><br/>There isn't much to not like about 'Wedding Crashers'. If it wasn't for the second half dragging, I would have enjoyed it a hell of a lot more. David Dobkin does a fine job directing this (his previous efforts were 'Shanghai Knights' which starred Wilson, and 'Clay Pigeons' which starred Vaughn.) For the type of movie 'Wedding Crashers' is it's superior in so many ways. I recommend seeing it in the theaters if you haven't already for numerous belly laughs, if you don't mind the film's depravity. Will Ferrell even has a small role in this, but I won't tell you who he plays. Grade: B (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 7/15/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

The plan almost never fails, until they decide to try and pull off the crash of a lifetime and one of them ends up developing genuine feelings for his prospective target.

"algorinch","7","0","1","12 August 2005"," Wedding Crashers
","The Frat-Pack, are surely the hardest working collective in Hollywood. Hardly a month goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released.<br/><br/>When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodgeball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but ""Wedding Crashers"" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.<br/><br/>Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. In ""Wedding Crashers"", John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn), are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food.. and of course score with girls.<br/><br/>They have a strict 'crashers rulebook', which dictates the etiquette of the pick-up, such as 'never use your real name'. It also suggests, by behaving raucously, loudly and generally being the life-and-soul, people will think you're so obnoxious, you can't not have been invited.<br/><br/>The pair eventually find themselves at odds with each other when John meets and falls for a bridesmaid at the Washington society wedding of the year.<br/><br/>Although ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com cliché. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former ""Home and Away"" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.<br/><br/>I admit ""Wedding Crashers"" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fiancée Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.<br/><br/>But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film."

Owen Wilson and his partner fit well together in this movie, and other great cast include Jayne Seymour and Christopher Walken. The story to me is original, I have at least never heard of the concept of visiting weddings uninvited just to pick up gals, but the idea makes us all a bit jealous just about why we don't have the guts ourselves to do the same and join in the fun! Ever since Armageddon I am a fan of Owen Wilson, and he didn't disappoint me in the great remake comedy of Starsky & Hutch (the best comedy of 2004). He did it again with this flick, probably the best comedy of this year! Enjoy!"

","Upon the recommendations of some friends, I decided to go see the newest film by the Frat Pack of Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, and Jack Black. It was exactly what I expected. Vince Vaughn in the fast-talking, quick quipping role and Owen Wilson as the main character whose character has heart and falls in love. Let me just say that it was hilarious. It is by far the funniest movie I have seen this year. If you enjoy the raunchy, sex-based humor of Old School or Animal House, then this is definitely your kind of movie. I give Wedding Crashers an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>So, on to the review. It starts out like you see in the trailers of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson crashing weddings and profiting quite well from it. They use the emotions of women against them to get them into bed. I said the movie was funny, not virtuous. You get back story that the two of them have been doing this for years and Owen Wilson finally feels that he wants more than just the sex they have been finding at these receptions. And coincidentally, at the final wedding of the year, Wilson finds someone who he wants more with than just a fling. Both characters are lovable in their own ways, and both actors are great in the roles. But, they are not the only actors who shine in this movie. The counterparts of Vaughn and Wilson are Isla Fisher, and Rachel McAdams respectively. They both do a great job. Fisher in the crazy nymphomaniac role, and McAdams as the lovable girl who Wilson falls in love with. Hilarity ensues. Also, there is Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour as the parents of the girls. Christopher Walken has that always scary, deadpan wit that has made him famous. And Seymour in the typical movie role of the older woman who constantly has been unfaithful to her husband. There is also a cameo by another member of the frat pack, but I won't let that cat out of the bag so you can enjoy it in its entirety when it happens. Now, on the moral side of the fence, there is a lot of language, sexual situations, and nudity. So if you are going in for a family film, then you don't even need to be there. But I would think that anyone who goes to this movie knows what they are in for. The movie is hilarious, and I would highly recommend that, if you like the other movies of the same genre, then you see this one. It was my favorite so far out of their movies. Even funnier than Old School. I heard it was funnier than Dumb and Dumber. I was disappointed that it wasn't quite to that caliber, but it was a different type of movie that relied more on storyline than just sight gags. I see this group's movies as the new National Lampoon's movies. It seems that they have taken the spot of Animal House, Vacation, and Van Wilder. It seems to me that they are taking the place of them, and doing it quite well. Just go see the movie, sit back, and enjoy. Like I said, I give Wedding Crashers an 8 out of 10."
"mhoney-1","9","0","3","12 August 2005"," Even funnier than I expected
","I'd heard this was a funny movie. I expected it to be funny. But I didn't expect it to be THIS funny! Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn headline a cast in what must be one of the absolute funniest movies I've seen in years. Part of the comic team that started out with ""Zoolander"" and later the VERY successful ""Old School,"" among others, this is better than both. While movies like those, ""Starsky & Hutch,"" etc. ended up relying quite heavily on the crude and outright disgusting, this movie forgoes much of that in favor of genuine laughs.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn hearkens back to the over-the-top antics he first displayed in the cult hit ""Swingers,"" while, perhaps for the first time, Wilson manages not to irritate me (okay, I'll admit Wes Anderson knows how to use him too). Together they generate enough laughs to sustain the picture by themselves. But luckily they are given a terrific supporting cast to help them on their way.<br/><br/>As mediators for couples in divorce settlements, they prove their effectiveness in the first scene, where they disturb separated spouses Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca De Mornay to the point that they want to settle just so these two don't have to talk anymore.<br/><br/>These guys do everything together, and they have for the last seventeen years. It is the most homo-erotic relationship between two heterosexual men to be shown in quite some time. The whole movie, they are after women, but it is their bond that holds things together. It has gotten so Jeremy (Vaughn) has promised, in keeping with tradition, never to let John (Wilson) spend his birthday alone, since the only child's parents are dead. And, as the title implies, every year they head to weddings looking for women to bed. They also make quite a scene at every wedding, assisting with the cutting of the cake, and making speeches to the bride and groom.<br/><br/>But then comes the ""Kentucky Durby of weddings,"" Treasury Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) is walking his oldest daughter down the aisle. The scene features walk-ons by Sen. John McCain and James Carville. The two buddies go in as ""brothers from New Hampshire,"" and things spiral out of control. John sets his sights for Claire Cleary, (Rachel McAdams), the middle child who is dating a selfish environmental lobbyist (Bradley Cooper, of ""Alias"" fame). Jeremy, who just wants to stick to the plan of the one-night stand, becomes the object of obsessive deflowered virgin Gloria Cleary (Ilsa Fisher, giving perhaps the most energetic performance of the film), not to mention the secretary's gay son, Todd. Mrs. Cleary (Jane Seymour) attempts to seduce John in a rather humiliating scene reminiscent of ""The Graduate."" Another hilarious addition is the secretary's foul-mouthed mother, who describes First-Lady Eleanor Roosevelt as being a dyke. Henry Gibson, as the meek Father is also a pleasure, not so much for what he says (since he has very few lines) but what he doesn't say, including listening to Vaughn give confession, ending with a mouth-to-mouth kiss to seal the deal.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Fisher are a perfect romantic pair, because each one is just as crazy as the other, and as determined as she is to screw him, he's just as determined to keep away. Owen Wilson, more subdued than his co-star, actually shows a depth heretofore unseen in his character. Will Ferrell has an uncredited cameo as the entrepreneur who taught Vaughn how to crash weddings, a momma's boy who now gets his kicks crashing funerals.<br/><br/>The references to bodily organs, sex, etc. are all fairly relevant in the context of the story, and not overdone. It's crude, but unlike ""Old School,"" stuff isn't just thrown in there because the writers couldn't think of anything genuinely funny to say."

","That is the only way to describe the opening sequence of WEDDING CRASHERS, the newly minted first-time pairing of comedy tyros Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson, as it attempts to clear its biggest hurdle: making palatable the unsavory premise of two overgrown fratboys with only one thing in mind--infiltrating weddings to eat, drink, be merry, and put the make ON ""Mary""...and June and Lisa and Jennifer and any other bridesmaids unlucky or naive enough to fall into their clutches.<br/><br/>Thanks to the irresistible laid-back charms of Wilson and the hysterically sharp improv-riffing skills of Vaughan, that hurdle is pretty much cleared. It's a good thing, too, because without two likable leads, the entire movie would've fallen apart like a soufflé in an oven where somebody slammed the door before it had a chance to rise.<br/><br/>Vaughan and Wilson's marital mediators-turned-marital opportunists Jeremy Gray and John Beckwith, respectively, have honed their reception-razing skills to a science, guaranteeing them a never-ending supply of nosh and 'nookie' on a Dionysan scale. But then they get greedy about it, and the wedding cake truly hits the fan.<br/><br/>Toward the end of one long streak of successful crashes, (that opening montage), Jeremy decides that they should set their sites on the Crown Jewel of weddings: the impending nuptials of the eldest daughter of Secretary of the Treasury Cleary (Christopher Walken). Getting in will prove to be a whole lot easier than getting out for the two lotharios, as they met their matches in the indomitable Cleary sisters...as John falls head over heels for the beautiful Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy gets literally taken by the goofily predatory Gloria Cleary, (the sublime newcomer Isla Fisher.) The bulk of the comedy comes from the politically-incorrect and scatological humor that unfolds from increasingly uncomfortable situations, arising from the boys' deepening involvement with the not-so-normal Cleary family, including the obligatory potty-mouthed grandmother (Ellen Albertini Dow), the soused nymphomaniac spouse (Jane Seymour cast well against type) and the steroidally homicidal fiancée of Claire (Bradley Cooper).<br/><br/>Seekers of more 'refined' adult entertainment, consider yourself warned well in advance: if you weren't enamored by the charms of such comedies as ""American Pie"" or ""There's Something About Mary,"" you won't find a lot here to tickle your fancy.<br/><br/>Having said that, let me add that for what it is, director David Dobkin has done an admirable job. As a matter of fact, Dobkin seems to be the only director who knows how to tap into Vaughan's manic energy and Wilson's surfer-dude vibe to maximum positive effect, (he directed Vaughan in the underrated black comedy CLAY PIGEONS, and Wilson in the SHANGHAI NOON/KNIGHTS franchise). Though it stretches on for the better part of two hours, it achieves its goal of leaving its target audience thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned before, however, when Dobkin and screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher make the choice to try and inject ""meaningful dramatic weight"" into the jokey proceedings, the whole thing nearly comes to a screeching halt. The faux pas is somewhat redeemed by the special guest appearance of a certain SNL alum, (but I won't spoil the surprise by telling you who it is.) That does jump-start things back to life, but the character the guest plays is so much skeevier than Our Heroes were at their worst behavior, that it threatens to take a detour into some extremely uncomfortable territory. (Which is saying something after jokes about masturbation, prodigious vomiting, bondage, posterior shotgun wounds and other delights.) Thankfully, before WEDDING CRASHERS can crash, it is well into the third act, which ends on an agreeable note, and a lot less predictably than I expected.<br/><br/>Hardly the bottom of the barrel in the annals of low comedy, (that prize would have to be awarded to the likes of FREDDY GOT FINGERED), WEDDING CRASHERS is great for a hysterically funny evening soon-to-be-forgotten with the half empty large soda and popcorn boxes.<br/><br/>What we will hope to see more of is the pairing of Vaughan and Wilson again, hopefully under the direction of Dobkin, with a much more ""acceptable"" comedic premise to more of the mass audience.<br/><br/>And let's not forget two of the brightest spots in this comedy: Isla Fisher, whose overcaffeinated gift for physical comedy matches Vaughan's scene-for-scene (and LITERALLY 'stroke-for-stroke') and the beautiful Rachel McAdams, whose star is rapidly rising (she will soon be seen as the damsel-in-distress-du-jour in Wes Craven's latest terror-opus, RED-EYE, opposite 28 DAYS LATER'S Cillian Murphy)."

","Every once in a while, a movie lives up to it's hype. Or in this case, word of mouth. I can't remember the last time every person who saw a certain movie said, ""You have to go see this."" Wedding Crashers breaks that barrier, in that it IS that good! It is a throwback to the raunchy comedies of the late 70's and early 80's (yes folks, it belongs with Animal House, Caddyshack, Vacation, etc...), in that there is no pretense of avoiding offending such touchy subjects as race, date rape, sexual orientation, men looking at women as conquests. But it succeeds in that it does not go over the top into pure sleaze, but walks a fine line teetering on tasteless at times, but always hilarious. The film is driven by the leads, Vaughn and Wilson. Out of all the so-called ""frat-pack"" film pairings, this one nails it. Vaughn's infamous rat-a-tat-tat deliveries, mixed with Wilson's laid back approach, makes for some of the most memorable moments and quotes in Hollywood's long and storied past. This isn't a bunch of teens running around looking for tail, and getting into uncanny predicaments. It's 2 thirty-somethings doing it! The plot takes a back seat to the events that unfold, but when they do, the next thing you know you are laughing so much that you don't want it to end. I have to go see the film again, for I probably missed a few good lines since the laughter was so loud in the theater. Now, ask yourself. When's the last time you were able to say that? Not only 10 out of 10. But a pre-order, uncut(hopefully!) DVD order as well. A true can't miss film."

It was delivered so well, that it went from raunchy to just plain funny. Of course the rest of the cast was great too. Rachel McAdams is fantastic, and Christopher Walken is equally as funny.

","Oh yeah? Folks don't come any sleazier and laughing about it isn't even embarrassing, given the fact they're so darn funny. The interaction between Jeremy and John (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) reminds me of the one between Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in ""The Producers."" The latter fellows display an easily bent conscience that the former guys know how to twist into all sorts of shapes. The audience identifies with the shy, more honest, and slightly hesitant Wilson/Wilder character, but secretly is rooting for the gutsy lead man.<br/><br/>This movie is funny because one expects the characters to act or react one way, and they don't. The effect is surprise and hilarity. This film is full of balloon bicycles. <br/><br/>I had never seen Vince Vaughn before and was delighted to ""discover"" him. I love Jim Belushi and he certainly is the same personality- not a person to cross, but restrained by self interest and somewhere deep within, gentleness.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that the movie is a bit too long. The funeral part seemed tacked on and out of sync. It broke the flow of the story and characters.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to wait and see ""The Wedding Crashers"" when you are really feeling down. Guaranteed, it is better than Paxil and it works faster!"

The two of them create elaborate back stories, study the families in the weddings and then crash them with these stories in hopes of scoring vulnerable, and hot women which they successfully do again and again and again. John Beckwith, one half of the two friends, is starting to grow weary of their philandering ways. He feels like he needs a break but Jeremy wants to pull the Wedding crash of all weddings. Secretary of treasury's daughter is getting married, and it's going to be the most elaborate wedding of all time. Finally John gives in and the two go posing as brothers. While at the wedding Jeremy picks out the brides sister as his mark and John immediately notices the other sister, the beautiful Claire Clearly. While Jeremy makes his move John makes his way to Claire and the two hit it off almost immediately. Unfortunately eventually she introduces him to her wealthy, well to do, long time boyfriend Sack. This doesn't get John down, instead he is determined to win her away from Sack. Jeremy's woman is turning out to be a psychotic clingy, obsessive woman and he's ready to bail but John is insisting they stay around for him to get more time with Claire. Jeremy's newfound girlfriend Gloria Cleary invites them both to her father's home for a weekend away and Jeremy tries to say no but John thinks it's great seeing the opportunity to get near Claire. The two men go and what follows is a roller coaster for Jeremy of trying to avoid Gloria and her crazy, very gay, artsy, rather slow brother Todd. Meanwhile John is falling hard for Claire and Sack is only showing more and more why he doesn't deserve her. Sack sees John trying to vie for his woman and he sets an investigation in motion to find out who they really are. Once their secret is uncovered John thinks he's lost Claire forever but true love will always prevail for both men.<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers is the furthest thing from original. It's not a new story or plot or characters for the most part but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are spectacular together and apart in this film. Owen Wilson plays the straight man to Vaughns neurotic over the top hilarious role. Vaughns expressions and one-liners are enough to keep the whole moving going. Not to mention the HUGE physical comedy he does that is just great!! Isla Fisher as Vaughn's obsessive girlfriend is hilarious although the commercials and trailers for this film kind of ruin most of her biggest comedy lines. Christopher Walken who has been known to do some great comedy is more of the straight man in the film but still a great presence to have on screen. Jane Seymour's role could have been better used and she's barely got any screen time. The hilarious Ellen Albertini Dow who plays Grandma Cleary gets most of her lines from being outrageous but still hilarious!! And the usually rather plain looking Rachel McAdams, is stunning and perfectly matched with Owen Wilson. Despite being a rather touchy comedic film for those who are not sensitive you will probably laugh to tears. I definitely laughed all the way through just not as much as I wanted to. I guess you have to be in the right mood for it. I admit I was disappointed when they entered in special guest and ANNOYING cameo Will Ferrell...another member of the Ferrell comedy troupe. I had hoped that Vaughn and Wilson were trying to break free of the crew but apparently they are still attached. Ferrell makes an appearance as THEE original Wedding Crasher Chaz Reingold. As always he has some amusing lines but completely over acts and almost ruins much of the humor built up in the film. Wedding Crashers is a can't miss comedy that is sure to at least give you several laughs. A little raunchy at times but funny!! 8.5/10"

","I have to say I left the theater loving Vince. Some parts of this movie could've been better but for the most part it was good. Vince and Owen make a great team. I think they fit together really well and the casting was great. There was a lot of laughing going on at the theater and the 2 people I was with thought it was a pretty good movie as well. After watching a HORRIBLE movie like The Dukes Of Hazard this movie took the horrible memories away. Great movie for a girls night out. I look forward to seeing a lot more of Vince in the future. Next time you go to a wedding you'll be looking for those guest that no one knows and wondering are they wedding crashers? LOL."

","The chemistry and interplay between the two lead actors is brilliant and makes the Wedding Crashers a comedy classic. I will say I discovered Owen Wilson in this movie which has got to be his best turn. The same can be said for Vince Vaughn who is the hottest talent around period let alone this project. Lots of credit should go to the Director, great writers, and a superb supporting cast all of which helped to make this such a witty and entertaining showcase.<br/><br/>The premise is well known by now and sure it could get somewhat predictable at a certain point, but what movie doesn't? There is a Hollywood formula that runs rampant in all motion pictures, this one is no different. However, you will certainly see enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes so to speak. I give it a 10 for sheer entertainment value alone, there is no competition for this movie - the hit of the summer bar none.<br/><br/>I was not going to submit a review for this film but was compelled to after seeing it bashed one time too many and for no reason. This is a lighthearted and funny film, easy to watch. See the movie for what it was designed to do, make people laughand that it did and some, believe me - its such a riot. We were rolling in our seats at this timeless classic."

I also was very glad to see that Will Farrell only had a small part and luckily he was perfect for the part. I was surprised to see Jane Seymour in the movie, but she was good. Christopher Walken was his normal strange self so he made the movie very enjoyable. Yes, Claire's boyfriend was Bradley Cooper (Will from Alias) and it was soo much fun to see him get his butt kicked. I can't wait for the unrated DVD to come out. Everyone over the age of about 16 should see this in the theater. This movie will become a classic. Rachel Mc Adams is soo pretty and a good actress.

"QueenMakeda84","8","0","3","3 August 2005"," Really Well-Planned
","This movie really hid a lot of its good points. They really didn't advertise Will Ferrell in this film, and he was hilarious in a sad pathetic way. You wondered what dumb girl fell for him, but you just went with it and whispered to yourself, the heffa deserved it if she could fall that loser. More to the point, the film just didn't seem that funny from the trailers. I was begged to see it and walked out laughing and more determined to create a site with memorable lines from films I've seen. Wilson and Vaughn have a great chemistry that can't be denied. You just didn't see a lot of the humorous moments coming, which is important in a funny film. Everyone played their parts extremely well, but I'm confused about Jane Seymour's ""Touch them and see if they're real"" moment. I thought that was going to be explained, but it never was. It never even came up again and you just wondered, why did we just see that? Awkward...<br/><br/>The guy who played the ""homo"" brother, according to granny, was just weird, lol. He had his face and posture in a perpetual seizure as if epilepsy was a part of his life. I didn't think it was necessary for him to stand out, but you noticed him a little more. The over-competitiveness of that reject boyfriend and the rest of the psycho-Brady Bunch was another humorous note. It was like watching an illegal American Eagle commercial with the light colored plaids and solid stripes. I felt lost and wondering what the hell was going on? Rachel just didn't sell me. The hair color was just wrong for her first off. It looked like a wig, but you knew it was her hair. I would recommend a black hairstylist. We know how to blend baby girl. However, beyond that, I felt that she was playing a character very much similar to the one she played in ""The Notebook"" as Allison Hamilton. It was just a more modern time. You don't get the appeal about her for Owen and she's not doing anything different than she did in that movie. She's the rich girl who doesn't quite like her lifestyle, so is amused by us lesser mortals. And why the over-exaggerated sense of her community involvement? Come on. Who in college still knows non-profit organizations like Greek-letter ones? Her character just didn't make any sense, but you could tell they just had to make her ""different"". No, she was as eccentric as that mad-cap family.<br/><br/>The period where Owen plunges into utter despair at the loss of Claire (and the alliterative/rhyming last name was a bit over the top, just a bit!) was like, huh? I thought this film was supposed to be funny. It was unneeded and unsightly. We could've gotten the point with him walking around looking longingly at other couples. It made the film longer and took it on an awkward turn toward melodrama and sincerity. All in all, the film was funny. It's really sad if people do this. I kept wondering throughout the initial segments of the film where it showed their wedding crashing montages if they'd try a black wedding. I didn't think their ruse would play out too well there. But, I wanted them to try just for the amusement factor of them being disassembled before being thrown out. Oh, we don't play with that kinda wedding crasher nonsense, lol. Do take a gander at the film. It was surprisingly funny and charming."
"galahad58","7","0","1","2 August 2005"," Crash Landing
","Earlier reviews tell enough about the ""Wedding Crashers"" story that I will skip the summary and just dive right into my thoughts and commentary: The Wedding Crashers is a very good comedy. There are some moments of adult sexual humor, so do not take the kiddies to see this movie. Wedding Crashers is a fun movie with a great deal of laughs. Vince Vaughn is excellent as Jeremy Grey. This is Vaughn premiere role and well worth seeing. The other spectacular performance is by Isla Fisher. Isla Fisher is extraordinary as Gloria Cleary. If Marisa Tomei can win an Oscar from her average performance in ""My Cousin Vinny, then Isla Fisher deserves an Oscar for her comedic role in the Wedding Crashers. Yes, she is that good. Fisher steals each and every scene she is in. She devours her role and sinks her teeth into every line that she delivers. Vaughn and Fisher are the reasons to see this movie and both are worth the admission price. As for Wilson and McAdams: they are there and fulfill the require roles. But as the two main characters, they are severely lacking compared to Jeremy and Gloria."

","VINCE VAUGHN and Owen Wilson. Had to watch it. Now, Vince was a pretty serious actor sometime back, remember Psycho and the cell. OK, maybe the movies sucked, but the guy was good in serious roles. He didn't have to go out and prove he could do comedy too!! BUT, man am I glad he did. HILARIOUS! ! That's the word for Vince from now on. Owen Wilson, how come he tags along with others in comedies. Ook, Vince tagged with Ben Stiller in Dodgeball. Hmm.. you think, Ben Stiller is the tagger. WHO CARES, all these guys give us such good laughs.I wish that Mike Myers would go back to making movies with real people in it.<br/><br/>Shrek 3!! I heard they were going to make a 4th one too. (Justin Timberlake is King Arthur in Shrek 3!! YUCK!! I'm still gonna watch it) Wedding Crashers, 2 horny, pathetic, losers, who crash weddings to bed the single women there. That in itself, had me laughing for the first 15 minutes. Oh, but wait, one of them, Owen, starts having second thoughts about the whole thing. Go for one last wedding of the season, and bam, Owen falls for the prettiest gal there.<br/><br/>Oh yea, Rachel McAdams, the girl no one can stop raving about, just looks DARN beautiful in the movie and thats about the extent of her role.<br/><br/>AND surprise, we have another comedian in the house people, I had no idea, he was in this. WILL FERRELL, his entrance: emerging from the shadows of his mom's house, wearing a nunchuk around his neck, ""da fuk dYU want?"" I could go on, but I still can't stop laughing. VINCE VAUGHN cracked me up. I Can't wait for his next movie. Who cares for serious movies, with a cinema and which leaves the audience with some powerful questions to deal with. Give me an R rated comedy with Vince Vaughn in it any day.<br/><br/>Somehow, I have this dreadful feeling about movies, here it comes, I think they're going to make a trilogy out of this one.<br/><br/>Funerals???

","John (Owen Wilson) & Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are best buds. They've known each other for 17 years, work together, and in there spare time crash wedding parties; where they drink like sailors, mingle with unsuspecting relatives, and hit on single and willing brides maids every chance they get. They have a whole science to their crashing ( rules and all), and have become quite adept at the sport.<br/><br/>That all changes when they attend a wedding by Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken), whose daughter is getting hitched. During the lavish formal affair, Jeremy makes head way with Cleary's physcopath daughter Gloria ( a hilarious Isla Fisher), while John slowly maneuvers his way into the life of the secretary other daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), who just happens to have a steady bo' of her own.<br/><br/>Eventually, after all the formalities-- the two are invited privately back to the Secretary's estate, where they play touch football with the family, have formal dinners, sail out on the boat, get hit on by the Secretary sex starved wife (Jane Seymour) and homosexual son Todd (Keir O'Donnell).<br/><br/>Its all pretty funny and silly- but the great chemistry by Wilson and Vaughn helps the film move at a steady pace. The supporting roles of McAdams and Fishler are nicely fleshed out as well. While no means a great movie, ""The Wedding Crashers"" is quite funny at times, and overall enjoyable.<br/><br/>Some people have called this comedy raunchy- and a gross-out comedy, although I noticed none of the above. Besides the dialogue and a few breast shots, there's really nothing raunchy or gross-out at all. It certainly wouldn't fall into the category of ""American Pie"" movies or even ""Something About Mary"".<br/><br/>Vaughn and Wilson definitely shine throughout and appear to be having the time of their lives here....<br/><br/>Recommended."
"americanwerewolf","4","0","1","1 August 2005"," Erratic movie, but somewhat funny
","I just saw ""Wedding Crashers"" tonight, and was told by all that it would be hilarious from start to finish. And I do admit that there were some parts that were done especially well (See: Vince Vaughn's attempt to clear the air about his and Owen Wilson's background at the dinner table while his nympho girlfriend gives him an exciting under-the-table reminder about exactly why she's a nympho). Vaughn does do a good job of being the victim of events that you sometimes see coming, and other times not). For its handful of hilarious scenes, though, ""Crashers"" is filled with tons of setups for jokes that never actually deliver the punchlines. For example, Christopher Walken, as the U.S. Secretary of Treasury and the father of the two girls Vaughn and Wilson attempt to bed, has a potentially funny scene where he stares down Vaughn to remind of who wears the pants in the family, but that's the last we hear of it. The director could have at least inserted that joke several more times so it would have gotten a chuckle. I was also told ahead of time that the romantic scenes between Wilson and Rachel MacAdams weigh the film down. While they may be a bit too dramatic for a movie involving the Frat Pack, they're not nearly as laboring as the confusion you'll have trying to decide what type of character Wilson is. He hardly says anything funny in the film, and you'll spend the entire movie wondering if he's a genuinely nice, sweet guy or a sleaze ball who falls in love. Fellow Frat-packer Will Ferrell, who also makes an inevitable cameo in the film, probably would have been more suitable in the role of Vaughn, and then Vaughn could have taken Wilson's place. Oh well, that's just me I guess. If you want to laugh, you could see this movie, but by the end, you won't be sure you got your money's worth."

Wedding Season, is a span of a few weeks when most people get married. These two best friends go to Weddings pretending to be part of the grooms or brides family, but what they really do is pick up girls. This goes well for a while, before they go to Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken)'s wedding.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie 7 out of 10 because it was a funny movie and the writing and directing was amazing!"
"jberlin11797","7","0","1","31 July 2005"," Crash This Wedding
","""The Wedding Crashers"" has all the elements of a ""Frat Pack"" comedy. It stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in the leads, and has a cameo by Will Ferrell near the end of this funny flick. There are plenty of ""gross out"" jokes that will leave you laughing, if you have this sense of humor. All that is missing is Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>Vaughn and Wilson are John Beckwith and Jeremy Klein, two carefree Washington-based womanizing divorce mediators who meet and bed with young women at every ethnic wedding in town that they aren't invited to - Jewish, Italian, Irish, Indian, etc. Surprisingly, they are the most sought-after guests that women and children take to (in fact, one difficult boy stubbornly demands Jeremy to make a bike out of balloons). These guys lie and cheat their ways at weddings to get the girls they want.<br/><br/>Then it's the big social event of the year. One of the daughters of Treasury Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken, once again in one of his ""eccentric"" roles every director demands him to play) and his slinky 50ish wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour, who displays middle-aged sexuality and keeps her modesty, in an implied nude scene with Owen Wilson later on) is getting married. They crash this wedding. Then they are invited by the sisters of the bride, Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher) to their Cape Cod house for the weekend. Claire is engaged to hunk Sack, who has such a violent streak he knocks down Jeremy so hard when they play football. But John has a liking for Claire, and then gets her at the end of the movie. Gloria falls for Jeremy. The faithless Kathleen (""Call me Kat"") wants John to fondle her breasts. As Kathleen, it would appear that Jane Seymour told the director not to display her breasts, just the top part, and then when it came to the breasts, Owen Wilson would block them with his hands covering them completely. The younger actresses boldly get the full frontal nudity, as in the case of the more comfortable Isla Fisher tying up Vince Vaughn. Also, the Clearys have a brother named Todd (Keir O'Donnell), a gay young man who falls for Jeremy. Then, there is a foul-mouthed grandmother played by Ellen Albertini Dow, the elderly rapster from Adam Sandler's ""Wedding Singer"" and now in ""The Wedding Crasher,"" providing her comic relief. Ms. Dow is a spunky old lady who loves a riotous wedding.<br/><br/>This is the laugh-riot of the summer. Will Ferrell gives his support as Chaz the funeral crasher who falls for young, crying babes and gets both mushy and horny wherever he goes. Henry Gibson has never lost his deadpan ""Laugh-In"" style as the reverend for the Clearys' weddings. Wilson, Vaughn, Walken, Seymour, et al, display their talents at what they do best - seductive, eccentric, and very funny in their comic roles. The film is very reminiscent of ""There's Something About Mary,"" which also came out on July 15th seven years before. Both movies have sex, foul language, and dirty jokes throughout. And ""The Wedding Crashers"" is the biggest and best film of the summer of 2005, where most of the other movies (the needless remakes, for instance) make up a movie junkyard this season, which explains the Hollywood slump."

Almost every line out of his mouth sends the audience into huge belly laughs.<br/><br/>I'd love to say more, but I don't like making reviews that contains spoilers.<br/><br/>My Recommendation?

If you like movies like Old School, Anchorman, Meet the Parents, etc. you will love this movie, it might be the best of them all.<br/><br/>I do have a question for those who have seen the movie one or more times already.

"Mouldyman","8","0","3","20 July 2005"," Wilson and Vaughn attack the script with the subtlety of a steamroller, but ultimately it is very funny
","Wilson and Vaughn play two wedding crashers- going to weddings uninvited in order to pick up women. Just as Wilson's character is tiring of the life which he is increasingly viewing as sleazy (cue montage of topless women falling onto beds), they pull off the ultimate crash- the Cleary wedding, Wilson becomes infatuated with Claire Geary (Rachael McAdams)...with hilarious results!<br/><br/>It's far from a perfect film. There are many scenes which are simply unnecessary, and contain no jokes or plot development. It had a tendency to vacillate between the silly humour we've come to expect, to sweet love scenes and lingering meaningful looks between the leads. Too many meaningful looks. Please, we're not stupid, we've realised they fancy each other but she can't overcome her inertia. WE GET THE IDEA!! please stop the doe eyes and mooning glances! <br/><br/>Wilson and Vaughn attack the script with sledgehammers, there's no subtlety to their performance. Vaughn's character is inconsistent, and Wilson is wasted as he forgoes his usual shine for the tortured lovestruck eye acting which wastes everyone's time. I'm not joking, if anyone spent that much time staring at me, i'd think they were some kind of psycho.<br/><br/>However, there are some genuinely funny ideas in the script, there are parts which really shine (Vaughn in the bed), and some very funny lines which redeem the film. And Will Ferrell. He steals the whole movie, and he's only in 2 or 3 scenes. How anyone can make the word 'meatloaf' so amusing is incredible.<br/><br/>Also does have it's romantic tones, while I complain these make the film erratic and patchy, these may be the parts which other people enjoy the most. Girlfriends who may not enjoy the Wilson/Ferrel/Vaughn style of humour may enjoy the romantic aspects which do have some quite poignant moments and lines.<br/><br/>In short, I liked the film, I enjoyed it. It's certainly not the best film of the year, but it is entertaining (for a little too long at 2 hours perhaps). I'd recommend other people to see it but I'd also recommend they don't expect anything mindblowing.<br/><br/>I'd also like to launch a personal attack on the two leads. The end of Wilson's nose is all wonky. During the climatic scene I could only stare at his wonky nose, it's so distracting. And Vaughn looked absolutely knackered all the way through. Get some sleep man, I'm sure the producers will understand, you look half dead! I kept thinking, 'you'll never get any of those women looking like that, you've clearly not thought this plan through' But that's largely irrelevant to the actual quality of the film."

","This was a decent enough movie. I enjoyed the characters quite a bit. Not VERY, VERY funny though. Good story, the wedding crasher theme IS a really good plot thread. There is a nice montage with the guys getting with all of their different women, including nudity (on the part of the women) which is something you don't see too much anymore in today's PG-13 rated world. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are true to their normal character patterns talking up a storm in their meandering-but-oh-so-enjoyable way. I DID enjoy this movie, but it would have been even better if it had more funny parts. Walt D in LV. 07/18/05. waltcd@yahoo.com"

","Wedding Crashers...a very funny film that just could have been better. I'm not a big comedy fan. I only saw this because I was able to see it for free. It has two good and pretty funny actors in it, and I will say they did very well together. The story of two guys crashing weddings for the free food, drinks, and girls--one of them ends up falling for a political figure's daughter and the other strangely falls for the sister. This seems like a pretty good story for a romantic comedy. And it is for a while. The whole movie provides the audience with laughter, which of course was a very good thing. It was the relieving factor here. I just did not like how I did not care about what happened to any of the characters, especially during the middle half. They made pretty messed up decisions and I was beginning to get tired. But I'm sure not many people are going to care about that. This is a comedy, not a drama. It is supposed to be fun and it is. I guess it just becomes a little too drab, and I just did not care how it finished. A lot of you will like this though. The movie is entertaining for a while, but as I said before, it then crashes toward the end. And if you are concerned with sexual content, there is plenty of it mainly in the dialogue and brief nudity. That is about it. If you are a fan of comedies or any of the actors, you will have a good time with these crashers =) <br/><br/>6.2/10 Stars"
