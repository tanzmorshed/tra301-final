","I'm finding it hard to see why this film has taken such a tongue lashing (or keyboard lashing) by some people...<br/><br/>mostly it is said that the main character is selfish and self indulgent, and that this film builds him up to be some kind of hero..<br/><br/>but I think that's missing the point...<br/><br/>through-out I was thinking about how, on one hand it was admirable that he wanted to break from the materialistic, money grabbing oppressive shackles placed on us by modern society, but on the other, how he had gone about it in such an irresponsible, hurtful and self-righteous way...<br/><br/>the way he abandoned his parents and loving sister without a phone call note or explanation, and from the people he met along the way, like the kind old man and young romance, especially compounded this...<br/><br/>and ultimately he realised this at the end by scribbling into a book, ""happiness only real when shared"" surely that is the lesson here! that his selfish, hurtful adolescent behaviour was wrong, and he ultimately paid a terrible cost.<br/><br/>So ignore that haters...they are looking at this story the wrong way! Very much worth an open minded viewing!"
"dinglis-2","10","686","909","10 September 2007"," Real American Beauty - an exceptional movie
","I've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.<br/><br/>This is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.<br/><br/>The feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.<br/><br/>What it reminded me of...<br/><br/><ul><li>Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold &amp; Maude...) - even a bit of Ken Loach</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ruby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider</li></ul><br/><br/>... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was ""too long"" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.<br/><br/>Hal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.<br/><br/>The film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic."
"jaredmobarak","9","430","590","16 September 2007"," TIFF07, review 3: Facing the blind deaf stone aloneInto the Wild
","Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.<br/><br/>All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.<br/><br/>Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God."
"trigger_jam","10","354","484","8 October 2007"," Justice done.
","The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","124","167","21 July 2009"," Beautiful Film, Even Better Than The Book
","For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.<br/><br/>Sean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can't stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he's great as a director, having seen his work in ""The Pledge"" and ""The Crossing Guard."" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays ""Chris McCandless"" (a.k.a. ""Alexander Supertramp"" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.<br/><br/>Two people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (""Ron France"") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn't acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as ""Tracy Tatro,"" who had a crush on ""Alex."" This young woman is on her way to stardom.<br/><br/>Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, ""Rainey"" and ""Jan."" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker's voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.<br/><br/>Knowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don't remember them in the book but I'll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it's a a fascinating story and a beautiful film."
"shark-43","10","197","278","24 October 2007"," Sneaks Up On You
","INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker with each movie he makes."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","502","732","7 December 2007"," Blind hero-worship of an idiot (spoilers)
","Christopher McCandless lived a silly life and died a silly death. Here was a guy who gave his savings to Oxfam, left home without uttering a word to his family and who thought salvation lay in the wilderness. Too bad, then, that he ate the wrong type of plant and carked it.<br/><br/>All the time we're told what complete bastards McCandless' parents are. They drove Christopher into the wild. But what was their crime? Apparently they argued some, even lied a little and their children were born out of wedlock. Okay, they're not the best parents in the world, but do they deserve the harsh treatment that their son dishes out  no letters, no postcards, no phone calls? <br/><br/>Well, if you're a massive jerk and you're somehow unable to comprehend that human relationships are more complicated than a simple 'they're good' or 'they're bad', then you may be able to build a case for young Christopher, but if you have any depth of feeling in your soul, you may well think that McCandless punished his parents beyond anything that is reasonable. And also remember that he never contacted his beloved sister. She got the silent treatment as well. However, we have a scene where Christopher goes to call her, but instead he gives his quarter to an old man who is running out of change. What a great guy, we're asked to think. See how he lends a helping hand to strangers. But what about his poor sister, the person who loves him most in the world? This apparently is his one feeble attempt to reach out and tell her that he's okay.<br/><br/>But no, Christopher is determined to live alone in the wilderness - to find himself. He wants to escape from a sick society where people treat each other poorly. Hell, his parents even have the nerve to offer to buy him a new car and pay for a Harvard education. Those phonies. Those shallow fakers who give him a home to live in and money to spend. How disgusting they are.<br/><br/>Okay, so fair enough, the parents that we're presented with here are stiff, middle class dweebs who are more interested in appearances than anything of any substance, but what had me shaking my head was the assertion that Christopher's disappearance made them better people. Suddenly they're thoughtful and united and in tune with one another. Yes, that's what every strained marriage needs  their children to put them through a couple of years of hell.<br/><br/>But what I find most objectionable is the romanticising of the wilderness. Is this the only way that anyone can find themselves, by opening their arms and standing on the edge of a mountain and by kayaking down a river? Isn't there any other way? Apparently not. We even get a scene where Christopher, briefly stranded in LA, looks into a restaurant populated by smarmy bastards and sees a yuppie version of himself. You see what he'd become if he stayed in the city? Hunting moose and talking to hippies is the only way to become a rounded individual.<br/><br/>But the disaffection with society in this film is incredibly adolescent. In one scene, Christopher and a buddy of his just start impotently shouting 'society!' Yeah, society sucks and the wilderness is great. The wilderness never starved anyone, ate anyone or froze their balls off. In the eyes of every bear and moose is truth and beauty, and on the cold streets of civilisation is a steady flow of lies and deceit.<br/><br/>However, at the end, Christopher maybe finally begins to understand that his quest is full of crap. He writes something along the lines that happiness is meaningless if you don't have someone to share it with. It took you all that time to figure that out? That human connections are what make life bearable? You could have found that out back home, sitting on your couch in your underpants, stuffing Cheetos down your throat.<br/><br/>But of course, it's the journey that matters, isn't it? And what a tedious journey it is. Christopher meets hippies and quirky foreigners (who are good) and men with badges (who are bad). He helps people like a shaggy-haired Littlest Hobo and enjoys the milk of human kindness. Well, he enjoys the milk of human kindness as long as the people are poor. Everyone who has no money in this film is an insightful, kind-hearted, itinerant poet. Plus none of the hippies he meets are smelly, ugly, incoherent bastards who drown in their own drug-fuelled nonsense. No, they're inspiring people, who plaster their vehicles with outdated sentiments like 'freedom', 'peace' and 'love'.<br/><br/>But it's notable that there's a moment when even a bear won't eat Christopher. Supposedly the bear turns his nose up at him because the kid stays calm or perhaps because he's so sick he doesn't smell that good. But I'd like to think that the bear turns his nose up because it's BS he can smell, and lots of it.<br/><br/>However, as we all know from Timothy Treadwell, bears don't mind a bit of BS, but alas the film can't even come close to the genius of Grizzly Man, a film that shows you're no closer to finding reality in the wilderness than you are on the city streets. The problem here is that Penn is celebrating McCandless' folly instead of investigating it. Not for one moment are we asked to consider that this kid is perhaps a bit of an idiot. We're meant to find his journey inspiring and his plight tragic. But instead it's neither of those things. And at the end his death is elevated to grandiose status (it's shot like he's ascending to heaven, that he's communing with god). But in reality his death is what happens when a deluded moron tries to live in the wilderness without a map or enough food."

","I read the book in 1996. Like others, it moved me profoundly. I created a series of prints of my interpretation of Chris. I haven't read the book since.<br/><br/>This film transported me right back to the spirit that Krakauer brought to life in the book. I spent a few years traveling alone from 1994-1996. This film reminded my why I left and why I returned. Ten years later, all grown up with all the crap, I'm haunted again by Chris. What a well done job.<br/><br/>Thank you Sean & John.

"suebasko","Null","402","611","11 September 2007"," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","One of the best movies I've ever seen. Beautiful, deep, true, adventurous, sad, occasionally funny, real, at times very touching. Based on a real-life novel, it is written and directed by Sean Penn. I have always loved the movie work of Sean Penn. Congratulations and thank you to Mr. Penn on giving me a few hours of though-provoking delight. Can you say Oscar? This movie says it loud and clear! <br/><br/>The story; Christopher McCandless, just graduated from college in the early 1990s, goes off on an adventure. He is smitten with books he readsThoreau, London, Byron. He wants no money, so he gives his to needy causes or burns it. Chris is cocky, driven, industrious. <br/><br/>He is traumatized by his parents' bad marriage. He tries to work through his anguish. He seems determined to destroy himself just to prove that he has different values than his parents. He is inconsiderate of his family and keeps them worried about his whereabouts and safety, as if a single reassuring phone call would ruin his rebellion. He fancies himself a philosopher, but acts the petulant child. It is a great credit to the film that we see these character flaws in our hero. <br/><br/>Off on the road, he makes a number of foolish choices  and suffers from some of them. Other foolish choices, such as daring to kayak a rapid river, bring him joy. He meets a lot of people and almost all are kind to him. His interactions with people are intense, the kind you have when you are planning to run off and disappear while you are still a mysterious entity. He avoids getting too close to anyone.<br/><br/>The movie is gorgeous. Mountains, plains, sky, rivers, animals. The acting is fantastic, totally believable. The actors are incredible and perfectly cast  Catherine Keener as an aging hippie vagabond, Vince Vaughn as a wacky farmer growing who knows what, William Hurt as Chris' potbellied suburbanite dad, Marcia Gay Harden as the type of mom who breeds children who wants to run off to the wilderness to escape from her. Emile Hirsch plays Chris, and does a great job of it. When an actual photo of the real Chris McCandless comes on screen, we see that Hirsch resembles him. Original songs by Eddie Vedder give the right feel  that of a well-to-do young white man heading out on a chosen adventure, getting gritty by choice. His goal is to get to Alaska, but on the way there, he hits many other states and Mexico, too.<br/><br/>Chris is a clueless kid from the warm South. He plans to go to Alaska, yet only arrives with any needed equipment because kind folks force it upon him  a machete, warm clothes, rubber boots. He's highly educated and gets good grades, yet, early on his trip, ignores a big sign that warns of flash floods. That prepares us that we are going to wince many times at his low level of common sense, while at the same time reveling in his physical strength and willingness to press on. <br/><br/>At one point, Chris passes through Los Angeles. He is dirty, hungry, tired, and goes to a downtown mission shelter. The other men there are also dirty, hungry, and tired, but not of their own choosing. It is not their adventure, it is their life. He realizes fast that he does not want to feel categorized with men who are in dire straits due to misfortune and not due to following their own adventure. <br/><br/>The movie shows Chris as an honorable young man. I do not want to give away any of the plot, so I'll just say  the young man has principles and so does the movie.<br/><br/>A few parts of the movie confused me. After Chris's college graduation, he meets h is parents at a restaurant. He brings with him a lovely young woman, obviously his date. Weirdly, it turns out that she is his sister! <br/><br/>There is more confusion when Chris picks up work on a farm run by Wayne, the Vince Vaughn character. What are they growing or doing? What's up? <br/><br/>There is an unintentionally funny scene where an old man tells Chris that he does not have time for adventures because he is too busy with leather. I thought the old guy was confessing being into whips and chaps. But no, he has a workshop where he tools leather. <br/><br/>There were a couple spots where the editing distracted from the movie. I saw a preview; maybe it was a rough cut. There's a scene on the farm where a triple screen is used  like a cheesy commercial. <br/><br/>Another scene, where Chris is eating an apple, is a series of jump cuts, which I really liked. It seemed an homage to French auteur filmmakers. But it ends with Chris mugging at the camera. With it, Sean Penn breaks the believability and acknowledges that yes, this is just us making a movie. <br/><br/>There is another part where Chris is in a car with the older man who is dropping him off. As they pull up, there is an inexplicable cutaway shot of what looks to be the head of a cannon. <br/><br/>Much of the movie is like a travel montage or music video involving mountains and sky. The scenes are so beautiful. <br/><br/>I know people that have elements of Chris in them. And I think I've met all the characters he runs into out on the road."

"tieman64","Null","9","10","21 February 2010"," A Prairie Home Companion
","Sean Penn's ""Into The Wild"" is perhaps best viewed as being part of a recent wave of eco-themed films (""Wall-E"", ""Avatar"", ""The Happening"", ""An Inconvenient Truth"", ""Grizzly Man"", ""Dreamland"", ""Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""Antichrist"", ""Day After Tomorrow"", ""Happy Feet"" etc). Most of these films urge their audiences to ""return to nature"", ""retreat to some pastoral existence"" or ""save the planet"" (without looking at the systemic or economic forces which completely undermine or neutralise such wants).<br/><br/>Interestingly, aside from ""Antichrist"", ""Grizzly Man"" and ""Into The Wild"", nature in these films is always portrayed as being some kind of mystical, ""balanced"" system. While mega-studios, quite ironically, advise us to harmonize with nature, ""smaller"" directors (Penn, Herzog, Von Trier) seem to instead posit worlds in which nature is vile and base. Nature is still portrayed as being majestic and splendid, but is then associated with asphyxiation and choking, death and rot. The only harmony – as Werner Herzog once famously said – is that of overwhelming and collective murder. <br/><br/>Murder, then, is the central theme of both ""Grizzly Man"" and ""Into The Wild"". Like Sydney Pollack's ""Jerremiah Johnson"", both films are about young men (Christopher McCandless in Penn's film, Timothy Treadwell in Herzog's) who cut themselves off from civilisation and venture off into the wilderness. Of course both Herzog and Penn initially romanticise their central characters' flights. They see beauty in this journey and a kind of crazy inner strength (McCandless rejects vapid materialism, 9 to 5 routines and sees the modern word as being a hindrance which atrophies humanity and conscience ). But both artists are also careful to counter this idealism with nature at its most violent. <br/><br/>And so both films find their heroes ""leaving civilisation"", but only because they've first suffered a total, psychological collapse. They now disbelieve in their Master Signifiers, in their Symbolic Orders, and see civilisation itself as being representative of that which is arbitrary and chaotic. Both films then end with the deaths of their central characters, McCandless killed by a lowly poisonous berry, Treadwell killed by a mighty grizzly bear. This is not romanticism: the impetus for our adventures is something sad and pathetic, even if they're absolutely right. Their problem is that they've diagnosed civilisation but idealised Nature, a fatal failing; mankind's history is a history of battling the wild outdoors. Respect Nature. Approach with caution.<br/><br/>And so both Treadwell and McCandless are portrayed as being disenchanted idealists who cut themselves off from a world they no longer feel apart of, no longer trust, no longer believe in. But while Penn romanticises Christopher's idealistic dream of ""entering the wilderness"", he is careful to counter this with nature at its most violent. Christopher hunts for food but recoils from maggots, Christopher attempts to cross a river, but nature's violent highways prove too powerful, Christopher forages for berries, but eats only poisonous weeds which ultimately kill him.<br/><br/>The result is that Penn celebrates disenchantment and urges one to disconnect (mental breakdown, oft the precursor to wisdom), even as he warns that drifting too far is itself a form of suicide or self-destruction. Chris wants to cut himself off from mankind (the film opens with a quote from the Romantic Movement which advocates ""ostracizing oneself from humanity""), but also learns that ""Happiness Is Real Only When Shared"" (the last dreams he has is of hugging his parents). And that's Penn's irony: it is the connections that Christopher makes with other people as he continues along on his journey which allowed him to survive in the wilderness for as long as he did. When towards the end of the film Christopher turns down an offer to live with an elderly man, he effectively gave up entirely on humanity. This total disconnection, this suicidal action, is ultimately what the film warns of.<br/><br/>The kind of balance that the film longs for is thus similar to the teachings of Thoreau, who advocated finding a middle ground between rejecting and fully embracing the wilderness. The people Chris meets (and rejects) along his journey are thus in possession of the life he longs for.<br/><br/>Elsewhere the film is about the enchantment of text and the romance of words. Krakauer wrote about Chris not only because Chris' journey was inspired by idealistic books (Chris takes literature rather than food with him) but because Chris was himself a writer and left behind numerous documents. What the film thus does is sets up a war between the word (fantasy) and the image (world). As each level of text is one step removed from reality, image eventually wins, the image of a berry and the failure to correctly read it being what ultimately kills Chris.<br/><br/>Audiences typically view Chris as either a ""hero"" or a ""jerk"", but he's more a lost, fragile child. Having learnt that everything he knew about his parents and his own history was a lie, Chris began to distrust everything. Suddenly all truths were shattered. The only way for Christopher's mind to cope with this subjective destitution was to then enter a little fantasy world in which he's a ""noble adventurer"". As he loves meta-acting, Penn thus has actor Emile Hirsch play Christopher as a wounded guy playing the role of the very romantic hero he reads about in books.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, like Kirk Douglas' ""Lonely Are The Brave"", Penn contrast modern technology with primitivism. He stresses the artificiality of the caravans and abandoned buses which Christopher relies on to survive, and counterpoints Christopher's physical death with a near spiritual shot of a modern passenger jet. The film does not condemn modern technology, it recognises it as a necessity. The film then ends with Christopher's body seemingly ""transcending"" into heaven. The film then rewinds, his body sucked into the ground, Penn's camera pulling back such that Christopher's corpse seems to be asphyxiated by Nature. <br/><br/>8.5/10 – Worth two viewings."

","I live in Alaska and have for over 20 years and I have hiked, fished and hunted all over this state for most all of it. I lived here when the events of this movie happened. Christopher McCandless was not a hero or anything of the sort and to portray him in this way in this movie and to gloss over the insanely irresponsible actions he took that led to his completely unnecessary death and only invites other misguided ""wilderness advocates"" to do the same.<br/><br/>Just as in the case of the Timothy Treadwell, who died along with his girlfriend due to his own lack of respect and understanding for the Alaskan Brown bears he claimed to have a ""relationship"" with, and had a movie made about him (Grizzley Man , 2005) McCandless was just another in a long list of ""outsiders"" who read a few books or even less and feel they have the necessary tools to survive in the bush here.<br/><br/>It serves no one to have this movie completely stylize and glamorize the events that are only someone's sanitized version of what happened. In truth McCandless likely died a horrible and lonely death in a completely unnecessary manner and in a completely irresponsible way. If only the movie were stronger to make this point then the it would have served an important role. Instead it only will likely lead to more misguided outsiders, unprepared and irresponsibly doing the same or worse."

","Besides the cinematography and music I completely hated Into The Wild. The following is a list that expresses this hatred toward the glorification of Chris Mccandless, a mentally unstable kid who runs away from home. Spoilers. 1. Chris teaches us that when you have problems at home, just run away. 2. Apparently he and his sister are the only kids to ever have to deal with fighting parents. 3. How could he just leave his sister? He obviously loved her and took care of her. But no, he leaves her there with his psycho parents. Never writes her or anything. 4. He was too scared to stand up to his father. He just ran and hid when his dad hit his mother. 5. He turned down a brand new car from his parents to keep a piece of crap. 6. ""I don't need money."" Umm lets see he needed money for a kayak. He worked for Vince Vaughn and Burger King for money so he could make it to Alaska. Just a little hypocritical there. 7. Apparently being a free-spirit makes you an expert kayaker. 8. Everyone he meets is the absolutely nicest person you could ever meet. 9. The male hippie's lines are laughably bad. 10. Male hippie tells Chris that he and female hippie are not doing good. Chris talks to male hippie for about 20 seconds and then goes swimming with female hippie.

","Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out? <br/><br/>Sean Penn's pop-philosophical examination of this young man's voyage across America, to Alaska, and to the depths of his young soul will give you an interpretation at least. While it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing, it is very clear that Penn respects his subject and gave this film about as much thought and power as he could inject it with. And the film did remind me of something very true about the self-righteous naiveté of youth.<br/><br/>I am not concerned at all with the accuracy of the film, and, while it is tempting to compare this film to Werner Herzog's excellent but less fictionalized ""Grizzly Man"", the subjects are really too widely disparate; Herzog and Penn's perspective on humanity is too different to produce a meaningful comparison. The targets of this comparison, too big and too easy. But I will make one comment about the two films - Penn's film is much more or a tribute to its protagonist than Herzog's.<br/><br/>I found Into the Wild to be a gripping, thoughtful film. The script was good, but sometimes a bit pretentious - occasionally crossing the line between character development and character worship. Penn's direction and cinematography are masterful. The acting - every member of the cast included - is absolutely excellent.<br/><br/>Recommended - but not for light cheerful entertainment."

The portrayal of his 'traumatizing' upbringing was laughable (omg, his parents actually argued loudly and threatened to divorce each other a few times!). So what? As these facts came up, you come to dislike Chris (Alexander Supertramp), more and more. It becomes obvious he is just another spoiled suburban kid running from adult responsibilities, refusing to grow up, yet in the end meeting his match by taking on the Alaskan wilderness, which by the way, doesn't give two figs about how well meaning you are in your quest for 'answers'.

","This really stupid glorification tribute film financed by the extremely wealthy McCandless whose son died a futile death from poisoning , starvation and overexposure in the Alaskan wilderness. <br/><br/>Having graduated from Emory University the super spoiled typical rich kid rebels against what is expected of him by his parents. Like most of his type knowing full well he can always fall back on his parents wealth when it suits them to do so he then sets out on squandering his allowance after reportedly having donating his allowance to charity. The character playing his sister provides a narrative throughout the film providing a rational that his parents premarital experiences as well as their highly strained marriage as the reason for his escape into irresponsible living.<br/><br/>This mainly fantasized account of Chris McCandless's last stage of life includes all these encounters that paint him as a much loved eccentric character idolized by young women, a grain farmer, welfare workers, burnt out hippies and an old man who wants to adopt him. He breaks ecological laws by rafting down the Colorado river without a permit to Mexico where he sweet talks his way back into the USA without ID papers. <br/><br/>McCandless then finishes his little road trip adventure with a hunting trip to the Alaskan wilderness. Despite being fully equipped and armed the idiot McCandless manages to die of a combination of starvation, poisoning and over exposure. <br/><br/>Sean Penn directs this silly film which will no doubt find fans amongst superficial young women and other well to do hippie types. <br/><br/>I suspect these types of films inspire young people to take foolish paths in life that only the rich can afford to take and have seen this happen to friends of mine with similar disastrous consequences.

","As a parent who's reasonably liberal and open-minded I was nevertheless repulsed by the incredibly self-serving main character and director Sean Penn's unsubtle and cloying anti-government/anti-commercialist bent. McCandless may have been a straight-a student but he didn't learn a bloody thing in college. The writings of Byron, London, Tolstoy, Thoreau i.e. are taught as a jumping off point toward self-determination and adulthood. They are not meant to be literally emulated as lifestyles.<br/><br/>And the ridiculous conceit of a 24 year old lecturing an elderly man to open up and go live his life underscores the primary issue with this movie, a misanthropic and deluded main character. Acting was decent enough but I could not for a moment get into the story or the performance due to my disconnect. In scene after scene, I was constantly reminded of the agony McCandless put his poor parents and sister through. Sure they made some mistakes in bringing him up but who's perfect in this world? It would have cost him nothing to simply let them know he was still alive and on 'walk-about' or whatever he thought his pointless odyssey signified. Or at least given them the chance to say good-bye.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I found ""Into the Wild"" irresponsible because McCandless is presented as the rebellious anti-hero rather than a fool who caused his own senseless death and the deepest sorrow of his loved ones. Sean Penn is a talented somehow but choosing the right sorts of role models to present on film is not one of his skills.

But not a particularly interesting story, and a ridiculous one for a film filled with swirling helicopter shots and endless musical montages that are supposed to make you think the smirking Mccandless is some kind of modern Siddhartha.<br/><br/>Sean Penn clearly identifies with his subject enough to direct his film with a similar self-indulgence. This should have been a very straight-forward account of one young idealist's cowardice: too afraid to help the society he thought was sick, too afraid too deal with his family with compassion, and ultimately too afraid to kill himself outright: instead he just put himself into a situation that he couldn't survive without rescue...and nobody rescued him.<br/><br/>I wonder about the people who rave about this movie.

To be frank, the film is nothing more than the bastard love-child of Dead Poets Society and Grizzly Adams...except suckier. <br/><br/>Christoper McCandless was not only a misguided, self-absorbed, self-indulgent youth, he IS the ultimate idiot. There isn't a single quality to admire about him, with the exception of his generous donation to charity. An action, I would suspect this misanthrope made with the sole purpose of pi$$ing his parents off. Simply put, this film is the ""whoa as me"" tale of a rich, spoiled, young man who was TOO determined to prove that the apple sometimes does fall far from the tree. He is completely undeserving of the accolades or screen time he managed to eek out of Hollywood. <br/><br/>His ""quest"" for the ultimate human experience cost him his life...and to gain what?

Congratulations Emory, you taught the boy well!! <br/><br/>Seriously, all of you who gave this movie higher than a 3, would you really put yourself in the position that he put himself? Would you not have spent some time in Alaska, maybe worked a job to acclimate yourself to the land? Would you not have gotten a little advice, perhaps taken a guided tour and survival courses? Would you not have learned about weather patterns and considered that after crossing a river before the summer thaw meant that you wouldn't be able to cross it when the snow began to melt?? <br/><br/>No, this yahoo simply asks someone to drive him to the end of the road and drop him off on a trail. Smart buddy! The countdown on your life just began. In truth, Chris McCandless committed suicide and Hollywood pathetically glorified it. <br/><br/>Yeah, yeah, I realize he had ""books"" to help him out.

Any rational person would have realized they were in trouble months before this guy. ""Hmm...I keep taking notches up on my belt. I am eating every day...nothing but lean protein..but still, I am eating. Yet, I have managed to lose 60 pounds. Gosh, I wonder if something is wrong??"" <br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of this film is that it does manage to remind us that Mother Nature will always be there to strike you down when you begin to get a little too righteous for her taste. Or, in this case, she will leave you to die, alone, in the shell of an old school bus, surrounded by the philosophical b.s. that put you there in the first place, wasted away in a pool of your own feces."
"Chris Knipp","9","81","131","22 September 2007"," One hell of a young man
","Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild' is a passionate and faithful evocation of Jon Krakauer's book about Chris McCandless. It's the troubling and complex story of a young idealist and seeker who was also a rebellious child and beloved brother who gave away his $24,000 savings to Oxfam after college, went off in an old Datsun and left his family behind, and disappeared for two years wandering the country, only to be found by hunters dead of poisoning and starvation in an abandoned bus in the wilds of Alaska.<br/><br/>It's been said as a criticism of Penn's movie that it isn't as neutral about McCandless as Krakauers's book. It is true that Emile Hirsch as Chris, who called himself Alexander Supertramp on the road, is such a joyous and appealing character it's hard to focus on the arbitrariness and foolhardiness of the young man. Hirsch gives his all. He has shown his knack for playing bad good boysparticularly in 'Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' and 'Lords of Dogtown'and for playing wild misfitsin the little seen 'The Mudge Boy.' This is the first great role he's had, and he deserves it. His work is a wonderful melding of ""negative capability"" and generosity. It comes naturally to him to embody exuberance, boldness, and joy. If there was something off-putting or stern in the real-life McCandless, it's not very noticeable in Hirsch. But Hirsch's enthusiasm makes sense of the great adventure and self-discovery this story recounts. (Sadly, McCandless never seemed more ready to embrace life, and to overcome all his doubts about people and family, than right near his end.) All the faults McCandless had and mistakes he made made are there in the story as Penn tells it; if he has altered facts (and necessarily left some out), he hasn't done so to make the young man's plans seem clearer or his choices wiser, and the movie is replete with specific detail.<br/><br/>'Into the Wild,' true, is itself a little on the wild and loud side, with its occasionally obtrusive Eddie Vedder soundtrack, it's insanely vivid characterslike the young Danish couple on the banks of the Colorado, Vince Vaughan's intense, grinning grain farmer, Hal Holbrook's fabulously sad, shut-down old widower. There is another kind of overload in the occasional use of split screens. But it all unfolds very much as Jon Krakauer's book does, with interludes at the ""magic bus"" where Chris met his doom constantly intercut with episodes from his travels earlier during his two wander-years. And incredible episodes they are: roaming with a warm hippie couple; illegally and hair-raisingly running the Colorado rapids in a kayak; working in the big grain elevator and loving it; riding the rails and loving that too, till he's caught and beaten; escaping a flophouse in L.A.; staying with old Mr. Franz (Holbrook), learning from him how to engrave leather belts and persuading him to climb a mountain; and then off into the hostile snow country with a big back pack and sheer will. Many voiceovers from Chris's sister add more about the sibling relationship than was in the book; the family ""fearlessly"" cooperated in the film-making. McCandless's stern NASA honcho dad (William Hurt) and uptight mother (Marcia Gay Harden) are as unappealing as he saw them, but are not overdrawnor underrepresented. Among other things Sean Penn's film is a remarkable balancing act.<br/><br/>It's obvious this story had to be made into a movie, and it's hard to imagine how anyone could have done it better than Penn and his fine cast. All Penn's directorial efforts have been heartfelt and earnest, but this of his films thus far is his greatest artistic success and has the widest appeal. Into the Wild is a good balance of the emotionally wrenching and the thought-provoking. It contains so many themes and poses so many questionsabout youth, about time, about responsibility. Chris isn't to be confused with Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'. He's aware of the danger of nature. It's just that he has the hubris of daring to approach it with too little knowledge and experience, knowing the risk, and taking it. And indeed he might have made it and gotten back out, but for two or three terrible mistakes. Nature is unforgiving.<br/><br/>Chris McCandless was unforgiving too. But if he read the romantic Bible of his own life lived in those intense two years and lived to tell of them, the film suggests, he would have learned to love and forgive. He was bright, talented, passionate about life, a seeker or rare moral fervor who read and thought and recorded all that happened in those last days. His death was sadly premature. But there are signsthey're clear in Krakauer's bookthat he made an impact on the world he inhabited and the people he met. Vince Vaughan's character shouts, ""You're one hell of a young man. You're one hell of a young man!"" He died terribly alone. But maybe the tree that falls in the forest is heard after all. ""Quant'e' bella giovanezza,"" goes an Italian renaissance verse, ""Che si fugge tuttavia."" How beautiful is youth, which flees straightaway. McCandless' story embodies those lines.<br/><br/>'Into the Wild' seems more moving and thought-provoking than any other recent film, and may be destined to become some kind of classican 'Easy Rider', some have said, for our times. It's about society and nature, about family, about idealism and aloneness; most of all it's about the dangerous, heartbreakingly brief and beautiful romanticism of youth. In those two years, Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life. And Sean Penn has captured those two years for us."

","Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) ""Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,"" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.<br/><br/>I think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn't feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man ""when you forgive, you love."" We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that ""happiness (is) only real when shared"", which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.<br/><br/>I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: ""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...""<br/><br/>And at the end as I thought about McCandless's life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: ""Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away."""

","This is a really good movie, unfortunately I could not remove myself from the fact that the main character was a complete moron. First of all contrary to what people feel, ""dropping out of society"" is a lazy, b.s. way of rebelling against corporate society, and never achieves anything but a self fulfilled prophecy. Here is what native Alaskans felt about this fool in general. ""Krakauer's book made McCandless a heroic figure to many.Unlike Krakauer and many readers of his book, who have a largely sympathetic view of McCandless, some Alaskans have negative views of both McCandless and those who romanticize his fate. McCandless was unaware that a hand-operated tram crossed the river a quarter mile from the Stampede Trail, while a nearby shelter was stocked with emergency supplies, as described in Krakauer's book. However, the three nearby cabins were broken in and vandalized extensively at some point after mid-April, thus destroying food and first-aid supplies, as noted by Jon Krakauer. Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote: ""I am exposed continually to what I will call the 'McCandless Phenomenon.' People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent ... When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament ... Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide."" Judith Kleinfeld wrote in the Anchorage Daily News that ""many Alaskans react with rage to his stupidity. You'd have to be a complete idiot, they say, to die of starvation in summer 20 miles off the Park's Highway.""[12] Thank you very much, but making a martyr out of a moron is just too much."

Christopher McCandless is the product of a society, which places too much value on the individual - hence his ultimately selfish decision to take flight to his over-romanticised 'wilderness' (an abandoned bus!!!)- rather than use his all-too-lauded intelligence to better it.<br/><br/>What a character for hero-worship!! The way in which he is - and I don't use the term lightly - deified by Sean Penn ranges from the unpalatable to the damn near puke-making.<br/><br/>There are a couple of moments in this film, which epitomise this errant viewpoint.

","I found something utterly fascinating in the true story of Christopher McCandless, venturing out into the ""wild"" of Alaska with basically nothing but a gun and some food, and eventually succumbing to the inevitable.<br/><br/>
I passed no judgment on him or his decisions when I read through the story, focusing more on the mystery of what drove him to a vagabond existence culminating in total hermitage from which he absolutely could not survive. The cliché of ""the devil is in the details"" is one horribly true here, and tends to tear apart the story.<br/><br/>
In truth, McCandless essentially committed suicide. He refused all the necessary help to survive in the cold, did not even learn how to dry meat, and, had he had a map, could have easily walked back to civilization at almost any point in time.<br/><br/>
In fact, we can learn almost nothing from McCandless or his time spent in the wild, as his journal entries are as mindless and empty and almost completely devoid of any real content. They literally amount to things like ""Day 2: Fall through the ice day."" ""Day 4: Magic bus day."" ""Day 9: Weakness."" ""Day 10: Snowed in."" ""Day 68: Beaver Dam. Disaster."" ""Day 107 (the last entry): Beautiful berries""<br/><br/>
Going into the actual film itself, we get virtually none of this. Instead we are taken on a tediously long, droning journey that covers almost none of the survival aspects and just covers his wandering through the US in the years leading up to the event.<br/><br/>
Throughout this ""journey"" we're treated to overly dramatic musical montages waxing poetic on how ""society, man, society is just society, man"" ranting and railing with all the emptiness and incoherence of someone with basic understanding of almost everything, but knowledge of almost nothing.<br/><br/>Life sure does sucks for a rich white kid who graduates from a prestigious university with nearly all A's, the movie tells us. How can you be happy with things like money and a job instead of living in the woods, hanging out with psychotically upbeat Danish tourists you meet after barely surviving a dangerous river paddling you jump in with 0 paddling experience, ignoring the guy who tells you you need to sign on with a professional because you could die. What does he know? Society, man. Screw society, man.<br/><br/>
The truth about the abuse he and his sister suffered from their parents wasn't revealed publicly by the time his movie was made (though she did disclose it off the record to the book author Jon Krakauer), so it's never made fully explicit here. But the whole theme of the movie is such that it doesn't matter, because it doesn't easily fit into the theme that ""society sucks and you can only be happy living in the woods"".<br/><br/>
The immense scale of the romanticization is insufferable. It becomes painfully pretentious almost immediately and it makes the protagonist thoroughly unlikeable; a vapid, empty vessel literally living the dream of the vapid spoiled white kid who worships nature and thinks modern society is a drag. The least I can say about this fictional version of McCandless is he is at least completely devoid of the self-righteous spite and meanness of a character like Holden Caulfield. He's not rubbing our faces in this pretentious message; the film itself is, and sometimes it seems as if he's just as much a victim as we are, having his adventure luridly fetishized as if he were an idol, and not someone who was way in over their head.<br/><br/>
I can't help but think of a similar story of someone who died in the Alaska wilderness, Carl McCunn in 1981. He went with almost 2 tons of food and supplies, multiple weapons, and actually left highly detailed journal entries telling a tragic story of a man who made a rather different mistake; He did not make it clear to the pilot who left him in the wilderness to return for him 5 months later. As 5 months slips into 6 months, you can clearly feel the pain in his entries as he realizes he is likely never coming back alive, and no one is likely to come looking for him. At one point, he is even spotted by a state trooper flying over in a plane, but laments in his journal that he apparently accidentally signaled to the trooper that he was okay and not in need of rescue. His final entry is a plea to God to forgive him and look over his family, then writing ""They say it doesn't hurt"" before taking his own life rather than freeze to death.<br/><br/>
There's nothing remotely like that in this film. The film barely lingers on Chris's experience of solitude in the wild, preferring to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his silly adventures, interspersed with upbeat montage after montage set to popular music"

","I agree with many others who have said that the main character makes some bad decisions (And you haven't?), and I agree that the film's story is far from the greatest story that has ever been made into a film. However, the story here is an important one that has a lot to say about being human. The story itself is certainly not at all an easy one to tell through the cinematic medium. Nonetheless, I really do think Sean Penn has captured this story nearly as well as it possibly could have been told on film, and that in itself is a stunning accomplishment. This story is so real, so human, that it reaches out and has obviously grabbed a ton of peoples hearts, including mine. The scenes themselves give off a very authentic feeling, even where some parts are somewhat rushed through for the betterment of the whole story, it ends up working well in full scope. Many of the scenes are extremely intimate, including the scene where Hirsch looks directly into the camera to increase this very aspect I feel. I know a lot of people have criticized this part, and I agree in most films it would have no place whatsoever, but here it is a very daring and effective decision by Penn in my opinion. Much of the film displays a vast amount of scenic beauty, and the scenes at slab city are nothing short of 'classic'.<br/><br/>To me, the important thing to take from the film is not why Chris decided to leave his parents and society. Nor do I think anyone can in their right mind criticize this decision he made. That is pointless. The fact is that it was his choice, whatever his accumulative reasons may have been is beside the point. The value here is in what he learns from the experience, and the incredible way in which he and Sean Penn have now shared that message with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Eddie Vedders music was obviously the perfect choice for this film, as it sways with emotional depth and helps to carry the films authentic feel. There are many great acting performances here as well, none better than Catherine Keener's brilliant delivery of grace and genuine heart.<br/><br/>The story here ventures into the territory that drives all human experience. The search for authentic heart that all people, knowingly or not search for.<br/><br/>The heart searches for heart, only to find itself treading in a sea of broken hearts, all cut from the same Divine Cloth.

While I hated the movie myself, I can honestly highly recommend ""Into the Wild"" to certain people under certain conditions.<br/><br/>""Into the Wild"" would make an excellent teaching tool for film professors to show their students what not to do when making a film. It turns out to be a pretty comprehensive survey. The egregious overuse of alternative camera techniques is a good cautionary tale. Folks who want to see some nostalgic camera angles that haven't been used since the original ""Batman"" series might be particularly pleased. Also, since there is at least 60 minutes of unnecessary footage left in the film by the editors, you could use this as an opportunity to have students edit the movie themselves.<br/><br/>There are endless opportunities for party games you could invent around this movie. Have your party guests take a drink every time there's a cheesy camera shot or redundant voice-over or caption. You can also play ""mute the film and guess the dialogue."" Whoever comes closest to the actual dialogue wins, and whoever can't predict what is being said at all gets thrown out of the party.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have already mentioned the movie's potential as a sleep aid. I don't know if I would go that far, but I think ""Into the Wild"" would make a great background to working out. There is something about watching a movie make the same point over and over for over 2 hours, to bad music, that reminds me of the rigors of exercise. Repetition, pain, fatigue, and ultimately relief that it's over."

At least leave it under a rock for some poor traveler to enjoy! He travels by bumming rides (and food) from others -- how hypocritical can the ""self-sufficient"" man become? He's happy he found a straw hat in a field -- are we supposed to respect him for that? Perhaps if he had had the skill to make the hat himself, he might have earned some grudging respect. Then he hikes ""into the wild"" in Alaska (after having bummed yet another ride) and settles in an abandoned bus. He's nothing but a gigantic parasite, going on interminably about how evil money is, while at the same time enjoying the fruits of other people's labor (and money), even if some of the items have been discarded. I wish he had never found the bus, but had had to live under a tree. How long would he have lasted then? To top off his irresponsible behavior and total selfishness, he simply disappears without informing his family, causing them no end of emotional stress. I'm sorry, this character was just an asshole. I'm only halfway into the movie right now, but having read other spoilers, I know he eventually dies, apparently in a senseless fashion. I perversely find myself looking forward to this event, as horrible as that sounds. I cannot believe that this movie was nominated for an Oscar.

We have an idealist who burns money and gives his college fund to Oxfam to feed others, but in his wending west seems never to turn down a free meal or a free ride, while turning down implied and implicit offers to adopt him by those who have lost children, and turning down sex from a 16-year-old (ethical, but a bit out of place in a hippie encampment). He gets good advice from all the nice people he meets (the only not-nice person in the film is the railroad guard who beats him) and apparently forgets it all on the spot. <br/><br/>In Alaska, it really gets silly. Apparently he is somewhere in the Tanana Valley, if his plant book is anything to go by, living in a steel bus hull lacking a window or two. I know a family who wintered in Tok (in that valley) in an insulated tent with no windows: they cut and burned a cord of wood _daily_ to survive (they did have a chainsaw). He apparently stops cutting wood entirely after gathering some sticks on a beach in California. Certainly, he lucks out in the matter of light--whoever abandoned the bus apparently left gallons and gallons of oil behind--he is never in the dark. Or without matches, for that matter. <br/><br/>He kills a cow moose, apparently with a .22, which is really wonderful shooting--moose have been known to pay about as much attention to .22 bullets as they do to yellowjackets. In good weather, he seems to spend his time mooning in the bus instead of hunting, fishing, or bringing in wood for next winter. When he gets desperate for food to the point of delirium, he eats the wrong plant and poisons himself. <br/><br/>It was depressing to learn that this was a ""real"" story, that a genuine kid apparently was this appealing and this dumb.

","When Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated from college, he had one goal in life - to finally break away from his unhappy family and the constraints of society in general and live off the land in Alaska. The episodic film flashes back and forth between Chris' adventures in Alaska and the months leading up to it, focusing on the people who befriended him, including an aging hippie couple and a lonely, old man (well-played by the venerable Hal Holbrook).<br/><br/>Based on a true story and narrated with many of Chris' journal entries, the film is an emotional roller coaster; I was torn between admiring his youthful idealism and courage and hating him for the pain he inflicted on his family. The movie feels much like a documentary as it follows Chris hitchhiking and working his way across the country and then surviving, at first, quite well in Alaska.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is well-cast as Chris and makes you care about him right from the start. He did all of his demanding stunts himself and even lost 40 pounds to play the ailing Chris. It is a very touching story.

","I am generally easy to please when it comes to films. Prior to this, the worst thing I could say about a film was that it was a bit dull. Into the Wild changed all of that. I can only imagine what the real Christopher was like, but if this is supposed to portray him in a positive light, I doubt he had many redeeming features. Every single thing he did made me hate him more. To begin with, he had a fantastic life. As the summary on this website says, he was a 'top student and athlete'. He had a decent sum of money for a student, and a family who cared for him. So what does he do? He throws all of it away on a whim. He gives his money away, destroys everything he owns and completely abandons civilisation, all without telling his family a thing. This is one of the most reckless, selfish, idiotic, inconsiderate things I have ever heard of. I understand wanting to reconnect with nature, I understand that people feel that society is too materialistic. If you want to indulge those feelings, go camping. Go on safari. Volunteer for a charity. What you do not do is throw away your entire life. And if you do decide to destroy everything you have ever achieved, you could at least have the common courtesy to tell your parents where you are. He could easily have kept in touch with his family while on his insane quest. All he accomplished by keeping quiet was making his parents fear for his life. Fear which was perfectly justified, considering the ending. On his journey into the depths of stupidity, he met several people who were inexplicably sympathetic to his situation. They offered him every opportunity to live his life with them. He had every chance to abandon his aimless wandering, but he turned them all down. Why? Because he was convinced that he knew better than everybody else. He ends up dying due to his own bottomless stupidity when he eats poisonous berries, despite the fact that he had a guidebook which told him which berries were safe to eat. Any reasonable person would consult the book BEFORE eating the mystery fruits. I hated everything about him, throughout the film my fists were usually clenched. When he died at the end of the film, I imagine the audience was supposed to cry. I laughed out loud for five minutes. I know that makes me sound like a monster, but it's the truth. If a team of psychologists and writers studied me for years on end and created a character whose sole purpose was to make me angry, they would not even come close to the blinding fury that I experienced watching this film.

","How can you describe a film like Into the Wild? One of the greats & by far my favourite film of all time. The only film I have ever seen which manages to capture the true spirit of adventure. The beauty of Into the Wild for me is that what Christopher McCandless is running from is never as important as what he is running to. Sean Penn has directed this film with magnificent precision and imaginative grace. Every scene, every image used in this film tells it's own story and the countless people Chris meets along the way are as magical and integral to his journey as his survival in the wilderness. I love the beautiful simplicity of this film and how it has captured nature in both it's breathtaking and dangerous forms so perfectly.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is a sensational actor and helps make Into the Wild what it is. His acting is totally believable, and the story often trips along with him silently acting, using nothing but his body and facial expressions to put across emotions and thoughts. A perfect cast alongside Emile, including the likes of Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart and Hal Holbrook, all help make Into the Wild an enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>Into the Wild has a very special quality to it, something which I can't quite put my finger on. It is a culmination of things, from the beautiful imagery, the fantastic script, the amazing cast, the often mesmerising quotations and of course the feeling of adventure and of true freedom. It is a unique vision into the life of a young man searching for himself in a dangerous environment who comes to realise that the true meaning of happiness may not be what he first thought.

"L. Lion","6","31","54","6 January 2008"," overlong, and without epiphany
","Sean Penn's sometimes engrossing and often beautiful film Into The Wild is, in the end analysis, about a character who was basically selfish and self-centered. Like Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors, whom I found to be a self-centered ass, eventually I felt I was on a journey that had little or no revelation, with a person who was primarily selfish, and which leads to (spoiler follows) starvation in the Alaskan wilderness, an ending in which the only meaning I could find was that if you are going to camp next to a river and live off the land, bring a damn fishing pole.<br/><br/>This is not to say the film does not have its strengths. The cinematography makes the most of the beautiful landscapes through which Alexander Supertramp, in an earlier incarnation Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) passes. Also of note are some very strong performances by Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook as people that Alexander meets and bonds with during his journey. The same cannot be said of the lead, however.<br/><br/>Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a bright, upper middle class young man who has just graduated college. His parents are ready to gift him with a new car and hope he will apply to Harvard Law. He has other plans - to break the bonds of ordinary American existence and walk the Earth, rootless and without clear destination, in search of ... enlightenment? Escape? Even Chris doesn't seem to know.<br/><br/>The film is narrated by Chris' sister, Carine (played by Jena Malone), and we get some back-story. Chris was a born wanderer - at 4, he wandered away from home at 3 AM and was found 6 blocks away raiding a neighbor's cookie jar. His family life was unhappy - his parents had the kind of marriage that should have led to divorce, but didn't. And he feels a deep, internal rejection of modern life. He burns all his IDs, gives away his money, and drives off into the American southwest in his beat up Datsun. Sleeping in it one night he is caught in a flash flood, and abandons the car, setting off on foot, Burning Man style, with just the shoes on his feet and a backpack, on a voyage of discovery, and taking a new name - Alexander Supertramp.<br/><br/>These are all things that I could sympathize with. Many young people coming out of college seek something different from the lives their parents led. Alexander is simply taking the vision quest to a greater extreme. Without letting his family know where he is, he just disappears. In two years he will climb the highest peak of his journey, tramping off into the Alaskan wilderness alone, into the wild, to get away from civilization altogether.<br/><br/>The initial periods of his journey are the film's strength. Intermittently flashing forward and back from Alaska, the film follows Alex as he meets a couple of hippies with an RV, kayaks down the Colorado river into Mexico, then finds his way to South Dakota where he drives a combine, and so on. On his journey he bonds with a number of unusual individuals, and decides that the place he wants to be is Alaska, away from civilization completely.<br/><br/>However, the film begins to drag. It runs long (two and a half hours) and feels longer. There are really no revelations on his journey, just a series of beautiful landscapes and sometimes kooky characters that float in and out of his life. By the time he meets old coot Ron Franz (a superb Hal Holbrook) I was ready for this movie to hurry up and get to the resolution of his Alaskan adventure. When it is finally reached, I found it rather pointless - although he is equipped for the Wild, has a rifle for hunting, and has found a great camping site (an abandoned bus with a mattress as shelter), his supplies begin to run out and game becomes scarce. Forced to forage for edible plants and berries, he mistakes a poisonous plant for something edible. He is cut off from escape by a flooded river (and has, as I mentioned, NO FISHING POLE) and eventually weakens and succumbs to starvation. He could have at least tried spear-fishing - he had a knife and some waterproof boots.<br/><br/>The film also focuses, perhaps inadvertently, on something Alex did that I found to be unforgivable - the torture of his parents. They see him one last time after graduation at a McCormick & Schmick's in Atlanta before he disappears, and spend the ensuing two years in a state of agony over where their son is. Although I appreciated Alex' desire to find meaning in his life, not providing any word as to his well-being with his parents or his sister is just unforgivable. That may be a personal judgment about the character that not all people who watch this film will share, but that was my reaction.<br/><br/>Another flaw in this film is the casting of Emile Hirsch as the lead. He is appealingly good looking, but there is an inner fire missing there as an actor. Hirsch' Alexander is empty for me. I followed him across some amazing landscapes and through many interesting meetings without ever discovering why someone felt they needed to make a movie out of a young man who became a tramp after college and then starved to death in Alaska. Hal Holbrook is able to convey more depth and emotion in his brief time on screen than Hirsch does while on screen for almost three hours.<br/><br/>There are many sections of Into The Wild that I thoroughly enjoyed, and for a brief period during the first half of the film I was thoroughly engrossed.

"effortlessvi","3","5","6","2 December 2017"," Must be a historical thing?
","Okay, a rating of 3 might be a bit harsh. But this review is more as a warning to people who are not necessarily into the slow moving, abstract, philosophical kind of movie. This is the type that might be awarded an Oscar for its artsy approach, but that most people will find dull and extremely boring. <br/><br/>The plot, without spoiling too much, is about a guy traveling on the road, meeting people along the way. It essentially flips between scenery shots of him just walking, spouting indistinguishable poetry, and then ten to fifteen minute encounters with people he immediately hits it off with, before he wanders again. It has like 7-8 of these talking sessions, over more than a 2 hour duration.<br/><br/>The main character cites poetry throughout much of the movie when he is alone, which I guess appeals to people who fancy spending their free time reading poetry. It leaves it up to you to find meaning in them, but to be honest, with such a slow pacing movie, many will likely find themselves bored, and poetry works best when you are intrigued and excited initially.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is about trying to make the audience read into the emotions of a wandering loner who has discarded all his belongings and connections. If you are not the kind of guy or girl who likes to intensely try to find subtle meanings to everything, when they are not even necessarily there, this movie will be quite empty and slow moving. <br/><br/>Basically, those who enjoy typical ""Oscar"" style movies where the producer tries his best to put in as much ""art"" on expense of ""content"" and ""moving story line"", will enjoy this. People who are in for a fun watch, or a watch of concrete substance without having to literally work themselves to add meaning to every small thing that happens, should simply avoid. It won't give you anything whatsoever."

The main character is based on a real person who had psychiatric mental health issues that were not mentioned in credits before or after the film. The characters he meets on his meandering, aimless journey are in some parts shallow & therefore not that interesting.

"t_atzmueller","4","5","6","3 May 2015"," How the hipsters would like to view reality Or What is a martyr for some people, is a Darwin-Award-winner for others
","First, let me begin to say that I'm rather perplexed by the high rating here on IMDb and that this film is in the Top-250 range. But perhaps I shouldn't be. Not if one considers, that many an impressionable teenager and young adult since the films release has equally ran off into the wild, presumably in order to perish like their idol.<br/><br/>To tell the whole story in a few simple terms: Bright young teenager Chris McCandless is sick and tired or living in luxury, decides that the materialism of his background is not for him. He abandons his family, savings and worldly possession, taking off on a road-trip, that will take him across half the country, eventually leading him to an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness. There Chris hopes for the sanctuary and natural living that he has for so long desired, but instead starves (the movie opts for the theory that McCandless succumbed to eating poisonous plant) in his sleeping-bag and, after being found by moose-hunters, his ashes are shipped back to his family. The End.<br/><br/>We could call this the rich-kid's version of ""Easy Rider"", but rather, another film comes to mind namely Werner Herzogs ""Grizzly Man"". Equally based on a true story, with a similar tragic end. However, Herzog (and most of those being interviewed by Herzog) do not stylize the subject or try to make Timothy Treadwell looks like anything other than what he was: a full-blown narcissist with less common-sense than your average lapdog, who was literally begging for some hungry bear to come by and consume him (eventually having his wish granted and taking down his girlfriend with him in the process). Sean Penn chooses another approach. His ""Alexander Supertramp"" - the nome de guerre Chris McCandless - is a martyr, if not the template for a hipster-martyr. But Penn doesn't seem able to describe what this particular form of martyrdom should be. Should be pity McCandless? Because his parents are rich, but shallow, and quarrel a lot among themselves? Who could imagine a fate more horrible than that? There's a telling scene in the beginning, where young Chris contemplates the misery and misfortune of his parents wanting to buy him a new car. His refusal to accept this gift is interpreted by Penn as an act of rebellion. Sorry people, ain't buying. These are sentiments that are reserved for the Upper-10,000's, who can afford the luxury of disdaining money (since they have enough of it anyway) and claim that a bout of depression caused by boredom equals the suffering of a Christ on a crucifix.<br/><br/>Some of the movie could have worked as your typical road-movie and coming-of-age story. Except: the figure of Chris McCandless never comes to come-of-age. He sets out with the determination of somebody who has already consumed the entire bowl of knowledge, culled entirely from a book-shelf. On his way he bestows shallow wisdom and platitudes to all that cross his path (well-meaning hippies; simple, yet down to earth farmhands; a lonely veteran and a horny, under-aged trailer-trash chick), Never once does our protagonist considering things like responsibility - perhaps for your friends and family, who are worried sick about not knowing where or how Chris is - or even the consequences of action. Like, finding certain death in the inhospitable wilderness. In other words, the character of Chris seems to have respect for only one thing in the world: his own intellect, which he considers superior since, you know, he has read a lot of books, from Tolstoy to Jack London. Again, I remind you, we are supposed to root for this character. Did the real Chris McCandless have a death-wish? Did he subliminally commit suicide without having to get his hands dirty? Or did he suffer from a mental-illness, like paranoia or schizophrenia? Much of the evidence that has been presented since, point toward those directions. Yet, the film chooses to ignore each and every one and goes with the martyr-figure right to the end.<br/><br/>So, despite the film having redeeming factors on the technical side, the moral of the story escapes me. What should have been a cautionary tale, is presented as a triumph, where the ultimate fail is portrayed as a victory. Victory over what? Common sense? I'd give it a 4/10-rating for beautiful cinematography, nice editing, good soundtrack (even though to some the Eddie Vedder-compositions may end up sounding too schmaltzy) and the occasional good performance. But these are just technical aspects, that camouflage the utter lack of substance or meaning that is deeper than the bottom of a tea-cup."

Does he have a problem with his parents? Not really. He feels no relationship towards them, though. A good part of the film is narrated by his sister, evidently she is writing about him in a diary or something. I felt like screaming at the screen, ""Dude, even if your parents don't love you, your sister does. She misses you and wants you to come home."" On a brighter note, this gets my award for the worst movie with the best soundtrack. Eddie Vedder, turning to a more Bruce Springsteen/Woody Guthrie frame of mind, wrote some outstanding tunes for the soundtrack, including ""Hard Sun"". I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan, have been since I was 14, and this is some of the best stuff Vedder has ever written. Get the soundtrack instead."
"uhchilly","2","60","114","11 March 2008"," definition of a bad movie
","This movie is it. It was very difficult to separate my own personal taste from objective review but after a day or two of simmering I think I can encapsulate my thoughts on this truly disappointing movie.<br/><br/>Basic things like expository narration. This is a movie not a radio play. Having the redundant narration of his sister (which was very poorly done) sounding like an actor reading through lines in a coffee shop rehearsal lacked authenticity and constantly removed you from the ability to make your own conclusions about the emotional state of the characters. <br/><br/>The choice to have on multiple occasions Chris stare directly at the camera utterly baffled me. Moments like that (say at the ending of Magnolia) should generally be reserved for situations where character and audience through the weight and momentum of the story are drawn to some mutual realization (not exclusively but you get my drift). Once is maybe OK but, again, as with the narration, the self-centred direction is encouraging us to accept the movie's supposed profundity by continually doing this amateurish nonsense rather than having the confidence to let the story stand on its own merit. Very, very lame direction there.<br/><br/>The dialogue was utterly unbelievable and preachy. Now I can take a story with a moral focus or political slant as much as the next guy but it seems like a case of a writer not having a clue what a screenplay is supposed to be. Actions should be more important than words or at least on equal footing but in this movie, words are not parts of conversations between the characters or even thoughtful narration but rather some sermon directed AT the audience. The movie was like its own good review..""Look at how sublime I am! Look at how profound I am!""<br/><br/>The acting by everyone except Hirsch was good. Hirsch was a single note playing for two and half hours. Zero empathy was derived from his monochrome performance. The character begins self-centred and dies self-centred. It could be argued that his ""call it by its real name"" blathering was monumental change in his character that was the culmination of this journey but it was sabotaged by an actor with no range and a director with no confidence in either the story or its performers. Instead we are left with everything being spelled out for us ..yet again.. about how seeing the world through Chris' eyes is the only way to see the world.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give I a single star was because it looked great. <br/><br/>This movie was a pretty big insult I think, since attempts to spiritualize a character or more correctly, spiritualize his ""experiences"", without ever giving the audience a chance to empathize. Instead we get sermonized. <br/><br/>This DVD is only good as a coaster for my drink."

"MaxBorg89","10","26","45","20 May 2008"," Exceptional in every possible way
","Sean Penn's Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as ""if you only see one film this year"" and goes beyond the very notion of ""Oscar-worthy"". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.<br/><br/>A rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the film's unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauer's book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasn't really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. ""I'm going into the wild"" the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, that's where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.<br/><br/>Christopher's journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and won't be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christopher's would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the character's message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before it's too late. It doesn't matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.<br/><br/>To simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>Into the Wild isn't an ""easy"" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many ""issue movies"" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry."
"Brawl_666","2","29","51","12 March 2009"," the guy needs a good shrink
","For me, this was by far the single most pretentious and overrated mainstream film of 2007. Even without reading the article on Wiki, I guessed that this guy was either schizo or bipolar. For a guy who supposedly majored in History and Anthropology, Chris McCandless was hugely sentimental and romantic, and ultimately just foolish. So he reads Tolstoy and Thoreau, and trudges off into the wild ?? Perhaps he ought to have read some Kafka and Dostoevsky too : he would have realized that for man there is simply no escaping himself and the world. So yes, society is indeed based on mutual deception and empty conventions, but rejecting everyone and everything isn't the solution. Far from it. Its much more challenging to be a part of society and yet try to lead an authentic life. How many such radicals and ""total solutions"" have we already seen in the past ?? They always fail.<br/><br/>The film itself sheds zero light on the motives of the real Chris McCandless. I don't think it tells the truth about what actually happened to him. He lives in an alternate universe where he can happily live in the wild and on city streets after living a pampered upper-class life for 22 years. No troubles, no complaints. And throughout its long runtime, the film goes on hammering the point that society and civilized men are terrible, and bums, hippies and the dregs of society are the Lord's cherished angels.<br/><br/>It figures that Sean Penn, the fashionable self-styled outsider, would make something like this. Its right up his alley. I didn't enjoy this at all. Above all else, its dreamy and unrealistic. Its an ironic film, in that its a lesson for young people what NOT to do, i.e. turn your back on your responsibilities and look for ultimate solutions."

He lived a boring uneventful life tooling around in the wild for a while (should be some dramatic music here) usually by mooching off others or off the technology and civilization he abhorred. He created nothing. He changed nothing. He shaped nothing. He selfishly and thoughtlessly abandoned his family including a sister who loved him and never did him a bit of harm. He managed to walk away from everyone who ever cared about him or wanted to befriend him or help him. He had that always charming arrogance of those who believe they have all the answers to life that us lesser people just can't see. We insist on having a shower in the morning and not having lice in our hair or stinking. More the fools us. Apparently smelling back and hopping freight trains is some king of revelation of truth. If only we would abandon all this modern science and technology and just pee on a tree or look at a mountain. There has always been a cult that believed the secret was to run away.

Well that is the difference between us and animals. We try to do something, to learn something and make something and we fail and we try again. We do not run away. Why would anyone want to spend over two hours watching this pathetic loser destroy himself. It is like watching grizzly man.

","I saw this movie at an advanced screening in Nashville on August 23, 2007. Although it was a little long, it was a great movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows an Emory grad who struggles to find the meaning of life. He travels across the country (ultimately to Alaska) and along the way he touches lives and becomes a man.<br/><br/>This movie really makes a person reevaluate their priorities in life and I personally found it to be inspiring. The director did a beautiful job with the story line and the landscapes were incredible.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn plays a small part and is his usual lovable self. Emile Hirsch was wonderful and has a bright future in acting. <br/><br/>One shocker was the random brief nudity of men and women.<br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing at least once."
"jackbenimble","1","37","69","28 November 2010"," Unbelievable and shallow as all hell!!
","This was a very unsatisfying movie. It starts out with promise and spectacularly fails to deliver . Where to start? The basic premise of a chap going off to live alone in the wild with adventures all along the way is a good one. But nothing really interesting or compelling ever happens in this. The best thing about travelling and wandering about the world is all the interesting and unusual characters you meet along the way. But I can't describe the tedious, one dimensional humourless dullards our 'hero' meets. The long drawn out 'deep' interactions they have about nothing except how sad and unhappy their lives are. All so full of pain.Deep people aren't full of pain. Deep people are people with something to say. The scenery was nice though and there was some camera work going on but that can't make up for flat characters, a dead script, lack of a cohesive storyline that develops (this was just a collage of fragments of happenings strung together going everywhere but nowhere) bad acting and most of all any real philosophical idea behind it. After all, people take off into the wild alone for deep reasons regarding their relationship to modern society not just because they had a tiff with their parents and like eating squirrels. There was a point where some tensions develop in the killing of a big bull thing and you expected that our boy was becoming a man with all the challenges. But then it took a serious dive when he goes back to the hippies and meets a very pretty but incredibly shallow girl and quickly reverts back to being a child again. From then on it never picks up and draws out slowly and interminably to a sad ending. I've said enough. The fact that so many think this worth and 8 rating just shows how shallow and dumb most people are. Perhaps I should go find myself a nice shack in the woods of Montana ....................."

","I use IMDb scores as a pretty good guide to a film. If it's over 8/10 I'm pretty much guaranteed I'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>Not this time. This was the worst film I've seen this year.<br/><br/>The main character was unbearably smug. It was nauseating seeing him almost punch the air at his good fortune, giving it all away and living for the moment. Ho hum, here comes another pan-out on a helicopter. Most of the film felt like an ad but the cans of coke never arrived. In fact ads these days have more conflict in it than this film.<br/><br/>I kept wishing ill on him just so we could have a little tension. Sure, a few parental issues but they loved him very much. The negative should have come out a lot stronger. Instead we are narrated the story by the only character more mawkish than our hero, his sister.<br/><br/>I'm a nature buff who's lived an unconventional life with lots of travel. But really, it took him two years, 2.5 hours of film and endless philosophising to realise that people need company? Come on. Maybe if he had time to watch one Hollywood blockbuster, he would have learned that and we could have all saved ourselves the bother."
"shiningpathbme","3","43","82","13 March 2008"," Cult hero or spoiled, selfish brat?
","I'm amazed at some of the press I've read about this movie an it's main character. I watched the movie because I thought it was going to be about a guy who takes off to live in the wilds of Alaska. I assumed it would be about his preparation and chock full of information about how he did it. I didn't realize it was a true story until the end. Boy was I let down. The entire movie is about some selfish brat who disappeared without so much as a postcard or phone call to his mother or sister. His animosity towards his father might excuse letting dad know about where he was, but his mom and sister? That's about as self centered as you can get, which leads me to doubt the films integrity concerning the family dynamics and Chris's relationship with his father. Whatever his reasons for doing that to Dad, doing it to the rest of his family is sick.<br/><br/>According to the Wikipedia entry, and a couple other articles I've read online, there is absolutely no evidence that he poisoned himself by eating the wrong plant (as depicted in the film). He starved to death, plain and simple, because he wasn't prepared for what he encountered in Alaska. If the filmmaker manufactured that, then perhaps he manufactured a few other things too. One mile from where he tried to cross the river was a manually operated tram he could have used to cross. If he had explored a little, or bothered to bring a map, he would have known about it. Intead of being a wonderful story about a guy going to Alaska to live off the land, it's a story of a self-centered brat, whose parents gave him everything, so he gave his money to charity and disappears without a trace, tearing his family's hearts out. Oh yeah, he had a pretty cool cross country adventure which I'm sure his family would have loved to hear about.<br/><br/>He should have died in the Colorado river, and saved me about 45 minutes of waiting for him to get to the Alaskan wilderness.<br/><br/>Maybe a younger person, or somebody without children, would find something else in this movie. I tried but couldn't do it."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","2","28","51","12 September 2008"," Awful
","How did the bus get there? Of all the questions (pseudo and real) that Sean Penn's latest film, Into The Wild, is so manifestly trying to provoke- and in a semi-retarded hippy-cum-tree hugger sort of way, this most basic and elemental plot point is never addressed. But, more on that later.<br/><br/>The film is based upon the 1996 nonfiction bestseller by Jon Krakauer, about a spoiled rich white suburban boy who basically commits suicide in the Alaskan wilderness, although he is so painfully unaware of the real world that he does not even know his own dark- almost Objectivist, impulses, and where they will lead. The book the film is based upon was a good read, even if one might question the wisdom of making a martyr out of such a delusional narcissist as Christopher Johnson McCandless (Emile Hirsch)- the 24 year old who starved to death on the aforementioned bus, after accidentally poisoning himself with inedible berries, in the middle of Alaska's wilds, after adopting the pseudonym Alexander Supertramp.<br/><br/>The lead character is simply annoyingly repellant- perhaps only Roberto Benigni's lead character, Guido, in the awful Life Is Beautiful, makes a viewer more actively root for the character's death. In that film the lead character is so annoying that one actually roots for the Nazis to kill him, and in this film McCandless is so pompous and the film so long (140 minutes, compared to a book barely over 200 pages) that, at the hour mark, one wishes he'd just die already, so one can vacate the theater. But, no relief will come for over an hour. But, as repellant as Chris McCandless, the character, is, the direction by Sean Penn- in his first truly big budget feature, is ATROCIOUS! Yes, Penn is a great actor, but his direction, and even worse screenplay, make this film a chore. Only some stellar acting, mostly by supporting actors, saves this film from total disaster. That so many people identify and sympathize with this unfortunately deluded and hollow young loser bespeaks how little they even notice themselves, and their own flaws, much less the many other McCandlesses that proliferate in cafes across the nation. Life is as real, both for the good and ill, in a New York City deli, a doctor's waiting room, or in a tenement, as it is on the peak of Mount Everest, riding the tube of a forty foot wave in Hawaii, or trekking through the Amazon. McCandless never learned this for no one seemed to care enough to even try to stop him. Of course, even had they, he was so selfish and uncaring of others' feelings, that he likely would not have been deterred. And, Penn would likely not have cared to make a film about such a character, anyway.<br/><br/>So, given the predetermined mess of this film, I return to the opening query- how did the bus, which the film refers to as 'magic'- thank you to The Who, get there? A Google search reveals the bus was fortuitously left by a highway construction company, decades earlier, to be used as a waystation for hikers, hunters, and campers. Since everything else in this film is so obvious, I just thought you'd want to know that and, also, to avoid this film. Thank me later."
"moody308","3","36","68","20 December 2007"," Sean Penn Sold Chris McCandless's Soul
","I felt Krakauer's story was compelling enough. For Sean Penn to throw such fictionalized crap into the mix, it is hard to accept.<br/><br/>McCandless was barely developed as a character and what we see is a very self-absorbed, humorless, one-dimensional kid. Penn's anti-government views are unnecessarily thrown into the movie--the rude ranger at Lee's Ferry and the sheriff's boat blasting their siren through the Grand Canyon, unable to catch up to a kayaker, sure. The idea of McCandless pushing his kayak on a shopping cart 42 miles from Page to Lee's Ferry was also absurd. The whole kayak-through-the-Grand-Canyon story line was totally unfathomable. How many idiots will try it now? As was Wayne Westerberg getting busted by the FBI (for what--driving his combine too fast? Why does Vince Vaughn have to be in every goddamn movie?), McCandless burning all his money yet holding on to his gold watch, (all vagabonds who are rejecting society need to know the exact time), McCandless riding the rails, (stereotypical ""bull"" encounter--but did McCandless ever hop a train? I don't think so), McCandless not giving Ron a hug or at least a handshake when he said goodbye to him, McCandless hiking up his belt another notch about fifty times (must be losing weight, duh), McCandless not having a discernible personality, McCandless about to phone his parents but thinking the better of it (what was the point of that?) Also hard to believe was McCandless not banging the Tracy chick (Tolstoy would have banged her!) This must be Penn's version of McCandless deification, that he was too ""moral"" to bang a hot chick in the middle of the desert.<br/><br/>The hippie couple and Tracy were good actors. Hal Holbrook, good to see he's still alive. Emile Hirsch at least looked like McCandless, good to see Sean Penn didn't turn him into a Haitian stowaway or a guy with scissorhands. Hard to understand why he was mugging for the camera, though. The whacked-out Danish couple on remote beach seemed realistic. There are lots of nude and nearly nude European tourists running around remote parts of the American west. That was the movie's biggest connection with me.<br/><br/>Eddie Vedder's soundtrack was totally forgettable. You suck, dude. I guess we should be thankful Helen Reddy wasn't Sean Penn's buddy in the music industry, eh? Too bad no ""Travelin' Man""/Bob Seger, ""Ramble On""/Led Zep, even some old '70's Jackson Browne or '60's Byrds would have helped. And since McCandless was out there during the pinnacle of the grunge era, some music from that period also seemed required. ""King of the Road""/Roger Miller was the only tune that fit.<br/><br/>McCandless in LA, McCandless catching a train out of LA, McCandless getting beat up by the ""bull"", McCandless having a weird Sean Penn moment where he imagines he is Leonardo DiCaprio at a Hollywood party ... I doubt any of those things ever actually happened. And like I said, I thought the original story was compelling enough.<br/><br/>Good to see The Gap (S of Page) and the road leading down to Lee's Ferry on the big screen, but I doubt McCandless ever went down it. There wasn't any particular shot that came close to capturing the real essence of hitching, and what a freaking shame. McCandless can't even say ""thanks for the ride"". Stunning how Sean Penn can make a movie about the most famous hitchhiker of our lifetime and not have even one consultant on the set who has ever hitched.<br/><br/>The scene where McCandless mocks elderly man Ron for not making the ""most"" of his life left a particularly bad taste in my mouth. If someone puts you up overnight for an extended time and wants to adopt you, be gracious about it, not a sanctimonious jerk. I'm sure Chris McCandless' parents were thrilled to see their son depicted this way.<br/><br/>Also hard to believe is that no one came forward during the making of the movie to further clarify McCandless' journey. No rides in Canada, nothing. Rather than fictionalize what may have happened that Krakauer didn't unearth in his research, Penn fictionalizes what did happen. In reality, McCandless kayaked from below Parker Dam to the Sea of Cortez through relatively tame Colorado River waters. Penn has him negotiating class 4 rapids in the heart of the Grand Canyon--a total sell-out to attract the extreme sport crowd.<br/><br/>Closing shot totally ridiculous. The river looks to be about ankle deep, and it's flowing from the wrong direction. No attempt by McCandless to even cross the river. What a joke.<br/><br/>From what I read, McCandless in real life was a congenial guy, a great bar person. He had a joie de vivre for hitching and meeting other people. He wasn't the single-minded, Alaska-obsessed prick that Penn makes him out as being. That's what I choose to believe. Shame on Sean Penn for not illuminating us more as to who Chris McCandless actually was.<br/><br/>Krakauer's version of ending with Billie and Walt McCandless helicoptering in to visit the bus was gut-wrenching enough for me. Too bad it wasn't good enough for Sean Penn, that great Hollywood visionary."

","I went into this film knowing nothing about it apart from its synopsis thinking that this would turn out to be a good film, and for the first 15-20 minutes it looked that way. However, the longer this film went on, the more apparent it became that the central character was essentially a ''man child"" who takes the literature he reads too literally. Throughout the film, he makes countless of irresponsible and reckless decisions that go against what the film portrays him to believe making it more difficult to relate or sympathize with him. His actions mirrored that of a teenager and its worrying that the majority of the public see him as an inspiration. And the irony to how this film ends! This is essentially a character study of a man who is ignorant, destructive and bratty. <br/><br/>Simply put. If you want to be seriously vexed after watching the most misguided 2 and a half hours of film ever put together, by all means watch this. It puzzles me how this is in the top 250 list."

","As far as I can see, this movie was and is pandering to people with their heads in the clouds, who will think movie is great, and that Christopher McCandless is some sort of idealized, wilderness casualty. Christopher was a bad planner, a bad organizer, a bad hunter, and a really bad navigator. I almost believe he had a suicide mission, (which later I believe he changed his mind about, but it simply was too late, and he knew this fact with desperation), doing this trip without any of the things he needed. Christopher was educated, smart, so there is no excuse for his actions concerning this venture of his into the wilderness. Delirious starvation, led to not finding a river crossing. Bad circumstances made food in cabins nearby not edible. One of his last entries in his diary made it clear he was afraid to die, to die alone, and that he was desperate to live, but hopeless at the same time. He should have had a compass in his travels, but he did not have one at the time of his death in his possession, which does puzzle me. People will always go where angels fear to tread. One can only hope other people won't make bad decisions to go on trips unprepared, but some people always will, so one can only hope the best for those people, and hope no one follows their footsteps to their death also."
"Hawkensian","6","6","8","12 June 2011"," McCandless was a self-serving fool, and the narrative suffers because of this
","This film was recommended to me by a couple of friends, I was looking forward to it, it had an interesting premise on face value, but by not even half-way through, the film had lost its appeal for me purely because of the ostensibly 'inspirational' material it was based on.<br/><br/>I have backpacked around Europe and South East Asia, I wholeheartedly understand the appeal of travelling for extended periods of time and living out of a rucksack. I also, like many others I'm sure, can empathise with McCandless's contempt for expectations, uncertainty and pressure of young adulthood. But, quite frankly, McCandless was a selfish fool who lost all sense of rationality whilst making a grand statement about civilised society. He left his only sister with their emotionally distant, shallow and contentious parents to pursue his ill-fated adventure totally unprepared. So unfortunately, I couldn't see past the lead character's naivety and self importance. <br/><br/>But despite this, I did find myself compelled to watch McCandless' interaction with the film's supporting cast; the hippies, old man Ron Hanz and dare I say it even Kristen Stewart's role were infinitely more interesting than McCandless' 'inspiring' mission. To think some viewers find his story 'inspirational' shows entertainingly poor judgement, they can't have seen the whole film! Again, I stress that this film isn't bad film making, it features good performances from the whole cast and some good emotive interplay between them, but it is all set within the context of the lead character's idiotic escapade, a fundamental aspect which I cannot bypass. <br/><br/>It's a shame that McCandless has been immortalised for being so reckless.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

","i'm going to resist giving my opinion here on this guys actions, because it's not my place to do so and because most of this movie is fiction sown together by some facts.. what we know is: Christopher, graduated, went travelling (like thousands of graduates do every year), naturally met some people along the way, and died on his travels<br/><br/>we know very little about his behaviour, his motivations, the order of his writings, his past, his plans for the future or the reasons for his death although it seems that he intended to be in Alaska for just a few months before moving on perhaps to a life of perpetual travel or a life as a rich lawyer who can say. it does appear that he made a pretty bloody remarkable kayaking trip which I'd like to know more about and which should perhaps have been the focus of the film <br/><br/>i would expect that the main character had a love of nature, and i found this was totally lost in this movie. the wild is pretty much depicted as being alien, hostile, claustrophobic, and something merely there to be conquered. i didn't feel at any moment that Penn has a love of nature. surely it needs to be at the heart of this movie otherwise we risk describing a person without purpose. <br/><br/>i actually found that Penn revels in this concept, and paints his romantic notion of a nihilistic central character. maybe his interpretation is right, maybe it's wrong. but either way going to Alaska is clearly a big deal for the guy, so why not show us more joy instead of focusing on his death and rewinding from that point? <br/><br/>given the lack of concrete information i wonder why this movie was made as a factual account. it would have been more sensible to leave it alone and make a movie about all those fabulous people, perhaps like Christopher, that go travelling with purpose and end up doing something very special instead of tragically starving to death alone in a broken bus"

","Saw this movie last night with BAFTA - before I go any further, let me just say that the cinematography is amazingly beautiful and ""big"".<br/><br/>The comments from another reviewer about the ""shocking random human nudity"" baffled me. If you would find the brief sight of a flaccid willy, a topless female sunbather and a 2-second distance shot of a bunch of naturists shocking, then beware! But there was nothing of a sexual nature, and nothing I would not allow my 6 year old grandson to see.<br/><br/>Other than the above comments, I am afraid I have mainly negatives.<br/><br/>This is the story of a privileged young college graduate who studied various calamities in Africa as part of his schooling. His only personal calamity is that he has parents who have been less than truthful to him about their family history, and who have the audacity to argue in front of him during his childhood. He appears to want some personal angst so badly that he uses this to fuel his requirement for his own ""personal issues"".<br/><br/>In order to ""understand his true nature"" (yuk!) he drops out of the education system and goes walkabout in the wilds - another prime motive for which appears to be to punish his parents for their sin of being less than truthful to him during his upbringing.<br/><br/>I do not think a European audience will warm to the story of such a self-indulgent, cruel character who appears to have no empathy for the people he emotionally hurts, and at 150 minutes I almost felt I had gone through a trial equal to that undergone by the character in the film.<br/><br/>What I also do not get is the big deal about living in the wilderness - replete with hunter's rifle, gas lighters and various other technological accoutrements including a derelict bus. Again, another America-centric theme: this time of ""frontiersmanship"" I would suggest.<br/><br/>Finally, I would say that the lack of empathy I felt for the character meant that the narrative did not touch me or make me care about his fate - and the way Emile Hirsch occasionally played to the camera, like a fly-on-the-wall reality show, broke the spell of ""suspending belief"" that is so critical in allowing yourself to be immersed in the story - it suddenly reminded me that I was merely watching a film All-in-all, I would recommend steering clear."

","Screenplay writer and director of Into the Wild, Sean Penn, has been quoted as having the following to say about Terence Malick's 2011 film ""The Tree Of Life""... ""The screenplay is the most magnificent one I've ever read but I couldn't find that same emotion on screen, a more conventional narrative would have helped the film"". This maybe quite so, but perhaps similar could also be said of his film. As with Malick, Penn extends his subject material till it reaches breaking point and becomes tedious.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems for the subject in this case, is Christopher McCandless, a top Emory Uni student who in a moment of teen angst gives away all his savings, leaves his family without even a word of goodbye and heads out into the dangerous wilds towards Alaska. Sadly, this in itself is immaturity at the height of its ignorance. He's fleeing from parents who seem to disagree between themselves (as seen from the viewpoint of his youthful inexperience of marital problems), they don't understand him (but support his everyday existence needs) and a sister he is supposed to care very much for. <br/><br/>Christopher foolishly casts his only remaining money into a fire, then blindly stumbles from one bad situation to the next - eventually having to take jobs with fast food outlets in several failed attempts to support himself. This all goes on interminably for 2 1/2 Hrs. While the landscapes are handsomely captured by documentary photographer Eric Gautier (this feature would have actually been better suited to a 1 Hr TV documentary), it rambles on until our hapless traveler manages to kill himself eating poisonous berries. <br/><br/>There are the customary message songs of troubled youth to pad out the moments lacking in solid story. Sadly these songs tend to sound a little tired and lacking conviction. This is not entirely surprising, as talented singer songwriter Eddie Vedder, had earlier written a song called 'Jeremy' about the foolishness of running from your problems and killing yourself instead of standing up and changing things! Wise words. In the performance stakes, Hal Holbrook fares best as a caring, aged widower who befriends Christopher (who in turn proceeds to lecture the old man about getting more out of his life). Today's youth sure do get a bellyful of life long experience at an incredibly early age! The reliable William Hurt looks very well preserved as Chris's Dad. <br/><br/>Christopher, ultimately destroyed his family, along with all the positive things he could have contributed to by living. I, like many, also left home, went through all this desperate youthful searching but figured it's better to come out on the other side and contribute to bettering life one way or other. Yes, it's a sad situation but now Mr Penn wants us to spend hours feeling sorry for this wasted foolishness.<br/><br/>It's somehow difficult to appreciate the accolades dished out to this work by the Academy and some critics who, on a closer look, probably should know better. From the look of numerous other viewer comments, appears I may not be alone."
"dragokin","2","4","5","16 May 2013"," questionable message
","I've seen Into the Wild without prior knowledge of the topic apart from the fact that Sean Penn directed it. Therefore my review is based on what i've seen and not what i've learned while researching afterward.<br/><br/>Sean Penn has always been known as a rebel, sometimes with and sometimes without a cause. Christopher McCandless, the main character of the movie, was hardheaded, as well, which presumably caught his attention.<br/><br/>The movie has been made during George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States. Sean Penn has been dissatisfied with his administration and very vocal about it. Therefore there might be a cryptic message that people like Christopher McCandless built the United States. They were valiant individuals (and individualists) who gave their best to fulfill their dreams of a better life. And what time is better to send this message than before the elections...<br/><br/>Despite art-house ambition, Into the Wild is rather mainstream in it's essence. The main character travels across the United States and even changes several lives on his way. Although i wouldn't agree with his relation to reality the movie was still watchable.<br/><br/>However, at the moment when Christopher McCandless moves into the wilderness, the message of the movie became questionable. He didn't only go without a map, but almost without provisions. Yet, it was still his choice to do so. But the movie goes one step further and implies that it is alright to pursue your dreams, even if you put your life in danger.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Eddie Vedder fits wells into the movie, although i'm no fan of his and wouldn't listen to it again."

His refusal to have sex with Kristen Stewart's character is ludicrous. Getting to the young man's motivation for taking off on his adventure, the story he learned about his parents is barely enough to trigger anything more than underachieving in school. The fact that he's a high achiever with knowledge of his parents' hypocrisy is not credible. Yes, the acting is excellent and so is the cinematography. But the script is a shambles. In his adult period, I believe, he kills a moose, and because he doesn't dress it fast enough maggots appear, ruining it. And so he gives up on shooting game. This is the same person who shot the rapids in a kayak without permission and a deathly fear of water?

Do we need to teach our children that this is the way they should thing and approach life? Definitely no. On the other hand if you look at it as a drama, as a mere interpretation of a real story you'll find it likable. Not epic. Not the kind of movie that you will remember but still a good one.

","I can't believe that this movie is among the top 250 list of IMDb. With so many true stories that are really worthy for a movie, they come with this garbage of a man who just wants to be a bum and how great it is. This movie just embraced the idea of being homeless. Into The Wild, tells the story of Chris McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch), a kid who just graduated from college and decides to go on a trip throughout the wilderness, with no money, no phone, and clearly no responsibilities. On his journey he meets with hippies, criminals and all kinds of trash, which obviously, didn't help Chris develop any sense of responsibility. The writers try to present Chris McCandless as a brilliant college student, who is always reading books about philosophy and nature. In the end he ends up alone, insane, and dead. Sean Penn tries to justify the character actions by portraying a supposedly dysfunctional family. In reality, the character of McCandless is just a spoil brat that just doesn't want to face the realities of life and decides to run away from it. The director tries to enchant the audience by showing visuals of mountains and wilderness but that doesn't hide the fact that this movie is a terrible one. The film massage is clear from the beginning, ""love humans, but love nature more."" What type of nonsense is that? It's amazing what some people will do for nature, but won't even move a muscle to help their peers. <br/><br/>The movie is depressing and plain terrible. But if you are the hippie type, hate having to pay the mortgage on time, or don't like to have any responsibilities, well you'll definitely love this movie and even might identify with the character."

","""Into the Wild,"" has the ingredients that should lead to a good film; a talented cast, an Oscar-winning actor at the helm, and what should be the compelling story of a young man who left everything behind to find himself in the wilderness. Unfortunately, the movie is marred by several problems. One of them is the two hour and twenty minute running time. The film would greatly benefit if it were trimmed by thirty minutes. There are constant shots of Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless, standing on top of a mountain, bus, anything he can stand on and spreading his arms towards the sky. The film is also weighed down by an overly dramatic, pretentious voice over that reminds the viewer they're watching a movie every time they hear it. Sean Penn's direction is at times heavy-handed and self-conscious, which is surprising coming from an actor as gifted as Penn. Emile Hirsch is appealing but his performance has a self-awareness in certain key scenes that are meant to illuminate what drives Christopher. This is especially apparent in the scene with his parents, played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden, the first encounter with Catherine Keener's character, and the bar scene with Vince Vaughn. I have not read the book on which the movie is based, but probably the biggest flaw with the film is that Christopher McCandless comes off as a spoiled, self-righteous, whiner. The people Christopher meets along his journey, however briefly, are infinitely more interesting and engaging than he is. The best part of the movie, and the most meaningful, is the section with Hal Holbrook, who does a beautiful job. It's a shame the rest of the movie is not as seamless and unaffected. I know there are people who will find this film to be profound, and they are correct. It is profoundly boring and in love with itself."

","This movie is hardly deserving of the rave reviews it has received. This shallow movie has no point, the main character has no redeeming qualities, and though this movie has a lesson, it is so sorely obvious it is not worth watching the entire movie to figure out.<br/><br/>The movie is a jumble of random events and flashbacks from a troubled boy's journey to Alaska. He meets some hippies, works at a few fast food joints, and lectures an old man who lost everything about the meaning of life. The events are broken up, scattered, poorly written dialogs and clichés and full of dead spots where the ""protagonist"" is simply sitting there in a filthy condition which is meant to represent his hard and meaningless journey.<br/><br/>The main character has no purpose. He is simply a deeply troubled intellectual whose family completely messed up. It can be described as a soap opera: His father left a previous marriage to marry his mistress who is already pregnant with this story's main character, during the time which the movie takes place, his parents are currently thinking of divorce, and he is so deluded and depressed he thinks he can take on the Alaskan wilderness and find some deeper meaning to life outside the populated world which he views as more twisted and false than he is. Summarized: the main character is so arrogant that he thinks he can do anything.<br/><br/>The lesson of this movie?: Don't go into the Wilderness. Ever. Especially if you are a demented kid with no training or experience. Countless people told him he would, with 99.99% certainty, die. He dies. No one saves him. Not even the books. Here's what the main character learns and advises: Call everything by its proper name. Wow, I am so inspired.<br/><br/>However, I gave it a two. Why?

A hero!?

He is arrogant, not very bright, and inconsiderate of others. Watching a film about a jerk -- especially a long film that seems aimed at lionizing him -- is difficult.

"kevaughn2","2","5","7","16 August 2014"," A bad movie about a bad person
","First off, no disrespect to the actual people portrayed in this film. I don't know them, and I haven't read the book on which this film is based. Therefore, I'm writing this solely about the impression I had of these individuals after seeing the film.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positive things I can say about the film. I think Emile Hirsch did a fine job in this role. You can see his dedication play out on the screen and he gives the character a believable quality. Also, the nature shots and scenery were at times beautiful.<br/><br/>Now let's go onto the negative things. <br/><br/>1) The film did nothing to make me care about the supposed ""hero"". In fact, he's downright annoying, selfish, and hypocritical. He flees his home on a nature quest because he no longer wants to participate in society. We see flashbacks of his parents being abusive to each other, and the narration tells us that the parents often put the kids in the middle of it all. <br/><br/>I realize people can have pretty awful childhoods, but was his really that bad? The parents clearly were trying to do right in the present day (they attended his graduation and offered to buy him a new car!). People go through a lot worse and do not try to solve their problems by running away. It really made me feel like the main character was a spoiled brat who read a few literary classics about surviving in the wild, threw a tantrum and just ran away. I cannot sympathize with this character. I did not feel connected to this character. I actually rather disliked this character. He accuses society of being hurtful and people being so mean to each other, yet he seems completely unaware of how his actions have lead his family to suffer (particularly his sister, who REALLY did nothing to deserve it). It's really selfish and totally naive. At the same time, he offers advice to others about what life is all about. This guy didn't have a clue what life was about. He didn't have a clue how much pain he caused his family. He didn't realize how selfish his actions were. <br/><br/>I didn't realize until after the film ended that this movie was based on a true story. I feel very sorry for the family whom had to deal with this, and there may be more to the story that is left out of the movie. But as far as I'm concerned having just seen the movie, this guy seems absolutely crazy and rather horrible to cause so many people so much suffering (not to mention the police, state, and government resources wasted on trying to locate him).<br/><br/>2) I don't think the film can decide what it wants to be. Is it a nature flick? Is it a documentary? Is it a drama piece? It tries to be everything and misses on all accounts. This is not to say that there aren't good moments in the film. For instance, I rather liked the interactions the main character had with others on his nature quest. Yet, that's a minor part of the film. Most of the movie is just Emile Hirsch running around in the wilderness, and it's kind of boring. The film runs on about 45 minutes longer than it should have. For fun, try fast forwarding through the movie at 10x. You'll notice you can still catch almost everything that's happening. It's THAT redundant.<br/><br/>3) Horrible narration throughout the movie. The main character's sister does not have a good narrating voice, and the narration seemed almost unnecessary. <br/><br/>I could go on to say more, but it's not really worth it. I think there's too much to be grateful for in life to behave like the main character did. Maybe that's the point of the ending - that he came to the conclusion that he was wrong about life? It's not clear, but what is clear is that it was too late to get me to care about him or the movie."
"Lechuguilla","Null","15","28","16 April 2008"," Mr. Penn's Grand Opus
","Deeply thematic, the story of a young man's wilderness experience is rendered compelling because the events really happened. Non-fiction is usually more potent than contrived fiction. And in this case the story's climax packs quite a dramatic punch. Mostly as a result of how the story ends, viewers are bound to come away with strong opinions about the idealistic protagonist, Chris McCandless, and his quest for truth. As such, ""Into The Wild"" works, but only because the real life events force you to think.<br/><br/>That said, it's been quite some time since I have endured a movie wherein the film direction was so annoying. You would think that Director Sean Penn would fashion a low-key, restrained film in sync with McCandless' disdain for money and showy materialism. No such luck.<br/><br/>Penn constructs a two and a half hour grand opus, bombastic in tone and smug in its philosophical righteousness. The main character is portrayed as some modern day spiritual guru endowed with miraculous insight. Penn hangs on every word the guru says. The film's plot structure is unnecessarily convoluted as if to suggest profundity. Camera work is gimmicky and flashy. And the soundtrack is overbearing. In short, McCandless' genuinely moving real life story provides the opportunistic Penn with a chance to display his flair for showmanship.<br/><br/>With all that ostentation and excess, the film screams out for recognition. It's as if Sean Penn is campaigning for every cinematic award in the books. I would thus argue that ""Into The Wild"" is not so much about Chris McCandless as it is about ... Sean Penn.<br/><br/>I normally like outdoor adventure stories and films based on real life events. But I found this film something of an ordeal to sit through. The basic story is quite compelling. And much of the film's scenery is gorgeous. Both casting and acting are quite acceptable, especially the performance of the always reliable Hal Holbrook. But the film's direction is so distracting in a tacitly self-congratulatory way, I don't think I could sit through it again."

","I really wanted to connect with this movie. The young hero who tries to find a ""pure"" way of living and dies tragically is actually one of my favorite archetypes. So is the rebel who breaks the rules.<br/><br/>The irony is that director and writer Sean Penn -- a real life bad boy if ever there was one -- really has no idea how to create a bad boy that audiences can like or respect or even understand. In COOL HAND Luke, one shot of Paul Newman sawing the heads off parking meters sets the tone for the whole film. Luke is a victim, but he doesn't act like one. He's cool, (hence the nickname) and he has a sense of humor, even if the world around him doesn't.<br/><br/>In this movie there are some great performances and beautiful scenery. But the hero never quite comes across as what Sean Penn wants him to be. He's going for a sort of Christlike spiritual wanderer, but what comes across is a petulant rich-kid punk. When young ""Alexander Supertramp"" (they don't make rebel nicknames like they used to) burns his money, he comes across as more clueless and spoiled than clever and rebellious. Same with not wearing socks to work. And breaking sensible public safety rules wherever he goes. And dying like a dog in the middle of nowhere. Over and over, Sean Penn keeps asking us to see something that just ain't there. This Messiah literally has no clothes.<br/><br/>And yet . . . I have to say that something about this movie moved me. It's important to show the world that there are privileged, educated young men who destroy themselves simply because money and privilege themselves are not enough. A college degree and good grades do not confer any real wisdom, any sense of purpose, or any real self-esteem. This movie gets that much right. Sean Penn makes a real point even while hammering home a false one.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's terribly annoying the way the parents in this movie are such one-dimensional baddies. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden are totally wasted. Sean Penn is fifty or more years old, yet he still thinks like an angry teenager where parents are concerned. Really he should have just broken out Charlie Brown's old muted trumpet. (Waah waah waah -- wah wah!) and had the parents just be off-stage voices.<br/><br/>And I'm not even going to talk about using the incomparably gifted Jena Malone as a mere ""narrator."" When a gifted young actress has the most beautiful, soulful, intelligent and expressive eyes in the world, you want her ON screen, emoting, not off stage reading from file cards.<br/><br/>Now as an English major, I can't end this review without mentioning the insufferable literary name-dropping. Again and again we're told that our heroic dimwit is crazy for Jack London. But it's really obvious that he never read ""To Build A Fire"" or absorbed the message about what happens to careless, stupid people in the wild. Whether you vote this review helpful or not, please go read this terrifying classic tale. It makes an unforgettable point that this confused movie completely fails to grasp."

","I came into this movie knowing nothing about the true story behind it, only that it was well received by critics, Hal Holbrook got an Oscar nomination, and Eddie Vedder did some cool songs for the soundtrack. Little did I know I was about to watch what happens when a spoiled 22 year old goes off the deep end because he hates his parents. There are people who romanticize his tale, but it's all essentially a cliché: young person thinks they have life all figured out and slowly learns the hard way that they don't have the first clue. Nothing insightful that was gained was worth his life, and I have no doubt had he lived he would have regretted how foolish and reckless he had been."

"maya-maya","3","6","9","1 November 2012"," Ultimately pointless
","You will see a lot of reviews here of people calling this movie ""left wing bullsh!t"", and maybe you'll think, ""well, I'm left wing, so I'll probably like it"". So let me preface this by saying I'm as liberal as they come.<br/><br/>I've seen movies with bad acting, and bad effects, and bad writing, but this movie suffers from a bad underlying message, and there's no way to overlook that.<br/><br/>This is story of a privileged young man, 'Alexander Supertramp' who leaves his family and burns his last bit of cash because he feels that 'people are mean to each other' and he can't live in society anymore. Instead of trying to change society though, he decides to leave it completely - but hold on, not that completely.<br/><br/>You see, while he complains about life being too easy after cashing a cheque for work he did, he's shaved, clean, wearing different clothes that all mysteriously fit into his backpack, with nice sparkling teeth and not even one little cold (until the very end). He's both still buying his way through life and mooching off people who actually need money and goods - for example the residents of Slab City, the Colorado campsite. The girl he meets there is a character I can actually feel sympathy for; she obviously wants to leave and would if she could. Their relationship is a mystery - not because he doesn't want to have sex with her, but because he doesn't even seem to like her.<br/><br/>And finally, I have to agree with many of the other posters here who call Alex's trip to Alaska reckless and stupid. For all his supposed knowledge and ability to learn, he completely failed to prepare for this trip. If the older man he was living with at the end hadn't given him some supplies, and had he not found the bus, he probably would not have lasted two weeks. At one point it becomes obvious that even though he could fish and had a book on local flora, he had never before used it, relying on wildlife he shot.<br/><br/>His final 'wisdom', that happiness is worthless if not shared, is ultimately pointless.<br/><br/>One scene in particular stands out as representative of the whole movie: Alex, apparently on a routine food run and not too close to his camp, sees an adult moose and immediately shoots it. Nevermind that the moose is clearly too much meat even if he manages to preserve it (which he never learned), or to drag back to the camp, or that he does not have his 'how to skin and prepare game' manual with him - he sees the huge moose and shoots it. In the end, he doesn't get one bite of food out of it."
"Jordan_Haelend","2","6","9","10 March 2012"," Okay, what's good about this movie?
","The lovely scenery. That's it.<br/><br/>This is Sean Penn's valentine to a dead, spoiled rich boy-brat's pretensions. Nothing more. McCandless was a cold hearted, selfish creature who seems to have thought that everything should be all about his wants and needs. He whined about how sick our twisted society was and made no attempt to correct anything. He simply scooted off into the back country, where he traveled about, got beaten up, and finally died a needless, useless death.<br/><br/>The one person I found interesting was the railroad bull. Undoubtedly, we were meant to see him as a violent, savage support for the evil old society That Poor Chrissy so righteously despises. I've worked on a railroad and the bulls know what they're up against: many of these freeloaders are not the cheery, story telling hobos of yor-- many are ruthless professional criminals who will kill somebody for five bucks. The bull doesn't necessarily enjoy what he does but he does it because it must be done to protect the railroad, us (think of the merchandise you buy that travels by train,) himself and yes, idiots like Hirsch's McCandless, who never think of how dangerous riding the rails can be.<br/><br/>And in the end, the movie McCandless' journey ended as did the odyssey of the real one-- a miserable, pointless death in the middle of nowhere. <br/><br/>One thing that amuses me is how Chris' worshipers like to blather about how, unlike so many of us, he wasn't content with the 9-5 routine in our allegedly sick society, he lived his life the way he wanted, the way it was meant to be lived, etc., as if the path he took is the only authentic one. And of course, the ones who rant the loudest against our technological society in the process do so while using a computer to post on the Internet. Thus proving that they are hypocritical fools perfectly matched to the arrogant McCandless, a kid with very little to be arrogant about."
"diac228","8","6","9","5 June 2010"," Like life itself, Into the Wild is a wild and beautiful flower with some nasty thorns attached
","The best stories are those that even the greatest novelists couldn't make up. Real life, the real world creates some incredible adventures led by incredible characters. In this film, we follow one of the most amazing true stories ever captured on film. Into the Wild is a very deep and engaging one-man trip through the unknown portions of the United States. Based off the best-seller written by John Krakauer, Into the Wild is about a man that gives up all his material possessions and life altogether in search of purpose, in search of happiness, and in search of a direction to head towards in his life. Written and directed by Sean Penn with a lot of love and detail, this movie is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and even though the third act drags quite a bit, you'll remain hooked on Christopher McCandless' travels up until the bitter end. <br/><br/>In case you had not read the startling true story, Christopher McCandless was a very gifted athlete and student with high marks and an extremely bright future. But, spiritually, he was extremely lost; emotionally, he was empty. Upon this, he donates all his money to charity and runs away from his family, his college, everything he had worked for. Now, whatever your stance is on his decision-making, we can all agree he was clearly a man that was lost, and needed to be found. You can be unhappy for only so long before you decide to do something drastic. Some move to another city, some pursue a new career, some search for love. In his case, he chose to become one with nature. Like I said, you can question his common sense and decisions, but don't question his desire for something more. Sean Penn and John Krakeuer clearly admired the emotional strength and bravery of our main character, as they infused his story with a lot of love, a lot of content, and a lot of overall emotion.<br/><br/>The main core and best element in this film is the overall acting. While not one performance stood out, everyone did an exceptional job. Emile Hirsch does a spectacular job portraying a strong-willed yet spiritually lost man hellbent on achieving true happiness. The smaller roles (people Christopher meets during his journey) added charm to the overall flick, including Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, Hal Halbrook, and Catherine Keener. The writing supported the acting, as not one line sounds forced or shoved upon, and it adds an added layer of realism to the already-true story. <br/><br/>The directing however is a bit of a mixed bag. Sean Penn really loved this story and definitely displayed it with the elongated running time, insistence on shooting every scene on location, and the artsy final moments; but sometimes the French-style directing was a bit too much. There are instances in which the characters look at the camera and make faces or pose, and that totally breaks down the fourth wall and throws you away from the main structure of the film. You realize it's a movie and not a story when the main character glares at the camera for a few split seconds. Then the final act, when the climax drags, hinders the overall quality of the movie. Approximately ten minutes could have been cut from the last third and it would have been fine. <br/><br/>Finally, we have the controversial element of morality. Sometimes, moral codes amongst each of us prevent us from sympathizing with the main character, leading to some issues. A recent example is Sex and the City's first movie's final act, which results in us totally losing sympathy for the main four (with the exception of one, but avoiding spoilers). Into the Wild also suffers from this. While we can clearly understand and see the frustrations of Christopher against the world we live in, his actions are heavily on the selfish side, despite what he's gone through. <br/><br/>Instead of seeing a man that has suffered through the childhood and teenage years and needed to escape everything, we see a person so closed-minded on his journey that he shuts off all the people that cared about him throughout his trip. All the offers of help he received, and he practically shuns them all (especially the final human encounter, in an especially gut-wrenching scene). Upon seeing this, the viewer knows how he is going to end up. And whether or not you'll feel sorry for him is entirely up to you, the witness to all his decisions.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Enjoy the journey, even if the destination and bumps on the road is going to create some discussions and disagreeing points. Into the Wild is a wonderful film that is beautifully shot, despite the direction being misguided at some instances. Once you get past the questionable directing though, prepare for a visually stimulating trip chronicling the adventures of a man on a self-discovery expedition like nothing else seen before on film. While this movie will not convince you to do what he did, it will lead you to questions concerning fulfillment, love, faith, and happiness. Into the Wild is about a journey in search of answers, and despite it being a beautifully flawed (mildly) flick, it does lead to more questions. Great movie to emotionally digest, just do it slowly.<br/><br/>P.S. Where on earth is Eddie Vedder's Oscar for his musical contribution?"
"zaferrana","1","7","11","1 September 2011"," The Lumiere Bros are turning in graves ... from boredom
","I should have seen it coming for I had been invited to see this movie by a friend whose taste in ""cinematography"" is ... let's say peculiar.<br/><br/>So, he tells me that there is a movie which touched him so deeply that not only has he seen it downloaded from the web but he is also planning to go to the movies. Wow, me thinks. That must be something good (knowing how cheap he is). So that alone was a pretty good recommendation, apart form the thousand of stories heard from my friend how now he wants to quit his job and go ""into the wild"".<br/><br/>Nothing more misleading. ""Into the wild"" is simply not a good movie. Why?<br/><br/>*** It is boring and inconsistent ***<br/><br/>Too long. Too slow (leave it to Europe). Too naive (seriously? a true story?) Too bleak ... The plot has potential, can't deny that. But not boredom makes a movie masterpiece. <br/><br/>*** The protagonist makes me do a self-lobotomy ***<br/><br/>Seriously? Leave everything to became a bum? If you want to contest the system there are plenty of options far better than harvesting or choosing the ugliest place on earth to settle. Not convincing (yes, yes I know that this is a true story - but no need to film it)<br/><br/>*** The nature presented in the flick is ugly ***<br/><br/>I blame you Sean Penn for showing your country in the worst light possible. I have seen lots of movies, pictures, images, photos depicting this part of America and it seems very harsh but beautiful.

","If I were granting stars on the basis of the story of Chris McCandless and his ""personal journey,"" I would only be giving this film one star (or less, if I could.) However, I have to admit that Penn did put together a good-looking movie, so I gave it a couple extra stars.<br/><br/>On the flip-side of Penn's work, is...crap. (I'm going to assume that everyone knows the basics of the McCandless story and is at least aware of Krakauer's excellent book.) Penn has made some very poor decisions in his direction. The voice-over narration by Jena Malone as McCandless's sister is irritating and completely unnecessary. Penn's general attitude about the government, society, and the place of personal self-discovery is pushed in your face, all the more curious considering how much he owes his personal success to the people he is apparently angry with. (Just how many of the inevitably kind, honest, and friendly hippie-types/free-spirits in this film are likely to have invested in producing his films or even bothered buying tickets to see them?) <br/><br/>I also have to make a leap of faith here and assume that Penn in some way admires, or at least empathizes with, McCandless's personal quest and is trying to show us that there is at least something that is worthwhile about it. If this is true, then Penn has really screwed up as a director, since McCandless is actually portrayed as a self-indulgent, narcissistic, ego-centered, foolish, and totally unpleasant young man. (I guess my theory is wrong if Penn actually INTENDED to depict McCandless in this way.) <br/><br/>Overall, an average movie about a person who doesn't deserve one. (Read Krakauer's book, as it is much more rewarding and, in fact, more neutral in its tone.)"

","Culture is an ethereal abstract thing you can't quite pin down, and yet it's such a pivotal player in our life. Culture is the context for almost everything you do especially everything we do socially with other people. Chris Mccandless understood that consciousness is purely a solo activity. You can't increase consciousness through culture. Your ability to self-actualize will only come down to your inner work. Consciousness will not grow in a group environment because it produces all the classic mechanical symptoms of a cult. Fundamentally society is trying to take consciousness, and trying to distribute it to the masses through a culture mechanism, and that always makes it mechanical. It suffocates consciousness, and that's the problem.<br/><br/>The most significant cult you got to be afraid of is not those little cults it's the massive cult.

As a result, he decides to dump his money, dump his car, and travel, as a tramp, losing himself by looking for himself. He heads, in a round-about-way, for Alaska where he can live alone.<br/><br/>Supertramp's sister provides various narrations throughout the film trying to understand why he disappeared as he did -- and gets it -- after reflecting on their family life together.<br/><br/>Not examined is the parental perspective -- worried and concerned -- at times fearing that Chris is dead, but not wanting to bear the fact that he wanted to disappear and they are or were at least partly to blame.<br/><br/>While the film is enjoyable as we follow the adventures of Chris, it is unbearable to see this story from the parent's mindset. Chris is selfish, self-centered, and immature, and never thinks of how his parents may feel not knowing whether Chris is dead or alive, suffering somewhere alone, hungry or sick.<br/><br/>Chris makes some mistakes living alone which eventually kills him -- wasting his life, devastating his parents and causing a great deal of sorrow for his sister."

"RabidED990","7","15","30","8 June 2008"," F*ck Sean Penn
","Seriously, f*ck Sean Penn. For someone who 'respects' Chris McCandless as much as Penn claims that he does, he could have done a better and more honest job with the film he made about him.<br/><br/>First off, a number of events in the film are completely invented or embellished. Sure, we don't know *everything* McCandless did, but we know what he didn't do. And kayaking down the Grand Canyon, meeting nude Swedes on the banks of the Colordo, and figuring out that he was poisoned were not among them. Unless Sean Penn read a different version of ""Into the Wild"" than I did. He may very well have. He's Sean Penn, and great, after all. Or perhaps Sean Penn thought to himself ""Hey, I'm Sean Penn, I can tell a true story *better* than how it really happened!"" I'm thinking that was the case.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't even begin to touch base on a number of things extremely important to the audience's understanding of McCandless, both as a character and a human being. There wasn't even a mention of the philosophy he read, or of himself in his younger years, or anything. And, as a result, the *reason* for his actions isn't exactly developed or elaborated upon, and will likely be lost to the viewer if they are not familiar with McCandless beforehand.<br/><br/>His parent's side of the story isn't exactly represented fairly, either. Years of anguish and sadness and frustration are casually explained in a few throw-away scenes. Probably because they matter so much to Sean Penn.<br/><br/>And, from a purely film-making standpoint, I don't agree with many of the directorial decisions Penn made. The film has more montages than all the Rocky films combined, and more cheesy voice-overs than you can shake a stick at. From my perspective, both are too artificial. Tacky, almost. Neither go well with the minimalist and humanist nature of the story being told, and with McCandless' nature especially. And given the film's largely anti-commercial nature, it only makes sense that the score is done almost entirely by big name musicians like Eddie Vedder. Actually, wait, no it doesn't. Furthermore, Penn's camera placement is clichéd and textbook, and the impact of the scenes is never really all that it could be. Sure, we *see* McCandless' hardship and loneliness and frustration, but we don't *feel* it. At least I didn't."

","Well Mr. Penn certainly made a beautiful film, filled with great acting performances and I always appreciate good storytelling. I do find it a shame that this wonderfully told story is the most unmoving story I can remember in recent history. I love the notion of following one's dream no matter what the cost but I can't help but feel that this kid just needed to be loved and in not feeling so ran from his pain. That is not following a dream, that is running from disappointment that he was not strong enough to deal with after a childhood of being spoiled. I find it a real shame that so many people in our society live with similar disappointment that they are moved by a story that is so over-told it's tired."

","The main problem of this film is that it does not offer any glimpses into the psyche of the heroes. The frequent voice overs are superfluous and feel artificial. The end result feels like a long and uninteresting music video. It is difficult to imagine what a more capable director of movies that do not rely on dialogs would do with this matter (if they took up the story). Sean Penn should watch movies by Kieslowski to see how to communicate without words. Overall, there is not much to commend here. The camera work is sometimes beautiful but this is more the result of the stunning natural sceneries rather than inspired choices. The acting is unfortunately mediocre as well, even from the more famous cast members. If you decide to pass this title, you will not have missed anything."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","10","15","31","14 November 2007"," The best movie in a long, long time.
","I knew nothing of Christopher McCandless or the book of his life or even anything about this movie until I was sitting in the cinema. The only thing I knew is that Sean Penn was directing and having been very impressed with his gut-wrenching, if incredibly downbeat, The Pledge I was pretty much guaranteed to like this film. My guess turned out to be extremely correct.<br/><br/>Alexander Supertramp (that's Emile Hirsch as McCandless folks) is a man with no attachments. Having been raised in a loveless household by parents who only wish for him to 'or-din-ary' things he entertains them as far as graduating college but escapes to the country as soon as the diploma is in his hands.<br/><br/>His dream is to explore the land with no ID, no money and no chance of being found by those who might want to interfere with his mission of reaching peaceful seclusion in a remote corner of Alaska. Along the way he touches many lives, some brief, some profound and gains experience and character that some might never have even if they lived to a hundred.<br/><br/>Sean Penn's photography and affection for nature give this film an overall gorgeous look. It is surely one of the most uniquely composed films of the year. He reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood as an actor who can also direct fine movies and encourage impressive performances out of his cast. Pretty much everybody here is on top form, even Vince Vaughn manages to shake off the taint of those tawdry 'frat pack' comedies and play a genuine character for once.<br/><br/>But Hal Holbrook as old Ron Franz really is a standout. I've never seen a more heartfelt or touching performance in so long. If he doesn't earn an Academy Award come Oscar-time then there ain't no justice in the world. I think it's great that Sean Penn brought Holbrook (now 82) back for such an important and thought-provoking role. If you don't shed a tear for him then you have no soul.<br/><br/>Don't con yourself out of a good movie. It may have a limited release but Into the Wild is a film worth taking time out to see. Since I live in the UK, the story of Christopher McCandless (which appears to be some sort of true urban legend in America) is not well known here. I guess that having no expectations of the film made me enjoy it on the right level. Definitely something I will be tracking down on HD DVD when it's released.<br/><br/>PS<br/><br/>I broke my tooth while watching this movie.

The cast is very good, Penn obviously knows how to direct his actors,  the vistas are magnificent.  The problem for me is, the central character is someone who is smart  enough to know better, but goes ahead and does the stupid thing anyway.  I try to chalk it up to youth, but the scope of the lead character's  stupidity is so great, I find myself unable to do it. OK, I think.  Maybe when I was 21, I would have done something like that, given his  family life. But the answer always comes back, ""Hell, no. I wasn't even  that stupid at twelve.""   Christopher McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch ) has a mommy and daddy  (played by Marcia Gay Hardon & William Hurt) who fought a lot while he  was growing up. That's unfortunate. He graduates college and decides  most people lead empty lives. Hey, what a concept. And because he must  have a tremendous amount of rage towards mom and dad, he decides to  hell with it all, tears up his credit card and money or gives it away (  OK, that's kind of cool ) , and thinks, screw it! He's going on the  road! A free spirit! What is his ultimate goal? Alaska! Why? Who knows?  Maybe it's because that's as far away as he can get from mom and dad,  who despite the fact they fought like cats and dogs, are totally  anguished over the disappearance of their son. Who never, never tells  them where he went, or communicates with them once. He never even tells  his sister, the person he supposedly loves, what he intends to do. So  he's not just stupid, he's unforgiving. Yay.  So this over privileged, clueless 21 year old with a liking for Thoreau  & Byron (who probably wouldn't have been caught dead in Alaska, at  least, not THAT unprepared) sets off on his trek for a very cold place,  and on the way, behold, he encounters a bunch of colorful eccentrics,  whose lives he touches, briefly and magically, and then he flits away,  because he is, after all . .a free spirit. Evidently, someone has  neglected to tell Chris the 1960s are over, because he even gives  himself a wifty, 1960s name: Super Tramp.   Eventually, Chris gets to Alaska, and the guy who drops him off as far  into the wilderness as he'll dare to go says to him, ""I'll see you in  the spring, if you're still alive."" Does that faze Chris? No, because  someone kind of, SORT of told him how to smoke moose meat. The wonders  of nature await! Besides, all he has to do is cross that little creek.  Of course, during the spring melt, the thing becomes a raging river,  trapping him on the what turns out to be the wrong side of where he  should be. Oops.  He finds an abandoned bus to live in, and botches smoking his moose  meat, because maggots take over VERY quickly. Not to worry! He's got  his little ""Local Flora and Fauna"" book, so he can live off fruits and  roots and plants that aren't poisonous. Except he really sucks at using  the book and he DOES end up eating a highly toxic plant, and in his  starved condition, he doesn't last too much longer after that. He is so  sick at the end even a grizzly bear turns his nose up at him.  I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy? He was just as self indulgent  and selfish as the world he choose to reject, and being clueless,  nature culled him from the herd. End of story."

","Never read Jon Krakower's book, but nothing prepared this viewer for the intensity of the life it describes. The mere idea of a young man pursuing an ideal such as to be on his own, be self-reliant, follow his dreams, is something no one can easily comprehend. The fact that Chris McCandless, a young man with a bright future decides to leave it all and go search for a world unknown is to be celebrated because of the trappings of this society probably would have interfered in his quest. That he persevered, and even had to pay a dear price for following his dream is almost incomprehensible, given the kind of life and background where he came from.<br/><br/>Sean Penn, an uncompromising man in his life, as well as in his profession, shows a keen understanding to his subject's motives for going on his own to discover what was out there and spend his life doing exactly what he wanted. Mr. Penn has given us a work of love and beauty in his screen treatment of the life of a man that found fulfillment in doing exactly what he wanted.<br/><br/>Thus we follow the travels of Chris, who becomes Alexander Supertramp as he starts roaming the country. His goal is to get to Alaska, which to him probably his last frontier. Along the way he meets people that will touch his life, as well as his will touch theirs, no doubt. There are the hippie couple Rainey and Jan, free spirits that will get to meet him on a couple of occasions. Farmer Wayne and Alexander find they are much alike when they get to know one another. The most touching person the young man bonds with is Ron, the retired man who feels strongly about adopting him and leaving whatever he has to Alexander, who is not into material things.<br/><br/>One sad note is the way Chris rejects his parents. Perhaps he felt his rebellion against everything is because their own sad lives. Not even his own sister, Carine, is able to comprehend her brother's decision to leave them. The family never thought they would not see him again after he leaves home. There are so many unanswered questions in this story.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch, the talented young actor, was a magnificent choice for the main role. He gives his director, Sean Penn, a performance of epic proportions. Mr. Hirsch, one of our best screen performers injects life into the man he was asked to impersonate. Mr. Hirsch runs away with the film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone are seen as the parents, and sister of Chris McCandless. Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener are the hippie couple that befriend the young man. Vince Vaughn appears as Wayne. One of the most impressive actor in the film is without a doubt, Hal Holbrook, who outdoes himself as the kind Ron.<br/><br/>Sean Penn has established himself as an important voice in the American cinema. With ""Into the Wild"" he proves he has a great talent."

"aagodhand","1","12","24","26 June 2008"," Well done movie about a complete waste of life.
","WARNING: SPOILERS! Although I enjoyed some of the scenery, this movie was mostly a wast of time. It's a story of a self-important graduate from Emory University that goes on a journey of self-discovery. That would be okay, except his entire perspective on life is proved wrong at the end of the movie. He starts of by giving away all ""his"" college money, which would be impressive if it were actually his money (that he worked for) and not money his parents gave him. He then goes out West and hangs out with people and spouts off about society and how he's going to Alaska where he's going to live on his own, away from society. During this time his family is worried to death about him, and he doesn't bother to contact his sister (who he was apparently was close to), yet manages to write a letter to someone he just met after that someone goes to jail for selling pirated cable. He meets some burnout hippies and more self-important nonsense...until he gets to Alaska. MAJOR SPOILER: Once he's in Alaska the story could have been somewhat interesting except that not to long into his isolation experiment...HE DIES! Wow...I guess he really proved he doesn't need society, huh? <br/><br/>Every point the movie tried to make, about how free he is, about how society holds people down, about how money isn't necessary, is completely contradicted by the ending. He felt the need to give away all his parents money because ""money is evil"", yet worked on a farm when he ran out of money (he had kept $500 of his parents ""evil"" money) and couldn't wait to get his paycheck. He went off to live on his own because he doesn't need ""society"" bringing him down, yet shortly after leaving society he starved to death (after eating a poisonous plant). It seems he did nothing except get himself killed.<br/><br/>The story tries to make a thin excuse for Chris (the main character) and his behavior by showing how the parents fought all the time, but it really comes across as grasping as straws to explain narcissistic behavior.<br/><br/>I grew up in Atlanta, my father was a professor at Emory, and I went there. I've met dozens of self-important brats over the years (and been one of them at one time), people that reject society and its ways...until they need it. Had this guy just gone backpacking in Europe like most graduates he would have eventually returned, and inevitably become the yuppie he rebelled against like most college ""hippies"" do. But because he died, somehow he's a martyr. I guess in that sense he broke the cycle, but other than that he accomplished nothing. Oh, and just to add the final blow, I have to add how ironic it is when hippies drive around the country ""to be free"", all the while burning up gas and polluting the environment more than most people will in their lifetime.<br/><br/>Sean Penn does a great job directing, the actors are excellent, and the scenery is breathtaking. However, none of this is able to hide the fact that this is a movie about someone who wasted his life trying to prove something, and in the end proved the exact opposite. Yes, I know he was an actual person who really died, but I don't really care. I personally know lots of people who died (some of which also went to Emory) in much more tragic and meaningful ways."

","I like Penn and consider him talented. But for a much better treatment of idealistic and naïve man in unforgiving nature, I recommend Grizzly Man above Penn's flawed, and itself naïve ""Into the Wild.""<br/><br/>What Christopher McCandless did was place himself in an area where two kinds of humans manage to stay alive: a) those who bring plentiful food stores for their entire stay duration or transit duration of their presence there; or b) are people with hundred of generations and lifetimes of training and practice in getting barely substance levels of food from the land there.<br/><br/>What McCandless did is no different than people who think they can befriend all grizzly's or sharks, cross the Sahara or Kalahari with no water, or for that matter transcend gravity and jump from a plane with no chute.<br/><br/>Nature has no benign or malicious spirit, no intent, no spiritual element at all. It is beautiful in the grand and the small, and for the human animal either has sufficient calories or will kill you from starvation, just as the right large predators will kill you.<br/><br/>What on earth is Sean Penn thinking? To portray McCandless as something between Thoreau at Walden and Kerouac?No. Thoreau knew his soundings intimately, was a couple hours walk from several settlements. And Kerouac stuck to well traveled roads. McCandliss did not even bother with a map and put himself somewhere where there was no food.<br/><br/>Watch ""Grizzly Man,"" which is Werner Herzog's treatment about the same type of pathology, frankly the same type of suicide. Herzog is sensitive to his subject takes us to the edge of romanticizing the self destructiveness, but doesn't cross over.Penn absurdly romanticizes his subject and in fact for anyone who has read the books that stick to the facts, one can see Penn falsifies a lot of key facts as well."

","Do not let my 3/10 rating tell the story. It is not what it seems. After reading many positive reviews on the film, I was more than anxious to see it! So I did.<br/><br/>First, the film began somewhat slow, which, as any brilliant film director will agree, is absolutely essential for the development of both plot and characters. However, the pace of this film never evolved. There was no build. At times, in defense of the director, a drowsy feel seemed entirely necessary. I just think a little mix-up in the pacing would have helped this film immensely. Second, although the character developments were strong, especially on the part of the outstanding William Hurt, the plot was comparable to a weakly translated Odyssey. Homer would be disappointed. The numerous different ""players"" met throughout the story were well acted, but I could not empathize with their lives. Third, I found the main character to be far too rebellious . His character was completely one-sided, and I never got to see both sides of him. Truth, Independence, Alaska... Truth, Independence, Alaska... Truth, Independence, Alaska; We get it. We know what you want. Let's see what you plan to do about it. He was far too irritating as a person for me to get involved in his struggle for independence<br/><br/>Finally, my biggest problem with the film rested in the lack of climax. The ending of the film options were two-fold. Either he lives and becomes bettered from the experience, or he dies at the hand of the experience. The slow and predictable pattern of the film made me apathetic toward the ending, so there's no point in mentioning which route the film takes.<br/><br/>With all that said, let it be known that I felt something compelling me to finish the film, even though I could have shut it off. I am glad I did, but can guarantee I will not watch the film again.<br/><br/>Film Rating = D+ <br/><br/>Recommended = Yes, but only due to it's reputation - not my opinion."

The film is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man in search of true freedom. A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing! Some three hour plus films, don't feel anywhere near that long, that's how you know they're great.

Spouting famous philosophy and preaching ""deep"", recited understandings of the world in such a way that completely undermines the vast array of viewpoints and experiences of the many different people in the world end up looking so egotistical that it's nauseating to watch. <br/><br/>-Blaming one's problems on the crap that life brings is pathetically immature. You can't sympathize with a spoiled, rich kid who decides the world is a sham because his parents were not perfect. His sister, spouting her robotic reflections on Chris' life, reflects no emotion, no true reaction, just a passive acceptance that is completely unrealistic. <br/><br/>-It's hard to buy into the hippie, anti-materialistic celebrations in a movie that shows only the superficial, commercial-like beauty of both nature and people- for much of the movie, nature is friendly and nourishing, without acknowledgment of the dangers and harshness that are equally present. The characters met along the way often look like they are on their way to posing in a beer or shampoo commercial, rather than natural, human, real representations. Nude bodies in the real world are not so perfect as that. This kind of hypocrisy always makes me laugh in movies who try really hard to be deep and real, but only by following the standard Hollywood beauty formula. <br/><br/>-The main character is not likable. He is not someone who a person can connect with, understand, or relate to, despite his desires to escape, which we all feel from time to time. The fact that his immaturity and absolute arrogance are celebrated rather than explored ruins the film for me. <br/><br/>All in all, there is something in this film, but that something is utterly lost under the rubbish."

Because protagonist decides his parents are monsters and the cause of his so-very-hard life, he chucks his education and family away in favor of communing with nature in Alaska. With so many people having been raised by parents who molest them or beat the crap out of them or grow up in abject poverty or all of the above, I find that I have no sympathy for protagonist and his ""problems.""

"Superunknovvn","8","8","15","3 December 2007"," Sean Penn's breakthrough as a director
","With ""Into The Wild"" Sean Penn achieved something that only few actors from his mold have succeeded in: he proved himself a worthy director independent of his acting laurels. ""Into The Wild"" is just so good, that it blows the last bits and pieces of doubt away. Penn is not only directing this beautifully, he also managed to write a screenplay for a three hours movie about a guy who basically just wanders around in the wild and then starves, without ever slowing the movie down so much that it becomes boring. Sure, you have to be in the mood for this (and it's best to see it in a cinema, I guess), but if you really let yourself in for ""Into The Wild"", you'll be deeply touched by the story of this remarkable young guy who chose to live by his own rules and by his own rules alone.<br/><br/>There's not one weak link in the cast and Sean Penn directs all the actors to perfection. Emile Hirsch carries the movie. His resemblance to the real Christopher McCandless is uncanny as evidenced by a self portrait of McCandless at the end. What Hirsch did for the role - losing 40 pounds - is reminiscent of Christian Bale's engagement for ""The Machinist"" and speaks for the soul he put into his performance. All the supporting actors - in fact everybody other than Hirsch is a supporting actor here - are great as well: Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and the wonderful Hal Holbrook. Last but not least Eddie Vedder's soundtrack adds a lot to the haunting atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>""Into The Wild"" is something that won't let go of you after you've left the cinema and it might actually make you rethink your principles in life. I applaud Sean Penn for realizing his vision so well and hope to see more of him in the future. By him, actually."

"tabuno","6","3","4","21 January 2019"," Strong Movie With Major Flaws
","10 November 2007. Until the overly, emotionally wrought-movie's ending, INTO THE WILD held little in the way of redeeming value. Though gorgeous and visually stunning, Sean Penn is pretentious and overly excessive in his use of photographic and cinematic techniques. He unnecessarily tries to impress the audience with his apparent ability and knowledge of all the variety of camera work available to him. Unfortunately, the diversity and various uses of his art become a distraction in themselves and sometimes become story instead of the background. This jarring distraction becomes particularly apparent during the scene where Christopher McCandless visits a love tourist stop. In this scene Penn uses an almost documentary-style visual approach to the scene that is completely different from other styles he used in the other portions of the movie. It's use appears to more for showing off than really contributing to the story of the movie. The frequent scattering and non-linear, flashbacks, flashforwards isn't always a pleasant trip, making the audience having to twist and turn in ways that really detract from the main themes of the movie. Instead of allowing the audience just to immerse themselves into the story, they are forced into a roller-coaster ride of almost dream-like snatches of experience that never truly gel into a satisfying experience. Never is the audience allowed to truly grasp the depth of the McCandless' parent's transformation, from their beginning to their ending. Vince Vaughn, probably, has the most authentic, and delightful role in the movie, where his acting is on full display that eschews any of Vaughn's typical character stereotype. The fascinating threads that Sean does present are interesting with their continual focus on relationships throughout the movie that McCandless is exposed to. But unfortunately, these threads never truly succeed in revealing McCandless' depth of relational experience. For example, there are lukewarm inferences of emotional tragedy or regard with respect to McCandless but in another scene from another movie demonstrates how much is lacking in Penn's presentation of McCandless as a character's own emotional trial and self-absorption. In Dr. Zhivago (a book that McCandless actually reads in the movie) the audience is allowed to linger in a haunting scene of Dr. Zhivago's love leaving his life forever in a sleigh that becomes smaller and smaller until it's just a dot on the horizon before fading completely away as Dr. Zhivago desperately tries to climb up into the house's top window and look out at the last glimmer of his love life. The jet airplumes in INTO THE WILD, are much more effectively used in 24 Days After, a movie where a biological contaminated Britain is wiped out and it is only the airplumes overhead that suggest (not as in INTO THE WILD of civilization to runaway from) but civilization that saves. There is the moose killing that is so disrespectful of nature and the land. There is the reckless disregard for taking responsibility of freedom, taking advantage to not conform to the rules of society. Most of the movie appears to be an over-glorification of the wild, rugged, individual man seeking his own identity and freedom, yet, it avoids the more harsh realities that McCandless also likely experienced along the way, except for the very ending. Six out of Ten Stars. Revised 2/14/08."
"tigerman2001","Null","3","4","18 March 2010"," (1) Brilliant film (2) the protagonist and his story is simultaneously inspiring and idiotic
","Sean Penn and crew did an excellent job here. Cinematography and editing are great and real locations are used to full potential. Emile Hirsch is phenomenal and Hal Holbrook also really stands out. Special mention of Brian Dierker, acting for the first and (so far) only time, as Rainey: a feat even if he IS basically that character, because getting in front of a camera instantly turns most of us into anything but who we naturally are. His chemistry with Catherine Keener is stellar and the two are part of the film's heart and soul.<br/><br/>Supertramp's journey is compelling in many ways, whether followed by book or by film. But there's much polarization regarding whether Alex/Chris was a visionary prophet of the road (or, at the very least, a free spirit on a Thoreau kick) or an utterly self-indulgent moron. I'm one who emphatically sees him as BOTH, and then some.<br/><br/>I grew up in settings that allowed me access to a lot of outdoor experience, including formative years living at an outdoor-pursuits center where my parents worked. Thus I had easy entrée to outdoor activity and the tools with which to hone skills necessary to survival in the wild, to deal with things when it all goes wrong (as it surely will) without freaking out excessively and letting panic doom me or anyone else. I also saw for myself that Nature is wonderful and Gaia-licious but that she really doesn't care if we live or die; I see the natural world with both a 'romanticized' and a very pragmatic, survival-based eye, both being part of the truth.<br/><br/>My whole life's involved study of Nature, including years of field research experience (PhD in ecology) diving on coral reefs in far-flung places on the edge of the blue horizon. Did I have near misses with my own mortality during that time? Sure did. Was I 'adventurous'? Well, yeah, in terms of having what might be called 'adventures' in exotic places around dangerous animals (I studied one for my doctorate). I have also more than once hit the road and vagabonded, the longest such bout being at age 20 back in the '80s. So, yeah, I can relate very strongly to Chris' drive, and to what he felt out there on the edge, where you never know from day to day where you'll be at nightfall and, indeed, even if you'll be alive. It's simultaneously exhilarating and scary.<br/><br/>The BIG difference between someone like me and someone like McCandless, though, is that he went flat-out against the wall at every turn, rashly leaping into things way above his head. You can only get away with that kind of thing so long. If I 'have an adventure' I know my capabilities and where they start to fade. It's risk management. Some of what such people do may look bold and brave but you can't tell, from looking, what they're REALLY doing: if they're well trained and aware of the risks and their environment they may actually be playing it quite cautiously within bounds of experience and ability. Film stunt players are good examples, too: what looks totally out of control is actually carefully planned (well, ideally) and rehearsed by specialists. Pushing boundaries is fine but in doing so you want to control the risk you know is there; you may still mess up, but at least the fall may be survivable.<br/><br/>Sometimes you have the adventure and sometimes the adventure has you. The idea is to minimize that last possibility. You must know what you KNOW and know what you DON'T know. Young Chris was woefully unprepared for many of his adventures, pushing boundaries without knowing what they really WERE, careening off boundary after boundary. It's amazing he made it as far as he did. On one level I salute him for that, and admire his zeal and passion, but on another I recognize him as irresponsible and self-centered. He was a sensitive, intelligent, self-indulgent young man with a mind full of pithy quotes and concepts from Literature who failed to see past the most superficial of those lessons and parables. He was an idealist, and I can appreciate that, but he forgot that we all have to get by in the real world and that cost him everything.<br/><br/>Is he the sage hero some proclaim? Well, if his story inspires you, go emulate his ideal but PLEASE first learn a thing or two about what your journey might require. I'm disconcerted to find a whole Internet subculture that basically worships Chris and his folly. Idiots. Chris' death was unnecessary and stupid, but a likely outcome. He basically failed to remain humble in the face of Nature. Whether clueless or arrogant, that sort of thing doesn't make for happy endings. His should be a cautionary tale in this aspect, not an inspirational one.<br/><br/>Regardless, as a film this succeeds on every level; a masterpiece. If it was mythology it'd be just as powerful. Sean Penn comes uncomfortably close at times to painting Chris as Jesus-like, the Magic Hobo, but he does at least acknowledge the cruel effect of Chris deserting his parents (and his sister) and the final realization that his journey's epiphany was, thanks to the Nature in which he sought to immerse himself, impossible to realize. The film also shows that, for all Chris' vaunted self-sufficiency, throughout his travels he relied on help from others, many portrayed as surrogate parental figures: the clues to his final realization were there all along, every step of the way. When he finally found what he wanted it did him no good because he could not go back again. Forget all the back and forth over whether Supertramp was a wise wanderer or a self-indulgent little jerk, really, because this consideration is a timeless thought, and this film manages to convey a few of those.<br/><br/>Excellent job, all involved. Rest in peace, Christopher Johnson McCandless."

","In 1992, 24-year old Chris McCadless set off into the wilds of Alaksa where he died of starvation. Some press coverage presented him as a foolish young adventurer; but in his thoughtful book, 'Into the Wild', author John Krakauer showed how McCandless mostly knew what he was doing, and was perhaps unlucky to perish. Moreover, interpolating from McCandless's life and his own feelings as a young man, Krakauer inferred that Chris was engaged in a serious quest to find a meaningful way of living, a quest not completely invalidated by the fact that it ended in a particularly nasty death. Sean Penn's film of the book captures some of this, but it's a long movie (given that most viewers probably know the ending before it starts), and Penn makes choices that don't exactly betray the spirit of the book but which do simplify it, emphasising McCandless's family problems, making his experiences seem almost ecstatic, and replacing Krakauer's narration with a sister to whom he gives an almost gnomic sense of wisdom. I would also have been tempted to cast a less attractive actor in the leading role, and in other roles too: the weight of the story is undermined slightly by the prevalence of Hollywood looks. It's still an interesting as well as a tragic story; but I think the book told it better."

","It's too bad that I saw Werner Herzog's amazing documentary ""Grizzly Man"" before I saw ""Into the Wild."" One can't help but be reminded of Herzog's film while watching Penn's, or the fact that Herzog's is so much better.<br/><br/>Both films have as their focus troubled young men who travel to the Alaskan wilderness to escape a society in which they feel they don't belong. Both men have persecution complexes of a sort, and feel that there's something noble in their efforts to commune with the wilderness. But ""Grizzly Man"" is an objective, journalistic account of Timothy Treadwell, and Herzog's fascination is with the obsessions that made him tick. ""Into the Wild,"" being a fictional film, is already once-removed from the real-life story of Christopher McCandless, and director Penn piles on so much bombast and padding, that the impact of the story becomes blunted under a veneer of pure Hollywood studio.<br/><br/>My biggest obstacle in liking this film is that I didn't like the character of Christopher, nor did I like Emile Hirsch, the actor who plays him. McCandless, who gives himself the moniker Alexander Supertramp once he's set off on his odyssey, is an arrogant 20-year old who thinks he has the world figured out, and woe be to anyone who tries to tell him otherwise. His psychological troubles stem from the emotionally (and the movie suggests at times physically) abusive environment he grew up in. His parents are played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as cartoonish caricatures of Southern aristocracy; his sister, played by Jena Malone, is the only one who Christopher believes understands him, and her character provides the film with one of the most thudding voice over narrations I've ever heard in a movie. We get it -- he shuns the materialistic world as a way of shunning his affluent parents. But a two and a half hour movie built around a kid learning a lesson that many of us already knew going into it makes for a mighty tedious movie indeed.<br/><br/>That lesson, learned too late, is that human companionship makes life worth living, and that happiness means very little if you have no one to share it with. Many recognizable actors show up throughout the film as strangers Christopher comes across and develops fleeting relationships with, and all of them have a chance to pontificate. The trouble is that all of them (especially Catherine Keener as a hippie and Hal Holbrook as a lonely old man) are so much more interesting than Christopher himself that we wish the movie would stay with them and let Christoper be on his merry way.<br/><br/>This movie really copped out as far as I'm concerned. Everyone Christopher comes across is gently understanding of his plan even if they try to discourage him. Not once does someone tell him that his actions represent supreme cowardice and hypocrisy. If he was so bothered by the state of society, why didn't he do something productive to help change it rather than run away and hide? Maybe this is the point Penn was trying to make, but I felt like Penn himself couldn't decide whether Christopher's behavior was foolish or admirable.<br/><br/>I feel like I was meant to come away from this film moved by the tragedy of a life wasted. But I wasn't moved at all, nor did I find it all that tragic. ""Grizzly Man"" -- now THERE's a film that moved me.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"framesasecond","6","10","21","2 November 2007"," Unfulfilled promise
","I was disappointed by Penn's film adaptation of Into the Wild. On the positive side, I found Catherine Keener's performance as Jan Burres completely convincing. I enjoyed the Vedder soundtrack, and I thought certain cinematic elements were beautiful (though not always serving to the storyline) such as the night shots in L.A. However, there was a lot a didn't care for. The voice over narration by Carine McCandless (Jena Malone) didn't work for me because the story was not hers to tell, and the narration together with the rapid cutting within scenes and the frequent temporal shifts left me unable to identify with either Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) or the viewpoints of the characters that Chris met along his way as I was able to do with, for example, the supporting characters in Agnès Varda's Vagabond (1985). Being unable to identify with any of the characters, I was left in the position of an outside observer and here Penn failed to make much of this position either. For example, Penn did not use the camera to show us anything that Chris failed to figure out. Krakauer's book makes clearer that the magic bus was not as isolated as Chris believed it to be, and that the seasonal river that cut off Chris's planned departure route could have been crossed upstream. Penn could have unobtrusively shared this information with the viewer, but chose to withhold it for the purpose, I suspect, of romanticizing Chris's adventure."

","This is my favorite movie. When is saw this movie for the first time,i was totally shocked that somebody left his family without knowing where he is.
I like the music so much i bought it on cd.<br/><br/>June 21 2015 i left the Netherlands and went to America to do the trip that Alexander (Alex) Supertramp did. I visited the locations and ended of course in Alaska. During my trip in Alaska i met a girl named Sarah that looked very much like Tracy Tatro in the movie. She played guitar and could sing like Tracy. We visit together the location of the movie bus and we went to the nature three days walking from the real bus that still is in the nature. She left back to Anchorage to go back to San Francisco where she lives. I walked three days to the real bus that is stil standing in the nature. When i was at the location of the bus i slept in a tent for three days close to the bus. After that i walked more in to the nature to be alone for a week. It is strange to be alone for a week,i even started talking to myself. After my trip in the nature i lifted back with people to Anchorage. I had the greatest time there.<br/><br/>When i left Alaska i went back to San Francisco to see Sarah. We started a relationship in the last three weeks that i was in America. In August 2016 i stopped working in The Netherlands and said goodbye to family and friends,because i was going to live in San Francisco with Sarah. August 21 2016 i left The Netherlands and went to Sarah. After three days Sarah told me that she lost her job and went back to her mother to live there. I stayed in a hotel close to her mothers house but after a while we realized the relationship was over.<br/><br/>From that moment i thought what really makes me happy? The only thing that came up in my head is traveling around the world. I went from San Francisco to Las Vegas,Canada,Mexico,England,Ireland,And much more countries. I travel now for almost three years without seeing my family and old friends. Some people call me selfish for leaving my family and friends. I still have contact with family and some friends using e-mail.<br/><br/>Traveling makes me happy now for almost three years. Christopher Mccandless quote is:Happiness is only real when shared.

OK - I get it, he had terrible parents. Lots of people do, but you don't see them taking off without warning and putting the people who love and care about them through hell. I also get that convening with nature and isolating oneself from the modern world is attractive to some people. But why oh why would you be so incredibly stupid as to take off without letting someone know? I love how he had the realization at the end of the movie that he would only attain true happiness if he had someone to share it with. Blech. Nature abhors a vacuum, and at the end of the film when the Universe treats him with a dose of his own medicine. When he died I found myself really caring less about him and more about his poor family who had to deal with the news that, had he not been selfish, and told someone where he was he might still be alive.<br/><br/>Plus I hated the narration from his sister who kept trying to make excuses for his behaviour - Honey - stop trying to peg his pitiful excuse for not being a decent human being on his ""journey to find himself"".

"princesss_buttercup3","5","6","11","19 June 2008"," He's not a martyr, he just has a sad story.
","Here's the thing about this film, and I suppose the book, had I read it. Let me say firstly that I have a lot of respect for both Sean Penn and Jon Krakauer, and the performance of Emile Hirsch was outstanding. That being said, this film was beyond disappointing. The ""moral"" lends itself to great misunderstanding, and I think the movie runs the danger of creating a martyr out of a man who, while eccentric and interesting, is anything but a hero. I might have liked it if I was not already well acquainted with another well-known true story of man against the elements and the profound search for meaning in human existence. I found myself contrasting Christopher McCandless' journey to that of Nando Parrado, one of the sixteen survivors of the Uruguayan rugby team plane crash in the Andes in 1972. Parrado (who also happens to be a friend) chronicled his experiences in a 2006 memoir called ""Miracle in the Andes,"" and I can't help but wonder how McCandless' road might have taken a different turn had he heard Parrado's story first. Of course, there were several differences between the two men's stories, but the most profound are these: while McCandless' isolation and solitude (including from his family and friends) was intentional, Parrado found himself in his circumstances because of dumb luck. What makes this ironic is that while both men ultimately discovered that the only antidote to death is love, McCandless' suffering (as well as the suffering he inflicted on his family) was completely pointless. The second major difference between the stories is that while McCandless succumbed to ""fate"" when, as it turns out, he could very likely have survived, Parrado- whose death was a virtual certainty- refused to give in. Parrado even wrote in his book that although he was sure he was dead when he began his trek over the Andes (which lasted 11 days and took him over 17k foot peaks in nothing but street clothes and after starving on the mountain for 60 days), he *chose* to keep breathing in and out, so that when he did finally drop, he would die ""one step closer to his father."" McCandless, on the other hand, ran from his father only to find out (too late) that his great adventure was simply an illusion. This didn't sit well with me. I sympathize with McCandless' need to let go of his dependency on the comforts and conveniences of life and to remove himself from the familiar in order to force a deep look within. But with all due respect to his family, I don't find any nobleness in McCandless' story. It is simply a tragedy. And a needless one at that. I hope it is that lesson-- and not some beautiful and tragic glory that Krakauer and Penn try (and in my opinion, fail) to wrestle from this story-- that people ultimately remember."
"timothyhogg","3","6","11","17 February 2008"," Another failed attempt at McCandless
","Finally, after months of resistance, I have decided to watch Into The Wild. Please see my previous comments about my thoughts on the film before proceeding with this review of the film itself. Now, let me start by saying that already, just 20 or so minutes into this film, I have already come to the conclusion that the character of McCandless was not cast very closely to the person I see as McCandless when I think of this film. Emilie Hirsh is too young and too well groomed to be playing that part of McCandless, who most certainly had an air of hippiness to him in the book. Hirsch is not able to carry that as well because he doesn't look like he has been living the life of the vagabond at all. Penn does a good job or casting his parents and sister, who certainly have covered the wealthy parent's part quite exceptionally. These are the types of parents that almost anyone I know would certainly cause resistance. This perfect casting of the parents only makes Hirsch's character seem more off base. The film yearns to make a bigger deal out of the ever so tragic upbringing of McCandless than the book. According to the film, the love story of his parents was all a lie and his father was actually married to another woman when he and Chris' mother met. There was even another son following the birth of Chris by his former wife, all which leads to inevitable conclusion that this is what led this guy into this journey into the Alaskan bush. I suppose that is the central issue that I have always had with this story. In the book, Kraukuer used the McCandless story to chronicle his own personal story of man vs nature (of course he survives). The film makes the same mistake in attempting to insert a sub-narrative of the film, which is McCandless vs himself and his upbringing. We don't need to have this possibility spoon fed to us, but the film goes out of its way to explain that McCandless was a silver spoon with problems and these problems are what drives him on this pathway to discovery. This simply does not work for me. From my experience, man v nature occurs not so much because of our past, but more so because we resist what we might become if we do not take a moment of our lives and attempt to answer the questions of our own existence. I find now that I am older and past that confusing point in my life that it is essential to get off the grid for awhile and see what life is about other than what is programmed for us to do. In order to begin to understand consumption, you have to starve first. Too many people I know today have never really taken this journey. Instead, they look to sport of celebrity to fulfill that need we all have to be individuals or within a group. The story that Penn has crafted is a good one, if it weren't supposed to be based on someone else's life. The sad part of the movie is that this was someone's life and I think he would be morbidly offended at how he was presented in this film. At times this film is so simple it almost works, but then there are other moments where it so Hollywood that its reminiscent of a Calvin Klein commercial. Another thing that demands to be mentioned is McCandless' lack of communication to his family, specifically his sister, who seemed to not deserve this intentional disappearance. This coupled with the fact that he died about three miles from the main road, leads me to think about my original thoughts on the book: What makes this story worthy of such massive consumption? What is the moral of this story? McCandless always come off the same way, as a kid who was always given everything, which he rejected. Then, as he falls off the grid, he ends up dying from his own mistakes. Perhaps that is why this story is so consumable, because the person that lived it is not there to tell the story from his perspective. However, Penn's issues with telling the story are multiple. The flashbacks to a better time take away from the loneliness that McCandless must have felt from a couple of simple mistakes takes away from the moment that we should have to truly get close to the character. Factual errors when telling the life story of someone is simply unacceptable. Penn does this several times in order to keep consistency with the film. The last fifteen minutes of the film are boarder line farcical in their interpretation of the end. The way that Penn sets up the story, using flashbacks instead of real time, doesn't allow the viewer as close to the character as we should be with such an emotional plight. It would make more sense to tell the story in a chronological order, without all of the kitsch and more of the change as it happens in McCandless. It seems that the audience is supposed to automatically have feeling for this character, which I have a difficult time doing. . The repeated guitar riff from the introduction gets to be overbearing by the end of the film<br/><br/>In the end the sister says, ""In the end it was Chris' story and it was Chris that had to be telling it."" Unfortunately, we have to rely on the intervention of two very different variations of the reality, both of which fall very short In the end, McCandless imagines running into the arms of his parents, which I can only imagine was the last thing on his mind as he perished from his own miscalculations, in the wild.

","I went into this film with a certain amount of caution and it seems to have been justified. There are two reasons people seem to either love or hate this film, firstly the character's 'adventure' and ideals, and secondly the cinematography.<br/><br/>I don't think its fair to criticize the film over the ideals of Chris, it is there to tell his story. What I do have a problem with is how tediously Penn tries to make this point. The sister's narration, the letters to Wayne, the 'chapter' titles, they were all so painfully labored, as if there was some need to give us everything we needed to get from the film. This for me was the greatest weakness of the film; it lacked any subtlety in comparison to say Kelly Reichardt's Old Joy. What Penn seemed to aim for, and which Reichardt could achieve, seems lost in his inability to let things speak for themselves.<br/><br/>On the second point I do think the cinematography was beautiful, but I don't think it was used particularly well. There were a number of visual styles imposed across the film and for no apparent reason. There were also random shots, planes flying overhead, a lorry passing over the camera at a Batman villain-esquire angle, that did not sit well in the overall picture. It seemed to me that Penn was pulling off an amateurish attempt to make his film seem meaningful by overloading it with shallow symbols and as many visual styles he could get his hands on.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I thought the film had some real potential, but I'm not sure how much of this came from Penn. Any of the parts where Chris interacts with others were captivating and the relationships that were developed were beautiful. The story could easily have locked onto these with much greater enthusiasm and ignored the self-indulgent attempt at being 'art-house'.<br/><br/>Two films spring to mind as useful comparisons to how awful this film was, The Straight Story and Old Joy. Watch either of these and Into the Wild pales in comparison."

","(My Synopsis) Based on the true story of 22 year-old Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp, gives his entire savings to charity after he graduates with honors from Emory, and begins his journey and great adventure into the wild. Chris believes that he can life off the land and that he doesn't need any money to do that. He had a goal of testing himself to the fullest by heading into the wilds of Alaska and surviving alone. It took Chris about two years to finally make it to Alaska, and along the way he meets a series of colorful people that he had never before encountered through his privileged life. His quest to learn more about the American culture took him from the wheat harvest in South Dakota to a kayak trip down the Colorado River into Mexico, and Slab City, California, before he finally makes it to Alaska. Once in Alaska, Chris must battle for his life against the harsh reality of nature in an abandoned bus.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This isn't a happy movie, but it is an emotionally wrenching and thought provoking story that will make you think. It is about our society, family, idealism, and nature; most of all it is about the romanticism of youth and the tragic consequences of an unforgiving and dangerous wilderness. Chris left everything behind to find something pure in the world, or the meaning of life, or just himself by pushing the limits into the wilderness. During his two wandering years, Chris learns from every person he meets and adds something to his overall experience and the tools he will need to survive. The only problem with that is Chris went into the wilderness without ample preparation. Too little knowledge and experience will get you killed, especially, in Alaska. Considering Chris' intelligence and resources he had with him, it seems that he was very foolish, naive, and youthfully stupid.<br/><br/>While Chris was in the ""magic bus"" the movie takes us back and forth in time and explains his dysfunctional family life and his earlier travels during his last two-years. I would have preferred the movie be shown in chronological order and not with so many flashbacks. Emile Hirsch gives an absorbing, completely believable performance as Chris. Hirsch deserves a lot of credit, because he sacrificed and gave of himself to the role. Hirsch lost a lot of weight during the movie to show that Chris was starving to death, and Hirsch will probably receive an Oscar for his performance. It is a long movie, so get ready for it before it starts, because you can't leave your seat until the very end. The story has a tragic ending, but it was beautiful and profound at the same time. At the end of the movie, they show a picture of Chris that was taken by him in front of the bus, and we see that Hirsch resembles him, which is uncanny.

The character development did not help me to sympathize with the main character, he came off as a brash, uninformed idealist with no real intelligence. The interspersing of random trippy imagery and psychedelic image collages flashing occasionally throughout the movie just confused and irritated me. The manner in which the main character makes his ""adventure"" is both naive and offensive. I like to think I know quite a bit about wilderness survival, it is clear that this guy didn't. He starved to death in the middle of Alaska in springtime. GIVE ME A BREAK. This is what happens when you know nothing and try to do something anyways. You don't just go eating berries willy nilly because you are hungry, you carefully conduct taste tests to make sure it won't KILL YOU. I just cannot say enough against this movie.

His interactions with Rainey and Jan (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener) were some of the most touching scenes that warmed me from the cold scenes showing what Chris endured while he was alone up in Alaska.

During the adventure he relates to many people that help guide him to his long journey to Alaska where he will live alone Into the Wild.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the fact that I can relate to Chris's character myself where I feel like I can't live like everyone else with the 9 to 5 lifestyle. The pressure of everyday beats down on you where you just want to leave everything but don't have the courage to do so. I consider Chris McCandless a hero and perhaps one day I can break out of this shell and be free just as he does in the film.<br/><br/>Eddie Vedder's soundtrack was perfect for the film. I'll admit that Pearl Jam is my favorite band (I wish I could see Rats live), but it doesn't mean that Vedder could screw up a film. In this case, he was completely on. The song society is my personal favorite. The lyrics are right on to the film's message.<br/><br/>All the supporting performances were great.

And if it matters, it isn't fair to any lost, broken soul like this poor dumb kid to turn his pain into something glorious because we are afraid ourselves.<br/><br/>Regular readers of mine know that I get frustrated when there exists a fine reading experience, and then it is made into a book and people think somehow that if the events are conveyed that is sufficient. Its because reading is a sacred thing. Cinema, when handled well, is too. And so is that special state where the mind is attuned to whatever elements of nature you see. Its that attunement, that process, that ""shifting into"" that matters.<br/><br/>Penn understands this. He's a serious artist. He knows that this is a film not a story. And it is about the word, the written word, not some likable runaway. It starts well, and with this notion, us seeing the words from his journal in the foreground, the images mere annotation. One of the hardest things to do in film is to start. You have only a few moments to create a world.<br/><br/>Throughout, we have a constant battle, a battle of words with images. The images nearly win, or so it seems. The end has our hero escaping the words of the idealistic books he carts around to see, actually see something transcendent. We are supposed to go along.<br/><br/>But here is where the words govern, they shape and control. The first level of course is that this is a movie made from a book. It is a book written by a man whose job is to weave the notion that ascetic communing with nature is the purest of pursuits. Its got enough truth and tradition near it to allow it to create a powerful fiction. This boy's life wasn't important or interesting. What made him the target of Krakauer's book, was because he was a writer, and left documents.<br/><br/>Its like the great Antarctic Scott expedition who perished for much the same reason, and were celebrated for precisely the same reason: they left compelling journals until they died. So we have Krakauer's words, fabulated and extending the boy's words. And these are based not on any internal vision, but on the words of others who he not only read, he carried books into the wild instead of food.<br/><br/>So three layers of words, each one stepping closer to an idealism of nature while using notions and media further removed.<br/><br/>The final irony of course is that he dies because he misread a word in a reference book on edible plants (as it happens in the film).<br/><br/>Words matter in this film. They control the story as they run into the wild and incidentally carry this guy and the others he encounters, all obviously written not born. Penn could be a really important filmmaker, and here he comes really close to making a film about the compromises of film. <br/><br/>Penn has only a few times where he crosses the line for me. They all have to do with the segments concerning the parents. One is particularly egregious. We are told that his dad was a smart enough man to be hired to engineer communications for NASA satellites. When we are told this, we see a NASA-supplied clip of a rocket being launched. That clip and its cousins have been seen countless times and is semiotically loaded. Its a shorthand for ""high tech"" whatever that means. Its a problem for two reasons.<br/><br/>One is the simple rule of overshowing. The cinematic effects here depend on the visions coming from the outside, slowly permeating that shell of consciousness. Penn does fairly well on this, avoiding the Carroll Ballard effect of human-manufactured natural ideals. But it depends on consistency, and he breaks it here. It takes a good 20 minutes to recover.<br/><br/>But the other problem: the irony is that satellite communications isn't about rockets and power. Its about isolation, desolate vacuums, sterile modes, the inability to touch. It also happens to be cinematically accessible through some other stock footage, and when appropriate, folded into the images of winter and bus... and writing.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsh is very good. He's been now in three expertly edited films, and I mean truly cutting edge.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"James_nicholson98","10","4","7","28 December 2018"," A Perfect Movie
","Literally a perfect movie. The storyline was good. Acting was good. The ending!
Everything was just perfect. I didn't find any fault within this movie.
Many people have mentioned in the reviews that the movie was better than the book. I don't know that for sure because I haven't read the book.<br/><br/>The story is about a young boy, who has just got graduated as a top student decides to leave everything behind and live his life the way he wants.
Literally he leaves all his possessions, his family, everything, he leaves his entire society in which he grew up.
In some way he was selfish to do that, to leave his family without a single note or a letter, to have his parents, his sister worrying over him for years.
But on the other hand leaving with no traces left behind was the only way he could get what he wanted, only way he could get complete freedom, and live his life the way he wanted.<br/><br/>The annoying, wearisome behavior of his parents was one of the major reasons that caused him to take this decision. He was worn out, tired of this whole civilization thing, the society. So he decided to leave everything behind, his possessions, money, and even his identity. He donated all his money he had for his future education to charity.
On his way of leaving the society behind, on his way into the wild, he meets new people, and he learns new things from them. And he gets to spend the life he wanted away from the materialistic society.<br/><br/>The story is about his journey. It's an awesome story. Very enjoyable. And so were the performances. Brilliant. All of the actors were very suited for their roles. The directing was also very good.
And this movie also teaches a very important lesson, to learn that you need to watch the movie.
This movie is not just another movie about survival it's more than that. It teaches you the greatest lessons about life.
It is one of the very few movies that can have a a very big impact on you, that it leaves you a lot of things to think about, to argue about, after watching the movie.
I think It's a must watch for anyone."
"Samiam3","9","4","7","31 July 2010"," An epic American adventure
","Of all the animals shown in this movie: The Kodiak Bear, the Grey Wolf, the Bald Eagle, the Moose etc, only one has the ability to make dreams.... that animal is man. <br/><br/>From director Sean Penn, Into the Wild captures in detail one of the defining features of the human species; to be able to have a dream, and the desire to fulfill it. Despite a somewhat clunky two and a half hour running length (which may feel loger depending on how old you are) Into the Wild is an adventure that becomes one with the viewer. It is a demanding project but the work has paid off nicely, and I'll raise my glass to it for that.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless. After graduating college as an A+ student in 1992, he chose to leave his materialist society and stuck up family behind. He chaged his name to Alex Supertramp, and embarked on a quest for Alaska. On his journey, he covered thousands of miles of American wilderness, on foot, by train, car, kayak, meeting a plethora of weird and wonderful people along the way.<br/><br/>It is absolutely vital for the movie that the character of Chris/Alex is one whose company we can enjoy. After all, his journey is ours. Emile Hirsh's performance is definitely sufficient. He is a little wacky but in a good way. He is also talented, bold, determined, and fun to be around. I suppose it is also worth noting that he has a pretty face.<br/><br/>A movie like Into the Wild is also demanding on the crew. After all, the storyline covers about half the country, which of course means lots of transportation is needed, and lots of landscape imagery. The camera is all over the place, referring of course to locations (not movement). Into the Wild is a gorgeously photographed picture, which is backed up with a great song score from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. I remember a couple years ago during Oscar season being annoyed that his songs were snubbed, because of eligibility rules.<br/><br/>My one problem with the movie, is that the editing feels a bit tripy. Into the Wild frequently plays with time in a Pulp Fiction manner, and some of that time concerns flashbacks related to family melodrama. These scenes are conveniently short but they don't seem important enough to be worth showing. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that the last half hour could use a few trims.<br/><br/>No movie is perfect of course, and no human being is perfect either, it is not until the end of the film when we realize that about Chris. But I'll say this much, the journey was worth it, and if you can spare an hour and a half for Into the Wild, I think you will agree with me on that."
"imagiking","8","4","7","17 March 2010"," Into the Wild: Uncompromisingly Brilliant
","Into the Wild is Sean Penn's adaptation of the same-titled novel by John Krakaeur. Filmed, among other places, in the wilds of Alaska where a good deal of the real story it tells occurred, it is a faithful presentation of an interesting tale.<br/><br/>The film is the story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who becomes disillusioned with the world of upper class life, and goes off into the wild to find something more meaningful in his existence. Meeting many interesting characters along the way and affecting their own views on life, McCandless aims forever toward Alaska, the final point of his lengthy journey.<br/><br/>I found myself instantly drawn into this film. The primary element in this effect is the soundtrack. Eddie Vedder creates a beautiful score which chronicles this adventure and compliments the sprawling beauty of the unoccupied landscapes. The visuals of the film are incredible, the natural shots of this better, effulgent world spellbinding. Penn beautifully directs some of the most stunning images that can be captured. Undoubtedly, the film owes all to the main performance. Emile Hirsch creates a character so real, emotional and three dimensional that we cannot help but be pulled into his vision of the world. The voiceovers from Chris and his sister give us a deeper insight into his motivations as the film flickers between our hero in his perfect world, travelling to get there, and experiencing his personal hell at home. All comes together to create a stunning experience which left me breathless and amazed at its power. The strength of the film is impressive, staggeringly poignant and uncompromisingly brilliant. Especially touching, for me at least, was the performance of Hal Holbrook, a genuinely upsetting and tear-jerking addition.<br/><br/>With some of the best acting one can ever hope to experience in film, the natural beauty of the Alaskan wilderness forms a backdrop for the genius of this film. Straying from outrightly stating the moral correctness of its protagonist, Into the Wild poises questions which continued to haunt me for weeks and weeks after seeing it. Add a wonderful score, a deeply meaningful story, and a director who obviously believes incredibly in his work, and you have one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching."
"dunmore_ego","8","4","7","6 March 2009"," Northern Over-Exposure.
","The question will always be: Once you get INTO THE WILD, what do you do there? Of all the people to ask this pertinent, profound question of Chris McCandless - it is Vince Vaughn.<br/><br/>From a book by Jon Krakauer (who also wrote Into Thin Air), Sean Penn directs Emile Hirsch as Christopher Johnson McCandless (Feb 1968 - Aug 1992), who shucked off his earthly possessions, did a Henry David Thoreau and flitted into the wilds of Alaska to live off the land. Vaughn plays a farmer employer that Chris (Hirsch) meets along the way.<br/><br/>After graduating as an 'A' student from Emory University, Chris stuns his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and surprises his sister by giving all his money to charity, burning his Social Security card - his strongest link to an identity in the ""civilized"" world - and setting out on foot with nothing but a backpack and seeming enochlophobia (fear of crowds).<br/><br/>He renames himself Alexander Supertramp and travels from Arizona, kayaking illegally down to Mexico, then trudging/hitching up to Alaska. Along the way, he meets a cast of characters who each tells Chris, or at least fears, that his quest to isolate himself will end in tragedy, and unwittingly offer him three staples of ""civilization"": Vaughn offers money - the steady job; a hippie commune (with Brian H. Dierker and Catherine Keener) offers female companionship (in the form of waif Kristen Stewart, who knows how to woik cut-offs); and a doddering Hal Holbrook tearfully offers family, asking if Chris wouldn't mind being adopted as a son.<br/><br/>In retrospect, we see that Penn compresses McCandless's journals to present us with only these clichés, but while viewing, the characters are oddly compelling. We are rooting for McCandless to make his journey, yet we also want him to experience the fullness of life as WE have become accustomed to it (i.e. take the new car your father offers to buy for you; plonk the sexy chick before you walk away; at least take your Blackberry, dude...).<br/><br/>For anyone raised happily in First World society, it would take a lot to convince him or her of Chris's determination to get away from it. Emil Hirsch sells Chris's wanderlust state of mind and body completely.<br/><br/>When Chris arrives in Alaska, the searing beauty and welcome quietude lasts only as long as it takes to realize that the land is unforgiving to idealistic puny humans who were not born and raised into it. Chris finds an abandoned ""Magic Bus"" and sets up a cozy HQ from which to drink in grand vistas, hunt and store food, but soon comes to realize the folly of drawing all his wilderness knowledge from books.<br/><br/>Chris narrates the realities of killing a big animal for food - a moose; in a disturbing scene, he is one man with a small knife, trying desperately to cut it into small pieces, but he cannot cure and cook the meat before the flies leave it crawling with maggots, making the death of this magnificent beast worthless. He writes, ""One of the greatest tragedies of my life - shooting the moose"" and tearfully relinquishes it to the wild, watching the wolves and bald eagles pick at the flesh. ""... clearly felt the presence of a forest not bound to be kind to man. It was a place of heathenism and superstitious rites, to be inhabited by men nearer akin to the rocks and wild animals than we."" <br/><br/>Chris must have been one wicked misanthrope to abjure the embrace of humankind. Yet there is hypocrisy in people who wish to excise themselves from the world of man and yet leave behind a journal for the world of man to read. Writing is the provenance of creatures who perceive a future; anyone who engages in lyrical flourishes like the above passage is writing for other people to read them eventually.<br/><br/>And we see that this is true, for Chris fully intended to return to the world, his Walden experiment having run its course through his veins. That's when Penn springs the dramatic hook on us: when Chris realizes life is only good when shared, it is too late. He writes (still fantasizing about that book deal, we presume), ""I have literally become trapped in the wild."" <br/><br/>Penn is unflinching, showing us not only the grandeur of Chris's adventure, but also its fatal mistakes. Chris eats a poison plant by mistake, that suppresses appetite, thereby killing its victim slowly. For author Krakauer to reconstruct Chris's last days from journal entries and other evidence, Chris must have been a pathological writer to document the symptoms of his death even as it slowly overtook him, Emil Hirsch doing a Reverse RAGING BULL and turning skeletal before our eyes, his final moments spent in agony yet gazing up at the open sky.<br/><br/>I always wonder, with these wilderness guys, how an ailment like kidney stones, or a thorn stabbed into the foot turning it gangrenous, or - like Hanks in CAST AWAY - a decayed tooth, would make them feel about hanging out so far from drugs and busty nurses.<br/><br/>But in the film's final narrated words of elation, Penn allows Chris the benefit of the doubt that he enjoyed his life to its end. Free. ""What if I were smiling... and running into your arms... would you see then... what I see now?"" Whatever he might have meant by that enigmatic passage - that every person's perception of happiness is wildly different - Chris achieved what I believe was his most joyous goal: immortality.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","I don't usually watch movies like this, but I walked into a room last and it was on. I honestly had no idea what I was looking at except that I saw Vince Vaughn and Emile Hirche (I'm sure that is spelled wrong). Into the Wild was spectacular, breathtaking and compelling to say the least. I sat and watched it with my home girls and we were all three enthralled by it. The messages behind the movie, the acting done by Johnny Truelove, it was outstanding. The only thing I'd ever heard of the movie is that older gentleman was nominated for an Oscar, and it's a shame he didn't win it, I was pushed to tears at the end of his performance. I highly recommend this movie to anybody, its a movie to make you think about your life. I was shocked."
"jazzpiano-","10","9","21","4 December 2007"," Into The Wild
","I've read a lot of professional and amateur reviews for this film, and about half begin with, ""This film is just about some spoiled brat with high hopes and no brains!"" And I would say ""Yes, it is, BUT..."", because by the end the main character completes a 'character arc'.<br/><br/>You have to remember that Chris McCandless was young and motivated by the idea that rejecting the materialistic ideology of the Western society he was raised in, his parents overbearing superficialness and unhappy domestic history would attain freedom. This motivated him to go and find freedom in the wild, specifically, Alaska. However, before he gets to Alaska he hitchhikes for two years and meets a series of influential characters. A lot of the time these characters provide comic relief, but when Chris leaves them after forming an emotional bond, you realise that he isn't a great person and that these characters serve to indicate this selfish aspect of Chris' character. But that's okay - you don't have to like Chris! But that said, Chris is hard not to like; when you strip away all his selfish actions you get a handsome and charming man.<br/><br/>However, you have to accept as a viewer that Chris was real, and all *real* people are flawed. He does selfish things, he hurts people and people hurt him. That is life. But he is not all bad, none of us are! If you look for the good you will find it - sometimes he's quite a decent guy.<br/><br/>Sean Penn has structured the film in several chapters that ascend like this, ""Birth"", ""Manhood"" etc. I'm not sure if I liked this aspect of the film. On one hand, it gives Chris' journey another dimension i.e. His journey encapsulates the journey we all go through in our lives. But sometimes I thought it was a little too ambitious to apply that to one man's idealistic and eventually fatal adventure. I also hated how the main title ""Into The Wild"" morphed from cool yellow handwriting into ugly green block letters - perhaps it was meant to symbolise the rejection of aesthetic comforts? But some aspects of the film I did really like, such as the sensitive and touching voice-over of Chris' sister during the film. In that way, there are three narratives running simultaneously through the film: Chris' family (represented by his sister's voice-over and flashbacks), Chris' hitchhiking adventures (used to show aspects of his character), and Chris in Alaska (the real trial of his adventure, providing many climaxes in the movie, and the final stage of his character arc). This structure is very sophisticated I think (opposed to some reviewers who call the film 'confused' and 'jumbled'), and really draws us deeper into the film.<br/><br/>While some people can't be drawn in by how repulsed they are by this rich kid's selfishness and typical anti-society 'tude, the ending serves to change your mind. Chris goes out there to get freedom, because he thinks: <br/><br/>Freedom = Happiness <br/><br/>However, he realises that happiness must be shared for it to mean anything. He also discards the immature alias he gave himself when he was still an ideologically motivated idiot - Alexander Supertramp - and realises everything must be called by its right name, and accepts himself for who he is - Chris McCandless. In the end, this film evolves into a touching coming-of-age story, having been a riveting adventure story, road movie and family drama.<br/><br/>Now for technical aspects of the film (it deserves at least five stars for this alone!) - beautiful cinematography; the shots of Alaska are incredible. The acting - Emile Hirsh is absolutely perfect. There are no Oscar moments; the performance as a whole is complete, perfect and understated. Some of his improvisations are hilarious. The supporting actors are all brilliant, especially Hal Holbrook as Mr. Franz and Kristen Stewart as the young, horny singer Tracy. Chris' partings with Hal Holbrook and Tracy are the most heart-wrenching. Chris rejects a flourishing romantic relationship for his freedom. This makes his realisation that he needs to share it even sadder.<br/><br/>My final opinion on the film is that it is well-made, and deserves to be respected, just for all the hard work that has gone into it. Hirsch's dedication to the role and Penn's dedication and sensitivity to the story and Chris' memory. There's only three things left that concern me: <br/><br/>1) The representation of Chris as a hero/Jesus. There were moments when I thought Penn was casting Chris as too much of a heroic figure, when we have to remind ourselves that he wasn't - he was young, motivated and ill-prepared. As much as it pains me to say this insensitive-sounding statement, I have to: his death does not make him a hero. If he had come back alive, would there be a film? I worry about these things. What if the river had NOT become so wide and Chris had been able to return? What if Chris had come back and integrated into society? Would there be a film? <br/><br/>2) His family's involvement in the making of the film - how much power did they have? Have they changed representations of themselves? How objective is this film? Objectivity can never be achieved, but I worry if the family made themselves look better for the film. I think the character arc I see concerning Chris' parents is very likely to have really occurred, but how do I know for sure? I don't know.<br/><br/>3) Hypocrisy? Is Chris a hypocrite for living in an abandoned bus in Alaska? No, because it wasn't his goal to abandon modern technology, it was his goal to abandon the restrictions of a superficial society, such as having a definite identity and set future.<br/><br/>P.S. I haven't read the book; I'm judging the film on its own merits."
"jkebttn71","10","5","10","21 March 2009"," where are all its Oscars?
","1.) Sean Penn is an outstanding actor, however his directing skills in this outshine any performance he has given. Emile Hirsch gives an outstanding performance (something hard to come by in such young actors) in this emotionally life changing film. I don't know why the academy did not recognise it or why Hirsch has not been approached by other filmmakers for his staggeringly good acting skills. 2.) The cinematography, location filming and art-house (but not too surreal) direction is perhaps the best I've seen, ever. 3.) The story is true which makes the film even more powerful and emotionally charging (cryable). 4.) The co-stars are all outstanding despite not getting a lot of screen time. 5.) before this film I had never heard of how Chris macandles gave his life's savings to charity and went into the wild. And finally the script/ journey itself is phenomenal and the moral of the film and everything Macandles stood for is so true. it will open your eyes to the true meaning of life."
"david-546","8","5","10","11 June 2008"," Worthy of a Darwin
","Okay. I actually quite loved this movie. There was definitely something about his spirit that was worthy of your admiration. Clearly in reading many of the reviews many people were moved by Chris McCandless's spirit. And as I understand it many have trekked north themselves turning Chris's bus (you mean it is still there?) into a shrine.<br/><br/>Indeed it is very difficult to fault the film which after all centered on Chris's spirit and did not try to turn it into a debate. But sorry to throw a dash of realism on this but Chris's ""into the wild"" was worthy of a Darwin award. Trekking off into the wilderness with nothing more than his backpack, minimum equipment and supplies, little in the way of food except for his 10 pound bag of rice and worst of all no compass and no topographic map is not worthy of heroism and admiration it is just plain stupid. Good thing that James Galien gave him those boots. At least he had something.<br/><br/>The reality was Chris was sitting barely a 1/4 of a mile away from a tram that could have gotten him across the river and to safety. He essentially came apart after discovering that he couldn't cross the river (yes those rivers up there can be low and shallow sometimes and raging torrents at other times). I have been to the Yukon and Alaska and believe me it is absolutely stunningly beautiful country but if you wander into the wild without proper preparation it is a totally unforgiving.<br/><br/>It was I admit a poignant moment when Chris in a deteriorating and emaciated state crossed paths with the grizzly bear that wandered into his camp. That the bear didn't tear him apart and into dinner was more to the credit of the bear. He probably took one look at the guy thought to himself ""what a puny looking excuse for a human being"". The bear got it right. Eating bones just wasn't worth it.<br/><br/>There was also a wonderful scene between Chris and Ron Franz who was played by Hal Holbrook. Knowing already the fate of Chris the scene in the car as they said their goodbyes was very emotional. No wonder the wonderful veteran actor Holbrook received a well deserved Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>Chris - you are a beautiful guy - but so dumb. And of course sadly no longer with us. But I loved your spirit and the film was a beautiful obituary."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","5","10","28 February 2008"," Beautiful
","Into the Wild (2007) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Sean Penn's magical film based on the life of Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who after graduating college donated his life savings to charity so that he could go on a tour year tour of the country, which would leave him alone and dead at the age of 24 in the wilderness of Alaska. With both The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard Penn showed signs of greatness but both films were highly flawed. With The Pledge he showed that he could create a masterpiece and he's done that yet again with this film, which is one of the most refreshing, spiritual and magical films of recent memory. I guess you could call this a message film but that might be an insult since the movie is so much more than that. I'm not sure I could put into words all the meanings behind the movie but it certainly makes you think about your life as the character is doing as he's going on with his journey of trying to find something, which he might have had all along but just didn't notice it. Penn's direction is terrific throughout as he tells the story of this young man and the director doesn't hit a wrong note throughout the 150-minutes. The music score contains classic songs as well as new acoustic material by Eddie Veddar and really captures the mood and freeness of the film. The cinematography is downright beautiful from start to finish and really captures the beauty of the various locations. The greatest thing are the performances, which are all very rich and certainly worth of Oscar talk. Hirsch goes through a lot of changes both physically and mentally and the actor perfectly captures all of this. The way he goes from the free child to simply a child lost in the world was incredibly touching. The supporting performances are just as great and features William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as his parents, Brian Dieker and Catherine Kenner as a hippie couple and Vince Vaughn as a hard drinking man who gives Hirsch a job. Hal Holbrook is also very touching as an old man who realizes that he hasn't fully lived his life after tragedy hit him. As with Penn's previous films, this is a very serious look at life, love and the meaning of it all and the director doesn't pull any punches. Penn has been given credit for being one of the greatest actors of his generation but he's quickly becoming one of the greatest directors out there. This isn't a movie for dummies as it forces the viewers to think and there's not a better movie out there for that."

","I've read through the User Comments and have found a variety of opinions about the film, Chris McCandless and the book from which Sean Penn adapted his film. McCandless was certainly no hero and the Forest Service in Alaska has been quite blunt in their feelings about a young man going into the wilderness without ample preparation. I can only offer my own opinion, which is of the film itself.<br/><br/>As a stellar example of film-making, I loved this movie and found it to be beautiful in every respect as well as immensely touching. The acting was excellent without exception. Emile Hirsch (according to an interview with Penn) put everything he had into the role and I believe that this young man will have a bright future as an actor. To me, the other standout was Hal Holbrook. I've already posted my thoughts in the Forum about the heart breaking farewell scene between Ron (Holbrook) and Chris (Hirsch). I'm in my mid 70s and I really felt Ron's aching pain at having to say goodbye to someone who brought joy to his lonely life. This film and especially that scene have stayed with me ever since I saw it several days ago.<br/><br/>I expect that ""Into the Wild"" will garner some Oscar nominations (actor, supporting actor, director, cinematography, score) and will most likely win a few.

"cineastFGD","5","3","5","14 June 2017"," Hm
","I have very mixed feelings about this movie. The movie itself is great, it's beautiful, well-cut, entertaining, the story is well laid out, and the acting is great. If this movie was just trying to tell the story as is, it would be fine. Unfortunately it seems like they try to make a hero out of a very immature, very selfish, and - sorry - very, very silly young man. <br/><br/>I'm sure Christopher McCandless was a nice young man who is missed by his family, and I feel for their loss. But he was also an overly naive person who basically knew nothing of life but seemed to live under the illusion of possessing great wisdom. Well, if you know even a little bit about the wilderness, then you probably know that there is nothing romantic about it. Surviving in the wild is tough, requires a lot of knowledge and experience, and for us humans, often the help of other humans. And if you don't have all this, then at least have the brains to bring a compass and a map so that you find home again when the s*** hits the fan. <br/><br/>It somehow angers me that this movie tries to stylize this story as a romantic experiment accidentally gone wrong. No, the only possible outcome by default was that this will go wrong, period. Christopher McCandless was an irresponsible, naive young guy, who has needlessly killed himself and most probably brought a lot of pain over his family and friends. There is really nothing to admire here."

He turned his back on his family and just went into the wild with no money, no credit card, nothing - not thinking of anyone but himself. I commented how cruel this was to his family, while my daughter saw him as some kind of hero. The movie was called ""Into the Wild"" and was directed by Sean Penn.The truth is, this boy was an true narcissist. He withdrew all affection, love and respect for the people who gave him everything, and he found this somehow justifiable. His highly destructive behavior hurt people, but he did not care that this was a form of undeserved emotional abuse. He used this form of manipulation against his family as simply as cheating in a game of monopoly, with no consequence. He psychologically 'murdered' his family for his own ""so-called"" search for happiness.Too many kids today think it is just okay to hurt, abuse and step on the people who have cared about them their entire lives. These kids are part of the ""why"" generation. Why must I follow the rules? Why do I know so much more than you, and why don't you appreciate my intelligence and worldly being? They make rash judgments and then post it to the world like they are a true martyr. But the question is, how far will these kids go until they realize they've eaten poison or drank the kool-aide, and ruined what could have been a love-filled life? Will they take it to the point when they realize their ""romantic"" notions are not realistic at all? And when they realize this, will it be too late? Will it be after another life has been viciously destroyed by abuse and hate? And will they be able to live with the destruction they have caused?"

","This film recounts the true story of Chris McCandless, a young man who decided to drop out of society and go live in the wilds of Alaska. Penn should stick to his day job. He employs every cinematic cliché known to man in an attempt to romanticize the story and portray the McCandless as a hero. Apparently McCandless was so charming that he instantly bonded with everyone he met on his journey, and everyone he met was a hippie. However, based on the evidence presented here, the guy was nothing more than a pretentious, self-absorbed, and irresponsible jerk who put his family through hell. Slow motion is utilized in every other scene, effectively doubling the length of the film."
"Hunky Stud","4","3","5","25 August 2010"," Very boring, he is NOT a hero at all,he died for nothing, period.
","Well, I usually agree with the ratings on this site, but I am surprised about this high rating for this movie. It is definitely overrated. I rated it a 6.<br/><br/>It is very boring, too long. And the scenes jump back and forth, so it was a little confusing. When I watch a boring movie like this, I read a book, magazine, newspaper while it plays on the background. And that is what I did when I watched this DVD. It was so boring that I had to watch it in three nights.<br/><br/>The only reason that they made this movie is because he is a white guy from a middle class family. It is just that simple.<br/><br/>There are plenty of street bums like him living on the streets, in the wild. They don't bath, they don't eat proper food, they are dirty all over. I am sure that you can find some veterans who fought in some glorious wars, who ended up living on the streets just like him. How come they don't make a movie about those people? Did this guy do anything great? nothing. Did he save anyone's life? No. So what is so great about this guy? nothing.<br/><br/>He could have used those free time to volunteer to save the world, instead he chose to live his life without any purpose. In a way, you can say that this guy is weird, he thinks differently than normal people. He thought that he was invisible, so he didn't have a cell phone, just in case there is an emergency.<br/><br/>Yes, it is sad that he died, but he is just an ordinary man. People die all the time.<br/><br/>Suppose that someone made another movie about a non-white homeless man who traveled all the way to Alaska to live in the wild, what rating will that movie get? Surely, not many white people will like to watch that even though the story will be exactly the same."
"dayXexists","5","3","5","22 June 2010"," Pretentious and Smug. Salvaged by beautiful cinematography and fantastic acting
","So I finally got around to seeing this and well, it looks like I'm going to have to disagree with the majority on this one.<br/><br/>First there are several things I did like about it. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The various shots of nature around different parts of the country are beautiful. I think Sean Penn's direction was great- he really captured the essence of the wanderer's lifestyle and even makes the viewer a little envious of some of those people. I thought the supporting cast was fantastic, and I found myself caring about those characters much more than I did the main character. Especially Hal Holbrook and Katherine Creener. I think she is a very underrated and talented actress. Even Kristen Stewart was OK in her small part.<br/><br/>That said, I thought the movie was extremely pretentious and smug. If people thought The Blind Side was a white-guilt film, then this is a societal-guilt film. It's one thing if a movie lets the story convey the message for you, but Into the Wild jams that message down your throat. After a while it's like, okay, I get it. Society is rigid and restricting, free your spirit, etc. Well sorry Alexander Supertramp, but not everyone can just ditch their responsibilities to loaf around the country and get in touch with nature.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the main character, Chris, who I thought was completely selfish and melodramatic. His ""tragic"" back story really wasn't all that tragic. So his Dad screwed around and his parents didn't get along. Welcome to life. That kid's parents gave him everything he ever needed and asked for and yet he acts like he's some damaged, abused child. And then he leaves, never contacts them again, and goes and gets himself killed. I don't have any sympathy for that and I stopped caring for the character pretty shortly into the film. The 2 and a half hour run time was a bit long for me, and like I said, after a while I got tired of Chris complaining about society. I did like that in the final minutes the character does seem to feel a little remorse with the ""happiness is not true unless it is shared"" bit though.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch for his part did a good job. I wasn't crazy about his performance like others seem to be, but it's a very challenging role and he deserves credit. I don't remember who else was nominated that year, but he probably deserved at least a nomination.<br/><br/>Anyway while there were many positive things that I enjoyed about the movie, I just can't get past the pretentiousness of it all. It is a good message but this just felt like 2.5 hours worth of teen angst to me.<br/><br/>C+ (for the acting, direction, and photography)"
"chillipit","4","3","5","3 March 2010"," A bratty kid decides reject society and rough it in the wild
","It was hard to feel sympathy for the kid. The first tantrum he threw in the restaurant after his parents wanted to buy him a car made me dislike him and from that point on my mind was made, he was a brat. No matter how hard the actor or the script tried nothing could make me like him and nothing could make me symphathise with him. Poor little rich kid. He shuns society to become supertramp but every step of his journey is marked by society's influence. He pays for a book to help him find stuff to eat. The Magic Bus offers warmth and a bed. When he goes back into town he asks a mission for a place to stay. The list goes on, he couldn't have enjoyed his lifestyle choice without society and it's influence. He was nothing more than a rebel without a cause. It's just really sad that Hollywood would want to immortalise him on film."
"jurassicmarc","3","3","5","9 December 2009"," Well shot and well acted.......but overlong and its principle character was a fool.
","Where do I start with this movie. Firstly I was overwhelmed by the praise this movie got on release. I went into it knowing little about Mc Candless and when the movie had finished I wasn't sure why I should know or want to know who he was. I cant understand how this man is an inspiration for anyone, he was clearly a selfish person who cared for nothing other than his way. There was nothing really to like about him he started off coming across as a spoilt teenager and continued to be that way throughout the duration of the film. We get some very good acting from all involved its just a shame that its all wasted telling the story of a person who really made no contribution to anyone or anything. That said the cinematography was amazing and the music was pretty good at times although I expected a little more from Vedder if im honest. Sean Penn is a pretty good director but I think maybe i just couldn't connect with the subject matter. I found the experience, frustrating and dull peppered with some nice images, but on the whole its 2hrs I would like back."

","Into the wild <br/><br/>In the movie into the wild there are a few people I would like to talk about, Chris and his family. Chris' mom and dad gave Chris love, but the way Chris sees it is just because they have money to buy him things don't mean that they love him; so Chris wanted to make money on his own. I like this movie very much, because I never read about anyone like Chris. The way Chris thinks is kinda crazy, but Chris did what he had to do; he didn't count on anyone but himself; he worked hard for his money and he had a few jobs like working at Mcdonalds and on farms. As Chris traveled he met new people that like him and want two adopt him into their family. One family lived in a trailer park, and Chris stayed with them for a while. This is the time Chris met a girl, and she was in love with Chris, but Chris said she was too young for him. What do I think about Chris? I think he is stupid, crazy, and hopeless. He did dumb things to himself. I don't know why. He had a sister who cared for him very much, but he just didn't care like his sister did."

I went on a four year road trip and purposely left my folks hanging for a year. It turned my father's hair white. My mom later told me of wondering if she would get a call that they had found me lying dead in a ditch somewhere. I never failed to keep in touch after that. Folks, if you come up here and plan to stray very far from your cruise ship/tour bus/rental car, just remember that much better people than this guy die all the time for many reasons.

","i read this book about 4 years ago. i randomly found it at a coffee shop/bookstore in Greenville NC where you could read books for free while sipping a cappuccino and eating a scone for $10. ha-ha. the book was engrossing and as my older sister went to Emory university as well, i was fascinated by this character/real guy who was brilliant and graduated from that rigorous university with honors and then decided to scrap a career for living as a nomad. the book is extremely well written and although i like Emile Hirsch, he was poor casting. he can act, but i felt he's too young to even play Chris who from the book seemed a TALL, ahead of his time, cocky college graduate. Hirsch is too cocky, too full of himself and sort of knee jerk about everything. the Chris in the book is much more thoughtful, calculating, and mature than he's portrayed. also, the character development is bad. you never get inside Chris at all. this book is hard to adapt. because you don't want to pass up the godliness of that landscape that Chris traversed and Penn does encapsulate it in his filming. however, the movie is more an adventure story than a true biography (which it should have been) of a unique young brash man who was in over his head. i didn't even like the casting of hurt or harden either. i again pictured his parents to be more like perhaps Donald Sutherland/Mary Tyler Moore (i'm serious). it's a watchable movie and entertaining. but if you had read the book, it's simply a huge disappointment because it doesn't even skim the surface of the rite of passage this guy tries to take and fails at as nature overwhelmed and defeated him. the oldest story ever told."

","Sad Sad Sad! <br/><br/>This movie was 2 hours to long the way it was edited. Should have been a short story film at Sundance. Good support acting and could have maybe been a great mini series (5 or 6 2 hour episodes might do it) if the film editor could have spent a week or two in the wild and gotten a true understanding of the fortitude that it takes to survive in the harshest of elements and really had the time to edit for an epic of a mini-series not the big screen! <br/><br/>Penn's heart strings were twanging at trying to bring this true story to the big screen. He would have been better off making a mini-series where he really could have taken the time to tell the ""REAL TRUE SAGA"" of this young mans demise. Every time you would start to get enthralled with an adventure of this young man's life they would jump you in time to another character study and the trials and trepidations of growing up in a world of dysfunctional people. Sink or swim is the adage that comes to mind or the strong shall survive. Either way my recommendation would be to wait for the DVD!"

"jborowsky3","1","4","8","4 May 2019"," Completely unsympathetic and overdone
","Did not like one character in this movie. Reading the other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only person who couldn't stand the main character. He talked about hypocrites and he was the biggest one of all. Did not like the sister's narration. It attempted to make the two of them sympathetic characters but it didn't work. It just sounded like a spoiled kid making excuses and trying to claim they had this horrible childhood when they didn't. Any casting of Kristen Stewart is a mistake. She has no acting ability. She's always monotone and expressionless. The soundtrack also attempted to make the movie meaningful but made it overdone and sappy. The best part was the main character getting beat up by the self appointed border patrol guy. I may keep in mind the weight loss tips as evidenced by the many scenes of his belt tightening or making new holes in the leather - walk a lot and live on water and plants. I also feel that McCandless's death was suicide by starvation in an attempt to martyr himself."

","Simply stunning real-life account of college graduate who simply disowns and ditches the American society, lifestyle - and his parents - to make a life in the midwestern/Alaskan wilderness. Along his path he also encounters and affects a handful of diverse people in both profound and truthful ways... <br/><br/>A clearly victorious labor of love for director Penn, as it uses voice-over, appropriately themed songs and nature philosophy quotes (if a few too many) just as effectively as the beauty of nature's scenery itself to tell an Americana (and the fate of quite a man) like no other. An honest, heartfelt celebration of following a dream of freedom and simplicity - gaspingly well made - that resonates even deeper, of course, if you agree on its values and statements (like me). Rousseau smiles in his grave! Also astonishingly, effortlessly acted down the line with a fantastic Hirsch (who to me is an uncanny cross between Johnny Depp & River Phoenix!) in the lead; it wouldn't work without his performance.

"drobino","8","4","8","6 June 2008"," Unpredictable, but on the money
","When I spotted an advertisement for this film in a British newspaper, complete with rave reviews, my interest was piqued enough that I looked it up on IMDb, saw the 8+/10 rating and read a couple of the bits of trivia and thought ""Fantastic."" and pretty much ran down to the video library.<br/><br/>The initial comment I made to the friends with whom I watched the film was: ""Hmm. That was a little different to what I was expecting."" - and therein, I fear, lies the rub. The problem with having expectations built up about a slightly unusual sort of film is that they are, almost inevitably, confounded. I would point to the example of Napoleon Dynamite; a totally different sort of film that can be hugely enjoyable if one watches it with no expectations of any kind (as I did); or lame nonsense if the film has been raved about by your friends (as happened for one of my friends who disliked ND).<br/><br/>However I was curious as to what most of the negative reviews of this film said - almost without exception, they seem to have come from people who have little to no idea about how to critique a film of this kind, and while I am no professional critic I would point out the following.<br/><br/>The production values of this film are outstanding. There are any number of light touches of camera-work and editing that quietly assert the thought and effort that have gone into this film; so that to rate it anywhere below 7/10 is shameful. I need not go to any lengths to heap further praise on the soundtrack. Penn's casting and directing skills, likewise, cannot be questioned. The film felt so authentic that it was frequently more akin to watching a documentary than a screenplay; most of the bit-part characters (ie. the lesser roles; not the parts played by Hurt, Harden, Keener, Holbrook and Vaughn) felt so real that I wondered if they were professional actors at all - thinking that if so, they were outstanding. The decision to film exclusively on location, while perhaps obvious by film-making standards, is a brave one considering that filming in Canada, for example, would have sacrificed comparatively little in return for the financial savings.<br/><br/>The biggest problem in terms of reception, it seems, is in Penn's dialogue - the screenplay itself. Not having read Krakauer's book, I feel it is not something I can criticise fairly. A number of the adverse comments about the film posted on IMDb seem to rage against holding McCandless up as some kind of role model - sorry folks, you've missed the point. The art of cinema is one of STORY-TELLING. Penn is telling a story of a young man who lived by his ideals. Does anyone have the right to question the beliefs of another? Or to criticise an artistic portrayal of such a tale based on fact on the grounds of plot? Expect an engaging story, well-told, and enjoy Penn's direction and Hirsch's performance."
"gelman@attglobal.net","4","4","8","11 May 2008"," Possible Spoilers: Cold-Hearted Me
","The best thing about ""Into the Wild"" is Hal Holbrook, the venerable actor whose name will forever be associated with his traveling one-man show, ""Mark Twain Tonight!"" Here he is utterly convincing as a solitary old man who befriends Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch's character) on his way to the Alaska wilderness and offers to adopt him as his grandson, having lost his wife and only child in a head-on collision with a drunk driver. But the focus, of course, is on McCandless, who is fleeing his parents (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt) and his own middle class life. I haven't read the book on which the movie is based and I don't intend to. Chris McCandless may be a real person but his story isn't all that interesting. Moreover, since he communicated directly with no one, not even his beloved sister (Jena Malone), his story has to be conjectural and its reconstruction on the screen is unconvincing. Frankly, I couldn't bring myself to care much about him or his reasons for ditching his parents or their pain. I kept wondering, however, why he never bothered to communicate with his sister, whom he supposedly loved. That he undertook an adventure for which he was essentially unprepared and eventually died because he could not cross back over the fast-flowing river he had originally forded during the winter when it was reduced to a trickle did not move me and his slow starvation was not heart-breaking because I was impatient for the movie to end."
"death-hilarious","7","4","8","13 September 2007"," Lots of heart
","Into the wild is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless who after graduating college from a well to do family, donated his life savings to charity, left all his possessions, and without telling anyone set off with dreams of roughing it in the wilds of Alaska. After two years of criss-crossing through America and running into a host of interesting characters, he finally managed to hitch-hike to Alaska, where four months after his arrival his decomposing corpse was discovered by moose hunters. He had starved to death, apparently as a result of eating a poisonous variety of seed. It's a simple, but very compelling tale.<br/><br/>While director Sean Penn's treatment is full of heart, the movie is almost sunk early by sheer melodrama, especially in the voice overs given to Jena Malone who plays Carine McCandless, Christopher's sister. It almost seems as if at times Penn is trying to make a messianic figure out of the young McCandless, depicting him wiser than his years, healing the broken lives of those he comes across. It would have been better to just humanize McCandless and have the faith that by those standards he would measure well enough. Once the movie progresses past the family back-story, told in regrettable voice over, the movie picks up. The portrait of McCandless that emerges once he gets some more speaking time is actually quite detailed capturing everything from his bookish idealism and his obstinate wanderlust, to his love of beauty and pure joy in the experience of life. A lot of this has to do with the wonderful performance by Emile Hirsch, who gives just the type of performance that only an actor-director is able to get from their actors. Unfortunately, the movie runs far too long, because of some indulgent editing, and loses a lot of its force because of it.<br/><br/>While I have a lot of reservations about the film, one thing you can't take away from it is that Penn has managed to create an impassioned portrait of a fascinating young man."
"howard.schumann","9","6","14","21 October 2007"," Sweet, thoughtful, and deeply moving
","Chris McCandless, a young man of twenty four took his last breath in this world in August 1992 - alone. Found starved to death in an abandoned bus in Denali Park, near Fairbanks, Alaska, he had left his affluent home in the Southern U.S. after graduating from Emery College, tuned in to the call of the wild, turned on to the spirit of Jack Kerouac and Henry Thoreau, and dropped out of a society he rejected for its commercialism and greed. Directed by Sean Penn and based on Jon Krakauer's book about Chris' life, Into the Wild is a celebration of youth with its idealism, desire for adventure, and also its arrogance and short-sightedness. Penn, who seems deeply connected to his subject, consulted with Chris' parents after waiting ten years for their approval to undertake this project. The reuslt is a sweet, thoughtful, and deeply moving film but, like its main protagonist, full of contradictions.<br/><br/>The debate over whether Chris was a highly evolved truth seeker or a vengeful and self destructive personality is not answered either in the book or the film. Ever looking for the real McCandless, Penn fills in the gaps with a semi-idealized version but since the only knowledge we have of the real person is from Chris' journals, letters, novels and poems, and the thoughts of his sister Carine (Jena Malone) narrated in voice-over, who he was remains maddeningly elusive. In spite of Chris' ultimate discovery about the true nature of happiness, Into the Wild is not a message film but a voyage of discovery in which a headstrong young man gradually acquires the wisdom to reach out to others, even to his parents in a fevered dream. More than a story about a return to nature, or a white middle class youth's protest against his parent's values, it is a search for authenticity in a world that has forgotten what truth looks and feels like.<br/><br/>Chris is engagingly played by Emile Hirsch who had to ride the rapids of the Colorado River and lose 45 pounds in the process of making the film. He brings a quality of instant likability to his role, though at times he skirts around the edges of the character without fully inhabiting him. The film is divided into four chapters that signal Chris's growing maturity. It begins in Alaska, then flashes back to the two-year journey that brought him to this point. Along the way, he gives away his $24,000 inheritance to charity, burns all of his money, abandons his car, changes his name, and hitchhikes across the country and up to Alaska, never once communicating with his distraught family.<br/><br/>It was part of Chris' contradiction that he rejected human relationships, yet was able to give of himself to those he met along the way. He makes a friend of Wayne (Vince Vaughn) his boss as a farm worker in South Dakota, an 81-year old retired veteran (Hal Holbrook) who offers to adopt him, a 16 year-old singer-songwriter (Kristen Stewart), and a pair of aging free spirits Rainey and Jana (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker). These contacts appear to be genuine but McCandless keeps his distance. When Jana tells Chris about her own son who ran away and hasn't been heard from in two years, he seems curiously unmoved and is silent when Jana tells him how children are often cruel to their parents.<br/><br/>Backed by original songs by Eddie Vedder that never seem discordant, Into the Wild is a beautiful film that should be remembered at Oscar time, if only for Hal Holbrook's masterful supporting performance. Though it occasionally lapses into clichés such as Chris telling Tracy that ""If you want something in life, reach out and grab it"" and melodramatic scenes where the sun emerges from the clouds just at the right moment, the film has a grasp of the grit of life and ultimately becomes transcendent. While we may rightly view Chris' short life as a tragedy, but as Albert Einstein says, ""the real tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives"".<br/><br/>Whatever else could be said about Chris, and as a parent I am appalled by his cruelty in refusing to contact his mother and father or even his sister for a period of two years, to him life was a game that was only worth playing 100%. Those who refuse to take risks in life may stand in judgment of McCandless and call him stupid, yet some have forgotten what it is like to be young and some never knew. He made mistakes, serious errors of judgment, yet in the end I am reminded of what George Bernard Shaw says, ""I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no ""brief candle"" for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations."" Chris McCandless life was a candle that burned brightly on both ends, then flickered and died but what he has passed on to us is a splendid torch."

"blackburnj-1","5","5","11","21 December 2007"," Dull, weightless and dreadfully earnest
","The tragic story of Christopher McCandless is given the ultra-worthy treatment by Sean Penn in this ultimately dull and weightless film that tells a potentially very good story very badly.<br/><br/>The problems with the film are numerous. First off, there is no notion of quest as Penn decides to start the film off with the beginning of the end in Alaska, thus removing any potential suspense in McCandless' quest. Then, the film goes along at a glacial pace with very few events of interest to speak of. As it crawls on, the inter-cutting between the main story and the Alaska finale destroys the narrative and ultimately the story. This wouldn't matter if there were a point to the film.<br/><br/>This proves to be elusive. Half of the film seems to be saying that nature's stunning and brilliant. Excellent, but I knew that before and why are you taking two hours and a half to tell me this. The rest of it is focused on the character of McCandless, who is here portrayed as being ludicrously idealistic, to the point of annoyance. He appears to be on a quest to discover truth and honesty and yet he has as his hero a ""great man"" who is arrested by the FBI under serious criminal charges. The character's nature and story provides no empathy, pathos or message. There is a notion of identity that develops but it is heavily embedded in a lot of other material that makes the notion difficult to access. It isn't properly dealt with anyway.<br/><br/>There are a few positives in this film. The soundtrack is nice to listen to, and it did a lot to escape the tedium of the rest of the film. There are a couple of excellent performances. Catherine Keener is the standout, whilst Emile Hirsch is impressive, though not a revelation, in the main role. There are also a couple of nice sequences, especially the one at the slabs, and the natural surroundings look stunning.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately let down by its helmsman, Penn, who writes not so much a script as a collage, and directs the film in a manner that shows a lot of observation though little understanding of the nature of film-making (e.g. styles of shooting and editing are used neither to create effect or meaning but just for the sake of using them). It is also amateurish in places. He has McCandless, in a scene where he is talking to an apple, break the fourth wall for no reason. All that does is alert the audience to the presence of the camera. And, of course, being Penn he can't help but bring a large sociological undertone to the whole proceedings. It is a shame because the majority of people would agree with his politics but he ends up making such a song and dance about them that it feels like he's lecturing you. The prime example of this is the completely inexplicable insertion of a shot of George Bush Snr. announcing the first war on Iraq, which has no bearing on the plot.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but Penn has all the potential of becoming the Michael Moore of narrative cinema - a man who can make good points very badly and great stories very annoying. ""Into the Wild"" is awfully earnest, directed badly to within an inch of its life and commits the worst crime in cinema by being dull. Unless you like that sort of thing, stay away from this."

The story tells you that money is not the only way to get happy ... there are numerous ways which don't require money .... different people have their own ideas of happiness .... you just have to decide which way to choose and reach out and grab it ... e.g : the character felt that he will be happy by living in the wild ALONE, not getting into relationships and bonds ... but his lifestyle didn't permit it ...... so he left everything ... changed his lifestyle and went out to do what he wanted to ... he did what his heart told him ......

"MichaelLibinAP","10","5","11","29 September 2007"," A masterful piece of film-making
","""Into The Wild"" is my favorite book. I was hesitant to see this film, but felt if anyone could do this remarkable story justice, it would be Sean Penn. I was not disappointed. This is a heartbreaking story that does not wallow in pathos. It is a tribute to those among us who march to a different drum. Maybe some viewers will find Christopher McCandless' story pointlessI've heard the hubris arguments alreadybut for those of us who have felt the lure of absolute freedom, the love of unspoiled nature, and the need to find our souls, ""Into The Wild"" is awe- inspiring. Penn's screenplay is succinct and smart, his direction is flawless. The performances Hal Holbrook, Catherine Keener, and Marcia Gay Harden chief among themare superb and Oscar-worthy. But it is doe-eyed Emile Hirsch who is the heart and soul of this film. With so many grand performances swirling around him, he's easy to overlook. But don't. His joyous and painful portrayal of McCandless/Supertramp is a tribute to the real McCandless' innocent spirit."
"oneloveall","5","5","11","27 September 2007"," Somewhat tedious to sit through, haunting in retrospect nonetheless
","I loved the heart of this movie, but it is delivered with such a dull-paced, self-important pandering that I cannot help but feel Penn's romanticized, vicarious camera clouds any real psychological backbone behind our lead's motivations. He is doing a good deed to bring this debatable inspiration to the screen, and at times his reverence for the material really shows. So it is with hesitation to mention that this too-revered interpretation does not contain as much truth as the visual splendor led me to believe. <br/><br/>Emile Hirsch headlines the underwhelming cast, sprouting a cute little man-beard, not-very-believable philosophical manifestos, wide-eyed boyish looks, and little else. In brief moments, at certain angles, when he wears glasses and shaves in a few sequences he reminded me of River Phoenix, which in turn sadly reminded me of what a great young actor could be. I am happy for Hirsch's career, as I see a lot of praise for his (mostly just physical) demanding role here. He has been doing all the right things to branch away from the dreaded ""that guy in The Girl Next Door"" syndrome, but he still has ways to go. Delivery-wise, Hirsch comes across like a younger DiCaprio in The Beach part 2. He just does not have the insight, nor the creativity to make this amazing character really jump off the screen.<br/><br/>We can't really fault the lead too much though, working with an indulgent, preachy, but still lazy script (obviously an angled perspective from the book) and a direction that shows Penn more in love with the idea then the result. Yes, the scenery is often stunning (arguably reason enough to see this anti-cgi beauty in the theater), as nature tends to be. Yes, the film should resonate afterward with the inner romantic or idealist in all of us, perhaps for the finale with an epilogue revealing (to unprepared theater-goers) the fact-based material inspired for this release. But through some murky, melodramatic expository scenes, numbing supporting characters (with rare exception), all awkwardly contrasted to intriguingly put together 24-styled montages, Into the Wild feels more tame, selfish and safe then it's thematic content would suggest."
"aharmas","10","5","11","22 September 2007"," Into the Soul of a Man
","""Into the Wild"" is not the sort of picture that seems to bring to mind Sean Penn. True, he is one of the most passionate, dedicated, and intense performers to work in Hollywood, a man who has given us some of the best performances in the last two decades. What he has done is to go behind the camera and transfered that passion into a work of enormous sympathy, compassion, and spirituality.<br/><br/>In the novel, it is not very clear what drives the obsessive behavior of Alex (Chris). In the movie, the forces are somehow more positive but the results are still tragic, with a slight difference in the tone of the closing scene. It is not the end what matters but the journey, and the journey, as presented by both the novel and especially, this very fine film is something to behold.<br/><br/>The movie takes us back and forth in time and expands on some of the background and motivation behind this young man's odyssey. We are given information as to what happened in his home, and there are still subtle hints as to how he sought and acquire the need to connect with happiness, the one thing he yearned and which, in the final epiphany proves to be somewhat ironic. As played by Hirsch, the revelation is heartbreaking, but as I mentioned before, it's those glorious moments where he somehow connects to what he thinks he wants that raise this film into very special places.<br/><br/>To be able to achieve that, Penn's directorial job is perfectly supported by a truly amazing cast, which includes William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Jena Malone, Vince Vaughn, and in a lovingly portrayal, Hal Holbrook, whose every minute in the screen shows the yearning for companionship and the effects of true love on people. The film clocks in at almost two hours, and every minute is precious, full of emotion, feelings, potent forces that appeal to us, yet simultaneously scare us.<br/><br/>It's gorgeously photographed, and scored with much insight in order to deepen the effect of the story. It's a movie that should be viewed by all, regardless of whether we understand the message at first. The truth is that it's hard to imagine anyone not affected by it."
"stevefz","10","5","11","19 September 2007"," Lost going Into the Wild
","In April of 1992 Christopher McCandless walked into the University of Alaska Fairbanks bookstore, purchased two postcards and a book outlining the local flora of the region. Eight years later I would walk into the very same store, to purchase water for a parched throat as I began my first radio broadcast with my lifelong friend a floor above. The story of McCandless and his endeavor to find truth, life and meaning holds personal meaning to me that goes beyond just the crossing of two men's paths or the Alaskan identity that I hold so dear.<br/><br/>McCandless' story is one of personal triumph over the evils of complacency. He was not defined by the characters he meets over the course of his journey. In reading Into the Wild you understand rather that they were found by his spirit and changed for it. The task of interpretation of a book to screen will always fall short for the reader who created the world, the adventure and the voice in the back addles of their cerebration. In works of fiction, departures are acceptable for the writer, since you are playing in a story that exists nowhere else but between the pages of white. What of the adaption of a true story? One that is constructed from all available facts, every scrap of detail that can be confirmed? When does conjecture to fill screen time betray the anecdotes of the tale? Did Sean Penn accomplish giving justice to the two-year quest McCandless undertook to achieve his great Alaska odyssey? Penn did, and then, he did not.<br/><br/>The beauty of Jon Krakauer's book is how he is able to balance the writings McCandless left behind, with the real world accounts of those that interacted with him. This is all put in contrast with others in time's fold that had similar motivations as McCandless, including the author himself. The conclusions are all left ambiguously to the reader to decide. Was he crazy or enlightenedare these one in the same? Penn takes a more definitive route in the tale, and seeks to answer in certitude. And while his conclusions may contradict my own, this take changes the scope of the film from a 'story based on', to 'a story inspired by.' With his own main stream biases aside, like the use of Eddie Vedder's score that ranges from emotionally moving to emotionally clichéddoes his telling stay true to the spirit of the man's search for meaning? Penn does, and he didn't.<br/><br/>Alaska has never been shown to the Cineplex audience as those who live there see it (and then there are those who never appreciate the land, though they lived there all their lives). Films regarding Alaska have either used the setting as a contrived impression or a romanticized effigy of the past. For example, Out Cold depicts more closely to what the setting could be in Bozeman, Montana than anywhere in Alaska. And then there is the tripe called Mystery, Alaska""which might be a front-runner for disdain with locals, if it weren't for that awful show Northern Exposure.<br/><br/>The cinematographer Eric Gautier captured the sweet essence of the 49th state in its entirety. The master of composition compliments Penn's style of frugal camera moves and eloquent symmetry. There is a shot in the opening sequence set with low light; a water tower is seen in the foreground cast in shadow, with the railroad roundhouse illuminated in the back. That shot is Fairbanks to me. I have spent countless hours near, or literally under that water tower whether it was playing hackie sack with the bag crews, waiting for a trailer to be dropped off full of tourist luggage, or an ill conceived night when we went there late to climb to its apex. The majesty, opalescence, the quiet serenity of the tirrit north is captured as well as hour-long specials on the Discovery Channel. This works to invest the audience in the depiction of Emile Hirsch's Alexander Supertramp whenever he shares his plans with wild-eyed enthusiasm. Yet there are times when he plays dangerously close with a betrayal that comes across more irrationally caustic than should be. If I were to take one point with Penn's script that did not feel right to me, it would be how McCandless met his demise. While he perfectly illustrates how this was not a man who intended on perishing from his lone journey, Penn constructs a absolution to why McCandless died. The plant that could be responsible for his death is not out of the realm of possibility, however he managed to avoid it the entire first 80 to 90 days of his sojourn. Considering his intelligence, matched with the resource at hand (a book about flora in Alaska), it in turn makes him seem foolish, and this does a disservice to the whole of the tale. It's a Hollywood ending that saves from needing an epilogue card, which states what may have caused his starvation.<br/><br/>Alaska is my home, though I no longer hold residence there. One year ago I chose to leave and create a reality out of a dream. While McCandless was never comfortable in the sharp lines of the city, I had become dissatisfied with the limited possibilities of the open countryyet I understand the attraction of his desires. Working in tourism, I have met elderly couples in the twilight of their lives that spent a life's savings to see a mountain called Denali, a river called Nenana, and a city in the summer under the midnight sun. Would we ever had known of a man named Christopher McCandless, a man entranced by the mystique of the north had he not died from leaving civilization and going into the wild?"

","I saw this first at Telluride, then again at a screening in L.A. and have to say it only got better, deeper, and richer the second time around.<br/><br/>""Into The Wild"" is a tour de force from Penn. The cinematography, acting, and sound track are flawless. But what makes it transcendent, and sure to be one of the few films that lasts decades, is the theme that Penn added. He said it was something he got from the book, but I read the book twice and it's not there. Somehow, this came from Penn himself. It's a theme about God's love and forgiveness and gives the episodic structure it's spine and cohesiveness. The end blew me away. A tragic ending, but beautiful and profound at the same time.<br/><br/>From Sean Penn...who knew??"

","I have always loved this movie, so I'll start off by admitting my bias. However, I can't help but read some of the negative comments and feel disappointed that people have missed the point.<br/><br/>At its most basic, this story is about a young man who grows as a person. He starts off as selfish, and I thought he could come across as arrogant at times too. Yes his parent are portrayed in a bad light, however I don't think it was overly bad and helped to explain Chris' want to break free, on his own.<br/><br/>As the story continues he has meaningful relationships which help him to understand that we humans are relational beings, and mostly in life we get the most enjoyment when we can share it with others.<br/><br/>He wants to get back and share his experiences with those he loves, however unfortunately he learns his lesson too late.<br/><br/>At the end of the day we are all human, and make mistakes. This story is one of realizing the mistakes we make, and becoming a better person for it."

","This over-long film has its moments (the cameo by Ben being enjoyable) but breaks down to yet another privileged kid abandoning all his blessings in a self-indulgent quest for finding his true self. Hirsch plays the part very well, no unnecessary facial expressions or gestures. His character even shows maturity with the people he meets – in particular the young girl singer. That maturity does not extend to himself, although there are ample opportunities for him to wake up. As with many run-aways, he decides who's to blame but somehow ends up lumping his sibling in the same pot. Of course, the misery and abandonment he cavalierly leaves behind takes a back seat to his quest for enlightenment. Hal Holbrook steals the show but is just another pawn to be sacrificed along the way. In fact, with the exception of a single experience, ""Super-tramp"" receives nothing but kindness and understanding from everyone he meets, but still he perseveres. The film is too long by about 20 minutes and should have had the entire river canyon sequence and associated scenes as cuttings on the editorial floor. I had the impression there were some religious-reference scenes that were edited out – if so, thank you Mr. Penn. In the end, McCandless's life can be seen as a futile waste, having little or no relevance to anyone – not even himself. Should this film have been made? I think yes, it is a warning."

","For anything based (especially closely) on a true story, there is no getting away from the basics of the story. And for this one, there's no getting away from the fact that McCandless made decisions throughout the narrative so bad most 6-year-olds would do better. I have thought this since the original Backpacker article, and do not understand why anyone cares why this particular person got himself killed in the wilderness. <br/><br/>The movie had a chance to do that regardless and I totally gave it a chance. Films can use the medium to express a different perspective even of topics that you disagree with. In that, Penn and his cohorts totally, totally failed me. It's 100% an L.A. version of what the outdoors is about, repeated encountered with what I can only characterize as the idealized version of hippie/dropout culture; really every scene to me was trite. The narration, overly-digital handwriting, and whole structure (everything, all the way through contemporary pop music every 11 minutes to set the timeframe,) completely ruined it for me and not once did I ever get totally absorbed into the story, and think I was watching anything but a TV movie.<br/><br/>Two stars only because it was executed in a fundamentally workman-like manner, and there was no actually painful acting, mismatched footage, overly visible crew or FX, etc. But it was a close call. Bad show."
"wbellido","2","2","3","3 June 2013"," An 8 are you kidding!?! I give it a 2.
","Last night I finally gave up watching ""Into the Wild"". Sean Penn's take on an individual's search for his own identity seemed to me to be too much of a movie seeking to lay blame on his parents for him running off to do what he wanted to do and pretty much getting by with that for several years. He ultimately died alone, but from what I could glean from it, that's what he wanted to do. I feel like this movie which has an 8 rating on several scales is a cheat, sort of the way ""Dead Poet's Society"" was a cheat. It blames people. I don't care for the blame game. The movie would have been better if it celebrated this young man's choice in leaving society and being happier for the last years of his life. I've read some reviews that say he's a spoiled rich kid, and there is that. He could have chosen to be more altruistic; however you have to love yourself before you can love others. He was looking for that, but chose to die in the wild rather than go back and be altruistic. I didn't see evidence that he ever saw love in our culture. That indicates to me that he didn't love himself either. I've read this is a true tale. He chose to die alone. The film would have been much better if it celebrated his choice and left off the blame game."

Particularly irking is the short time he spends in a hostel where we see the 'real' homeless people wandering around zombie like. Oh no that's not for our Supertramp he's much better than that! I grew to despise his character the longer the film went on and was actually laughing when he realised he had eaten the poisonous plant, oh dear what a shame, never mind.

"Lemniscate433","7","2","3","19 July 2009"," First time seeing Sean Penn direct...
","And man it was pretty good. Though, seeing the temper that Sean Penn went through as an actor, it would have probably been hell as him being the director. I'm kidding. Penn is a great and talented actor that is unarguably going to be remembered in honor of his acting.<br/><br/>This movie was based on a book of the same name by Jon Krakauer. Into the Wild is about a post-graduate kid named Christopher McCandless who after seeing his life being spoiled by his parents, decides to live a dream that he sees in Jack London's books: he wants to go into the wild and live there. And over the course of the whole movie, we are introduced to characters that shape McCandless's life and give him some life lessons.<br/><br/>I really liked all of the scenes of the Alaskan wilderness that was portrayed excellently through stunning cinematography. It was just beautiful to see the scenes and to see it through a large television. And I thought there were some great acting performances. Emile Hirsch acted brilliantly and was very persuasive with all of the scenes he was in. Also, I give a small shout out to Hal Habrook, who came at the end as Ron Franz, a grandfather figure to McCandless. I mean, a lot of actors over the years of film-making that had to act like a wise old man, but Habrook made his performance very likable and very well done.<br/><br/>However, the movie was not entertaining. Before trying to avoid the movie because I said that, keep reading and you will see what I mean. Into the Wild was very contemplative and it was not trying to make the wild look like a fast moving adventure with thrilling in every spot. If it were like that, then that would be entertainment. However, this movie really contemplated the surrounding areas that McCandless went through and showed his interests in those areas. In other terms, the film was slow-moving and was in no rush to get to other scenes. The movie is not meant for adventure entertainment, but more of self-reflection of the meaning of adventure, and for that, the movie deserves even more credit. I think that is what a true adventure movie should do.<br/><br/>My dad told me that the movie was in some parts glamorized. Thinking about it for awhile made me realize that there were glamorized scenes in this movie. Sean Penn made McCandless's adventures seem very easy and there was very few scenes of McCandless suffering the hardships of being away from home. And in order to reprimand the lack of drama, they had to put all the drama in the ending of the film. Alright, this is a spoiler, but I do not think it is one because it is pretty obvious what the ending of the movie is and it should not be a surprise to you. McCandless dies of starvation at the end of the movie and when you see his death, he did not die, he DIED. They really made his death really emotional, using flashbacks, deep music, and just scary images of death. The whole intense tragedy was either for Penn to get the producers to sign to his movie or to just show that McCandless's adventures was truly after all, not worth all the grief and it was a stupid mistake.<br/><br/>However, if you like adventure, then this is a movie for you. Just do not expect a re-make of Indiana Jones from this. I will give this movie a mid 7."
"paulclaassen","3","1","1","5 May 2020"," Oh, whatever...
","Sean Penn did a good job bringing the film to life. However, I have so many issues with this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, helped off course by the stunning landscapes. The dialogue is very poetic, and the performances were good. The extreme close-up photography, though, was a bit nauseating at times.<br/><br/>The film can easily be seen as a celebration of life (albeit a bit extreme!), and to explore and experience the beauty of nature. Nowadays we tend to forget nature actually exists. As for Chris, he did some nonsensical things along the way. Often, he came across as extremely ungrateful, and even selfish. His argument for not needing (any) money was absurd.<br/><br/>There were moments I felt the film was stagnating, and I wanted to push it along. 148 minutes is just way too long for a film like this to sit through, especially also since it is slow moving, and the non-linear narration. So, although it is a very well made film, - and there probably are a few lessons to be learnt here - it simply wasn't entertaining enough.<br/><br/>Based on fact, I'm wondering whether I should actually feel sorry for real-life Chris McCandless, on who's adventures the film is based. He brought what happened to him upon himself. Pure self-indulgence! He didn't think his adventure through properly and didn't plan ahead, and certainly didn't do enough research - typical spoiled brat! Having given his ENTIRE savings to charity tells me he was never planning on returning, and that this was probably a suicide mission.<br/><br/>After more than tow hours and an ending I somehow predicted, I was really glad when it ended."

Hal Holbrook puts in what is probably his best ever roles, and only Hal could have done this so well.<br/><br/>Before really deciding to pan this film, read the book. Take a careful look at what Chris/Alex is really doing here. As I've said this is one more about a rebirth, and not so much escape, after realizing what his father really is. As his sister says, they were out of wedlock children, and the father only made that worse, day in and day out.

","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>It's interesting to see how many reviews, both positive and negative, are basing their rating on what the author thought of the lead character. To me, that is a measure of how powerful the film and the subject matter are. No matter what you think of the protagonist, the film draws you in and provokes a strong emotional response.
The film does a good, but not great, job of showing the events and the emotional impact of the events which drove McCandless away from home. The series of relationships he develops are well done, with well developed characters and real emotional attachments. In the end, as McCandless dies alone, we are reminded of all the times he pushed away those who tried bond with him.
There are some elements which distract from the film. All of Emile Hirsch's little improv bits should have hit the cutting room floor with a heavy thud. He's just not very good at improv. The ""apple of my eye"" bit was embarrassingly cringe-worthy. In addition, Eddie Vedder's sophomoric lyrics make the soundtrack a disaster.
I can understand why so many people are upset about the possibility of other people being led to follow in McCandless' footsteps by glorifying his quest. He was extremely irresponsible and lacking in resourcefulness. Seriously, it never occurred to him that the stream he crossed in the beginning would be impassable in the spring snowmelt? He didn't even bring a map? He could have easily hiked out if he had a map. And in the end, when he couldn't cross the stream, he didn't even try the most obvious next step, simply following the river downstream. If he had, he'd have found a cable crossing less than a mile away.
Despite the flaws, this is a powerful story well told, with many fascinating characters. Hal Holbrook, Christine Keeler, and Vince Vaughn all give outstanding performances. It's well worth watching no matter what your views on the main character."
"classicsoncall","7","1","1","6 November 2017"," ""Is anybody here?""
","I come away from this movie somewhat conflicted, not about the picture itself but of it's principal character, Christopher McCandless. I say that with some reservation as well, because when I was his age and fresh out of college, I spent a lot of time steeped in existentialist thought trying to figure out the meaning of life and how to conduct my own. In McCandless's case, there was also the family dysfunction at work, something that I never had to contend with growing up.<br/><br/>At the heart of the movie, I don't have a lot of problem with Chris's philosophy of ""If you want something in life, reach out and grab it"". The paradox in that statement occurred exactly at the time he was saying those words to guitarist Tracy (Kristen Stewart) who fell hard for Chris at the traveler's camp. She was 'reaching out to grab it' and things weren't going to work out for her in quite the same way. So life has it's way of throwing those kinds of curveballs at you.<br/><br/>No doubt some will find the message of uninhibited freedom and life without constraints to be an appealing one, but in the final analysis, doesn't the mere fact of existence require one to do the prudent thing? Chris McCandless's death was so unnecessary. Chances are, had he gone on to live say, a full five or ten years in the wild, he might have come to an entirely different conclusion about the meaning of his life and how to be a productive citizen of the world. His reading of Tolstoy offered a clue to an acceptable view of happiness - work which may be of some use, rest, nature, books and music. Loneliness didn't seem to be part of that equation."

","I was disappointed that most critiques of Into the Wild have romanticized the story way too much. The highlighted ideas, ranging from going back to nature/the innocence, being true, to abandoning materialism, plus the beautiful scenery gave me all the reasons to watch this movie, which is based on the true story of Chris McCandless. With these expectations in my mind, I could not have anticipated to see a young man, despite his curiosity for the meaning of life, waste himself by indulging in anger and extremes. Yes, the story tells us what led to the anger and we understand his pain. I also acknowledge the positive influence McCandless brought for the people he met on his journey. I am even impressed by his uncommonly high moral standard and his open mind to people living on the edge. But, his stubbornness and insistence to stay in the wild was due to his hatred and the urge to revenge his parents. His ultimate goal of finding the truth was a disguised, if not self-deceit, mission to prove his parents' wrongdoings. The hypocrites or even the society he talked about are not anybody but his parents. The ways he chose to find, to reveal, to use the truth all show that he just wanted to hurt his parents and make them guilty. Connecting to nature is one thing, but subjecting oneself to the wilderness without backup or a well thought plan is another. It is reckless and ignorant no matter how much courage or stamina is involved. It is a disheartening story, and definitely not romantic or poetic, with nothing worth glorification except the beauty of nature. I have a lot of empathy for the protagonist and his family, but find the so-called adventure pointless. In contrast, the subplots manage to be geared to the evolving of mutual growth for the characters, including Chris McCandless himself. It is a pity that the built-up of these growths did not sublime soon enough for him to make a rational choice. I sincerely believe that with his intelligence and sense of justice, Chris McCandless could have led a very meaningful life for himself and for the disadvantageous. I was feeling unusually upset when I saw him so blinded from other alternatives. It felt so sad when I looked at his dad break down. The greatest performance was found towards the end of the movie where William Hurt, who looked calm, stepping out of the house, inside which Mom was setting the table for Thanksgiving (or Christmas?) dinner. First a wide shot showed him looking up the sky. Then a close-up showed his face grimacing in pain with his bloodshot eyes. His whole body was drastically trembling. He was actually trying to stop his tears running down his face when he looked up in the previous wide shot. He tried so hard to repress his sadness but it turned out to be a break down. He fell onto the ground in the yard, sitting there with his tightly clinched fists twitching, and crying in total distress. What a heartbreaking scene The bright side on the whole is that, Chris McCandless eventually forgave his parents and felt love for them – upon his death."

"yris2002","10","4","9","3 April 2009"," A rare pearl: when the word fails to translate emotion
","It's difficult and limiting to review such an emotionally engaging movie: it's a movie that can only be lived and lived again, the viewer just has to let it penetrate into his soul, mind and body. It's a movie that empties you in order to let you be reborn to a new life, at least to a new perception of what life and happiness are, and what has nothing to do with them. The depth and intensity of the experiences lived by Chris, as much extreme as the lands he visits (which provide an ideal and spectacular scenario for them), give evidence of such anxiety of life and truth, which go beyond the mistakes made by the young boy. Chris is, of course, a victim of an age which makes you believe the necessity to pursue the ideal, in an absolute way, never considering the opposite necessity to come to terms with real life, often hostile, misleading, which provides false values of materialistic happiness, but from which escaping is not always the most constructive attitude. However, his escape will prove to be almost therapeutic to him, since only at the very end of his physical, but also spiritual, and very painful, journey, will the young boy be able to understand the preciousness of true human relations, those which make you long for a human being you can share happiness with, as well as any other human feeling. The emotionally powerful soundtrack by Eddie Vedder helps to let the movie enter, gently but inexorably, into the very inner core of your soul, stirring such strong emotion inside, that the viewer finds it difficult to translate it into words. The word, however powerful and deep, fails when trying to rationalize the strong emotional engagement: you just have to allow yourself to be overcome by it and leave words aside, as too limited and limiting. It's one of those movies which really gets under your skin and cannot but alter your vision of life, forever. A pure and rare pearl within the cinematography of this century, and, I would say, of all times."
"bobsgrock","9","4","9","19 June 2008"," An inspirational piece of work.
","Sean Penn, one of the finest actors of this decade, has put together a masterful work filled with incredible images and a touching story that speaks to us all about the basic essentials of life. Into the Wild tells the story of Chris McCandless, a successful college graduate who gives his money away to charity and goes on a journey heading towards the wild, beautiful nature of Alaska. His thinking stems from his home life, which was not that stable as a child. His parents fought constantly, and the alienation he felt from them only drove him to alienate himself from everybody else. He thrives by himself and does survive quite well for awhile. While traveling across the American west, he encounters a married couple of hippies, lovingly played by Brian Dieker and Catherine Keener, a young girl who falls for him, played by the remarkable Kristen Stewart, a corrupt farmer played by Vince Vaughn, and a lonely old man, portrayed by Hal Holbrook in an Oscar-nominated role.<br/><br/>All these people influence Chris and he influences them. Penn paces this just right and constantly moves back and forth between the climax of the journey and the events leading up to it. By the time Chris actually plans to head straight for Alaska, we feel he's seen enough. He feels he hasn't. Chris is a young, idealistic, headstrong young man who wants to follow in the steps of his heroes: authors Tolstoy, London, and Thoreau. He wants to live off the land, alone, with no need to have contact with society, which he basically shuns. Us being society, it is hard at times to agree with him, but we also are drawn to him, as are most other people in the film. We want him to succeed, but just like Chris, we don't quite know what he is looking for out there. It may be peace, or freedom, or maybe simply God. Whatever it is, it's something bigger than himself, and he dies in the process.<br/><br/>Despite this downcast ending, Sean Penn has made a remarkable film. The screenplay goes on a bit too long at times, but the direction is perfect. The cinematography is gorgeous, perfectly capturing the awesome beauty of nature not just in Alaska, but wherever Chris goes. This is a powerful piece of work that is nothing short of inspirational. If there is any film from 2007 you look up, it should be this one. It will motivate you to live life to the fullest and find that, ""Happiness is best when shared."" Just like Chris."

","Into the wild, based on a true story, is a slow paced started masterpiece of a movie which grips you just when you start to doubt if this is anything for you to watch. This happens when Eddie Vedder starts using his incredible voice in the soundtrack, following some great colorful scenes of nature and freedom. From there on the story grips your heart by the root.<br/><br/>What a great soundtrack Eddie Vedder has made for this film! Beautiful peaceful, raw and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch impresses a lot as an actor in this, but some of the supporting actors are really fantastic as well. First of all Hal Holbrook who eats the screen as a charming old guy filled with wisdom and affection for life and humans. But Vince Vaughn, Catherine Keener, William Hurt...<br/><br/>It wouldn't surprise me if Sean Penn is another Clint Eastwood in spe. I hated his acting as a young actor, started respecting him a few years ago. Now this storytelling, the way this filming is put together is pure art. Clever art. Clever film-making.<br/><br/>The way the film reveals the reasons of Chris McCandless runaway is outstanding, as well as the clipping which makes the viewer easily understand how Alex Supertramps trail was found and documented.<br/><br/>The film is so beautifully made, it makes one scared some will follow in Chris McCandless footsteps. Though the story gives a warning.<br/><br/>Chris himself understands the real meaning of life, but too late to get back into the real world. He left a lot of broken hearts, and a lot of sobbing cinema goers.<br/><br/>It's a 10/10 but the first 30 minutes loses one of the stars due, as the film could easily have compelled right from start."
"DeeNine-2","10","4","9","5 April 2008"," Call everything by its proper name
","But don't make a mistake.<br/><br/>The theme of this emotionally wrenching drama (script and direction from Sean Penn, from a best-selling nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer) is not man versus wild, as it was in the works of one of the protagonist's heroes, Jack London. Instead the conflict is between man and society. Chris McCandless has just graduated from college. His parents are proud. His grades are good enough for a top grad school. He's bright, personable. It seems he has everything going for him.<br/><br/>But he's bitter and disappointed. He disrespects his parents and believes that the last thing he wants to do is act out their idea of success. So he gives the $24,000 he has in the bank for grad school to charity and just ups and leaves home. He has some Kerouac-like adventures on the road where as a ""leather tramp"" he meets some ordinary people, some good people, some retro hippies, some Middle American farm workers, some derelicts and a social worker in L.A., a pretty girl, an old man, etc., and then, believing ""you don't need human relationships to be happy,"" it's north to Alaska to live out a dream that might have been dreamt by Thoreau or Jack London.<br/><br/>But we know from the very beginning of the film that Chris McCandless AKA ""Alexander Supertramp"" will die in the Alaskan wilderness at a tender age in 1992. Was his death the result of stupidity regarding the dangers of going ""into the wild"" or was it a result of bad luck or accident? Or was it the indirect result of the hypocritical and mercantile values of his parents and his society to which he overreacted? Or even, was it the indirect result of a kind of youthful bravado that could overtake many a young man? What Chris does is what a renunciant in an Eastern religion might do: he leaves society to live alone in the woods. He renounces society's shallow values and lives as simply as possible. But Chris is not practicing an Eastern religion. He is not an old man near the end of his life looking for moksha. He is under the influence of Thoreau and Jack London, whose books he has read and loved. He wants to test himself against the wild without help from anyone. He wants to prove his manhood to himself without the help of society or society's culture But he is a greenhorn in the Alaskan wilderness whose fate is sealed.<br/><br/>The way that Jon Krakauer and Sean Penn have reconstructed this story (partly from notes and even from some carvings that Chris made, and partly from interviews with people who knew Chris) we see that at one point after some weeks in the wilderness Chris suddenly realizes something profound and moving. He says, referring to the great beauty of life and the world that he is able to see: ""Happiness is only real when it's shared.."" At that point he has learned what he needed to learn from the wilderness and from the people he met in his trek across the country.<br/><br/>The great tragedy of this movie is what then befalls Chris.<br/><br/>The ending is emotionally gut-retching and yet somehow cathartic. To watch such a likable, honest and spiritually advanced young man with such potential seem to throw it all away, carelessly, foolishly, or accidentally, is a human tragedy brilliantly brought to the printed page and to the screen for all of us to share. And in this sharing Chris's life gains new meaning and he becomes a guide and a teacher for all of us.<br/><br/>I know it must have been very difficult for his parents to cooperate in the telling of Chris's story since the story does not show them in a favorable light. Yet the very fact that they helped bring Chris's story to us shows perhaps where Chris got his moral courage. I have no doubt that it was their deep love for their son that moved them to find that emotional courage. This movie gives meaning to Chris's life and shows their love for him, and allows a wide audience to see that he did not die in vain.<br/><br/>I want to congratulate not only Krakauer and Penn but also Emile Hirsch who played the part of Chris McCandless. The role was enormously demanding, the sort of role that an actor may only get once in a lifetime, if he's lucky. And Hirsch played it well. He was charming and witty and very strong of character. What a splendid tribute to the real Chris. And kudos to Hal Holbrook who played Ron Krantz to an emotional tee, deeply sympathetic to both his character and to Chris's, and to the significance of the film itself.<br/><br/>And the rest of the cast was also very good, although Kristen Stewart was a little too pretty for the part of the 16-year-old trailer troubadour, and of course William Hurt could have used a larger role.<br/><br/>The lesson of this story, it seems to me is this: Young people of courage and honor, even though they may make mistakes, even though they may be mistaken at a fundamental level, can, through their valor, teach us all something important. As Chris told Ron Krantz, ""Get off your butt, old man. The core of a man's spirit comes from new experiences."" What he is also saying is: live every moment in a genuine way. And we can see that is what Chris did. A life so lived, although short, may well be the equal of a much longer life lived not so authentically.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","After viewing Into The Wild, I was blown away. Not only was it done well, in every sense of the phrase, but it had something to say.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch was surprisingly good. He was really devoted to the role and that is the essence of acting. The rest of the supporting cast was well cast and put on great performances (ecspecially that of Keener, Holbrook, and Hurt).<br/><br/>The cinematography was masterfully done and I really praise Penn for making this film the way he did. The film really sparks a sense of thought in people that most never think about. I am almost happy that the Oscars snubbed the film because I feel its a movie that doesn't need or want praise. (just as the true life McCandless did not).<br/><br/>I know a lot of people think that McCandless was an ignorant brat. I can understand how some might think this but perhaps him being put in that position is what caused him to do what he did. He realized that he was a spoiled rich kid and realized how unimportant being rich is. Money DOES make people too cautious and if you are too cautious you cant live to your full capacity. People should not let socio-economic status define them. I'm not saying everyone should jump ship and walk to Alaska but people should at least understand what he was trying to do and maybe take a lesson from him.<br/><br/>One other thing that really glued the movie together was Eddie Vedder's soundtrack. Ed, as a young man, had the same views on life that McCandless did. He really poured his soul into the songs and the fact that he can relate with McCandless made him the perfect candidate. At some points during the film, the scene almost complimented the music instead of vice versa.<br/><br/>All in all, and outstanding film and will stay with you long after you hit the eject button."

Short after that he suddenly realizes that you actually need money to buy things and starts working at a farm to earn some of the greenbacks he so much hates.Later he works at Burger King who seem to hire illegal workers since he has no ID whatsoever(he destroyed his ID, driving license and credit cards in the beginning of the movie cos those things are part of civilization).In the movie McCandless is presented as a heroic 23 year old full of philosophy and wisdom adventurer, who cares only about nature and doesn't give a damn about things like money, family, love, society and similar human crap.He hates his family cos his dad got his mom pregnant while he was still married to another woman.He doesn't hate his sister but still doesn't bother to give her a call after being away for over two years.So after this time he finally reaches Alaska and starts living in a junk bus.After some deeper reading of Tolstoi he realizes that coming to Alaska was not a good idea and heads back to the humans. But his way back is cut by a river.So he has to stay in Alaska and starve to death.This movie worships stupidity, irresponsibility and ignorance!In the end of the movie McCandless was so pathetic that even the grizzly bear didn't bother to eat him.<br/><br/>The moral of the story: Even after graduating from college you can still be stupid!!

","Christopher McCandless wants to be a free spirit. He wants to break the shackles of institutionalised education and ambition. Of parent's expectations and society's reliance on definition by what we do. He graduates college, donates all his savings to charity, erases all record of his existence and runs away from home to be in the wild. The justifications for Christopher's journey into the beyond are slowly revealed through flashbacks and memories of his family, through interactions and friendships with a range of colourful characters along the way. He is ultimately selfish, passionate, angry, and frustrated. But he is smart, reflective and free. It appears that he wants to anger those around him to prove himself to them, to prove himself to the natural elements. In this way he is brave and arrogant but he fancies himself a thinker. His actions and adventures end up causing harm to himself and minor setbacks in his journey. Each episode he makes is such that of life  a grand plan carried away into detours where the wind blows. For all this time in the wild he never communicates with family but forms new relationships with complete strangers, who take to Christopher's infectious and vivacious attitude to life. Christopher hopes to derive some meaning to life from getting out there and 'just living' but the land proves to be just as harsh and uncompromising as the rules and standards he faced back home.<br/><br/>The scenery, filmed in the Western U.S states, is very picturesque and expansive, demonstrating an impressive variety of landscapes and lifestyles, yet proving itself a formidable adversary for our hero. As is the case for many ensemble pieces, Christopher's idiosyncratic troupe of hippies, musicians, tourists, nomads, farmers, and fathers form an instrumental role in his spiritual growth and eventual destination. They all help Christopher along on his journey, but he able to teach them a thing or two about living. With his apparent naivety and joie-de-vivre, they form somewhat of a de-facto family to Christopher, and some of the closest relationships he experiences. Christopher affects each of them greatly, from Jan and Rainey's relationship counselling to educating Wayne with his abstract musings on 'living', and to octogenarian Ron who learn to live and be free. While Christopher is clearly alone in the wild, he meets others alone in life. And through his new-age philosophy, he enhances their lives with new found insight and action.<br/><br/>But for all his philosophising and gung-ho attitude to life, I just couldn't accept that he could just leave his parents and sister for dead back home, not even to write or call (even if they tried to find him). To go on a journey with no plan and no money is somewhat foolish, thus his reasoning for the journey. But even if the journey is more important than the destination. What was achieved in the end? Couldn't he have talked through this with his family, his sister? Why only now when surely he had support and friends back home? Martyrdom is an effective device in telling a story but in all reality, it's futile and a waste of life. Call me a pragmatist, a realist, but the fact that he made it out there for 2 years, refused to give up and died for his means is naïve and pointless. <br/><br/>Sean Penn has crafted a strong that has a good heart, but fairly unfocused and lengthy considering many scenes should have been cut. The direction was satisfactory, not stellar and the whole film lags in many places in what could have been a much tighter thrilling story. The abundance of too many erroneous scenes and themes of unrealistic romanticism ultimately fail to convince. Christopher states give me truth over love, money, fame, and fairness. Nice ideals, but I would say get out of the wild, into the real world and wake up."

A delicate balance is somewhat challenging but highly rewarding. <br/><br/>This movie reminded me of my life experiences ,when I was totally alone in nature, by choice, and what was revealed to me by circumstance... life is truly an amazing gift and the greatest gift is in sharing.<br/><br/>Thank you Sean Penn and wish you a continued success in your sharing.<br/><br/>Claude Laniado actor/producer/psychiatrist"
"sackleywhistle","9","4","9","15 November 2007"," A breath-stealing, beautiful film
","Knowing the bare bones of the story of Christopher McCandless, and having seen Sean Penn's debut feature The Indian Runner, I went into Into The Wild with reasonably high expectations. The finished film far exceeded anything I could have hoped for - especially from the mediocre advertisements - to become the very best film I have seen in 2007 so far (previous title holder: Zodiac) and one of the most affecting film experiences of my life.<br/><br/>Having said that, I almost don't want to praise the film too much, as it would raise expectations to a level that might not be met by all viewers. This was, for me, a very personal film to watch. Penn (writing and directing) has created a version of McCandless that transcends mere biography or American travelogue (though it is both) to become a cypher through which I judged my own outlook on life and the actions and choices I make everyday. While it never preaches or takes one stance over any other, it is difficult to look into McCandless' eyes (Emile Hirsch in a career-defining performance) and not see your own soul reflected and questioned.<br/><br/>On a purely visual level, this is an astoundingly good-looking film. Panoramic vistas are juxtaposed with minute details, nothing dwelled on too long, but long enough to give a very real sense of place and environment. Its easy to empathise when Hirsch looks on a herd of animals charging across the mountain-side and tears form in his eyes. You feel the cold, the wet, the warmth and you understand. This marks a huge leap forward for Penn as a director, very quickly establishing a visual short-hand in order to cover so much time and so many events in significant enough detail.<br/><br/>At the same time, he has populated the film with some of the very best character actors working today in order to establish maximum character with minimum screen-time. Perhaps the best example of this is William Hurt, who - while only on screen for several minutes - has one of the most moving moments in the closing minutes of the film, in a single, short shot, devoid of words. Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, the always reliable Marcia Gay Harden and first-timer (according to his IMDb profile) Brian Dierker all turn in touching, pitch-perfect performances.<br/><br/>But the highest plaudits must go to Hal Holbrook and Hirsch himself. Holbrook is guaranteed to make you tearful without being maudlin or overly sentimental (Robin Williams: take note!). While he may look frail, he has lost none of his acting chops and delivers an important counter-point to McCandless' final stages of his journey north to Alaska, as well as a surrogate father figure in place of the parents that McCandless left behind. His role in the film is similar to the moment in The Straight Story when Alvin Straight meets a young, hungry hitch-hiker and tells her about the importance of family. And Holbrook fills it with subtle glances and expressions that say so much more than the words coming from his mouth.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch delivers a performance the likes of which has never been hinted at by his previous roles. In more ways than one, it is a completely naked performance, filled with warmth, charm, fear and fearlessness, determination and vulnerability. It is, in no uncertain terms, an invisible performance, one where you see two people on screen: Christopher Johnson McCandless and Alexander Supertramp, not Emile Hirsch the actor, even when he breaks the fourth wall and looks directly into camera. This is a dangerous technique, but one that, rather than removing the viewer from the experience, pulls you closer to the character looking at you.<br/><br/>In all aspects (including the gorgeous cinematography and Eddie Vedder's score and songs), this is a triumph the likes of which we rarely see in modern cinema. That it stands to be one of the very best, most enduring films of a year that brings us Zodiac, No Country For Old Men, The Assassination of Jesse James and There Will Be Blood is testament to Penn's growth as a filmmaker and his understanding and interpretation of the source material.<br/><br/>While the final 20 minutes are among the most difficult I personally have ever sat through in a cinema (I found it hard to breathe during one particular scene, openly weeping during others) this is a rewarding, potentially life-changing experience and a unique work from a major voice in American cinema. The very definition of ""must-see""."

","INTO THE WILD (2007) **** Emile Hirsch, Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker. Sean Penn puts his heart and soul into this ambitious adaptation of Jon Krakauer's best seller based on the true life account of 22 year old Christopher McCandless (Hirsch in the performance of his career), who decides to shirk society and his family's troubled worlds by heading out into the American heartland with a determination to live off the grid en route to his goal: Alaska. Along the journey he will find some unlikely supporters including a fun-loving employer (Vaughn); a couple of hippies (Keener and Dierker); a possible soul mate (the beguiling Stewart) and a father-figure (Holbrook in an Oscar worthy memorable supporting performance that is a textbook example of fine acting)  all providing insight for the trip ahead. Penn wisely employs the picturesque sights with Eric Gautier's lush cinematography and the dead-on songbook of Eddie Vedder underscoring the beautifully rendered performance by Hirsch making an indelible impression to a heart strong young man whose unique trek in life proved to be his fate."

I have seen this movie twice in theatres already because I couldn't wait for it to go onto DVD when ever that may be. The lessons and ideas of a boy around my age just is amazing. The way McCandless viewed life and the world was amazingly done by Sean Penn. Emile Hirsch has grown in every role he has encountered and should be hitting that $10 million a flick pricetag if he continues to put out movies like this. I hope this is not the peak of his career though this will be VERY hard to top, and he has jumped into my top spot of favorite actors. The cinematography matched that of National Geographic. If you see one movie this year this is it. Might need to see it again."

","I bought this book quite a while ago but never got around to reading it. I was so excited when I heard it was being made into a movie- especially with the help of Jon Krakauer! The movie is so engrossing that the nearly 2 1/2 hours went by very quickly. Christopher clearly was born too late- he epitomizes what we were like in the 60's and 70's- a time of innocence with a quest for simplicity. I really felt like I got to know and understand his character- such a sweet and likable kid. Emile and the rest of the cast did a great job. I will be buying this as soon as it comes out in DVD- and so I can watch it again."
"Cavachee","10","4","9","15 October 2007"," Great movie
","This was truly an incredible movie, and carried many things I've found lacking with recent movies. I only had two real problems with this film; <br/><br/>1. The ending, which over looked the fact that It wasn't the berries that killed him, but mold that grew on them, from being stored in the plastic bag. It's a small detail, but it didn't make much sense to me that he would read the book 'after' he ate the berries.<br/><br/>2. It wasn't playing in any local theaters. With some of the movies that have been coming out lately, it's a real shame that they couldn't fit this into more. Mostly because this movie was by far one of the best I've seen lately, and I wouldn't want people to miss out on it.<br/><br/>So If you haven't seen it yet, It's WELL worth the drive to a theater showing it... And I really didn't spoil that much, considering the book STARTS with his death"
"theycallmephilkbriggs","10","4","9","24 September 2007"," an emotional knock-out!
","A movie that carries so much weight and delivers a climatic chaotic ending to the horrible death of Christopher McCandless. Based on a true story about a young man who decides to leave everything behind to discover himself and the lives he encounters as he goes north to Alaska. Sean Penn directs his finest film to date. The look of the film is absolutely beautiful. Think Hal Ashby directing a Jack London novel. Eddie Vedders voice echoes through the entire score which adds an emotional flair. This movie may be a snooze fest to some but if you can take what the movie gives. You can come out as a better person or maybe look at the world in a better light."

","This is the best movie seen in my life forever<br/><br/>This movie is going to be like a looking for a life to the wild"
"ElMaruecan82","9","3","6","9 February 2019"," ""Happiness is only real when shared.""
","""Into the Wild"" is the inspirational albeit heartbreaking story of a brilliant young man named Christopher McCandless who abandoned the premise of a wealthy existence to follow the footsteps of his hero Jack London and answer the call of the wild. He eventually died of starvation after two years of a journey that ended in Alaska where he spent 110 days in a bus lost in the middle of an ancient mining town named Stampede Trail. The bus is still there with Chris' remaining belongings, his diary and his aura.<br/><br/>It's a sad story but not a tragedy. Chris chose his destiny and gave it its full meaning. He didn't know what he was seeking but knew what he was rejecting, believing the journey mattered more than the destination. Such a story called for a movie and of all directors, it was Sean Penn who adapted the book of writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer, rightfully believing the material would still find a profound echo in people's hearts 15 years after Chris' death. His movie is not only served by a breathtaking cinematography and a haunting performance by Emile Hirsch, it also benefits from a clever editing, ironically the only category to be Oscar-nominated besides Hal Holbrook's supporting performance.<br/><br/>The editing matters because one can't look at Chris' odyssey as something linear, the film opens by swinging back and forth between the ""Magic Bus"" discovery and family flashbacks, respectively the ""beginning of the end"" and ""the end of the beginning"". The non-linear storytelling creates the same startling puzzlement as the people who met Chris the adventurer when they discovered where he came from: a wealthy family with two highly educated parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) who tried to shape his future with their ""present"" as a model. So when we see this young hiker barely accepting a pair of boots before getting in the middle of the wild nowhere, we know something failed in the McCandless' educational project.<br/><br/>The contrast is even more striking as Hirsch suffers from the same cruel syndrome than many young men who, beardless, look ten years younger despite the fact that the stories are set only two years apart. So we can see both the plant of rebellion growing and the roots in Chris' past. And Penn chooses the right way to relate the process, Chris couldn't be the narrator, he's a man of action and his actions speak for his rejections: refusing a car as a gift, gives his entire $24,000 savings to charity, burning money, cutting his credit card, everything that superficially defined him.<br/><br/>So it's through his sister's monologue that we understand what sowed the seeds of his non-conformist: his father's infidelity, domestic violence and the way his parents' materialistic achievements alienated them from their two children and painted a forever disgraceful portrait of success in the mind of Chris (the sister is played by Jena Malone). So Chris expressed his disagreement many times until it was time to walk the walk. So we can clearly see the initial motives and the end of the journey.<br/><br/>And the middle-story is indirectly told by someone who only left behind him a series of encounters with strangers that Krakauer could track in order to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. Chris didn't write anything until he came to the bus because it represented the edge of his adventure, the real challenge he was seeking. During the last two years where he was still looking for himself, he met a couple of hippies (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener) a farmer (Vince Vaughn), a couple of Danish tourists and finally Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz.In every case, something immediately caught their hearts, they shaped his vision but so he did with his genuine sincerity, brave approach to life and optimism. And though Hirsch gave a great performance, bizarrely snubbed, the real Chris looked even more sympathetic.<br/><br/>Speaking from experience, I had my share of friends in business school who were acting like pseudo rebels, rejecting the comfort of modernity, career, family and wealth, only to get back in the ranks once the diploma obtained. Young privileged ones like Chris are numerous but a few of them dare to act according to their thoughts and that's why Chris immediately cuts to our hearts, he's a man of his word. And go figure why, I was thinking of Anne Frank while finishing the film. Maybe it's because I saw the film recently but here are the points of comparisons.<br/><br/>Both died in their youth and became universal symbols of a spirit resisting the pressure of the world and seeking honesty, purity and peace. Both had a diary they couldn't finish. Both depended on the kindness of people and it's a real shame for Franz who couldn't adopt Chris (Holbrook melted my heart in his last scene). Finally, both have universal posthumous legacies and we can only picture them with a smile on their faces. Of course, Anne didn't chose her life but she lived tragedy with her family while Chris lived happiness he couldn't share.<br/><br/>Happiness indeed. Chris' last picture shows him with a smile on his face, looking gaunt like a Concentration Camp survivor but smiling nonetheless. He didn't want to die, he might have expected it when he realized he couldn't get back anywhere and never let enough hints to be found, but his survival journey into the wild made him a model for young people who felt an instant need to discover themselves while discovering the world.<br/><br/>Chris could learn a few things before getting back and coming to terms with his family but he didn't have time to practice what he learned. Still, what he lived taught the world a lesson, a practical one about survival, a universal one about being true to yourself and a timeless one about dreams and happiness, achieving dreams is important but dreaming alone can be dangerous, if not lethal."
"fullbug","1","3","6","27 November 2017"," Confused Rich Kid Commits Self Righteous Act By Throwing His Life Away
","I don't see this as a ""love it or hate it"" type of movie. Like many other crappy movies within the last 10 years, the high ratings and reviews given to this one is obviously the result of IMDb being saturated with paid Hollywood shills. A travesty to what initially was a very good website.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see a story of courage, determination and wilderness survival. Instead what I got was a spoiled rich kid that read a few books (figured he knew it all) and flushed what would have been a blessed life down the toilet. And done so out of some self righteous act against his suburbanite parents.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, the movie is a 2 1/2 hour struggle to watch. There is not even any character development that the viewer can latch onto for any enjoyment. All the characters are very shallow. In fact, there wasn't even very many nature scenes for the cinematography to be complimented. And I'm not a fan of Pearl Jam (or Sean Penn for that matter), so the soundtrack was a pain to stomach as well.<br/><br/>The only redeeming feature for me was the character played by Hal Holbrook...but the kid was too stupid to listen to his sound advice. McCandless reminded me of Timothy Treadwell from The Grizzly Man documentary. Another very confused person with no respect for nature or themselves.<br/><br/>Hard to believe that this waste of time movie is on nearly every list of Best Outdoor Survival Movies. The paid online shills have made a very large footprint in helping to mask the sagging movie industry."
"dirtphelia","3","3","6","30 April 2016"," Just a bad, pretentious movie
","I read the book and of course the movie doesn't compare. Still, starting with the totally wrong choice of main actor (nothing against the guy but he was the wrong choice), going on to the writings on the screen (I love to read, and when I choose to read I read instead of watching a movie), and to the fact that more time was spent romanticizing Chris's life with Eddie Vedder soundtracks than showing, for example, how he connected with the people he met - the whole thing is just annoying and pretentious.<br/><br/>And that point where the actor looks into the camera? That ruined the whole thing. I continued half watching it as background noise while I cleaned my house."
"mike-wright-1","9","3","6","17 December 2012"," An excellent choice for a movie party!
","Most of the negative reviews around Into The Wild focus on two things. The merits or otherwise of Chris McCandless and the accuracy of the story. Whilst I can understand a degree of frustration at the addition of at least one fact to romanticise the story and the man, I feel sad that some people are so judgmental of others that they cannot enjoy what is a truly beautiful and thought provoking film.<br/><br/>At best the protagonist was brave and principled. A voice all too infrequently heard as society careers ever more headlong towards pure materialism. A man who understood that the health of the soul and the clarity of understanding his place was of utmost importance. At worse he was a selfish, ignorant and pretentious brat. A man who was so wrapped up in the tough cards life had dealt him that he unconditionally abandoned the one person who loved him and had been dealt those some cards. A man who failed to recognise that for all the relative pain he had gone through in his adolescence, he also had been given the intelligence and opportunity to really do something with his own life.<br/><br/>This is what makes Into The Wild first and foremost such a satisfying story. It shouldn't matter which side of the fence you fall, so long as you can appreciate the polarising nature of the character. My emotions towards him swung wildly with the narration of his sister and then seeing the positive effect he seemed to have an everyone he met on his travels. I don't judge him for his foolishness; I think life has judged him quite enough for that already.<br/><br/>Of course none of that covers the beautifully captured scenery, pitch perfect soundtrack and wonderful pacing of the film. The two and a half hours flies by despite the episodic nature of the story, thanks to the inter cuts between the magic bus and what led to it. Emile Hirsch does everything he needs to as the lead and the supporting cast fall in behind up wonderfully. Of particular note are William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as the parents and Catherine Keener who maximises every second of screen time in her portrayal of the roaming hippie, haunted by the reminder of her estranged son.<br/><br/>There are few films capable of prompting debate quite like Into The Wild and that is a thoroughly fine trait to have. Plus it's a damn enjoyable watch."
"MaxHoutman","10","3","6","9 October 2012"," Into the wild, a controversial art-house film about searching the truth in life.
","INTO THE WILD.<br/><br/>Into the wild, a controversial art-house film about searching the truth in life. Jon Krakauer's Into The Wild which I read, tells the story of a 20-year-old graduate called Chris McCandlles (Emile Hirsch). Who donates his entire $24,000 savings account to charity. And abandoned his valuables and starts to live into the wild. Director/Actor Sean Penn prepared nearly 10 years before starting to actually shoot the film. Sean Penn's film adaptation stays close to the source. As a director Sean Penn exposes his ability in directing and absorbs the audience into a melodramatic emotional and truthful story.<br/><br/>Into the Wild combines two popular genres, the road trip part where Chris takes distance from the achievement society to search for the real human being. And the struggle of man versus the ruthless nature in Alaska. Into the wild is narrated by Chris his sister called Carine (Jena Malone). Carine expresses the feelings from her brother in contrast with her parents. Chris heads west, and burns all of his identification cards. He is now known by his nickname "" Alexander Supertramp "". While hitchhiking Chris encounters a hippie couple (Catherine Keener, Brian Dierker) and gets in good company. He learns and shares with them, before moving on. By the time Chris is nearly out of his money. He meets Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn) a grain harvester who gets in trouble about his suspicious activities. Chris heads west, his sights now resolutely set on Alaska as his final destination. He re-encounters the hippies and bumps into a young girl (Kristen Stewart). It makes me wonder about the sexuality of Chris. At his last stop Chris is asked to be adopted by a lonely, aging man performed by Hal Holbrook.Chris leaves the request with reference to adoption unspoken as soon as he travels towards Alaska. For Chris It's the journey, not the destination what matters. It's an admirable attitude to life, in what manner Chris creates a fellowship amongst the persons who come across his path while traveling. Every individual who knew Chris understood his notion and loved him. Aimed at Chris, the trip to Alaska is what giving him happiness and pleasure. Chris settled himself into an old coach and survives from what the wilderness dedicates. Emile Hirsch has a very difficult job of taking a character that has been wounded by his parents and the society. Searching for what contents life, but as a result he won't find what he's searching for, because "" Happiness is only real when shared "" as Chris wrote in his diary. The way in which this film is shot is absolutely wonderful, the cinematography represents the story magnificent. In some cases they broke the cinematography rules to provide the look for what it needs, to express emotions, circumstances and the right atmosphere as well as the editing.<br/><br/>Into the wild is a long motion picture, clocking nearly 150 minutes. And is oriented on different subjects which makes it interesting but also exciting for what the next chapter will bring. I definitely learned a lot and I admire Chris in his belief, vision and strength. Emile Hirsch acted blameless even as the supporting actors, with a drowned performance by Hal Holbrook and not to mention director Sean Penn.<br/><br/>Written by Max Houtman"
"Jible","10","3","6","2 February 2011"," the effect the movie had on me
","After watching this movie I felt a strange empty feeling inside. I was sad but first I guess I was more shocked. The most shocking part of this movie is off course the end. It takes me back to couple of years ago. After coming back from three months traveling and sharing all my great experiences with my family and friends, I read a message that a travel-buddy of mine died while on a hiking-trip. I had only known her for a few days, but it hit me hard. This was because I knew that she had died during one of the greatest experiences of her life and wasn't able to finish it or share her experiences with friends & family back home. The movie 'Into the wild' brings me back to the good memories of traveling; the astonishing beauty of nature, the incredible connections you have with random people and the amazing feeling of freedom, but also brings back the bad memory of a friend losing her life while having all these experiences. Although the sadness the movie brings, I am very glad this movie was made and shows how hard reality can be sometimes. It reminded me that I should cherish the feeling of freedom I had during my traveling and remembers me to live life to the fullest. Thank you!"

","Giving the nature of the story the film was going to be very emotional. It's a difficult story indeed but the structure of the film makes it incredibly more effective, I think that's one of the main achievements of Sean Penn here. Since I first knew about INTO THE WILD I really wanted to watch it. The fact that one of my idols, Eddie Vedder, composed the soundtrack was a big plus. <br/><br/>I'm not mentioning the book the film is based on since just right now, and after watching the film last night, I'm realizing about the existence of John Krakauer's bestselling book. I didn't knew much about the film before watching it, I mean I wanted to check it out since it was brand-new but really I didn't read or hear that much about it (and sort of forget about it when every time I went to a DVD store the price of its DVD was still the same, a ridiculously high price). I even doubted in the course of the film if it was based in a real story, I recalled something of that but frankly it was until I saw the real picture of Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch plays, in a superb way, Chris, a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp) when I was a hundred percent sure about that. <br/><br/>Not knowing about Chris I think was a good thing since even since always during the film the destiny of Chris was clear I still wasn't too sure about it. Like I said, I think the structure is essential for the effectiveness of this film. We have two parts: ""Alaska's Magic Bus"" and ""The amazing journey"". You're always extremely interested to find out what's behind and what happens in the ""Alaska's Magic Bus"" part, you want to know the why and the conclusion all the time. I'll give you a quick summary of the beginning of ""The amazing journey"": Chris is finally finishing college, a great achievement for him? Not really as is not important or a matter to be happy about that his parents, Walt (William Hurt) and Billie (Marcia Gay Harden), will buy him a new car since he had success in college. For Chris is time to see where the wild things are. <br/><br/>Once Quentin Tarantino said """", of course in reference to his masterpiece PULP FICTION. While INTO THE WILD is only about Chris' story there are many answers you just want to know immediately, you know more or less how those answers will be but still you want them immediately. Thankfully you feel safe. The storytelling is perfect, it never feels forced when it comes to find out the why <br/><br/>The landscapes are just to enjoy. Story takes you everywhere, and I don't mean that because Chris is in many places but because he experiments so many feelings. People, this is when you know the structure is perfect ruco, for your girlfriend and maybe even for you will be hard not to cry. Best performance Emile has done so far"

I believe he's an excellent actor and I can see his career going from strength to strength. I then began to learn about the true story of Christopher McCandless and his life. I have read articles from those that knew him and from what I have read Sean Penn has portrayed this young mans life down to a tee. The acting, filming, scenery and Eddie Vedders fantastic soundtrack are all amazing but the story itself is what does it. A mans strict refusal to be lured in by the evil in society leads to an epic journey of Self Development, proving that real strength lies within. This film will not only entertain, it will inspire.

"Deveousdevil","10","3","6","14 November 2009"," An Inspirational Adventure
","This was truly a great movie. It chronicles the life of Chris Mccandless based on the book with the same name.<br/><br/>As you watch the movie it's as if you follow Chris in his quest to understand the beauty of the world without being part of the world we know. As it goes on parts of his journal that he kept on his travels are read out and analyzed and attached to the meaning of his quest. It's a beautiful perspective on why we live and how to find true untainted happiness simply by being a part of nature and real life, as opposed to the social conditioning we have become used to.<br/><br/>There are parts that will make you think hard about your own life and how you can make yourself happy. In the end however, Chris is on the verge of starving, and he realizes that ""happiness is only real when shared"". This part nearly brought me to tears. It is an intense moment of self reflection and understanding of one's place in the world. It is in a way a reversal of the initial goal of Chris which is to find happiness away from society, and explains the fact that happiness is in fact created by society.<br/><br/>Sean Penn is a great director. This movie had some of the most beautiful cinematography and landscape scenes I've ever seen. At some points you may be awed by the simple beauty of the earth without even having to understand that this was what Chris wanted.<br/><br/>The acting is magnificent. Emile Hirsch is great, especially towards the end when Chris begins to be paranoid and disillusioned by his hunger. You can feel his joy throughout the movie and understand why he set out on the quest, as well as feel his remorse and pain when he comes to the realization that what he searched for may have been closer than he thought and not in the hills of Alaska or other locations.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie. It is pretty long so you may need to watch it in parts as I did. If you're looking to be inspired and get an additional perspective on the world as well as see some beautiful shots of landscapes, it is definitely worth it."

It didn't matter where he went, there were outstanding scenes to experience and great people along the way.<br/><br/>I have to say that Vince Vaughn really impressed me in this film. This is not the Vince Vaughn that I do not like.<br/><br/>Rather than wait 12 years for a permit, he just took off down the river. If he hadn't he wouldn't have met Sonja and Rads.<br/><br/>Finally, Salton Sea, and Rainey and Jan (Catherine Keener) again; and Tracey (Kristen Stewart). He was a gentleman and saved her for the vampire to come.<br/><br/>A stop on the way to gain wisdom from the great Hal Holbrook, and it's time to go. ""But when you forgive, you love. And when you love, God's light shines through you,"" Knowing people like his parents and the fact that similar things have happened due to their actions regarding their children, makes this story all the more personal. It is one that anyone can gain by seeing over and over.<br/><br/>A magnificent story, great scenery, fascinating people, and a grisly ending.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch was amazing."

","The consensus from the haters of this film was that the main character was crazy or selfish or stupid or whatever, and that the film portrayed him falsely. Well if you watched the movie and came away with that opinion, how exactly did the film mislead you? I felt that though his motives were intriguing, his quest became an obsession to the point of complete ignorance of his affect of the people in his life, past and present. Luckily, the film was descriptive and neutral enough for me to formulate that opinion.<br/><br/>I would worry if all viewers of the movie came away with the same opinion of Alex Supertramp. Then you'd know Penn was serving Kool-aid."

I think that everyone have had or will have an experience like that. It is not necessary to go to Alaska, but wherever is good to find our personal light inside us.

""Sharing happiness"" and ""reconciliation"", kinda like the gospel of the lost child. He didn't succeed in turning back to forgive, his path had a cruel and lonely ending...but probably we find ourselves when we forgive, and once we forgive, we can go back and solve our past.

"callingelvis","Null","3","6","30 December 2007"," I want those 2+ hours back
","When I first read Into the Wild, by Jon Krakauer, about two years ago, I started reading and found myself staying up until far past midnight, unable to put the book down, so enthralled was I with the story of an idiot boy who discarded his former life to travel to Alaska and ultimately die in the bush there. The book was a first class page turner, the type of thing you don't put down until you absolutely have to. I'm sorry to say, the movie was nothing like that. Perhaps it was the fact that I watched it while my eyes were already drooping from the exhaustion of the day, but to put it plainly, this movie was excruciatingly boring.<br/><br/>Basically, what you have is a bunch of clips of Chris McCandless' life, both prior to and during his ill fated Alaska adventure. Sean Penn tries desperately to make the audience feel something, and fails. Why not just present the kid's life and let the audience feel what they will? You can tell Penn thought highly of this lad, and in order to make the viewer share that opinion, included a bunch of scenes tailor-made for Chris to spout platitudes in. You know, deep stuff like ""don't let your life pass you by"". If you've watched the film, you know for yourself how many times he spoke variations on that theme. We see plenty of shots of Chris in the wilderness, lots of slow-mo scenes, and we're also introduced to a cast of supporting characters ranging from a sweet old man who offered to adopt him, to an underaged love interest. When I heard Chris tell the old man that he was just ""sitting on his butt"", I wanted to jump through the screen and punch the kid in the face for being such a pretentious little twit. There he is, some wet behind the ears rich kid, telling an old man who has lived a long life that he should go do something. It was enough to make me gag, but I can't blame Sean Penn for that one, because in real life Chris McCandless was an obnoxious jerk, who thought nothing of disappearing and leaving his parents, who were by no means perfect yet who loved him and did the best they could for him, and his sister, who idolized him, to wonder what happened to him.<br/><br/>I agree with the other reviewers who hated the grating voice-over which seemed to be a lazy substitute for actual storytelling. In the absence of a well thought out script, what else are you supposed to do, I suppose. <br/><br/>There will be those who love this film, I am sure. Every one is entitled to their opinion. For me, though, it was a poorly made, overly long movie about a kid who died in the bush because of his own stupidity and arrogance, a self indulgent piece by Sean Penn, who after this, should henceforth be required to stay in front of the camera."

","I have never seen a movie like this before. Just to be clear, this is a unique amazing movie, but mostly it is the story and the man that makes the movie. One can wonder about the reality of this movie and this man, but something amazing happened in this guy's life in his short 24 years on planet Earth.<br/><br/>Go see the movie before you read the rest of this or any of the mostly idiotic posts always present on IMDb, this movie demands it, and you certainly deserve it. Even if it rubs you the wrong way, it is a very human movie, and a very human experience to watch it.<br/><br/>Christopher McCandless was a puzzle, obviously, at least to us the viewers of this presentation of his life. He has a pull towards confronting nature and reality in the form of nature. Probably his philosophical side, and probably his disappointment in people, the people closest to him, his family, the people who gave him their reality.<br/><br/>Christopher apparently wanted to make his own reality, and this is where I can relate to him as a human being. He got caught. It was too much for him ... just so barely though it looks like. What would he be like today if he had lived? Does the myth and the meaning to the rest of us only have power because he died? He died so alone, and yet he knew love and life and had the courage to live like few people.<br/><br/>Very great movie, all the great contributions from everywhere came together to create a really powerful movie. This kid gets in your head and you share his life with him, he becomes part of all of us ...the part we do not have the guts to live, and the part that led to his demise too, or might have led elsewhere.<br/><br/>The picture of Christopher at the end shows what must have been a really great human being.

"cbrhank","3","5","13","2 December 2007"," A lot of waste here
","It's pitiful to see a wasted life, one that meets opportunity at several junctures but fails to make (and keep) the best choices. Such is the case of Christopher McCandless - a latter day hippie, explorer, and self-exile born perhaps 25 years too late into a modern style failed marriage. Whereas the source material for this film derives from that family's input, one can only imagine the glossing-over their history is seeing here. I have to expect an extensive cache of psychiatric fodder embodied within the whole lot of them. The R-rating is provoked as bait value by some gratuitous nudity and animal-butchery hardly important to this story. There are some filming locations that might have been exploited more extensively for scenic slendor but the director seemed to miss those chances. He was somewhat superficial in this regard while concentrating more on the current style of macro photography. There is little feel-goodness to this movie as the main character does nothing to instruct us about building success in life from where we come. In his case he could have done so much more with his natural tools and schooling. I guess there are plenty of examples of such depressing experiences around and this is but one choice to film. The acting is good, overall, and some of the characters quite interesting in their own right though, except in the case of Hal Holbrook, placed too briefly to be fully appreciated."

","(SPOILER ALERT:I will discuss the end of the film so if you don't want to know, don't read on.) Yesterday I watched Sean Penn's film of INTO THE WILD. This is the story of a college grad named Chris McCandless, who turned his back on civilization and wandered off into the wilds of Alaska. Its based on a book by Jonathan Krakauer who wrote Into Thin Air about a climb up Everest that went all wrong.<br/><br/>I waited a while before posting this because I had to think about it. There is a great deal to love and a central character who was very hard to.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful movie. The marriage of image with the exceptional score is truly amazing.I loved watching the sound and image dance across my TV screen. The problem for me is that once the characters began to talk I couldn't careless. For what ever reason I couldn't connect to McCandless at all. He sounded like a spoiled brat. I don't know if its because McCandless was a twit or because Sean Penn has chosen to portray him as an epic hero for individualism. For me there was nothing he did or said that deserved a two and a half hour movie other than living a life that we could project a sense of longing and lost utopia on to. Clearly it connects with some part of ourselves that connect to Thoreau's Walden the great tale of self reliance (and which apparently is a lie since Thoreau went home every night for a good meal and a warm bed). It was clear to me that he was heading for trouble, and even if I hadn't known how it all came out I probably could have guessed.<br/><br/>Technically I think this is probably one of the best films of last year, but emotionally I don't. I know a good number of people are in love with the film and it's just outside the IMDb top 100, but I'm lost as to why. For me its a beautifully told film that is in its way close to death porn, where the death of the hero somehow makes everything transcendent- or rather is changed into something transcendent so that someone's life has meaning, instead of being a cold lonely painful death all alone somewhere in the wild. For me there was no transcendence only sadness at a life lost."

","While I have to admit enjoying the film as an adventure tail on the whole I found the main character of McCandless totally unlikable. Despite the directors best efforts to portray him as some kind of charming rogue or anti hero. This guy is perhaps the most selfish individual I have seen on film in a long while. He basically walks out on his parents including his sister who loved him to death, he also turns his back on everyone who is kind to him in the film so he can live like a bum for a couple of years and die of starvation in the Alaskan wilderness due to lack of preparation. And some how we are supposed to think this guy is some kind of hero?<br/><br/>No, I'm sorry, I have no sympathy for this kid at all. It's a great tale of adventure and exploration, but a very poor tail of forgiveness and understanding of the mistakes made by others. This brat thought he was better than society, than the rest of Humanity, and it cost him his life because in the state of nature Humans are very small insignificant things. Without our technology, without our culture and working together we are at the total mercy of nature. Humans can survive in nature, but we will never thrive in it. Also I love how this guy despises society, yet is more than happy to use society's tools to help him survive. Guns, knives, oil lamps, and blankets are not a natural state of the environment last time I checked. Watch this film if you like a good yarn about exploring the world, but don't try to emulate this unfortunate fellow, or the unforgiving wilderness will claim another victim."

"dfranzen70","9","3","7","25 June 2008"," Sensational
","Into the Wild is an alternately enthralling and wrenching portrait of a young man who ran from his problems and searched for peace and found paradise and, in turn, anguish and despair. Chris McCandless' journey is a gripping travelogue that's both a cautionary tale and a vicariously exhilarating experience; man, it looked like he had a whale of a good time, but man, did it end badly for him.<br/><br/>First and foremost, what makes Into the Wild work so flawlessly is that even knowing the final outcome doesn't change the overall effect that movie will have on the average moviegoer. Based on McCandless' real story, the movie pulls few punches in how the protagonist is depicted; he's neither a saint nor a sinner, just an idealistic (and not naive), troubled college graduate who feels adrift from literally everything: parents, life, friends.<br/><br/>Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a highly intelligent Emory College grad, the son of a NASA scientist (William Hurt) and an entrepreneur (Marcia Gay Harden). But unlike other privileged young citizens, Chris has no intentions of enjoying the gifts and wealth his family and connections have afforded him. Instead, he gives away his life savings of $24,000, abandons his beat-up Datsun, leaves his family behind (without telling them), and sets of on a trek around the country.<br/><br/>Chris's travels take him literally all over the country, across the midwest (where he runs a grain harvester for Vince Vaughn), to the Rocky Mountains, to the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, even down to Mexico, winding up at his ultimate resting spot: deepest, darkest, remotest Alaska. The story is told in two timelines, one of the present (the time shortly before and after Chris discovers an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness), and one of the past, the events leading up to Chris's Magic Bus time. And the two timelines are brilliantly juxtaposed with each other by director Sean Penn, who doesn't just show us a perfectly linear chronology of how Chris came to be in an abandoned bus; he shows us the story behind the adventurer, the believer, the angel, the tactiturn rebel, the iconoclast.<br/><br/>So what made Chris McCandeless decide to ditch everything and live off the land like some latter-day flower child? I'll explain no further than to say that his upbringing, under the commanding, demanding eyes of his overachieving, arguing parents, played a huge role - but perhaps not the only role. In short, Chris decides he simply does not wish to be part of the rat race; he does not wish to be trapped in a meaningless job working for a meaningless company doing trite, soul-destroying things. He wants to live and learn on his own. And that's where the inspirational aspect of this kicks in. He sets out to accomplish something undefined (i.e., the abstract Find Himself) and winds up absorbing more knowledge through his experiences than most people do through their lonely lives of quiet desperation.<br/><br/>Along the way, Chris meets myriad people, and it's genuinely touching how much of an impact he has on their lives as he passes through. In particular, Catherine Keener plays an aging hippie whose love for her soul mate (Brian Dierker) has begun to fade; the mere presence of the Christ-like Chris magically changes that, for the better. (A lesser film might have had Chris and Jan sleeping together to foment complications in everyone's relationship.) Chris tells everyone he meets that his ultimate goal is to live in the Alaskan wilderness, consequences be damned; everyone tells him not to do it.<br/><br/>The impression we're finally left with of Christopher McCandless is that of a clever, thoughtful, engaging young man who had more demons than a nightmare of Clive Barker dopplegangers. Haunted by his own harrowing childhood, he escaped as literally and figuratively as he could, living by the seat of his pants over thousands of miles of gravel, sand, and asphalt. His motives might have been a bit selfish (he never did try to contact his family, the film tells us), but his heart seemed to be in the right place otherwise. Which made his demise all the harder to bear.<br/><br/>Hal Holbrook, playing a crusty benefactor to Chris in the Arizona desert, earned an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but even stronger accolades are due to Hirsch, who underwent tremendous physical changes just to play Chris McCandless properly. And the final scene, the waning moments of Chris's life, is so vivid and packed with emotion that you almost can't bear to watch, peeking instead through crossed fingers. Hirsch is so excellent in the role that it's a travesty of some magnitude that he wasn't more widely recognized for his grueling, gutty performance. Even more so when you realize the guy later played Speed Racer and previously had been best known for being Judd Hirsch's kid."

","A beautifully filmed and well-acted tragic story of a man's struggle into the wilderness to escape from society. Featuring Sean Penn in the directorial seat, this is the true story of Christopher McCandless who took the name Alexander Supertramp as he hitchhiked across the country to Alaska in the early nineties. The film is over two hours long and a bit lengthy to watch when stuck in the middle but rewardingly good when finished. It is like The Motorcycle Diaries in a sense only without the political stance and the motorcycle and company. Emile Hirsch is a stunning discovery in this brilliant career move. Although opinions on the main character's views vary especially considering the conclusion to his journey, the important thing about this film is that it makes you think about your own humanity and precepts and whether or not life has become more than a game of survival for you.

"Marijndegroot","8","3","7","23 May 2008"," This is a truly great and moving picture about freedom
","I watched this movie at the cinema this week and I was completely sucked into this great story. The director has done a great job for two main reasons. The first is that he tells the story in such a way that the main character as well as his parents and sister are displayed in a just and appropriate manner. I believe it is often attractive, and easy, to make some of the characters to be more rightious. I think Sean Penn has been very brave on this point not to include judgments, either subtle or hard, into this movie. Any judgment is left to the viewer. The second great thing is that Penn moves away from the standard Hollywood way of filming. He does so by portraying things from the viewpoint of an observer that has a very wide scope. Especially at the end of the movie this is displayed in a very beautiful and moving way when the protagonist dies. At that very special point the two qualities that distinguish this movie merge and make the ending of it into an equally transcendent and immanent apotheosis that is neither good nor bad, but indescribably beautiful and completely transparant. True freedom knows no definitions nor boundaries!"
"Buddy-51","8","3","7","17 May 2008"," What is Man's place in Nature?
","Who among us hasn't, at one time or another, dreamed of one day chucking the whole ""corporate rat race/adult responsibility"" thing and moving to an isolated cabin in the woods where we would be free to get in touch with our inner selves and become one with nature? Yet, even though many of us have fantasized about doing such a thing, few of us have had the intestinal fortitude or psychological wherewithal to actually go out and do it. Well, Christopher McCandless actually DID go out and do it - though with sadly tragic results for both the young man and those dearest to him.<br/><br/>At the age of 22, McCandless could have had the life of privilege, comfort and financial success natural to one who had just graduated with honors from a prestigious institution like Emory University (especially one with wealthy parents). Instead, he chose a different path for himself, one that would reject the materialistic values of the world around him and send him on a journey of self-discovery which, despite the best of intentions, would prove fatal to him in the long run. Over a two-year period, from 1990 to 1992, Chris traveled all across North America - on foot, by kayak, by bumming rides off strangers - finally ending up in the wilderness of Alaska where he was to meet his tragic fate. Along the way, he encountered numerous colorful characters who made a mark on his heart. This adventure was popularized in the best-selling book ""Into the Wild"" by Jon Krakauer, who reconstructed McCandless' experiences largely from notes and journal entries left behind by the young man and through interviews with certain key players in the drama.<br/><br/>For the movie version, writer/director Sean Penn has made Chris' devoted sister, Carine, the narrator and chief commentator on the action. It is through her reflections that we come to understand some of the reasoning behind Chris' remarkable willingness to forego all the creature comforts of the modern world that the rest of us seem to cling to so tenaciously. As with any tale of a picaresque nature, ""Into the Wild"" is more a series of vignettes than a fully fleshed-out drama, and, thus, it has an occasional tendency to ramble and wander aimlessly. Yet, its narrative looseness is clearly a large part of the story's charm. Moreover, Penn keeps it tightly knit together through the narration, the use of flashbacks, the scenes involving Chris' parents, and the mesmerizing fluidity of the camera-work. And, naturally, the evocative, richly variegated landscapes against which the story unfolds play a crucial role in the overall richness of the film.<br/><br/>Some have charged the movie with romanticizing and glorifying an individual who was arguably sociopathic and whose actions and decisions ultimately led to his own death. Yet, while Penn clearly wants us to identify with Chris' sense of idealism and carpe diem spirit, the filmmaker also acknowledges that there are some serious psychological issues at play here, mostly brought on by the young man's being raised by two obviously dysfunctional parents. Yet, the movie is also about how important it is for us to forgive those who have wronged us and to not allow bitterness to determine the course of our lives.<br/><br/>With his boyish looks and unprepossessing manner, Emile Hirsch embodies the devil-may-care spirit of what is, essentially, a 20th Century version of Henry David Thoreau. In relatively small but crucial roles, William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden leave an indelible mark as Chris's parents. The many individuals he meets along the way are embodied by Brian H. Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, and, most memorably, Hal Holbrook, heartbreaking in his Oscar-nominated performance as an old desert-dweller who offers to adopt Chris as his son.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Into the Wild"" can be read as much as a cautionary tale as one championing the cause of unbridled individuality. Like ""Grizzly Man,"" it shows how an obsession with nature and an unrealistic disdain for civilization can lead to disastrous consequences for individuals unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of the natural world. If anything, both films serve as a call for reasonableness and balance in determining mankind's proper place in the overall scheme of things."

Itseemed everything was going great for him, graduated with good grades,had a nice home, and was going to become a big success. But that lifestyle wasn't for Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch). He wanted to escape. He wanted to escape from his family, all of the world's problems and most of all society.<br/><br/>It was summer time, and Chris went out for a drive. He parked the car at a beach and fell asleep. During high tide the ocean totaled his car, but Chris safely escaped. He saw this as an opportunity to just leave. He chose to go traveling alone into the world, and leaving his family behind.<br/><br/>His sister, Carine (Jena Malone), understood why he would leave. Throughout their childhood they've seen their parents always yelling and arguing. Chris usually had different opinions than those of his father, Walt (William Hurt), which always led to an argument, while his mother, Billie (Marcia Gay Harden), would pretend she had a perfect family. His whole family was worried about Chris's whereabouts, but only Carine understood what he was going through, and why he did it.<br/><br/>Chris's main goal is to travel to Alaska; so that he can live life the way it was meant to be, out in the wild, not thinking about bills or taxes. On his epic journey, under the name Alexander Supertramp, Chris encounters many different people. First he meets two hippies, Rainey (Brian H. Dierker) and Jan (Catherine Keener), that he really bonds with. He also meets, and works for Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn). Shortly after Wayne is sent to jail, and Chris decides to back to traveling. He meets some foreigners while rafting, but has to leave after a couple minutes, because of the rafting police chasing him. He then once again meets up with Rainey and Jan, he also meets a young girl that was usually with them, named Tracy Tatro (Kristen Stewart). Chris once again leaves them, and meets the last person he gets to really know before Alaska, and old man named Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). Chris becomes Franz's unofficial adopted grandson. But after a while Chris finally heads for Alaska.<br/><br/>When in Alaska Chris finds an abandoned bus. He lives in the bus, and at first has a blast living off the land. He goes around climbing things and running around, and has the time of his life. Later on, Chris runs out of animals to eat, and has to turn to eating plants. After making a fatal accident, and eating the wrong plant, Chris starves to death.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is based on a true story. There really was a man brave enough to go out into the wild, and lived life the way he believed was best. The movie was written based on what the true adventurer wrote in his book.<br/><br/>This movie tells the great story of a brave man. A man who sacrificed his life, to live life to what he considered, the fullest. The world would be a much better place if people were as determined as him, and had his mindset.<br/><br/>3 out of 4 stars"

"bandw","10","3","7","23 December 2007"," Why this is worth seeing
","I read Krakauer's book several years ago and was taken by Chris McCandless' story and by trying to understand him. This movie helped with the latter - images can sharpen the imagination. It needs to be kept in mind that both Krakauer and Penn are presenting us with attempts at biography that are necessarily filtered through their life experiences. By his own admission Krakauer, being an outdoors-man and mountaineer, could see elements of himself in McCandless and I think the film reflects a deep feeling for the young man on Penn's part. The opinions I have about McCandless are thus third-hand and filtered through the lens of my own experience.<br/><br/>What makes the McCandless story worthy of attention? It's really not the story, but the man that is the attractor. The story is simple enough - young man becomes alienated by his environment and seeks freedom in adventure. Unless you are quite unusual as a young person you must have had, or have, similar impulses for some adventure. That is an immediate bond most people will feel with him. But most of us don't have the drive or personality to act on these impulses so dramatically. However, McCandless was such an impulsive, romantic, idealist that it appears he could *not* act on these impulses, impulses of long standing for him.<br/><br/>It was quite a feat for Krakauer to have tracked down the details of McCandless' journey, and Penn has transformed his book into an excellent film. Little disputed is that McCandless was charismatic; pretty much everyone he met recognized some special spark in him. That is one thing that sets him apart from your average vagabond, he was no crazed nut case. As shown in the movie he was somewhat of an accomplished pianist and you can't fake that. For me Emile Hirsch captured a personal attractiveness in a way that I got only a secondhand feeling for in the book. <br/><br/>Also often remarked on was how intelligent McCandless was, and not just his being well educated. He had a vision that people recognized as setting him apart, a vision of his relationship with nature and what it means to be really alive. I thought the nature photography in the film gave us more than a hint as to what McCandless saw in nature that so appealed to him.<br/><br/>Most interesting are considerations of the complicated psychology of the man. What would make a charismatic, well educated, physically attractive young man veer off from a future that his society almost ordained he live out? Therein lies the mystery that makes this tale compelling. <br/><br/>McCandless' spirit was more in line with Thoreau and Muir than with Kesey or Kerouac. His seeking was more internalized and personal. However, it is interesting that he referred to the day of his coming upon the bus in the wilderness as ""Magic Bus Day."" He must have been familiar with Kesey's quest and was, in his own way, in pursuit of going ""further."" My perception of him is that he was wanting to strip life down to its bare essentials, to get down to the very core of what it means to be alive. It is difficult not to admire that.<br/><br/>Some say McCandless did not die of starvation but rather of stupidity. I think such a statement represents a misunderstanding. He died from an overzealous, perhaps naive, sense of adventure and a vision of how life should be lived. He made it for over three months in primitive conditions. How many people could do that? Albeit most people do not want to, but does that mean McCandless' achievement is to be disparaged rather than wondered at? Absent a couple of naive misjudgments, he would have returned with one heck of a story to tell, complete with lessons learned. And is not his youthful naivety the very thing that makes him such a fascinating character? If this had been a story about a person who did things the *right* way - by studying survival books, buying all of the recommended equipment, carrying maps and compass, studying the trails, planning for emergencies, making experimental shorter trips, telling people of his plans and expected locations - it would not have been a story to capture the imagination. McCandless had the temperament of an artist, not that of an engineer.<br/><br/>There are some very fine performances here. Besides Hirsch, Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker, as an aging hippie couple still living the life, are notable. Hal Holbrook is a standout as an older man who takes a deep liking to McCandless and is about the last person to be with him before he embarked on his great Alaskan adventure. If Holbrook does not get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, then there is no justice. <br/><br/>Mysteries remain about Chris. The life force so manifest in him did not seem to express itself sexually, perhaps it was sublimated in some way? And, even though he loved his sister, he did not communicate with her during his journey. He was estranged from his parents, so maybe he felt any communication with his sister would lead to his parents hunting him down? And his charm and ability to be sociable and enjoy people seemed to be at odds with his desire to be alone. <br/><br/>McCandless' life is a challenge to all security-seeking, timid, spiritless souls who have never had the courage to ignore social conventions to live life on their own terms. Indeed, never to be fully alive in pursuing a personal passion. When he starved to death in that old bus it was not only a personal tragedy, but also the loss of a person who could have made a significant contribution.<br/><br/>So, why is this movie worth seeing? McCandless' trip ""Into the Wild"" can serve as a metaphor for us all to take such a trip - there are many ways to go into the wild."
"kreuss82","10","3","7","14 December 2007"," Just my opinion...
","In my opinion. For whatever reason Chris felt that relying on possessions was a weakness. I will not digress on that subject because it is for each person to understand in there own way. Chris chose to live his life almost completely free of relying on objects that in theory are useless to finding happiness and being content with life. This does not mean those who do not live this life are wrong, but instead just shows that the human spirit, body, and mind are the true source of fulfillment in life. This story is a beautiful inspiration on how life can be perceived. Chris' journey INTO THE WILD was so, physically and emotionally and he stretched his limits past all typical boundaries and then some. I applaud his commitment and will. The book was profound and the movie was excellent!"
"rascal67","6","3","7","1 December 2007"," Too Much Penn - Not Enough McCandless
","Having not read the book, I can only take from Chris McCandless's experiences based on what I saw in the film 'Into The Wild'.<br/><br/>As a film I found many extraordinary things about it. The splendid cinematography is the first that comes to mind; many of the performances–particularly Hal Holbrook–who was a stand out and the interesting story/screenplay that director Sean Penn had to work with, which he painted over a broad canvas.<br/><br/>I do have some issues with the way it was presented. The narration by McCandless's sister; the passages that flashed across the screen from Chris's letters to Wayne who we really didn't get to know much about in the film and the non linear representation of the story—these things were too distracting for me too get fully immersed in the proceedings. It took me almost a restless hour before I began to settle in and my mind was constantly reminded that I was watching a movie. I feel this is due to Penn's disordered screenplay and self conscious directing style—the actor mugging into the camera??? Being aware of who the director was, I feel that more of Sean Penn's sensibilities and politics came through rather than that of the lead character and has let the film down slightly.<br/><br/>The choice of Eddie Vedder to score some of the music and songs throughout the film and the structure of the screenplay appears to come more from Penn's own psyche rather than what could have worked better for the films narrative. I personally feel a more linear/mainstream structure to this film would have benefited the story more. The representation of the themes expressed don't appear tempered or balanced enough—too anti this and anti that. Again it felt like too much Penn coming through.<br/><br/>William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden had thankless roles as McCandless's parents and were wasted screen time. Any other lesser known actors could have portrayed these roles with what little they were given to do; as was with Vince Vaughn's character. Catherine Keener was perfect along with Hal Holbrook and I didn't have any issue with young Emile Hirsch in the lead role. <br/><br/>Through the events portrayed in the film I admire McCandless's tenacity and passion for pursuing the life and dream he desired. However, I found him arrogant and deluded not to mention hypocritical in denouncing the so called civilized world into which he was born. Alright! Chris had some childhood/upbringing issues but who doesn't. He was educated; intelligent and loved; but many of his actions— particularly those involving his family appear selfish. After the distressing incident with the Moose, Chistopher McCandless should have surrendered his ego and made an attempt to turn back home. To my mind he is not a hero and does not deserve to be martyred. It was a shame how this bright young mans life ended up - but perhaps his fate was deserved."
"badasspussywup","10","3","7","28 November 2007"," One of the greatest movies ever about life
","Supertramp - are you Jesus? Into the Wild is based on Jon Krakauer's biography about Chris ""Supertramp"" McCandless - a well-educated young man who dropped-out of society to go on a voyage of self-discovery around America circa. 1990. The film plays like a road movie and Chris encounters a wonderful mix of characters on the way, while making observations of rare profundity about the meaning of life. Beautifully shot, and full of wonderful epiphanies. Go see this on the big screen as soon as possible. To everyone involved: BRAVO!

"dglink","9","3","7","12 November 2007"," A Selfish Quest for Truth
","Sean Penn's film ""Into the Wild"" was based on true events and will haunt viewers long after the final credits fade to black. A recent college graduate, disillusioned by his parents' materialism and duplicity, Christopher McCandless heads off on a meandering journey with the goal of eventually reaching Alaska. Once he has ""disappeared"" by abandoning his car, burning his money, and erasing his identity, the young man wanders the American west in search of himself. The ensuing road movie details the various encounters that he has over the months and years of his journey of discovery. Although Christopher has lost faith in human relationships, he meets and seemingly bonds with a number of people, all of whom take to the engaging, often charming, young man and try to help him. However, he unsentimentally severs his bonds with each, although they apparently have developed feelings and care for him. Rejecting friendship, Christopher seemingly has no romantic feelings or sexual desires either, and he rejects the one overture that is explicitly made.<br/><br/>McCandless's wanderings eventually take him to the Alaskan wilderness where he takes shelter in an abandoned bus and manages to survive on fish and game. The film flashes back and forth between his time in the bus and earlier episodes. The words of his diary are quoted throughout the film, and his eventual realization that there is little joy in life without sharing it with someone comes too late. Emile Hirsch fills the physically demanding role of Christopher and plays it exceptionally well. Among the people Christopher encounters, Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook stand out as a mature earth mother and a lonely widower, respectively.<br/><br/>""Into the Wild"" was made with the cooperation of the McCandless family, who were brave to have exposed themselves and their feelings so publicly. Well played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden, the parents emerge as typical appearance-obsessed Americans who cannot understand their son and mourn and grieve at his alienation and absence. They are not villains, and the son's actions wreak more pain on his family than they ever deserved or inflicted on him. In fact, the young man leaves much pain behind him in his ultimately selfish journey. Not only do his parents and sister suffer, but a young girl, an old retired widower, and a generous middle-aged hippie couple all fall victim to his charms and eventual abandonment. Although Christopher seems convinced that he is on a noble quest, there is nothing noble about inflicting unwarranted pain on those who love you. The words of his final realization and the images that end the film will be etched indelibly in viewers' minds. With both the screenplay and direction to his credit, Sean Penn has fashioned an outstanding adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book and has moved beyond ""promising"" to ""accomplished"" status in both roles."
"jefftjones-1","9","3","7","22 October 2007"," Truly excellent film.
","Rarely upon viewing motion pictures based on trues stories/books, etc. do I come into the process with high anticipation. More often than not I've found myself leaving the cinema morose and let down by yet another Hollywood director who has chosen to glamorize the story for his own ego ignoring the facts and the truth that needs no help on its own. This film, however, is different. Seasoned, veteran actors, such as John Hurt and Hal Holbrook, who might not normally lend their talents to a movie released on a smaller scale such as this, remarkably excel in their roles. Marcia Gay Harden relishes her role as McCandless's mother and it shows. The numerous backdrops where Chris ""resided"" on his journey are breathtaking, and the screenplay by the great Sean Penn left me with a lump in my throat more than a few times throughout the film. You owe it to yourself to see this picture. Moreover, read the book first for the exact insight into Chris's adventure, by Jon Krakauer, and then see the movie. I dare you to leave without swallowing a few lumps."

I think it takes courage to see a movie like this. Be warned, this is not your typical Hollywood big budget formulaic movie. I will be thinking about this movie for a long time.

This movie wanted me to embrace the world in a way that EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL.

"marc-choquette","9","3","7","17 October 2007"," Reality-altering
","""Into the Wild"" is one of the few films that can alter one's perception of reality long after one has exited the theatre. The tale is not so much depressing as it is encouraging; not so much the tale of a thickheaded pariah but one of a modern day Jesus (McCandless was even asked if he was Jesus on his journey).<br/><br/>While some who read Jon Krakauer's bestseller deemed the youth a foolish outcast who needlessly lost his life because of a reckless overdose in idealism, the film paints his journey in a different, more thought-provoking light  seemingly the core of writer/director/producer Sean Penn's focus in making the film.<br/><br/>Penn seemed to adapt the movie not simply verbatim from the novel, but by cherry picking some of the most appropriate passages of the book to highlight larger considerations of humanity's true place in modern society. It is much less a chronological tale of a young man's journey to Alaska as it is a film that appeals to some of our deepest fears and questions.<br/><br/>This redefining foray into life's big questions is why Into the Wild is a must-see, a film that not only tells a lot about the human psyche and our suppressed instincts, but puts it all in a context of a complete rejection of the overwhelming nature of modern society."

","Amazing movie! I was able to identify with the character very much so. I also took a trip to Asia of 7 months to lose myself backpacking there. I also met so many backpackers who took a different direction and chose to take risks and get lost in the perils of Asia. I loved this guy's idealism and love for freedom. We are not free at all. Living in a society with so many restrictions and rules just makes us forget who we really are and what our purpose on earth really is. I admire his guts, courage and idealism. However it is sad that he took his freedom to the ultimate level and die alone in the wild. That is so sad and very immature of him. Maybe he was actually looking for the end, the ultimate freedom and peace. Many people believe he was mentally ill, but I do not believe that. I think he was striving for ultimate freedom and in today's world it is impossible to achieve. Maybe he was just too smart fro us to understand. I hope wherever he is now, he found ultimate freedom and happiness that he was looking for.<br/><br/>The movie was excellent and very well done. Amazing scenery! Bravo Mr. Penn!"

","Any basic literature course will teach you that all great literature focus on a central conflict, either: 1) Man against Man 2) Man against himself 3) Man against Nature It is the rare bird which comes along once in a while which encompasses all three and ""Into the Wild"" does just that.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have asserted that Christopher McCandeless was a naive, idealistic loony who lost it in the wilds of Alasaka. In actuality, he was someone running away from the demons of his family life and trying to find himself in the process. In order to do that, he rejected the affluent life of comfort which was there for the taking (stellar athlete and student, new car, Harvard Law etc.) and instead hobo'ed his way across America, picking up menial jobs here and there and befriending other marginal types on his road to self-discovery which eventually leads him to an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness.<br/><br/>I won't say anymore about the plot, but this film is so much more than a film, it's a meditation on existence and on what we label ""normal"", there is wisdom especially in the the words of Mr. Franz. The is love, there is pain, there is family, there is The Journey. There is also an honest and brutal questioning. In short, the film touches on all the most important aspects of life. Please do yourself a favor and see this film on the large screen, the cinematography is flawless and the real America (or what's left of it) shows off her truest most beautiful self here.

","This film is the portrayal of the life of a troubled young man, haunted by the thoughts and words of authors past and how their thoughts create within him, an inability to form meaningful relationships. Based on a fascinating true story, Penn nevertheless finds a way to destroy it. The real life subject, Chistopher McCandless, a recent college grad, sets out to ""find himself"" but in doing so, thoroughly and completely - and I do mean completely - destroys every prior relationship in his life. In the film he is portrayed as a Christ-like healer, saving the emotional and spiritual lives of everyone with whom he comes in contact despite the fact he remains aloof from them all and refuses to share his past with any of them. The closest he comes to any thing resembling a meaningful relationship is his implied sexual dalliance with his Oedipal Hippy Mom via which he totally destroys her relationship with her Hippy dude. Despite this, the film continuously portrays him in some sort of Messianic glow along with his Hippy benefactors who despite having no visible means of support, manage to own, maintain and fuel an RV as well as feed him for weeks at a time. And in typical liberal Hollywood fashion, Mc Candless' parents are economically successful upper middle class white college grads and therefore evil. They are featured as the exclusive source of all the young man's troubles with no consideration given to the possibility that he might have his own psychopathology. The film is well acted. The story is incredible. But the direction is plodding, slow and predictable. Full on, full steam Hollywood liberalism all the way: Bad parents. Christ-like abused kid sets out to find himself and saves everyone he meets along the way. Meh."

","Into the Wild is a true story of Christopher Johnson McCandless aka Alexander Supertramp aka Chris, who, after his graduation, went on to live into the icy jungle of Alaska (inspired by Thoreau's Walden), leaving everything behind, including his family and all his money.<br/><br/>Director Sean Penn doesn't just show Chris' life in Alaska but his college life and the core reason of why he had this way figured out in chapter wise storytelling which adds interest and structure to the movie. Being a nature oriented cinematography, the visuals of trees, mountains, rivers, free birds are obvious but these images make powerful impact in the movie, especially when Chris looks at the mountains. <br/><br/>Casting is good. Emily Hirsch is perfect for the role, young, full of attitude and firm on his opinion. William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone played a good role as Chris' family. Kristen Stewart was beauty and sparkling as a young girl and even for a short duration, she added happiness in the movie. But, what took the movie to a greater level is the performance of Hal Holbrook as Ron. He just nailed it. A retired military old man, rich in experience and philosophy who connects easily with Chris and becomes a family bond.<br/><br/>Movie is in good pace and tells us clearly how Chris' parents fought over the years, forcing Chris to live secluded. His love for books by Leo Tolstoy and Thoreau shaped his radical ideas and love for the nature and rebellious thinking. <br/><br/>Scenes of Chris diving into the river, adventurously sailing with his kayak into the flood river, walking into the Alaskan beauty mountains, running behind horses in open field and hitting the road symbolizing the ultimate freedom are shown beautifully, making you want to live like this.<br/><br/>What makes Into the Wild a magical experience is the Eddie Vedder's music. Songs are just class. Perfectly in harmony with the scenario of natural living and happiness, these songs take you close to Chris' living. 'Such is the way of the world', 'No ceiling' are real pleasant to hear and 'Society' is as painful as the reality of life. The movie is easily a memorable experience and in my favorite list of movies. The quotes of Chris about career, life, nature are deep and it questions are lifestyle. If you are wise, you will understand somewhere we are wrong and lost as a civilization. Hats off to Chris!"

","It's a difficult to task to bring a true story to film and do justice to it. It's even harder when the main character, around whom the entire film revolves, isn't around to help out. Even so, if the filmmakers keep in mind the character's actions and movement through the various phases of the narrative, the story can come out both coherent and true to the existing knowledge of the person's life.<br/><br/>In the case of ""Into the Wild"" the film was unfortunately made in such a way as to overpower notions of the life of Chris McCandless by excesses in the making of the film. The slow- motion scene of Chris almost falling into a river might make sense to someone who has read the book but it just hangs around in the middle of the movie. The hand-held motions and quick zooms during the self-detox scene tend to obscure what's going on more than to tell the story. All throughout, the mood music is to monotonous. I have an understanding of the use of leitmotif, but this isn't the case here. It's just the same music used throughout the nearly two and a half hours of this movie.<br/><br/>The performances are reasonably good, but the depictions of Chris's family back home are overwrought snippets that are emotionally detached for the viewer. I felt I was seeing outtakes of a drama workshop, rather than a professionally made film.<br/><br/>This film could be interesting. It's an interesting topic and even more poignant because it's essentially true. I can't complain that the movie took liberties, because it didn't. It's failure is that the film makers worked too hard to make things interesting and their efforts are only distracting."

Reversely, seeing this movie through the prism of cold heart and common sense, through the eyes of a father rather than the ones of a son, it's just a movie of another wasted young life, no more than a ""narcotic journey"".....

","I've never seen a movie quite like this one, not an American movie at any rate. The one that comes closest, maybe, is ""Easy Rider,"" but that one was full of plot points and ambition, raggedy though they turned out. ""Into the Wild"" is more like an assemblage of episodes from a self-made movie, put together with the help of some family friends who happen to be professional actors.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is the non-fictional Chris McCandless who gives away everything he owns, takes to the road, and winds up owning nothing in the Alaskan wilderness, not even the opportunity to savor the emotional fulfillment of being completely and utterly alone.<br/><br/>Hirsch isn't bad either. He is transformed from chubby and cheerful at the start to thin and desperate by the end. I would guess the film sticks pretty closely to its origins, which I think I remember reading in The New Yorker years ago.<br/><br/>The narration is based on Chris's sister's memories and on Chris's own journal but narrations can be misleading or sometimes plain wrong. It seems to be all the fault of McCandless's bickering parents. It was they who drove him to these peregrinations. Well -- that's kind of an easy way out. It provides a satisfying explanation for a story that is likely to be otherwise unexplainable, at least until we know more about neurology. It's always easy to find a trigger for behavior in our past experiences. Psychoanalysis rode that horse for generations. In reality I suspect that strangeness in people is partly a given at birth, and the explanations are post hoc and fitted to the cultural climate. It's tough enough being the parent of an odd child without being blamed for every odd thing he does.<br/><br/>Where was I? I think I started out for the Sea of Cortez and found myself, like Chris, in the North Woods.<br/><br/>The photography is sometimes stunning, often appealing, and sometimes as idiosyncratic as Ray Bolger's dance in ""The Wizard of Oz."" Step motion, slow motion, negative shots, all are employed but not, thank God, to the point of nausea. The whole film is leisurely, moving back and forth from Chris's encounters at home and on the road, to the Magic Bus he lives in at the top of the world.<br/><br/>Good actors. Nobody in the movie flubs it. Catherine Keener and William Hurt are exceptional performers but they have little to do on screen. Hurt does get a chance to register some convincing abject anguish at the end. Hal Holbrook, now an older man, has never been quite as good as he is here. A home run for Holbrook.<br/><br/>Does the movie have a point? Well, it certainly tries to impose one on the narrative, something along the lines of spiritual fulfillment is worth any price, even life itself. Hirsch dies with an open smile on his face, gazing at opalescent clouds. (If I remember correctly, the real Chris assumed his absence would be noticed and was waiting for an expected helicopter rescue.) The fuzzy points I would take away don't include our need for others in any but a mechanical sense. (We need others to make our shoes and guns.) There have been successful hermits before. I certainly wouldn't conclude from this story that nature is cruel because it isn't. It's just indifferent. What are we, after all, except a widespread large mammal that happens to call itself Homo sapiens?"

","Into the Wild is an inspiring film that really makes you question society and alternative ways of living. The story's main character, Chris McCandless, is a college graduate who after reading the work of some of his favorite authors such as Jack London; he decides all he wants is to escape from society. Chris McCandless' goal is to go to Alaska and live off the land, self sufficiently, and get away from the conformities and complexities of society. Without a word to his family McCandless leaves his previous life behind and journeys across America, hitch hiking where ever he may feel to go. He even throws away his parent given name Chris for his own pseudonym Alex, which he is known by to his new acquaintances. Along the way McCandless experiences his new hermit style of life and write downs everything in his journal. Meeting new people and learning new things, McCandless spreads his philosophical idea to everyone he meets on his journey to Alaska where hisdestiny is fulfilled. The part that I enjoy most about this movie is the new ideas and concepts it brings up, making you question the faults of our society. I also like the mystery of the adventure, never knowing what's going to happen to the young traveler next. A disappointment to me was the foolishness of the main character. He threw away his college education and left disregarding his family and past life. His act of leaving was ultimately a selfish one; he thought only of himself and not of anybody he once knew or met along the way. To give it a rating out of 10, I would give this film a 5. It was very entertaining for a true story that stuck mostly to the facts without adding excitement."
"Roman-Nies","8","2","4","17 August 2008"," The end of an idealist
","Glorious or inglorious, that is here the question. Alex Supertramp is a down-shifter par excellence, who still needs at first the non-down-shifters for his gradual self-realization. He is an adventurer and freedom-seeker and he is not satisfied with little. He resigns materialism, the urges and lies of the American society and tries to break out into the wild nature, to experience ""real"" life. To late it dawns upon him that nature is no garden Eden and that some attainments, not so much of the civilization, rather of the socialization are reasonable. It is a surprising end that Krakauer describes with the help of the diary of the unfortunate. The movie is here not so much stringent. The end of Alex is cruel and shows that it is vain to romanticize nature. Unfortunate could be the wrong word. If Alex would not have renounced such reasonable artifacts like a map, which he intentionally left back, or at least if he had informed about the locality, he could have made it easily to survive. That he wanted it is shown clearly by his desperate struggle against death. Experienced adventurers always calculate with emergency cases when they plan their special tours. Idealism needs carbohydrates! Alex was sheepish, overambitious maybe simply silly. Yes, exaggerated idealism is sometimes nothing else than density. But it would be wrong to judge this young man. He made a decision and he paid for it. Did he find self-determination? No, no man can exist for himself, the freedom some are searching is nothing but an abstract and nature is not nice at all! She is like she is. Without man she is nothing at all. Nature is there for man, but she does not know it. But man has to know it. The sojourn in nature is a good opportunity for self-reflection. Krakauer implies that Alex could have reached the goal to live his idealism until the very bitter end. He is not different to mountaineers who notwithstanding the risks want to have their extreme experience. There is nothing left than the hope, that instead of the romantic transfiguration of a life in the wilderness or the intended union with nature  a thing that cannot exist  in the face of death the simple recognition prevailed that life, that loves and can be loved is the most sensible and praiseworthy. A lot of knowledge for a young man in our times. A recommendable film and book. Krakauer did not draw conclusions. He did not want to interpret too much into it. Perhaps because he is guilty himself of extreme adventures."
"Arianrhod_B","Null","2","4","21 May 2008"," A journey of a free soul
","Before writing this comment, I was worried about my ideas, my subjectivity and also my admiration for Sean Penn. The fact that Sean Penn has made a great choice in everything in this movie surprised me a lot. The music, the casting, the places, I give 10/10. This movie reminded me of my journeys- and I really wanted to set off the road. It's like, we think, we dream while we are travelling, we plan things, we imagine to find something else new and somehow, we feel free. In this movie, you say, yes there it is. This is what it feels like! You discover, you experience and there's nothing compared to that amazing feeling. Sean Penn reflects this imaginary view through his camera. There are some parts in the film which i can describe as a painting or a camera shot. Those brilliant moments are combined with Emile Hirsch's great performance who appears to belong into the wild. This IS acting, this is REAL. It feels like the film has the effect of a documentary, and in some other parts, you can call it a journey film like Easy Rider and My Own Private Idaho. The number of the characters which Emile Hirch's character comes across on the road is high, but he shines in every scene. The plot mainly depends on him and he does his best. I actually couldn't believe Emile Hirsch's performance, there was no flaws at all. He became literally that person. I almost forgot the end even though I knew what was coming for him. There was just one thing maybe, because of the screenplay and also the plot, he barely spoke. His inner voice was his sister's. Thus, we can understand his ""philosophy"" or his reasons by his sister and figure out his journey which means that his every single move contributes a lot more than we think. Maybe we can define him as a 20Th Century libertine or a 2000's easy rider. Finally, I think Sean Penn did one of the most important things of his life by shooting this movie and he stays true to the character's real story, honoring his life and his purpose. Rest in peace."
"sjree_uk","6","2","4","13 November 2007"," A difficult film
","I found the film to be very intense, and still can't decide on whether I liked it or not. There are a few glaring problems with it, I know, but there were also some wonderful things about it too. <br/><br/>I agree with what a lot of reviewers and posters here have been saying. Penn missed a lot of opportunity to analyse and explain Chris' behaviour, but it seems that a lot of people who want to see this film have or intend to read the book, so perhaps the romantic version Penn presents shouldn't be dismissed as a missed opportunity. The analysis I imagine the book to provide (and will know about for certain in a few days!) must be a difficult thing to translate into film. Chris came across as a little pretentious at times, I don't know if he was supposed to. I understand that he was supposed to be naive and selfish, but was he pretentious? <br/><br/>The biggest triumph of the film for me was the cinematography. It absolutely captured what Chris and the others were so in love with. Beautiful. Loved Eddie Vedder's songs too. <br/><br/>I will definitely be picking up the book, and I hope to understand Chris McCandless when I do. The film was wonderfully shot, had brilliant acting, but still left a little something to be desired."
"klw910","6","2","4","11 November 2007"," Good Movie well Directed, though we should know more....
","we need to know more... about our lead Christopher McCandless played by (Emile Hirsch) we know he is troubled we just get bits a pieces of what the trouble is through the journey. I felt we needed to know more of his motivation from the start. I might be a little bias as I did a 3000-mile walk across country in 4-months. I like how they show the humanistic side of everyone, from the sister to the people who helped him along the way. The people along the journey make it so very real. Though his self-discovery goes bad from being unprepared for the simplest of things, very sad. I like that I could relate to so many of the situations the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California was even part of my route across the country. I remember a sheriff pulling up to me and asking what I was doing out here, (he never even got out of the car) when I told him I walking across the country he said ""you do know this is a desert"". Over all a very good movie about a young man's adventure that is sad and tragic."

","Watched this film without any expectations; realised halfway through that it was based on a true story of a man who tried to set out ""into the wild"" to get away from society etc etc... and trying to ""live off the land"".<br/><br/>Not sure how this film got to have half a million ratings that lands it with an average of 8.1 stars - this film certain did not work out all that good for me.<br/><br/>While there is no doubt some form of sympathy evoked for McCandless - the things he did after leaving college were sorely stupid, silly, foolish and downright exasperating to watch on film.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch's performance was OK in this film - can't say he had a lot of room for development as an actor for such a guy who did such foolish things in real life.<br/><br/>The only thing I felt good after watching this film, was when the end credits rolled.
Yes, this is a harsh review, but the 148 mins watching this film was time taken away from my life on witnessing the shenanigans of a foolish person doing stupid things in real-life, which eventually led to his own demise."
"HarshVardhan","9","0","0","4 May 2020"," Leaves you with a question and somehow answers it too.
","Every human somewhere in their life (better to say often in their life) finds it hard to know the purpose of life. That's because they face situations which they are not comfortable with. It might be a soured relationship with your parents, friends or anyone or any other complications. Life doesn't go fancy and cheesy way as we dream<br/><br/>The protagonist in this movie has faced such similar situation. And after graduating from college he feels the lifestyle he has, which is almost perfect, is full of materialistic things which doesn't gives permanent pleasure. All the possessions are just to satisfy the greed which in the end never gets satisfied. This is a never ending circle. He feels that living life in such a way is just a waste of this precious life itself. So he decides to finally leave everything behind and live life without any luxury and money indeed. He believes that money is just an illusion to happiness.<br/><br/>This guy then embarks upon a journey to live a happy life, the life he thinks will be an ideal way of living. While spending years staying away from his family, he does everything that he couldn't have done otherwise, those things he previously ws afraid to do. He decides to spend sometime alone in the Forests of Alaska an takes it as a challenge. And on this journey he happens to meet many people who cares for him, he even finds his love, but he ignores them all considering them as the trap of the life. And finally he makes it to Alaska, lives there and that's where the realization or we can call it an enlightenment comes in.<br/><br/>What I conclude from this movie is, life is not about getting secluded from this world of people. Though it is also important to experience what nature looks like, spend a good time in the lap of nature. But, living in nature in solitude is a delusion. In life you have to go through many phases, but you need to have faith in God and you must go on spreading love, doing the things you love, spending your time with lovely people. But evading everything is never an option. The movie comes to an end with the quote 'happiness only real when shared'. This quote explains everything.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this movies very perfectly depicts the actual challenges faced while being in the wild. Bear Grylls and his adventures only look practical on the tv screen but when you have to actually live by them, it's too much challenging.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend everyone who loves meaningful cinema to watch this movie. It will surely give u a new perspective."
"DeSjaak","1","0","0","4 May 2020"," No hero
","A movie about a hopelessly naive, snobby, privileged, rich white kid with first world problems and zero responsibilities, who can't deal with growing up meanwhile magically changes the lives of everyone he leaves for the good by just being his wonderful self.
Angry adolescent gets a stupid idea, leaves his sheltered life to go on a survival trip untrained and unprepared and gets himself killed.<br/><br/>I get it: non-conformism good, materialistic society bad. Society is too evil for this innocent martyr. It's a very naive and romantic world view.
The problem I have with this movie is the unquestioned portrayal of him as some kind of anti-capitalistic super-human hero up to prophet-like proportions. Rejecting basic human needs and void of vices. He is not crazy, we are crazy. He gives his money to charity and the old man his last quarter for a phonecall, has no sex with the willing girl he's attracted to (has to die a virgin), heals people's relationships overnight in his infinite kindness and wisdom, preaches on how to live his life to an elderly man (talking down to him from a freaking mountain with light from the heavens shining upon him) Oh, the noble creature!
No questions about his mental health.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie 3 times now with years inbetween and it hasn't changed my opinion after the first. It's a religious movie of cheap sentiments from the start up untill the pompous death scene with the tear.<br/><br/>Excellent music by Eddie Vedder though!"
"baani-39442","9","0","0","3 May 2020"," Truly a journey!
","I think if you keep aside the fact that ""practically"", there are ""flaws"" here, right..like the plausibility of things and how he could have died much earlier actually and how he just walks off and how the whole childhood track was not well etched out etc., keep that aside, and its truly a phenomenal journey. I have been on a few ""trips"" earlier and nothing on the wild side, yet the emotions when it comes to him meeting so many people and making those connections, which end up being connections for life, really resonated with me. In the end he writes ""Happiness is only real when shared"". I thought that was absolutely a fitting end. I 100% think this is a must watch kinda movie despite its obvious flaws and left me happy, excited and sad and thus experience a range of emotions and took me on the journey with it. I love it and HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it.<br/><br/>5 moments I loved<br/><br/>1. I loved the scene towards the beginning where Emile is talking to that apple. Haha, that was crazy good cuz it actually felt like a BTS but they just decided to keep it since it was so fresh and raw (he actually punches the camera) - I laughed out loud during that. The point is that Emile IS Chris / Alex. He has done an incredible job and not for a second did I feel he was acting. It was beautiful and here I felt it was credit to Emile because he uplifts the movie in every scene and you just cant get enough of him even though Sean's direction isn't outstanding (I felt)<br/><br/>2. Absolutely loved the Ron track. The scene with him in the car crying could've felt like a gimmick and just to get tears but it felt so real. I absolutely loved it. Even when he climbs up the mountain and the first thing he says is ""I'm really gonna miss you when you're gone"". When he said the adoption thing, I broke down too. Also loved how Chris never goes outta character and remains ""lets talk about this when I am back"" truly living the philosophy of how human relationships aren't the only key to living and happiness.<br/><br/>3. I loved the part with the Rapids, when he asks and there's a 14 year waitlist and he jumps in - again, plausible? yes / no? he was scared of water? blah blah, dont get logic into it, and it was magical. Shot beautifully and really truly visually a TREAT to the senses. Whattay. Can watch it a 100 more times.<br/><br/>4. The moose scene. Man this was disturbing AF tbh and I think Ive decided to become vegetarian considering how graphic it was - ugh, but again, kudos to the direction here. It was meant to be raw, we got raw. but fucking amazing scene. Also what he writes in his journal post that. Also loved the idea of the one sentence journal a LOT. And the handwriting is too cute.<br/><br/>5. Loved the scene where Jena tells her about Reno and then Kristen calls em for dinner and he goes back to Jena to say he will sit with her all night. I felt a crazy chemistry between Chris and Jena from the very beginning - every scene they were in together - and yet in a platonic way where she really is so so so affectionate about him - till the last scene where she gives him the cap and cant hug her. Phenomenal. The chemistry oozed out of the screen man.<br/><br/>What could have been better?
1. I thought the family scenes werent well etched out and felt unnecessary or could have been told in a better way<br/><br/>2. The Kristen angle - Idk if its cuz I dont like Kristen or what but this track didnt do much for me. I'll tell ya what I loved though - its absolutely refreshing how they didnt show him havin a fling or ""fallin in love"" - haha I guess thats the difference between a hollywood travel story vs a bollywood ranbir kapoor ilahi kinda story. Plus how the Kristen angle is one sided. Very realistic. Kudos. LOVED this in that way.<br/><br/>3. The end - idk one is the logic of it, like he should've researched more ? But then forget that, maybe its a fitting end that he dies in the bus. Really loved that.<br/><br/>Ah so maybe all the could've been betters are also just backhanded compliments :)<br/><br/>Well - this movie did it for me man. Also last thing - LOVED the soundtrack. LOVED the fonts in the words that'd come on screen. FAB FAB FAB movie. Full marks yo. WATCH."

","There are two types of people in the world. Those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and admire 'Chris' for living out his dream, and those that would watch 'Into the Wild' and see his actions as reckless, selfish and pointless. I fell more into the latter camp. I understand the burning desire some people have to do similar things to this, however as much as you may hate your family it is pretty cruel to intentionally put them in such a position. This is a good movie but I think it is based around flawed logic.<br/><br/>I'd been meaning to see this film for nearly 13 years now. I always wondered how they had managed to spread the story of a man going into the Alaskan wilderness by himself into a two and a half hour movie. What I hadn't realised is that very little of the film is actually spent in Alaska. It is more about his journey to get there. Along the way he meets countless people who influence him in one way or another. This was probably my favourite part of the film. Seeing each little interaction and how it affected him. The final one with 'Ron' (played excellently by the Oscar nominated Hal Holbrook) was by far my favourite aspect of the film.<br/><br/>The things that kept me from flat out loving this movie were probably the runtime being about 30 minutes too long, a feeling of the story drifting on occasion and also a lack of drama or tension for extended periods of the runtime. Whether you see this as an inspirational film, or simply an interesting adventure that a man once took, I think everyone will be able to get something out of this film."

But in this movie he did what many people internally strive to do, but never can; because of the responsibilities and the leashes holding us tight, keeping us inside a very narrow circle that does not represent anything of what life really is.
He did not abandon responsibilities, no, he took the more difficult, yet more moral path into life. life is not about money and materialistic perspective, it is not and will never be. the only thing wrong with what he did is leaving his family, and he figured it out on his own, the difficult way of course.

","I remember watching YouTube videos and time to time I heard some stories about this bus but never knew there was a movie made about the person. So the day came when I accidentally stumbled across a YouTube video which told à bit about his story and so I started watching it and I must say even after all these years it's quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie very briefly<br/><br/>The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, made up of multiple chapters which lead to the final conclusion. The story is told in this interesting way which pretty much kept me engaged till the end. The story is about Christopher Mccandles and his rebel free spirit like adventures which start from his graduation till his eventual demise. You can see about 2 years of his life's key évents and people put together in 2hours. And I loved every second of it. I understand he probably had some sort of illness but it helped me live the rebel free spirit dreams I had through him.

","I have seen this film quite a few times and my opinion has varied based on my own growth in life. Into the Wild is a beautifully made motion picture and some of the segments (especially those with Hal Holbrook and those that transpire around ""the magic bus"" in Alaska) are powerful. Chris initially comes across as an idealistic jerk - the kind of guy who will thoughtlessly hurt others if they stand in the way of his achieving a goal. Gradually, he is revealed as being more complex. By the end of the movie, I don't know that I liked Chris, but I understood him and sympathized with him, and sometimes that's more important. Into the Wild is a long motion picture, clocking in at nearly 150 minutes. But the strength and breadth of its material earns it the extended running time. It's about many things and makes pointed comments about the ridiculousness of a society where bureaucracy and the rat race have become so cumbersome that they crush the pleasure out of living."

","A tale of self-discovery and caution. Life is a hard hand. Life is a forced hand. And more often than not, we are dealt cards that don't make sense to us. Such was the story of Christopher Johnson McCandless. His soul, that of an adventurer, had never belonged to the world he'd grown up in. And so, as the cage opened, the bird flew away. It's only mistake? It had never known the nuances of flying.<br/><br/>There's a limit to everything. Freedom, adventure and even extremism. And the story of McCandless, or Alexander Supertramp as he called himself, is a reminder to all of us that too much of anything, is really bad.<br/><br/>Wonderful settings, a fine account of the wilderness and of different exotic pocket worlds that exist independent of the conventions of our society, make this a fine picaresque tale. On the negative aspects, the movie is perhaps, on the whole, a little vague and the exact evolutions within McCandless are difficult to discern."

","Watching 'Into the Wild' again a few years after first watching it found me unprepared once more for the shocking realisation that it was based on a true story.<br/><br/>There's so much anger and self-abnegation (and self absorption) in the central character that it seems too far-fetched. Maybe we all go through such phases on the rocky road to adulthood but few with such driving intensity and single-mindedness as Chris McCandless. The assorted cast of fellow travellers and strays seem to share this astonishment and exasperation in their futile attempts to steer Chris from his path. <br/><br/>This is a deeply moving film that leaves you thinking about its message for a long time. It gives us a glimpse of the lives of the marginal characters at society's edge, all to some extent chewed up and spat out by 'Life'. It's a tough world and there are no easy answers.<br/><br/>A fine and brave central performance, and excellent sympathetic performances from the ensemble cast.

Instead of facing his problems, he ran away and he didn't even write a single letter to his sister who loved him.

But the fact that this was produced by Sean Penn is typical and at the same time comical. There's a song in the film which talks about how much money do we need, and how much space do we need before it becomes too much. That we take and use too much. And yet a quick search shows Mr Penn to be worth $150 million. And I might be wrong but I bet he has a pretty big house. This is where I find the hypocrisy. I don't like to be preached at.

","With this review I have to keep two things separate. What I thought about the movie itself and what I thought about the main character, who's based on a real person. Because I had a hard time dealing with this guy during the film. He felt like one of those overly arrogant Nietzsche-quoters, who always think that they know the truth better than anyone else and are not afraid to show it. So yeah, I wasn't really rooting for this guy, which is a sad thing, because the movie itself is a great character study about following through with your dreams, believing in yourself and the dangers that follow with doing so.<br/><br/>And while I cannot agree with the main character of the movie, I can still admire the movie itself. Because it is put together extremely well. The pacing, the scenery, the storytelling, they all fit together to form a coherent story that's both touching and tragic at the same time. The fact that really caught my notice was the quality of the actors and the sheer scale of different characters. You could really see the effect that the main character had on the people he met during his travels and thus the final lesson he ever learned was all the more sadder because of it. In two short years he traveled all across the country, experiencing and truly living. I enjoyed the movie immensely when the main character was just a young man on a road trip and not some large than life wannabe, who was ready to ignore every hint of common sense in order to prove something to himself.<br/><br/>And I do get the fact that the movie is based on a real story, so they really couldn't make the movie any different, but it's still hard to watch a movie during which you just want to punch the main character and tell him to grow up and accept some responsibility. And yes, movies are about showing us different point of view, different ways of thinking, but there are limits to what you can take before it just starts to get on your nerves.<br/><br/>So yeah, I was left feeling extremely conflicted after this film. On the other hand I despised the main character, his dogma and his cheerful ignorance of everything worth living in this world. But on the other hand I must admit that the movie told his story masterfully, with skill rarely seen anymore. In the end I guess I'm glad that I saw this movie, if not for any other reason than to avoid making the same mistakes and, on the other hand, to live my life to its fullest, happy that I'm here to experience it."

","I'm starting to see a pattern here. I was recommended this movie by a friend of mine who thought it was great. I have a lot of free time at work (ha!) so I decided to watch it. It didn't move me much. People seems to see here the realization of their own secret desires and dreams. I only see a young fellow who decides to escape his problems and, simply, be selfish. There's a trend: a ""normal"" person watches a film about a ""free spirit"" doing what he wants to do and the viewer believes that the story is great, regardless how easy it is to actually do what you want, to be who you want to be. The only problem is that it's even easier to follow society's rules and simply being frustrated and emotionally castrated. Sorry about the Freudian analysis. However, it's impossible to properly review this tile (any title?) without understanding why anybody would find it attractive. This is the story of a scared boy who chooses to run away from his social responsibilities. As simply as that. If people find this brilliant because they cannot do it themselves, fair enough. I won't base a criticism on my personal failures though. There's no real morality here, no big teaching, only common sense. That might be already too much for most of the people I guess, alright. Anyway, that's how it is. Beautiful photography nevertheless. Alas, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters in this film and, honestly, couldn't care less if it's based on a true story. I can understand why this movie is so loved. And also why it's overrated. It's somehow easy to please the masses and ""alternative"" people unable to jump the gap between what they want to be and really are."

","I sort of liked this film on watch 1; a passive going along with the story kind of enjoyment. But watching it again, Sean Penn's tricksy ""directing"" and romanticising of ""The Wild"" became all too obvious.<br/><br/>I didn't get much of a sense of how ""wild"" The Wild actually is. Or how fundamentally indifferent it is. The unsentimental Wild. The unsympathetic Wild. Living out in The Wild without Ray Mears to hold your hand is probably going to end up in catastrophic failure (i.e death) Its rough out there man. And brutal. But in this aesthetically contrived Wild there's too much of Emile Hirsch lolling about loving it.<br/><br/>Sean Penn does too many prettifying effects; I don't want to be watching slow mo shots of pretty young men in showers for hair care adverts, or bouncing about heroically (but stupidly) around Rapids in flimsy canoes. Emile Hirsch as Chris McCandless is too much of a pretty pretty boy. Admittedly, his hair does go abit skanky towards the end. And he gets a bit skeletal. But i never really felt throughout the film that he was ""In the Wild"", living it hard and horrible.<br/><br/>Even at the end, McCandless's horrible ugly lonely death gets the beauty treatment: a quasi spiritual redemptive dying into The Light.<br/><br/>Sentimentality like that kept popping up its simplistic soft-centred ""spiritual"" Penn head all over this film like a beautiful bruise.<br/><br/>Every montage (of which there are many) gets infected with an ""Alt Country""soundtrack of Eddie Vedder blandishments. We've heard these ""Big Americanisms"" hundreds of times already.<br/><br/>If you want a less Hollywoodised take on what living in Wilderness is like watch the Channel 4 documentary ""Alone in the Wild"" Its far more visceral, authentic, and ""actual"" than this idealised confection."
"MarcusJ13","8","0","0","26 January 2011"," Poignant
","Into the Wild is a film based on a true story that sees a young graduate named Chris ditch the conventional and materialist life in favour of a life outside the grid alone in the wild away from his parents and his previous way of life hoping to make it to Alaska, his own promised land. In spite of this being a true story I was wary of the run time of around 2 hours 15 minutes and thought it may struggle in the pacing department. I have seen films with plots far less convoluted struggle to fill a shorter run time so with perhaps a form of prejudice going in beforehand I sat down and it was brilliant. The film does not waste any time as we see Chris living this life out in the wild right from the outset. Of course there is some exposition about his past life and again knowing that this is a true story it in my mind warranted a decent delivery. Was it a decent delivery? Well it was and it wasn't, early stages indicated promise from the storyline but it wasn't the main strength, the first act then shows promise but in my mind gets a little stale. <br/><br/>That said there were significant improvements later on. When we see him travelling and facing the challenges that being alone and off limits gives you Emile Hirsch does stupendously and while yes there large parts of the film with dialogue such as the interaction he has with various people he meets which was beautifully scripted as well as shot especially the scenes with the hippie couple. The scenes with him alone show great ability and in my personal opinion show Hirsch's ability to play the role. Looking at through his eyes was one of the most interesting things about this film seeing really how he thinks. Taking these into account it is hard not to see why choosing this life wouldn't be a little bit appealing and this to someone who very much enjoys his conventional lifestyle. Without going into spoiler territory the film gets more poignant as it goes on, which was helped by (I am going to reiterate this) beautifully shot which fully signified why this man would want live this life. That may have ended up being one of the real difficulties with this film as it could have easily ended up being pretentious gladly it wasn't. The interactions almost matched his individual performance and it was incredible that all the actors did such a great job. My personal favourite was Vince Vaughn's performance where he was utilised and used fairly sparingly. To summarise this film does brilliantly to make the most of one man's main performance while bringing other actors in and knowing how to use them properly. I would strongly recommend it as one of the most compelling and poignant of recent years."

","Chris McCandless was not unlike myself at his age. He knew what had been thrown at him his whole life and wanted to experience anything but that for a while. I suppose we all go through these feelings and transitions and each individual handles it in a different way.<br/><br/>He was intuitive, sensitive, educated, empathetic, confused, intelligent, and thoughtful. His physical and spiritual journey brought him to places where he wanted to be. I perceive him to be a great person, infectious and irresistible, even charismatic. He had to do what he had to do.<br/><br/>I wholly admire the film because it portrayed a person on a spiritual journey....a true story, and I think Penn did a fantastic job painting this picture. The cast was also perfect and each fit into their role ""perfectly"".<br/><br/>The tragedy lies in the fact that the young man died so young. OK, maybe it was because of ignorance when it comes to living in the wild. Maybe it was because it played out exactly was it was supposed to. Maybe it was intentional, but I think not. He was searching and he found it. No one can say what scratches the itch of those who seek. Right or wrong, smart or stupid, weak or strong. Chris did it ""his way"". I admire his courage and fortitude to step outside the box.<br/><br/>I shudder to think of what this man would be doing now, at 40. He was a sharp mind, learning how to use itself, a bright light hiding under a bushel basket. Perhaps his decisions didn't help him, but they helped all of us didn't they? I think he'd like that.<br/><br/>Highly recommended movie."
"robinakaaly","7","0","0","30 December 2010"," Beware of the Bus!
","This was an intelligent, interesting and well put-together film, despite the subject matter, based very closely on the short life and death, in 1992, of an idiot. It starts with a young man, Christopher McCandless, heading off into the Alaskan wilderness in the depths of winter, with all his kit in a back-pack. He crosses a small stream and comes across an ex-Fairbanks city bus parked in the middle of nowhere. It is never explained how the bus got there, but it has previously been inhabited. He makes it his base. The film then flashes back to tell the story of how he got here. Despite an unhappy childhood - his parents were more interested in squabbling than child raising, he does extremely well at college and is about to go off to Harvard Law School. However, he gives all his saving to Oxfam, and vanishes becoming a hippie. He travels around most of America, and meets lots of people, most of whom are nice to him, though he usually walks out on them. He develops an idea of going to Alaska, and eventually gets there. On the way, free-riding on a freight train, he is caught and beaten up by a guard for ""jeopardising the company's liability insurance""! Meanwhile, his parents and sister are frantically worried about what has become of him. Back in the wilds, he lives off game, and the few supplies he brought with him. However, the game runs out, and after a killing a moose which goes rotten before he can preserve it, he tries to live off edible plants. This doesn't work out, so he plans to return to civilisation. However, it is now spring, the stream is a fast flowing river which he cannot cross, so he starves to death. His body is found a couple of weeks later. Whilst sympathetic to him and his desire to get away from materialism and hollow relationships, the film pulls no punches over the man's general stupidity in risking his neck in a way which is going to cause trouble for other people.<br/><br/>The message generally was that living wild in the wilderness is not as pleasant as it looks."
"sickofenjoyingmyself","8","0","0","21 November 2010"," The wild heart of man
","Into the wild follows the true story of Christopher McCandless - an incredibly gifted young man who abandons the material world and burdensome social conformities to embark on a journey of truth and self-discovery. As you follow him across country and a range of stunning backdrops, watching his everyday highs and lows allows the viewer a real intimacy with his character. This intimacy is definitely strengthened by the fact that the movie is based on a true story. It is hard not to experience a whole range of emotions as you watch his journey, and as his push to reach Alaska gathers pace, part of me was left in awe of his sheer will and conviction, while another part of me pleaded with him to come back to the 'real world' and realise his potential. When you watch this movie expect to see a truly unique story, first class acting and stunning visuals, but also expect to be provoked into discomforting assessments of yourself and the world you live in. Do you have the guts to abandon our modern world of material and social constructions in search of truth and self? Probably not; and neither do I. This is what makes Christopher's story so inspiring and exhilarating. <br/><br/>P.S. If your thinking about doing any travelling then this film is a MUST before you go."
"oneguyrambling","7","0","0","5 November 2010"," A well made but tragic tale.
","I might not see this film in the same light as many others see it, not because of anything technical, the acting, or the decisions Sean Penn made in adapting and directing.<br/><br/>I simply think that the main character isn't the anti-establishment hero that he is perhaps made out to be, but a young man who let his blind yet admirable adherence to principle rob him of opportunities. Not opportunities to make money or meet chicks or garner admiration from strangers, (but at the same time all three), just a boy who never had the chance to see what he might become.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is this ""boy"", Chris McCandless, later calling himself Alex Supertramp in a further sign that perhaps he wasn't the mature man he thought he was. I initially found it amusing that Hirsch got this role, thinking almost everything these days goes to Shia Lebouf, despite the fact that he is yet to be entertaining in anything and in fact is downright annoying in most films he has appeared in! The plot is simple because it is a true story, young Chris graduates and instead of following the American Dream and going to college he decides to drop off the face of the Earth and just exist. He doesn't tell his family, burns his money and trashes his car, so why does he keep his clothes and other possessions? Surely roaming naked and free through life is the purest one can be? Also if Chris is such a fan of the environment and is in a position to make a difference with his passion and superior intellect, why does he then ignore that opportunity and remove himself from the system? Regardless Chris and his clothes head off and just slum through life for the remainder of his, picking up odd jobs here and there and interacting with various locals and fellow drifters with the main aim of going to Alaska by himself with only his wits to protect him. There are many flashbacks to various parts of the last years of Chris's life for obvious reasons, as the final stages have a despairing sense of inevitability about them and they would even be more depressing if allowed to run their course.<br/><br/>Hints are given to Chris's decision making process by flashbacks involving his family, who while well intentioned appear to have high expectations as a minimum for Chris's future, which is an outlook I'm sure many parents would share. Given the fact that this is a screen version of real events a subtle variance in their demeanor could alter the viewer's perception significantly one way or the other. I would think the director might be prone to wanting a less forgiving view of the parents to further justify the actions of young Supertramp, as that is more romantic than the notion of a young bloke with a promising future dissing his parents, burning his cash and changing his name to Alex Supertramp.<br/><br/>Well I'm just saying.<br/><br/>Once in Alaska Supertramp finds the Magic Bus, a deserted shell of a schoolbus that serves as shelter and home. While there he uses his accumulated knowledge and smarts to exist, though he becomes unkempt, unshaven and most alarmingly malnourished, and again it is more and more evident that there will be no happy ending.<br/><br/>Supertramp has undeniable charm and the allure that rebels seem to garner, but the movie is kept alive by the many bit parts of those he comes into contact with along the way. Vince Vaughn plays an employer that sees what Chris has in store and vainly tries to talk him out of it. Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker play a middle aged hippie couple that are cruising through life without ever really truly roughing it, and most notably Kristen Stewart plays a young teen who would be Supertramp's love interest if he wasn't jest so damn principled! I have scanned a few reviews when I saw that on IMDb this is one of the Top 250 all time rated flicks, and while I don't disagree that this is a fine film I can't see where the extra point or so comes from. Into the Wild is a sad film, as Supertramp left the security of home to find himself, and overreached his abilities to tragic effect. It is worth noting that despite all the romance and high mindedness of young Chris McCandless the note that was actually left on the Magic Bus where his body was found was a desperate SOS message, not a noble statement of belief, it is amazing that a couple of minor decisions in editing and direction can perhaps elevate a tragic story into one of martyrdom.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7 / 10. A fine film involving tragic subject matter made specifically to lionise Chris McCandless. Hopefully if nothing else it inspires someone to pause for thought before venturing out, rather than sending other young people on a misguided adventure to find themselves.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","What a brand new masterpiece, the story is full of adventure and life, it brings us back to nature - the beautiful side of the world.<br/><br/>We got to recognize the society is getting interrupted by the market system. People has already forgot what they dream for. The ultimate goal of life is not about money, but about the value deep inside your heart. The film is well made with many different views about life learned throughout the grow-up of the boy, it raises the concern between sacrificing nature to get better development in city. We have lost ourselves in a blurred vision of society, and let the ""empty hole"" dominating us and motivating us to work and give up enjoying the nice pieces around us.<br/><br/>Like ""Cars"", it gets us to know what time to stop and look around the things you have in hand. Everyone is stuck into a puzzle they cannot give up the social perception or the belief not to go away for a try to involve in the world. It does give us surprise if we learn how to makes friend with it. We don't always be jammed in car congestion, or being upset for a salary cut and unable to purchase food in high-class restaurants. Have a wider vision, the world is different to us.<br/><br/>There is always strong struggle between the operation of society and preservation of nature. Every human should be of the same status. Every one single man is valuable. What I have been touched in the scene that a guard has caught Christopher for taking the train, just because he doesn't have money or an identity even. In today's world, you have to take up every issues by the useless papers and some rubbish cards. Just one small paper can get you into paradise or to the hell. Identity cards, passports, cheques, ... from when on did people give so many limitations to themselves?<br/><br/>The theme of film brought about is what I enjoy and agree very much. It is the definition of happiness. Definitely of much deeper study in happiness than ""Pursuit of Happiness"". Happiness does not come from money, it also cannot come from independence. God creates the world and get people to enjoy, but not their own selves. From the movie, the most enjoyable moments are the time when Christopher meets every new people in a spot. ""Happiness comes true only when shared."" It shows great Christianity and nature in the movie. The ""God Bless Us"" in the backside, the salvation village has got the characters and audience relaxed.<br/><br/>The superb landscape and marvelous natural world has fascinated me in the complete 120 minutes. It is fun and documentary-like, filming of animals and plants captured in the character's journey, recording of daily conversations with new friends met in his trip. Thanks to the cameramen and editors, shots on the beach or sea are so smooth and genuine, it is like a real travel show but brings meaning to life.<br/><br/>It could be named as ""No Country For Young Man"". The young guy needs to take risk and go everywhere he likes, regardless of the limit society has hanged on to him, regardless of his parents. He really does a ""jumper"" job: Everywhere is possible. In the world we find no place for a young and active person to go free, freedom should be the right to born with, however, life is not under control by oneself. All are obliged to regulations and instructions. Set by whom? God even would not stop us to go on our own way. The territories should not once be there. <br/><br/>It's time to change old men's rules. The world would get wonderful, only a few steps to walk out of our sight. Lead your lifestyle and don't lose control of your life by temptations brought in society. Learn to appreciate everything around, and sunshine is being with us always."

","I thought the plot was empty. The main character feels he needs to travel the world and leave his home because he is a 'bastard' child along with his sister who has parents who he finds out are not married and always fight. His whole life is based off his parents not being married and fighting with not much other motivation for what he does in the movie. He comes across to me as a weak character, and the plot fails to bring him out of this description for me. There were hundreds of symbols to God throughout the movie; sun beaming down on him in key moments, the 'mountain of salvation' scene, the end of the movie where he dies appearing to look like Jesus himself because he is starved, suffering, grows a beard, sun beaming down on him yet again... to name a few out of the many dozens. The abnormal amount of religious and Christian references was too much to handle for a plot. The movie succeeded and will probably appeal to Christians because the movie can be considered teetering on the edge of 'bad' because they say ""fuck"" throughout the movie and there is nudity that an average religious person can giggle at. There are cool scenes too where he brutally chops up a large moose to eat but it ends up being swarmed by flys who lay maggots on it (why he didn't prepare for such a kill is beyond me). Kayaking scene and lots of wildlife scenes are cool too. At 2.5 hours long I can only recommend this for religious types."

","This is a straight ace film, never boring and very clean. It truly elevates the soul. The great scenery is well captured. There was a scene where people were singing country songs, you could almost ""smell"" the aroma of the open air gathering. Running away from family and conventional society in search of one's identity and aim in life is by no means a new theme, but the authenticity of the story and the director's deep understanding of his work never makes you board. The didactic element is spelled out clearly because ""Chris"" came to the conclusion that ""happines is real only when shared"". While people may have virtual names and characters in today's cyber space; while we may sometimes shrink inside ourselves or run away from our surrounding conditions; this film comes to say: live your own life, no disguise no running away, be surrounded by people because this is what life is all about, sharing happiness. The performance was amazing. But the most important thing is that ,since it's a true story, it's a tribute to the young man whose adventures made him realize that life is simpler than it seems to be. Just ask yourself if you can burn the little cash you have and go out on the road, think if you can resist physical temptations when the opportunity arises. can you abandon everything and go out and look for the meaning of life? Shooting the moose without being able to feed on it was the biggest tragedy of Cris's life. How guilty does that make us feel. We only realize the importance of food towards the end of the film. Thanks for all involved in the making of this wonderful work of art. Actually what makes this biography an excellent work of art is the director's successful use of flashbacks, thus getting away from routine and melodrama."
"beckwith10","8","3","8","21 September 2007"," Lovely Film, but Have to Ask: Has Penn Absorbed the Lessons of Herzog?
","Sean Penn has made a lovely film, probably the finest of his directing career. The casting is superb, with some especially fine work from Catherine Keener and an astonishingly moving performance from veteran performer Hal Holbrook, who doesn't leave a dry eye in the house and (no hype here) is a likely bet for bagging the Oscar in the supporting category. But the film belongs to the charming, charismatic Emile Hirsch who does a fine job embodying the film's free form, wandering - and ultimately reckless - spirit. On that note, I'll mention the uncanny parallels between ""Into the Wild"" and Herzog's ""Grizzly Man,"" both films, based on true events, concerned with real life idealistic loner-nomads who find their untimely demise in the wilds of Alaska. McCandless' and Treadwell's stories deal with many of the same themes. Herzog, who has dealt with the themes of trial by will in the face of zealous individual idealism in prior films, knows this ground well, and viewed Treadwell with a dry, discerning eye, both bemoaning his tragedy while indulging little sentiment for Treadwell's quixotic, absurdly romantic delusion about his relationship to nature. Penn is too smart not to recognize these lessons, yet, a cautionary romanticism does creep into ""Into the Wild"" and the film can be seductive - beautifully seductive at moments. Though moved by this film, I am unclear how to come to terms with my ambivalence concerning McCandless' idealism. Granted, unlike Herzog, Penn is functioning as a narrative filmmaker, not a documentarian, hence has an obligation to render McCandless story with a compelling, fully dimensional depiction; any good film maker would recognize this task. But what is Penn's allegiance to McCandless idealism? It is not difficult to recognize the appeal McCandless' story might hold for someone like Penn, something of an idealist (if not activist) himself and clearly, this film is close to Penn's own heart. But I am unclear how Penn, as a maturing film maker, has come to terms with his own ambivalence on the limits of idealism and the seductions of its inherent fatalism. Perhaps future films by Penn will give greater clarity to this."

","First of all,my deepest sympathies with the McCandless family. As for the movie, I think we first ought to take in consideration the ""extraordinary"" life chris led.. I for one, do not relate with him on most grounds. Although I can say that I do have a wanderlust and would like to travel as much as chris did, but my holidays wont be executed in a similar way as chris. I can never understand why chris left his family(essentially his sister)? or why he found it appropriate to form a bond with hippies instead of corresponding with his family even once. I do not have sympathy for a person who goes all alone into Alaska unprepared.I do not have sympathy for a person who longs to live in the wild, but lacks common sense, hunting and cooking skills. Most importantly, we all face problems in life, but I consider it cowardly to run away from them like this. As for Direction and all, I think the movie lost it with the Emile hirsch-staring-into-the-camera tactic.. It was way too long(at least half an hour should have been chopped off) and the sequence shown with Hal holbrook or katherine keener for that matter were not all that impressive. The finest part was the last ten minutes, where Chris realizes his mistake, where all the ppl he had met are shown in a dream sequence, in fact its the ending that forced me to give it a 5 rating."

An interesting narrative, to be sure, and containing some very compelling scenes, but it hardly seemed like anything original, and some of the scenes were totally hackneyed. Man ascends mountain and reaches up to the firmament, camera pans around at majestic landscape, & so on.<br/><br/>There just seemed to be far too many clichés in this film for it be called moving. The sister's voice over narration, full of tired praise for her brother's intelligence, adventurous & rebellious spirit, &c, became tedious. His parents were caricatures of the suburban American nuclear family. The 'nature good, cities bad' message was more than a little heavy-handed, particularly in the Los Angeles scenes.<br/><br/>I found it annoying that in several instances the lead actor looked directly into the camera (for instance, when he is eating an apple early in his travels). For me it shattered the attempt at realism and the sense of isolation and freedom the character was meant to have.<br/><br/>Overall, while not without a fluid plot, solid acting and shots of stunning landscapes, the message of the film itself wasn't anything new, nor was it particularly well put.

","I think I finally found the best picture of this decade. To be honest, I can't think of another film right now that has had such a deep personal impact on me. Ironically, I didn't have much interest in Penn's work as director before, so I missed Into the Wild's theatrical release. My date picked it up at the library without me knowing and, while we were watching, it hit me completely unexpected and left me quite dumbfounded, in a positive way. I always knew it, spontaneous love is real love! For me, the film is perfect and nothing less and I'll try to explain a little why that is...<br/><br/>So, I made clear so far that I think Sean Penn's Into the Wild is a masterpiece which I'm sure, at least nowadays, can't be surpassed at all by emotional impact, wisdom and profundity. At the same time, it's a film that carries great weight for myself (to an extent that only Badlands and Summer with Monika reach, maybe not even those): At one point in my life I had similar thoughts spooking through my mind like the protagonist, Alex Supertramp, had. I was never brave enough to make the next step, though.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is an universal tragedy about love itself, its endless possibilities and, at the same time, its total failure. Usually, after quarrels about continuing or beginning a love relationship most films end in a way that the doubting person goes on a journey to the essence of his/her yearning which can be an extended walk through the city, bar-hopping or even a spontaneous plane trip to finally dissolve all remaining questions and doubts in a kiss or an emotional confession. Here, we don't have this kind of cathartic ending, because the redeeming insight, that one is only happy who can share the luck with others, comes to Alex at a time, ""lonely, scared"", when it is well-nigh impossible for him to make it true.<br/><br/>All the persons that run across the idealistic adventurer Alex during his trip give him reasons to (re-)appreciate individual freedom which pushes ahead his journey forth and forth. What he doesn't see is that all these people actually fill the gaps of affection that Alex missed at his parental home. He, his head full and burdened with dreams, fails to see that he would have found what he was longing for all the time: The loving mother (Keener), the wise father (Holbrook), the passionate girlfriend (Kristen Stewart), the daring brother (Vaughn). The relationships to everyone Alex meets are built up in an extremely touching and sensitive way and, after a short time, are dissolved in painful moments of leaving. Freedom has its price, a price that Alex does not realize and therefore does not have to pay. It's nothing that I can accuse him of, though, because he is an intrepid dreamer who acts out of emotions and that makes him utterly likable. At the same time, it's easy to see that Alex' ideas are enraptured from this world. The mournful landscape panoramas are wonderfully shot by Eric Gautier, often in meditative slow motion with Alex in focus. He seems to deliquesce in the beauty of nature when the camera circles above around his head, releasing a view to the vast mountains of Alaska, a melting that looks and feels breathtaking, but actually paves the way for Alex' downfall. Eternal love pays the price when it is scratching its fingers bleedingly at the abrasive walls of reality - especially when the opposite is the wilderness, always only a mirror and not the receiver of one's own passions. That is the price which causes Alex' death at the end and a broken heart in everybody he left behind."

","The six is for the cinematography, the moral of the story gets a one.<br/><br/>I am an Objectivist (philosophy of Ayn Rand). Let me make a few notes here: If the parents were such horrible selfish bastards, they could have just gone on with their lives.<br/><br/>The character, McCandless, has that ""forced smile"" that I see on everyone that is pretending to be happy in spite of the facts. I see the same look on the faces of Jesus worshippers, that they are DETERMINED to show themselves as happy. I am not talking about optimism, I mean a person that lives on a diet of spiritual poison (idealistic altruism) and smiles to convince themselves its OK.<br/><br/>Objectivists scorn the idea of sacrifice. The term must be properly defined. A sacrifice is choosing something of lesser value over something of greater value. With this clear definition, sacrifice is an immoral act. When he gives the old man his quarter rather than call his sister, that is clearly a sacrifice, and clearly immoral.<br/><br/>Nature may on occasion be beautiful, but it is ruthless. When McCandless is gazing into the sky, he is not seeing the face of god, he is seeing the dispassionate sun and clouds, which will watch him live or die with equanimity. The lesson? Don't count on the sky, except to recognize it is only your mind which is beautiful, with its ability to reason. Your mind is more beautiful and complex than water vapor, or even the sun.<br/><br/>Sean Penn is certainly the guy to create this evil little movie. Surrounded by material things himself, he idealizes the anti-material lifestyle (though not enough to give up his own investment portfolio). He asks ""why can't we just love one another?"" and then forces Obama on us, so that we can made to sacrifice to the irresponsible at the point of a gun.<br/><br/>For more information, please read 2 short books - The Virtue of Selfishness, and Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal, both by Ayn Rand.<br/><br/>Altruism rots the soul. Socialism kills."

","When I was six, I decided in a pout to run away from home. I reasoned that dandelion leaves make a good salad, honeysuckle produces sweet nectar, and some peanut butter sandwiches for the road would take up the slack, food-wise. Not a bad plan--that is, until it was deep-sixed by my mother, who could see that survival outdoors wasn't my forte.<br/><br/>What strikes me the most about Into the Wild is, aside from the exceptionally engrossing quality of the film itself, was the skew of the facts: Chris McAndless had less practical awareness and planning ability than I evidently had as a first-grader (marksmanship ability aside), but the movie presents him as a wise and spiritual soul in the making, cut down before his prime. The truth is that going into the wilderness without a store of food goods, a map, a compass, knowledge that snow melt leads to swollen streams in late summer, or even a coherent plan for shelter were not smart moves. They point to a personality which, though life-loving, open-minded and likable, remained stuck in adolescence at 23. Fatally so. It's a testament to the film, though, you do see his death as a true tragedy in the end.<br/><br/>Jon Krakauer, an extremely conscientious journalist (see Into Thin Air), who spent three weeks in the Alaskan wilderness himself, created a balanced portrait of McAndless in his original research, published in Outsider magazine. Krakauer took pains to point out to the adventure loving readership that personal quests such as the one McAndless undertook are never solo enterprises: loved ones invariably suffer when things go wrong, and detaching from them can be needless cruelty. That version of Into the Wild was a cautionary tale. I wish that element had remained in the movie.<br/><br/>But then, Hollywood wants a neater portrayal of its heroes. Producer Sean Penn, to his credit, saw to it that the original material amounted to several back story sequences that sustained the attention far better than two hours of a wilderness experience would have. He won Krakauer's cooperation in co-writing a screen play, and after waiting ten years got the permission of the family for the film, despite an unsympathetic portrayal. And, especially, he chose a superb cast that has the viewer living fully in the moment. Emile Hirsch as Chris is astonishing--losing 40 pounds for the role and convincing at every moment--fully meriting the six film nominations and two that he won for this performance. Not to be forgotten are Hal Holbrook as the achingly lonely retiree revived by Chris' charm, gaining our full sympathies; Catherine Keener as the seemingly carefree woman who tries and fails to remind Chris what it means when a child disappears; and Martha Gay Harden/William Hurt as his dysfunctional but fully human parents. It was for good reason that the entire group was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture by the Screen Actors Guild.<br/><br/>If only Chris had gone a few more miles upriver: he would have discovered the bridge that would have allowed him to return to civilization. And if only the film had been clearer about his missteps, this film would have been both outstanding entertainment, and a worthwhile object lesson."
"pdjwilson","8","2","5","1 June 2008"," Good but too many stereotypes
","This movie has definitely got something that appeals, but the characters (even the city of Los Angeles) are too one-dimensional and seem provided only to live up to their stereotypes. The abusive father, suffering mother, understanding sister, violent railroad cop, aging hippies, naked druggies, wild Scandinavians, ugly cities, LA yuppies, lonely old man, and so on. Chris wanders through a landscape of stereotypes whose only purpose is to provide a foil for Chris to react to, typically with something intended to be profound. None of these characters convey any sense of depth except perhaps the one played by Catherine Keener. It may have been deliberate on Sean Penn's part to present these people in this way so that Chris, by comparison, seems deep, but for me it made the film much less than it could have been."

","For he's one of my favorite actors, I've always feared Sean Penn would eventually leave acting to have more time to direct. Fortunately he seems to find the time to appear on both sides of the camera, and by doing so he's gradually become one of my favorite directors as well.<br/><br/>When I've first seen the trailer I thought: looks like some Great American Adventure. Guy thinks he can do everything, compete with Naturte (mind you: it's The Great American Outdoors kind of nature, not some national park in Germany where you might forage on the leftover of tourists) and WIN over Nature. Well enough, if somebody like Mel Gibson had directed the movie, I would have continued to have such preconceptions, but Sean Penn made me not just curious but full of expectations.<br/><br/>And he haven't let me down.<br/><br/>There is the American Guy similar to what I imagined he would appear: arrogant, conceited, full of judgment towards almost literally everyone. He's not just smart but intelligent, he's reading worthy books, and absorbs some very good ideas, like money makes us too cautious, careers are 20Th century inventions, etc. But he's posing with his superior intelligence rather than trying to show the way to others. You can't be mad at him, because he's special like an alien from space, however you wont understand what is his true point, because maybe it's not clear to himself either.<br/><br/>Obviously, he falls. He could have easily fallen way much earlier on his Odyssey but he's been blessed by the Gods, maybe because that was the plan with his life. To leave a mark. To make a point. A bit too late maybe, but the stuff landed in good hands, and the moral of the story is not distorted into an American heroic tale, it is what it is. You might watch it for the great scenes, for good acting and forget about the monologues/dialogs. You might pack up to go camping without a gas cooker and a folding chair to feel the need for something and be proud that you can cope with it. You might say what a stupid sap he was to give away $24.000 and a promising life, and you might as well prove your point to some idealist friend/schoolmate over a few beers and be proud what a clever product of the Western Educational Industry"" you are. You might as well go insane and pack for Siberia. You may chose your views on the matter because you are not brainwashed by the movie and that's the main issue here.<br/><br/>I have my own concepts about life, the universe and everything. I hope everybody does. You don't care what's mine, so I don't add it to this comment. But there's one thing I'd like to add to to this comment: go and see this movie! It might not change your way of life but it will have an impact on you, and these kind of movies are harder and harder to find these days.<br/><br/>Usually I don't care much about the music, but Eddie Vedder here brings back some extra emotion towards the nineties when there was a kind of attempt to draw youngsters' attention away from 'The Grid' and highlight more important things than cool gadgets and promising careers. It can be compared with 'American Psycho' where the music was even more strongly implanted to set you back to the eighties. You may as well go as far as to compare the two extreme characters (Bateman and McCandless) and ask yourself to which the youth of the naughties is similar? Personally, I hope that since we seem to copy the eighties right now, we'd get to copying the nineties soon, and without the need of such exaggerations Chris McCandless went into, we could possibly find a more humane model to identify ourselves with."
"chrishogg2000","8","2","5","17 May 2008"," Great character study.
","Contains spoilers: After watching this many people will comment upon the gorgeous scenery or the impressive soundtrack used throughout the movie. However i think the best thing about this film is that it is one of the most trueful and insightful character studies i have ever watched. It is so easy to identify with the actions of the protagonist and his need to find himself by abandoning all of his possessions and leaving society to travel into the wild.<br/><br/>I do however feel that many have misinterpreted the message of the story and what the director is saying about the choices Emile Hirsch's character has made. A lot of people have criticised him as foolish and undeserving of our sympathy. I think it is important to remember that the protagonist ran away and that despite his intelligence he is still a confused young man searching for answers. He knows that he isn't happy with his current state of life so naturally he leaves trying to find happiness elsewhere. I'll concede that travelling to alaska seems like a drastic measure to take in trying to find happiness but i feel that at the very least his actions are perfectly understandable.<br/><br/>At times during this film it may appear that the director was trying to criticise those living in society and settling for their ordinary lives. i think that by the end the message is clearly set out in the words of christopher mccandless in his book, ""happiness only real when shared."" he realises that whilst its all well and good testing yourself to the limits in the wild, at the end of the day the risks and new experiences in life are the core of a mans soul, but they mean nothing if you experience them alone. It is a tragic end shown that Christopher realised this too late. Whilst i can see that this isn't the greatest film made this decade it is certainly one of my favourites as it shows an important lesson in life and is a very touching story.<br/><br/>Technically this movie is just as strong as its message. the soundtrack is great as is the scenery which is to be expected really from a film set partly in alaska. the acting was the biggest surprise to me, emile hirsch was fantastic, I've only previously seen him in the girl next door and whilst he was good there, he shows a real maturity in this film and in my opinion displays a great amount of talent.<br/><br/>To sum up, this movie clearly isn't for everyone as the pacing can be criticised as a bit slow. however if anyone is looking for a convincing character study then this movie is perfect."

","Who hasn't considered the banality of our existence and wondered what it would be like to go wild, living on the land like our ancestors thousands of years ago. This true story of Christopher McCandless and his escape from a life of double standards and lies into the truth of the wilds of Alaska is a sad and moving tribute to his life. I was pondering my own children and whether my feelings to hope to see them succeed and become everything I think they can be would ever push them too hard and they would just walk away like Christopher did. Well I sure hope not, but like all these things they can happen to the most well intentioned people. Though honestly their lives did sound pretty mixed up, you can understand how a someone with a delicate soul simply couldn't survive in it. You are really hooked in to Christopher and his life, like those of his parents. Everyone is portrayed in such a sensitive and real way that you really feel everyone's perspective. A good follow up will be to read the book and see how they pieced together the story from the brief snippets in his diary, how much of the movie by necessity was conjecture and how much really happened."

","I had no idea what is this movie was about; but only because it was directed by Sean Penn, I got interested in seeing it. Before the show at Pathe Tushinski in Amsterdam, I read the story of the movie and realized that this is a true story which was presented in one of the Oprah Winfrey shows, so that got me more interested.<br/><br/>A young man  Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), after graduation, donates $ 24,000 to Oxfam and leaves his family and friends to live a dream of being alone with nature in Alaska. On his journey from Arizona, California, Colorado River and South Dakota, he ends it at the Fairbanks, Alaska  wilderness living alone on an abondaned bus. After 5 months he is found dead due to starvation.<br/><br/>What remained for the world were his thoughts that he penned down in a diary that became a major inspiration for his biography by John Krakauer, documentary Call of the Wild by Ron Lamothe and this wonderful movie directed by Sean Penn.<br/><br/>Director Sean Penn has well matured his skill as a screenplay writer and director (apart from acting) since his first venture The Indian Runner in 1991. He pours his heart and soul into making the movie a wonderful experience of film making. He scores top in weaving the story with flashbacks and not letting the interest drop for a single second till the very end. The cinematography by Eric Gautier is breathtaking, and so is the music.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is a bit of a miscast in this role, but he has given his best performance and after a while it is very difficult to think of another actor enacting the same role. He lives the character in flesh and blood. I would have stilled liked him look more rigored throughout the movie like a wanderer's physical body rather than a well nurtured body.<br/><br/>Surely Christopher was a lost kid, searching for answers. I think he was also stubborn and arrogant, too confident to think about himself that he can survive in the wilderness. He was a misfit in the society and would have remained so throughout his life.<br/><br/>The same day on I was watching the BBC documentary of 2007 Virginia campus shooting by Korean boy Seung Hui Cho, and I drew similarities between these suicidal characters of Seung Hui and Christopher. Both standing on the same cross roads  former choosing violence, and the latter choosing solitude as suicide! Both thought what they are doing the right thing, and they know the real answer. Sadly both did not! This society we live in renders humans into isolation and either makes villain (as did with Seung) and hero (as did with Chris) out of these crazy suiciders. Can we move away from our morals please and look at the real roots of the problems? Sean Penn presents the movie as a message of wisdom words  Loveetc. and misses the real wisdom of life. Yet the movie is a fantastic viewing that I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>(Stars 8 out of 10)"

","I really enjoyed both the book and the film ""Into The Wild."" Chris has turned into a polarizing character - I am confused by both ends of the spectrum. I am most confused by those who hate him. I mean, they really HATE him and why is that? They call him selfish and arrogant and they say he deserved what he got. I am appalled by that sentiment. My first question is: Do you know any kid at 22, 23, 24 who ISN'T selfish and arrogant to some extent? It's called growing up. I just don't have the energy to have such intense hatred about a person I've never met, and whose actions (selfish and arrogant or not) did not effect me in any way.<br/><br/>But I digress - what I really want to say is that Hal Holbrook's performance moved me in a very deep way. I have seen the movie twice and both times I wept for long after Holbrook has left the screen. He just absolutely NAILS Ron Franz's affection for Chris, and Franz's loneliness, in such a profound manner. I was recently retelling Chris's story to my parents, and when I got to the part where Ron and Chris part ways I broke into sobs again. Something about it just really touches me, and I think a lot of that has to do with Holbrook's performance. It is a beautiful thing and worth everyone's time."

I haven't read the book it is based on, so I can't say whether it is a good adaptation or not. The events depicted are clear enough though. On his way through life the main person is changed by the people he meets and the things he gets to do - and in many cases he changes whoever he runs in to. And as his tale grows longer his life becomes more complex and he becomes less of the person he was when he left his city.<br/><br/>As a film it was for me a combination of TV episodes of Jacques Cousteau, and a lot of elements from The Straight Story. Apart from the fact that this film is a dramatized version of reality it never raises far above the level of a ""good"" film. It is good, but not great. The main reason behind that being the way it distracts at some points from the real center of the film - the guy that makes the trip.

","Nearly everyone goes through a time where they are resentful towards their parents, feeling them to be over-protective, inattentive, or that they simply don't understand their kids. Christopher McCandless was no different, but he took his rebellion to an extreme.<br/><br/>Director Sean Penn wants the viewer to identify with McCandless in this way, but his rebellion is so extreme that while he may be likable enough for the viewer to find him sympathetic, it is difficult to empathize with him. This hurts the romanticized sense of adventure that the movie wants to fill the viewer with, which is already hindered if one knows the ending (which most people probably already do).<br/><br/>For Chris, this ""Alaskan Adventure"" is an escape, an escape from the wrongs he finds with normal civilization. More importantly, it's an escape from being trapped with parents who fight all the time, and are living lies that they hide from him and his sister. This feeling of being trapped is something that most people can relate to, but his conflicts with his parents are not developed enough to make as much of an impact as Penn probably intended. Still, we are able to understand Chris's motives. His frustration (and thirst for adventure) are enough to make him leave everything behind and live a life of complete freedom. But not until it's too late does Chris realize that he's pretty naiive and doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. This is a problem (in a general way) that many teenagers face. They feel so trapped by their parents and their desire to run their kid's lives that sometimes the teenagers rebel, but their desire for escapism can blind them to some unforeseen consequences. Such is what happens to Christopher McCandless.<br/><br/>The performances are great. Emile Hirsch, who gave a solid performance in ""Alpha Dog,"" is even better here. He's beginning to show that in the near future that he's going to be a force to be reckoned with. It's a challenge to play someone who is so voluntarily ""not normal,"" but every note of Chris's stubborn desire for freedom rings true. The supporting characters are great as well. Hal Holbrook may have gotten the Oscar nomination, but the performance that I thought was the best was Catherine Keener's Jan Burres. Judging by the Academy's love of conflicted, tragic individuals, it's easy to understand why Holbrook was nominated, but the reality of it is that Hirsch equals him).<br/><br/>Sean Penn is a great director. His use of nature images enhances the setting and the tone of the film. And they're amazing to look at. Another film that came out around the same time was ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" Both films were epic in scale and used plenty of gorgeous cinematography. While the latter was slow moving, ""Into the Wild"" is not. With a running time of nearly three hours, it may be easy to assume that this is a very slow moving film, and probably overlong. Not so. The film moves along pretty quickly, yet everything is pretty developed (except the part with Sonja and Mads, but they weren't that important anyway. That and the amount of time they interacted was short anyway, at least as the movie intended).<br/><br/>Still, even with its flaws, ""Into the Wild"" is still a great movie. Definitely worth a watch."

","First of all this movie is fantastic and Sean Penn and his team have excelled. The acting of Hirsch and all the actors in this film is faultless. Into the Wild is a magnificent film on many levels. It deals with the fundamental problem of many young people in modern society that are over indulged and have everything at their fingertips as far as being 'successful' yet their mental problems and dysfunctional families leave a stain on their psyche that leads them into severe difficulties. This young man could have just as easily gone in to crime, drugs or alcohol with his hang ups and inability to deal with his problems but instead he choose to leave society and become a hobo travelling around the magnificent land of America and surviving for months on end. Of course it could have been seen as a selfish act and yet it was a young man coming to terms with himself and finding nature as the only thing that could help him. He did form relationships with people along the way but he was not able to really commit to anyone and I did not see that as a fault but something admirable. He did carry a special energy in himself - whether it was his vulnerability that made people love him or his strength it is hard to say; there was a combination there for sure. Into The Wild is so beautiful cinematographically; Sean Penn is a master film maker and the movie excels in every visual way as well as never making anything that happens trivial or without sensitivity. This film portrays the real beauty of the land of America and also shows the banality of city life and the fruitless existence that humans can carve out for themselves. By the time the young man comes to terms with himself he has put himself into a very dangerous position and this is portrayed in a way to make the viewer understand everything about this young man without words and merely using scenery and the power of the directing and the acting - it is marvellous. This a rare film and a must see testimony to America, the dilemma of our human frailty and the superb acting and directing deserved awards at the Oscars which unfortunately it missed out on."

I feel so sad and sorry that, by the act of Chris' free will, he threw his life away.

Maybe that's all part of the point. I will give away the scenery as work something, and he did have some interesting experiences, meet some interesting people.

"Monotreme02","8","2","5","12 March 2008"," A long, difficult but satisfying and captivating journey
","I don't like judging actors and filmmakers by their personality. Tom Cruise may be completely insane and his constant pushing of his Scientology agenda can be excruciating, but that doesn't mean that he isn't a fantastic actor and that I won't watch and enjoy hi s movies. So Sean Penn may be sociopathic, and he may push his political agendas too strong, but he's also one of this generation's most intense and talented actors. I haven't seen The Crossing Guard, but Into the Wild certainly proves that Penn is an almost equally talented filmmaker as well.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Penn employs many unorthodox filming techniques and gimmicks characteristic of the much younger post-modern film-making generation of today. From shaky zooms to really creative use of camera angles and positions to jump- and flash-cuts to text scrawling across the screen. Notice how effectively Penn uses cheap-looking video footage to portray Christopher's brief fantasy sequence involving him reuniting with his parents, or Penn's shocking and very risky use of breaking the fourth wall. It is a kind of wild, loose and visceral style of film-making that is used skillfully to portray that kind of no-strings-attached wilderness that the film portrays in the first place.<br/><br/>Penn smartly chooses to employ these elements, as they are exactly what his sprawling, epic, lengthy creation needs for variety and to keep his audience captivated. He certainly provides us with a lot to work with  his film is even divided into chapters, like a novel and less like a short and to-the-point story. The story of Christopher McCandless is one of epic proportions: encompassing two I'd imagine very eventful years, even after selecting a common theme to focus on Penn ends up with a movie scraping at a two-and-a-half hour runtime. But while the crux and initiative of the film is the true story of McCandless' fascinating and unbelievable ascent (or descent?) into spiritual freedom by ridding himself of his money and possessions and eventually launching himself into the wild to live completely off of the land, Penn instead chooses to keep the focus on very particular aspects of Christopher's journey, specifically his relations with other people.<br/><br/>Indeed the only chapter depicting Christopher completely alone is the final part of his journey on the ""Magic Bus"" in the Alaskan wilderness, which Penn splices and intercuts with the chronological series of events that unfolds. The rest of the chapters depict Christopher's encounters with various people and characters along his journey, and although the chapters are named aptly emphasizing the change Christopher undergoes with these encounters, the main feeling we get is just how much Christopher leaves his mark on these people, and not the other way around. He helps mend the hippie couple's love life, he finds a new friend in Wayne, and finally he gives both the optimistically young Tracy and the near-the-end old Ron Franz something to hope for. Even Christopher's parents are drawn closer together by his leaving them behind. What's wonderful is that while Christopher's hokey material-free philosophy may seem immature, naïve and perhaps a bit self-destructive, it is in these scenes where he encounters the various characters along the way that we can see his true selflessness, and it is awe-inspiring. The fact that Christopher's epiphany in his dying moments is that ""happiness isn't real unless shared"" just further goes to prove just what a lasting impression these encounters and relationships with various other people are what kept him going.<br/><br/>On a more superficial plane, Penn, perhaps employing the immense clout he has around Tinseltown, has assembled an impressive ensemble cast to fill these small supporting roles of the characters Christopher encounters along his journey. From absolutely devastating performances by Oscar winners Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt as Christopher's worried but suffocating parents to intelligent turns from the likes of Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener, who plays a surprisingly sweet and happy-go-lucky character similar to the one she portrayed in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and which serves as a total opposite to the kind of manipulative femme fatales she usually plays, like her Oscar-nominated turn in Being John Malkovich. Kristen Stewart plays young, naïve and desperate to its fullest extent, and Hal Holbrook gives the opus performance near the end of the film, providing it with a very important emotional axis. But the centerpiece performance is that of Emile Hirsch; embodying McCandless, he manages to perfectly capture his youthful wonder and perhaps even naivety and delivers a performance of immense power and intensity, including startling and gutsy physical transformations surprising for an actor so young. Indeed it seems like just yesterday that Hirsch was underage and starring in teen comedies like The Girl Next Door: I think it's safe to say that not only is Into the Wild Hirsch's unofficial transition to acting maturity, but also that it proves he is one incredibly talented performer.<br/><br/>In all, Into the Wild is a long, difficult but ultimately very satisfying and captivating journey. Penn takes us down a long road and populates it with interesting characters and unique, unorthodox film-making techniques. And it's all accompanied by a great soundtrack including wonderful songs by Eddie Vedder that perfectly capture the spirit of the film. It is a unique film that takes many risks, and it all pays off wonderfully. Penn has more than proved his directorial worth."

","The movie is greatly shot and always emotionally engaging; landscapes are really exquisite, showing America at its wildest and its best, with mountains, deserts, railroads and other haunting shots of the whole country. Mc Candless's story is certainly fascinating and gets the viewer to sympathizes more and more with the rejection of materialism and with the pursuit of happiness in such a way. It's undoubtedly a thought provoking film, containing many moments of magic, and is very different from other road movies (moreover this is an ecological road movie..) because the story is really genuine, impressively directed, written and acted."
"Special-K88","Null","2","5","15 January 2008"," absorbing and thought-provoking
","Beginning in the early 1990s comes the true story of Christopher McCandless, a bright young man who's lived his entire life in the shadow of his demanding parents. Having just graduated from Emory University, he abandons all he knows and sets out on a courageous adventure of self-discovery. His mission: make it to Alaska and live happily amidst the peace and beauty of the wilderness, but along the way he encounters a series of characters who have an indelible affect on his life. Poignant, insightful coming-of-age tale loses some impact in the latter half, but nevertheless it's a thoughtful, emotionally gripping journey with strong acting and sturdy direction from Penn, though the use of chapter headings doesn't always seem necessary. Hirsch—showing some profound acting chops—is extraordinarily moving and believable as a restless young man trying to find himself. ***"
"mistarkus","8","2","5","3 January 2008"," Quest for meaning
","An idealistic, perhaps immature, young man embarks on a journey both logistically, through America and spiritually, within his own soul.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles his travels, the people he encounters and friends he makes, while exploring his motivation behind abandoning all. He abandons his family, friends and any people he encounters in which he gets along so well with. People really have an empathy and love for him. Yet he feels the need to abandon all that is good to reach his destination and isolation  Alaska. The movie hints at this motivation, but it remains somewhat unclear to the audience, as it would be to anyone as I'm sure it was to the man himself. Upon speculation some conclusions can be drawn, such as; the need to prove himself and make himself a better man (if he can survive with nothing in the wild he can survive anywhere), soul searching for happiness, perhaps running from something such as family problems (and probably something undocumented and unknown to anyone), the adventure and experience.<br/><br/>Critics may claim, with some merit, that this is just a spoiled selfish young man. Why care for someone like this who hurts his family and loved ones for some egotistical meanderings. However aren't faulty characters the truest expression of humanity? Can't we see reflections of this person in others and even ourselves to some degree? The character is clearly seeking out something Grandiose, something bigger than family, friends and human interaction, some all encompassing meaning of life. As opposed to other movies seemingly attempting to satiate our appetites for these grandiose answers but just wets our appetite by feeding us vague tastes at meanings in order to purposely make us ponder, this movie satisfyingly portrays the young man's and story's subjective belief of an answer, leaving the audience fulfilled. The ending is very fulfilling as the young man attains his Wisdom.<br/><br/>The scenery is beautiful containing many shots of the most beautiful, alien landscapes I know of in the World, the West. The movie was a little slow and dragged. It was very poignant for better or for worse.<br/><br/>I think this young man's quest is something we can all admire and make a part of ourselves in a lesser degree."
"come2whereimfrom","7","2","5","18 November 2007"," A rubber road movie of self discovery
","As with Terrence Malick's 2005 film 'The New World' parts of Into the Wild come across like a poem on the screen, snowy landscapes, wild animals, flowing streams and breathtaking skies. I'm also a sucker for a voice-over and slow motion if used properly and here director Sean Penn does both to great effect which just adds to the poetic nature of the overall piece. Emile Hirsch should get an Oscar nomination for his role as Christopher McCandless the college graduate who gives away everything he has, college funds to Oxfam, cuts up his I.D. cards, burns his leftover dollars and embarks on the journey that will take him across America and eventually land him in Alaska. After graduating Christopher decides he want to leave society, find the true human spirit, and leave behind his privileged but stifling lifestyle and especially his overbearing and bickering parents. So without telling anyone he sets off destined to find himself. Told in chapters the film follows Christopher from the start where he re-names himself Alexander Supertramp to the final days in Alaska where he lives in the magic bus. Along the way he meets various characters that in some way help to shape him as he travels and as he grows from boy to man. As well as the stunning cinematography, great acting and fascinating story there is the soundtrack which is at times incredibly powerful, with original material from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder it hard to imagine some of the scenes without it as it is so integral to the plot. Cursed by intelligence and maybe slight madness Alex is documenting his time and when he's not writing he's reading Tolstoy and Kafka amongst others and it's not just his mind he needs to expand as he learns the skills he needs to fend for himself, collecting berries and hunting animals he soon discovers it's not as easy as it seems. But a firm sense of determination pushes him forward and sees him adapt to almost anything. The structure of the film is fragmented and jumps to different time periods which is what keeps you guessing right up until the parting shot which to me was unexpected and left me a little stunned. At two and half hours it is quite a long film but it never feels it and the best way to enjoy it is to let yourself go and immerse yourself fully in the experience. Into the Wild should stay with you long after you've seen it, who hasn't dreamt at some point of disappearing and living free from the shackles of modern life? It is both a memorable and moving film that should become an American classic."
"ikanboy","8","2","5","21 October 2007"," Penn almost comes up with a home run
","Sean Penn delivers his best film, and in watching the film it's obvious why he wanted to do this one. One renegade celebrating another. Hirsh is great - he would be a great Steve Prefontaine, if that hadn't been done 2x already - and he's backed up by great performances from Vaughan, Keener, and especially Holbrook (who gets my nod for best supporting actor award.) <br/><br/>The picture is part ""On the Road"" part ""Wild Fang"" part ""Don Quixote."" What interested me the most was the view of the soft underbelly of America that McCandless inhabited. Penn seems to hold that population in special regard, but it's easy to see why McCandless turned away from them as well: dropped out but aimless. McCandless was on a mission. Test himself to the limit and compete with Mr. Grim Reaper in the wild on a personal basis. Such arrogance has it's appeal.<br/><br/>Penn has to make a choice about how to explain McCandless. 1. Don't explain, just show. 2. Explain too much and ruin it. 3. Do a bit of both. He chooses to do no.3, but doesn't quite pull it off. Not that there can be a definitive explanation, we all know this guy's been psycho babbled to death by bloggers, it's just that he chooses to go the ""family environment"" path, when that seems to pat for my taste. Granted he got the family's permission to go this route, but do families really understand themselves? I found the sister's voice over intrusive after awhile and wanted Penn just to get on with it.<br/><br/>Penn does drum gently on McCandless' insistence on abandoning his family completely, possibly out of respect for the family, possibly out of fear of showing judgment, and in doing so too mildly I think he misses the opportunity to set a harder moral tone. Is there really anything wonderful about total self absorption? But I'm glad that Penn insists on telling us that McCandless wrote he was ""lonely"", and that the brilliance of creation is wasted if you can't share it with someone human."
"imxo","8","2","5","20 October 2007"," A Great ""Road Film""
","This is one of the best ""road"" films you're likely ever to see.<br/><br/>What this road film shows us in depth, unlike others of its type, is that while youth are on the road trying to discover the meaning of life there are concerned parents, relatives, and friends left behind who worry day and night about them. Looking at two earlier road films: the 60's classic ""Easy Rider"" and the modern road film ""The Motorcycle Diaries"", one can see that only ""Into The Wild"" emphasizes that there are more people in a person's story than just one's own heroic self.<br/><br/>""Into The Wild"" wonderfully depicts the naive, but well-intentioned, egocentricity of Chris McCandless (superbly played by Emile Hirsch), a young man who is practically the very definition of high-minded youth. In his search of self-discovery this young man inflicts the pain of loss on almost everyone he meets. I think he knows this, but he's not about to let it deter him from punching his ticket of self-discovery on his way to manhood. I think he also knows that he might be biting off more than he can chew, but to his credit he doesn't let that deter him from his quest. Like most his age, he tends to think he's immortal. He will soon discover otherwise when he reaches the northern wilderness.<br/><br/>It may seem incongruous, but Chris reminded me of some of the Carthusian monks depicted in the recent film ""Into Great Silence."" They too were on a journey of discovery, but in monastic cells rather than in the Alaskan wilderness. In reality, though, I think the two journeys aren't all that different. The one is fraught with physical danger, the other with spiritual hazards. The old British expression says that it's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game. Perhaps in the eyes of many Chris McCandless did not win the game, but there's no doubt he played it very well. As portrayed in this film, he is someone we can all be very proud of."
"jerry_hughes26","8","2","5","14 October 2007"," Best movie I've seen in a long time
","Could have shaved 45 minutes with no lack of message but through time you learned why he put himself through all this. McCandless an idealist because of necessity, not choice---because of family background. Very brave individual but as intelligent as he was in real life, he did not research or plan for Alaska thoroughly enough. McCandless searching and found the answer to happiness (you'll find out in movie) and wrote it in his log, after it was too late to escape wilderness. <br/><br/>Academy award nominations for Hirsch, Holbrook (supporting) and Penn (screenplay.) Hirsch very good choice for lead----his own youth and on-screen, wide-eyed innocence added much to the movie! Holbrook's age, experience and acting ability made the scenes he and Hirsch shared memorable. I did not read the book prior to the movie but will. <br/><br/>Note: Sad point not addressed in movie is the fact that McCandless could have escaped over ""the river"" by simply walking 1/4 mile south of where he crossed in the beginning by using built-in cable cross!!!!! Don't know why Penn did not address that in movie. It would have had a great impact. Otherwise, very moving---tears in audience. Movie a reflection of true life----goodness and purity of heart means nothing when it comes to survival, especially survival of the fittest. Reflect and learn."
"sensorshot","7","2","5","9 October 2007"," Great Achievement
","I had read the book before seeing the movie and they are very different experiences. In the book you project so much into McCandless world, whereas in the film you are handed down more about what Penn understood from the book. This makes it more difficult to absorb because in some moments you gain a sense of empathy and identity and then it moves into another direction. It is difficult to understand if McCandless is a loner, adventurer or just internally angry. With this you lose a lot of what takes a film from being good to being great.<br/><br/>Essentially it is one man's odyssey and personal journey. The narrative of the film drives a certain set of understanding about the character that could have been better addressed if the cast was more stripped down. Too many philosophical points are trying to be made when the only real point is why people choose to take the paths they do. At a level this films tells us what that is but on another level it doesn't add up. There is more to it that we don't get to see or fully understand I think the subject would have been better handled with a different director but Penn made it his baby. By doing that he allowed his own ego to tarnish a film that should have been about the complete absence of ego. Penn clearly would have loved the lead role if he had been 25 years younger so projects it onto Hirsch, who in some cuts looks scarily like a younger Penn - so as an actor Hirsch tries to live up to something he is not. Like a dad cheering a son at football whilst all the time berating him for not doing it how he would.<br/><br/>The supporting class don't have any depth to them because Penn ( and this is a good thing) over estimates the intelligence of his audience to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>It is certainly an accomplished film with a difficult subject and kudos for the attempt but I don't believe Penn is of the caliber of Director to pull this kind of subject off - yet."
"jkantorjunk","10","2","5","7 October 2007"," Movie as good as the book
","If you ever feel like you spend your life going in circles to a job you don't like and just want to throw your possessions in the car and hit the open road, this movie will hit home for you. I reached that point in 1999, and at age 25 I packed my possessions into my car in Atlanta and drove 23 hours west. In Summit County, Colorado, I met up with a close friend from Alabama who had spent the Summer in Alaska and we spent the winter unemployed (initially living on friends' couches). We had the Colorado pass and spent our days hiking and skiing. My one friend said that I had to read the book because it was me in a nutshell. Eerily, Chris died the day that I started at Emory (well the day listed in the movie - no one knows the exact day). Of course what Chris did was 100 times more extreme than what I did. My parents knew exactly where I was and could reach me on my cell 24 hours a day. Plus I was only gone for a few months and not for years on end. That is my own connection to the movie.<br/><br/>I saw ""Into the Wild"" yesterday, and I thought it was as good as the book - and I loved the book. I also loved John Krakauer's other books: ""Into Thin Air"" and ""Under the Banner of Heaven"". In fact, that makes me think that a lot of the people who are slamming this movie in other IMDb reviews may have an ulterior motive because they belong to a certain church in Utah that Mr Krakauer was very critical of in ""Under the Banner of Heaven""... I also think some people might be slamming the movie because they don't like Sean Penn's politics (going to Iraq right before we invaded). Regardless, this was a great movie. The acting was great. I loved the book and was very excited a few weeks ago when I saw in Outdoors magazine that Sean Penn was making a movie out of it. Emile Hirche's acting was great as were all of the actors and actresses. Probably the only actor I didn't like was Vince Vaugn. While he played the part well, it just takes away from the Suspension of Disbelief when you cast one of the biggest names in Hollywood to play a small part in the middle of a movie. I think all directors should never cast big names who don't appear at the very start of a movie. I also agree with the person who complained about the scene where Chris looks at the camera and makes a face. No one was supposed to be filming him, so it just kind of again detracts from the Suspension of Disbelief (a term I remember from my one semester of Film Studies at Emory).<br/><br/>The Eddie Vedder music and the scenery were beautiful. I was excited to see that it was filmed on location at a bunch of places that I have been. I graduated from Emory University and they either filmed an actual graduation on the quad or they recreated one in the exact spot where real graduations are held. I also have traveled to a lot of the places that were in the film, including Anza Borrego Desert State Park in California (about 90 miles from San Diego). These are all really amazing places. It is mind blowing to think of riding the Colorado river all the way to the Sea of Cortez. I might be blowing parts of the movie, but I did check ""Contains Spoiler"". I guess I assume that everybody knows that he dies in the end in a bus, but maybe others are not as familiar with it as I am. To me, not knowing the ending is like seeing Titanic and being surprised that the ship sinks. Hopefully this movie, like Titanic, will also win an Oscar.<br/><br/>I now live in Virginia about 3 miles from where McCandless grew up. I saw the movie in Georgetown the day it opened (it was the only theater playing it in this area). I believe Chris's family was in the audience next to me. There were cameramen taking their pictures before the movie started. This is especially weird because the sister narrates the movie, and the father is abusive, and the mother just sits back. I saw their picture in a magazine later that week so I think it was really them.<br/><br/>I thought it was interesting how Shawn Penn dealt with the poisonous root. The movie quickly shows a montage of his botany book and pages that say poisonous root. This is certainly not as overt as Krakauer's book implies Chris was not a fool since this was apparently an easy to make mistake. But as all the Alaskans have pointed out, it was tested and the root wasn't poisonous. I think Shawn Penn would have done better if he hadn't even mentioned it. It detracts from the real point of the movie: Chris was an adventurer and he tragically died at a young age doing something he loved. Penn had 10 years to have learned his lesson about the roots. Krakauer didn't have the time or budget to get it accurate since the book came out shortly after the actual event and since he was most likely doing all the research himself. Think about it. Krakauer did amazing research by tracking down all the people Chris encountered across the country. I can forgive him for making a mistake about the root. It doesn't detract from this fascinating story. I really don't think McCandless deserves to be lumped in with the guy in the documentary who got eaten by the bear in Alaska. Chris was just trying to go back to an earlier time and live like the original explorers of Alaska. Those people all took risks. Some lived, some died."

","This film was just terrible. It is about an ungrateful person who throws away his future to live in the wild. Based on the true story of an actual person who wasted his life away. The concept, motives and decisions by the protagonist and the real person are misguided and futile. It achieves no great purpose, I feel a lot of us who live in an ivory tower found this fraudulent and pretend Man vs Wild appealing. It is the opposite. I can think of countless people who would gladly trade places with this buffoon who threw his life down the toilet. This is not a positive tale, of a selfish person throws his privileges away when so many in this world will never get those chances and it was all for nothing. <br/><br/>In reality this buffoon barely survived much in the nature, he died after a short time. If he had survived a long time or was still alive and doing some good there would be merit in this film and his life. Sadly that's not the case. An idiot who throws away a promising future and turns his back on family should not be praised but scorned and looked down on."

It means that these scenes are memorable in their own way. For me, they are usually based on the dialogue.<br/><br/>""Into the Wild"" does not produce either of these traits. It produces the most important part of storytelling. It sucks the listener into the story so much that they lose track of what is real and what is not. The listener may forget they are watching, instead of living, the life of Chris McCandless. With every fall, you fall with him. You feel the gratitude and love he has for everyone he comes across on his arduous journey to find himself and his own vision of reality.<br/><br/>Personally, I do not have to watch this movie again because it feels like I lived it.

","This tears the heart. We grift and stumble to survive and our children are the witnesses. What they learn from us, or their schooling, or their experiences, forms them and has to get them through. But the human spirit is stubbornly selfish. Naive. Methodical. McCandless may have shed some of his parent's superficial values (money, social climbing, prestige), but the deeper deficiencies remain. It's still all about HIM.<br/><br/>So here he is, struggling both to hatch into adulthood and to stay in his protective, selfish shell. In a fitting metaphor, he literally dies in that shell - cocooned in a mummy bag, inside an old bus. Yes, he is a fool, but he is our own uniquely American-made fool.<br/><br/>It is fitting that many of the characters in the movie save him, by feeding him and sheltering him, but all this does is delay his self-destruction. If he had survived, what stories he would have had to tell, what a life he would have had to live.<br/><br/>Kudos to the actors and the writers. Especially kudos for the cinematography. Ultimately it's the wide-open beauty of America that baited and lured McCandless to his doom. Finally many thanks to Ziggy in Anchorage for his excellent belt-work. The belt is a metaphor for the whole odyssey, tooled in leather, ominously becoming shorter day by day."

This young man had it all so to speak, a university degree, driven parents and athleticism. However, deep inside his sole this was not his destiny. This film is a groundbreaking piece and is very inspiring and engaging. It makes us truly ponder about what really makes us content as human beings.

","I must say that ""Into the Wild"" is a great movie one of the most touching and inspirational films in a long time that will touch your heart and emotions. The film is done in such a beautiful manner for the way it shows how journey and nature spellbinds and becomes amazingly personal to a young man in search of escape and discovery of happiness. ""Into the Wild"" is inspired by a true story and the screenplay and directing both was brilliantly done by acting veteran Sean Penn, though it may seem long and drawn out to some the film moves at a pace that travels you along for the right amount of time for each adventure and discovery and the meetings of new people that this young man encounters.<br/><br/>Set in 1990 after graduation from college straight A student Chris McCandless(Emile Hirsch)decides finally he must abandon his life of spoiled privilege and comfort from his wealthy and sheltered parents Billie(Marcia Gay Harden)and Walt(William Hurt)by making a cross country journey to discover freedom of life on the road that's full of adventures, rejecting reason, and meeting new people and most of all having new joys and being happy. All along the main goal of Chris is to reach and settle down in the Alaskan wilderness. Along the way this film is told stirring and steady by the use of flashbacks and told by the narration of his sister Carine. Along the way the fun and enjoyment of natures beauty which was inspired to Chris by reading the works of Jack London fails in comparison to his meeting of new people and friends. Catherine Keener gives a good turn as a likable hippie and biker type gal Jan, and Vince Vaughn is a treat as Wayne the hard working common man farmer in South Dakota. Last but not least the most important encounter for Chris is in the California dessert community when he encounters wisdom and learns faith from an old man Ron Franz(Hal Holbrook is terrific here). Proving most of all that life is about new people, discoveries and learning to be happy and feeling good about sharing.<br/><br/>When the journey finally ends and he deceases in the Alaskan wilderness in August of 1992 this young man had seen the light of life and learned faith and wisdom while he rejected phony reasons and the hidden lies of his family life. Overall ""Into the Wild"" is a very touching and moving film a great viewing to uplift your spirits and have you feeling the need for your own personal journey to discover new people and to find happiness. The pacing and direction of the film is top notch from Penn while the scenes of Hirsch and Holbrook together are touching and wonderfully emotional. Again this film proves happiness is best when shared it's a must view one of the best movies made in a long time."

He came across people that he changed, and changed him. The 2 hippies he meets, in my opinion, are like the parents that he wished he had. They taught him what's really important in life, and that's happiness. The old man, was another person who made a change in his life. He loved him like a son, a grandson, and a friend. He taught the old man to live. And the old man taught him to forgive.<br/><br/>This film is unlike many others. The actors and actresses really deliver, and in every second of this movie you can't turn away. Sean Penn made a true work of art, and Emile Hirsch is amazing and is the future of Hollywood and I cannot be more excited.<br/><br/>This is a great movie that will really show you what's important, and has worked its way into my heart."

","A must watch for all movie buffs. Sean Penn has made a beautiful work of art from a beautiful story. The biography of Christopher McCandless as he journey's across America to find the true and complete meaning of freedom, love and life in the most basic form of existence has been portrayed beautifully by Emile Hirsch in this movie which is based on the book with the same name by Jon Krakauer. The music is also brilliantly made by Eddie Vedder and suits the movie in all ways. It is a very inspiring film in a very unreal way i.e. it makes you feel like going out there into the wild and finding the true meaning of life as a free man. Overall it is a complete movie with a brilliant storyline and musical score. 10/10"

","As much as I want to, I don't want to say exactly what makes this film wonderful to me. It's tough, but I can only say that it is perfect in a way that I can't explain. INTO THE WILD is the kind of film I just want to cherish and admire and keep to myself all at the same time. It's the kind of film that really just gets me in a much more personal way than usual. It's the kind of film that I don't want to just spend time praising for fear that it may lose effect just from thinking about how good it is. It's the kind of film that I only want to share with people who are close to me. I loved this story about a guy who decides to escape from it all just so that he can be one with the world. It is such a haunting and beautiful story. One that I just want to take home with me and share."
"lainababes86","9","2","6","25 March 2008"," Absolutely loved it
","To start off i'm a huge fan of Sean Penn's films. Indian Runner and Crossing Guard affected me like no other film ever has. They had me in tears for reasons i still don't understand. I remember crying for an hour after all the credits had finished from Indian Runner. Both films will have a place in my heart and mind forever. When i heard about Into the Wild i was very excited. I'm not always crazy about true stories however, even if there well made they usually don't impress me as much as original fiction. Therefore, I had high expectations going into this movie but low at the same time. I wasn't sure how Penn would handle nonfiction and really didn't want to be disappointed. Well i wasn't at all, in fact i was delighted and impressed. I thought that it was a beautiful movie, well acted, well directed, well shot, just really well put together. I loved the fact that even know many of the characters weren't in the movie for more than twenty minutes or so they were still so memorable and likable. Catherine Keener is never a disappointment for me and continued to give a great performance. I also kept hearing before i saw it that Hal Holbrook was nominated for an academy award and that he gave such a great performance and as i was watching the movie i almost thought it was a mistake because i was more than an hour and a half into it and still hadn't even seen him. When he did finally show up, he blew me away. He was a great character, immediately had that loving grandfather effect, and all i wanted to do during that last scene when hes dropping Emile Hirsch off is give him a big hug and tell him that i'd be the happiest girl in the world if he adopted me. This goes to show that although he was only on screen for about twenty minutes he was wonderful. Like Indian Runner and Crossing Guard, Into the WIld left me in deep thought and an overflow of tears. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone looking for a good flick."

","""Into The Wild"" is not based on the astonishing true story of wild choral-child Britney Spears nocturnal escapades in The Bipolar Express. ""Into The Wild"" is not even based on the ""asstonishing"" true story of wild Governor-manchild Eliot Spitzer's nocturnal escapades in The Emperor's Club. ""Into The Wild"" is really based on the astonishing true story of wild child Christopher McCandless who abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings to charity, and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Just like Britney and Spitzer, his ""assets"" get frozen because of his desire to roam free. Director Sean Penn's compelling film pulls into the heartstrings on the quest of ultimate solitary freedom. ""Into The Wild"" is more into the journey that McCandless took within the friendships he experienced on his hitchhiking route to Alaska. That roster included an affectionate middle-age hippy couple, a fast-talking farmer, and a lonesome geriatric widower. McCandless does reach the apex of solitaire euphoria when he encounters an isolated wrecked bus in Alaska which in turn he calls The Magic Bus. Chris becomes The Who of the Magic Bus by living in it until the song stops playing in his life. It is no secret on what happens to Chris so I am not playing spoiler when I say The Magic Bus becomes The Tragic Bus because he dies in it because of a poisonous fruit he ingested. Chris was eventually going to die anyway from lack of nourishment, so I guess Chris picked his poison. His fragile body was so emaciated that a slight ""McCandless in The Wind"" would have tipped him over. Emile Hirsch's courageous performance as McCandless was enthralling enough to be into the best male leading acting efforts of the year. Hirsch lost an enormous amount of weight for the role; I guess he must have eaten many ""Hirschy Bars"" to gain the weight back. Hirsch's roadie entourage were also into the acting: Hal Holbrook broke our hearts by effectively portraying the emotional senior Ron Franz, Vince Vaughn's ""vaughnisms"" talked the talk and walked the walk as farmer Wayne, and Catherine Keener & Brian Dierker's performances as the hippy Rainey & Jan were hip hip hooray! William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden as the desperate McCandless parents and Jena Malone as the philosophical McCandless also were into their supporting acting. Eric Gautier's gorgeous scenic cinematography was as cold as ice at times but warm at heart at others. Eddie Vedder of Peal Jam jammed it in with a high score by contributing a nicely-tuned thematic musical score for what ""Into The Wild"" entails. However, it was the Pennmanship of Writer-Director Sean Penn that revitalized Christopher McCandless incredible journey into cinematic reality! I hope I got you into the mood to go ""Into The Wild"". ***** Excellent"

William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden were great in their roles, they portray cold and distant characters very well. Hal Holbrook was his role, not simply portraying it.

It is one of the movies I could not think of anything else for days after I have seen it. The main plot is for me actually the second one. All the time during watching the movie I had been rather thinking of the parents role and what had to happen in their live to be as they were in the movie.

"EijnarAmadeus","9","2","6","19 March 2008"," Thought-provoking, unforgettable, beautiful and unmissable.
","This movie tells the story of Christopher McCandless, a brilliant student who burned his driver's license and credit cards, gave away all of his savings to charity and set off to find himself, traveling through the US under the nickname 'Alexander Supertramp'. Sean Penn's directional outings have earlier been relatively dark stories unfolded, but he has never been near so connected to the story as he's here - Penn gets under Chris' skin with a beautifully shot movie, keeping a thoughtful pace through its 2 hours and 25 minutes. The journey is fantastic, cutting himself from his estranged parents, Chris lets his wanderlust take him anywhere, he puts millions of miles under his heels as he encounters people and nature with charisma and adventurous belief - Emilie Hirsch executes the character perfectly, his deepened thoughts of Byron and Thoreau are poetically bent and his motivations seems unclear, so Penn relates to the grasping of Chris' roots to find the dark wake of the young man's sudden disappearance. And Penn uses Chris' narrating sister, Carine (Jena Malone) to reveal why he suddenly broke free from his parents and relatives - and as the months go by even his understanding sister starts questioning Chris and his motives, but she always reminds herself that this had to happen sometime, one way or the other Christopher McCandless was a restless soul who found solace in himself. But the history feels tragic when Chris realizes that he was wrong; he is in need for human connection all the way, but especially with the moving sequences of widower Ron Franz, Hal Holbrook's great portray is introduced as Chris' achievement of wisdom. Because Chris never tried reaching out for something so spiritually or heartfelt or deepened that he would sacrifice himself for the beauty of the wilderness and freedom of no nothing; at the very end he wrote an SOS in which he was in serious injury, and needed help. Christopher McCandless had a unique courage, and you can't help feeling affected as the movie's whispers will come back to you days after watching it. Rarely we see an American film so refreshed with love for the US yet somehow digging for something even stronger, darker and thoughtful with Chris' rapid soul in the crucial revelation - and the soundtrack of Eddie Vedder's remarkable songs gives Chris' another voice than his own, haunted and strong, dark and bright. 'Into the Wild' celebrates Christopher McCandless, for everything he stood for and everything he did."

"Panterken","10","2","6","3 February 2008"," No longer to be poisoned by civilization, he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild.
","I've been anticipating this movie ever since laying eyes on the trailer, late November 2007. I'm a bit saddened by the knowledge of how insanely beautiful the nature scenes would have looked in the theater, the DVD experience is never the same at all. <br/><br/>Now, let's get to it. 'Into The Wild' stirred up a lot of buzz being a Sean Penn direction and being based on the best selling amazing story of Christopher McCandless. I can't say I've had the pleasure of reading the novel, but a lot of comments deem to conclude Penn has done the book justice. <br/><br/>The first thing that's poignant about ITW is the narrative. Penn makes jumps in time and place, giving the story more variation and creating intrigue. It doesn't make it easier to follow, however ITW was never intended for a non-attentive audience. People who can't keep an open mind and identify or at least empathize with characters will not fully enjoy the experience (a word I don't use lightly) that is ITW.<br/><br/>Besides the writing, there's lots of other stuff to rave about. The music and the performances come to mind. Eddie Vedder was not the reason I urged to see this, but it was, not a doubt in the world about this, a nice bonus for me. He's the vocalizer of my favorite songs and the perfect voice to guide the audience in this unique road movie. He also adds to the filmmakers' credibility, having strong political opinions ,similar to McCandless',of his own.<br/><br/>One glance at the cast should get every pure bred movie lover's heart thumping, William Hurt, Hal Holbrook, Marcia Gay Harden,... Not only did the big names deliver, but the small names almost all surprised me with great to excellent performances. Even down to Brian Dierker, who isn't really an actor! Emile Hirsh, only seen in The Girl Next Door, a film I'm not proud of having seen. His performance in that movie belies his abilities. Even in interviews he comes across as a slick Hollywood run-in-a-mill actor, but his performance really radiates feelings of sincerity and dedication to his work. Another nice surprise was Vince Vaughn, he gives the audience a wonderfully natural performance, easily his best one to this day. Can't forget Catherine Keener, always solid, sometimes excellent. The latter applies for this movie, maybe an Oscar nudge wouldn't have been totally out of place here.<br/><br/>ITW is a movie that keeps on giving, as you may have concluded from the size of my review. It's filled with little bonuses. The dialog is not the usual Hollywood pretentious drivel. Some of the philosophies brought forward actually ring true in my ears, something which can't be said about most movies with 'clever' (sarcasm) dialog. <br/><br/>One of the nicest things about ITW (I can't believe I didn't mention it already) is the feeling you're watching a lot of different wonderful movies, all wrapped up into one (not overly long) movie. Each segment has their own curious and wonderful characters, but the movie manages never to become chaotic. And that alone is a testament to Sean Penn.<br/><br/>About the plot/story: I was happy to know it was biographical beforehand, otherwise some of the events may have seemed to 'out-there', far fetched. And that, I believe, is a testament the real story, the level of amazement it actually offers.<br/><br/>As said in an interview by Emile Hirsh himself, the character really is a dividing line audience-wise. Hate him or love him, you have to respect a good film like this one. Extremely Highly recommended, especially for those who loved Eternal Sunshine."

People who leave their critique at that are correct, but missed a lot of deeper meanings provided in this masterpiece. Sean Penn you are to be commended. I believe you did justice to the book and were honest to the story. The acting was superb. Hirsch, Keener, Holbrook make this movie sing. One person who I don't hear a lot of mention for is Brian Dierker(Rainey). For only being his first acting role, he was very good. Vedder's music and singing were perfect for this film. The cinematography was stunning. I've seen ""No Country""... and in my opinion does not even touch ""Wild"" I have not seen ""There will be blood"", only trailers. But it seems to win the Oscar for acting you have to be over the top or over act in my opinion like Daniel Day-Lewis's role, almost like a cartoon character. The actors in ""wild"" did not over-act, but brought real feelings thru about real people. It is truly a shame that ""Wild"" did not get more nominations, as it definitely got snubbed."

"rugg-1","9","2","6","13 January 2008"," missing the point by a mile?
","I saw ""Into the Wild"" last night and have to regard it as one of the best American films I have seen, part of a tradition that reaches all the way back through American cinema with its early use of the Western landscape, but even further back into American literature, not only Thoreau but also Hawthorne and Emerson and Twain. Some viewers seemed to focus primarily on what they take to be the ""stupid idealism"" of the main character, who would have survived if he had only had a map or should have written to his parents. This is fiction, people, though based on a real story. Such comments remind me of readers of Huckleberry Finn who note that if Huck and Jim had navigated the raft reasonably, Jim would have been home free by page 76. Penn makes rather a large point of the pain inflicted by McCandless' actions, by the way. He also makes a point of showing how McCandless is young and at times, clueless. The film does not make a god of the protagonist. It does point up rather vividly how our culture, in its breathless and mindless pursuit of more building, more possessions, more detritus, and less confrontation with the real (the wild, both within and without) drove one young man (well, several, if you count Thoreau and Huck and countless literary others) out of society and into the open.<br/><br/>Let me sing the praises, as many others have, of the cinematographer who captured such awe-inspiring images of the wild and the savagery of our cities, of the young man whose body and mind and heart drove the action of the film (Emile Hirsch), of the supporting actors who offered such believable and moving performances (Hal Holbrook is unforgettable), and of the director who provided such a creative and powerful vision for his story. The film is long, but I would have gladly kept on watching."
"ClaytonDavis","10","2","6","7 January 2008"," Into Perfection
","Director Sean Penn delivers the most beautiful film to enter theaters in decades, Into the Wild. Starring newcomer Emile Hirsch as Christopher, a recent graduate of Emory University who decides to pick up and leave behind the material possessions of the world and walk the Earth. Based on a true story, Christopher 's life ends in tragedy but alas, there is no tragedy in the film, rather the essence of exquisiteness of the world as Christopher shows us everything we should be in awe about, that surrounds us every day.<br/><br/>One of the best cast ensembles constructed this year, Penn gives each of his actor's a objective and draws it out of them like a needle. Hirsch's character, being the most examined obviously, carries the film on his shoulders as other great thespians have in the past like Adrien Brody in The Pianist and Tom Hanks in Cast Away. Hirsch holds no boundaries in obtaining Christopher's most sensitive areas and engulfing them in himself as if possessed by the man. As he travels the states, he meets a slew of characters along the way.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn showing us his dramatic acting chops, embodies a quality not seen by the actor before. Performances in films like Wedding Crashers, which I thought was brilliant and The Break-Up has put him in a boat Jim Carrey can't seem to get out of. Vaughn is more than comedy here, he's performing a man who you love to love, a man who's flaws don't carry any weight in caring for him. Maybe Vaughn's transition will be better and smoother than Carrey's.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener, who has been on my bad list as of late for her mediocre nominated performance in Capote, as completely revolutionized her acting game. With a sense of grace and splendor, Keener shows she can inhabit a character and let her ware on her soul. You can see pain and joy throughout the film, and when she's off screen you can't wait until you see her again. When she returns, you're overcome with joy because you knows Christopher is in safe hands.<br/><br/>Young talents, Kristin Stewart and especially Jena Malone are sensational. Stewart as the smitten young girl in need of love is heartbreaking altogether. Malone who has showed some promise in her earlier career with performances in Stepmom and Saved! shows something original and tender as Christopher's estranged sister. As she narrates the picture, you can hear the passion and desolation in her voice. As she tries to gives us insight into her family's world and the reasoning behind Christopher's exit, we're shown the tragedy of the American lifestyle everyone so desperately yearns for. Money, wealth, and materials cannot buy love, compassion, and safety. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden hold those images to heart as they give their performances as Chris' parents.<br/><br/>It's in the final twenty minutes in the film when Christopher meets his last major human contact. A old man exemplifying loneliness to the most potent degree and humanity in the most striking wonders. Hal Holbrook takes on this role and completely shatters all acting competition and gives on the best performances of the year and by far, his career. Holbrook, showing anguish in his eyes, layers the character with emotion upon emotion. Its in his finale encounter with Christopher he seals the award for Best Supporting Actor at this year's Academy Awards.<br/><br/>As stated before, Penn's direction here even though forceful in audience's attention, is no laughing matter. He ranks himself amongst the greats of other directors, Clint Eastwood, Sidney Lumet, etc. As powerful as he usually is in front of the camera, he's even more effective behind it. Into the Wild, is truly the most breathtaking and moving film of the year. All should experience it, and I myself, wish that I could live if a ¼ of what this man did in his final years of his life.<br/><br/>Grade: ****/****"
"blairgallop7","10","2","6","6 January 2008"," The adventure of a lifetime
","In my view,one of the best films of the year,Into the Wild is so good and dramatic that it should get a couple of Academy Award nominations.Emile Hirsch stars as Christopher McCandless who is a recent graduate at Emory University but decides to give up his possible future career for exploring Alaska without money.Because Emile Hirsch put a lot into this film such as losing more than twenty pounds and all,I think that he should be nominated at least for an Academy Award for Best Actor as he put in just as much,if not more work than most other potential candidates.Academy Award winners Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt provide good supporting roles as well as Academy Award nominee Catherine Keener and in a way,Vince Vaughn.Besides an Oscar nomination for Emile Hirsch,Into the Wild should also be nominated for Best Picture,Best Director-Sean Penn and Best Writing.Bravo!"

","I understand the needs for reasoning such abnormal and extreme behavior but, I don't think that his family and childhood experiences are the reason for that. If that was the case then we would have seen these kind of things happening a lot more frequently. I think that Chris was a very sensitive person, and perhaps, too sensitive for our tough society....I guess escaping to the wild will be the best solution for those who constantly suffers the unfairness of being. So I would personally prefer the movie without all that popular psychology and put some more emphasis on his unique and special personality, that is an extraordinary sensitiveness combined with a beautiful and idealistic mind."

","""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is rapture on the lonely shore, There is society where none intrudes, By the deep sea and the music in its roar; I love not man the less, but nature more."" -Lord Byron <br/><br/>An unforgettable cinematic experience. Yesterday, I caught the last showing of this film... and I am glad I did. Based on a true story of an extraordinary person, it tells the story of Chris McCandless, an exceptionally intelligent person, who's on a journey of his life to avoid the ""system"" He doesn't like how the world works, where people die or get killed and in the world where politicians and parents (Chris' parents were always fighting during his youth) rule. He doesn't want any ""things"" in life: No watch, no car, no money, etc, because he believes things can't buy him happiness it's his want for freedom that does (in his case, nature). That's why he has a motivation to go on a journey, to Alaska. At the end, I think what Chris is trying to accomplish is to find the inner self and live in the most peaceful and purest place on earth, the place where everything is poetic, and the place where nature rules instead of mankind. <br/><br/>I praise Sean Penn for a great effort in directing and writing and also Emile Hirsch for a soulful performance that truly captivated my heart. I didn't know he had it in him, a surprising turn and I will be looking forward to his future movies. And last but not least, Eddie Veddar, who expressed Chris' feelings through the power of music. <br/><br/>""I read somewhere... how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong... but to feel strong."" - Christopher Johnson McCandless <br/><br/>I guess it's true when people say there's nothing beautiful than nature itself."
"archiecm","10","2","6","11 December 2007"," Fit my taste exactly
","I read the book and liked it. And the movie was true to the book. (Movie even better in some tiny ways). I note that reviewers feel about this film more or less the way they feel about its subject, Chris McCandless. The judgments range from spoiled/ingrate to tragic hero. Most are personalizing the film based on their own histories regarding parental anger and forgiveness. I certainly did with my narcissistic doctor father. <br/><br/>Editorial note: Some people repress their parental anger--even to the point of not allowing it to come to the surface at all. The rage stays hidden and what you see is their fear when someone else ""indulges"" theirs. <br/><br/>I now see McCandless as having lived a fruitful life albeit a dangerous one. Danger-lovers have fuller lives, perhaps, but they ""takes their chances."" McCandless IS a hero, however, in the sense that he was ""out there""--he wanted truth or nothing."
"charlie_mc_us","10","2","6","30 November 2007"," wonderful
","This is a wonderful movie. There are many shots I saw the first time around that are some of the best moments I've ever seen on film (and I'll have to see it again -- I'm sure there were many I missed): Where we first see Christopher walking in Los Angeles, instantly recognizable as a homeless man, and not Supertramp; Where the slab park singer is walking with Christopher, just behind his shoulder -- you see longing in two people walking -- that's art, folks -- isn't that the kind of thing films are supposed to be doing?; Many of the shots of homeless people in Los Angeles -- lots more -- if you love films, you should run to see this.<br/><br/>Has any director ever shot people just walking and talking better than Sean Penn does in this movie? I don't think so. Those moments where you see a face, see a reaction, and in life, you ignore it, or at least you don't comment on it. There are many dozens of moments like that in this movie, where you do see those moments, you are encouraged to experience them, and those moments are all loving in this movie, even when the character is doing some bad stuff.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that some of the just folks in this movie are not actors. This achieves one of those things that is rare in art, where it reaches out and touches life, and thus draws you in even more.<br/><br/>I read the story in Outside Magazine years ago, then I read the book. I gotta say, Sean Penn's movie is better than the book, at least where I read it. Because, with the movie, you can decide for yourself whether Christopher is a hero or not -- but with the book, I ended up with this picture of a poor misguided kid wasting away in that bus -- (that artifact of a past that was not even his) -- but in the movie, I saw that bus as taking that kid somewhere. And it's the first movie in many many years that took ME somewhere.<br/><br/>How is it that Sean Penn gets better acting out of actors than any other director? I've never liked Hal Holbrook in anything, and he is superb in this. Catherine Keener as a hippie? You expect her typical shtick, maybe -- but she's amazing in this. Same thing with Vince Vaughn -- likable to begin with, even more likable when he underacts. And Christopher, with his face in almost every shot? I expected that Penn, given his overwrought actor-heroes (I won't name names), would show the classic hard glassy eyes of the lost, with that kid. But that's not how Penn did it at all. I liked (and felt I understood) Christopher more and more as the movie went on. And when I saw Christopher's last message to the world -- his little sign on the bus -- that's one of the most profound things in any film, ever."

","First off, this film and especially Hal Holbrook are Oscar material in my mind. Hal's character was perfectly cast and perfectly well done. Exceedingly believable and quite touching. Kudos to the director, casting person, and to Mr. Holbrook. I suspect this will be another highlight of Mr Holbrooks career. Along with his Mark Twain effort. Holbrook deserves an Oscar. I was quite moved.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie is not judgmental. It presents the story in an even handed way. You the viewer, decides who is ""evil"" and who is not. The many critiques or kudos here are based on peoples own perceptions and filtered through their own time and place in their mental, ethical and chronological and societal place.<br/><br/>Younger people may see the main character as stupid or wonderfully idealistic.<br/><br/>To me it was the story of a young man, who is idealistic, and genial, at the same time, who can not make any meaningful connections due to..youth, and trouble in his background. And makes some mistakes along the way as young people will.<br/><br/>In his travels he has opportunity to grow spiritually. Does he succeed? Watch and find out.<br/><br/>Having more than once..turned to nature and actually raised my hands to the heavens on a mountain or two (usually naked) I could empathize with his search for solace there.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good. The main and supporting actors were great. The story a nice meditation on human connections."

","Sean Penn has given those adventurous enough to see Into The Wild a prodigious/edifying epic. To use gutter language, he **really** shot his wad with this masterpiece. It's almost hard for me to put into words how good this film is by touching on so many different life aspects and yet melding them all together in order to have a resultant grand brush stroke.<br/><br/>Christopher McCandless is played by Emile Hirsch. He acts well beyond his years. The remaining cast is too numerous to list, but they all turn in fabulous work. Christopher graduates from college, has some money saved, looks back at his past, decides a charity could use the money in a good way, gives one a check, burns all his previous ties to everyday ho-hum life after he recalled his upbringing and not necessarily wanting his children to have to be put through the same stuff. After eliminating the identifying markers from himself to the past, he wanders through South Dakota, Arizona, and Mexico before heading to Alaska.<br/><br/>This movie has too many philosophical points brought up and dealt with to name here or mar your own viewing pleasure, but I will boldly and forcefully say that any self-respecting movie lover will be in awe while leaving the theater afterward. They may well want to go multiple times like I did. Don't let this go to DVD or a second-run theater, or you will be forever kicking yourself. Hurry up--it won't be playing new much longer!"

A man's private journey to becoming his own person, a quest for truth, adventure and freedom. ps: Animal lovers beware of some -off-the-beaten track- scenes involving animals which are though kind of justified by the plot...<br/><br/>Overall an experience...

","I've seen many a movie I thought deserved an Oscar. Into the Wild deserves something greater. It would be like giving Jesus the Nobel prize for peace. If thats all you got, then it ain't good enough. Sean Penn has created a haunting masterpiece that is more akin to visual poetry than cinema. Christopher McCandless, the main character, leaves everything behind but what he can carry and embarks on a journey across America that takes him to the wilds of Alaska. His journey is as much spiritual as physical. You could well take any single frame of this movie and hang it as a prized photograph on your wall. Along the way McCandless deeply touches the lives of others he meets. I find myself to be one of them."

","At first, I suffered the delusion that the main character was an annoying go getter who worried too much about people being selfish and materialistic. But little does the audience know, Sean Penn is just an A-hole and likes to shove family drama in your face till you're drenched in tears. However long it takes you to get over the fact that the movie has a message and that if you're one of those people to judge the character by his actions only, and not the lesson to be learned in the end, then just leave the movie theater and don't look back. Honestly, this film is what film makers should look forward to conceiving and retiring from.<br/><br/>Although Emile Hirch doesn't put together an Oscar worthy performance, one that will turn heads like Cate Blanchett's winded and terrific Elizabeth, or Benicio Del Torro's addict antics, he sustains character throughout and gives a performance that is memorable in the fact that as the man he plays grows, you see him grow as well. And speaking of the character, he's straightforward but still very intriguing. Alexander Supertramp otherwise known as Alex Maccendless, needed an escape from his home sweet home, for reasons that seem to be on the surface, but are actually revealed to be deeper in the end.<br/><br/>The people around him, the people he meets and loves and changes are so real and a-typical, that the actors seem lost in some kind of delusion that they may actually be a hippie, or a man that just got busted for watching illegal satellite television. I'd go on but I woudn't want to spoil any kind of archetype you may be waiting for.<br/><br/>The movie, with it's much needed and refreshing meaningful shots of our protagonists point of view expressed through heavy nature watching and blunt nudity, is something that you do not see in cinema anymore, unless it's done badly by an indie or art director trying to be angst. It feels as if this movie leaps ahead of its budget and production and attempts to send you it's final message, revealed in its final chapter, as an actual morally defined and virtuous one. Though a big deal that Penn made with the main character was that he looked into the camera a lot which i fond strange, but oddly balanced at the same time. And I mean balanced as in the fact that it may have taken itself a little seriously at times, but it did loss en up a bit, god bold, and the fourth wall, though still broken, gave a realness to the character.<br/><br/>Though the ending will leave you feeling sore and some numb, you will eventually come around to learn that the lesson that must be learned, must be lived first, and if it takes a cast like this to express it on film, then by damn, let it be learned and expressed.<br/><br/>""True Happiness can only be achieved when you have someone to share it with."""

","When Sean Penn directed his first feature film, 'The Crossing Guard', some years back, I thought to myself, ""this is someone I think will go places as a director"". He has managed to craft himself a finer than fine film about a young man (played by Emille Hirsch)who is dissatisfied with the material world & strives to find a more pure existence in life. He gives away most of his belongings (including a sizable cash inheritance),takes up a backpack & takes to the open road to find himself. Along the way,he meets up with a variety of people (some good,others not so good,and some really bad). Does he find his proverbial nirvana? Well,you'll just have to see it to find out for yourself. The photography is a treat for the eye. The film is a bit long (140 minutes),but don't let that throw you. Even if this film doesn't merit so much as one Oscar, it's still well worth checking out."

","When you walk out of theater, you look at life differently, you value things around you differently, you treat people differently, in short, you are a different person after watching this movie. This movie has that life changing experience on you. Very few movies have that effect on you. In my life, this is the second such movie. The movie is so human-centric, so value-centric, it touches you right on your innermost conscience. I salute Sean & John for giving me not only a wonderful masterpiece, but also for giving me a lesson in life! Although this movie deserves all the accolades, but anticipating that in itself will be a dishonor to the movie. Its beyond awards, and all the materialistic notion that world has set as a yardstick to measure the merit of a movie. Its to be felt, deep within.<br/><br/>If every person imbibes little bit of Chris in themselves, the world will be a much better place. The fact that its a true story (which I didn't know until I saw it), affects you even more. It sure does make you more aware of the nature and people around you.<br/><br/>I am most certainly going to watch the movie again. We all have a lot to learn from Chris' experience with life, nature, people! Wish the film has a positive impact on every person's life.

","A quiet, contemplative movie with heartbreaking performances by Emile Hirsch and Hal Holbrook. No movie in the last 5 years can match this film's emotional impact. The camera work is beautiful and as innovative as any I have seen in a long time. Penn's direction has taken a quantum leap from ""The Pledge"" to ""Into the Wild"". The music, contributed by Eddie Vedder is astonishingly good and fits perfectly within the scenes. Arguably the finest example of American film in recent memory. Unquestionably the best work of Penn's career, in front or behind the camera. Catherine Keener and William Hurt are excellent, as one can usually expect, Jena Malone lends layers to the film with superb narrative work. I am not a polished enough writer to do ""Into the Wild"" justice but I am not ashamed to say I cried throughout the whole movie."

","There are hundreds of inspirational movies made, ones with people that somehow teach the underprivileged unteachable, basketball teams that overcome odds. This movie is inspirational in that it tugs at you to be something better, to step outside of yourself and your comfort zone, without the warm fuzzy outcomes.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with no preconceptions; I haven't read the book and only knew that Emile Hirsch was in it. I was really just astonished at the magnitude of the whole thing. This movie takes on a story and locations that needed to be huge and totally embraces it. Every scene is shot beautifully, with some really breathtaking moments. The acting is great, Hirsch is completely believable, Hal Holbrook is heartbreakingly wonderful, and of course Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt are always great. The relationship between Hirsch and Catherine Keener plays perfectly. I was surprised at how long the film went on (2 and 1/2 hours) but couldn't think of anything that didn't need to be there.<br/><br/>The thing that I found so great about this movie was its relevance. Though I doubt many people are so eager to go put themselves in such dangerous wilderness, the sentiment hits close to home. In an age of devout commercialism I think most people can understand the urge to try to find something pure in the world. This movie makes you want to go out and look for it."

","The protagonist of this beautiful tale does not like his parents. Sure, all parents have problems. Our fellow does not want to be part of the problem, he wishes to understand true form of ""Living with nature, the way life was"", he wishes to escape all this hypocrisy and the race for riches and luxury, he just wants to BE. After graduating from college he donates all his life savings to charity, burns all his ID cards and starts a journey in search of Identity. His destination is the great Alaska and its pristine beauty.<br/><br/>Along the way we meets various people, does odd jobs, finds glimpses of joy, boundless energy, touches lives spent mourning loss, shares lives spent searching for happiness and meets lives spent ""Living"". Each one of them is a part of that Jigsaw puzzle our boy is trying to solve. The performance of folks on the road are extremely good, they make us share the bumpy ride, we understand their feelings and care for them. We also get to see the boy's parents in a new light. Its hard not to feel their pain caused by knowing they just might've lost him.<br/><br/>Every week, many of us spend a few hours thinking about life. We all long to escape from this ""Routine"". What we rarely realize (and this movie reminded me) is that beauty and happiness is everywhere. There is so much of it, that we don't have to ""Escape"". Its tough to understand what makes people do such seemingly drastic actions in life, take an adventure into the wild for months, live the life of a Hippie, be a nudist, be a rebel or just be different? Do we always have to look for a reason and if things go wrong, should we always have to place the blame ?<br/><br/>The movie is very beautiful and smooth. Acting is good all around, and the background score helps a lot to elevate the mood. I am very impressed by some screen shots, I just wish to take a picture and upload to my Flickr. I highly recommend this movie if u feel that longing... of just any kind. My friend Kesava said this recently..."" We cannot explain every person's actions.

","Lets start by saying, I honestly liked this flick. I also am very tickled at the demographic female/male breakdown on the vote score..nearly all the ladies rated at or above a 9. Personally, let me lay down the downers first. It just seemed to drag on around the second hour mark so much so that I wanted to go use the bathroom but I didn't and I will expand on that in a bit. It was also a bit clichéd and painted the main character as a ""savior"" of sorts which may or may have not been the case. The positives though are abundant. The scenes are well laid out and the scenery can be spectacular hence why I chose to punish the bladder. I am a sucker for any refresher on the coming of age/Catcher in the Rye/On the Road theme and thus wanderlust is certainly welcome. I also thought that as a paradigm of how to step back from the frenetic touch of the modern world it did wonderfully and we could all walk away learning a lesson or two though probably not going to that extreme.

","An intelligent, but socially dysfunctional, white boy, who comes from a privileged family, does not plan his road trip very well and becomes a victim of nature. Nature should never be underestimated or minimized in any way in road trips of this kind. The hippie message of the film is quite clear, and brought back fond memories of my youth. It also brought back recollections of mistakes that were made during that era as well by us who dropped out and tuned in.
Being a tramp is not a great adventure. Ask any of the thousands of families who lost loved ones during the Great Depression (see Grapes of Wrath). Usually, being a tramp is a gradual decline into oblivion. Nature is not free. There is a price to be paid for everything in life. Burning money is not symbolic; it is just plain stupid. There are millions on the earth who would love to have that money so they could eat a good meal. This young man's life was tragic, but there was a lesson to be learned from it. People born of parents who are not privileged would never attempt anything like this. But his final words were too late to save him; happiness is only worthwhile if it is shared."

","Jon Krakauer's novel,""Into The Wild"" was a book assigned during my English courses when I was still in college.I found the book interesting since I have always been intrigued by the travel stories of Christopher McCandless.When it was turned into a movie,I expected a little less compared to the non-fiction novel I read.The talented actor,Sean Penn did not disappoint me in terms of his screenplay and his directorial effort for the book's adaptation into the big screen.It became an epic movie no less.<br/><br/>The story starts in April 1992.It was during that time that Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) arrives in a remote area of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska and sets up a campsite in an abandoned bus. At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts wild animals with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares for himself a new life in the wild.<br/><br/>Two years earlier in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly afterwards, McCandless rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. He donates nearly his entire savings of $24,000 to Oxfam and sets out on a cross-country drive in his well- used, but reliable Datsun to experience life in the wilderness. However, McCandless does not tell his parents Walt (William Hurt) and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden) nor his sister Carine (Jena Malone) what he is doing or where he is going, and refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, leaving them to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate.<br/><br/>Years later at the abandoned bus, life for McCandless becomes harder and he becomes less discerning. As his supplies begin to run out, McCandless realizes that nature is also harsh and uncaring. In the pain of realization, McCandless concludes that true happiness can only be found when shared with others and seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the thaw, and thus he is unable to cross. Saddened, McCandless returns to the bus, now as a prisoner who is no longer in control of his fate and can only hope for help from the outside. In a desperate act, McCandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants, but he confuses similar plants and becomes ill as a result. Slowly dying, McCandless continues to document his process of self-realization and accepts his fate, as he imagines his family for one last time. He writes a farewell to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. Two weeks later, his body is found by moose hunters. Shortly afterwards, Carine returns her brother's ashes by airplane from Alaska to Virginia in her backpack.<br/><br/>This film is has a powerful message about the effects of our uncompromising choices in life;a person's search for identity and place in this world; and most of all,that people need to connect with one another in this journey called life especially with one's family.Those are the things that McCandless realized at the time of his death.Too bad,that he never knew them until he had gone to the wilderness.<br/><br/>Aside from that,this movie is a character study of Christopher Johnson McCandless.When one sees the film,you either love him or hate him. It never presented him a hero or a martyr for his philosophical ideas nor idealism.It also presented him as a selfish person who wanted to inflict pain in his family as he was probably on conscious ""suicide journey"" into the wilderness.The confusion it brings is what makes the movie a great one.A viewer can relate to him one way or another.<br/><br/>It was truly one of the best films I have seen in myself.Sean Penn has simply created one of the best films that a person could relate to especially in his search for the meaning of life."

The goal of the journey is to find total freedom, and along the way everything else must be sacrificed including relationships and material wealth.<br/><br/>In the end, alone on his death bed, the man realizes that while he has almost reached total freedom he has lost too much along the way and that as a human being you are dependent on other individuals, not only for survival, but ultimately also for happiness. To achieve happiness, you have to sacrifice some of your own freedom and goals. I, and I think many others as well, can certainly relate to the struggle to achieve this balance in life, and that's what makes the movie so beautiful and effective.<br/><br/>Besides having a thought-provoking story, it's a beautifully made film with exquisite acting and photography."

His parent's treachery and the lies that surround him. Hirsch does a beautiful job of playing Chris. He completely inhabits the role and brings out a staggering performance. Since Sean Penn himself is such a great actor maybe it was easy to bring out a performance of this magnitude in another. The film is aided by a perfect supporting cast. Every single person in this movie has done a good job. Right from Vince Vaughn to Jena Malone who plays Chris' sister and she also narrates the movie.<br/><br/>Credit must be given to Sean Penn.

It is difficult to take a true story & put it on film without going too far into fictional events to make the film more appealing to a wider audience. Penn has the guts here to make this film more a work of Art, & this is to be appreciated.<br/><br/>The main story is really pretty depressing. A son who is totally detached from his family, graduates college & then disappears going as far away from them as he can get. Told in an unusual manner by his sisters narration, this film starts in the present & then goes back & forth tracing his life route from graduation across the country in search of his goal of exploring Alaska.<br/><br/>There is no glory in his quest. He is a 23 year old who feels he is not only detached from his parents but believes he is immortal & can learn to do anything. What the true story lacks here is what he lacked in life. That is besides going to Alaska, he does not seem to have a goal beyond there.<br/><br/>Alex really does come off in this film as a tragic character who does not really think about others, being way too into his himself. This story does a very good job of going through why in pursuit of his goal of Alaska, he ignores all the opportunities & people who befriend him trying to make him fit into a normal life. He abhors normal life until ironically, at the end of his life he writes that there is no meaning to life unless it is shared.<br/><br/>The theme of this like Jack London's Call Of The Wild, is survival. The various locations used to film it are amazingly photographed. Stunning is the word I'd use for some of these locations. All the characters in the film are well drawn & unless you get bored easily, you should find something interesting in the way this film is made."

","Into The Wild. What an excellent film. I saw it back in 2007, and rewatched it to keep it fresh in my memory. It truly is a very beautiful and very personal film. Sean Penn is to be congratulated for pulling it off. His direction is superb, the cinematography and editing are excellent for the most part (at times they get a little bit too flashy, but just a minor flaw). The entire cast is superb. Catherine Keener is brilliant as always. Kristin Stewart is proving to be one of the most talented young faces. Hal Holbrook definitely deserved that Oscar nomination. He created the most touching character. The pain he went through seeing Chris making the mistake of his life, and their final scene together was simply the best scene of the film. I do admire Chris for setting out to do something that he believes in, but at the same time, one cannot help but think he is in over-his-head in this self- proclaimed pretension he has of living free and without barriers. He was an intelligent young man, but deeply misguided, and I do not believe Penn is in his side or against his beliefs. He made the film for the audience to either take this journey with him or take the journey into his own self-destruction. At the end though, Chris did learn from his mistakes, as can be seen with the line 'Love is only real when shared'. For that reason, this film is a true achievement. It is a sad and beautiful, but wrong, journey."

","First of all, this is NOT bad movie. However, it has to many flaws. ""Guy gets trough confusing teen period couple years too late"" would be shortest description of this movie and still it last more then two and half hours. Why so? Further more, there are characters totally irrelevant for the story. Directing is no good either. Mr Penn is obviously slave to clichés and is not experienced enough. But above all what is most problematic about this movie is point. There is absolutely no trace of it! One of the few good things in the movie is photography. Suma sumarum: if it wasn't this long it would be very much worth of watching."

","I have always been a fan of Emile Hirsch and thought he had amazing potential. This film finally put him in a role where he is able to carry a film and prove that he has the chops to be considered for an Oscar. Sean Penn does a fantastic job of translating the popular book onto the big screen while still capturing the true essence and character of Chris's story.<br/><br/>The film is an emotional ride as we have to meet and say goodbye to so many lovable characters at the expense of Chris's journey. The length of the film might be an issue for those out there looking for a ninety minute movie fix, but the acting and the message of the film help to carry it through."

","Sometimes you put a disc in the player and you're unsure as to whether or not you are going to enjoy the film coming up, despite numerous fantastic reviews. Into The Wild was one of those for me.<br/><br/>I needn't have worried. Within 10 minutes, I was glued to the screen, watching a fantastic story unfold before my eyes - and then it was over. The best movies have a tendency to do that. They immerse you with such force that you literally lose track of time, and this film is a fairly lengthy affair.<br/><br/>Most people will have questioned their existence at some point in time, I guess it's in our nature to do so - but not many will have gone to the extremes that the main character does - he quite literally goes through hell and high water, trying to prove to himself (and possibly to everyone else) that life is so much more fulfilling when you take a chance and break the mould - despite the motivations for doing so.<br/><br/>A true story, lovingly followed to the letter (literally) by Sean Penn and his ensemble of faithful cast and crew, Into The Wild is one of those movies, that despite it's not-so-Hollywood ending, leaves you with a reason to rekindle a little faith in humanity - and perhaps a tear in your eye.<br/><br/>I rate this at 8.2 out of 10. It's original, refreshing and utterly watchable - perhaps multiple times. Brilliant stuff."

","I personally draw a lot out of this movie. It is one of those movies which contributes to life- experiences that are as real as real-life and yet more meaningful than most of them.The movie is truth-'full' and eddie's vice in the background just adds to it. The anger at his parents and society in general that Chris fosters drives him to become a wanderer and he decides to go up north to Alaska to live in the wild, but on the way to the wild, I feel, is the real meat of the movie. The way the story is told is not new, but it seems the apt way. Beautiful Alaska!<br/><br/>Lovely characters, the peaceful SILENCE of the movie and the little meaningful conversations are the basic building blocks of this masterpiece. And Emile is brilliant.

"jazzbo32","7","1","2","21 January 2009"," A very pretty but unconvincing depiction of the life of Christopher McCandless
","Finally got round to watching this last night. I very much enjoyed the cinematography, the way the story was told and the locations that were shot for the making of the film. It looked beautiful, capturing very well the concept of what it is to be 'free' and to appreciate the natural world by comparison to our comfortable urban/suburban lifestyles. The photography at times was breathtaking and gave a real sense of how epic North America is and the contrast of landscapes within it's borders. The narration in the film and his own advice to himself and others I found to be heartwarming and thought provoking at times. I especially liked the idea of everyone having to measure themselves at points in their life to see if they are truly strong in body, mind and character. <br/><br/>There was a niggle that got to me throughout the film though, and it's probably only really based on my own prejudices and life experiences. I found it quite hard to sympathise with the main character, who seemed like a spoilt 22 year-old rich-kid that had read a few books and felt like he knew the world, imparting life-changing advice on unsuspecting hippies (and even a war veteran that had lost his wife and child in a car accident, arguably more learned than a well read college graduate???) along his journey. I'm not sure whether this part of the story has any basis in truth or whether this was an attempt by the family/director/writer to make his life and ultimate death seem more tragic/heroic/entertaining. <br/><br/>The basis for his rather melodramatic social self-exclusion seemed to be rooted in his parent's tempestuous relationship and his secret family history, which, in my eyes, amounted to nothing more than an angsty teenager sticking his bottom lip out, dismissing his family and extremely fortunate (albeit frustratingly pre-determined) education/career prospects and selfishly indulging in his own 'quest for adventure' without caring about the impact on his family. People in the world have to deal with much more horrendous things than their parents buying them a new car for their graduation and they do so, usually without torturing the people that care about them. It seemed as though his behaviour was validated by his intellect but again, I suspect this was a spin put on the film, orchestrated by his family, and acted out in particular by his sister, who's character narrates throughout. <br/><br/>The counter argument to this is that you are not necessarily supposed to sympathise with the main character. His lifestyle is questioned by the hippy woman who sees her own estranged son in him and by the old man who doubts Chris' claim that the basis for happiness is not in human relationships. The man, wise in his old age, doesn't bow down to this sentiment, instead proposing adoption. The protagonist's ultimate realisation of the flaw in his own argument however, comes when he scribbles, on his deathbed, the words 'happiness is only real if shared'.<br/><br/>So on one hand I enjoyed the lead's subversive attitude and determination to follow his own path, rejecting the ugly flaws of modern 'society' and the poetic critique of human nature but on the other, I was frustrated by the way his character was indulgently depicted as a Jesus-like figure, following an intellectual path to an enlightenment that superseded any concept of consideration for others whilst the film barely recognised the inevitable naivety and arrogance of upper-middle-class American youth.<br/><br/>On the whole I enjoyed the journey and found much of it very inspiring. At times I was deeply moved, particularly during the scene when he leaves the old man. A film I would definitely recommend to others, I'd award it 7/10. x"

","Like most films based on a true story, I expected this film to be slow-paced, and I was not surprised in any way.<br/><br/>Whilst the overall feeling of the piece is one of loneliness, I got the impression that the main character could and should have gone back home in the end. He stayed out there too long, in my opinion.<br/><br/>It was wonderful seeing all the people he met, and seeing how he affected their lives, and how, indeed, they affected his. But he didn't seem to learn anything from the people he met, apart from various trades and skills. If he'd only stopped to listen to them properly, he might have been happier than he ended up.<br/><br/>Enough about the character himself, though. The music to this film is terrific. Eddie Vedder, of Pearl Jam, wrote all the music, and did a sterling job, as usual.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is very good, and are directed well by Sean Penn.<br/><br/>This film really showcases the natural beauty of some parts of America, and indeed, the beauty of some of its people.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is sad, beautiful, yet boring. It drags on a bit, and because the subject matter hardly changes (ie a lonely man travelling up and down the country, meeting people) it is very samey. It's worth watching, but do not expect to take any important messages away having watched it, other than the importance of family and friends."
"GHCool","7","1","2","21 April 2008"," Grizzly Man was better
","I liked the movie mostly because of its performances, specifically the Emile Hirsch's and Hal Halbrook's. I thought Halbrook should have won the Oscar.<br/><br/>As for the controversy surrounding what the meaning of the film and of McCandless's death was, I'm going to go with the Alaskan rangers on this one and say that McCandless was arrogant and suicidal. His mom and dad didn't seem like the best parents in the world, but I have more sympathy for them and their loss than I do for McCandless himself. Thousands of young American adults grew up under worse circumstances than McCandless, but most of them don't die for a half-baked political statement that nobody is listening to anyway. <br/><br/>The thing that irritated me about this movie is how ambiguously it treats its main character. Throughout most of the film, it portrays McCandless as an almost Jesus-like figure. Indeed, during his death scene, the editor inter-cuts images of McCandless suffering from malnutrition with angelic camera movements of the sky/clouds as if McCandless is ascending to Heaven. On the other hand, in his final moments, McCandless seems to admit to himself (and the world) that he may have made a terrible mistake and most of the colorful characters he meets on his journey seem to agree that his extremism will get him in terrible trouble. <br/><br/>I much preferred Werner Herzog's documentary Grizzley Man which is about a similar true story of a man who that died while camping in Alaska. Herzog is less ambiguous on the point that his subject's life and death is a warning against defying common sense for the sake of idealism and is a meditation on the human condition and its place within nature. Penn's film felt hero worship for a man who essentially tied himself to a railroad track and expected the train to go around him."

","What a lush, beautiful, evocative film. The story and the performances -- from Emile Hirsch to Catherine Keener, Hal Holbrook, Marsha Gay Harden, William Hurt and Jena Malone to small players like Brian Dierker (as Rainey) -- came alive under the deft and unforced hand of screenwriter/director Sean Penn.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is one of my favorite nonfiction books of all time, and the story haunted me for months after I read the book. When I heard it was to be a film, I was both fascinated and worried about how it would translate to the screen -- particularly the inner struggles and thoughts of Chris McCandless that took him on his tragic quest, and the complex relationships in his life.<br/><br/>Penn really captured the rich tapestry of this story.

","That's what the movie hero writes in his diary in the end. This movie tells the story of a young man who after graduating in university with very high marks decides to abandon home, family and everything and go to live into the wild in Alaska like if it was his promised land. He is pushed into that not only but what they call the lies of modern civilized life and social hypocrisy but also because, thinking like that, he is particularly hurt by his parents lies about their past private lives. While the movie progresses we hear his sister's voice off stressing the most important moments and aspects of his life. In my opinion the message the movie wants to pass is that there is a mistake to show revolt against society by running away to live with Nature and alone. In his course to Alaska our hero (who walks and hitch-hikes all the time) stops sometimes here and there to get occasional works that can give him a little money to enable him to support himself on his course. In those moments he creates bonds of friendship and love with lots of people but always rejects any possibilities of staying with them in his stubborn march to Alaska where he wants to spend at least a great part of his life in contact only with Mother Nature. He leaves lots of people who have become very fond of him, very unhappy with his absence. Mother nature is not always paradisiacal and may also be very cruel sometimes and even violent. And for instance the wild food it provides can be poisonous. Adding to the movie's credit are the beautiful landscape images and the splendid background music and songs of the country type."

","When i first saw this fabulous movie with an all star cast (Emile Hirsh, William Hurt,Marcia Gay Harden, CATHERINE KEENER, Vince Vaughn, and the great Hal Harbrook- congrats on the Oscar nomination!) I was COMPLETELY blown away. From the amazing scenery, the sugary sweet moments and the great acting Into The Wild is truly one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. I have to say that even though Emile was great in his breakthrough role as Christopher, Catherine Keener was truly the one who blew me away. She played a married hippie Jan Burres who talked and gave shelter to the young and homeless Christopher- her scenes with her talking and sharing i guess you could say stories were amazing- she played this role with great subtlety- it was small yet very powerful! And when i saw that she was snubbed from being nominated for an Oscar i was shocked and saddened!- BTW why in the world was Sariose Ronan nominated for Atonement she was annoying and completely overacted her role as Birony Tallis- i was very disappointed to see that she was nominated and Keener was not!!

","I found Jon Krakauer's book to be a fascinating and sad study of McCandless, but the combination of Penn's screenplay, direction and a lead actor without the necessary talent/skills to convey McCandless' complex ideology resulted in a movie most notable for supporting actors' performances and stunning scenery. Unfortunately, Mr. Hirsch was unable to hold his own in scenes with Holbrook and Keener, who wiped him off the screen. Mr. Hirsch didn't even have to do the usual actor's homework of writing his/her character's autobiography; all he had to do was read Krakauer's book. So many literary layers were lost in translation to the screen, which resulted in deeply disappointing movie."
"jdesando","Null","1","2","3 October 2007"," A bit like us
","OK, I love to travel to places I don't know to connect with life's companion thrill, Nature (people being the major gift of existence). So I'm probably going to like Sean Penn's Into the Wild, which introduces us to a real-life peripatetic hero, Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsh), not an egomaniac like Werner Herzog's Timothy Treadwell, but just a brainy, 60's type hippy in love with Thoreau and decidedly not enamored of suburban life. We travel with him to his starvation death in a ""magic bus"" in Alaska, all the time aware that even this Emery grad may not know why he forsakes everyone for a death march into Alaska.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is the way Penn can indulge impressionistic inclinations by cutting frequently to small mise en scene details that represent rather than move the story. A bee pollinating a flower is a representation of Nature's endurance, a pair of rubber boots emblematic of the inelegant survival measures required to last in the northern wilderness.<br/><br/>The weakness is those very details, gratuitous addenda indulging the director's need for recognition among the artistic elite. For me they remain the impressions of a trip well taken, where the destination is not primary and the images and people along the way everything. Hal Holbrook's Ron Franz, a lonely old man befriending Chris, speaks of the need for family just as we do in our hearts, aware of how Chris has jettisoned his flawed parents and loving sister for an idealistic exit from this world in which some of his final written words are about being ""lonely."" <br/><br/>Jon Krakauer's best seller is served well here for those of us who long to see the landscapes his docudrama novel recreates from the hero's scribbling and his family's reminiscences, especially his sister, Carine's (Jena Malone). In the end, it's just Chris, and Penn, and us wondering if separation from society is a good thing. Penn avoids the answer and Chris's deepest motivations; he does provide a slow-moving, satisfying ramble with an engaging, self-destructive adventurer, who turns out to be a bit like us."

But otherwise film frustrated, it shows a man with future and great contribution to the world but being selfish and abandoning parents, sister, himself."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","7","23 May 2008"," overlong and precious, also marvelous cinematography and solid turn by Emile Hirsch
","Christopher McCandless, in a manner of existential terms, had it all really. He graduated from college, had $24 grand in tuition, and a possible future law career. He could do anything he wanted with his life. So, he followed his passions, mixed perhaps with some escapist connotation involving a wounded family history, and left on a solo trek across the 'wild' of America, eventually on a quest to Alaska. At that point, he used what little knowledge he had to live off the land, hunt for game, and be one with nature while camping out of an abandoned 'Magic Bus' vehicle. It's here that we see the story, told in a somewhat typical non-linear form, take shape around the intellectual scope of a quintessential Thoreau wannabe.<br/><br/>In Into the Wild, Sean Penn's treatment of this man- who, eventually, died of poison-cum-starvation- this is a quest that is made interesting by the people that Christopher (sorry, Alexander Supertramp) meets along the way, which include some hippies in a van (an earthy Catherine Keener one of them), a very young Joan Mitchell type (Kristin Stewart), and blue collar worker (Vince Vaughn), and the proverbial 'wise old man' (Hal Holbrook, easily my favorite of the lot). They help bring a human dimension to what would otherwise be a guy, somewhat but not quite disillusioned by a particular American society, walking around in a state of being that calls one back to the discussion between Jules and Vincent over 'walking the Earth' in Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Is he just a 'bum', or is a true risk-taker? Or is it just all, as Christopher at one point admits, for a possible future book to come out of this? These questions arise, and some others, as Penn tries to question himself what kind of audience is coming to see his film. Will they easily pass judgment on a kid in over his head and not prepared for full-blown saga out of Jack London, or as someone who sadly lost the good fight against all reasonable responsibilities as a common, law-abiding citizen? Luckily, Penn did cast just right for us to want to be with this character, as Emile Hirsch has the qualities of strength and vulnerability so that he doesn't make him unsympathetic (which, for this sort of character, could be easy to do), but keeps him grounded and strong and, simply, just right for the part in this context.<br/><br/>The only problems come with Penn, as a director, taking flights of pretentious fancy with his style. Part of the problem with taking on a tale of going out to nature is there's the tendency for the visuals to outweigh some of the narrative strengths. It's reminiscent more of his work on the Crossing Guard (though not as much), and there are some passages and montages and those chapter breaks and yellow words streaming across the screen that do mark it as original but not necessarily driving much with the story. If it's poetry he was looking for, it's not achieved with the utmost beauty or grace, despite the marvelous moments that he and his director of photography grasp the many landscapes. And, as the greatest asset, Eddie Vedder on the soundtrack- who's songs might even be better than the movie itself- compliment the nature of the character but also sounding fine as stand-alone songs or guitar numbers.<br/><br/>So, take a trip into this moral conflict that strikes up Into the Wild as a worthwhile effort, if not a masterful one, and see what it's like to be young and escaping and living life to the fullest, if not the smartest."
"cafranci","5","2","7","9 October 2007"," Could have been great
","I'll preface my review by saying that the film definitely has great moments and redeeming aspects, but I feel that Sean Penn focused too much of the story on the physical journey of Christopher McCandless and not enough on the relationships he has throughout the film. Having read the book I feel that the most important aspect of the story is how his parents' relationship affected him and how that in turn affected his relationships with all others. Especially because of the ending and the message it sends the viewer, I think the narrative structure could have benefited greatly from expanding on the relationships he developed along the way (and why they always ended with him running away from commitment and long term acceptance) and condensing the actual physical travel. I realize that the physical journey is a big part of Chris' story, but I feel that all the time dedicated to showing him travel could have been better spent developing who Chris really was. Sean Penn created an accurate portrayal of Chris' story, but at the end of the film we are still left wandering who Chris really was. The film also tends to repeat itself unnecessarily, showing Chris go through many similar traveling and reflecting situations as well as showing several short relationships that consist of not much other than Chris telling them that he's ""going to Alaska""."

","There is a certain irony to the story from ""Into the Wild"", as Hollywood, the land of excess, does a film about a man who got rid of all his possessions in order to live simply off the land. It would be like me (at 250 pounds) writing a diet book! Now I am not attacking Sean Penn or the film or any of the ones who made the film...but in general I just cannot associate Hollywood with the life of Christopher McCandless!<br/><br/>The story begins with Chris graduating from Emory University, a prestigious school in Georgia. Now you'd think he would be on the fast track to financial success...but instead he gives away nearly everything he has and heads into the wilderness to live a bit like a nomad. It seems Chris was tired of a life of acquiring things and wanted to live simply...and mostly alone. He also seemed to be running away from himself....or at least who he and his family were.
Ultimately his life would take him from the American Southwest all the way to the wilds of Alaska. This tale is based on a true story, as told by Chris' sister in the film.<br/><br/>I think this is a movie where I enjoyed the style more than the story itself. I liked the simple style, the simple music and the mostly lesser-named stars in the picture. I also respect how much Emile Hirsch put himself out for the role...his weight loss throughout the movie was dramatic. As a trained therapist, however, I couldn't help but think the Chris would have benefited a lot from therapy before taking such a huge leap in his life. He was clearly, in an odd way, suicidal and I was concerned how the film seemed to romanticize this.
Overall, an interesting but often unpleasant and overlong movie...worth seeing once but not a film I'd rush to recommend."

In addition to there was something to learn from his regret. He said ""Happiness is only real when shared."" and remembered his family in the last scene. I thought that we can't get true happiness in life alone, so I have to build a human relationship with family, friends and other people.

In Alaska, his final destination, he learns a lesson about happiness and comes to a tragic end.<br/><br/>As I said, the movie lets me think about Materialism. In our society, we can't live without things like money and everyday convenience like smart phones. I think we feel emotionally satisfied if we have them. McCandless throws away all his belongings including family, smartphones and money. However, he realizes he can't live alone and discovers the importance of things during his odyssey. Moreover, his tragic end emphasises his opinion about happiness.

","Happiness is best when shared. This is the lesson Christopher McCandless learned at the end, though that may have been too late. <br/><br/>His family situation may have driven him away, but his spirit, fueled by the writings of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and others, drove him forward, toward the west, then toward the north, into Alaska.<br/><br/>I don't think he merely seeked adventure on his journey, as the movie synopsis suggested, but believe that he also pursued truth, and went out into the wild to define true happiness. He also seeked freedom, from family, society, and societal constructs such as money. Only when he became desperate alone in the wild did he finally realize that other people—other humans—are part of what make him truly happy. <br/><br/>I do not know whether he died in sadness or happiness, knowing that he had figured out the truth for himself but that he was no longer able to pursue it. <br/><br/>I read the book as well, and think it sad that he gave up the search for civilization after confronting the river. Though he had much energy to seek out this adventure, he did not carry it out with full determination. He was set back by failures and defeats, such as wasting the moose that he killed and not being able to cross the river. <br/><br/>In fact, had he gone a bit farther down the river, he would have found a way to cross the river. Had he explored a little farther in another direction, he would have found a highway that could lead him towards help. <br/><br/>But he didn't. He stayed in the bus and gave up. That was the greatest tragedy of his life.<br/><br/>Some may say that he could not handle the stresses of life in civilization and at home, but if that were all that it was, he could have easily ended up in the streets and losing himself in drugs. He did not do that. Instead, he trekked the paths no others had been on before. He was a trailblazer. He lived a fulfilling few years in search of something that he believed in, and that is commendable.<br/><br/>Though the movie did not drive me to tears, I was more moved on the inside than possibly any other movie save Shawshank. A beautiful movie not only in storytelling and cinematography, but, more importantly, in the subtle message that only a careful viewer would be willing to digest. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to reflect upon my own life, and see the beautiful and mesmerizing power of nature as well as the danger of adhering too strongly to a book-based vision."

The young man who went to Alaska and eventually died from starvation had nearly all the knowledge he needed to survive.<br/><br/>In the end, he needed either food from animals or food from plants. One who will survive from the harvesting of other animals must continue to move, to follow the prey. One who will survive from the consumption of plants must cultivate and then harvest plants. He didn't plant and he didn't keep moving."

","I saw this movie when it came out, and at the time I really liked it. After a few years passed, I couldn't stop thinking about the movie. I read the books about the same true story. I became even more fascinated. I finally saw the film again, and enjoyed it even more the 2nd viewing and FIRMLY place it in my top 5 films in history (yeah I'm typically a mainstream guy ... Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Lord of the Rings are also in the top 5, but this one even shines above those in many ways).<br/><br/>The acting, directing, and adaptation of a true story are wonderful. The real settings (not some studio back-lot) are apparent. You are really brought along for the journey. There is something primal in all of us, and this movie points that out better than any other movie out there. While I can't say I will ever have a journey like the one in the movie, I can say that it is something of a fantasy to shed the shackles of ""normal"" lives and just go out into the world and really live. Chris McCandless really lived, and to some degree he will always be a hero and inspiration to me thanks to Sean Penn's amazing film."
"Navin_R_Johnson","Null","1","3","21 February 2017"," Great setup, but the ending doomed it...
","I read the book Into the Wild about 20 years ago and the story has haunted me ever since. I saw the movie about a year after it came out, and the first two hours were quite good. The screenplay was clever, and the direction and cinematography were both very good. However, I was ultimately quite disappointed by the way it ended.<br/><br/>Chris McCandless was a fascinating individual, but he was somewhat of an enigma. This movie was beautifully filmed and the detail of shooting on location was quite bold and gave the movie an authenticity rarely seen anymore. However, it ultimately failed to capture Chris McCandless. Instead we were presented with a two dimensional drifter who was conflicted about his parents and sought wisdom on the road. He is a modern day David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine, drifting from place to place and helping the locals make sense of their life. In the movie he found redemption but then died after making a tragic mistake.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie ruined it. The scene when he passed out after eating some plants, then awoke in a panic and discovered his mistake was simply laughable. After two hours of masterful film-making, we are clubbed over the head with an over the top melodrama. More than that, in a movie based on real life, we are shown an ending to the story as it never truly happened.<br/><br/>This movie was clearly made for those who did not read the book. The portrayal of McCandless in the book presents a complex individual. The people who knew him during his two years of wandering seem to have had a great deal of difficulty figuring him out -- he was full of contradictions.<br/><br/>The most haunting aspect of Into the Wild (the book) is this: what happened to him at the end? Why did he die? The book presents a hypothesis of poisoning which has been proved wrong. The movie presents a fantasy that he ate the wrong plant. The truth is much more intriguing. All we have are some scribbles in the margins of books and an incomplete journal which showed signs of desperation towards the end.<br/><br/>And by all means, please read the book BEFORE you watch this movie!"

Such reviews justify how impressive and captivating the delivery was. Perhaps, Chris, should have been a good boy.

"lise-74370","7","1","3","25 April 2016"," Best movie in the world
","The movie ""Into the Wild"" is a classic example of the modern-days' materialistic criticism. The main character goes against his parents' and the society's values, to live free and side by side with the nature. He burns his money, which shows that he is going against the materialism. Only to obtain the meaning of life, by finding true happiness. He writes, ""happiness is only achieved when shared"" which makes him sad, when dying alone.<br/><br/>The poem ""Composed During a Storm"" is about how the nature can be a cruel thing, but in the end the main character gets an epiphany, and experience the beauty of nature, which saves him. Which is also seen in the movie. <br/><br/>The poem ""Composed During a Storm"" is a great example of how this movie is not only a specific problem about this character but is a problem with the society we live in.<br/><br/>All around it is a good movie, with a little bit of lack of seriousness from the Danes, which makes all Danes look stupid."
"andersanders-36039","7","1","3","25 April 2016"," It is a story about a boy who needs to find his own identity.
","The movie was a good movie but confusing, because it jumped in time and that was hard to keep up with. In the story there is many subordinate character, who is very different from character to character, so it can be confusing. It was a very long movie and at the end it was tiring to watch. The movie has some threads to the poem ""Composed During a Storm"", as a man who has tumult in his soul, and he tries to find himself in the system. The movie might need some more action to make it more exciting, it is very prolonged, and often the same storyline. Our main protagonist is played by Emile Hirsch, who play the role perfect, with both happiness and sadness and his good reactions. The instructor is Sean Penn who also have made, The Gunman, Milk, Mystic River and this movie also one of the good one to his collection"
"gide-64377","8","1","3","25 April 2016"," Into the Wild Review
","I watched this movie in my livingroom, while sitting in my favorit leather chair with a cup of tea. The movie inspired me to think about what's important in life. Especially when I got to see how he developed and realized what he really wanted in life. The movie kind of reminds of the poem ""Composed During a Storm"", because of the simile in the wild nature and the protagonist fleeing from whatever environment he is in. However there is a contrast, because the protagonist in the poem tries to escape the wild nature, but Christopher in the movie escapes to nature, because he wants freedom, but he finds out that happiness only appears when shared. I really recommend the poem if you like the movie."
"daniel-83847","10","1","3","25 April 2016"," I r8 it 8/8, I though it was so gr8.
","This movie is very good, it has a very good symbolism and you get to feel the sublime effect of the amazing world. As an example, when Ron and Chris have climbed up the desert rock, they sit there and talk about god. Then the sun starts shining on the pale faces, and they start to laugh. This is where the sublime effect hits Chris and Ron and symbolises that god has his eye upon them. Even though the movie is very symbolism heavy, it has some funny moments. I.e. when we meet the Danes, sitting on the rocks grilling sausages and hotdogs(Not all Danes are like that). Due to the fact that they are in their own peace and harmony in nature, they are another example of what Chris is searching for - inner harmony with himself. That is what he finds just as he dies where he is looking at the sun. The way he finds the sun just as all seems dark, is a lot like in the poem ""Composed during a storm"" where the protagonist finds the blue sky in the middle of the darkness in the storm."
"henrikpsnielsen","9","1","3","26 May 2015"," Unapologetic Performance
","This movie is so well acted and -crafted that it does not deserve ten stars of excellence. It may seem contradictory at first but allow me to elaborate: The acting of Ronald Franz, the old man in this motion picture, who had no family of his own and who, lonesome and vulnerable, wished to adopt Chris McCandless; it was the most unapologetically true and striking performance I have yet to experience. His tears were my tears, his grief so. The left-back and never-to-see-again feeling all mine, too. So the quality of the acting turned out to be on the whole lineup. Steady and contrastive, but seamless. The craftsmanship was so well done that one forgets what these actors really are - that is - actors. The unapologetic performance and the true feeling turned only truer with their acting entirely. They acted so well that I came to judge them not on the performance criterion - as do I usually when rating movies from a range of criteria and then averaging to my final vote - no all criteria were at their maximum. They acted so well that I came to judge these actors not on their performance, but on whom they portrayed. And the parents with all their misdemeanours, and Chris McCandless - leaving behind his sister and Rob, and those homely and welcoming camping people with the woman who herself had not seen her child for years. It was heartbreaking. And it felt soulless and empty. Simply put: While this movie cannot be said to salvage what Chris McCandless did - but it may - and while it does nothing to defy this view, I cannot but assert that the people and the sort of true, erratic behaviour that led to this motion picture altogether, do not deserve the unapologetic and true ten of ten stars of excellence. That's how good this movie was. The honest truth of the narrative that led Chris McCandless to live an inane life was grieving and dull and I feel it nought to celebrate. Therefore only nine stars. Be it as it may, there need be many more of this sort of motion picture in the future."

","I didn't know what to expect, didn't read anything about the film prior to viewing except for the mini synopsis on DVD.<br/><br/>Emile's performance is one of the finest I've seen thus far.

If you think you are adventurous, I strongly suggest you go see this movie. When I found out that it is based from a true story, I knew I was in for a good ride.<br/><br/>There are very soulful moments within the film that were perfectly mounted to stir even the coldest of the heartless.<br/><br/>I rarely get emotionally involved but Emile's got my shoulders shaking at the earliest point of the story so I'd say that's how real it could get for me.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, Sean Penn did an amazing, impeccable job telling this story!

Just having the knowledge that this is someone's real life experiences makes me stop and think about all the beauty that we are all missing for getting attached to material things. For all things we are afraid of experiencing and for situations and people we didn't even give the chance to know. The way that Emile Hirsch got into the character is very strong, very believable. 140 minutes lined very perfectly.

"GeorgeRoots","9","1","3","13 October 2014"," Sean Penn Gives An Extraordinary Life A More Than Decent Tribute.
","""Into the Wild"", is a dramatisation of the unbelievably true story that shows the life of 24 year old Christopher McCandless (Who is amazingly portrayed by Emile Hirsch). Rejecting conventional life, the movie chronicles his journey into the wild in which he would sadly not return. But in those 112 days out there, he probably lived more than any other person glued to his screen or struggling to pay bills ever would.<br/><br/>Staying true to the non-fiction book by Jon Krakauer, and embellishing a little here and there. As he goes along his way he begins to learn more about life and meets a variety of interesting characters, built up by the movies impressive ensemble cast. Of course it's a reckless way to live, but the film wisely never judges. It really is an astounding work as true stories usually are. But just the fact that a person in his early 20's had survived that long with virtually no map or compass and just the open road, you can't help but be a little impressed.<br/><br/>What really makes the movie for me is the acting talent, surprisingly everyone complements each other and never underwhelms. Not only is Sean Penn a good actor, but also a very good director. Many of the large establishing shots really make the movie surprisingly intimate given McCandless and his journey. Finally when you have Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam fame providing your soundtrack, it's pretty hard not to be enticed.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Definitely one of 2007's more impressive pictures. 9/10."

","This is a thought provoking movie that makes me feel something different every time I see it. Haven't we all wanted to ditch our lives and responsibilities at some point and just go wander around? But this is also so much more.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsh does an amazing job here which often requires him to act without dialogue as he's alone. He just shows his fascination, hurt or frustration through his eyes. As a big fan of the book I can honestly say that this film adaption is just so well done in all aspects, you really get a feel for what Chris McCandless was trying to accomplish (?) by abandoning his life of luxury and privilege and shunning society on his quest to live off the land in Alaska.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed all the characters he met along the way (Hal Holbrook, Kristen Stewart, the hippie couple, Vince Vaughn) and all the amazing scenery.

"jantoniou","9","1","3","10 March 2014"," Lovely, pensive, thought-provoking...
","I have heard about ""Into the Wild"" for years and was pleasantly surprised to see it available on Netflix the other day. <br/><br/>When I started watching I knew I was getting into something special, made artful and powerful principally by the scenery, the limits of the words it chooses to use carefully (there's relatively little dialog throughout the movie) and the drama and depth of humanity that plays out in Emile Hirsch's fantastic portrayal of a young man who had the self-awareness and depth of character to take a very, very different path in life from where his parents and society expected him to go. <br/><br/>The romanticism of McCandless' adventure gets laid on pretty thick at times, but Penn, to his credit, pulls back at the right moments. I think we see that it wasn't all beautiful landscapes and luminous, contemplative starry- eyed obsessions with Thoreau and Russian writers. McCandless put himself in tremendously difficult and dangerous situations and had to do pretty mundane things to survive (like work actual jobs while he was tramping around). <br/><br/>The film has the peripatetic feeling of a Kerouac novel and is paced freely, bouncing between McCandless' final Alaskan adventure as the last set-piece for the movie, and his tramping all around the country, going from mid- Western wheat plains to the Southern California and Arizona deserts to coastal California and much of the forests in Oregon and Washington before heading to Alaska. <br/><br/>We get some insight into his family dynamic and the overdubs in the voice of his sister often serve as recollections of the truly painful history he had with his parents. If you learn more about the McCandless family and - hopefully not giving too much away - there is considerable controversy and debate over how and why McCandless starved to death in the Alaskan wilderness and also considerable debate about how his mother and father are depicted. <br/><br/>I think we can debate endlessly over whether McCandless was being arrogant and foolish for doing some of the things he did, but the movie does take some artistic license with the decisions he made. He may not have been quite as crazy as he is occasionally depicted but, regardless, his decision to head alone into the Alaskan wilderness as a largely green and an inexperienced outdoorsman could be thought of as an ultimately naive and ill-informed decision. But then if someone jumping out of a plane ends up dying we can think their decision daring and ill-informed, too. <br/><br/>Eddie Vedder's soundtrack is a perfect compliment to the movie and is much a part of it as the rivers, forests, and desert landscapes are. <br/><br/>""Into the Wild"" is, regardless of its occasional artistic license and perhaps occasional swoon of romanticism over someone who appears to be a true rebel, is truly a wonderful and powerfully thought-provoking film well worth watching."

"lamurakami","5","1","3","15 January 2012"," Good movie NOT of a hero
","In many ways ""Into the Wild"" is not about a trip to Alaska or into the wild as much as about a young man on his escape journey. I have watched the movie a few times because I live in Alaska and the movies connection to Alaska. At times I have utterly disliked it because he is unprepared for the wild and his Alaska wild ends up being in an abandoned bus a relatively short distance from a highway and hunting cabins with supplies. I dislike romanticizing suicide and suicide by stupidity even more. The parts of the movie before Alaska and the philosophic journey are sometimes a much better story until I question how much is fiction.<br/><br/>The portrayal is of someone who takes pride in surviving with a minimum of gear and funds, and little preparation but dismisses the fact that he is often fed or otherwise aided by people he meets on his travels. This person with an intense idealism and belief that he needs to live alone in the wild dies shortly after getting far enough away that others cannot help him.<br/><br/>Most of the time I join with most other Alaskans who have negative views about McCandless and those who romanticize his fate. His venture into a wilderness area alone, without adequate planning, experience, preparation, or supplies, without notifying anyone and lacking emergency communication equipment, was contrary to every principle of outdoor survival and, in the eyes of many experienced outdoor enthusiasts, nearly certain to end in an undesirable way. Enjoy the movie if you want to but please don't think of McCandless as a hero but as a victim of a tragedy caused by his own actions.<br/><br/>If you understand that a movie based on a true story may be far from a true portrayal of that story, and are O.K. with that, then you may very well enjoy this movie. Under no circumstances should anyone consider this story as a guide on how to live life.<br/><br/>I rated the movie with 5 out of 10 because I just can't decide! I would love this movie if it more clearly portrayed that McCandless at the very least had a lack of common sense in his approach to the wild. Maybe the outcome is that clear portrayal, I just can't decide!"

Not to write this review based on this perception, however, is to let down the person that inspired this story and to confess that I failed this movie. This has got to be the greatest story put into a movie I have ever watched. This could have been my own story if I have not chosen to run and delve into academia to escape the very things that drove Chris away from the university and civilization and into the wild. In the end it isn't what I didn't achieve in academic distinction in medicine in spite of my modest success but what I missed in not towing Chris's path that haunts me after watching this movie.<br/><br/>Each one of us would react differently to the movie but this powerful story will grip us and make us reassess our own values. Watching the camera zoom out in the final scene, we are caught searching our own souls and asking ourselves if we have the courage to do what this young man did with his life.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a perfect score of 10/10 not because of its stunning cinematography, sound, editing, the labour and the insight that motivated and went into making the movie and especially the great outdoor shots, but because it captured a story so effortlessly and passively you would imagine that the story just told itself without a script, a film crew and a director.

"CalieBrummer","10","1","3","28 August 2010"," Amazing movie, surprisingly just as good as the book.
","Into the Wild is one of the greatest films I have seen. The beautiful scenery, accurate details, excellent acting, combined with Eddie Vedder's contributions to the soundtrack only added to the powerful message of the movie. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie was how closely it paralleled the book. Krakauer's novel was so powerful and beautifully written, one would expect a movie based on the same story to fall short of it's written counterpart. Sean Penn failed to disappoint, and Emile Hirsch only contributed to the portrayal of Chris due to the fact that the two could be related they look so similar. One of my favorite parts of the movie was the scene in which Chris is having a conversation with Ron Franz and declares a valuable message: that ""You are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships. God's place is all around us, it is in everything and in anything we can experience. People just need to change the way they look at things."" This message was just as powerful in the book, and in this scene the brilliance of Sean Penn shone through. The relationships Chris built in the movie were wonderful in the fact that he seemed to distance himself from everyone, yet at the same time had an intense personal bond with people that were fundamentally strangers. My favorite encounter Chris had was meeting Ron Franz, and the lessons the two taught each other were beautiful and inspiring.<br/><br/>There are very, very few things I disliked about the film. One of the fundamentals of the book was the fact that seclusion such as the isolation Chris found in Alaska ultimately led to an examination of one's own soul, rather than a simple minded hatred of society. The book compares Chris to a modern Thoreau, whose journey into the wild led to not only a closeness to nature at its fullest, but a closeness to oneself and an examination of the soul. This did not come across clearly in the film, the focus was more on the adventure Chris found along the way. Although this was not a huge mistake to make, it would have been nice to see more of Chris' journals and personal ideals displayed at some point during the movie.<br/><br/>Though it is difficult to compare Into the Wild to another film, the strong personal ideals and adoration of the wilderness vaguely reminded me of The River Wild. Though the plots of these movies are completely different, the grandeur of the wilderness is reflected in both. Into the Wild shows a man discovering himself, while The River Wild portrays the bonds of family and the discovery of another not being who they seem, which is ultimately what Chris found to be the major flaw of today's society.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a movie full of joy, adventure, sadness, beauty, nature, devastation, intense happiness, and unforgettable wisdom. A beautiful movie unlike any other."

","I had been familiar with this story for awhile, but had never set time aside to read the book or see the movie. This week, however, the library was promoting novels about nature and I took the opportunity to pick up the book. I read it in one sitting. It was that type of book; one that touches you on an emotional level and makes you forget all of your surroundings. Tonight I watched the movie.<br/><br/>I've read some of the criticisms of Chris and I agree with many of them: yes, he did not know nearly enough about the wilderness to go on his endeavor and he would not have met his end had he heeded any of the advice of people more knowledgeable about Alaska. But what intrigued me about his story was not the 'how' of the adventure, but the 'why'.<br/><br/>The motive to escape his synthetic family is more apparent in the movie than in the book, but I think he would have still gone on this odyssey regardless of his damaged home life. He just could not handle the responsibility that went with the attachment to other human beings. You see that in all of the people he meets while on the road. He packs up and leaves whenever it gets too emotionally intimate. The saddest example of this is when Ron asks to 'adopt' him and Chris dodges his request. His reaction inevitably seals his fate.<br/><br/>His story would not have been possible to tell if it weren't for the people that he met on the road putting the pieces of his two year sabbatical together. For all these people to remember him so vividly and embrace him, he must have had some special qualities. It's tragic, however, that he denied all of these people from relating to him. He would only have his outlook on life shaped by authors such as Tolstoy and London. I think the lesson to take from his story is that although we may all want to shun the world we live in, we cannot prevent ourselves from connecting to other people. If we do we all end up trapped on some form of the same bus that was Chris' coffin.<br/><br/>You will notice that I haven't said anything about the aesthetics of the film. For me to focus solely on the emotions that the movie produced and filter out all its technical qualities should give you a clue as to how well this film is made."

","Where should I begin? I could begin by praising Emile Hirsch (and the rest of the amazing cast). I could praise how beautiful the film was. I could praise Sean Penns direction. Instead let's start somewhere else.<br/><br/>Let's start of by saying I stood ready with the hacksaw one hour into the film, the lack of character development, lack of depth and story development. The thing that stuck out was the fact that I felt NOTHING for any of the characters, I just couldn't relate to anyone. I didn't understand until the end why it had to be told that way, not skipping anything not jumping straight to the point. When the film changes gear and ups the ante. That's where the real story starts and it's during this one and half hour you truly get to know the characters and start to FEEL.<br/><br/>I admire Christopher McCandless for the journey he made, I envy him for his radical unlimited mind. In a world were money, capitalism and consumption is becoming an issue he set out to free himself from his parents and the world, live free from everyone and everything.<br/><br/>Christopher McCandless set out in the world trying to find himself and freedom - he made it."
"ptb-8","7","1","3","26 February 2010"," The Little Punce
","Sean Penn's film about Christopher McCandless who shed his college and suburban life for a fatal nomadic journey is a really disturbing and absorbing film. It is extraordinarily well made and acted by Emile Hirsch. However what struck and disturbed me more than anything was how cruel and self absorbed and selfish our hero behaved. He caused pain beyond belief to his well meaning parents and sister, he burned his money instead of giving it to a poor family who needed it, he squatted in self absorbed diary bliss, he rejected all advances of friendship that did not benefit his mood at the time, ... in fact a good moment to demonstrate how unconscious he was of anyone else's feelings is late in the film when he cajoles an old man to climb up and across a really rocky and difficult mountain blissfully unaware that the hike is physically beyond the old man. He simply has no clue to another person's feelings. So our hero does really silly and dangerous things in his Kerouac style adventure down rapids and on freight trains and hitching lifts and staying as he chooses... and causing heartbreaking grief for his family. I was appalled to find this was a true story and it is to Penn's skill as a film maker that the astonishing selfishness of McCandless' self absorbed pilgrimage is spelled out as clearly as it is. Our hero might have had some teen issues with his family, but the rejection and ignorance of their feelings is utterly vile. Only a rich white teenager could behave in such a rotten way believing in this self righteous bubble that his selfish quest is some misguided noble back-to-basics adventure. In a film of many great scenes the standout was his tortured despairing father collapsing on the road in the suburb where they still lived. The hurt this boy caused! the terrible agony of not knowing where he was, and this brat thought all that was OK because HE was on a selfish quest. Penn's film is a great one and an expose of the sort of ruthless inconsiderate cruelty one generation worries about for the younger."

","Like most readers of the Krakauer book, the news that a Hollywood production of this tale was in the offing made me feel something akin to dread. The book describes a troubled young man, perhaps a genius, who perversely has a life-changing effect on practically everyone he meets, but may have been, at heart, a misanthrope. Krakauer makes sure his reader is aware that, despite his meticulous research, we are dealing with educated guesswork. The plot synopsis on IMDb states: ""Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life."" This is simply wrong. The fact is these people were shaped by Chris, but failed to influence him in any fundamental way that would divert him from his ill-fated course. Why Chris did what he did is ultimately unknowable.<br/><br/>Sean Penn's triumph is to preserve that ethos. Yes, it is beautifully shot, has a wonderful soundtrack, and a host of character actors step up to the plate and give outstanding service. From the book, Ron Franz stays in the mind most, a man sleepwalking through life till he encountered Chris, whom he wished to adopt. That character takes a while to surface in the film, but when he does, Hal Holbrook inhabits him completely. As Chris's father, William Hurt shows just as he did in History of Violence that range and economy are his forte these days. We admire Chris for the strength of his convictions, the vitality he radiates, but there is always the urge to condemn, or at least finger-wag. He has the self-obsession of the true artist, and the hurt that creates in those around him is very real. Penn makes the brave decision to put this at the heart of his film, by having Chris's sister narrate his tale.<br/><br/>Imagine, if you will, that this young man had not died, but had been found by hunters alive but enfeebled, then nursed back to health. The tale of a young man who went to live in the wilds of Alaska but ended up poisoning himself would have been tabloid fodder. Chris McCandless would have been a figure of ridicule and public scorn. But he did die, and that is the price tragic heroes pay for their status. Still, like most people, I would much rather he were alive, to enlighten us on what he learned from his adventure.<br/><br/>It is a rare pleasure to have a film live up to a book. Penn's portrayal complements rather than mimics; I felt I got different things from the film, rather than merely re-visiting the book's pleasures. Comparisons with Grizzly Man are inevitable but in a good sense, both films focusing on the triumph of the human spirit in dark circumstances."

","Firstly, I want to point out that I had just finished watching this movie. It prompted me to register on IMDb and write this review. So that should mean something. Into the Wild is one of the most emotionally powerful films I have ever seen, and should be watched by adolescents and parents alike.<br/><br/>It is an adventure story about a dedicated spiritual pilgrim filled who learns his ideas of the world from the people he meets along the way to the great wilderness he seeks -- as well as all his favorite adventure novelists. He rejects material possessions and loves the life he is leading, but makes a key error in judgment. He claims to have had a good life, so all in all, the film cannot be looked at as a tragedy."

","Sean Penn is a great actor, a great director as well! ""Into The Wild"" is a real movie event for me. Nowadays the most of the films are so predictable, stupid, banal, lustrous, income concerned......The category ""The 7th Art"" has lost its sense, for that reason films like ""Into The Wild"" are so important, necessary for keeping the cinema alive! <br/><br/>This movie hypnotized me, set me free for a while, it was absolute delight for my mind, eyes and ears. Eddie Vedder's songs are wonderful, they have essential contribution to the movie impact on me. His songs are so real and sincere. Emile Hirsch looks so devoted to his role, great actor achievement.

","Finally had a chance to watch the critically claimed Into The Wild.I kinda liked it but I also have mixed feelings regarding the story and the way it has been told.The movie which is based on real events,tells the story of Chris McCandless,played by Emile Hirch, a college graduate who rebels against society and its restrictions and despite having great grades,instead of enrolling in an university, donates his savings to charity and decides to live in the wild.His final destination is Alaska and along the way Chris meets a series of characters who shape his life.Some of them also learn from Chris and gain a new perspective on life.Its interesting to watch Chris's adventure but I would have liked to learn more about his beliefs and motivations.At some point in the movie Chris speaks about society and people in general,giving his opinion and discussing certain aspects of life and that was one of the most interesting scenes. That should have been explored a bit more so that as a viewer we could really understand what was going on trough his head and where he was coming from.We're told that his parents relationship which he considered fake was one of the reasons that led to his rebellion, he just didn't understand all the lies and became frustrated but it could not be just that, Chris had to have some very strong views about society otherwise he wouldn't just abandon everything and that's what I think would be interesting to know. Another complaint I have is, at some point in his journey Chris meets Tracy Tatro,played by Kristin Stewart, and they become very close(or so it seems).When Tracy gives the indication that she wants to sleep with Chris, he says he can't do it because she's a minor and it is against the law.Here we have someone that is rebelling against society and who is all about freedom and enjoying life, and when it comes to the most natural act between two people that love each other,sex, he refuses to do it because of the law? Something that society created? I just thought it was completely out of character.Apparently the real Chris and Tracy weren't atracted to each other but if Sean Penn is going to make it look like that he should at least make the scene consistent with the character's beliefs.Having said that, the film is beautifully shot,Emile Hirsch is great as Chris and so is Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz, one of the characters Christ meets in his journey and probably the most memorable one.I didn't love the soundtrack but I can't deny it suits the movie.Into The Wild is a film that really makes you think about your life,about happiness and its meaning,about our ""journey"" on earth and its a film that deserves to be watched.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Personally, I think Chris was crazy to do what he did and also it was very cruel of him not to at least call or write his family so they knew where he was. Shortly after graduating college, Chris decides to give away his money and go on a road trip without telling anyone. His car gets washed out in the desert and from that point he walks everywhere. He lives off the land and gets a little help from others by hitchhiking. He travels everywhere and gets a job driving a tractor to make a little money for his quest to Alaska. He also meets two hippies a couple of times who help him. He breaks this old guy's heart by leaving since he was his only friend. Chris also takes a journey in a kayak all the way to Mexico. He finally ends up in Alaska and stays the winter in the wilderness. When he tries to leave, the river has flooded and he is stuck. Chris meets his demise in the wild due to eating poisonous plants.<br/><br/>He wrote down most of his journeys so that is how his family was able to piece together what he did after leaving them. I thought it was sad for his family since he never called them. He may have been angry with his parents but considering what he did, I don't think he's a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>There was nothing great about the acting. Only the outdoor scenery was about average. Otherwise, not a whole lot happens in the film.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I guess if you like backpacking and camping, you may find this movie more appealing; however I didn't think it was that great. Not enough of a plot for me."

","I have to comment on Into The Wild because I feel so sad after watching this film for the 2nd time. This story explores thoughts that I think we all have once in a while: What would it be like to just leave and get out of here? Do we really need all these ""things"" that surrounds us? Emile Hirsch, the supporting actors (especially the father because of his character's development in the movie) and Eddie Vedder's music are just wonderful elements in a film that has a more natural and interesting flow than most Hollywood productions and really touches on something important! This is a glimpse into freedom and a great reminder. Makes you wonder if you are really doing what you want to do with your life.

","First, this is a great movie and I think should be seen by everyone. Now, i am a little disturbed at people who talk bad about McCandless. This guy was not an idiot. He grew up in a family that had many problems and when Chris was old enough he decided he wanted to do something in his life that was different than most. He was going out to have a ""spiritual revolution"" as stated in the movie. He wanted to live off the land in Alaska, with no modern provisions. And, I am sure it was not an attempt to have a movie made about him. To me this guy is a hero. He is someone that most of us strive to be and will never be. He was a man that adventured out on his own, had a hell of a time and made a mistake that cost him his life. And it could happen to any of us if we were to try what he did. But, I have more respect for him than anyone and would have loved to known him as a friend. He ventured out and made something of himself and had he not died, he would have came home a new man, ready to move on from the past disaster with his family. So keep bashing him if you like, but you are the jealous ones that live your miserable lives, regretting not doing something outside the box to make you a better person."

Being the first time that i watched a creation of Sean Penn, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, and to be honest neither were the others who were watching the movie with me.<br/><br/>Into the Wild tells the story of a young graduate living in a high life society who escapes the comfort of his parents materialism and goes on the road to discover new places and most importantly, to live a new life. On his journey he meets hippies, farmers and much much more. As time flies by, he becomes more and more independent of money and builds up to his ultimate goal: To reach the high grounds of Alaska and live with and off the wild.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a complex movie supported by a great cast, great scene of photography and a compelling story. It is a film which will leave you thinking, trying to find the true message Sean Penn was trying to insert into our heads. This is where Into the Wild truly shines, because there is no clear message. It is the audience which can decide the cause of the what,where,why and when. Sean Penn has created a masterpiece which allows us to establish the basis of the story and have it represent our own thoughts.<br/><br/>Beware tho, this movie is quite long (140 minutes) and to truly enjoy, you must not question the realism of the film, you must embrace it and only then will you find your own message and conclusion to the movie.<br/><br/>Into The Wild receives nine stars out of ten from me.

","Director Sean Penn will have been delighted by the controversy and debate this film has created. Yet its flaws are also its strengths.There are many unanswered questions- about central figure Chris McCandless's reckless behaviour in Alaska and his handling of his relationship with his sister and family in particular.These criticisms miss the point.<br/><br/>Penn has created an episodic exploration of ""untamed"" America which need only be taken at face value. What remains are images of a great wilderness and vignettes of life's highs, a brief chance meeting with a Danish couple in the Grand Canyon, and it's lows, a beating by railway security.It encapsulates the loose Everyman desire to commune with the wild,discover the beauty and truth of nature, and eschew life's materialistic trappings.No individual could possibly satisfactorily represent all those emotions, and McCandless, wonderfully played by Emile Hirsch, doesn't.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is a doomed quest. A tragedy that seeks, and attempts to illuminate, some truths about human existence. The extent to which it succeeds is down to the viewer, not the Director.Sometimes the pace is so slow that proceedings come to a graceful halt.Yet these halts serve merely as a coda, for the next meting with a stranger, and for the next sunset.<br/><br/>For those bored with formulaic blockbuster fare this is a welcome diversion, for others this will be a frustratingly slow and long exercise in achieving very little.You decide."
"ruthierocks","9","1","3","28 November 2008"," Beautiful film by Sean Penn. Excellent performances and a great story.
","Into the Wild is the heartbreaking story of a young man, fed up with society and his parents hypocrisies, who decides to make it on his own with nothing but the clothes on his back. Based on the true story and book by Joe Krakauer, Sean Penn adapted the screenplay and directed this lovely film. Sean Penn, who has proved over and over that he is an excellent actor, proves here that he also has talent in the directing area. Into the Wild is a great film and it does, in my book, rank up with some of the best of 2007. The acting here is wonderful all around and there is obviously much heart in the film. It's something I'd recommend to both film buffs and the average moviegoer. Into the Wild truly is a beautiful film that has something for everyone.<br/><br/>Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch), a recent graduate of Emory University, is fed up with his parents (played by Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt). They are too concerned with material items. They haven't really loved each other for years. They've lied to their children about their past. Chris is tired of it. Instead of coming home, he decides to get the most out of life by backpacking through the country. His destination is Alaska, where he plans to live off of the land, just be ""in the wild."" Chris changes his name to Alex Supertramp and begins his journey. The film is narrated by Chris' sister Carine (Jena Malone) and by his own journal writings. Carine, who still lives with their parents, gives insight into their past, telling what happened to make Chris feel like he did. His journal writings provide insight into his adventures in the wild, such as how he eats, how he feels, and every thought in his mind. The film also shows his journey to the wild, which include paddling down a dangerous river illegally, meeting a hippie couple and spending some time with them, and hitching rides on open train cars.<br/><br/>The acting here is superb, especially by Emile Hirsch in the lead role. This young actor has a lot of potential. I've thought that since his outstanding performance in the weak Alpha Dog a few years back. This is new heights for him, though. He plays Chris in a way that makes the audience feel for him and genuinely like him as a person. It's a great portrayal. Other highlights include Catherine Keener and Brian H. Dierker as a hippie couple, Vince Vaughn in a role unlike anything I've ever seen him play, and Kristen Stewart in a small role as a girl Chris meets along his journey. It's an excellent cast and no one seems out of place here.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with Into the Wild is a minor one. The film seems to drag on for quite awhile longer than it really should have. Its two and a half hour running time may have been cut down by about fifteen minutes pretty easily. That would have also tightened the film up quite a bit, making it perhaps even better than it is. This is a small complaint, though, and barely takes anything away from this wonderful film.<br/><br/>Sean Penn obviously has a bright future in directing. This is not his first time directing, and hopefully will not be his last. He seems to be able to get the best out actors and the emotion conveyed in the film seems very genuine and real. It's obvious in watching the film that Penn has a real passion for what he was trying to do with it. With excellent performances and beautiful scenes, Into the Wild is easily becoming one of my favorite movies of 2007. It is an excellent character study and, whether or not you know the true story of Chris McCandless, it is a rewarding experience and a two and a half hours well spent.<br/><br/>9/10"

But what it also ultimately shows us, is that humans do need company. Even those who barricade themselves in their rooms and think they're better off alone ... aren't. There's always someone near you (not really tough, when you consider the world population), so that might drive (some of) us, into wanting to be alone, but ultimately that wish will never happen and maybe deep inside those people know it and that gives them comfort, while they think they are alone.

Legends and stories and songs can transform a person into an idea...""by all accounts Jesse James was a cold blooded killer...and not the robin hood he's been portrayed as."" You could argue that Chris was a fool that he was to proud to take help from anyone, and that his pride killed him.<br/><br/>But that's not what the movie was about. The movie was about the idea...idea's are perfect people aren't. The idea of people are always more perfect than they really are.

","I just rented this film on DVD and saw it for the first time today. What a wasted life! Yes, I realize that he had ""Toxic Parents"" (book by Susan Forward) but other children have had worse. His sister suffered in the same home environment and survived. Chris McCandless was an intelligent, healthy young man but so lacked common sense that he put himself in a situation which killed him in a most cruel manner. He could have died many times along his reckless journey, starting with the flash flood (I was 14 when I saw my first flash flood). He could have died in the Colorado River rapids (no helmet, no experience!), riding the rails, or wandering on skid row.<br/><br/>If he wanted to get his head straight, he could have kept the 24 thousand dollars to finance a spiritual journey across the back roads of America, meeting people and figuring out life. He did some of that while he worked on the farm. The problem is that he had a hatred of materialism (which seemed to drive his parents). By trying to eliminate all aspects of society, his chosen economy de-evolved from industrial, to agricultural, and finally to hunter-gatherer. That life is hard and requires special knowledge passed on from generation to generation.<br/><br/>I have 16 years of backpacking experience and am very aware of both the beauty and the danger that exists in the wilderness. The author of Into the Wild, Jon Krakauer, is an adventurer himself and knows the subject. He also wrote Into Thin Air. In both books, foolish decisions lead to tragedy in the wilderness. If a person decides to explore such places, they need to be prepared, not just with equipment but with knowledge. Some of that knowledge can be gained from books or other people, but experience is essential. That experience shouldn't be gained from a first ambitious trek. You need to take baby steps. Learn your limits and try out your equipment in a safer environment. Chris talked to the experienced hunter but I think the moose was the first animal from which he tried to preserve meat.<br/><br/>One also needs knowledge of the specific wilderness. I think at one point in the film he realized that the river was higher than when he first crossed it in the winter because the snow on the beautiful Alaskan mountains was melting. People who live there know these things.<br/><br/>If you want to see an excellent film about another idiot who actually survived alone in the northern wilderness, watch Never Cry Wolf. I never backpacked alone.<br/><br/>It was hard to give this film a score. In general, I considered this film to be very well done but the subject is depressing. I probably won't watch it again. I am aware of the accusations that the film, and perhaps the book, deviated from some facts (http://www.tifilms.com/cw-sub/debunked.htm).<br/><br/>Chris was a city boy who probably thought he was smart enough to survive on the road or in the wilderness after graduating from Emory. You could almost say that he died not from starvation but from resentment of his parents, hubris, and irrationality. Darwin was right."

","Into the Wild is a superb, trotting, wonderful tale that deserves to be on every inner-adventurer's shelf. The settings look exquisite and all the environments are perfectly place in the film. It just feels right to see young Emile Hirsch in these locals. The plot is slow, but gripping; if the male lead wasn't so compelling, who knows? Speaking of him, Emile Hirsch makes the film what it is. His versatility, complexity, and flexibility in this role makes it all natural. With his smirk-laden smile, he treks across the country, with excitement. I really wish he would have got nominated for an Oscar. Another actor worthy of prestige is Vince Vaughn. Yes, the Vince Vaughn from Wedding Crashers. He is incredible. Maybe his same quick tongue average Joe is the same in every film, but he is the master of it. Great actors add to the great cinematography and direction. <br/><br/>Into the Wild is a great film, albeit, long film that is better to watch with company."

I would call the Hal Holbrook character the bridge between the two stories and ultimately the light that shines down on the main character. The interaction between the Holbrook character and the main character will lead the viewer to ultimate judgment on the main character. I myself leave the film angry and disappointed in the main character, but others may not. That is what will make this film one the best of all time. People will discuss the main character's actions and thoughts and can come out in two very different destinations.<br/><br/>I scored the movie a 9 out of 10.

That sort of 'plot' is going to be so absorbing. <br/><br/>But I thought 2 scenes were especially noteworthy<br/><br/>The first was when the old man asked Chris if he could adopt him. How sad and touching.<br/><br/>The other was when Chris declined to have sex with the 16 year old girl because of her age. Given the morals of Hollywood, that was almost unprecedented. Just consider the types of pairings of lovers in movies:<br/><br/>1) the most common is 2 singles, followed by<br/><br/>2) one married, the other single, followed by<br/><br/>3) two people, each married, but to others, then lastly, almost non-existent... <br/><br/>4) a married couple."
"maurin","9","1","3","9 March 2008"," A note about its directing
","The story does not need a summary beyond its title and tag line. Casting and performances are superb and moving. Another precious standout is the director here - rarely has a non-chronological storytelling felt more natural and flowing than here. Often, when directors resort to playing Chronos, the end result is a disjunctive narrative. Not in this case. The going back and forth between the final destination and the journey that led to it lets the story unfold without making it feel tired or restrictive. One could argue we do the same, when in the final destination of the present, constantly go back to revise different points of our past. The movie is presented in a similar organic super apple way."

My expectations were met immediately and all the way through. The striking beauty of this movie is already worth watching it.<br/><br/>Sean Penn really loves his main character and the film very much focuses on him (of course), which can become a little too much at times. But the ending is fantastically directed. The film appeals to everybody who wants to break out. Many people dream of it - very few do it.

Emile Hirsch gives one of those ""career defining"" performances. The rest of the cast was quite good. Hal Holbrook has a small but very touching part. What impressed me about the film overall is the excellent story telling. Sean Penn found a way to make the story compelling by using different voices to narrate the story. My major question is ""Why was this not nominated for Best Picture?"". I would say it is a better film than Michael Clayton or No Country. I wonder if it was hurt by the way it challenges contemporary social and cultural values? Of course one could just resort to saying that Chris was ""crazy"" but that doesn't really address the fact that he tried to live a life based on complete integrity without compromise. An inspiring story, a heroic tale? A great film."

","The important thing to consider here is that Chris McCandless is not portrayed as a role model. He has some right ideas, but he's clouded by his unique perspective which works as a customized filter. He proclaims himself to be a truth seeker, and yet interprets events, as each of us does, based on his life experiences and his immediate level of awareness.<br/><br/>Only at the end and when it's too late does he see from a higher view. Especially effective towards the end is the scene with the bear..I say no more.<br/><br/>In spite of much of his wrong-headed thinking, we see the causes through the glimpses we are given of his family upbringing.

","The funny thing about Into the Wild was that I didn't realize how immersed in the movie I was until I left the movie theater. Walking right onto a busy city street from the secludedness of the theater, made it remarkably obvious just how well this movie gets under your skin. The impressively authentic performances coupled with the breathtaking cinematography captured me to a degree where the outside world seemed unreal for a second. Then you see people hurrying on minding their own business and you quickly remember what's real. I challenge anyone with a bit of a dreamer in their stomach not to want to pack up their stuff and take on the world after seeing this movie. And thats the real strength of this movie; It leaves you with a feeling of nostalgia, sadness and an appetite for adventure all at once. Highly recommended."
"rhinocerosfive-1","7","1","3","28 January 2008"," Sean Penn takes things too personally
","Let me start by saying that this movie bored me utterly for an hour, but by the end I was bawling my eyes out, making noises like a little girl watching her brother tear the heads off her dolls. This is much more a testament to Sean Penn's script, and to the weight of the well-orchestrated cascade of editing choices in the final fifteen minutes, than to his overall directorial guiding hand.<br/><br/>This is, however, by far the best directing job by this director. When you let Sean Penn direct the movie you're going to watch, what you get (most of the time) is a very well-cast, well- (occasionally over-) acted, badly-lighted, indifferently written, not very well-directed American student film. (The American student film is definable as a combination of questionable taste and a linear story progression.) The coherence, the very point, of a Sean Penn movie is always in question, probably because Sean Penn is so much an artist that he feels too deeply to be as much a craftsman as is required of a director. He loves every single element with the same fervor, which is okay for an actor, since he's not in charge of the whole show. But a director has to make more choices than an actor has to make. A simple problem for which there is no simple solution. Notice that competent but less torturously gifted actors - Clooney comes to mind - make an easier transition to directing American movies. You gotta be free.<br/><br/>So this movie is even more of a surprise, because by about the hour ten mark it starts to break away from its restraints of theme-hammer and moral-tong. Soon it is just a road movie. The protagonist, and much of the first hour, in a strange retroactive way, begin to make sense as simply aimless journeys in and of themselves. This may be simply a happy marriage of Penn's tendency to defocus, or it may be intentional. But it is a glad thing.<br/><br/>And the construction of the final sequence proves that if he really needed to, Penn could direct ON GOLDEN POND type Hallmark movies for a living and never go hungry. I do not mean this as an insult, not at all. But I suppose he might take it that way."

","Into the Wild<br/><br/>I admit, I wouldn't have been aware of this film if it were not for the Soundtrack, which was appropriately penned by Eddie Vedder, who I am a longtime fan of. <br/><br/>There's nothing groundbreaking or deeply unique about 'Into The Wild', but that doesn't matter too much, because the film in itself is quite staggering, especially as it was based around a true story (and from what I've read), the film doesn't stray from the realness of what happened to Christopher McCandless -- our protagonist who is in search of himself and as he puts it to his friends & associates (I'm missing out family for a reason) his; ""great Alaskan Adventure"".<br/><br/>Apparently Director Sean Penn followed the footsteps and journey of McCandless before embarking on this artistic independent picture. In short, Christopher McCandless graduates his college education with excellent results, a promising future and selfishly throws all his parents help back at them (donates $24k of funds to oxfam), by quitting life -- literally and attempting to travel by whatever means; river, road, freeloading trains & foot, from one end of America to the next. <br/><br/>Along the way of course, he meets many characters who help colour the story and help illustrate McCandless determination to live his dream and at the same time breaks their hearts.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want to reveal everything about this film, but if you do check it out I can't imagine anyone not being impressed by the staggering cinematography, acting & old fashioned story telling that is neatly outlined by Eddie Vedder's bittersweet folk songs.<br/><br/>~Paul Browne."
"mlevens1","8","1","3","24 November 2007"," Lives up to all its hype
","A very good picture; an impassioned job by Sean Penn. Emile Hirsch is achieving better roles now with such movies as ALPHA DOG (2006) and this. Hirsch has all the ability to become one of the top actor's of his generation. While this is not what you'd call an ensemble cast movie  there are many talented actors: William Hurt (a favorite of mine), Marcia Gay Harden, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Hal Holbrook  and the great but unknown Brian Dierker.<br/><br/>The actual story of Christopher J. McCandless is a heart-wrenching one  or to be more specific, the story of his demise in Stampede Trail, Alaska at age 24. McCandless was not an idiot or a moron for starving to death 20 miles from a highway  I believe, at least from this adaptation (I haven't read the book) that he must have been struggling with a undiagnosed mental illness. His giving $24,000 to charity  all but $500 of his money, his burning the other $500 (literally) later on, his changing his name to ""Alexander Supertramp"", his immense activity accomplished with little food and sleep  only seems to suggest mania, meaning it is possible McCandless was suffering from bi-polar disorder.<br/><br/>This reminded of a book which I read some time ago, called ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE: AN INQUIRY INTO VALUES. They haven't made Pirsig's book into a movie yet  this would be a challenging undertaking. Pirsig travels from Minnesota to California on a motorcycle with his son, all the while having philosophical discussions in his head. This was an excellent, excellent book. Anyone who liked this movie would like Pirsig's magnum-opus.<br/><br/>But this was a very good movie. See it, please."

","""CHRISTOPHER REALIZED THIS WHEN HE WAS DYEING ..... HE REALIZED THAT THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS IN HIS LIFE WERE THE ONES HE SPENT WITH THOSE PEOPLE HE MET DURING HIS JOURNEY .... "" The above comment was posted on this site, and seems to be the feeling of many. I'm curious how we know that this statement is true. How do we know that Chris definitely learned that happiness means more when it is shared. Do we know this simply because he underlined that passage in a book he was reading? If he really learned this, why did he not leave a special note to his parents or to his sister or to one of the people who befriended him on his journey as Alexander Supertramp? <br/><br/>Another question or thought - Chris packed up and was ready to leave the wild on July 8th. I wonder if the reason he was leaving was because he was and had been starving. Did he feel his physical strength slowly deteriorating due to lack of proper nutrition, cold nights zapping his energy, physical exertion higher than caloric intake and decide that he better head back to civilization. Otherwise, why would he leave at the very peak of good weather and long hours of sunshine, plus better food gathering? Why would he not have waited to leave for a few more weeks and really enjoyed this best of times in the wild unless he was not feeling up to it? Just wondering if Chris left it too late, at July 8th, to leave the wild with any hope of survival.<br/><br/>The story is extremely compelling, but has certainly left me with a lot of unresolved questions. Like, was it Chris who destroyed the contents of the cabins that were located several miles from the bus. Evidently the damage was done in April of that year. Who else was around there at the time? It has been ascertained that the damage was not done by bears. If it was Chris, what was his state of mind?"
"richard_sleboe","8","1","3","30 October 2007"," A lot more than he needed
","By graduating from college, Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) pays his dues to society and, more specifically, to his by-the-book family. But since all social promises are false and all families are psychotic, he sees no other choice but to leave his old life behind, Bobby McGee style. Interludes at the hippie front and a stint at small-town happiness as a junior craftsman remain nothing but stopovers on a journey all his own. Not a lot of scripts could get away with lines like ""When you forgive, you love, and when you love, God's light shines on you"" or ""Happiness only real when shared"". Sean Penn's screenplay does. Think ""The Go-Getter"" meets ""Grizzly Man"", with overtones of Philippe Lioret's ""I'm fine"". Fine performances all around. Seeing a slick beauty like Catherine Keener in the part of a grief-ridden hippie is particularly refreshing."
"bobbobwhite","7","1","3","10 October 2007"," Like Grizzly Man in his naive love of wildness
","A disturbingly interesting film directed by Sean Penn, and very true to the original book. We all can relate to the true story lead character Chris McCandless(he changed his name to Alexander Supertramp for his sojourns), innocent, naive and youthfully stupid as we all were at that age, expecting the whole world and it's peoples to be our friend and nurturer and helpfully allow us to create a personal Utopia. Sadly, when we finally grow up, we see life doesn't turn out that way. It's filled with a lot of hard work and compromises, which we start to see realistically somewhere in our mid-20's or so. Alex didn't get old enough to see that truth, as he and Grizzly Man met the same fate due to poor judgement coming from just being young and dumb, and not seeing that their youthful utopian world view must be adjusted, compromised and modified greatly in order to live successfully later on in this world. Even most 60's hippies(the smart ones) who did the same vagabond thing saw that eventually. It seems to be human nature for the young to never seem to gain much insight from the previous generation's experiences even though they are basically very similar down through the ages.<br/><br/>Just like those 60's hippies, Alex hit the road as a vagabond and fell into many interesting adventures with oddball characters along the way. The story had all the usual trite causative and motivational bells and whistles behind it....bad parents(bad I guess because they were rich and successful)who did fight a lot, a cloyingly close sister(Hmmmm)who narrated the story, a liberal college degree, and no money problems at all growing up that may have protected him from the more practical world and life views of the less fortunate.<br/><br/>Thus the eventual Supertramp wanderer developed a serious hate of our capitalistic system(anything better out there?), and decided to live his life as a road tramp, working temp only when he needed the hated dollar in order to live and travel, and eventually get enough savvy and $$$ to get to Alaska where all the best things in life resided(in his mind)........beautiful scenery, wilderness, living off the land, no people, no need for money.........but also, 45 below zero winters, little natural food, no sufficient shelter(an old, uninsulated school bus in the middle of nowhere?), no one to talk to or love(he seemed asexual anyway), flooded rivers hemming him in so he couldn't go anywhere else much of the time. As he went to Alaska mostly unprepared for anything bad that could happen, it's too bad Chris didn't see a film like this one to discourage him before he went there and paid for for it with his life.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch did a great job in the role of Supertramp, as he had the air of innocent confidence that Chris obviously had in order to undertake such a journey. Also, great road characters abounded in the film story, with Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook showing off as, respectively, a funny and sympathetic South Dakota farmer... a loving, aging hippie vagabond and flea market rat.... and an old desert-rat retiree who developed intense fatherly feelings for Chris and knew that Chris was headed for a bad ending. All helped and cared for Chris along the way as he prepared for his great and final Alaska adventure. The film had many beautiful scenes throughout of skies, deserts, rivers, mountains, tundra and ......of course......beautiful, but deadly Alaska for the unprepared.<br/><br/>I read the book so I knew the ending..... and just as in Grizzly Man, a lot of naive and emotionally-driven mistakes can get you killed, even if they seemed good at the time. Penn showed all of this well in his film and I recommend it, but don't go if you want a feel-good Hollywood ending, as it definitely does not have it."

","I gave this movie a 7 (instead of an 8) due to the length. This movie would have been just as good if they had chopped about 30 mins off the length. Other than that, I liked what Penn did with it, and I understand this movie is ""based"" on someone's life - which is based on others' interpretations.<br/><br/>My wife read the book, and when she explained the gist of the story to me my first thought was that very few in our (USA) society today are prepared to 'live off the land.' We're just not brought up that way. We require a certain amount of (potentially specialized) training and teaching before we can free ourselves from the spoils of progress.<br/><br/>The fact that he died is no surprise. Many people prepare well to do what Chris did, and they die anyway. Had Chris survived, I would not consider him a hero, but rather, very lucky. He needed to go out and find himself, or his life, or whatever. But he didn't need to die doing it. He just didn't give himself very good odds.<br/><br/>Other than the length, my wife and I both enjoyed this movie. mikey."

","When I heard this movie was being made, and then later, heard it was being made by Sean Penn, I cringed at the prospect. The story of Chris McCandless is a sad, almost incomprehensible one, that simply fell into the hands of a very capable writer in Jon Krakauer. In some ways, Krakauer single-handedly developed the controversy of Chris' life that made the story so compelling. It's not surprising that a Hollywood hothead like Sean Penn would come along and make the story his baby. But, of course, I can't blast Penn too much, since he is clearly a talented actor and director.<br/><br/>That said, ""Into the Wild"" is a beautifully-written, albeit arrogantly-directed movie. The book is paper-thin; why in the world did Penn feel compelled to make the movie well over two hours long?? It's a shame, because the length of the film diluted its poignancy and power. I kept thinking to myself, when is this guy going to (finally!) get to Alaska?! Also a shame, because Chris' final social interaction, with Ron Franz, was also the most touching one.<br/><br/>I can't see how someone could fully appreciate the movie without reading the book (as evidenced by people who, thinking it was some kind of comic relief, were laughing in the theater when Chris was shouting to the sky how hungry he was). I don't want to make my own conjectures about Chris' sanity, motivations, or responsibility; you're supposed to judge that for yourself. And in some ways, your impression of Chris will probably echo your feelings about the film."

","I really liked the movie, not for the way the protagonist (Chris McCandless) lived his life but for the great lessons presented to us during the course of the movie. There might be different ways for different people to live their lives but movie showed what everyone should be looking for in their lives. I would like to mention a few lessons which I personally liked in the movie:<br/><br/>1. Set yourself free to explore what the soul inside us wants to and not just succumb to a life of security.<br/><br/>When Chirs McCandless says: "".. so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun."" <br/><br/>Taken from song Society by Eddie Vedder from the movie: ""It's a mystery to me .. We have a greed with which we have agreed And you think you have to want more than you need Until you have it all you won't be free.""<br/><br/>2. Never let your mistakes be a reason to be not able to do better in future. Instead we should use the learning from the mistakes to do much better.<br/><br/>Taken from Song Rise by Eddie Vedder: ""Gonna rise up Turning mistakes into gold""<br/><br/>As for the way Chris McCandless lived his life, I just have to say this was the way he wanted to live. A different person might have done different things in the same situation but the heart of the movie lied in its teachings which I can sum up as ""One should learn, struggle, pursue his dreams during his life and do whatever it takes to find and fulfill the purpose of his life."""

When he makes it there, he plans to live a solitary life in the wild. It is a truly great work of cinema. This movie is quite inspiring. It hits the audience at deep emotional levels and challenges us to ponder whether or not we could abandon everything and survive. I decided to take up that challenge and see what life had in store for me.<br/><br/>This movie made me realize that material possessions and family don't really mean anything in the whole scheme of things. So, I sold all of my family's possessions, gave the money away, and abandoned my wife and children. I can't have anything like loved ones holding me back. They would only be a burden. <br/><br/>I decided to take with me one backpack filled with the following items: my ""World's Greatest Dad"" T-shirt my kids gave me for Father's Day last year, one can of pinto beans, two honey buns, a 6-pack of Diet Dew, and my lava lamp for entertainment when I get bored.<br/><br/>I walked a couple miles and found a highway where I could hitchhike. A man picked me up in his green Chevy truck. We immediately hit it off. His name was Brian. After a while of small talk, he informed me that he was a leader of a small cult. He gave me his card and told me to check it out if I had the chance. I told him if I ever came back to civilization that's the first place I would visit. He dropped me off a little ways from town, and I made my way to the woods to live my life of solitude.<br/><br/>My first mission was to find sustenance. It is hunt or be hunted in the dark wilderness. So, I went on the prowl. I found some ducks next to a small pond. A young duckling was lagging behind the mother duck and her other offspring. A chose this one as the weakest link and decided to make my move. I captured the little creature. He quacked and quacked for his mother to save him but she and the other offspring had flown off after noticing me.<br/><br/>I was fully intent on killing this young animal for food. My hands were around its neck, but something happened. I noticed the sad look it had in its eyes. His eyes said to me, ""Please don't hurt me. I just came into this world. I have barely even gotten to explore. Let me live, and I will stand by your side and keep you company on your perilous journey."" The duckling is now my best friend. The only friend I have out here.<br/><br/>Since my hunt was unsuccessful, I reached into my backpack for food. I looked inside and immediately threw out the lava lamp upon realizing how heavy it was and that there are no plug-ins in the woods. I also threw out the can of pinto beans because I hate pinto beans. It just seems like in every movie you see, if someone goes out in the woods, they always eat a can of beans. I figured they would grow on me. <br/><br/>I ate both my honey buns and drank all six Diet Dews within an hour. I am not very good at rationing. I looked over at my new best friend duckling who I had recently named Marvin. He looked at me and quacked. I interpreted that quack as him telling me, ""Look at yourself. The wilderness is not the place for you. It is cruel out here, and you cried the last time you went to get a haircut. A man like that isn't suited to be out here. Brian is out there waiting for you. Pick me up and let's go meet him.""<br/><br/>So I followed Marvin's advice. I walked back into town and found my cult leader friend. Brian took me to their meeting place, and we had a great punch party. Brian and Marvin and I decided to rent an apartment together, and I became a full-time member of his cult. I made a lot of great friends over there. I still have yet to visit my family since I've been back. I heard my wife was with some other man named Dan now, but it doesn't matter to me. I never cared much for my wife and children anyway. These people are my family now.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are looking for an inspiring and emotional tale, then I highly recommend this movie. It changed my life, and it can change yours too.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Your fellow IMDb user blakelogsdon1"
"callanvass","10","1","4","20 January 2014"," One of the most incredible films you'll ever see. It will leave you thinking for a while
","Chris McCandless is an ambitious young man who has just graduated from university. He is bored of civilization, his parents, and his current life in general. He decides to unload his life savings to charity, leave all his belongings aside to go on a journey into the wilderness. He leaves his Yellow Datsun behind so nobody can find him, deciding to go on this journey penniless. Despite frantic concerns and heartbreak from his family, Chris elects not to speak to them during his journey. He encounters different types of people who not only change Chris in a profound way but others as well. I'm not trying to over hype this by any means but prepare for plenty of passion in my review. It has been a long time since a movie has moved me like this one. This movie is a triumph of the human spirit, it's about living, sacrifice, new experiences, and how life should be about the simple things. It risks being pretentious at times but it is so adroitly done, it manages to avoid that. I actually saw the first half of this movie a couple of years ago but something popped up and I never got around to finishing it. I think that was a blessing in disguise because I am much more mature as a human being. I'm not sure I would have been able to appreciate the magnitude of this film or the beauty of it. There are so many amazing things in this movie, I don't know where to begin. The story sucked me in right from the outset. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it all the more tantalizing. For over two hours, you get to see many breathtaking sights from the terrific cinematography. It never gets old, trust me. Before I continue further, I'd like to speak a little bit about Christopher McCandless. The man is a very controversial figure. He has had people divided over what he decided to do. I'm one of the people who respect and admire his tenacity, and his unbridled passion. You can say what you want about him being unprepared, I just think he did something we all strive to do at a certain time. We may not have wanted to do exactly what he's done, but I'm sure many, myself included have wanted to leave everything behind and go on a journey with the freedom to live without a care in the world. In my opinion, Chris should have the utmost respect from people. He was a kind-hearted soul that didn't deserve to go so early. I may not have known him personally, but I wish I could have. I truly admire him. <br/><br/>The second half is when things get a bit tougher to watch. it was in context with the story, so I accepted it, but I am very uncomfortable with animal killings. I've never agreed with hunting in genera but I accept why people do it. Even though a lot of it was in flashbacks, it was also rough to watch Chris's parents (Played with bravura by William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden in so much anguish, even if they were partly responsible for Chris's disappointment. I especially felt for Carine (Jena Malone) She was the most genuine person, besides Chris in that family. It really tugs on your heart strings. You would think with the long running time, you might get a bit restless. I didn't. My eyes were glued to the T.V screen. I have to give a special mention to Emile Hirsch for his brave and Oscar worthy performance as Chris McCandless. He hits all of the right notes throughout the movie and gives a flawless performance. I've liked him ever since I saw Girl Next Door, and my respect for him is even bigger. It was a complex character he played and he nailed it. The supporting cast of Catherine Keener, Brian H. Dierker, Vince Vaughn, Hal Holebrook & Kristen Stewart have small but pivotal parts in this movie. I'd say Holebrook & Stewart standout the most out of all of them but they were all great. I can't remember the last time I legitimately cried during a movie, let alone cried. I'm not ashamed to say that I wept at the end of the movie. I stood there staring at the T.V in a lucid state before I gathered myself. I was emotionally exhausted, in a good way. Casual viewers may not get why I loved this movie so much but those that appreciate brilliant work will experience something that they won't forget. Sean Penn has created one of the greatest films I've ever seen. If you've made it this far in the review, drop whatever you're doing and go see it. If you don't get any emotions from watching this movie, go see a shrink. I guarantee it will uplift you in some fashion. Thank you Sean Penn for putting your heart and soul into this movie. <br/><br/>10/10"
"k_28","10","1","4","15 February 2012"," A Liberating Film
","""Into The Wild"" is a truly beautiful & liberating film ; it liberates one,s soul from the mundane material excesses of life. Based on true story of Christopher Mccandless , a young at age of 23 leaves everything behind in his pursuit of happiness , happiness as he seek in truth , purity & freedom from society (or rather its lies & hypocrisies) . If there is one movie which one can watch a million times & still feel inspired every single time , then ""Into the Wild"" along with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has to be there. Both are stories of eternal optimism of life & freedom of soul. The only difference between two is one if fictional while other true story.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so special is not just acting from Emile Hirsch which is simply superb , but also its director Sean Penn. He penned movie in narratives of his sister which are heart wrenching & are spoken with such bare essences that one could feel the pain of Chris. There are numerous others who had given memorable performances in their 5-10 mins screen time (Stuart & Hal Holbrook in particular) , which is essentially a director,s feat.<br/><br/>I always felt envy of those people who can live their dreams. It doesn't really matter what that dream is , as long as those who want it , have courage to go that path , not caring about anyone or anything ,are happiest people on this planet. Very few could do so. One of the most amazing lines in movie is """"career is a 20th century invention"" , we increasingly define life in terms of material gains , gadgets , property , money etc. never realizing , money is a means to an end & not an end in itself . & in running after the means we lose our ends.<br/><br/>The movie is for you if you are the one who feels pain by the lies....if you are not a believer in ""surviving life"" and believe in ""living life"" or you really know there difference between these two; Chris did....he wanted a true life ...he was sad man when he had ""all that "" which he left behind and was much happier when he was penniless... Its a journey inside a soul with the vessel of nature to live a beautiful & positive life. A must watch."
"pc95","7","1","4","9 December 2008"," Brilliant Photography, interesting story, very POOR music
","I doubt most people made a fuss about this; had non-obstructive music been chosen for this film, it would've been a much better movie. As it is, it's a compelling narrative with exceedingly colorful photography and some excellent stop-motion interspersed. Characters of the film seem plausible, simple, and down-to-earth. The lead character ""Alex SuperTramp"" is stubbornly determined. Also Dialog was succinct, sometimes poignant....and actual narration expository. However It's becoming more and more disappointing to declare movies problematic due to music. Not all the music in Into the Wild was gratingly irritating, but many of the interlude cuts were totally subtractive. The last thing I wanna hear is MTV-type framed folksy stylized singing littering over a film like bad garbage. At least half a dozen interludes were interlaced with it - enough of a problem that the fast-forward was button got used. Why cant directors, stick to real dialog? Or employ music as an enhancement rather than a forced interpretation. Melodies during motion pictures are fouled by lyrics - these aren't commercials!! Anyway, somewhat of a letdown for how good it should've been minus the music cut-overs."
"Addieo","10","1","4","29 September 2008"," Thoughts Of The Wild
","Please read the whole of my comment before judging.<br/><br/>First off let me start off by stating that this is my most favourite film I have ever seen. I have also read the the book by Jon Krakauer and loved that too. I recommend that you watch the film first. I don't know where exactly my love of this film comes from whether it is my fascination at his love for giving. Maybe it is his will to drop everything for the experience of a life time instead of the same experience most ""normal"" people get in there life of dead ends.<br/><br/>The fact that this is a true story makes it even better. Emile Hirsch makes me believe that Chris McCandless was actually like this. He puts his heart and soul in to this performance and you can really see it. His acting his some of the best I've seen him produce, up there with his role of Jay Adams in Lords Of Dogtown. Just from the way people spoke of Chris, Emile shines this image right on through to the screen. I think Vince Vaughn's performance in this is to be commended as well seen as this is the first ""serious"" role I have seen him in and he plays Wayne Westerberg really well. Hats off to Sean Penn for his directing in this film it was a pleasure to watch. Nice to see Jim Gallien playing himself as well.<br/><br/>This film is for the more ""open"" film watches. People who are willing to understand that this is a true story and it can't be packed with action every second because that is not the way his or anyone else's lives are. It is a very slow 2 hour film but this time if not more was required to set the relationship between the viewer and Chris/Emile and to tell his tale in full.<br/><br/>I am captivated with this film/book and Chris McCandless' life I hope you like it too. My dream one day is to go to Alsaka but unlike many people I shall be taking a map and a compass and maybe even a guide. I don't know about you but I want to visit Fairbanks 142. For fans of The Beach."
"hknivers","10","1","4","15 September 2008"," Awesome! In the full sense of the word...
","I saw this movie on a whim. Read about it here on IMDb and thought it looked OK. I went into the viewing with hardly any expectation. Man, was I in for a treat.<br/><br/>This is actually one of the best movies I have ever seen. It touched something deep inside me. I don't know if it is the mood of the film, the fantastic imagery, the beautiful music by Eddie Vedder (which I by the way have bought and been listening to over and over again for three weeks now) or what. It might have been that I am myself a ""man of nature"" and spend most of the summer and autumn out in the wilderness fishing and hunting. He kinda does what I have always wanted to do, just leave everything to go and stay in the wild.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the music is great, the visual is just amazing, the story is real and heartfelt. This movie is a real masterpiece and I would recommend this to anyone!"

","This movie is amazing, it stays in your mind once you saw it. All I can say is: great story, great actors, great pictures, great soundtrack.....<br/><br/>Above all, this is based on a true story. A story of a young man who leave everything behind, go out to find a real life without lies. Finally he found friends and adventure and paid a huge price but the most interesting thing is, he was alive when he died. There is no better way to putting it.<br/><br/>Sean Penn did a remarkable job do create the picture of an extraordinary, complicated young man brilliantly played by Emile Hirsch.<br/><br/>And the last picture, the photograph of the real Chris McCandless, I guarantee you, you will not forget it!"

","This had to be one of the most moving films i've ever seen. How Emile Hirsch has portrayed this fine young man has astounded me and made me eager to see some of his new work. But Emile isn't the extent of the greatness of this film, no, far from it every actor Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, Jena Malone and especially the triumphant return of Hal Holbrook all are at the top of their game and were very believable. I never thought of Sean Penn as a great director especially after seeing in my opinion the lukewarm ""The Pledge"" but he truly is for this picture. Many people including my father have criticized this film because they believe that Chris was stupid and self centered. But what they don't understand is that Chris simply didn't want to lead a normal, average life he wanted to adventure and enjoy life's beauty. Of course he felt sorrow in the end for dying alone in the wild, but the ending is pitch perfect and made me well up in tears. Anyway this movie has inspired me in many ways, I bought the book a few days after seeing the film in theaters and just today bought the DVD and look forward to seeing it again. 10/10 people this is a must see!"
"musick-3","10","1","4","24 August 2008"," A movie about a boy
","I think it has been somewhere nearly 1½ years since a movie had such an impact on me. (The last one was Badlands by Terrence Malick) I couldn't sleep the night after it. Had feverish dreams from which I would wake up and talk to myself, acting the movie to people around me, who were right there in front of me. It was happening to me. And it did.<br/><br/>I thought about it the next day all the time. It was like the state when something happens that breaks all the structure in your life. I felt sad. Confused. Scared. Thought about dying. Laughed. And the story really isn't that amazing. The movie was shot beautifully. There where maybe like 4 times during the movie that I thought it could end now and I would be fine with it. Sean Penn is a great director. But still, that wasn't the charm. I don't know what was. And it wasn't confusing like the first time you saw The Fountain, Memento or The Matrix. Nothing like that. It just drained me.<br/><br/>Many people seem to be stuck on analyzing why Chris (played poetically by Emile Hirsch) did why he did what he did. But nobody tries to see HOW the things he did were PORTRAYED. It is a movie after all.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone got this movie. But I hope they will. And then they can explain it to me."
"pjennings-2","4","1","4","19 July 2008"," Penn and Pearl Jam on Tour
","Sold to many on the score alone, a film musically endorsed by the Pearl Jam legend that is Eddie Vedder, fails to live up to expectations. The profound protagonist, Christopher McCandless, embarks on a 'meaning of life' expedition literally in to wild to do battle with the demons within born from a material world and a loveless upbringing. At two hours and twenty eight minuets there are endless life affirming statements that ultimately add up to a rather pretentious take on a self-discovery voyage. I simply wanted to shake the chap by the arms and tell him to stop being so down right silly. The film spends too much time covering the same ground to be truly compelling. However, when it does finally arrive at its climatic end it is undeniably emotional and a pouring of sympathy is well deserving. I personally only realised that this was a true story at the very end of the film. This of course makes the circumstances that McCandeless finds himself in all the more difficult to bear. A good performance from Emile Hirsch and top draw direction for Sean Penn certainly makes it worth a look in, but it for one hour and nineteen minuets it does not match up to its own hype."
"Devotee9","10","1","4","15 July 2008"," Breathtakingly beautiful
","I saw this movie twice in theater and the second time I found it even more beautiful than the first time. As foolish as some people may call Christopher McCandless, I think it is beautiful that he did exactly what he believed in. Of course we all know that Crhistopher McCandless made mistakes, but ask yourself; why do I keep thinking about this story? Because it reminds us of what we could be capable of. We could do more with our lives than we do now, exploit the possibilities the human body gives us.<br/><br/>There are some amazing lines in the script such as:<br/><br/>""the sea's only gifts are harsh blows, and occasionally, the chance to feel strong. now, i don't know much about the sea, but i do know that that's the way it is here, and i also know how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong, but to feel strong. to measure yourself at least once. to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions, facing the blind, deaf stone alone, nothing to help you but your hands and your own head."" -- Beautiful!!<br/><br/>Into the wild tells a story of a stubborn, but moreover idealistic young man who wants to get out of our 'sick society' and eventually go on his 'great Alaskan adventure'; to get lost in the wild. He meets a lot of interesting people on the road and goes places not many people go. <br/><br/>Beautiful music, excellent acting and breathtaking shots of nature.<br/><br/>This story will stay with you."

That I guess is a great accomplishment for a movie and a pretty rare moment in theaters.<br/><br/>And yes, according to me, this is one of the best movies in history so far. It is pure poetry. And again Sean Penn is involved, this time directing. That man really know what art is. And he also, is an artist.<br/><br/>The movie of course, strikes top vote and beyond. One reason for that is that is covers the most important topic for the human nature these days, the climate change.

","This movie was a very inspirational and emotional one. I find much interest in movies and books that deal with a persons passion in pursuing a dream. Because this movie had such an effect on me I have begun to read the book and done research on the whole adventure of McCandless as well. I have much respect for this brave soul, and his bold, stubborn, yet strong beliefs along with his extremely self-less behaviors to the people he encounters (other than his parents) and passion of independence. I believe that many of us can learn from Chris, I sure have, and make the world a more comfortable place to live. This movie as well as the book has opened my eyes to the life I live and the world around me."
"fwomp","10","1","4","11 March 2008"," Leaves It To You To Decide...
","At first, I wasn't sure how to feel about INTO THE WILD. I'd read the book a few years ago and enjoyed it, but it left me feeling a bit bitter about someone as privileged as Chris McCandless (the main character/person in Jon Krakauer's nonfiction novel by the same name) who shuns his upper echelon possibilities after graduating from Emory and disappears into America, leading the free life of a moneyless vagabond.<br/><br/>Certainly we've all thought about what it would be like to be completely unencumbered by the shackles of ""things."" No cars. No mortgages/rent. Nothing but the open road and endless options spreading out before us. And this is what makes us care for Chris McCandless, the unfortunate (and very misguided) young man who's fate is tied to his own ignorance of what that kind of life entails.<br/><br/>If you speak to anyone from Alaska, most will tell you what an idiot McCandless was. He went into the wild with only a backpack and a rifle, supposedly ""ready"" to live the life of a hermit on a decrepit and abandoned school bus. The Alaskan wilderness (or any comparable wilderness really) is unforgiving. If you aren't prepared, you're going to die. And McCandless, with his lofty dreams of wildlife living, was ill-prepared in the extreme; his life cut short due to his own ignorance.<br/><br/>So why the high rating, you may ask? Well, I'm not here to support or degrade what McCandless did or didn't do. I'm here to rate the film, and on that, you can't help but appreciate what director Sean Penn has given us. Showing McCandless' strengths and weaknesses, Penn guides us through the life of Chris without telling us how to feel about it. Actor Emile Hirsch pulls in an extremely powerful performance as Chris McCandless. The fact that the Academy didn't recognize him is a shame; they did note Hal Holbrook's supporting actor performance (which was damn good), but a far cry from Hirsch's awesome job (he lost 40 lbs during the filming so that he could show McCandless' starvation). Penn's screen writing and directing are flat-out amazing, giving us a story that allows the viewer to make his or her own judgements about this very enigmatic young man.<br/><br/>I feel compelled to mention that some may compare McCandless' actions with those of another dead Alaskan visitor, Timothy Treadwell of the nonfiction film GRIZZLY MAN. Although both certainly had their failings, Treadwell was definitely mentally ill, while McCandless simply seems to lack life goals and instead substitutes vagrancy in order to run away from problems back home.<br/><br/>In the end, I finally came to the conclusion that Penn did exactly what all great film makers do: he gave us a story that many people probably would've found pretentious and plopped into our laps without any filters or rose-coloring. That put the burden on the audience to come to terms with what McCandless' life really meant. Fool? Free-Spirit? Ignorant preppie? Loving brother? Easy-going drifter? Or perhaps a mesh of many of those.<br/><br/>You decide."
"markscosmiclight","10","1","4","7 March 2008"," The Film Is Greatly Inspiring to Say the Least
","I must comment personally as I acted on the set as a close-up background extra in the restaurant scene for two 12 hour days sitting nearly next to the portrayed family played by Emile Hirsch, William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden. It was one of the most enjoyable scenes on a set of many that I have appeared in and acted here in my home town of Portland Oregon while listed with a studio for this work.<br/><br/>I was anxious of course to see the movie as it released and this particular scene and how I appeared, only to find that the editing cut much of the background appearance out. I hope to see an uncut version of the movie one day as Penn came to each restaurant table to film each group of acting parents with their graduating children up close.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I was pleasantly shocked that the story line paralleled my own life and a 10,000 mile solo road trip that I made within one month in 2000 to perform a sidewalk astronomy venture for the random public and schools with the use of an expensive solar research-grade telescope. The character, McCandless that Emile Hirsch plays, encounters very similar incidences with relationships and people just as I did on my trip. That of a hidden prophecy finally revealed and there is something to be learned. Some scenes in the movie brought me to tears. He, the character McCandless, encounters very similar people, the opposite genders offerings, accidental and serendipitous events, the old sage father-like figure played by Hal Holbrook is what I thought, was Holbrook's finest acting ever. The scenery in Alaska with the music soundtrack is captivating; breathtaking. The movie simply inspires any viewer to realize that we as humans are driven and obligated to adventure and to the call of the wild. I believe there is something for everyone in this film. Penn's direction and work on this film is well deserving of many awards. Mark"

","Immensely inspiring. It's a beautiful film filled with lush cinematography and superb performances. The driving force has got to be in the story. Christopher McCandless' theory of life is one that I couldn't relate to more and seeing how his life played out was extremely compelling. Emile Hirsch was...sensational. A performance that held so many emotions on it's shoulders and combined them flawlessly. In one brief smile I felt all the happiness that he gathered from the wild in my heart. This sheer joy and inspiration was contrasted painfully with the heartache of his final days on Earth which Hirsch again captured expertly in nothing more than his eyes. The shot near the beginning of his eyes tearing up as he sees the beauty of a herd of animals roaming in the snow is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. I can't describe how much I loved Hirsch in this. It's a poetic and wonderfully uplifting tale that had me in awe the entire duration. I should also mention that Eddie Vedder's songs were breathtaking."

","I have a review to write, but i have to tell you it's been a while since i've been so overwhelmed when the credits roll. I can't say i would be a fan of Sean Penn the man, but i've always admired his skills both on a off the camera. I think, with 'Into The Wild' he truly finds his level, and it's fair to say this is his masterpiece.<br/><br/>'Into The Wild' is a gripping real life story about a young man who had it all coming to him, speaking in terms 'the normal world' suggests. Yet, he chose something else. His dreams and ambitions striked me as eerily familiar, i've had similar thoughts about my life. This story could've been a turkey if it would've headed to the familiar Hollywood direction where the adventure is romanticized. Fortunately, truth is stranger than fiction.<br/><br/>This is a film about love, happiness, loneliness, passion, and the road to wisdom. For all these emotions you need more than one person, and that's what the main character finally understands, when he is deep in the wilderness. For those of you who dismissed this film as being bad moral guidance, bad influence for teenagers, you have missed the message, OK? You can read all the Thoreau and London you want, but if you are blind and deaf, it won't help you. The bible is a good example.. Chris finally understands what he's reading, when he answers the question 'what else is there?'<br/><br/>An astonishing film in every way, story, direction, acting, cinematography...best of the decade so far, and naturally, ignored by the academy."

","Sean Penn reaches here a peak in his vision of society. He reaches a turning point in his historical approach of life. He depicts what 1968ers and hippies have become thirty years later, today, and what their idealism and ideals may produce today. Christopher, an allusion to a certain Christopher Columbus, decides to abandon everything, to give away his 24,000 dollars of savings, to burn his money and disappear in the vast territory known as the USA. He is looking for real life, for real nature, for real humanity, a life, a nature, a reality that are no longer simulacra of the truth, the truth that existed before man and humanity perverted it. So, along the road, he explores several possibilities that are all fake and he will end in Alaska. Sean Penn accumulates the elements showing there is no escape from society and civilization. No escape for the hippie couple Christopher becomes friendly to and who move freely thanks to their caravan, making an income along the way by selling second hand books they recuperate left and right. No escape from social norms in sex when Christopher refuses the approach and gift from a girl on the only basis that she is 16. Woodstock is really gone and forgotten. No escape in the friendship he develops with a farmer of some type who is finally caught up by the FBI for some illegal activity. No escape in the friendship he develops with an older retired GI who proposes to adopt him to provide him with some kind of a family, to provide himself with some kind of a substitute for his accidentally killed son. But no escape either in Alaska where he is trapped in a way three times, at least. Trapped in a bus that is grounded in the middle of the wilderness. Too easy to survive in this absolutely human environment whose engine is dead and has no fuel. Trapped by his forgetting that to survive in nature you have to know nature's cycle and he did not know the migration cycles of animals and found himself one day foodless, and he did not know the cycles of the rivers and found himself locked up by the water of the river and crossed on foot before. Trapped finally by his lack of knowledge about nature and by his lack of preparation that makes him mix up two wild plants, one edible and one inedible. And he dies slowly poisoned by wild sweet peas. And finally, but too late, he understands that happiness is only real when it is shared. But it is too late and he can only compensate his death with the beauty of the sky his dying eyes capture as he breathes out his very last breath of life. Complete, absolute, irreversible evolution of humanity from barbaric animality to necessarily social and shared civilization. To refuse that historical construct is to refuse to live and to condemn oneself to death, in other words to commit suicide.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","This is a noble and intelligent film for the thinking person; a real film about things that really matter. I would even say that this is an important film, and it is quite simply magnificent.<br/><br/>Our hero goes off to the farthest reaches of the Alaskan wilderness, into the wild, to escape from everything; to be alone in nature and to find himself, his true identity and happiness. En route, he is warmly welcomed, even loved by everyone he meets, but turns his back on them all to continue his quest alone. It takes him a long time and many adventures, before his persistence pays off and he arrives at his destination. But he becomes trapped by, and a victim of, the very wilderness that he so ardently sought. He has gone too far down the road of isolation and solitude and he cannot get back.<br/><br/>Eventually, but too late, the realisation hits home that, in fact, living in isolation, we have no identity. Indeed it is only by interacting with others that we are able to define who we are, and find our true self. Human beings are not meant to live alone. We are gregarious by nature and we need relationships.<br/><br/>Like all of us, the main character is flawed and contradictory. He is at once intelligent and naive, brave and reckless, honourable and cruel. In short he is human.<br/><br/>Before he goes to Alaska, he believes that happiness has nothing to do with our relationships with other people. At the end of his time there, he writes in his journal ""happiness is only real when shared"".<br/><br/>Before arriving in Alaska he tells a friend that it is not good for him to live alone, in isolation, then he goes and goes off and does exactly that himself.<br/><br/>Before leaving, he gives all of his money away to charity, even setting fire to his last remaining banknotes, but then has to work in a burger king to earn enough money to complete his journey.<br/><br/>This is an intensely human film which won my admiration. Although dealing with such philosophical issues as what is real, what is happiness, and our need to find ourselves and give meaning to our lives, Sean Penn (who produced, directed and wrote the screenplay) does not set himself up as the next Nietzsche. No he throws out various possibilities, but leaves the answers open to personal interpretation. He provides the food for us to chew on, but leaves us to decide what we choose to swallow.<br/><br/>If you have ever felt like running away from life, or pondered the question of happiness, then you should go and see this film. Even if you haven't, one day you probably will, so go and see it anyway! <br/><br/>The verdict: a rare pearl of a film, with, dare I say, a touch of wisdom?"

","Fresh from viewing Into the Wild, without ever having read this book, I can say with certainty that this is one of the best films I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Some may site Mc Candless as having been selfish and ignorant, but we are seeing a man who has chosen to bypass consumerism and live a life that was his truth. He died living his truth.<br/><br/>Take into the account the scene, in which he is in LA and passes by a club and glimpses himself as the man in the business suit. That was not who he was. He lived life by defining it. Had he lived by societal traditions, this story wouldn't exist.<br/><br/>Sean Penn delivers one of his best films. This is a striking portrayal of a young man who sought a dream, who had the courage to follow his heart, and give up monetary possessions which awakens us to what is truly important in life."
"zeedunn","9","1","4","23 November 2007"," Escape the Mold of Society
","When Christopher McCandless graduated from Emory University, his parents are sure he will follow the path they have set for him: becoming a lawyer. McCandless wants nothing to do with that. He has grown up watching his parents choke on the American dream. They seem terribly unhappy.<br/><br/>Instead, he wants to break out of the trap, give away all of his money, take only the most essential possessions on his back, and work his way up to his ultimate adventure: surviving alone in Alaska. He left home in summer of 2000. By April of 2002, he was ready to walk into the wilds of Alaska.<br/><br/>On September 6, 2002, McCandless's malnourished body was bound in a bus he had survived in for the past several months. What lead him to this fate? Dying alone is no man's dream. Primary source material for this movie and the book it was based on are the journals McCandless filled while he was on the road.<br/><br/>We see his trek across the country. The people he met and befriended. Everyone seemed to like him. Some people were ready to adopt him or make him their pseudo-son. He made no judgments and seemed to have no vices. He doesn't drink too much or accept inappropriate offers from under-aged girls. And he is single-minded in his goal. We also see the sadder side of this story, the sister and parents he left behind. They seem haunted by his absence.<br/><br/>The performances are amazing by all characters. This film will make you question the choices you made when you were at those essential years after college. There is one telling scene where McCandless is walking the streets of a bustling metropolis. He people watches and sees a well-dressed man eating fine food at the table. The man seems confident and happy as he gorges himself. McCandless looks again and see his own face instead of the man's. And he runs as fast as he can away from the city. He knows he is not immune to the charms of wealth and suburban living, and it scares him to death. He knows one thing: he doesn't want to become his parents.<br/><br/>I felt sad at McCandless's fate, but at least he lived in a way he believed."

","I noticed that one commenter called the film ""pretentious"" and ""boring,"" which is what led me to comment myself. Everything about this film was exceptional. No, it is not your run-of-the-mill, commercial, explosion-filled McMovie. It is an actual film. It is meaningful art. If you found it pretentious, that probably has to do with your own ego and that the film's message clashes with your worldview, which is probably the dominant American ideology of consumerism (buy more and you'll be happy, we promise! buying stuff is the meaning of life! buy buy buy!). I almost teared up early on in this move, and even as a full-grown man, who is not ""supposed"" to cry, I eventually did cry a little. And the main character did *not* have his ""arms in the air constantly."" It sounds to me like some people just found this film's message disagreeable or simply did not get it (probably a little of both). Of course anyone can nitpick about minor details of the film that may have been improved, but I think they would be missing the forest for the trees."

A very moving, powerfully suspenseful, substantial, insightful antidote to the poisonous view of life engendered by life in a puerile, inhumane, greedy, impetuous, ignorant, society of primates bent on destroying the world for short sighted selfish ends like a tribe of chimpanzees on a rampage, people who will sooner run you over and kill you, rather than lift their foot from the gas pedal for one second, a society that is more of a fearful mob made up of individuals acting in a concerted frenzy out of terrified fear of all the other frenzied, concerted, insane, vicious, rugged individuals that compose the madding mass of lunatics than a group of human beings rather than mere blobs of protoplasm insensible to any but the very extremes of pain and pleasure viz. twentyfirst century Americans."

","In my opinion, this is not a movie for everyone. Don't misunderstand me here; I cannot think of anyone who shouldn't see Into The Wild. All I mean is that in order to understand the main character's choices, his longing for what isn't, and his distaste for what really is in this world of ours (and thereby be able to truly appreciate this movie), you have to - to one extent or another - have shared the particular state of mind and emotion that drives him.<br/><br/>You have to see that the character's behavior isn't only a result from a (subjectively speaking) rational chain of thoughts; but more interestingly and important, it's the result of a strong but indescribable emotion.<br/><br/>I haven't felt such perfect story telling, and I haven't felt such sympathy for a character, since I read ""Steppenwolf"" and ""Siddharta"" by Hermann Hesse. For all of us who constantly feel the dualism between living the adult life we all projected as children and taking the step towards the life that you feel you personally are ""meant"" to live, this movie is not only a must-see, but also a temporary antidote to the feeling of ""being the only one standing outside the *regular* world""."
"joaocruzferreira","9","1","4","19 November 2007"," Sean Penn's Masterpiece
","""Into the Wild"" is based on a true story and the bestselling book by Jon Krakauer. After graduating, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandoned all his possessions, gave his entire savings to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this motion picture is absolutely breath-taking. This is a splendid example of film-making. In addition, I was particular blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, veteran Hal Holbrook makes the film a must-see. Their scene in the truck near the end is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen, as well as easily the most moving scene of the year. The young Emile Hirsch surprised Hollywood and Penn gets a terrific performance out of him, Catherine Keener, Marcia Gay Harden, Vince Vaughn and William Hurt.<br/><br/>Chris' story is worth telling and ""Into the Wild"" shows this. It is a remarkable film. The two hours and a half are over before you know it, and by then you care not only for the lead character, but for all sympathetic characters we have met on the way.<br/><br/>The snubs were tremendous for Sean Penn (Best Directing, Best Adapted Scerenplay), Hirsch (Best Leading Actor) and Keener (Best Supporting Actres). Not even Eddie Vedder got any respect for his score and songs or Eric Gautier for his excellent cinematography. No one will ever understand the Academy. 9/10"
"Batmantis_001","9","1","4","10 November 2007"," Now that was a good movie...
","I just went and saw a stunning movie, called Into the Wild, written and directed by Sean Penn. It follows the true story of a sharp, college grad, named Christopher McCandless, born with a calling from nature, that could not allow him to stay tied to society. Feeling the burdens of imprisonment and authority, he flees his hometown on a journey of wisdom and liberation, to the wilderness, and meets companions along the way, whom he has a lasting effect on.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is the first movie I've seen since Field of Dreams that actually made me feel like a better person for having watched it. Although it has deeply sad moments, it brought out in me a certain feeling of youth and redemption, that I think anyone could appreciate. It also hit at a crucial theme, and that is success is only true when it is felt and shared, without materialism. This all may sound very sappy, especially when coming from one of the more sarcastic people you'll ever meet, but let that be evidence of how well done, and real this movie is. Go see it."
"jay-collier","8","1","4","2 November 2007"," Asks important questions
","Can happiness be found only through the solitary pursuit of pure knowledge and truth? Or can it be discovered in the simple life of shared experience with others? In Sean Penn's Into the Wild, this appears to be an either/or question. By the time Christopher McCandless discovers he's taken the high solitary road all the way to a dead-end, it's too late; he's killed himself by eating poisonous berries in the Alaska bush. Was his journey a noble one or the indulgence of extended American adolescence? Was he an heroic figure or a romantic naif? In the film, moments of insight are delivered in stark, unmistakable contrast: McCandless' painful family secret is shown as core motivation; his effortless, yet detached wisdom on the road is appreciated by his companions but deemed by him to be less worthy than his high ideals; and the death of his final prey ends up being pointless, its carcass scavenged by a bald eagle. The film brings us right to the threshold of considering these questions with depth. Then it ends.<br/><br/>With Into the Wild, Penn has made some rather confident directorial choices. As bookends to the core journey, son and father gaze directly into the camera, reminding us that their stories are being told for an audience. Penn presents a three-tiered time line that, through the juxtaposition of stories, resonates with layered meaning. And, as McCandless' final mentor, Hal Holbrook's portrayal of earnest, vulnerable love is unparalleled.<br/><br/>At the same time, the repeated use of fast- and slow-motion scenes seems unnecessarily self-conscious, the voice-over is presented without reflective pause, and the music is underutilized; it is grafted on top of the film rather than integrated with syncopation or finesse. Quotes are sprinkled throughout, as if to say, ""hey, this guy really read a lot!"" So ... is this the doomed journey of a hero? the tragedy of a wasted life? the shaming of 1960s parental norms? a cautionary tale of cultural alienation? Echoes of Voltaire (Candide), Maugham (The Razor's Edge), Hesse (Narcissus and Goldmund) abound.<br/><br/>In the end, I hope that Penn (and Krakauer) are suggesting that the rejection of 20th-century American culture is not a destination, but simply a stopping point on a path to bring that insight back into loving lives with others, as teacher, as companion, as friend.<br/><br/>If he'd lived, where would Christopher McCandless be today? Would we care about his story?"
"jjl-3","7","1","4","25 October 2007"," Mainly Pointless
","The film was a well-written, had great acting and great directing but this all went towards telling a mostly pointless story. Similar movies could have been made about any of a million emotionally troubled homeless people. I think that this particular troubled homeless man's story got made into a film for two reasons. He liked to quote literature, giving the writer a handy device for revealing the protagonists thoughts concisely and poetically. He also chose to be homeless in scenic locations which made for a pretty movie.<br/><br/>The movie is worth seeing for all of its good qualities, just don't expect to gain any insights into the human condition, or to see a character learn and grow in any meaningful way. For my money The Razor's Edge was a much more interesting film in the same genre.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that the story of Into the Wild should have veered from reality to make it more interesting. I'm saying that the story wasn't interesting enough to make it into a movie."

I spent a few years traveling alone from 1994-1996. This film reminded my why I left and why I returned. Ten years later, all grown up with all the crap, I'm haunted again by Chris. What a well done job. The scene when the Alex met the girl in sixteen was wonderful and made me cry little it touched my heart The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great."

","Greetings again from the darkness. On the road to self-discovery, Christopher McCandless meets many interesting people. The film is kind of a cross between ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Harold and Maude"". Based on the true story of McCandless and his attempt to drop out of society, live as one with nature and discover his soul. He takes much of his guidance from the writings of Tolstoy, Thoreau and Jack London.<br/><br/>The film grabs you, but you can't really be sure why. It must have something to do with all of us carrying that buried desire to really find ourselves. Problem is, we are too caught up in living life every day to do something so selfish.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch (the new ""next big thing"") is outstanding in the lead role. We like him and find ourselves pulling for him. He is a positive influence on those he meets, although we can't be sure if the real Chris McC was this influential. Still it is fascinating to travel with him as he truly gets naked to the world.<br/><br/>Supporting cast is fine, though Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt are given little to do. Always nice to see Jena Malone on screen (here as Chris' sister). Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker are a nice touch as the hippie couple who take Chris McC under their wing ... or is it vice versa? Vince Vaughn has a brief role as a ""great man"". Kristen Stewart plays a 16 yr old with a nice voice, short shorts and a crush on Chris. The best supporting role goes to the great Hal Holbrook as the lonely guy who teaches and learns in his stint with Chris.<br/><br/>Director Sean Penn (yes, the greatest American actor) delivers wonderful visuals and plenty of opportunity for head scratching and soul searching. My only fault with the film is my serious doubt that this guy was such moral giant and life teacher at age 23. Heck with those skills, he could have been better than Dr. Phil!!

He was a likable, well adjusted young lad, who did not portray the usual hang-ups resulting from an unhappy childhood. But he still disowned his parents. He obviously kept this bitterness part of his personality well hidden from those he met on his travels. So, in that respect the film just does not add up. Hal Holbrook nominated for an Oscar!??

They made a hero out of someone who actually was selfish and delusional. I can probably find a lot of people who ran away from home, turned homeless and ended up dying in a similar way (not Alaska but probably from freezing on the streets or drowning in some river or something).

The attitude against his parents after learning the facts? The movie told as if after this realization, he decided to move away. He should talk to his parents and then act in the manner he wants. This behavior is childish and makes contradiction with his decision to take his responsibility.<br/><br/>I admire that he is aware of the fact that he needs money to sustain his dream life.<br/><br/>I want to ask to the propopents of the guy : Do you want to die because of eating harmful plant?<br/><br/>We may create spare areas in our life to escape from the boring reality of life. But at the end, human is a social living creature. Happiness is real when shared as the film says in the final."

","An extraordinary person who inspires us to think.
This movie is a true gem. A young man had the vision and the guts to seek for freedom, for truth, for purity, for beauty. A very bright young man who wanted to undo himself from the lies around him. Wanting to be a balanced, independant person, selfless, not chained to a job or money. Happy with nothing. As he says himself: to kill the false being within. This extraordinary young man lived a great adventure, since he left home. Sean Penn has made a fantastic movie / almost a documentury and Emile Hirsh probably played the greatest part in his life (I hope he will play bigger and better, but people remember him now, 10 years later, as the guy from into the Wild). This is a must see movie. It opened my eyes. It shows where the real friendship and beauty lie.
I read a lot of people's reviews, especially the negative ones. Many wrote he was irresponsable, running away from home without a word. Selfish, because he only followed his dreams. I think you people are missing the point. Whose dreams should he follow then? His parents lied to him and his sister for a very long time. He was shocked, maybe devastated and wanted to pursui his own happines. Who can blame him? It was HIS life, don't forget that. This is the exact point, his life, no one owed him. He died, yes, maybe he was naive, stupid or over confident. I think he was just going for it and maybe, just maybe he made his piece dying out there. Accept that, respect that. He chose his adventure because it was his decission. His. Not ours, not from a society that constantly presses other people what to like, what to wear, what to watch and what to condemn.
Again: to kill the false being within. This is all just my opinion. I feel we are all entitled to have our own opinion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
I rated this movie a 10. This is my favorite, so I am biased."

"bahrikhadija","9","0","1","14 January 2018"," .
","One of my favorite movies of all time is ''Into the wild'' directed by Sean Penn , adobted from Jon Krakwer's book based on the true story of Christopher Mccandless who, after graduating from Emory university in 1992 , abandoned his possessions , and gave his 24000 $saving account to charity and hichhacked to Alaska to live in the wildereness .
What I didn't like about this movie is :
1) the long duration :''Into the wild'' is 2h30 long, it was a bit slow in the beginning ,but not boring at all , It could be better if the director cut off some of the small stories of each character Chtistopher meets through his journey , sometimes it was definitly worth it , and sometimes it has no influence on the main character , so there was no need to mention them , but I guess that the director wanted to respect the structure of the initial story .
2) The unexpected ending :
I didn't like how the movie ends because I was expecting Chris to find happiness in the wilderness and meet people like him , share great moments with them and learn new things ... but life is much harder , since ate a poisened plant , falling sick as a result and slowly dying ; he continues to document his process of self-realization and imagines his family for one last time. Two weeks later his body was found by hunters... and the movie ends .
Apart of that , the movies was deep and instructive , it shows us that real happiness can only be found when shared with others ."
"siderite","9","0","1","29 December 2017"," A beautiful, if a bit long, film
","It is hard to watch the movie and not experience feelings of longing for the beauty of life as shown in it. You have this young man who is determined to wander the world, reach Alaska and live off the land. He renounces a good life, a wealthy suburban family and the trappings of modern human society and embarks onto this epic quest to find the truth of life and of being. The movie is nothing if not beautiful, in the shots, the music by Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) and the great cast. Emile Hirsch is amazing in the lead role and people like Vince Vaughn, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and a lovely 17 years old Kristen Stewart support him well.<br/><br/>But not all is rosy. At two hours and a half long and slow in pace, this is an atmospheric film. You need to be in the mood to see it, to be under no time or people pressure, just in order to experience the truth of absolute freedom that writer and director Sean Penn wants to express. Also, the story is heavily dramatized, since there are a lot of inconsistencies between the facts and what you see in the film. I strongly recommend watching the movie before you research the real story. The combination of great outdoors, interesting book quotes and personal anecdotes of the people he meets makes for a nice story, but in the end the telling of it is more important than the subject at hand.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the movie reminded me a little of On the Road (also having Kristen Stewart in a supporting role) with the same idea of the great American road quest, personal freedom and exploration of the soul. If you liked that movie, you will like this one, too. You have to reserve the time and disposition to watch it and experience it. On the Road was better, though."

","A rare instance where a good book was developed into a fascinating and thought-provoking movie. Into the Wild makes you feel like the characters in a book talking to you. The movie depicts a Hippie's (wise beyond his age) perspective in experiencing life; his hatred of judging & controlling behaviors in people. The protagonist, Christopher McCandeless conveys lack of adventure as the root cause for all boredom associated with mundane lifestyles. He urges to live life to the fullest and don't get caught up in conventional style of living.<br/><br/>Every scene is an epic with most beautiful locations; every performance is noteworthy; every spoken word is a quote. Background score and songs are none less than scintillating. Got tragic climax but plenty of takeaways assured like - ""Don't be in the line of societies expectations and be happy within yourself"". <br/><br/>Overall Review: A movie that can be preserved like a book to watch over & over"

","In May 1992, Christopher McCandless arrives in a remote area just north of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska and sets up a campsite in an abandoned city bus, which he calls ""The Magic Bus."" At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares himself for a new life in the wild.<br/><br/>Two years earlier, in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from Emory University. Shortly afterwards, McCandless rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. He donates nearly all of his savings to Oxfam and sets out on a cross- country drive in his Datsun B210 to experience life in the wilderness. However, McCandless does not tell his parents, Walt and Billie McCandless, or his sister Carine what he is doing or where he is going, and refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, causing his parents to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate.<br/><br/>At Lake Mead, McCandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin hitchhiking. He burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: ""Alexander Supertramp."" In northern California, McCandless encounters a hippie couple named Jan Burres and Rainey. Rainey tells McCandless about his failing relationship with Jan, which McCandless helps rekindle. In September, McCandless arrives in Carthage, South Dakota and works for a contract harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg, but he is forced to leave after Westerberg is arrested for satellite piracy."

","I remember when this film was first released in theaters, it was a major hit and I had a lot of customers at work who kept buying the book this movie is based off one after another. It was a major bestseller. I've had a few parts of the story spoiled for me which didn't bother me when I finally watched the movie on Netflix couple months ago. So I am a late comer to this film. I titled this review ""When the heart desires freedom"" because that is what I think that this movie really expresses through the life of Chris McCandles. I think that we all have this desire of wanting to escape reality, all the worries and problems of life. And Christ McCandles did it in his own way.<br/><br/>Shot in the original places of McCandles' long adventure to finding his self actualization, the movie reminds viewers of how beautiful our country is. It almost made me want to plan a very long road trip. The cinematography in this film is simply BREATHTAKING! there's no other way of describing it. It took me a bit by surprise that Sean Penn directed this film, and even though it was with Jon Krakauer's help, I was still surprised just how magnificently well the film was directed. Kristen Stewart had a more smaller role, but did a good job. I didn't know that she was in the film and so that took me by surprise a bit too. I was kind of refreshing to see her in a non-teen movie kind of role and I think that she has been trying to shake off the image of Bella from Twilight. She certainly succeeded in this movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>I think that one of the most important things that this movie teaches is to enjoy life. All the problems of the world are just trivial things that seem to create huge stress and in many cases division between people. In this case Chris McCandles reminds us about the beautiful things in life that we take for granted because we simply don't stop and admire the beauty of nature around us."

He drives west until he can drive no farther, and then north into the Alaskan wilderness. He has a handful of books about survival and edible wild plants which he uses as his motivation and as a bible for survival.<br/><br/>We meet Christopher (Emile Hirsch) as a dreamer ,as a person who just wants the truth and is in search for it, in reaction against his proud parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and his caring and loving sister (Jena Malone). He had good grades; his future of entering into Harvard law was right within his reach.Then why and where to did he vanish ? Was one question that intrigued everyone .<br/><br/>He has journal more like notepad where he highlights any incident that takes place during the day. He sees himself become like one his models through this act of going and embracing nature and leaving all the pleasures and luxuries of life behind him.<br/><br/>Now Christopher has renamed himself Alexander Supertramp. He meets two amazing people such people as Rainey and Jan (Brian Dieker and Catherine Keener), leftover hippies still happily rejecting society, and Wayne (Vince Vaughn), a hard-drinking, friendly farmer. The most emotional and moving friend he makes is with Ron (Hal Holbrook), an older man who sees Christopher clearly as a man who is wasting his talents, as time passes and as they share a lot of memories together Ron starts to view his as his grandson. Christopher shares his view with Ron, who has seen it all, on what he is missing and asks him to follow him up a steep hillside to see the next horizon. Ron tries, before he admits he is no longer in condition.<br/><br/>And then Christopher disappears from the maps into the unforgiving Alaska. It looked breath taking. It is all he wanted from life. He tumbles upon an abandoned bus where no man would be and makes it his home. He hunts, not very successfully. From his journals and other evidence, Christopher constructs his final weeks.<br/><br/>This is a reflective, regretful, serious film about a young man swept away by his uncompromising choices. The movie is so good partly because it means so much, every person who has ever dreamt , every person who just gave up and did not do justice to his dream and by that I mean it connected to everyone who watched it cause there is always a part of you where wanted to do something like Christopher, figuratively may be not literally . It is a testament like the words that Christopher carved into planks in the wilderness. And yes at end it only matters whether or not you lived a happy life . Thats what Christopher wrote on that plank ."

The breathtaking beauty of the film is coupled with the sensational soundtrack delivered by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. The concept of living off the land and escaping society is one that I can understand. The Transcendentalist views borrowed from Emerson and Thoreau fit nicely into my wheelhouse of thought, that's probably why I found the movie so captivating that it moved me to tears. I was worried about watching the movie a second time however, I thought that the feelings that it evoked in me wouldn't be as raw and moving the second time around. I worried that it wouldn't feel like the same movie, boy was I wrong. After learning more about Chris and buying the book that inspired Sean Penn to create the film, I can say that watching it a second time made me appreciate the film even more.

","Into the Wild establishes human's obsession for a better life through contrasting the protagonist's view of the dream and the infatuation of materialistic things of the people around him. This idea was prevalent in the 1990's as a lot of America has already achieved the American Dream demonstrated in Of Mice and Men. The film explores through Christopher McCandless that this preoccupation with physical things disconnects people from true human experiences. This is displayed through the repetition of ""things, things, things, things"" which emphasizes how people now only think about material possessions. This is further expressed when he quotes Thoreau ""rather than love, than money, than faith, than fame, than fairness, give me truth."" This accumulation of human ideals signifies Christopher's straight view of happiness, excluding major parts of his life to search for a contentment. Penn not only criticizes materialism but also delves into the American Dream and how it dictates everybody's approach to happiness. This is illustrated when Christopher says ""If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, then all possibility of life is destroyed."" Through Christopher, Penn expresses the issues with people's preoccupation with physical ideals and society's compulsion to impose everyone's happiness."

","Just saw the video yesterday night. I preferred that from a Friday night stroll and was right. It is surely a movie that one can hardly forget. Reading other reviews, it's also highly controversial. It's a story that brings human nature to its extremes, human nature face to Nature. This is what I think it is mostly about. The human challenges the Nature in so many ways. Usually he challenges it by abusing and destroying. Chris challenges it by trying to impose his presence in an environment where Nature, not humans prevail. No matter how good are the purposes of one, he should not exceed his limits. Many commented that on Chris being a brat having a senseless, useless end. Many people on this planet have really senseless deaths. Children dying from bombardments or famine have definitely a senseless death. This death was not senseless. It was the pay for one's struggle to the limits and far beyond. This story also challenges the American society. This is why Americans love it so much or despise it. It describes its dead-ends, its predominant materialism. At the time of illustrating a sick society, it is a formidable testimony of what a GORGEOUS place the territory called United States is. I really fell now the need to visit it more than ever.

","""Into the Wild"" is an almost 10-year-old movie written and directed by two-time (at that point one-time) Academy Award winner Sean Penn. He wrote some more stuff in the last years, but until today, it's been the last film he has directed, even if he has an AdÃ¨le Exarchopoulos film coming up as director. ""Into the Wild"" got 2 Oscar nominations, including an acting nod for Hal Holbrook, and a couple more SAG nominations. I can't say Keener's was deserving, not sure about lead actor Hirsch. He was pretty good, but maybe not that good. We should always keep in mind that this is not a journey everybody needs to go on. It really is more of a tragedy that happened because a young man severely struggled with his life and his parents' broken marriage. I think many audiences mistake this walk for something desirable. Of course, there are positive aspects to it and maybe, if you are in a different situation than the protagonist here, it can be something that helps you with your life, something recreational, but it is not in this movie. Or do you want to die in some bus weighing only 30kg because you ate some poisonous plant?<br/><br/>I guess it is also this shocking ending that makes this film so popular. I myself did not see it coming. I thought things would work out well in the end. Then again, I also did not know this was based on a real story and this is probably the only reason why it did not. Even if I believe none of the actors were great here, I thought everybody did a decent job at least. I am surprised Brian H. Dierker acts so little as he was one of the best things about this movie. And thumbs up also for Kristen Stewart who showed us already she has great talent before her Twilight breakthrough. And last but not least, Emile Hirsch (who looks like a young Roger Federer here) carried this film for almost 2.5 hours, which is quite a spectacular achievement for such a young actor holding his own against some truly experienced folks in here. ""Into the Wild"" is among the IMDb's Top250 and I would not put it in there for my personal Top250, but it was a good watch. Thumbs up and I recommend it."

","Many Alaskans discredited Chris McCandless aka Alexander Supertramp as just another person who thought they could survive Alaska and was not prepared which lead to yet another death. However this film, and the book by Jon Krakauer, takes you on his journey and shows you that he was not completely unprepared in that he sought out the knowledge on subjects of hunting and taking care of freshly killed game. Unfortunately it was this knowledge that he got from a hunter from the Midwest that was what leads to his accidental ingestion of poison because he did not think game preservation was going to be different in Alaska. But what makes this film worth watching is its musical score which ties the audience to the characters and really makes you feel for each character and be affected in a similar way by Chris/Alex."

His outlook of life was very different or maybe even far too elusive for some. There are scenes in the movie which depicts it well with numerous impactive lines. <br/><br/>Poor people want to be rich and rich people want to be richer.

He finally felt like a free man away from the civilization. He discovered his true self in the lap of nature. <br/><br/>Nature is beautiful but at the same time it can be harsh. Alaska was no exception. It showed no mercy on Chris.

","Into the Wild (2007): Dir: Sean Penn / Cast: Emile Hirsch, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Jena Malone, Hal Holbrook: True account of one's escape from their past or roots. Emile Hirsch abandons his wealthy upbringing and treks to Alaska without money. Structure chronicles the people he encounters and the affect he renders but he finds shelter in an abandon bus. Director Sean Penn creates realism, and like one of his previous films The Pledge, he sends the hero down a downward spiral of despair. Hirsch is excellent as someone feeling pressured within his upbringing and seeks escape. It is an experience in survival and consequence as he quickly adapts to a new lifestyle. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden play his verbally abusive parents who pushed too hard and face a future of regret and grief. Jena Malone plays his sister who understood him. She receives letters from him but she refuses to inform her parents of his whereabouts. There are numerous notable cameos of actors portraying those Hirsch encounters and impacts with his story. Perhaps the biggest standout is Hal Holbrook whose bond with Hirsch is so strong that he views him like a son. The conclusion is hopeless making one wonder why anyone would give up the privileges of his former life to go into the wild of freedom, beauty, survival, despair, and ultimately death.

Along the way, he meets a series of people who change his life.<br/><br/>Its story is very deep. It's a story of following a path that you choose for yourself. I always like it when movie's have deep plots which make you think. Christopher says that he feels career's are a 20th-century invention and he wants no part of that and I sort of agree with him. Its story is really important because it revolves around and talks about the opinion that many people have.<br/><br/>The acting is great from Emile Hirsch. Many of the other actors give superb roles as well. There weren't any actors who gave performances I had an issue with.<br/><br/>I don't think it's flawless though. There were very few scenes of survival in this film. I likely would've enjoyed the movie more had it consisted of something like 50% survival scenes and 50% flashbacks. However, what we got instead was about 85%-90% flashbacks. Also, the film dragged a little.<br/><br/>Also, on a side note, I recommend you don't read the critic reviews because many of them contain spoilers. I usually trust the critics, but in this case, I'd say ignore them and read them after you watch the movie.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, this is a great character study which contains great lessons and it may affect you greatly depending on what you believe.

","Haunting portrait of a young man trying to find peace and solace after leaving a home that had anything but it. Alaska, its wild frontier, is what Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) believes is the answer to his emptiness and desire for a life that has adventure for him. Sean Penn, as director, opts to go back and forth, showing us parts of the man's life prior to his death, at too young an age, due to a poisoned plant life plucked from the very nature he thought would be his salvation, while holing up in an abandoned bus (or the skeleton of what was once a bus; now just a shell that allows him to have a refuge of some sort).<br/><br/>We see his parents argue volatilely (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden), while he tries to shield his sister (Jena Malone) from its effects. Once he graduates college and his first real job goes bust, Chris decides to take to the open road, meeting the likes of hippies (Catherine Keener and Brian H Dieker) living within a commune, a teenage girl (a malnourished- looking Kristen Stewart), a company owner (Vince Vaughn) who gets in trouble with the law, and an elderly, genteel, Army veteran widower (who lost his wife and child to a traffic accident caused by a drunk driver) who works in leather as a trade for extra money (living off a decent pension). The lives of those he encounters are touched by his warm spirit and good heart, and the true tragedy of the film is the realization that he could have built a good life with strong relationships had he chosen to. Instead, he'll die alone, sickly, starving, and without a chance to say goodbye to the family that didn't know his whereabouts or plans. Malone gets some narration to dictate to the viewer the disappointment in not getting to communicate more with her brother when he was gone from home, pondering about what might have been. The storytelling structure Penn applies takes us to different points of McCandless alone and with people, as we see the mistake of not accepting what was right in front of him: a chance for a real family. Hal Holbrook got a much deserved Oscar nomination for his performance as a lonely old man awaken from his isolated life by this spirited young man who had a date with destiny. The expansive travelogue of the character gives Penn a chance to use locations across the map visually and aesthetically. Like any good road movie, the country of the United States offers much in the way of storytelling. Hirsch is a revelation in the lead; all that vulnerability and yearning for something of substance and sustenance in life drives him away from the potential of true happiness into a dying despair he cannot correct. Truly a poignant and depressing conclusion but what a story Penn has to tell. Good use of music by Vedder and company to factor into the various dramatic highs and lows of McCandless' life before his death."

","People have always told me good about this picture, and due to its presumably intelligent subject, I decided watching it last night. Chris is an apparently regular American guy, whose life was once designed to repeat the ordinary lifestyle. However, Chris doesn't agree with the American dream, and starts living his life in the nature. Obviously, he goes through some bad moments, which is usual to happen when submitting someone to a complete new environment. In fact, this guy never gives up on his dreams, and that's one of the qualities he has. The photography directing is amazing, developing plenty of beautiful and relaxing moments. Overall directing, on the other hand, isn't that careful. For instance, it feels extremely implausible to see Hirsch's character changing his clothes all the time-- especially because the clothes are very fancy. Sometimes it just seemed he carried a closet in his packs. As far as I know, people on trips tend to carry just a few things, otherwise, the bag would be too heavy to carry on their backs. However, this poor detail doesn't spoil the film's qualities, so I can surely recommend it to those who enjoy adventure movies, especially involving nature. Congratulations to the team!"

Jena Malone as the sister (and narrator) was the wisest decision made on this film. Malone really needs to be in more films, and this was a shining moment for her.

","I loved this movie. I never knew it was based on a real story until they showed his real picture in the end, and that really made me feel even more inspired and amazed. <br/><br/>I wouldn't call him a hero but someone that everyone can learn something from him and be inspired by him. <br/><br/>I admire his courage of leaving everything behind, giving his money away and living alone on the road which i guess it was scary but at the same time exciting. <br/><br/>I admire his beliefs, that money and generally society makes us so cautious and we don't get to appreciate nature and the small things in life that can really make us happy and that we can live and be happy even if we have little money or things. <br/><br/>I admire him for being hard working man even if he was born in a rich family, he always tested himself and he always wanted to do the hard works as Wayne told when he was working in his farm. <br/><br/>I admire him for his belief that happiness can be found everywhere and in anything we experience and not necessary from human relationships. That way we can share happiness with others without possessing them or using them, we can get to their core if we are happy by ourselves and really get to know them and make them feel happy and appreciate them.<br/><br/>We can learn from his mistakes too and get prepared for situations like living in the wild. <br/><br/>People who judge him for leaving his family have no right to... yes he was selfish but the good side of being selfish which is to follow your dream, create your own road, lifestyle. He wasn't' selfish at all as we see him giving his money away, working hard and sharing his happiness.. he was creating his life how he wanted. People who judge him selfish are people who have left their dreams behind because of parents or other external things like society and they are jealous of this man who did that. <br/><br/>I admire him because the road he chose was hard and uncomfortable and many people would never do that but he did making us think that what we really want to do is possible, we just have to go out and do it without caring about others thoughts. <br/><br/>""Many people die at twenty five and aren't buried until they are seventy five."" With that quote being said by Benjamin Franklin i think you can see that it doesn't really matter if you live long enough if you don't follow your dream cause you're already dead. Chris i am sure lived and experienced life for what it is, he was happy in every moment and he appreciated every moment, thing and everyone. He really lived unlike others who just exist... Just something to think about our lives because we all end up being dead , that's our destination but what matters is the journey.. and the journey is written by our actions. So be sure to live a happy and meaningful journey."

","This movie depicts the dream of most of us, despite the wrong reasons its being done for. I enjoy all the great sets and locations all across the USA I this movie. What's even greater is that the movie interacts more with the location, not just like any other movies which only take the location as a background picture. I really like how the movie uses the length of its duration to really emphasize the story into building up the details such as the characters and background story. The movie is indeed a great experience in watching. It's quite rare for me to give a score rating of 8 and above, but for this one, I was certain after watching just about a quarter of it. Emille Hirsch did a nice job in staying the fit and total for this movie. Jena Malone did just enough of a presence and help the flashbacks get a better sense to them, Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt acted the completing set for the story nicely enough. Even supporting characters that Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart played had enough depth to pay attention to."

","On August 18 1992, Chris McCandless died in the Alaskan wilderness and his body was discovered a month later. He was a 24 year old guy who was born in California and who ended up graduating high school in Virginia and then went to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He was a guy who eventually went to Arizona and South Dakota getting rides by hitchhiking, living only off the land and working only small jobs or no jobs at all. He then goes off to Alaska in the very harsh, cold wilderness and seemingly very unprepared for the journey.<br/><br/>This is one of the most interesting death stories around and it is still filled with many unanswered questions. The story was later made into a non-fiction book Into the Wild in 1997 written by Jon Krakauer which later turned into a best seller. The film adaption came later in 2007.<br/><br/>A film adaption of this story to me would seem risky. It is a story based on thought and emotion and learning how to live out in the wilderness. He might have a fine acting career but it is little funny to see that Sean Penn directed this. Even more, Chris McCandless is more a mystery character to portray because we really never got many answers about him.<br/><br/>Well Into the Wild is full of ups and downs but it comes out well in the end.<br/><br/>I give credit to Sean Penn who picks the right Christopher McCandless in Emile Hirsch. Hirsch is an actor who can deliver all the emotions that this character needs to bring to the story. McCandless is hard to root for but at the same time, you should be interested in the character because he is like no other. Kristen Stewart plays Tracy Taro as a love interest who is ultimately rushed here and hers is a character you wished saw more of. Hal Holbrook plays Ron Frantz, an older generation guy who picks up Chris as a hitchhiker and forms a very strong bond with him. Even Vice Vaughn shows up as Wayne Westerberg, McCanndless' best friend in North Dakota. The cast is filled with old stars, current stars and unknown stars at the time but ultimately all play good characters. <br/><br/>Along the way, this is a film that works on atmosphere. From the seeing California nudists in the valley, to watching McCandless canyoning up the Arizona channel and to the Alaskan wilderness, culture shock comes into play here and that is not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>I don't see Into the Wild as high re-watch film because of it's sad subject matter. Still though, this works for fans of the book and also for people that didn't read the book for that matter. It is another way to look into one of the most interesting stories around."

","Sean Penn's adaption of the non-fiction bestseller ""Into the Wild"" by Jon Krakauer begins with an unhappy and unstable family. Affected by a gloomy environment at his home, Christopher McCandless, a young and bright 20-year old college graduate with a promising future ahead sets out in the search of a spiritual pilgrimage leaving behind all his possessions and the materialistic rat race. He also donates a huge amount of 24000$ Law School fund to Oxfam.<br/><br/>He travels like there is no end to his journey, he first drives west, and then north into the Alaskan wilderness. He sees himself not as homeless but as a person liberated from homes. He denies himself of all pleasure except subsistence. Emile Hirsch has given a remarkable performance as the young and candid McCandless. Being an uncompromising idealist, he once quotes in the movie - ""rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth."" It is a serious and a personal movie which at times enthralls the audience with the spectacular captures of the nature and at other times drives you to introspect about what is more important , nature or humanity. McCandless' journey of youthful wandering, taking transient jobs, hitch-hiking becomes an exciting voyage of self discovery. He somewhere quotes in the movie - ""My life was more exciting when I was penniless."" He renamed himself as Supertramp because he feels so. His passion for the natural world and the fierce need of solitude drove him a long way and gave him the strength to stumble across all the dangers on the road to joy.<br/><br/>After two years, McCandless was found dead in the Alaskan backwoods in an abandoned bus he was using as an encampment. The last weeks of his life were spent reading books by Tolstoy. The solitary act of spending hours after hours reading the book is a point of interest in the film. Sean Penn has very beautifully not let out a suicidal character of McCandless, rather he has shown him as a victorious and an independent person. The movies comes along with a food for thought for the audience to think what has to be on a higher priority, humanity or nature."

","Into The Wild showcases in chronicling Christopher McCandless' willful transformation from moneyed college graduate to roaming vagabond on a penniless quest to Alaska, Penn turns Krakauer's exhaustive journalism into pure cinema. While the narrative is strong, it works in glorious harmony with Penn's free-form visual generosity. The first 20 minutes or so are filled with beautiful images of nature and there's sparse exposition and dialogue, with shots that feel plucked from the cutting-room floor of Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven. This will drive some viewers mad, but they're probably the same people who grow bored with long, descriptive literary passages.<br/><br/>An astonishing Emile Hirsch, channeling the looks and intensity of a young DiCaprio, portrays McCandless, the troubled grad who, rather than the follow his bourgeois parents' (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) path into an Ivy League law school, decides to torch his money, abandon his car and all material possessions, and explore the American landscape on a journey to a symbolic Alaska. He encounters a couple of bus-driving hippie throwbacks (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), a pair of friendly Scandinavian tourists and a farmer who offers him work (an oddly cast Vince Vaughn). Backstory is revealed intermittently and elegantly through the narration of his sister back home (Jena Malone), and we gradually come to understand the psychological impetus for Christopher's escape into a nut-and-berry-eating, hunting-and-gathering regression. Long but never rambling, the story eventually finds Christopher meeting up with a widowed old-timer (Hal Holbrook, surely a lock for Best Supporting Actor) with whom he bonds in tender and poignant scenes.<br/><br/>The movie's tones and textures are so well-captured, the ambiance so authentic and the performances so subtle and genuine that the characters' emotions – euphoria, freedom, danger, nausea – become ours, in a poetically realized and harrowing vision of one man's incompatibility with the modern world.<br/><br/>All of the movie's potentially dubious tricks work: the way the gripping text from McCandless' journal flows across the frame, making us hang on every word; the screenplay's wise adages, exchanged not as false, homespun platitudes but the grizzled truth of lived experience; and the score by Eddie Vedder, whose normally agonizing warble becomes a mournful cry from the protagonist's soul."

","Movie review<br/><br/>The movie ""Into the wild"", directed by Sean Penn in 2007, has a length of 143 minutes and is a dramatic and adventure movie. Chris, played by Emile Hirsch, is the lead character and 22 years old. The movie stars with Chris' graduation from college. While he is having lunch with his family, his parents tell him that they want to buy him a new car because of his graduation. But he does not want them to because he likes his car he has. Chris wants to live without money. He decides to leave. He burns his money and changes his identity. While he is tramping he gets to meet Jan and Rainy. <br/><br/>Then he goes to a farm, where he earns some money to fulfill his dream. After that he paddles down the river to Mexico with a canoe and meets some people from Denmark. Later he goes by train to a big city, back to society but he did not really like it there. Then he leaves the city by train again. He meets Jan and Rainy again and lives with them in a hippie village. There he meets a girl. They become friends and the girl wants more than just to be friends but Chris does not think the same way. After a few days Chris leaves the village and gets to meet Ron on his journey. He is like a parent to him. At last Chris goes to Alaska, where he has wanted to go for a long time. There he finds a magic bus, where he lives a few months. He finally lets his dream come true. He lives alone in the wild. But Chris dies by an accident. He accidentally eats a toxic plant and dies. <br/><br/>In this movie there are a lot of high-angle shots. This shows that Chris is so tiny in this big nature and Chris looks weak against the nature. There are also a lot of extreme long shot that give the viewer the feeling of freedom because nature is so big, quiet and nobody is there. <br/><br/>The message of the movie is that you need someone to be happy with, if you live alone away from society. The location is the whole time the nature which gives the viewer the feeling of reality. The movie gives me the impression that Chris is happier with other people around. And it also creates suspense in the end when Chris is getting skinnier. In my opinion the film is good to show how necessary social connections are and that you can't live alone in the nature when you don't know every plant and animal. But I find it really impressive how Chris follows his dream even if he doesn't go back to his family. I also think that such a journey isn't something for a long time, because it is normal that people need social contacts. I would do a journey like this in the beginning when Chris meets new people but I wouldn't burn my money and my identity. All in all I would say that the movie is very interesting and when you know that the movie is based on a true story it's more interesting."

","The movie ""into the wild"" directed by Sean Penn and released in 2007 is an adventure movie with also dramatic scenes. It has a length of 142 minutes. It's about a young man named Chris alias Alex, played by Emile Hirsch. It's based on a true story.<br/><br/>Chris is a young man who has just graduated from college. His family has got much money, but he doesn't need material things. He burns his money and his identity and begins a journey with the destination Alaska. He changes his name into Alexander Supertramp. On his trip he meets some hippies, works on a farm, paddles down the Colorado River to Mexico and takes a train to U.S. City. Besides he lives in a hippie village where he meets a girl. Near the end he meets an old guy named Ron, who's a parents figure to him. He goes to Alaska, where he finds an old bus, he calls it ""The Magic Bus"". He lives there for a while, hunts animals and writes a diary. At the end he eats some toxic plants from which he dies.<br/><br/>The director gives impressions of the nature to underline how much freedom means to Chris. The director mostly uses a bird perspective to show the beauty of the nature. Furthermore he puts music to the movie, mostly songs sung by a man with a deep voice and the lyrics are about a trip or an adventure. With the music he wants to make the audience feel like Chris does.<br/><br/>In my opinion it was a great movie. A movie which shows people that money can't buy happiness. Today nearly everybody needs material things to survive, not everybody can see the beauty in other things. On the one hand I think I wouldn't like to go on an adventure like this, because people need an attachment figure to not to go crazy. I also would be afraid of what the nature and the loneliness can bring and what it would produce in me. But on the other hand I think that a journey like this will have a big impression in someone's life. It has a message and gives a reason to live for. But I think I wouldn't be brave enough to go on a journey like this. I wish I could go away and travel around the world, but I want to meet new people and new cultures and I don't want to be alone in the dangerous wilderness for a long time. It would be fine for one day, but not for longer. To put it in a nutshell I think that it's a great thing to be alone sometimes, but you can't go away without telling anybody and without knowing how you make somebody feel with your actions. If you're brave enough than you should do it, but you have to think about it very well."

","When I watched this, I was sitting in my barracks in Afghanistan. I had to keep pausing this and going out to walk the tiny FOB we had there, just to take in what I had watched. I even went on two missions before I had finished it the first time, getting into combat during the intermissions. Believe me when I say, this movie was affecting my life more than what was going on around me, and that is no small feat, given I was in a war-zone.<br/><br/>There is no small amount of 'go back to nature' movies out there. Some are downright disdainful of the urbanized world. This movie isn't that. It is a meditation on the life a real man, who abandons his upper- middle-class career trajectory to become a tramp and eventually live in deep Alaska for awhile. He learns a great deal along the way.<br/><br/>Transcendentalism runs deep in the American psyche. Though we ignore it, that theological position is what drove the creation of many schools of though, including non-violent protest (ie Gandi and MLK). This man takes up the task set by Thoreau in 'Walden' and expands on it with the new quintessential American thought - the road, but he doesn't stop with these things. He learns one of the most powerful lessons I have ever had the pleasure of observing, and it is merely a scribble at the end.<br/><br/>One other thing about this movie: the music is fantastic. Eddie Vedder has some of his best work in this, most of which (I would dare say) is better than anything he did in Pearl Jam. Also, the cinematography is so well done that it ought to be used as an example of how to film such movies."

","The acting in this movie is really great. This is obviously an important element, but even more so in movies of this genre. The images were great and well directed. The story is simple but strong and based on a real life story and the movie also feels real, which is a great accomplishment. <br/><br/>I think many (young) people sometimes dream of leaving their, at times, boring and meaningless life behind and go for adventure. So I think in that regard most of us can identify with the main character. Personally I have though about this idea quite a lot, but in a different way than the main character who wants to flee society into the wild. I'd just start a new life in a different country rather than flee society, like most of us dreamers I think.<br/><br/>I found this movie depressing from the very beginning to the very end. The whole time I have this feeling that the main character is looking for something that does not exist. Every time he has a new ""home"" he suddenly moves on to accomplish his dream. The movie is very touching, made me feel empty but leaves a great message behind. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie."

Best 160 Mins of my life by watching this adventure experience. Making new friends, exploring the Natures , surviving with natures, seeing things in your own & different way – that would just be awesome. Whenever an adventure begins , the new people we meet will always leave their mark in our heart. Those people are rare to see, but yet they are unforgettable one's. As it's based on true story I don't want to see the logic things here. The last 15 mins are so touchy. Emile Hirsch last 5 mins acting were unbelievable.

","I read about this film in a magazine. This was now some years ago, so this review is with years of thinking.<br/><br/>I was struck by lightning. Partly for personal reasons, McCandless does something that I considered doing, and if I had followed that path could have killed me. I choose to comply to the demands of society. McCandless did not and he payed the ultimate price.<br/><br/>The story did not follow the book written by John Krakauer (and I strongly recommend to read it) but having seen the film first it does not loose much. Possibly that McCandless was really not experienced enough for what he did and that he could easily have survived if he knew...what he did not know. Reading the book, you realise the actual incompetence of McCandless wilderness adventure. In a way the movie captures the inner driving force of MacCandless when the book adds value in being more analytical and trying to understand all aspects of the events. <br/><br/>Krakauer got fascinated by the story for very personal reasons (he is BTW possibly most known for the climbing book ""Into thin air"", about an Everest climb).<br/><br/>We see a young Emile Hirsch at his best, he is perfect for this role. McCandless parents for real where at the filming and the guy driving him out into the wilderness in the film is the one who actually did it when it happened. Goosebumps..."

","It's amazing how the moral blindness of modern culture obscures the plain meaning of some people's stories, even when they're held up right before our eyes as examples! <br/><br/>Into the Wild proves that our moral sensibilities have become so twisted toward the glorification of human autonomy and self-realization that we cannot see what is right under our noses: namely that Chris McCandless was an almost biblical example of self-centeredness elevated above everything else in life and its consequent self-destructiveness.<br/><br/>But our society sees only a free, independent spirit; a hero of our modern stupidity. Sean Penn predictably holds Chris up to us as an example of authentic living; a bold pilgrim of human self- fulfillment. How tragic, and how blind!<br/><br/>Chris suffered some emotional abuse at the hands of his parents, who are stereotypically portrayed as hypocrites, drunks, and phonies. They were more likely just fallible human beings like the rest of us, but Penn indicts them as unforgivably shallow and unauthentic people—the unforgivable sin! So Chris feels he is justified in escaping from their evil influences and abandoning all ties of family and friendship, striving toward the holy grail of pure autonomy and authentic existence, eventually challenging himself with living alone in the Alaskan wilderness with nothing but his own physical and mental resources to keep him alive.<br/><br/>He certainly would have been better off challenging himself to come to terms with his own human fallibleness and hypocritical tendencies so that he might be willing to forgive his parents' mistakes and character flaws; but no! It was all or nothing for Chris. He was convinced of the absolute vindication of his cause, and there was room for no one else in his vision of a perfect, solitary, independent world.<br/><br/>It is ironic that this pure and absolute independence finally depends on an abandoned school bus as his final shelter, and a field guide to edible and non edible wild plants to allow him to safely live off the wild.<br/><br/>In his foolish arrogance, Chris assumes he can get along without help from anyone else. He wastes the life of a moose, not realizing that the animal represented far meat more than he could either consume or preserve for later. Despite his best attempts to larder the meat by using a method someone told him about, the meat rots and becomes food for wolves, maggots, and other scavengers, not him. He is grieved and guilty about the waste, but is helpless to prevent it.<br/><br/>Tragically, Chris learns a final, fatal lesson about the bankruptcy of his assumptions when he eats the wrong wild potato plant, realizing too late that the wild not only contains peace, bounty, and beauty, but the same potential for violence, pollution, and death that he assumed he was escaping from when he abandoned his family. The toxic plant disables his body's ability to process vital nutrition. He suffers miserably for many days before starving to death alone in the abandoned bus in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>If you've bought into the heroic interpretation of Chris's odyssey, caveat emptor!"

","I really enjoyed watching this film. It was great done, with the precise and fundamentally perfect choice of soundtrack as well. It was an eyeopener and a visual sight of the real world outside the (social society). The feelings, actions and decisions that Emile Hirsch's character makes really make you think about your own situation as well as his. I felt all the way through the film that I on some level could relate to the character and I think a lot of people can as well! It's a great cast of people within it. The actors chosen for the parts do an excellent job. Emile Hirsch really captures the soul of an adventurer. Vince Vaughn makes an excellent performer as a farmer as well, where he seemingly gets to take some of his own characteristics with. <br/><br/>A really great movie- you'll think about afterwards!"

This world belongs us and I wish we would travel all around the world like Chris McCandless. In the film you will discover world, nature, real people lifes. Also sharing is very important and in this film many times people share with Chris McCandless. They share their food, goods,house,money, and everything he needs.

"kottochagg","Null","0","1","26 December 2013"," Entertaining, well made, has its insights but it's not ideologically consistent.
","The film tells a story of a young man who's unhappy with his life. Society, consumism, family, hypocrisy. He 's tired of all the stuff he has to bear living in society. He decides to run away. He packs what's enough for him to survive and he walks. He walks, leaving everything behind, without looking back.<br/><br/>The beautiful photograpy and interesting storytelling, which is based on Alex's sister perspective, welcomes you to run from everything along with him. You catch yourself in the wild with Alex, leading a life in solitude, meeting all sorts of people and beautiful places. You now take a look around your life and see excess, work, fear, hypocrisy, emptiness, things, things, things. Alex teaches us that happiness lies on the simple things. You now catch yourself thinking that you would never have the nerve to drop everything and get immersed in the wild life. Towards the end, Alex realizes that happiness is only real when it's shared. So we have an open question. <br/><br/>The truth is: happiness is where the thought is not. They're unable to coexist. You have to be free from the addiction of thought in order to be happy. That's freedom. Wild animals don't seem to get depressed. Since the neighbour's garden is always greener, Alex must have had felt really happy at first. It wouldn't last, though. And why's that? Your ego, that is, your network of thoughts, tells you that if every adventure you have, every beautiful view you look at, every ingenious move you make to survive won't seem to be worth it if you don't let people know you did them.<br/><br/>Life in society is no good. All right. But what other option do we have? It seems to me that Alex found happiness and then turned up to be wrong. It does not provide you any answer. It's just about this guy who's having an adventure, in his search for happiness. It makes you question everything in your life: your relationships, work, beliefs and then leave you in a void, all by yourself, without any consistent answer.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it's really entertaining, it has good performances, the characters are very likable and it has a wonderful photography. Its narrative technique is brilliant, because it is told by Alex's sister. She's been through a lot of family problems along with Alex and she understands his choice of running away. So it helps the viewer to forgive Alex for his selfish choice, welcoming you to travel along with him.<br/><br/>Anyway, without any rankings or ratings, I would recommend it."

","First of all, what a beautiful movie!<br/><br/>I can really understand why Chris wanted to go away, wanted to be free. Of course it was selfish and unconsidered, but he just had to go. <br/><br/>I loved how they let his sister narrate parts of the story, through all the happy and beautiful moments it kept reminding me of his family back home. Jena Malone's voice was also perfect for this. <br/><br/>I loved how they showed his complete journey and how he bonded with all the people he met. The ending saddened me, during the movie I truly believed that he would still return home. Back to his parents, back to his beloved sister. I really wished for this, especially after the scene where his father sits in the middle of the road. Unfortunately happy endings are something more common in fiction than in reality, this movie really reminded me of that. Although the ending was sad and a little bit heartbreaking, the ending was also very befitting.<br/><br/>A movie that you must watch sometime!"

","Into the Wild is one of the most poignant, tragic, and, at the same time, inspiring movies I have ever seen. If you've ever had a spirit for adventure, or an itch to leave your life and get away from civilization, you'll understand why. Based on the real-life story of Chris McCandless, the film follows this twenty-something-year-old (Emile Hirsch) as he leaves behind his entire life, including his high-strung mother (Marcia Gay Harden), distant father (William Hurt), and loving sister (Jena Malone), as well as a very promising future, to trek across the country. His final goal: to live out a few months in the all-encompassing serenity of the wilderness of Alaska – his ""Great Alaskan Odyssey."" <br/><br/>Over the course of his adventure, the audience will be both struck down and uplifted, in large part because of the real, human performances of each and every member of the cast. Hirsch's McCandless manifests the idealistic dreamer in all of us, so dedicated to his values and so zeroed in on fulfilling his goal as to inspire anyone watching. At the same time, Hirsch is human, and McCandless's behavioral flaws, like his naivety and irrationality, are not ignored. Harden and Hurt's heartbreaking performances as regretful parents shine through in key moments as well. At one point, Hurt's character, typically the cold, harsh father, sits down in the middle of the road and simply cries, begging for his son to come home. The various characters that McCandless meets along his journey are arguably the most emotional aspects of the movie, if only because of how relatable each of them are. They reflect different shades of humanity that we're all familiar to: those afraid of following their dreams, or dismissive of passion, or so broken they cannot find the will to go on. And each of them is shown a new side of life by McCandless. <br/><br/>The raw, beautiful direction by Sean Penn is also admirable. The interesting dual narrative of McCandless's adventures on the road and McCandless's adventure in Alaska works to the film's advantage, highlighting the growth of his character. The sweeping landscapes of Alaska, in particular, are awe-inspiring; something as simple as wild elk rushing through the snow is enough to bring McCandless, as well as the audience, to tears. The original soundtrack by Eddie Vedder, with his booming voice and acoustic guitar, lend a hand in building this sense of camping, of tramping, of boyhood adventuring that pervades throughout the film. You can really tell that making this movie meant a great deal to Penn, who clearly tapped into his inner boyhood adventurer to create it. <br/><br/>Was Chris McCandless heroic in his pursuit, or was his whole venture a tragic, brash mistake? These are the questions the film leaves you with. Either way, the film will make you laugh and it will make you cry. It was made with such loving detail and direction that it's nearly impossible not to connect with it in some way. Every character reminds you of someone you know; every vista feels pulled straight out of one of your dreams. By no means was McCandless a perfect person, but his eagerness to follow his heart and determination to find pure truth, pure happiness, should serve as an inspiration for anyone to do the same."

","Based on the Jon Krakauer non-fiction bestseller about Christopher McCandless(played by Emile Hirsh) a young man who had just graduated from college in 1990 who decided to put his future on hold to fulfill a personal ambition to hitchhike to Alaska(after abandoning his disabled car) in order to survive in the wilderness on his own, living off what he can hunt and gather from the land. Along the way on his two-year journey he meets all kinds of people like Ron Franz(played by Hal Holbrook), a lonely old man who wants to adopt Chris, but he politely refuses, since he isn't orphaned, having two worried parents(played by William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden) as well as a sister(played by Jena Malone) back home, who serves as narrator of his life, which will have a most tragic end... Superb version of the fascinating book has fine acting by all, especially Hirsh, and exquisite direction by Sean Penn. Does leave out certain (potentially) unappealing parts of Chris' personality, but well captures the yearning to be one with nature, and rebel against a modern society he dislikes.<br/><br/>Will resonate in particular with those tempted at any point in their lives to become such a homeless wanderer(knowing the undeniable risks involved), punctuated by his haunting final words from a postcard he sent: ""I now walk into the wild""..."

Eddie Vedder's stirring and poignant music adds thematic depth to the events on screen. Perhaps, the best cinematography, a guaranteed treat to the eyes.<br/><br/>The film most beautifully attempts to show the people Chris McCandless (Character) meets along his journey, who gently provide him with the wisdom he's so desperately seeking, and yet is so fatally unable (or unwilling) to recognize before it's too late.<br/><br/>I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely.

Those landscapes, that you see in the film, are almost real you can touch the leaves of every single tree, and feel the water on your body, i think that's enough to explain. Second, the cast. Hirsch, did a perfect job, interpreting the character that really existed, and he did everything he can in order to have McCandless' spirit in him. I loved his performance. I think that the only black sheep in the cast is Kristen Stewart, as often, she is very inexpressive and she can't do her job even on such a secondary role, that what's she plays in the movie. And the music i just... I'll just say that is supervised by the leader of Pearl Jam, Eddie Vedder. I think that this movie, is a must see, in your life, i don't want to spoil anything, because life is just to personal, and this movie is a slice of you hidden (or maybe not so hidden) life.

","All these years, The Dark Knight (2008) has been my favorite movie. After watching Into the Wild though, I may have to reconsider. <br/><br/>Based on the eponymous book written by Jon Krakauer, Into the Wild is the true story of Christopher McCandless; a graduate from Emory University who gives up his possessions and sets out on a journey to Alaska. Self proclaimed as 'Alexander Super tramp', he roams the countryside searching for solace from his violent parents and the demanding society. Armed only with a backpack having few tools and a burning desire for truth and simplicity, Christopher ends up finding both through overpowering experiences.<br/><br/>Best described as a travelogue, Into the Wild is a hard-boiled account of a man who dared to do something we all yearn to do – escape the society. Eric Gautier's sinuously mobile camera supplies the film with breathtaking visuals of Alaska. It lends an artistic feel to an already well-made product, taking the film to a level that renders the audience helplessly awed with its creative rawness. <br/><br/>Yes, the cinematography is THAT good. Everything Christopher encounters or touches is a part of his journey; the journey to a life of primitiveness. Director Sean Penn offers infinite moments to make you feel Christopher's suffering, his freedom and his happiness. Eddie Vedder's background score adds to the emotional potency of each scene, and makes watching this film a truly enriching experience. <br/><br/>Often branded by his critics as a suicidal thrill-seeker, to me Christopher McCandless' philosophy which led to his asceticism is quite simple. He was just a person who had too much of the society and wanted out. Emile Hirsch delivers a remarkable performance; hitting all the important notes on the graph of character nuances. There's a subtle ingenuity in his acting: he obediently devotes his body, mind and soul to this role and makes sure that it stands out as a towering central performance. Everyone in the supporting crew performs reasonably well, especially Hal Holbrook as the old and lovable Ron Franz. You may argue that you have already seen more than half a dozen films which take digs at society and promote anti-consumerism. Into The Wild drives the same car but hits the gas too hard; so if you are willing to take it, you're in for a spellbinding ride. <br/><br/>Into the Wild is not for the squeamish, or for the ones looking for light-hearted entertainment. It is a no-nonsense film about the struggle and determination of one man. Mammoth-sized, both in length and scope; this film is a riveting piece of cinematic achievement which will be looked upon as a classic in the years to come.<br/><br/>I am still shaken by the intensity of its crushingly moving climax, and I cannot help but feel indebted to the whole team behind this film because they lent their creativity and effort for a higher cause: making the world aware of an indomitable spirit, a real human being. A film then, about a real human life – a life worth celebrating with the reverence it deserves. <br/><br/>As Jack London put it, ""It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild"" (White Fang). This quote says exactly what Chris was up against – what he knew he was up against. He wanted to live simply, in the raw, harsh wilderness and he did. People describe his Alaskan odyssey as 'tragic, stupid and inconsiderate'. I can almost see him smiling on this urbanized pot of pollution and social botheration, which we now call the 'modern world'."

","Other than the scenery from Atlanta to Alaska, this movie is beautiful. The story of this young man, Christopher Johnson McCandless, giving up all of his money and possessions to simply live in the wild is both touching and inspiring. The ditching of communication so suddenly with his family is not an inspiring part of his story, but the journey he goes through and the people that shape his life change his feelings towards how he left and really make him think about what he was doing. Ever since watching this movie (and reading this book) I've come to study all about this man, learn everything that is out there to learn, and even ace 2 projects and a test on him. This movie ultimately shaped my life and made me think about the simplicity of living and how much we take for granted.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. Sean Penn did an excellent job directing this picture. He himself is an amazing actor, but I believe this is his best direction. Emile Hirsch not only looks just like the young McCandless, but really did an outstanding job portraying him. Going from dorky-but-lovable Matthew Kidman in ""The Girl Next Door"" to confused transcendentalist Chris McCandless in this movie really pushed him up to my top 10 favorite actors.<br/><br/>The scenery is beautiful, shot in each state that Chris traveled to. The soundtrack is another thing that makes this movie so beautiful. Eddie Vedder did a perfect job producing a sound that makes you feel something when listening to it. Even now when I just simply put in my earbuds and look out my car window I reflect on Chris McCandless's story and wonder what life would be like living like that.<br/><br/>This movie was truly inspiring and will most likely remain my favorite movie for years to come. 10/10.

","Into The Wild showcases Sean Penn's talent for film-making, taking the spectator on an emotional journey into the true-story life of Chris McCandless. I decided to watch this film after hearing great things about it, and for the most part, loved it. <br/><br/>Whilst McCandless's motives for leaving society and his family behind as he embarks on his adventures seem reasonable and understandable, you soon come to realise that his actions are essentially selfish and unfounded. His loving sister with whom he shares a close relationship is left out of the loop. You being to sympathise with even his parents, who are essentially to blame for McCandless's alienation.<br/><br/>By the time I had finished watching, I was angry. Angry for the people that McCandless left carelessly on the roadside of his life; angry for his purely selfish motives in choosing to disengage entirely from his family; and angry that I had been duped into thinking the story had a happy ending.<br/><br/>True stories rarely have a happy ending, and Into The Wild is no exception. I am torn with what to make of it, never has a film taken me on such an emotional journey, and left me feeling totally dejected at its outcome.<br/><br/>I recommend it, but at the same time I hate it.

I was in love the second I saw it, and I've seen it several times after wards. Emile Hirsch is incredible good in this movie, and is both charming and interesting. Sean Penn has done very well with the casting, and directing. But what captured me most is the message of the movie, the simplicity of life that we've lost. Simplicity is so beautiful. So real. It is sad to see the world being so greedy and focused on having things. Materialism. McCandless seeks the truth and purpose of life throughout the journey. And I believe he found something greater than he expected. It was an eye-opener, for me, to understand what I really need in life, and what I can perfectly live without. What is important, what to worry about and these real things. That gives life meaning. The truth. Simple. <br/><br/>I could go on about this, but all I can really say is... watch the movie."
"kritikakis","9","0","2","22 April 2013"," This is not about ""social criticism"" at all
","I do not think this movie is about criticizing society or the parents etc. It is ""based"" on a true story, not the story itself.<br/><br/>I see Christopher afraid/unsatisfied, because he wants to do something that is entirely his own, without the help of others or the continuous help of the towering figure of the genius father. A desire to be as independent as possible, not from civilization (he uses a gun to hunt), but from the people he knows. He wants to create his own society and his own self, and challenge both.<br/><br/>Yes, he is naive, but that's not a reason to criticize him. In my life I have seen most entrepreneurs and investors analyze all the risks before jumping into a new business/investment, and the vast majority of them fail, even in a protected environment, and they put others into risk as well. That is the nature of exploration in areas you have not lived before. Chris is not doing anything different than any daredevil, he just does it by himself, doesn't put others into immediate danger.<br/><br/>Chris wants to put things ""under his belt"", experiences that are his own, without the protective measures that others have already put in place. He knows this is not his natural terrain, yet he throws himself into it, with a childish enthusiasm. You know, sometimes it works. When the American rebels wanted to be independent from England, the vast majority of Europeans believed that they won't make it by themselves, without the protection and know-how of the king and Europe.<br/><br/>This is a very tender, beautiful and emotional story, and there's something about the acting, the cinematography, the plot, that kept me watching myself with admiration, even if I'm generally not interested about such stories or about Alaska. An excellent movie."

"zhuzongjie86","9","0","2","21 March 2013"," Into or out of the wild, go to pursue
","Into or out of the wild, go to pursue<br/><br/>Into The Wild is produced basing on a true story happened in the beginning of 1990's. The simple fact is a graduated young man named Christopher McCandless with high honor from Emory University abandoned his conventionally parental life, and left home without uttering a single word. McCandless was found dead for two weeks in an abandoned bus in Alaska. People including Jon Krakauer (the original writer), Sean Penn (both the editor and director), and Emile Hirsch (play McCandless) added their own ideas and understandings.<br/><br/>Sean Penn regarded the end of McCandless as the point of mature, and he filmed this growth into five phases: my own birth, adolescence, manhood, family and getting of wisdom. There're two main lines: one is McCandless' life in Alaska with the wild, and the other is the super tramp of Alexander Supertramp (that McCandless called himself) with her sister's narratives of his ever life. I have to admit I hate conflicts in real life but have a crush in conflicts in movie, so I'd like to pick up some fragments to share here in this movie. I'm writing this for recording my moods and feelings.<br/><br/>""Why would I want a new car?""<br/><br/>In the beginning, McCandless' parents want to make a graduation present for him. Most young Americans and Chinese would accept this kind of gifts with much pleasure. However, McCandless responses by asking ""why would I need a new car?"" and that's what makes our hero different. He's happy with what he owns by himself, and he owns his own thoughts and personality which is the most important thing.<br/><br/>McCandless is not a geek, nor lunatic, nor anti-social, nor an extremist, nor an aesthetic voyager, he just knows what he needs, at least he knows he wants to pursue. ""I've got to figure out what I'm going to do. I've got a lot of things to pack and organize here first.""<br/><br/>Yang Mu, a Taiwanese poet, who teaches creation, said ""there are 3 phases about creation: to feel, to pursue and to express."" Now most of people, especially in China Mainland, omit the phase of pursuing. They choose to express quickly just after feel. It's like most kids will accept the new car once parents offer. It's like most students will digest what school chews. It's like most net citizens transmit one piece of twitter once see one. For my part, that's one reason why less dynamics in the society and more fakes now. And that's why McCandless chooses to go to Alaska and names himself Alexander SUPERTRAMP. ""The core of man's spirit comes from new experiences.""<br/><br/>This is the first direct conflict between McCandless and his parents in the movie. I appreciate this part very much because you could see flawless performance by these players. And if you compare parents now with them in the end of the movie, you'll feel much sorry for them.<br/><br/>""Society"". <br/><br/>It impressed me a lot that Alex and a farmer from Eastern South Dakota roared ""society"" in a bar. I'm not sure Alex was understood right by others including that farmer or me, but I am sure we are all bonded by the society somehow, and the society is the same somehow.<br/><br/>Karl Marks distinguishes human in two attributes: natural and social. I say these two are so contrary that you have to sacrifice one for the other. Like Alex says, ""I don't understand why people, is so bad to each other so f**king often. It doesn't make sense to me. Judgement. Control. All that, the whole spectrumÂ…""And by people he means ""parents, hypocrites, politicians, pricks"". These people will never choose natural than social attribute, even just for once.<br/><br/>""You are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from human relationships. God placed it all around us. It's in everything. People just need to change the way they look at those things.""<br/><br/>As for me, I revere the power of society, and I'll say, I may have the guts to ask for truth, but never dare to leave the damned society.<br/><br/>""Happiness is only real when shared."" <br/><br/>After experiencing alone and away from society, Alex left ""Happiness is only real when shared."" in his notebook. Whether he's regretful or he finds the truth finally is out of our knowledge. Different people comment differently. The director chooses to believe Alex never regrets maybe because Sean Penn has the same enthusiasm or he has to consider more of commercial and social issues.<br/><br/>I believe what Alex's done is worthy. Some could say it's stupid to risk one's life only to get a truth of ""Happiness is only real when shared."" I say you're too stupid to see the happiness pursued by Alex. It's not the point that one knows the truth, but that one pursues it. <br/><br/>I like Alexander SUPERTRAMP for his wisdom, admire him for his courage, agree him for his pursuing truth, and happy for him for his discovery of happiness.<br/><br/>All in all, my point is that it's hard to tell it's good or not into or out of the wild, but it's certain that everyone has the right to go to pursue! And I hope go right now!! Because Some may ask, ""why act now? Why not wait?"" The answer is clear: the world could wait no longer."

What proceeds is his struggle for survival in the wilderness whilst walking a path of self discovery.<br/><br/>The effect his disappearance has on his family, most notably his parents , is particularly interesting as their lives are ironically transformed and towards the end you are hoping he will reconcile and return to his much changed family."

The movie show us a real story of a man who abandon all his possessions and let his good life behind and crossed America and Canada in order to go to Alaska and live in the wilderness.<br/><br/>Everything functions in a harmonic way, the acting, scenery, photography, and the music were simply amazing. Reasons to write down Into the wild in your ""Movies to watch"" list if you love deep and thoughtful films. This film somehow criticize our constantly increasing consumerist and materialistic behavior, as long as you're watching the movie you immerse yourself in the journey of the lead character and into a deep thinking about things that are portrayed in the movie.

I was particularly fond of the way Penn found ways to incorporate small details from the book, things I thought that would have to be taken out however, Penn made everything fit perfectly and I was truly impressed.

However, sadly, this may give some a romantic view of the harsh conditions of living without money, communicating with family, the trust of strangers, and the ability for a ""city dweller"" to live off the land. <br/><br/>Have a box of tissues close by, there are several points along the way where the story will evoke strong emotion (sad, but heartfelt and real).<br/><br/>It's definitely a powerful movie, that I highly recommend to all."

","Simply put, this movie is excellent! Emile Hirsch leads a great ensemble cast and portrays Christopher McCandless about as well as one can. It is a tale of a young man that chooses a simple, spiritually driven life over the materialistic life he witnessed growing up (in a dysfunctional household with an abusive father). It is aesthetically pleasing (including one of the best soundtracks ever, written and performed by Eddie Vedder) and very well acted. In a similar spirit to ""On the Road,"" it awakens the seeker that exists within many of us. It's narrated by his younger sister, with whom he shares a strong bond. It's beautifully sad.

","So yeah, good acting, good camera work, somewhat solid screenplay. But the ending of this movie makes everything that happened on the way pointless. I give one extra star for it being based on the real life story, otherwise it would have scored 4. But if the authors had courage to change the ending and ""edit the reality"", they could have gotten at least eight stars from me. So I'll try to not spoil here: the ending of a movie of this kind should have given meaning to everything that happened on the way. Instead, it takes away any meaning. Superweak move!

"paddymeharg","9","0","2","15 June 2012"," The Supertramp
","There are those that say this film is boring. I fear these are the kinds of people that say, ""Outside? What's that?"". Into The Wild is going to be one of those films you love or you hate and it will very much depend on your own personal views on life. <br/><br/>For me, I loved it, and some day I am going to follow in the footsteps of Christopher McCandless. It is a voyage that is best suited to the wilds of the USA as here in Britain it is quite hard to travel for 10 miles without stumbling across a village of some sort. There aren't as many panoramic views or long stretching highways or indeed as many strange but incredibly friendly people. <br/><br/>Emile Hirsch appeared from nowhere to claim the leading role in this film, perhaps being best known for the piece of drivel The Girl Next Door. Although Lords of Dogtown was quite good. Anyway, I like it when a film uses an unheralded name and to all intents and purposes Emile Hirsch delivers the goods in his first real leading role. <br/><br/>Christopher McCandless (Hirsch) is a recent college graduate and sick of the lies and deceptions of his constantly arguing parents whose only concern seems to be status. He could not care less for having a faster car or a posh girlfriend or a six figure salary. So he gives all of his money, $24,000 to charity, burns his car and vanishes with little more than a backpack, sleeping-bag and large bag of rice. <br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot and Eric Gautier's cinematography is stunning. But then, if a professional filmmaker had failed to capture the wonderful scenery of open America you would really wonder if he or she had chosen the right career. So often we, particularly us Europeans, view America as this fat hamburger eating loud obnoxious nation of slobs. In reality this could not be farther from the truth. America is a tremendously diverse country rich in different cultures and we can forget at times how vast the land itself is. Christopher McCandless takes us into the wildness of it all. <br/><br/>Along the way we meet some great characters and the casting crew did a great job of filling the roles with experienced actors with presence. One of my favourites was Jan played by Catherine Keener. On the surface she is a witty hippie full of the joie de vivre. However there are darker undertones that Keener hints at us until they are fully revealed and her subtle presentation should be praised. Vince Vaughn continues a line of comic actors who prove that they can be more than just a comedian. Although Wayne Westerberg (Vaughn) is still very much a Vaughn type character; loud, in your face and smelling a bit boozy, upon meeting McCandless we see he is scared. He likes the comfort of the society he's in and Vaughn does well in portraying this. There is a great cameo from Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz, a lonely pensioner with a huge heart. <br/><br/>The only unwelcome face, for me was Kristen Stewart who again presents a bland and non-smiling forgettable character. She serves as McCandless's brief love interest although to my relief he is sensible enough not to pursue her. <br/><br/>The journey and the people encountered are what drives this film. Hirsch is a joy to watch and successfully mixes a blend of naive happiness and lonely realisation. The message is clear; happiness is best when shared. Throughout the film McCandless opposes this doctrine and states to Westerberg, ""You're wrong if you think joy can only come from the presence of other people."" He is a character I can highly relate to and his openness and willingness is refreshing to see on the big screen. <br/><br/>This film was inspiring for me. McCandless throws away the map and the rule book and with no plan sets off into the world to experience for what it is, renaming himself 'Alexander Supertramp'. I have yet to talk about the best part to this film though. That is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is truly awesome and nothing I can say will justify it. You simply must watch this film. Then you must simply buy Eddie Vedder's CD."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","2","5 June 2012"," A good and of course also original movie.
","To be frank, I always thought that I would hate this movie, based on it that it featured a stupid concept in my opinion and because it got directed by Sean Penn, who I thought would turn this movie into something incredibly pretentious and dead serious. But of course as it turned it, it wasn't all that bad. It's a quite good movie, that still doesn't really speak to me but still remains an interesting watch.<br/><br/>The movie becomes interesting to watch due to the its main character. You get why he does things and sees things the way he does. You understand his motivations, whether you agree with them or not. So that makes the movie interesting to watch and all but just not a very compelling one either. At least not for me. I recognize that that's probably just my personal taste and most other people might still be grabbed by its story and all of its emotions.<br/><br/>It sounds strange but I probably would had exactly liked this movie more, if it was done a bit more pretentious. Some more artistic shots, some deeper meanings to some of its themes and characters. I at times missed that in this movie and feel that Sean Penn made a bit of a too mainstream movie.<br/><br/>Not that the movie is not original to watch though. It of course gets made interesting with its unusual story, that got based on true events, which also always makes a movie more interesting to watch, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Thing i didn't always liked about its story and storytelling were its many different character, that kept popping up for just a couple of minutes, before they disappeared completely out of the movie again. I get it that this was supposed to add to the sense of adventure and the feeling that the main characters was constantly on the move but it doesn't always work out too well, since the point of some of its characters just isn't always clear enough. It at times almost feels redundant and slows the movie down, also making this quite a long watch.<br/><br/>And just because he is Sean Penn, he got a bunch of good and big name actors to show up in this movie, which worked out positively, since everybody fitted their roles quite well. It of course mostly gets carried by Emile Hirsch but some of its supporting cast members also manage to impress, such as William Hurt and Hal Holbrook for instance.<br/><br/>So really, it's a good and interesting movie to watch, even though the story still doesn't really speak out to me personally.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This movie was very entertaining to me. It really shows the determination that some people have to accomplish goals they have in life. The film has many happy, sad, and exhilarating moments in it. The scenery is beautiful, and the actors play their roles very well. The ending was tragic because you see this man go through all these great experiences and finally reach his goal of living in Alaska, then he ends up dieing from a small mistake of eating the wrong type of berries. He was very educated through all of his journeys, and had a a good amount of knowledge before doing most things. Seeing him die of such a small mistake was upsetting, however it made the film seem very real. Those small mistakes can cost you your life when you are trying to live on your own in the wild.<br/><br/>Over all this movie is a great movie to watch. If your the type of person that likes to watch adventure films then this is a great choice. The story line is great, and their is never a dull moment. This might not be a movie that is fun to watch over and over, but it is one that is worth being seen."
"toll-8","6","0","1","9 May 2012"," A fascinating journey of a selfish and stubborn man running away from himself
","Before I begin let me just state that this film is based on a true story so I will mention the outcome of the film. If you know the story you will know the outcome and if you don't maybe you should stop reading, although I'm sure the outcome is pretty obvious.<br/><br/>Chris McCandless (Hirsch) is a young man who has just graduated from college and has the opportunity to move on to Harvard Law School, something his parents are extremely happy about. His parents seem to be of the pushy kind and the sort that believe that a career and money is worth more than humanity itself. It is shown that Chris has been lead down this path when he has dinner with his parents and he tells them he has twenty four thousand dollars saved up. His parents then go on to offer him a car but Chris' reaction to this, in that he rejects it outright, shows that he is a boy who wants to do it all on his own, so much so that once his parents leave him that is exactly what he does. He donates all his money to charity, chops his credit cards and ID, and burns any leftover cash in his pocket. He then climbs into his car and drives west as far as he can, before being wiped out by a flash flood. At this he sets out on foot in an attempt to realise a sudden dream; fleeing to Alaska and living in the solitary wild.<br/><br/>The film begins with Chris already having achieved his goal; he stumbles across an old bus in the middle of the forest and uses it as his home, he hunts for deer as food and ensures that the bus is in a good liveable condition. We then flashback to the beginning from when he set off to each character he encounters on his journey. All of this is intertwined with the present moment of him in the forest. Along his journey he meets hippies, farmers, travellers and a lonely old man who each give him something valuable for when he is on his own, be it an item or information. All believe that his dream is crazy and their gifts come with warnings. At the end each gift and each warning have a huge part to play.<br/><br/>The film does jump in the timeline. We see him meet a character, they give him his need, and then we move forward to the present and see him taking on this advice or trying to avoid their warning. The flashbacks build towards a happy dream that he is close to completing, and the present scenes in the forest show his depletion towards death. This man learns a valuable lesson of life as it drifts away from him.<br/><br/>This is the sort of film that I find frustrating; one because it is something I would like to do, I couldn't think of nothing better than getting up and heading across the country and winging it. On the other hand I couldn't stand it when he clearly begins to struggle but is too stubborn to head out of the wilderness and find a way to his parents who would happily pay for him to get home. This probably frustrated me more as I couldn't understand why he was doing this too himself. I really enjoyed the idea of his journey but he seems to be on a suicide mission.<br/><br/>Chris is not a likable character. I hate to say it as he technically was a real person, but he was selfish and willing to hurt anyone who got in his way. It is as if he gets him comeuppance at the end for following a stupid dream. The characters he meet all tell him this and all show good reason for him to stay with them but he won't. He has this idea that he will only be happy if he is alone. This is shown in a heart warming scene towards the end when he meets a lonely old man who sees him as a grandson, but Chris treads all over him and leaves him in tears. This was a huge problem for me in this film, I really disliked the character.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the acting by Hirsch wasn't good because he was great in the role. He showed his selfish, stubborn side at the same time as being likable to the people on first impression. He also lost a lot of weight to portray the role which deserves a round of applause. There is also a great turn from Hal Holbrook who plays the old man, Ron. There one final scene really is touching.<br/><br/>There wasn't enough in this film for me to say it is brilliant. Too much of it frustrated me and I didn't like the lead character. Some of the scenes seemed pointless which meant the overly long running time could have been slashed. It looks great and there are some truly touching moments, however it isn't enough to make me think it is a great film. It is simply about an arrogant, selfish boy attempting to flee his parents but all he really is becoming is just like them, bringing him to a worse off conclusion.<br/><br/>3 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","8","0","1","31 March 2012"," A Nice Hike
","The best directed movie from actor/auteur Sean Penn since 1991's underrated THE Indian RUNNER, this is a visually gorgeous travelogue showing the sites of America though the yearning eyes of Christopher McCandless, a suburban college graduate turned intrepid idealist who ditches everything – giving his law school funds to charity – for a trip to Alaska for what he considers the ultimate freedom.<br/><br/>Eventually, without a car or money, McCandless meets a hippie couple; a charming tractor driver; and a dear old man with a tragic past. Each character serves as a peripheral warning for McCandless that his ill-prepared trek might not be very safe, and even those not familiar with the true story can assume it's a one way ticket.<br/><br/>From riding a kayak through the Colorado River to climbing gorgeous mountaintops, director Penn shows more style than struggle for the main character, whose journey is mostly aesthetic and, backed by original music by Eddie Vedder, dwells in a glossy documentary style giving the isolated journey a much too rosy outlook. Except scenes in the ""present"" as McCandless resides in a junked ""Magic Bus"" in the middle of nowhere, Alaska, and eventually runs out of food and sanity.<br/><br/>With a determined scruffy puppy countenance, Emile Hirsch balances dedicated traveler and naive optimist decently enough. With mistakes equaling accomplishments, he's never shown too perfectly despite the heavy-handed narration by his sister, who subliminally compares him to the ever-quotable philosophers instead of a normal guy on an abnormal quest. His obstacles include skinning a moose before flies take over; getting stuck in Mexico; and the temptation to sleep with a sixteen year old Kristen Stewart.<br/><br/>Running at a breezy two and a half hours, this is a trip worth taking – and although there's a clear anti Capitalist message throughout, the film, made by a politically polarizing celebrity, is never one-dimensional or one-sided. Anyone yearning to escape from the drudgery of city life into the ""wonders of nature"" will enjoy this quest. There's a lot to experience with enough time for everything to matter.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","The great American actor, Hal Holbrook, was rightfully nominated for an actor in a supporting role in the film for his performance. The rest of the cast is first rate and Oscar winners include William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden. If you like Kristin Stewart, she does a very good job here as well. The cast is first rate and the writing is as well. The film's structure has a lot of flashbacks to the past of Christopher Candleless's life at home in West Virginia; his journey in America; and his time in Alaska. The actor, Emilie Hirsch, did an excellent job in playing the main character who seeks meaning in life without connection to society. In the film, we see what caused him to become the man he was and why he yearned a sense of freedom from money, family, and people in general. I haven't read the book but it's based on a true story about this remarkable young man who donated his life savings to charity and took off to see the country. The ending could have been better though with a follow-up on the other characters. Still, Jena Malone's narration and informative background history help us understand Chris's plight with life and his search for meaning like a modern day Thoreau or Ralph Waldo Emerson."

"thinkerv0","10","0","1","26 January 2012"," Alexander-The-Super-Tramp
","This movie is an experience worth having. The protagonist is one of the most adventurous of all on screen characters I have ever witnessed and his adventure is not in search of pleasure or treasure or love but rather, is a quest for freedom from the known, a journey undertaken to get rid of society and its rotten traditions and oppressions.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a true story of a man named Christopher McCandless. It's a story of a man who was sensitive and loved freedom. He has seen enough of society and wants to run away into the wild to live freely and he chooses it over anything else which his career might have offered him after getting graduated from college. His two years of hitchhiking-roaming makes him have experiences more profound than most of us have in our entire life.<br/><br/>The protagonist has many notable traits. He is sensitive, adventurous, courageous, gentle, and generous and loves truth. He changes his name to 'Alexander-The-Super-Tramp'. His changing of name, giving up of possessions, getting rid of savings and even last bits of cash so dramatically reminds of Indian Sanyasins and Sufi Faquirs. I realized that he is very much 'Living dangerously' in a Nitzschean way. I also recalled Herman Hesse's Siddhartha while watching this movie because in many ways Alex lives like a Shaman and undergoes many experiences similar to Siddhartha before getting wise. The movie is not about profound spiritual wisdom but it has elements of it, still you enjoy the adventures of Alex. You cannot fail to observe many things in this movie which look similar to Cast Away; but in this movie the protagonist chooses to live in the wild and it's never too much of an isolation except for last bit when he really feels trapped in the wild; whereas in the former film the protagonist feels trapped from very beginning and desperately tries to get out of the situation.<br/><br/>The natural scenery consisting of rivers, snow-beds, trees, fields, animals, mountains and azure skies is just wonderful. The direction is just astounding and so is the screenplay and it looks more so once you learn that Sean Penn had not directed many movies prior to this one, nor he had done many screenplays before doing this one. Kudos to him! The credit for this comely biography goes to Jon Krakauer.<br/><br/>The expressions on the face of the Christopher McCandless have an uncanny resemblance to those on the face of Ramakrishna Paramhansa. Yes, I am deliberately trying to mention this because of my assumption that Chris had attained profound spiritual wisdom prior to his death. I do not feel fully aligned to the philosophy of this movie (which seems equivocal at times) but it does not hinder me from enjoying it to the full and narration is very engrossing in my opinion. I highly recommend watching this movie to those who love freedom from the known. I highly recommend this movie to explorers; to the lovers of truth."
"roedyg","8","0","1","22 January 2012"," an ordeal
","This is a movie that is painful to watch. It is about 2.5 hours long. Like Romeo and Juliet you can see the dreadful end telegraphed long in advance. Chris is a charming boy, handsome, friendly, kind, heroically adventurous, idealistic, intelligent and a bit of a flake. The many people he encounters are a bit weird, but kindly too. The movie takes you all over the USA photographing some of the most beautiful and most desolate places.<br/><br/>I don't know how they did it, but Chris shrinks to a wraith over the period of months trying to survive in the Alaska wilderness.<br/><br/>The movie has some sickeningly corny Hallmark moments, such as when Chris and Mr. Franz laugh on the mountain, or his materialistic father and mother kneel in church. But most of the time the characters ring true, if eccentric.<br/><br/>Chris is exuberant like a little boy. Most of the characters in the movie all want to reach out and protect him, just as you the viewer do as well. But you cannot.<br/><br/>William Hurt as the stern father does a scene that should have won him an Oscar, where he just loses it and sits down in the middle of the road. The pain was etched on his face completely convincingly and in a way that was so painful to watch you had to look away.<br/><br/>The big surprise of the movie is even though Chris died at a very young age, he had more adventure packed in his short life than most people have in a lifetime. Because of that, his early death was not that tragic. Even Chris recognises this."

","Sean Penn's adaptation of the adventures of Christopher McCandless, who left society behind to aimlessly roam the western United States, find himself and try his hand at a life off the land in the remote Alaskan wilderness. At first preachy and morose, there's a tipping point early in the picture where I couldn't help but feel something for McCandless and his naive quest to subsist wholly on morals, philosophy and the kindness of strangers in place of tangible food and water. Presented as a sort of messiah figure, the errant youth touches the lives of a broad range of individuals over the course of his travels, preaches the gospel of live-and-let-live and uncovers the difficulties associated with the tramp's lifestyle in a society so concerned with protecting its citizenry from themselves. There's a lot to be learned from Christopher's path, both positive and negative, and Penn shies away from neither in this careful, convincing pseudo-documentary. It can be so enveloping at times that the sudden appearance of a recognizable actor or two along the way feels awkward and strange. A very solid effort with something to say, I only wonder if it may have been better served by a full cast of unknowns. Eddie Vedder's perfectly matched original soundtrack deserves a special mention."

","Top student Chris graduates Emory University, and promptly leaves his old life to pursue one in the wilderness of Alaska. This shows the impact this decision has on his parents and sister, as well as the journey. It doesn't tell you if he made the right choice or not, rather it leaves that up to the individual. This is based on a true story as well as a novel, and I can draw no comparisons to either(although I understand that the book has essentially the same events, if the tone is rather different). Along the way, this kid(a compelling Hirsch) meets a lot of interesting people, and albeit he tends not to spend very long around them(he's not looking for others, he's trying to get away from society), every character is memorable, credible, genuine and comes across as a complete person. The acting is all great. Standouts are Keener, Holbrook, Vaughn(no, really), Hurt and, this one might surprise you, Pre-Twilight Stewart(yes, these last years, we've forgotten that she used to exhibit talent. This is one of her best performances). He meets hippies, the lonely, the hopefuls and a few who have no sympathy for his situation. We see both sides of nature, the stunning beauty and the terrifying danger. It is gorgeously photographed all the way. The pace is good, and I wouldn't really call this excessive in length, in spite of the nearly two hour, 30 minute running time. It captures the mood of every scene and really keeps your attention. The humanity, the sheer emotion, comes so easily to this. No manipulation or melodrama. There is a bit of disturbing content, and a little bloody, gory violence(not gratuitous), nudity(full frontal of both genders) and moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of those involved in creating it. 8/10"

","This movie did not stick to the truth and is therefore antithetical to﻿ what the real Chris actually believed. The book and the documentary by Ron Lamothe are much better, because they stay very close to the truth of the story. For example, McCandless did not die from eating a poisonous plant, as the movie suggests, but from starvation. The relationship with the dumb girl Tracy was overemphasized. The real Chris did not burn all of his identification cards as he did in the movie at the beginning - they were found in a backpack which was found in Alaska following his death and which also contained a rough map of the area. The movie also makes him seem like even more of a butt face to his parents than the book did. The movie puts a huge emphasis on truth but does not stick to the truth; the movie is hypocritical and stupid. Some truth still shines through, but in the end the movie is a trashy and false account of a person's life."

","The movie is just great. From the start to the end well built and made.<br/><br/>The story itself is very interesting too. The philosophy what was leading Chris is a very difficult one and personally I would like to do the same, but here comes the bottom line. At the beginning of movie its mentioned he loved the characters of Tolstoy and some other writers I personally don't know (except Gogol but its not said by narrator).<br/><br/>I read a lot of Tolstoy and in his novels is always present the desire for abandoning society and go back to a more simple life. The only problem that Chris maybe never read the very last page of these novels, because Tolstoy was a realist and at the end of the stories his character must realize cant go back to the wild because we are socialized too much (the best example is: The Cossacks).<br/><br/>The end of his life proved this too. He was not aware enough to be able to live in the mother nature. While he followed his heart he was extremely selfish. I cant imagine how much his parents suffered, because of him.<br/><br/>Beside all these contradictions still a great movie and recommend to anyone for watching just to get outside of everyday life."
"IgnorantButTrying","10","0","1","3 October 2011"," What more could I ask for?
","A story that can change your outlook on life, cinematography that coincides with the plot beautifully, and a cast to die for. Emile Hirsch seems so innocent throughout the whole film even though he's hurting so many people. Sean Penn wanted to do this film for 10 years before he finally got the rights, so essentially he wasn't going to ruin the opportunity. Adventure films, to me, are the most ""complete"" films because they capture every aspect of a person's journey, life. Hal Holbrook's character toward the end of the film sums up the entire underlying theme of the film, can happiness be achieved alone? That question is answered at the end by Christopher Mccandless in a very direct way. I'm surprised Sean Penn wasn't featured as the father, but you can't argue with the casting of William Hurt."
"hollo-peter","8","0","1","1 October 2011"," A captivating drama from 2007.
","Emily Hirsch stars as the guy who decides to leave society after graduation. He leaves everything behind: family, friends, belongings; burns his ID cards and even gives the money on his savings account to a charity foundation.<br/><br/>You'd think the guy is a rebellious man about to give society a lesson. No, that's not the case. Surely he was not brought up by the most lovable parents in the world, but he was properly raised and he managed to get top grades at college; all the prerequisites of making a career have been met.<br/><br/>Yet, he decides to go into the wild. All the stuff he has are essential for his survival: clothes for each coming season, weapons to hunt animals and books; famous works of famous authors let each and every day pass in a way one can only consider worthwhile.<br/><br/>He meets various people upon his journey (hippies living on their own, also cut off from society, agricultural workers he joins to make some money, tourists from Denmark enjoying their free time whilst travelling the US, etc.), he befriends them, but eventually continues to prepare for the great journey: arriving to Alaska.<br/><br/>Emily successfully portrays a man who got fed up with the people of modern society: divorce between parents, backstabbing friends, hypocrisy given to you by a great many people and also he sees the victims of the so-called consumer societies - people who want more of those things that come in the form of a mobile phone or a car or a house.<br/><br/>Too bad the film takes place in the early '90s. One would think things have gotten better since that time but they have only gotten worse: our lives our encompassed by the internet, social networks and mobile phones - each of them is a means to be as ""far away"" from people as possible while trying to maintain a social activity by creating fake behavioural patterns. This film would be perfect if it had been made recently.<br/><br/>Regardless, it is a masterpiece cinema I can only recommend. Each character is lovable and although the film is slow-paced at times during its 150-minute run, it gives you a satisfactory journey (ending done well, likewise) and maybe, maybe makes you reinterpret your life.<br/><br/>I give it 8 out of 10."

Maybe you've fantasised about being shipwrecked on a desert island or possibly you like the idea about living in the woods or some empty valley, relying on nothing but your wits and instinct and surviving on whatever you can catch or forage. Perhaps few have; at the end of the day there is an overwhelming part of all of us that fears being lonely or isolated. I feel that too but I have also had a long term fantasy about living in the wild that I don't think I'll ever shake. And I suppose that is why I enjoyed this film so much.<br/><br/>There are other reasons too: the imagery and cinematography are fantastic; the acting is excellent, particularly from the supporting characters that the main protagonist meets along his journey (chief amongst them Hal Holbrook's performance as Ron); and the idea that this really happened – though an ultimately sad story (don't worry this isn't a spoiler) – is very appealing.<br/><br/>However, if any film I've watched in recent years has made me want to strike out and make changes in my life then it is indisputably Into The Wild.

He reasons that by being largely by himself and surviving on the bare minimum, he will find the truth and happiness that evade people for a lifetime. <br/><br/>The people like me who love this film find what Chris did inspiring and life-changing. For much of our lives we are slaves to money, working pointless careers just to buy things that, when all is said and done, are meaningless and unnecessary. Chris not only had the prescience to see the emptiness these things would bring, but the rare courage to escape them. <br/><br/>I have seen many, many movies and I have yet to find one encompassing the depth and beauty so brilliantly displayed by Into the Wild. It masterfully immerses the viewer in a deep philosophical place where we are forced to reflect on what it is we truly value in life, what truly makes us happy.

However, I could feel with the main character, but not really identify with him. But maybe this is exactly the thing that makes this movie interesting. Chris McCandless reflects the part of ourselves that would be ready to follow his path, while our common sense is pretty happy to be situated in front of a screen.<br/><br/>Finally, Into The Wild is a movie that you remember. Maybe not when you're on business lunch or on a shopping trip. But certainly there are this moments of time where you can see Chris McCandless walking in the distance."

","Based on a book by Jon Krakauer Into the Wild was passion project for Sean Penn, waiting 10 years to make it ensure he had the approval of Christopher McCandless' family before he could make it.<br/><br/>Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a recent university graduate who decides to reject society and materialism and goes travelling across America. He gives all his money to Oxfam and renames himself Alexander Supertramp and on the way he meets a variety of characters, including a couple of hippies, Jan and Rainey (Catherine Keener and Brian H. Dierker), a harvester, Wayne (Vince Vaughn), a young singer Tracy (Kristen Stewart) and a old man Ron (Hal Holbrook). He ends up in the winter landscape of Alaska, attempting to live off the land. At home he left no way for his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and his sister Carine (Jena Malone).<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a slow burner of a film, taking its time to show Chris/Alex's travels and the way it looked and felt reminded me of Danny Boyle, particularly The Beach and 127 Hours. There is great cinematography by Eric Gautier and sombre music. Sean Penn does have a good eye for imagine and scenes like when Chris/Alex was in Los Angles looking like when Richard was in the Ko Pha Ngan. The film itself lack a strong narrative structure but that is because of the story itself, Chris/Alex is wondering around Western America as he develops his skills and makes friends.<br/><br/>Chris/Alex is portrayed as a very intelligent young man, an avid reader and has a strong, if a little too rigid moral view of the world. But is also portrayed as an arrogant man, who is selfish and because of his view that he does not need human connections he does not realise how much he hurts the people who love and care for him. One of the main reasons he ran away was because his parents used to argue and nearly had a divorce: everyone's parents argue get over it! In the Wikipedia article they say his parents were unloving, but when we saw them they did seem to care about their son and want to see him do well, offering to buy him a car and match his college fund to go to Harvard Law. Also if he really believed against materialism, the modern world and the curse of modern society, why not go to somewhere like a rural African village and helping the people have a better live.<br/><br/>Asking wise I personally doubt Hirsch's abilities and I personally thought he was trying to be like Leonardo Di Caprio (ironically I found out on the trivia page that Penn originally envisioned Di Caprio for the role). Hirsch is good in the silence moments and will Penn's direction shows that a simple image or images can be more powerful then using lots of dialogue and it takes great skill for an actor to make it compelling. But Hirsch speaks in a monotone and he comes off as a pretentious rich boy. He is best when he is in Alaska. Malone also provided narration and both her and Hirsch lay it on thick with what they say but lack emotion. The rest of the cast are good throughout, Hurt, Harden, Holbrook (wealthy of his Oscar nod), Keener, Vaughn and even Stewart who is natural (but it could also be I liked her in her Daisy Dukes). There is a very strong cast in this film.<br/><br/>Overall Into the Wild is a good film and certainly made with a lot of passion. But it is not the classic piece of work some critics think it.<br/><br/>A Solid 4 out of 5."

This movie is based on the true story (which was first adapted into a book by Jon Krakauer) of Christopher who one day after graduating with top marks from Emory University, gave all of his $24,000 savings to charity and up and left his family to go and live in the wilds of Alaska. He did this without telling anyone where he was going and when, if ever, he would return.<br/><br/>This story is told from several different perspectives. There is the story of Christopher as he voyages across America meeting a plethora of different people along the way- this takes precedent, the story of him when he finally makes it to Alaska where he finds an old empty bus that he turns into his home and finally the story as told from the perspective of his sister who fills us in on the family background and the emotions that they were feeling during his journey. They are all interwoven and skip from one to another during the movie.<br/><br/>It is beautifully shot, especially with so many different locations and scenes to film. Sean Penn is the director and despite not voyaging into this directorial role often you would be hard pushed to realize. My only slight issue is that Penn sought to glamorize his journey when at times, he could be considered a bit of an idiot... ignoring flash flood warning signs, canoeing without a helmet, preparing for Alaska by reading a few books rather than getting the necessary equipment etc.<br/><br/>The acting of Hirsch is excellent and the thoughts and emotions, most likely gleaned from the actual Christopher, have been portrayed well. Christopher believes that he can get by without the need for relationships with other people but because of his charisma, people seek him out. (think Franco from 127 hours) Some might find parts of his monologues a bit preachy but I felt they gave depth to his character and helped to explain the reasoning behind his journey. The movie is well written and has it all- adventure, action, some comedy, sadness and most importantly it feels real- in my experience it is not often that a movie captures reality successfully without lacking at some point.<br/><br/>I have to say that this movie hit a chord with me for some reason and I found it to be excellent. You can just get lost with Christopher's beliefs and his ethos. He has done what so many of us would like to do but will never have the courage to. He disregards his money and possessions through choice and sets off on an adventure without a worry in the world. The fact that it is based on a true story only adds to the exceptional story that is told.<br/><br/>This movie will leave you remembering it for several days after and is one that will get you wanting to change the way you think and do things.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

","Sitting here with the excellent soundtrack from Eddie Vedder playing and I just wanna say that I disagree with every aspect of Sean Penn's politics but that being said I wanna say thank God for this movie. If you love stories about the questions of life, hard times and sacrifice you will love this movie. If you ever hitchhiked, read Even Cowgirls get the Blues, smoked, laughed and met that moment when you really FEEL life coursing through your veins, this movie is why movies are made. This movie crosses over the boundaries between conservative, liberal, urban, educated, rural. It is a truly honest American experience and one which many instinctively recognize as their own story. I doubt I'm going to live to see a better film. Thank you, thank you Mr.Penn."

","A beautiful and moving story. They have captured it perfectly and though it may make you feel you have done nothing in your life, it will make you want to get on the road and live your life. I would recommend this to anyone as it shows you what matters and puts life in perspective. The acting is great and the music is perfect. Eddie Vedders raw music is simple yet powerful. I've never seen another film like this and have watched it many times and still feel the same way. Never tiring of it. If you are free spirited and love poetry this will be perfect for you. Watching this movie did change me and no other movie has done that before. It showed me what matters, and broke down the system that was in my head that would control me"

","I read the book soon after it was published, in the mid-1990s, I think. It was an impressive piece of writing to chronicle the wanderings of the misguided Chris McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch) who finally decides to forgo all human contact in the wilds of Alaska. If nothing else, McCandless had the courage of his convictions, even if he was remarkably ill-prepared for his adventures.<br/><br/>Convictions, however, can come back to bite you, unless you're prepared to learn from experience and change your ways. In that regard, the film fails to deliver the whole story. Hence, I'd urge interested viewers to get the book from a local library and read it – if not all of it (although, it's a relatively short non-fiction narrative), then definitely the end.<br/><br/>The photography, though, is excellent. The acting by all the characters is very natural – indeed, almost flawless and with special mention for Hal Holbrook (as old Ron Franz) who has scenes with Hirsch that are truly amazing in their emotional effectiveness.<br/><br/>Hirsch, of course, carries the film and story. I'd not seen him before in a film; without doubt, however, he is excellent in the role. Though, it would be instructive to see him in another story and context. Sean Pen produced and directed this and did a competent job for a pedestrian (no pun intended) story that some say is overlong. Perhaps it is.<br/><br/>The film is remarkable for me from another aspect, however: with a total of fifty-four film locations, I think this film wins, hands down, as the one that's traveled to the most. Even the epic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) went to only thirty-two; and the other epic from that same year, The Longest Day, managed to get out to only a dozen or so. There is no Oscar for highest number of locations, though.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I think, this type of film would have been better handled by Werner Herzog, famous for many fiction and non-fiction films – particularly Grizzly Man (2005), a documentary about another young man who thought he could live with wild bears. That's a better movie story than Into The Wild.<br/><br/>However, if you want to see many barren and lonely parts of the USA, followed by the wild, forbidding beauty of Alaska, then do see this movie. Or, you could just see a National Geographic documentary, instead. For the whole story about Chris McCandless, though, get the book and read it.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for Penn fans, mostly, and nature lovers."

","Sean Pean directs the true story of Christopher McCandles, a. k. a. Alexander Supertramp, a twenty-something guy who left behind family, money and a promising career and start a solo trip around the USA to collect money and prepare himself for a solo expedition to the Alaska wilderness. The script is based both on his personal diary, his sister's memories, and those of the people who Chris met on the road.<br/><br/>Penn has surrounded himself with a group of great supporting actors, who are great in their respective roles. Emile Hirsch, the leading actor, offers a very powerful performance portraying Chris' free spirit and strong willpower with sensitivity and honesty.<br/><br/>The two and a half hours of footage really flow because Penn tells the story in a very fresh and light way, without losing content and depth in the way. The use of the camera mixes the subjective and the objective point of view, offering different tempos who suit well the viewing of such a long movie.<br/><br/>What does mean to be free? Chris knew what meant to him, and what to do and what to sacrifice to achieve freedom, to be himself. The overwhelming strength of Christ's spirit is superbly explored and presented to the viewer by an inspired Penn, who is true to the real wilderness of Chris' spirit, to the depths of his soul, without a mainstream teary approach.<br/><br/>A mesmerizing movie and story that left me in awe."

"jayjaymadigan","9","0","2","23 January 2011"," One of the best films ever made?
","This film will convey a lot of different feelings, there's happiness, sadness, anger, you feel part of the story, especially the second time round, and the film gets more emotional and deep each time you watch it, as you notice more things each time, and even though you know what's coming, you're in awe every time.<br/><br/>Some scenes make you laugh, cry, smile, and most importantly think, the scenery will wow you, its raw beauty in its self is a major part of what makes this film so special.<br/><br/>Based on true events, it follows the life of bored student, Christopher Mcandless, or Alexander super-tramp, leaving his boring, conservative life style in west Virginia, to travel all the way to Alaska, by foot, hitch hiking and the occasional canoeing through through Nevada, he meets people like him self, who shape his adventure, and shows you something you would forget in modern day society, that is, this world is full of good people, who will trust a stranger with open arms, warmth an most importantly, something Chris wanted his whole life, love and support.<br/><br/>He has a dis like for his parents, as they lied through his and his sisters childhood, a lot of it being a blur, a cruel, unusual blur, he meets many parent like figures who could of made his life happier from the start, in particular Rainey and Jan, Ron, and Wayne (played by the fabulous Vince Vaughn, showing not every film he is in is second rate rubbish)<br/><br/>I'd be lying if I said you would finish this film with dry eyes, and each time you watch it, the eyes get less dry, especially the heart breaking conversation between Ron and Chris in Ron's car before Chris leaves for the Canadian border, which is even more heartbreaking the second time wrong, after finding out what happens in the end, makes Ron's personal dream, impossible...<br/><br/>One issue is the casting choice of Kristen Stewart as Tracy Tatro, this woman is a bad actress, and makes the character seem nothing more than vulnerable trailer trash who will put out for anyone, the character is deeper than that, but she just moped about with her miserable acting skills, monotone voice, and blank facial expressions, and for the record, she cannot sing! apart from her presence in this film, it is wonderful, do not let her put you off it, i could and would recommend this film to everyone! see some beauty, and see some deep, true characters! is this one of the best films ever made? yes, it really is!<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>If Kristen Stewarts presence wasn't in this film, a 10 would be awarded!"
"tanelteder","9","0","1","3 January 2011"," you just live, man
","Into the Wild is a masterpiece by Sean Penn. The movie is very emotional. You have a very good chance to be moved by the life story of a young man who decides to fight against the system. The transcription written for him by his parents makes him feel like his life is already lived. It feels like everything so foregone conclusion. Like you don't have a chance to do things your own way and be surprised in life. A powerful drama.<br/><br/>The cast overall is great. Emile Hirsch (Chris McCandless) is perfect for the role. It seems to me that Sean Penn is at least as good director as he is an actor. I have seen the book by Jon Krakauer and I must say the screenplay is a nice job. Even better is directing. The beautiful nature of Alaska, Colorado, Nevada etc is amazing. Sean Penn gives us incredible views and that's a big credit to the movie.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is an inspiring movie. That's why I rate this high. Vince Vaughn (Wayne Westerberg) asks Emile Hirsch (Chris McCandless) what is he going to do in the wilderness of Alaska and the latter answers you just live it, man. And that sums up this film perfectly."

","Being a recent addition to the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book I got the opportunity to see this film and I wasn't going miss it, especially it being directed by actor Sean Penn. Based on the true story, twenty-two year old Christoper 'Chris' McCandless (Lords of Dogtown's Emile Hirsch) has just graduated from Emory University as a top student and athlete, but he abandons his normal lifestyle. He leaves behind his family, mother Billie (Pollock's Marcia Gay Harden), father Walt (William Hurt) and sister Carine (Donnie Darko's Jena Malone), all his possessions, and gave his entire $24,000 savings to charity. His life in twenty months becomes a series of endless walking and hitchhikes, like a drifter, under the new name ""Alexander Supertramp"", to reach his destination, the wilderness of Alaska. The story flashes forward occasional to where the place he has found to find self-discovery, appreciate the world around him and reflect on the ""unreal"" existence with his family. This location is situated in the middle of the Alaskan woods, inside an abandoned camper van, or ""bus"", and while we see him find new ways to hunt down animals for food and make it through the winter, it flashes back to see his life on the road. Along the way he meets various characters who shape his life ins their own individual ways, whether it be offering him a lift, passing on the road or river, or meeting him while stopping somewhere. These people include hippie couple Jan Burres (Being John Malkovich's Catherine Keener) and Rainey (Brian H. Dierker), harvest company owner Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn), teenager Tracy Tatro (Panic Room's Kristen Stewart), and possibly most significant, lonely retired leather worker Ron Franz (Oscar nominated Hal Holbrook). Despite surviving the winter, he finds the river he crossed is raging and he seems trapped, so with no way to get to animals he is forced to eat berries and fauna. He is devastated to discover from his book that what he has eaten is poisonous, and it causes not only nausea but starvation and exhaustion, and eventually he died isolated inside the bus, the text says he was found by hunters. Also starring the real Jim Gallien, the last person to see McCandless alive and The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis as Kevin. Hirsch gives a boyish but intuitive performance, Harden and Hurt do pretty well in their brief roles, the landscapes throughout make for great viewing, and the sense of wonder and sympathy for the lead character really resonate, a moving and certainly must see biographical adventure drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Editing, it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Guaranteed"", and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Michael Brook, Kaki King and Eddie Vedder. Very good!"
"hicflicksdotwordpressdotcom","10","0","2","30 October 2010"," One of my all-time fav flicks. This movie will make you introspect, and re-consider whether life is worth the chase. Do not miss, especially if you are feeling low or down.
","Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !<br/><br/>I happened to watch this film a while back, since it was nominated for the 2007 academy awards. It is a true life story based on the life of Christopher Mc Candless, a college graduate from the prestigious Emory University, who left his materialist and conventional life to foray into the wild in remote Alaska. The director of this movie is Sean Pean, who I admire as an actor, but he could not impress as much while directing his previous film viz. The Pledge. However, this movie clearly turned out to be a jewel in his crown.<br/><br/>The cinematography and visuals of the film is stunning and breath- taking, capturing the beauty of the wilderness in Alaska and a nomadic life. When I first read about this film, I thought it might be a waste of time. After all it was based on the life of some guy, who wandered off into the wilderness, and finally died due to starvation. But as I saw more of the film, I connected with the character, and started to digest the story he was trying to tell. The music is also enchanting and provided by Eddie Vedder (of the band Pearl Jam).<br/><br/>All in all, a must watch, especially if you are feeling tied down in life or going through a rough patch. You will come out refreshed and with a whole new perspective on life."
"MirandaSoft","9","0","2","5 October 2010"," I have the original article...
","In August 1992, I was stranded and abandoned about a ship in Atka, Alaska. Besides that, I have the newspaper, Anchorage Daily News, dated Saturday, September 19, 1992. On the Front Page, an article reads, ""Dead hiker ID'd"", written by Kris Capps. Apparently, I was stranded in Alaska during the final days of Christopher's life in Alaska. We were in the same State, but different locations. When I watched this movie, it brought back a lot of memories when I had lived in Alaska. I lived in Alaska from 1992 to 1995, and can ""visualize"" the life of Christopher, though I never met him. Since I had lived in Anchorage, many scenes in the movie were places that I've been to, a long time ago. My early life in Alaska wasn't nice to talk about, because I lived in a couple of shelters, and I remembered the McCandless news on KIMO TV 13. I remember the friends I made with Alaska State Troopers, and during that time in 1992, McCandless story was big news."
"SubZeroMK","10","0","1","24 September 2010"," Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen this decade.
","I don't know if anything else can top it. I mean, it's like I'm watching an Oscar performance and Planet Earth at the same time. This movie has some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. Well, I am a sucker for beauty in nature and that's what really convinced me to finally see this movie.<br/><br/>Emile Hersch does a terrific acting job, and his character is believable all the way. You kind of hate him at first because you think he's selfish and immature for what he's doing, but as you go along, you kinda understand what he really wants. To enjoy life. He had this note on his diary of his travels saying ""life was less hard when I was penniless"" or something along the lines of that. I couldn't help but think that he's referring to his child-hood. And if he is, he is so right. Life was easy for all of us kids when we grew up.<br/><br/>I don't remember having to worry about the most serious disease, about paying the bank on time or about my future career. I had the best time of my life, but that innocence is taken away from us once we reach a certain age in our lives. Like his was. I bet that's one of the reasons he set out on his adventure.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I said, I'm a sucker for beautiful locations, this movie really set the tone. One of my favorite parts was when he met Wayne and helped around the wheat fields, was it? Anyway, I loved that whole segment because it reminds me of my home in Europe, we all had to do the same thing if we wanted to have food on our table, but then the sunset scene where the sky was a beautiful tint of pink, and purple with a little hint of red. I LIVE FOR THOSE MOMENTS! I truly do. We may go to war with each other because we don't agree with something, but at the end of the day after we've killed each other off, we can find peace in the beauty of what nature, or Earth has to offer. He wanted to escape in it. He didn't care about material things, he just wanted to get the most out of his life. I sometimes was wondering if he did it to put his pathetic parents to a test, to see how far they would go to find him. But instead, they stay home and wait for the authorities to do their jobs.<br/><br/>This movie is truly unforgettable to say the least. It's on my blu-ray buy list and I hope there are many more movies like this. Emile Hersch can act and Hollywood needs to give him way more roles and a lot of money, because he's one of the few younger actors who isn't talentless and has class. I also wish to give my condolences to the real Chris McCandless, who sacrificed everything in his life to get the full experience of life. This is not a movie about being nice to one another, or being a charity center, it's a movie about life, nature and how to get the most out of it. It's a movie about the meaning of life, and Chris McCandless truly discovered that. May he rest in peace."

","I'd heard some good things about this movie, as a matter of fact, a LOT of good things, but I was never ready to watch it. I ended up finding it at a pawn shop for a few bucks, watched it, and was thoroughly impressed. I could easily watch this one more than once.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, with permission from Chris McCandless' (Emile Hirsch) family, Sean Penn writes and directs a story about a young man trying to figure out life. Seems like more and more Americans are doing the same thing no matter their age, so Penn has a story that several generations can relate too.<br/><br/>Chris leaves home after graduating college, tells no one where he's going, and leaves or destroys all his personal belongings along the way – except what he needs to survive. Making his way out west with only his backpack, he has many great ""human"" adventures along the way to his final destination, Alaska. His human connections are fantastic because he is truly connecting with the people he meets. There are no issues about time, money or social standings. The people he meets along the way are as true and rich in character as he is.<br/><br/>This is not a feel-good movie, this is a thought-provoking movie that will really have you questioning your personal lifestyle and what it really means to be human. Young Hirsch is completely believable and I'm seeing a few Oscars in his future. Gwen Bishop"
"pfeffera","10","0","1","27 August 2010"," An amazing movie.
","Into The Wild is by far one of the greatest film adaptations that I have ever seen. Whether it be the inspiration behind Christopher McCandless' epic adventure, or the adventure itself, no one can leave this film untouched. Being a lover of poetry and philosophy myself, this made the film ever-so much more enjoyable. Alexander Supertramp's (McCandless) determination and motivation to become one with the wild and escape the clutches of society was outstanding.<br/><br/>However, with all great things, come their minor flaws. Although this film represented the Jon Krakauer's book well, it also added many scenes and scenarios that were not originally present. I did not find them unnecessary for they added to the drama element, but rather not strictly following the book.<br/><br/>This film, despite it being a true story, shares a common character with many other movies. The misunderstood, teenage rebel out to defy the government and society in which he/she lives. Though Chris cannot truly be compared with any other individual, the theme of teenage rebellion plays an impact on the movie industry today. From The Outsiders, to Into The Wild."

"arvindragunathan","10","0","1","4 June 2010"," The great Alaskan adventure in search of freedom
","After a exasperatingly long time, I saw a movie which simply blew my mind away. 'Into the Wild' directed by Sean Penn is an outright classic with a staggering story and screenplay. Based on the book of the same title by Jon Krakauer, Sean Penn creates magic by bringing to screen the true story of Christopher Johnson McCandless, a footloose American itinerant who hiked to Alaska on a spiritual journey to find himself. Narrated in a non linear fashion, beginning with Chris in Alaska, the movie sways back and forth between his past and present recounting his life's story and adventures. Chris McCandless, an intelligent young man with rock strong ideals craves for true freedom, trying to break away from the bonds of the materialistic society. He gets a college degree, donates his money to charity and burns some of it later on, abandons all of his possessions, and embarks on an odyssey to Alaska to find happiness. On the way, he comes across people who shape his life as he proceeds to his destination.<br/><br/>The overwhelming fact is that it's a real life story of a man who went off searching for ultimate freedom. In Chris' words, ""The core of mans' spirit comes from new experiences"". 'Into the Wild' is an embodiment of the rebel in every one of us, who are all trying to emancipate from the bonds of the world in some way. The movie teaches us, in the words of Chris ""how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong, to measure yourself at least once, to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions, facing the blind death stone alone, with nothing to help you but your hands and your own head"". Chris' floccinaucinihilipilification of material possessions and wealth, his strong will to face the unknown in the picturesque yet dangerous wildnerness of Alaska serve as huge inspiration for everyone, teaching us along the way that it's important to do in life what gives you real happiness. ""If you want something in life, reach out and grab it"".<br/><br/>Stand out performances by the cast, great editing, brilliant music and prodigious cinematography that brings to life the breathtaking landscapes of Alaska make watching this movie an unforgettable experience."

","While it may perhaps have it's inaccuracies as some have pointed out, it is really no wonder to me why Into the Wild had picked up some wins and nominations. I found Into the Wild to be an absolutely beautiful movie in every way, in acting, writing and cinematography alike. They even managed to make a shot with a tarantula in the desert to be beautiful. <br/><br/>The characters that Christopher meets on his journey to his destination are also colourful and engaging. Perhaps my favourite of them was Ron, played by the terrific Hal Holbrook. My heart broke for him when he wanted to adopt Chris as his grandson, as being familiar with the story, that he would never come back to talk to him about it."

","First off, we all know everyone has different taste in movies. That being said, I can't honestly believe that anyone could ever consider this a bad movie. The first time i watched this i was completely trapped by the storytelling and the unique visual experience it gave me. The acting was outstanding... Hal Holbrook's performance was amazing.<br/><br/>I believe that the message of the movie was the most important element of all. This is real life, how everyone tries to get you to live by society's morale. I am certain that many people can identify with the main characters philosophy. This is about someone who has the guts to do what he REALLY wants. Needless to say, it moved me.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie screams talent and insight. I have read a lot of the reviews on IMDb about this movie, and i sincerely hope that no one takes the bad reviews seriously.

"extralargehead","9","0","1","9 April 2010"," A modern day masterpiece?
","With Into the Wild, Sean Penn; whom takes both screenwriter and director credit, sets about telling the story of estranged student, Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch). The film, based on the non fiction book of the same name by Jon Krakauer, follows Chris after his graduation as he goes about removing all materialistic elements of his life and also leaves his home and family behind. Chris renames himself 'Alexander Supertramp' and journeys, as the title so obviously suggests, into the wild.<br/><br/>We are told the story by McCandless' sister, played by Jena Malone (of Donnie Darko fame). This offers an outside insight into our ascetic travellers reasoning, ensuring that we can not resent him for his potentially reckless decision.<br/><br/>This film is a true journey, brought to life superbly by Hirsch's portrayal of McCandless as well as the various other supporting roles that open up a world full of intriguing characters with a lust for adventure and experience.<br/><br/>Of course, what coming of age film would be without a love interest? Into the Wild is no exception. However, as our 'Supertramp' befriends the undeniably appealing free spirited Tracy Tatro (or should I say Twighlight's 'Bella Swan'?) we realise that even love can't tear him away from his adventurous escape.<br/><br/>If nothing else grabs you about this film, the cinematography, courtesy of Eric Gautier, surely will. We are bombarded with landscape after landscape, from sun kissed beaches to snow frosted mountains, that are photographed in a way that have to be seen to be believed. You may argue that any one could make these places look amazing, in that case I'd challenge you to do the same.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a film filled with adventure, awe inspiring scenery and most of all; emotion. All backed up by an incredible soundtrack. Penn has done himself proud here and (if he wasn't already) he must be taken seriously as somebody that can work just as well behind the camera as in front. He cant take full credit though as the film is undoubtedly thrust higher by its characters, its story and of course one of the real stars, its scenery."

","I think this is a good film, I mean with nice takes, very good natural spectacles and good acting, however, I found the scenario hypocritic . I mean, this guy burns all his money and then works to earn some, he madly critisizes the consuming society, and still works in a burger king store, uses equipment which are all products of the industry that he hates and which destroys the wildlife he adores so much. He makes fun of laws, crosses borders and goes down the river forbidden, doesn't even have an ID, but he doesn't make love with the girl he likes just because she is not over 18. If he lives by nature's laws, then what is the point in that? I think this movie looks like trying to be a film about the guy who runs away from home and haves lots of fun, but in the end, gives the lesson ""hey boyz, don't run away from home, just listen to your parents or you will end up like him"""

I am not a good reviewer, which I am sure is obvious, however I had try and stop people making the same mistake as me. Passing on the movie because there is a big blockbuster out, or to rent/dig out a old favourite. Just watch and you will understand."

","I read the book quickly and with gusto in fact I've read it 3 or 4 times now. Yet when I heard there was to be a movie I was a bit skeptical. I was afraid that parts of Chris's life would be altered from the story or over all skipped. Yet when I saw the movie when it came out I was shocked in more way than one. Nothing seemed to be left out about Chris or the people he touched. The acting was amazing and I felt like the story was being told only to me. Also Eddie Vedders music was perfect. I heard the music he wrote for the movie and I instantly rushed to buy the CD afterward. Normally when I buy a DVD it will rot on the shelf for months before I watch it again. Yet Into The Wild is one that I take off the shelf often and watch. My copy of the book has gone on trips with me where ever I go. Every time I read the book or watch the movie I learn some new lesson or see something else in a new light. It has enlightened me."
"leah-xox-ess","10","0","2","9 October 2009"," Shocking, awe-inspiring and truly amazing: Into The Wild
","This is truly the most awe-inspiring film I have ever seen. Jon Krakauer's nonfiction novel of Christopher McCandless' life comes to the big screen with one big explosion.<br/><br/>The story begins with Emile Hirsch who plays an excellent portrayal of Chris McCandless, he is freshly graduated from College with a promising future ahead of him. Shortly afterwards though, he gives all of his life savings to charity, abandons his car, burns all identification of ""Christopher McCandless"" and sheds his real name early in his journey, adopting the moniker ""Alexander Supertramp"", and starts to hitch-hike across America, his ultimate goal being Alaska. He leaves his privileged life and goes ""into the wild"" in search of adventure. He lives life like the wind, moving constantly from town to town, hopping trains, camping with hippies (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), meeting a topless Dane and her boyfriend (Signe Eghom Olsen and Thure Lindhardt), an underage singer (Kristen Stewart), working briefly with a farmer (Vince Vaughn), and befriending a widowed leather worker (Hal Holbrook). Meanwhile at home, his parents and sister are unknown to the pure happiness he finds in freedom, instead they are riddled with worry and grief, and his sister Carine narrates a lot of the film, telling us of how Chris' decision to leave had an impact on their lives.<br/><br/>The film bounces back and forwards through time, showing the beginning days of his journey then shooting forwards towards the ending of his adventure and then back again.<br/><br/>What happened to him on the way transformed this young wanderer into an enduring symbol for countless people.<br/><br/>Hirsch as Christopher was an amazing decision. He gives off a light throughout the film of someone who wants to learn life's secrets, and he is ultimately kind, naive and selfish, as every human is. The complete understanding Emile Hirsch shows towards Chris McCandless makes the story truly believable and real. Christopher shows throughout the story an idea of being completely solitary and a loner, but at others he is very lively and the life of the party. The supporting cast is amazing too and I especially loved the interactions with Hirsch and Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart too. Similarly, William Hurt has a short moment towards the end of the film that is delivered without dialogue and is utterly heart-breaking.<br/><br/>Although many would argue that Chris McCandless was a cruel person, I do not think this is the case. He left his family in search for his big adventure, yes, but he did not intentionally hurt them. We all search for things in life, a thing most coveted is love, but Chris searched for freedom, and he found that in running with the stallions of the wild, he found that in surfing the white-water rapids, and he found that in nature, but he also learnt life's greatest adventure of all is not only in freedom, but in family and hope.<br/><br/>The film also makes full use of the spectacular American landscape, with stunning cinematography courtesy of Eric Gautier.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a thoroughly engaging, superbly directed film about a remarkable young man, with an Oscar-worthy performance from Emile Hirsch. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Sean Penn truly delivered with a fascination of McCandless that made itself known throughout the film.<br/><br/>People that see the film will feel inspired, others depressed, others angered by Chris' naivety and decisions but I promise you that whatever you feel, it will hit you with a torrent of emotion and depth.<br/><br/>My favourite film of all time, I recommend that everyone go out and watch it."

I've watched the film 15+ times and still glean a new nugget of wisdom on occasion. A real must see but have some Kleenex ready for the final 2 minutes.

Allow your body, your mind, the heart of a pure cathartic as satisfying emotion. Get carried by the sinuous and seductive charm of nature. Emile Hirsch aka Christopher McCandless, twenty-two of South Dakota and fresh out of college with a promising career before him that, in the early 90s, decided to donate all his savings to charity and leave for the north, in the wilderness, cutting all links with his family. The strength and explosive magic of this fourth film directed by Sean Penn is in its simple yet admirable portrayal of the imaginary nature. For Sean Penn nature is synonymous with grandeur, purity and untouchability. Not deceive them. Filming on the endless open spaces, lying on the snow-capped peaks, the wild animals, serve to further strengthen the concept: nature as a ""liberating goal"". In the journey of Christopher is glimpsed an escape from oppressive family prosaic and frustration, and a grueling research on the true meaning of life: ""Into The Wild"" is a poignant road movie, sincere and passionate and rebellious, full of unconventional seasoned by a bursting strong spiritual reminiscences of a secular spirituality. The entire film is permeated by a deep and touching humanity that characterizes all the characters with whom Christopher comes into contact. E 'on the basis of this fundamental aspect that focuses the attention of the director: the need for a dialogs between human beings. But not only. In ""Into The Wild"" is also reflected in a significant indictment of all 'American establishment, as ostentatious symbol of capitalism. Significant effects of the contrasting images of the virgin wilderness that efficiently Sean Penn amalgam with the irrepressible flow of a contemporary human megalopolis. Here is the disorientation of the protagonist in the face of this glaring dissonance becomes paroxysmal levels resulting from that famous and ominous message to the nation when Bush Senior announced, with calm, unperturbed, the entry of America in what was the first Gulf War. Followed by a rousing soundtrack and a beautiful picture, ""Into The Wild"" runs smoothly, raises questions, prompts consideration: the support of a close-knit cast over the amazing choral excel Emile Hirsch sees a beautiful Kristen Stewart , a nice and tender Catherine Keenaar, and above all, an outstanding Hal Holbrook in one of the most intense and moving roles that cinema has ever given us in recent years. And on the wings of wonderful aphorisms existential Christopher will face the adversities of fate, noting that the man, just as insignificant opposite the incommensurable, has its limitations in addressing a challenge so hard and rough. ""Happiness is only real if shared"": and that last look lifeless to the sky, perfectly framed by an extraordinary revival in the subject and the subsequent declaration of love of one who, aware of the danger, chose to love nature more than himself.

","I thought this was a beautifully made, thoughtful, well acted, photographed and directed film. Very moving and poetic to me. I could relate to and remember a period during my own youth when I felt very disaffected, detached, and contemptuous of ""society."" Fortunately, I never had the courage (and foolhardiness) to take such an extreme approach to that situation as the protagonist of this film did.<br/><br/>I find myself agreeing with both those who loved the movie and also those who hated it or are harshly critical of the way that Alex (aka Christopher) lived his last couple of years. And I think that is a testament to how good this movie is. It shows both sides of Alex's character. The good and the bad. Yes, it's terrible that he couldn't bring himself to contact his family and I don't think the movie suggests otherwise. On the other hand, this total break with his past (at least for a while) seemed to be something he needed to really feel free. I can kind of relate to that as well.<br/><br/>Too bad for him though that he was so foolish as to go into the wild with out the proper training, knowledge and equipment. If he hadn't made that fatal mistake, I think he would have crossed that river and returned to his family and society, greatly enriched by his experiences."

"jpschapira","8","0","1","27 July 2009"," Welcome to wherever you are...
","It's a fact that some images are so beautiful that justify the whole viewing of a film. That's what I thought of ""Into the wild"" the first time I saw it: I found it beautifully shot, owner of breathtaking images that tried to dissimulate its dramatic and ideological imperfections. I also thought of it as a film where ideology and drama where the same thing. Now, on a second viewing I've found a lot more, primarily because I was able to separate the dramatic part from the ideology. Ideologically, I still think it's pretty basic, but it's so dramatically powerful that it buries the ideals, or something like it. We worry about the fate of a character whose life choice (which involves living by himself in Alaska with the sole company of nature and nothing else as a final destination) has been defined by an ideal –a philosophy- and yet I find the places he goes to, the things he witnesses and the characters he encounters, more interesting than the words he speaks and the quotes he cites from a dozen books. <br/><br/>This is probably because there are hundred guys out there who want to do what Chris McCandless (a phenomenal Emile Hirsch) did, for the same reasons too; but it's his life that Sean Penn decided to show on screen, and his work as a director is so dedicated that we have to end up caring. Penn faithfully adapted Jon Krakauer's homonymous book and personally interviewed the McCandless family to give full life to a side that the book may have left untreated. Chris relationship with his parents was difficult, he had to live many lies for many years and he could only find comfort in his sister Carine. Jena Malone plays tenderly this role that has her more as a narrator than someone with a physical presence. But that's enough for the viewer to get and idea of who Chris really was, without the philosophy included, something Carine didn't understand completely. <br/><br/>And that's also enough for Penn. With Malone's voice, Eric Gautier's (""Diarios de Motocicleta"") photography, Eddie Vedder's powerfully sang songs and the accurate casting for the marvelous supporting characters; the director commences the journey. Shot entirely on location and without the use of risk doubles whatsoever, ""Into the wild"" emerges as a liberating road trip, and one that Sean Penn, eternal rebel, probably did (or would have done for that matter) when he was young. If the man was younger, I bet he would have also starred the film. <br/><br/>In part, this is why the movie also has a documentary feel, with honest moments of Hirsch almost improvising and looking at the camera that give a sense of intimacy; with conversations overheard, or observed from a distance, as if being closer meant prying. The sceneries, all beautiful and not only admirably shot but also shot with admiration, seem as something discovered for the first time; and some people who appear to describe them are surely from the whereabouts. <br/><br/>I don't really know if Chris actually learns anything in his journey, his ideals being so simple (something questioned by the people he meets) and him being so stubborn. He feels there's nothing new to be learnt, but what does occur to him is that he discovers. He discovers the places we experience with him, places of extreme materialism, places of extreme misery, and the balance; he discovers, with Jan (Catherine Keener, brilliant) and Rainey (Brian Dierker, very natural) that one person can have an enormous impact on others, even if it's for a few days; he discovers, with Tracy (marvelous Kristen Stewart, watch how she can't take her eyes off of him) that there's a room for romance even if we don't want it; and that one can be someone's last chance for happiness, as an old man (Hal Holbrook) expresses.<br/><br/>These things are all the same, and conversations in the film are few because this time images say more. The construction of the film works that way, and works well because it shows us its moment of total silence -the days Chris spent in Alaska living on a bus- combined with the rest of the story, so that it doesn't become tedious to watch it all at once (we've all seen ""Cast Away""). Remember that Sean Penn is an actor, and his film has the dramatic power to survive on images only; but he knows without words we wouldn't be able to feel the way every character feels about Chris, regardless any philosophy: we don't want him to go away."
"hylinski","8","0","1","11 July 2009"," Fascinating
","I watched this movie on Wednesday and it has been percolating through my mind ever since. It's not that it has awoken a desire to strike out for Alaska like the hero of the piece Christopher McCandless. Nor do I find his ethics or morality particularly palatable. It's just a good picture of an intelligent young person who does not share the capitalist dream, or the notion that relationships with others should be the basis of life.<br/><br/>Some critics have characterised him as cruel, because he distances himself so fully from his family, especially his sister. This is not a problem for me. My problem with him is that he doesn't fully perceive his dependence on society, even when he's out in the wild. Perhaps that's director Sean Penn's intention. I think I'll seek out the book sometime soon.<br/><br/>But these quibbles do nothing to demean a film which is well crafted and beautifully shot. It should be watched, and watched more than once."

","After reading Jon Krakauers's excellent book of the same title I initially intended to avoid this movie altogether. I was afraid it would get a cheesy Hollywood treatment and also I have strong distaste for Sean Penn's public shenanigans. What a tool! That said, when it came on Showtime in HD I had to check it out and was very pleasantly surprised. It's very respectfully and well done. I think if you have not read the book the movie would be a little confusing and certainly you are missing out on a lot of the back story.<br/><br/>But if you have read the book the movie adds some nice visual and narrative touches to this intriguing story which we can learn a lot from. Like many adventurers McCandless was searching for some sort of truth in the wilderness he thought could not be experienced in normal civilization. I thank Mr. Krakauer for documenting the young man's search and attempting to put it into context. He succeeded.<br/><br/>The movie also succeeds, but at a different level. It's more emotional which is a strength of the film medium and also more shallow which is a limitation of movies since they have less space to work with.<br/><br/>Overall, a fine treatment of the story, but this is one case where you should also read the book. It's easy to read and definitely worth your time."

All together this was a very good movie and I would recommend it to my friends like I said I didn't get to see all of it but the parts I saw I really liked. There were a couple of things I didn't like, like the way they Chris look when he was getting sick he looked just awful and I know he was supposed to but maybe not as bad as they made him look. I think people that desire adventure and freedom would really like watching this and learning from it. The quotes and the store were very down to earth and heartwarming to watch and hear. Even the clothes and settings were very nicely set and the clothes were right down to the time period. I won't say this was an amazing movie but it was very good and I liked how it was put together and I love how it was made from a real event.

"marcelbrooks","Null","0","1","21 January 2009"," A Wrenching Portrait
","Sean Penn's, Into the Wild is an alternately enthralling and wrenching portrait of a young man who ran from his problems and searched for peace and found paradise and, in turn, anguish and despair. Chris McCandless' journey is a gripping travelogue that's both a cautionary tale and a vicariously exhilarating experience; man, it looked like he had a whale of a good time, but man, did it end badly for him.<br/><br/>First and foremost, what makes Into the Wild work so flawlessly is that even knowing the final outcome doesn't change the overall effect that movie will have on the average moviegoer. Based on McCandless' real story, the movie pulls few punches in how the protagonist is depicted; he's neither a saint nor a sinner, just an idealistic (and not naive), troubled college graduate who feels adrift from literally everything: parents, life, friends.<br/><br/>Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a highly intelligent Emory College grad, the son of a NASA scientist (William Hurt) and an entrepreneur (Marcia Gay Harden). But unlike other privileged young citizens, Chris has no intentions of enjoying the gifts and wealth his family and connections have afforded him. Instead, he gives away his life savings of $24,000, abandons his beat-up Datsun, leaves his family behind (without telling them), and sets off on a trek around the country.<br/><br/>Chris's travels take him literally all over the country, across the midwest (where he runs a grain harvester for Vince Vaughn), to the Rocky Mountains, to the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, even down to Mexico, winding up at his ultimate resting spot: deepest, darkest, remotest Alaska. The story is told in two timelines, one of the present (the time shortly before and after Chris discovers an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness), and one of the past, the events leading up to Chris's Magic Bus time. And the two timelines are brilliantly juxtaposed with each other by director Sean Penn, who doesn't just show us a perfectly linear chronology of how Chris came to be in an abandoned bus; he shows us the story behind the adventurer, the believer, the angel, the tactiturn rebel, the iconoclast.<br/><br/>So what made Chris McCandeless decide to ditch everything and live off the land like some latter-day flower child? I'll explain no further than to say that his upbringing, under the commanding, demanding eyes of his overachieving, arguing parents, played a huge role - but perhaps not the only role. In short, Chris decides he simply does not wish to be part of the rat race; he does not wish to be trapped in a meaningless job working for a meaningless company doing trite, soul-destroying things. He wants to live and learn on his own. And that's where the inspirational aspect of this kicks in. He sets out to accomplish something undefined (i.e., the abstract Find Himself) and winds up absorbing more knowledge through his experiences than most people do through their lonely lives of quiet desperation.<br/><br/>Along the way, Chris meets myriad people, and it's genuinely touching how much of an impact he has on their lives as he passes through. In particular, Catherine Keener plays an aging hippie whose love for her soul mate (Brian Dierker) has begun to fade; the mere presence of the Christ-like Chris magically changes that, for the better. (A lesser film might have had Chris and Jan sleeping together to foment complications in everyone's relationship.) Chris tells everyone he meets that his ultimate goal is to live in the Alaskan wilderness, consequences be damned; everyone tells him not to do it.<br/><br/>The impression we're finally left with of Christopher McCandless is that of a clever, thoughtful, engaging young man who had more demons than a nightmare of Clive Barker dopplegangers. Haunted by his own harrowing childhood, he escaped as literally and figuratively as he could, living by the seat of his pants over thousands of miles of gravel, sand, and asphalt. His motives might have been a bit selfish (he never did try to contact his family, the film tells us), but his heart seemed to be in the right place otherwise. Which made his demise all the harder to bear.<br/><br/>Hal Holbrook, playing a crusty benefactor to Chris in the Arizona desert, earned an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but even stronger accolades are due to Hirsch, who underwent tremendous physical changes just to play Chris McCandless properly. And the final scene, the waning moments of Chris's life, is so vivid and packed with emotion that you almost can't bear to watch, peeking instead through crossed fingers. Hirsch is so excellent in the role that it's a travesty of some magnitude that he wasn't more widely recognized for his grueling, gutty performance.

","Back in middle school, I was assigned the novel this movie is based on and it truly touched me each time I read it. When I saw that the book will be made into a movie, I was delighted. Unfortunately, I had to wait over a year to watch the film. I ended up liking this film, not as much as I wanted to, but still enough.<br/><br/>The story is about Christopher McCandless. He is an unique person who believes that each individual should enjoy personal freedom. After he graduated college, he gave away his life savings and ditched his family to travel to Alaska. Along the way, he met some wonderful people and actually went to Mexico for a little bit. But how will Chris survive Alaska? The cast of this film is absolutely fantastic. Emile Hirsch, Jena Malone, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Catherine Keener, Kristen Stewart, Vince Vaughn, and Hal Holbrook each gave great, believable performances. I enjoyed the music as well since you hear Eddie Vedder songs throughout the movie. If you enjoy scenery, this movie is for you. The scenery is gorgeous and beautiful.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 because some of the movie seemed a little boring. I am not thrashing this film but I couldn't help keeping track of the time. I really enjoyed this film. I rate this movie 9/10."

","Hands up if you watched this film and identified yourself with high-flying college graduate Chris McCandless (brilliantly played by Emile Hirsch). Come on, be honest, surely you've day- dreamed about having enough of a free-spirited nature to see you give up all things materialistic and head for the great outdoors where you would survive all things thrown up at you - well, haven't you? Couldn't you see yourself doing what Chris McCandless does - forsake what promised to be a glittering future career in law, give away 24,000 dollars to charity, give up the pressures of modern day Western life and hit the highway heading for his Alaskan dream. Well I for one didn't identify myself with Chris. No. I identified with his dad. played magnificently by William Hurt (he's even better here than his role in Mr Brooks, if that's possible); a dad whose inability to show his son how much he loved him ( how many dads of his generation are guilty of this?) was one of the prime reasons that Chris hit the road in the first place. The scene where William Hurt goes out into the street, looks to the heavens and offers a tearful, silent prayer for the safety of his long- gone son is heart-wrenching; would that if he had his time again he would have shown his son how much he did indeed love him. On his travels Chris does find affection among the many like-minded free spirits who offer him shelter and, in some cases work, as he makes his way to his Alaskan dream. Chris finally makes it to the snow and ice-bound wilderness where his fight with nature is stunningly directed by Penn. The truly saddening aspect of this film as it draws to an end is that it shows a man who lives his dream but comes to realise that the best things in life may be free but they are nothing if they are not shared - a lesson learnt too late by his distraught father. A memorable film."

","INTO THE WILD is a terribly sad and emotionally gripping cinematic journey, incredibly based on a true story, about a young man named Christopher Johnson McCandless. who after graduating from college, decides to forsake his cushy upper middle class lifestyle, change his name to Alexander Supertramp, and journey across country,with nothing but the clothes on his back, with his eventual goal being to travel to the Alaskan wilderness. Sean Penn's meticulous direction and eloquent screenplay take us on a cinematic journey quite unlike anything we've seen before. This is not an easy watch...there are several moments in this film depicting what Chris has to do to survive in the wilderness that completely redefine the phrase ""roughing it"" and definitely make this a film not for all tastes. but if you can stomach it, the journey is worth it and will leave a lump in the throat. Emile Hirsch is impressive in the physically and emotionally demanding role of Chris, probably the strongest performance of his career. Oscar winners William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden appear as Chris' parents and Vince Vaughn, Catherine Keener, and in a performance that earned him his first Oscar nomination, Hal Holbrook, also score in brief supporting roles. The film is also beautifully photographed with some breathtaking scenery but it is the work of Penn and Hirsch that make this deliberate journey worth your time."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","1 January 2009"," Sean Penn takes us ""Into the Wild""
","""Into the Wild"" concerns recent university graduate Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) and the path he treads when he goes out 'into the wild' to escape the grasp of his parents and their world. The film is based on a true story, which is something that I didn't realize until the end of the film.<br/><br/>The film-makers did a fine job of assembling a worthy cast. Hal Holbrook nabbed the film's only Oscar nomination for acting and it's hard to argue with that distinction. The rest of the supporting cast is solid and Emile Hirsch does a fine job in the lead role.<br/><br/>Sean Penn's directorial choices were thoughtful though I could have done without some of the narration and overly indulgent visuals. The editing garnered the film its second of two Oscar nominations but I didn't see it as a strong suit. The film should have gotten some Oscar notice for the Eddie Vedder score as well, but it was ruled ineligible on the grounds that it was too 'song-based'.<br/><br/>As for the story, it slowly draws you in and allows you to get to know Christopher McCandless - both his virtues and his faults. The two and a half hour running time might have benefited from a little trimming but this is not the sort of film that will engage those with short attention spans anyways.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film proves to be a worthwhile drama that is composed of equal parts road film and character study. If that sounds appealing to you, by all means check it out."

","I have read numerous reviews, some good and some bad on this movie and I thought I could be of some help to people that want to get a sense of what this movie is about.<br/><br/>""Into the Wild"" is about a young man that thinks he knows what he wants out of life. He is selfish, crazy and brilliant all in one. He is someone that attracts people without even trying. His take on life is that the best things are free, nature, natural beauty is the only thing he needs to be happy. It is a tragic story of someone that needed to wander into the wilderness to figure out what true happiness is.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is amazing; all of which bring something special into the movie and Emile Hirsch is great. His acting is brilliant taking into account that most of the time he is not talking but rather using body language to get points across.<br/><br/>This movie is not a sermon against ""the man"" and is not a movie about a hero. It is a movie about a young man that experienced more in two years than most do in their lifetimes and thus at the end of his life realizes that the people he has met and left behind is what creates true happiness.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 9 / 10 stars because i absolutely loved the film, the music was soothing and beautiful and the scenery was amazing. It made me rethink the things that i am doing in my life and made me realize all the beauty that is still left to discover.

","What a wonderful film. And what a sad story. I understand Christopher's eagerness to experience a different kind of lifestyle and somehow try to get away of all the problems he had back at home. But that would've been good if it had been for a while, in order to find himself. What I found amazing is all the different people he met along his journey and how he touched and left a part of him in each one of them. However, the only thing that bothers me is that he was a little selfish, because, as much as he wanted to reach his destination and make his dream come true, all the people that were left behind suffered from his absence and thinking what was it like for him being out there, with nothing but will, courage and a dream. It's sad how a situation like this makes a person react. Christopher's parents knew they had done something wrong and it was to late to make it right. Emile Hirsch's performance is extraordinary. The rest of the cast is very good. I was very surprised to see a grown-up Kristen Stewart, performing a song with a very nice voice. Sean Penn did it again, now from the director's chair.

"kellyadmirer","10","0","2","24 December 2008"," The Fantasy of Just Giving it all Up....
","This is an excellent film, full of natural beauty and wonderful characterizations. But most of all, it is a film with a dual nature, at once extolling the idea of just walking away from your life and giving it all up, while showing the cost of doing so. Cost, not in monetary terms, because that is not the currency in which this film trades. But cost in terms of human sacrifice and the effect it has on others. In a way, this film is an affirmation of the effect we have on others, and how we touch them in ways large and small.<br/><br/>So young Mr. McCandless, a brilliant and educated student, one day decides to abandon his bright future in some big office building and instead decides to experience the world at its most basic level. His decision might have had something to do with the sustained repression it takes to succeed as he did in school. After spending your entire life depriving yourself to succeed at school, with no break, the urge to break free and do something - anything - different can become overpowering. And haven't we all had that fantasy, to just drop everything and hit the road? Well, maybe not everyone, but I think a lot of people do. And this is an only slightly fictionalized tale of his doing that.<br/><br/>I think the film is a fair portrait, at least of the main character. It is full of the kind of incidents that a traveler might experience. The people he meets ring true - there really are nice people out there, who live at various levels of freedom from the usual rules of society. The do look for people like themselves to spend time with. There are hippies spending their lives driving from nowhere to nowhere, grizzled old veterans licking ancient wounds, prosperous outlaws who rebel in their own way. We who have submitted to ""normal life"" don't see them, except in passing, such as the office worker who gives McCandless the time while passing him on the street. But they are there.<br/><br/>The film shows that there are different kinds of rebellion, different gradations of submission to the social order. ""Alex Supertramp,"" as he takes to calling himself, chooses his own level, which is not sustainable in the long run but certainly enables him to experience raw survival. Which he was deprived of in his comfortable suburban former life.<br/><br/>It is easy to find fault with the choices that ""Alex"" makes. He could have just taken the Summer off, or a year. For instance, it's common in Australia/New Zealand for students to do that, to take a couple of years after school and just roam through Europe with backpacks. He certainly is naive about a lot of things. But to have the courage to do what he did, give everything up just to live free, is inspiring. Well, it inspired me, anyway. Not to give everything up like he did, but to appreciate that we do all have choices about how we want to live, and we make them every day.<br/><br/>I understand where he was coming from. He did see things others won't. His flame burned bright, just short. A few different choices, a little more submission, and he could have pulled his adventure off indefinitely. But the fact that he didn't submit even in small ways (wearing socks at menial jobs, for instance), and that he didn't even try, shows that he really was engaged in a sort of prolonged suicide, defiance of modern life and of what others wanted. This film brought to mind Kirk Douglas' classic ""Lonely are the Brave."" There are hints that ""Alex"" was simply too sensitive for this world, with rather prosaic scenes of family strife from his childhood that he apparently never got over.<br/><br/>""Alex"" had issues. All of his quotations from famous writers can't hide that. He dealt with his issues by running away, by returning to nature and going primitive. Not the best way to cope, for sure. But he sure lived out the fantasy. And who is to say that living a fantasy for a short time is worse than living a long conventional life? Well, each of us. But his answer just happened to be different than almost everyone else's.<br/><br/>I liked Hal Holbrook's character, and many others in the film - seeing an 82-year-old man run and climb mountains is special. The interaction between people of different generations on something of an equal level was wonderful. Vince Vaughn was a standout - his character's advice to ""Alex"" at the moment of their parting shows that his character, too, cherished the fantasy. And he might have traded places at that moment - but probably not. He, too, had made his choices, and his weren't Alex's.<br/><br/>Enjoy the fantasy. Watch the film. Then go back to your house or apartment, wake up tomorrow and take a shower, eat breakfast and go to work or school. And maybe appreciate once in a while that it is possible to break out of that mold, if only we, too, want to give up all our possessions and mental/emotional baggage and pay the price."

","After finally getting around to reading the book I couldn't wait to see the movie and did so within a couple of hours.<br/><br/>So with the astonishing book very fresh in my memory I was somewhat apprehensive about how I could enjoy the movie --if at all.<br/><br/>And I am not one of those whiners who always complain that the book is never as good as the movie. That is BS because a lot of times the movie makers get it right (think The Dead Zone & Jaws & Clockwork Orange, All The President's Men & Eight Men Out + others). And when they get it wrong the stench can almost strangle you (think The Choirboys & Semi-Tough).<br/><br/>That's another topic for another day.<br/><br/>This is a deeply felt, beautifully rendered & thought-provoking movie. Emile Hirsch nails the enigmatic Chris McCandless who is, of course, the privileged son who leaves it ""all"" behind to find himself in the Alaskan wilds. It is a tough role because the way his McCandless is described in the book there isn't a wide range of emotions he outwardly expresses. There is almost a blankness to him that could have vaporized into thin air, BUT it doesn't and that allows you to ponder & perhaps project your own thoughts onto his inner journey outwardly bound. The other performances are top-notch. However HaL Holbrook's work here should have got him the Oscar.<br/><br/>Whatever you think of Sean Penn's politics should have absolutely no bearing on your thoughts about his handling of this material. He hits all the right notes as a director. Who does he think he is? Clint Eastwood?<br/><br/>This film moves along covering a surprising amount of ground and yet I never felt short-changed. Like the book, this film is potent & introspective stuff. Both will touch your mind & your heart<br/><br/>Read the book before or after the movie.<br/><br/>Note to Mr. Penn: you know that there is another Krakauer book begging for proper big-screen treatment and it may take you even higher in the directors' ranks.<br/><br/>(And I thought The Bourne Ultimatum, American Gangster, Michael Clayton, Eastern Promises & Knocked Up were the 5 best films of '07.)"

","Give this film a chance and be patient...<br/><br/>When I first zapped through this film a bit to see what it was like, I had the feeling I would not like it, could not identify with it's characters and it was portraying the main character, the adventurous, reckless Chris, as ""good"" (basically telling me, who is just watching a film sitting on my chair, is ""bad"" because I am so unlike him).<br/><br/>Fortunately, the film does not judge, which is why it's so powerful. There are a lot of emotions from people and a lot of questions asked, but there is no winner or loser, no one is right or wrong, no definitive answer. Of course people do not need movies to think but this one poses questions that few would ask themselves ever. We take a lot of things for granted when it comes down to choosing a path in life. Study, career, family, they seem rather unavoidable.<br/><br/>Chris chooses to get away from all this and finds true freedom, with a price. He is no hero, but by god, does he have the courage to let go of the life as it was mapped out for him! A lot of us don't.<br/><br/>I don't think the film is beautiful because of the scenery, it's the acting, the emotional richness and the very relevant philosophical questions it poses. I am not going to change my whole life because of it, but am more aware of the traps it can have if I stick too much to the familiar path."
"shannon-weiss","10","0","2","14 December 2008"," A Rare Beauty and Must-See!!
","Into the Wild is a beautiful film that takes the time to relish in the simple pleasures that most people neglect to even consider. The grandeur of nature, the deep meaning behind a simple act of kindness, and the innate desire of man to commune with a force greater than himself. The slow, natural pace of the film illustrates the timelessness of life in the wild and one's ability to savor every waking second. Into The Wild also conveys the importance of human relationships, illustrating that time spent alone can reaffirm a person's life but is not a fulfilling life in and of itself. Told through secondhand accounts in a style that reads as a documentary film, Krakauer's book version of Chris McCandless' life lacks the degree of emotional relevance that is present in the film. The film stays with McCandless through all of his experiences, therefore providing the poignancy that one might expect from the written biography. While the book impelled many readers to believe that McCandless was a wandering suicidal idealist with no desire for human contact, the film is able to drive home that point that McCandless was frustrated with the capitalistic scheme that engulfed him and that he was simply looking for himself in the wild. It is evident that the human experiences McCandless had while traveling to Alaska affected him greatly and that he intended to maintain contact with each of his newfound friends. McCandless did in fact work along the way in order to support his new lifestyle but simply denounced a life of excess. The landscape is breathtaking, the relationships touching and the story of a young man in search of a meaningful existence is admirable and tragic. It is hoped that those interested in seeing the film will not be dissuaded by those who say it is too long, too slow and too boring as such opinions counter the essence of McCandless' mission. The film is well crafted, well acted, and penetratingly beautiful."

","A very well done movie that explores the short life of a rather disturbed young man who cuts all ties to society and becomes a vagabond and eventually journeys to Alaska where he is overwhelmed by the harsh terrain and starves to death in the wilderness.<br/><br/>The movie - to some extent - allows one to make up ones on mind about his motivations. The contacts he has with the people on his journey are very well portrayed. Perhaps there is some romanticism here and there - are all homeless people so friendly and there seems to be very little rainfall in this movie. Being alone on a highway with a back-pack can look fun when the sun is shining and the scenery beautiful.<br/><br/>Also there is a tendency to blame parents for problems. When you become twenty it is time to stop blaming your parents for all your problems. His parents did not force him to leave home in that style - as a matter of fact he was lined up to leave home and go to Harvard - so why this strong pull to renounce ALL worldly goods? But the beauty of this movie is its very strong emotional pitch."
"fred-houpt","8","0","1","6 December 2008"," Very fine movie, disturbing theme
","I have not read the book so this is the first impression of the story through the movie. I recognize in Penn a director who continues to mature, grown and learn his craft. I don't want to focus on the beauty of the wilderness or deserts or ocean fronts. That is a distraction for me. What haunts me and what others have commented on is whether the risks that Chris takes is worth the journey. Clearly he is torn inside and has internalized much of his family angst. He is the unexpected black sheep and at the most unusual moment, just after graduating High School he bolts from his family without ever contacting them again. Period. As others have pointed out, if he had it in mind to punish his parents because he rejected the lies that they lived life by then how to explain his (ignoring) his dear sister who loved, adored and clung to him for strength and support? Clearly Chris was above average in intelligence but it seems to me that he was unwilling to leave his adolescent and somewhat romantic boyhood behind and enter manhood with a full and vigorous grappling. Instead he runs away to find something in himself. Why is he drawn to Alaska of all places? What is, after all, Alaska: the most remote continental State, farthest he can remove himself from his parents, the most totally wild and untamed place and what he discovers only at the end, also one that can be the most dangerous place to ""go it alone"" in.<br/><br/>We do not get a sense that Chris understands what drives him, what his obsessions for obliterating his past are. He cannot live with his real name, he adopts a false persona. How odd. He cannot face his parents or his sister and include them in his withdrawal. To me that smacked of selfish and childish thoughtlessness. But, just as clearly he is drawn inwards to find a truth that he can live with. At the very end he finds it but by then the cold, impersonal, heartlessness of ""nature"" has closed off more than his escape. He is doomed to die with his insight. Knowing at the very end that just being happy by himself is not enough and that this happiness, this peace with ones self has to be shared in order for it to have meaning took him so very long to learn; what is so sad is that he paid no attention to that lesson all those long months he ran from his family. He kept getting the same lesson presented to him over and over again. <br/><br/>Those he kept company with acted with the intention of sharing and loving each other. All he had to do was slow down just enough to appreciate what they were mirroring and showing him. Had he done that he could have achieved that satori much earlier and not foolishly placed himself in such a ridiculous hazard so as to fall so deeply. His naive and displaced trust into the beauty of nature, of the goodness in nature, did not protect him from his own folly.<br/><br/>I should read the book I suppose. The film is quite sad when you see how unnecessary the risk taking, how obvious the insights were. But, some of us are inflamed with such a burning need to run, to flee what is painful, to judge others as having failed us. Had he returned with those insights...that is what we are left wondering at the end.<br/><br/>Powerful performances are what we expect and in Chris, Rainey, Jan and Ron we have solid characters that hold the film together. It is a moving and powerful film but ultimately so sad."

","In sharing the experience of this movie... Walk the muddy path with the Rainbow children and break bread with those discarded among the cement alleyways to know, firsthand, the genuine message of this work of art. Even a prodigal son is not deaf to the call from deep within that is the voice of a truly free man. Do we not often find that to answer such in honesty is to brandish the soul with caution forgotten - to risk life and comfort for something greater? Hirsch carries us so believably from prosperity to desperation as his own character seems to blend perfectly with the transition from the coddled false society he could not reconcile to 'happiness is real only when shared,' as he yields to the fate of classic Greek tragedy. <br/><br/>The themes of Lords of Dogtown (Hirsch), My Own Private Idaho (R. Phoenix, K. Reeves) and 'Where the Day Takes You' precede Penn's work, fleshing out the antagonism of wealth and poverty entangled in the question of 'what does it really mean to be alive?' Into the Wild stands as a suitable sequel, but is very much its own message with the battle within the same person, made even more compelling in its basis on the true story. <br/><br/>Like Oliver Stone's 'Alexander,' a true Greek tragedy of a man's dreams exceeding the limits of his body and of the ones he loves, the timeline is not sequential, bonding Chris' otherwise obtuse choices to their emotional authors. Penn might have beneficially added more struggle by Alexander Supertramp, particularly in light of Hirsch's strong stage presence and natural confidence, in resisting the temptations of settling into relationships. In this way he might avoid the character seeming too overdriven in his journey to Alaska. But possibly this question is well enough compensated for in the irony and intensity of the conclusion. The credibility of the character is remarkably enhanced by what must have been a very difficult loss of weight by Hirsch, who surely gave himself to the part in heart and soul, and convincingly unfolded Chris' revelation.<br/><br/>Could we not perhaps consider some room for comic relief? We might relate to 'Jeremiah Johnson' (R. Redford), another man's searching for the true mettle of his soul in the wilderness, not without its humorous moments. But the scene in which Supertramp is told that he has to wait twelve years to paddle a canoe down the Colorado River does elicit one of Hirsch's lovable sarcastic smirks that is rivaled only by Harrison Ford's half-smile when he jerks the steering wheel and bumps off the German soldier on the motorcycle (Raiders of the Lost Arc). Humor is subtle, but it is arguable that any quantity of it would derail the mood and point.<br/><br/>From the sheepskin of a society lost in it's love of material success, Supertramp, the 'leathertramp,' documents his search for truth upon a cowhide belt, showing the real testimony of his struggle in the unrefined cuts he must make in it to wear it on his withering body. But so much of the story is felt more than seen, in the lyric and voice of a perfectly matched musical author. Eddie Vedder's work of art as well, impossible to imagine the film without, allows the ear to transform tragedy into introspection, bonding this story of a real person with a world we can hope for, in which happiness can linger among us for a while, free from the paradox of Hamlet's manhood."

","One of the better movies of 2007. If you're a fan of the book ""Into the Wild"" then you'll be impressed with this production which doesn't take any liberties with the story.<br/><br/>The acting is good and consistent here. The only downside I can see is the occasional poor direction by Sean Penn. Sometimes his ""poetic"" style is a bit much and a bit forced. We can make some connections on our own without the help of the director.<br/><br/>That being said the scenery is beautiful. The acting is great, especially by Emile Hersch but at times I felt like certain aspects of the story could be cut out to focus more on certain points of Chris' life."
"avianblue","9","0","1","20 October 2008"," Wonderful - but ultimately the story of a misguided fool
","As a film it's hard to fault Into the Wild. It's a fantastic piece of film-making - brilliantly directed and with a stand-out performance by Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless. With a superb narrative drive and accompanied by the wonderfully melancholic acoustic music of Eddie Vedder it's at times both moving and incredibly uplifting.<br/><br/>However, the film's weak point is the fact that it's based on a true story - and a real person - with the resultant constraint imposed on the ending. Because no matter how much Jon Krakauer or Sean Penn might try to romanticise the character of McCandless, they can't change the fact that he stupidly killed himself for no reason.<br/><br/>It's also hard to hide the fact that McCandless wasn't that nice a person. How much of his real character comes out in the film is open to question - but Hirsch's portrayal, when one analyses it, is really one of a spoilt, selfish, egotistical fantasist who shunned his parents simply because they argued a lot and because he was born out of wedlock.<br/><br/>At any one time there are probably thousands of white, middle-class young adults from western countries like McCandless who, having realised that the world isn't such a nice place after all, rail against society and pursue some form of idealistic path in life. Unlike most (who succumb to the realisation that some element of conformance is necessary to actually live in the real world) McCandless gained notoriety because his inexperience, naivety and arrogance ultimately resulted in his needless death. He ended up trapped in the Alaskan wilderness by a river which had risen since he had first crossed it. But had he simply taken a proper map with him he would have known that a crossing existed a mere quarter-mile away from where he originally waded across! Somewhat arrogantly, he thought he knew all he needed to know and paid for it with his life. <br/><br/>So in the end it's hard to sympathise with Hirsch's character. Which is a shame because had the ending been more uplifting - even if McCandless had somehow died for a worthy idealistic cause - this would be a truly life-changing film."

It made me open all my senses into it by an excellent work in the visual part, colors, music; the lines that were told, reflections about life that are very simple and enjoyable, but one is often blind to assume them.<br/><br/>Aproaching to the end of the movie one can build figure a typical end of a journey (end of the film), and the movie could be finished like any ""journey about"" film, but the fact is that the way the resources were used (art and the way the events developed) grants a perfect end of the story, marking the difference with this piece above others.<br/><br/>Nothing more to say, great movie.<br/><br/>I loved the narrative connection between the sister and the protagonist."

","Into the wild is a great movie (flat out!). It might look like a documentary for the 1st few minutes but as soon as the stages (birth etc.) start coming up, you feel like OK, it's not going to be a NGC documentary but a movie about human psychology, of how one's childhood can determine the direction of the rest of the life. The stages in journey show different aspects of human beings, they all have different personalities, some have a story and some don't. The movie however could have been shorter by 10 minutes by shortening some of the adventure scenes sprinkled throughout the movie. The film has been shot beautifully, the cinematography is break from the regular movies and the background music also goes well with every shot. I really loved the way the fruit of the movie was put into one sentence towards the end 'Happiness is for real when it is shared', which is a great lesson to be learned from this guy's story that the theory that going far from everybody will bring happiness doesn't hold water. Another lesson was nature, music, books, a nice mate and kids together make a meaningful life, get it???"

","Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) was not a glamorous, iconic movie star; nor was he a billionaire and philanthropist or a politician who made a lasting difference. Rather, he was a young man whose achievements went far beyond his 24 years on Earth. Headstrong and determined, McCandless reached for his goal of embarking on a journey through the Alaskan wilderness, and from beyond the grave he continues to inspire young people to take up the challenge of getting back to basics and living off nature.<br/><br/>In a performance that is sure to establish him as being in the highest ranks of actors of his generation, Emile Hirsch masterfully harnesses Chris' tenacity, his inner disaffection and finally, his eventual vulnerability and anger at the world in a role I found myself relating to almost a little too much. Backing him up, Hal Holbrook and especially Catherine Keener provide backbones respectively to Ron Franz, the old man who becomes a voice of reason for Chris, and Jan Burres, a ""rubbertramp"" (wanderers who travel with vehicles), who shares Chris' platonic and spiritual love affair with nature.<br/><br/>However, it is ultimately writer-director Sean Penn's movie  and Into the Wild is indeed proof that Penn is every bit as gifted as a screenwriter and director as he is as an actor. His adaptation of Jon Krakauer's 1996 novel of the same name gets to the very core of the heart and mind of a confident but very inwardly scarred young man and thanks to some terrific editing and gorgeous outdoor cinematography, Penn succeeds in showing the wilderness in both its forms and powers: a treacherous entity that is harsh and unforgiving, but also as something very tranquil and heavenly that can map the human soul and show its limitations. Into the Wild is by turns powerfully moving in its dark humanism, and life-affirming in its depiction of a young man who reached for his ambitions and found peace within himself despite meeting such a tragic and premature demise. The best film of 2007. RIP Christopher McCandless 1968  1992."

"matthewpr06","9","0","1","3 August 2008"," My Opinion on Into The Wild
","Into the Wild is a film about the last few years of Christopher McCandless's life; which was spent wandering aimlessly around the North American wilderness meeting all kinds of free thinking and free loving, tax dodging vagrants. Christopher, or Alex, as he is better known in the film, was from a privileged background. He ignobly decided to reject materialism and fall off the grid. Alex is an unsympathetic character, and throughout the film I struggled to muster not only sympathy, but also a semblance of comprehension as to why Alex took the path that he did, in such a brutally selfish manner. In a lesser film, this fact alone could ruin what follows entirely, but Emile Hirsch gives and incredibly tuned in and dedicated performance as Chris/Alex. The high level of this central performance helps to turn a dislikeable real life person into a complicated and interesting character whose stunning journey exceeds the limitations of his rather naïve, dubious, hurtful and silly motivations.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is the heart of this film and it excels because of his performance. There are, of course, other elements in the film which are exemplary, the supporting characters (for the most part) have limited screen time, but are all well written and form an important piece of Alex's puzzle. Particularly memorable are the quirky Danish couple that Alex encounters while canoeing his way to old Mexico. The soundtrack is brilliant and evocative and the cinematography is equally triumphant, dude. An early third act wobble with a tacked on romance and a regurgitation of already expended hippie characters is quickly remedied by a tremendously uplifting and moving encounter with an elderly loner (Hal Halbrook). His wisdom is inspirational to Alex; whose eagerness and vitality, in turn, rejuvenates the ageing recluse. It's a beautiful segment that provides the luxurious and creamy topping on an already tasty chocolate cake.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a slow paced and well assembled film. Just as the film lingers, so do the questions that it raises. There is inspiration to be found here, a moving and unusual fiction that is more effecting and noble than the reality on which it is based. I personally rate Into the Wild as the second best film of 2007, sandwiched neatly in between Jesse James and Ian Curtis."

Meeting people, get experiences and something like that. In the end, returning home and hugging the whole family. I was wrong.<br/><br/>After I had left the cinema I was real dizzied. I've never seen such a good movie in my whole life. After an hour in the film I began to nervously wait for the big suspense. My waiting was finished. I even compared the film with holidays after an hour because of its great landscape pictures. But no, I was wrong again.<br/><br/>Chris has ever dreamed of getting into the wild. Out of all problems, careers, money and his parents. His sister always supported him. Also as he was miles away. She never really knew where he was and what he did, but she knew him. And she could conceive what he was going to do.<br/><br/>His sister's voice and the great music is a huge part of the film. The voice fits perfectly into it  in the German version. She describes her feelings to his brother very philosophically. Every phrase of her is full of truth, sadness but also gratefulness.<br/><br/>Later I was fascinated of the environment, of 'Alex' and his stories on the way to Alaska. 148 minutes  and none of it was boring or worthless. The film captures you. You stare to the screen and feels with Chris in every second. I was impressed.<br/><br/>Sean Penn created a masterpiece. It's another proof that actors also can be great directors  like Ben Affleck in 'Gone Baby Gone'. Emile Hirsch as Chris did an absolutely great job. He didn't need a stuntman or a double. He was hundred percent Christopher McCandless. It was fun to see him. As I was out of the theater I recognized: Now I need holidays!<br/><br/>This film required a lot.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","1","18 July 2008"," An Oscar snub and an inspiring American film
","""Into the Wild"" is one of the best films I have ever seen that is 95% without addressing any kind of human sin or vice. Almost no one wrongs anyone or indulges in anything of moral consequence: this is a film about man vs. self and of course man vs. nature. It is a coming- of-age story and then some; it is an adventure that explores the American countryside as well as the human soul. Sean Penn has rarely written or taken the director's chair in his career and it's clear to see why he took a seat with this project: it's a truly inspiring film.<br/><br/>""Into the Wild"" is based on a Jon Krakauer book that catalogues the true story of Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch), who after graduating Emory decides to rid himself of his family and all of his worldly possessions, call himself Alexander Supertramp, and travel the country with hopes of living out in Alaska. The film takes a narrative and literary structure that redefines the phrase ""adapted from a novel."" There are actual chapters and the scenes really do feel like chapters the way they are split by very verbose narrative from Chris' sister Carine (Jena Malone). It's a terrific style that Penn has created and rather essential for understanding the film's ideas.<br/><br/>McCandless' story is an empowering one: It would seem hard to screw up. The trick, however, is keeping it interesting (especially at almost 2.5 hours long). The way that Penn has it jump from McCandless when he finally is in Alaska to the story of how he gets there helps that along. Penn also uses some really cool techniques and though-provoking shots that carry deeper meaning in addition to being stylistically pleasing. While ""Wild"" does drag at times, the great ensemble cast helps it change pace. The only regret I have with the film is that despite how long it is, the supporting characters don't get enough time to develop. That and the overall tempo are the only things keeping this from a 10/10 in my eyes.<br/><br/>Hirsch does a very good job of capturing the free spirit of McCandless and getting across the values and reasoning for why he did what he did. It's more so Penn's script that slowly kind of reveals this logic, but Hirsch will definitely have a terrific career doing dramas, no question. Supporting actors Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook are also very good (Holbrook's last scene is one of the more touching moments in the film) though it would have been nicer to have seen more of them. <br/><br/>Though that's sort of the point of the film in a way. McCandless abandons everything for the sake of living free and dissolving himself of the fabrications of society (particularly money). He is completely driven in this regard that it makes him ignorant of the way he touched the lives of those he met and most importantly, how they truly meant something to him.<br/><br/>This is a film that will make you take a long hard look at the way you live and will likely unearth a deeper appreciation of life's simplest gifts that get lost in the hustle and bustle of society and its fascination with material possession. The only person who wouldn't get that from this film is one who has a profound hate for Emerson and Thoreau. This is just a great movie and best of all, it is one that is incredibly positive: now that's a Hollywood rarity."

The story of this mans adventure is both moving and inspiring.<br/><br/>I really couldn't fault the acting by Emile Hirsch as Chris McCandless. It could be a classic case of an actor thats acting as himself, and doing it well, but he is very likable and very believable in the leading role; which is the main reason why the film works and why you keep watching. The supporting cast are strong in their roles with William Hurt and Maria Gay Harden who play the parents effectively and Jena Malone as McCandless' sister (and part narrator of the film) also executes her part well. However Hirsch is the films soul focus and when the story goes to the supporting cast you find yourself wanting to go back to the main character's journey again.<br/><br/>Sean Penn must have fallen in love with this true story of a mans adventure ""Into the Wild"", because some of the shots in this film are jaw dropping and the direction throughout is exquisite. The fact that he also wrote the screenplay and produced it just impresses further. There are very profound statements throughout the film and speeches from the young and old which are highly thought provoking and some which viewers will relate to.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a movie that some may have to persevere with as it takes a while for the story to come together and for the message of the film to come to light.

","THE PLOT: True story about a young man named Christopher McCandless who graduates from college and then decides he has no interest in falling into society's trappings. After giving his life savings to charity and then, literally, burning the rest he drives west where he lives off the land and meets a lot of really cool people. Eventually he makes it to Alaska where he feeds off of wild berries and lives out of an abandoned bus.<br/><br/>THE POSITIVE: The film is incredibly fluid and engrossing. Despite its length it never becomes tedious and remains completely compelling throughout. It does a very good job of getting you to appreciate and understand McCandles who otherwise may seem extremely eccentric and weird. You really get inside his head and feel for him especially in the very moving finale. The people he meets along the way are very cool and engaging. It is nice that the film captures a hippie subculture that exists today and not just portrayed as a movement from a bygone era. Vince Vaughan is very good in a role that is a little unusual for him. It would have been even better had they fleshed his character out a little bit more. Hal Holbrook is nothing short of phenomenal. This role makes for a perfect book end to his great career. Watching him climb up the side of a very steep hill at his advanced his age is inspiring. If there was ever a performance screaming for a Oscar it is this one and it is a crime that he didn't get it. It is also nice that the film was shot on location at all the different spots where McCandless went as well as seeing a picture of the real McCandless at the very end.<br/><br/>THE NEGATIVE: Jena Malone as the film's narrator doesn't work. She has a voice that sounds like someone that just got out of high school and yet she ends up postulating on some very profound and philosophical thoughts that just doesn't seem convincing. It is good to see Hurt still working, but his small part as the perplexed father is pretty thankless. The scene where he flies into a rage at his wife seems more laughable than dramatic.<br/><br/>THE LOWDOWN: This is a film that will make you feel good and excited about life and the people in it. It gets high marks in every conceivable category.<br/><br/>THE RATING: 9 out of 10."

And Sean Penn's movie depicts this brilliantly with an extraordinary performance by Emile Hirsh, who immerses himself in the character in a way that is not so common.<br/><br/>The landscapes are absolutely amazing and the fact that the film was shoot on location makes the viewer even closer to the character and to what is happening to. You can't help but feel you're part of his journey, that you're there feeling what he feels, having the same experiences he is having, growing up like him.<br/><br/>With the ending, one of the most haunting and unfair, although real, I've seen in a long time, comes the realization that there are many beautiful things in life but they're only worth it if shared. But for McCandless it was too late..."

","Many consider Into the wild as philosophical but in reality its better to see this movie as a biography of a unconventional lad named Chris Mccandless.Even though some of the thoughts given in the movie is good and the characterization is wonderful,two and a half hours is bit too much to bear for a slow paced movie.Certainly at least half an hour portion should have been edited. <br/><br/>Nevertheless this is a good movie with lots of moments and certainly an different attempt but since this movie was slow moving and boring at times.<br/><br/>I give : 6/10"
"raypdaley182","6","0","5","25 April 2008"," Incredible story
","I don't want to rate this too highly.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's a very good movie. But the motives of the main character are highly questionable.<br/><br/>He's a guy who just graduated college and gives up everything he has to go travelling around America. That might not sound like a big deal.<br/><br/>He donates his life savings to charity and basically becomes a tramp, travelling from place to place and surviving on what he can forage for the main part. He's got no survival skills or expertise, all he has is books.<br/><br/>And that's pretty damn stupid & incredibly arrogant to think he'll make it. He doesn't ever try to contact his family who he estranged himself from. He doesn't really like his parents, he found out his father was married to another women with another child when his mother had him & his sister.<br/><br/>He does seem to like his sister but his father is prone to bouts of aggression & some domestic violence to his mother. Their not a dysfunctional family by any means, they sound like pretty normal average people to me.<br/><br/>This is not their story though, its his story of travelling across America, adopting a new identity (he decides to call himself Alexander Supertramp) and the people who he meets and whose lives he interacts with and for some of them influences and makes changes upon.<br/><br/>The film looks amazing, the locations are beautiful. All the minor characters he meets along the way are also played very well by the supporting cast (Even the normally unbearable Vince Vaughan playing a totally different role from normal shines in this movie). I didn't believe in the character of his father (played by William Hurt) very much, he just didn't convince me.<br/><br/>The eventual ending of this film is quite sad but I won't spoil it. The musical soundtrack is also fantastic, as written by Eddie Veder. Even if your not watching what is quite a long film for the plot or characters then enjoy either the locations or music which add hugely to the very moving story.<br/><br/>It's a bit meandering in places and very difficult to watch in places also but it's worth sticking with. Not a hugely feel good film but quite an interesting story which is based on someones real life.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it."
"ekeby","8","0","1","24 April 2008"," Effective Mixed Message
","I haven't read the book this film was based on, nor do I know anything about the person who inspired the book. So--my opinion is based solely on the film.<br/><br/>I think this is a very effective movie. Despite the fact that I was acutely aware of ""Alexander's"" irresponsibility, I have to acknowledge the that story is compelling and that it draws you in deeply. <br/><br/>I see that a lot of people here are disparaging the film because of the story line: the hero is selfish and self-indulgent. I think that's exactly what's so good about this film. At one level we know the guy is emotionally crippled, and it's hard to describe his behavior as anything other than passive-aggressive to the extreme. On another level we're totally into his experience and we see his life as he sees it. We are able to experience the joy he experiences, even though we're critical of the motivation and ethics of his behavior.<br/><br/>While I was watching I couldn't help thinking what a difficult screenplay this must have been to write. I think it was done extremely well, and I thought the juxtaposition of ""past"" and ""recent past"" was effective.<br/><br/>I was reluctant to watch this movie, but, as it has so many good reviews, it was on my list. I put the DVD in half-expecting to bail on it after a few minutes. I was completely caught up in it right from the beginning.<br/><br/>The one complaint I have was the casting of Vince Vaughn. He's an excellent actor but unfortunately it's no longer possible to separate his acting from his well-publicized persona. It was jarring when he appeared on screen. In South Dakota? This was a case where casting against type was doomed from the get go."

","*** Warning spoilers *** <br/><br/>The title 'into the wild' suggested a movie about the outdoors and outdoor adventures with a little plot to tie it together. That's not what it is. The movie is mostly very sad about a young man strolling towards his demise with many kind people warning him on the way.<br/><br/>If you like sad movies and family drama, it is a nice movie. Don't watch it, because you want to see stunning nature and learn about some great outdoor adventures.<br/><br/>For my taste, it was painfully sad and I wanted to turn off the DVD many times, if I wouldn't have been too curious to find out, if things would get better."

","An uplifting experience. one feels as if one is travelling with the main character on what is his extreme gap year. the premise of watching one person alone with minimal dialogue doesn't bode well but the main actor is so engaging that you feel his emotions in every scene of the film. the film is a triumph of acting and the sure guides of Sean Penn as its director and is ultimately an extremely enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>One criticism could be the characters religious evocation but despite this it is still a wonderful film and a great shame that films such as this do not receive wider circulation and instead we are inundated with pap and dross from the Hollywood machine."

","I've been long procrastinating to watch Into The Wild as I work at BlockBuster video and everyday people ask for this movie. I work in the second smallest store in Western Canada and we only have 30 copies of this movie for customers. Now after watching the film I wish we had a lot more. This is a very nicely shot movie with beautiful scenic shots. I am not a big Sean Penn fan but I thought he played a good role. Vince Vaughn is also in this for a short time and was also was very good as I enjoy his acting. Being a musician myself and a huge fan of Pearl Jam I loved the Eddie Vedder acoustic tracks in the movie. Great music selection in this film with other folk driven music as well. Very sad story which apparently is true. I just thought the narration was a little cheese but at the end when it says that the sister took care of his remains that struck a chord with me. I also loved how this film had a total hippie vibe to it. I loved Rainy and Jan and the nudist hippie's at the end are funny when the old guy is like ""How can you live beside those dope smokin' hippie's"" and Sean Penn says ""Well, they just keep to themselves"". Very Good Film. I'm glad I finally watched it."

"brianrange","8","0","1","22 March 2008"," Solid performances and message
","Into the Wild succeeds in the difficult task of transforming a true life story into true art. The juxtaposition between the ""Magic Bus"" scenes and the scenes of the prior life paint a portrait of extremes. Neither the overly materialistic world of the hero's parents nor the wild world of Alaska prove satisfactory. Rather, the sublime in between world of the farmer, of the old leather worker, and even of the hippies is idealized. Moral of the story is clear and well illustrated: everything in moderation.<br/><br/>The movie reminds me in some ways of the current controversy involving Obama and the Reverend Wright. Reverend Wright's snippets played in the media and YouTube make the mistake of assuming all of America is static and wrong. Yet the media makes the same mistake by turning Reverend Wright into a caricature by only focusing on the ""negative"" things he has said while ignoring the positive real differences he has made in the community. In Wild, the hero makes the same mistake by focusing only on the wrongs of the world while turning a blind eye to the love around him."
"samkan","8","0","1","21 March 2008"," Excellent Though Flawed
","I don't blame Sean Penn for not attempting to ""do"" Krakauer's book. What made the book so interesting was the author's investigation and guesswork about where McCandless was at given points of time and what he must have been thinking of therein (Chris' notes were nowhere near a diary let alone a narrative of his story). Such might make a good documentary but might not be much in the way of drama. Still, this film inherits Jon K's best intentions toward our young hero. In this sense, both the book and the movie share the celebration of reckless, idealistic but well intentioned youth - along with all its folly, stubbornness, narcissism, etc. Kudos for not going overboard on anti-cultural, ecological themes. Might have been a four star affair if it had left out the ""bad-parents-made-me-do-it"" motif."
"cfloyd2643","8","0","1","21 March 2008"," Beautiful, yet so tragic
","This disillusioned young man had so many offers of acceptance along his travels of the US and Mexico, yet he was so damn obsessed with ""going to Alaska"" that he simply turned them down and moved on. He thought that he could simply ""live off the land"" during the summer months in Alaska, and then simply move on to another adventure of his life. He enjoyed many beautiful scenes of nature that many of us will never experience, yet he was doomed to perish sooner or later in these new locations. If his Waterloo was not Alaska, it would be some other remote location. This basic difference in people was best shown in Christopher's scene with the old man in the desert: the old man hid in the desert in his tidy home for most of his adult life to deal with the bad hand his life had dealt him, yet Christopher rejected his offer of adoption and moved on aimlessly. Sad."
"TxMike","Null","0","2","17 March 2008"," Based on a true story, a young man's journey to find himself by going into the wild.
","Emile Hirsch is Chris McCandless, just graduating from college. He is good-looking and bright, and clearly has a bright future. But he is put off by the ""demands"" of society. Why should it be demanded that he further his education? An early sign in the movie was when his mom and dad offered to buy him a new car as a graduation gift. He didn't want it. ""My old car runs just fine, it should last several more years."" <br/><br/>So Chris decided to go off on a personal trek to find out what his life should really be about. He doesn't tell his parents or his younger sister, he just disappears, donating a large chunk of money to charity. He gets rid of all personal identification, and even loses his car in an overnight flash flood in a low spot in the desert.<br/><br/>He adopts a new name, Alex Supertramp, and moves about the country, working at odd jobs here and there, flipping burgers or driving a wheat harvesting machine. He makes many new friends but always moves along soon.<br/><br/>His great quest is to spend time in the Alaska wild, and he makes it there, with a very few supplies and a rifle. His great find is an old bus that had been made into a camp with a stove and a mattress, and that becomes his home. It is difficult but he makes it.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, but I probably don't rate it as highly as many others do. But it was an enjoyable 2+ hours.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden is his mother Billie McCandless and William Hurt is his father Walt McCandless.<br/><br/>SPOILER FOLLOWS: Many who have not even seen the movie know that Chris did not survive his stay in Alaska, but it was an unusual death. Hungry, he used books to identify safe berries for human consumption. But one night he fell very ill and when he double-checked the identity it tuned out to be a berry that blocks nutrition absorption, and there was no cure. So he died of starvation. Just after he had figured out what his purpose in life was, and he was on his way back to civilization to share his gifts with others."

","So let's start with my original thought. That here is this kid..who has money growing up..never wants for anything. Yet he abandons it, to live independently and free of materialism. OK..admirable..yes..but like some other comments I have read on here, What were the parents real sins? They were flawed? They had a bad marriage...They did not disclose everything to their kids? Hmm..sounds about like 95pct of the world's parents. I am still a relatively young man and it irks me the idea that generations are entitled to have chips on their shoulder about the way they were raised. Like it is some kind of war they fought and now they want the medal. I am sure there is kid in some project tenement building who is living under the same conditions that this kid volunteered for. Perhaps suffering abuse every day, verbal and physical. Maybe one day this kid gets a break..goes to college and becomes something. Hey..now that is a story for me. ""Into Reality"" I will call it. I could not generate any sympathy for this kid..no matter how I tried. Now..i Rated this a 7 cause there were some very wonderful moments in this movie. First and foremost, In a movie about individualism and being a free spirit, the most powerful parts of the movie involved the characters he met along the way. From Keener to Vaughn to especially they young singer he befriended. They all came across so convincing as people who were genuinely touched by this young man and were all the worse off when he left them. Hal Holbrook in a small role with mostly body language and facial expressions had me remembering people in my life..who want to hold on to you even though they know they can't. Overall..in this day and age, to see a kid who could go off and do whatever he wants but chooses this..to me..that is a story worth telling. The kid was obviously different and different is refreshing. Great soundtrack, great acting by all involved, a bit long and William Hurt was underused but believe me, at times you will be asking...why is making his parents suffer so much. I am a parent..and for the parents out there..not knowing where your child is..whether he is 8 or 18...is not something to shrug off as a subplot...Penn had the right idea here..and he did well, but it was a bit one sided and made it appear like the kid was petulant and self indulgent instead of just Thoreauesque."
"jeromeerome","9","0","1","13 March 2008"," Beautiful scenes and soundtrack. Epic story with unthinkable circumstances.
","The combination of unique and memorable characters, epic story telling, unthinkable circumstances, beautiful scenery and outstanding folk music soundtrack by Eddie Vedder make this a movie that is truly worth experiencing.<br/><br/>Into the Wild is a retelling of a true story based on the last years of a young man's life and his spiritual journey to find himself. That man is Chris Mccandless. Shortly after graduating from Emory University in 1990 Mccandless abandoned his family, his upper-middle class background and all his material possessions. He donated his entire life savings to charity and destroyed all his personal identification. Then he set out into the world with only the clothes he had on his back.<br/><br/>The film follows Mccandless for those two years as he traveled all over the US and into Mexico. Along this journey you are exposed to all the beautiful, natural landscapes and the deep relationships developed with the wide variety of people who he meets along the way.<br/><br/>Mccandless ultimate goal is to remove himself from society completely and journey alone into the wilderness of Alaska. This idea was partly inspired by his favorite author Jack London who wrote ""White Fang"" and ""The Call of the Wild"". He sees this as his final path to his true freedom and spiritual awakening.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of jumping between his time in Alaska and flashbacks two years earlier as he traveled across the US. This avoids a scenario like the movie ""Castaway"" were there is little to no dialog for long periods of time. There is never a dull moment in Into the Wild. When it is all over you will be left with mixed emotions and possibly reflecting on the current state of your own life."

In some ways, it seems like a life that one would like to live. On the other hand, you look at it and say that there is no way that you could live the life of the main character portrayed in the movie. It is REALLY food for thought.

Chris' story is incredibly powerful and helps me to see what changes I must make in order to be happy. I rarely see films that influence me in this way.

"Kvasir1","9","0","1","3 March 2008"," It just worked for me
","I had never heard of the book nor did I know anything about the movie before I saw this. The only thing I knew about this film was that it was directed by Sean Penn, and had some acclaim.<br/><br/>When it started there was a sort of visceral reaction. The movie began with the monologue of what was presumably the main character. It proceeded to develop this main character in the most cliché way possible. With the stark contrast of ""here he is now, this is where he was before, and this is why he might end up in the place he is now."" It was just disappointing, alas I chugged on.<br/><br/>The development style was not the only cliché aspect of this film, the cinematography as well as all of the grandiose outdoors scenes were sometimes just too much.<br/><br/>Though all of these things are there to detract from the film, the main character is interesting, Emile Hirsch's portrayal is phenomenal, and the plot was engaging.<br/><br/>The film develops heavily within naturalistic philosophies and showcases the journey of the main character on his way to self-discovery. It ends with a great moment of self-actualization, where Emile Hirsch's character understands who he his and his place in the world (in the tradition of American Beauty, though more explicit).<br/><br/>The bottom line is that even though I have a strong visceral and negative intellectual reaction to the film style, in the end it works for me. By the time I get to the end I don't care about any of the technical aspects of the film, the story as well as the main character far outshines the little technical flaws. I found myself thoroughly captivated throughout the entire film. With only a few moments where I stop and think, ""wow, you've got to be kidding me"".<br/><br/>It in every way was captured by the movie, and the movie in some ways (keeping in mind I saw the movie before reading the book) is more powerful than the book.<br/><br/>Maybe it's that I'm originally from Wyoming, or that I'm just a sucker for Russian literature, but in the end this film just worked for me. I do, in the end, highly recommend it. Even if it doesn't work in the same way for you, it still has important meaning, and is no waste of time."

"KUAlum26","9","0","1","19 February 2008"," Must be seen--no,experienced-- to be believed
","I was already pretty well aware of this film from last fall,the story(or the broad outline of it anyway) of Christopher McCandless,the University graduate from a fairly well-to-do family who chucks his fortune and material goods to go up into rural Alaska,directed by Sean Penn and adapted off the book by JOn Krackhauer(spelling?). I was,initially,not sure how much I wanted to see this,but as time passed and heard more reviews and reactions,I became pretty certain that I wanted to see it,and after somewhat of a wait,I was finally able to.<br/><br/>I preface all of this because while seeing this,I was still awestruck,caught by things I'm not sure I was even prepared for. <br/><br/>McCandless(Emile Hirsch,in a profound performance that is both physical AND mental) spends the better part of(actually,I think it WAS) two years after graduating Emory University in Atlanta chucking his educational money and possessions to live a more ""authentic"" and ""truthful"" life,based at least in part on the book he's read (much of it THoreau,Tolstoy,Emerson,Lord Byron and Dostoyevsky). Through much of the two-and-three-quarters hours running time,we go on the journey in somewhat non-linear fashion, with reflections on both the journey itself and the narration of McCandless' loyal and heartbroken sister(Jena Malone,who was possibly my favorite element of this film). What we get is both a visual exploration of the wilds of Western America and Mexico and a bit of a meditation on personal desires and ambitions,be they foolish,noble or (quite possibly) both.<br/><br/>Supporting turns by Hal Holbrook (as the elderly loner who sees in McCandless--now known as Alex Supertramp--as the grandson he always wanted), CAtherine Keener (as the good-natured hippie who secretly pains for Chris/Alex's parents and family), Brian Dierker(as Keener's similar husband), Vince Vaughn (as the good-natured farmer who befriends Chris/Alex as he employs him),Kristen Stewart (as the hippie child who fancies him), Marcia Gay Harden (somewhat subdued as Chris' mother) and William Hurt (slightly bolder as Chris' materialistic father) truly set the tone for the story. Sean Penn's direction may even be a little heavy-handed for him (I personally liked his touches on ""The Crossing Guard"" or ""The Pledge"" better), but it still is made with a scope that makes the story full,beautiful,tragic and even poetic.<br/><br/>I noticed,through flipping through some reviews and message posts on it's IMDb site,that this film has encouraged about as many negative reactions as positive,mostly couched in the complaint that McCandless is portrayed as a beatific,almost religious character,a tragic hero that is fully realized. I would say that,while I can get where some people would feel that,I am of a mind that McCandless(certainly through the book,and possibly through the film,even if by accident) is actually a somewhat complex character: at once sympathetic and noble,yet painfully selfish and thoughtlessly cruel. He is both incredibly bright and yet a big enough fool to orchestrate his own demise. I may come to feel some affinity for the character(and I did) but I also realize that he was not hardly a flawless person. I suspect that anyone who sees this film may be the most satisfied by the movie if they can make this balance.<br/><br/>Anchored by haunting music composed by Michael Brook,Kaki GAutier and Eddie Vedder(who lends his voice to it as well) and breathtaking cinematography by Eddie Gautter,this movie is well worth a look,because descriptions cannot quite do this justice on their own."

I'm glad that there are still existing people capable doing this kind of movie. Keep on going people, keep on sending us the beauty of this world and the joy of this life."

","Beautiful film which captures the spirit of the book. Sean Penn's direction deserved an Academy Award nomination as did Emile Hirsch's remarkable performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography is first-rate & the soundtrack with Eddie Vedder is a perfect match. My only advice to read the book before seeing the film, as each stands on its own. Mr. Penn is a great director who is capable of getting the best out of the entire cast. Every actor seems very real throughout & Emile Hirsch brings to life Chris Mccandless's wanderlust.<br/><br/>Mccandless comes from a seemingly perfect family whose secrets are the reason for the escape away from society that he chooses. He will find out that no matter how far you travel, the problems remain. This is a very sad but compelling drama about a search for the meaning of life, without being overly simplistic."

","There are several things in our lives that we do not choose and these things therefore have the potential to be experienced as tyrannical elements of our life. Our parents and society could be two suggestions. We do not choose them ourselves but we really don't have other alternative but to accept them and try and get along. Or what? For the young man Christopher McCandless there is an alternative. To quit it all and become a super-tramp with the ultimate goal of ""going into the wild"". The Wild is in this particular instance Alaska.<br/><br/>For Chris this alternative way of dealing with the tyranny of his life also means that he for some reason does not tell anybody that he will split and live his life as a vagabond. He just leaves without a word to anybody and even takes on a new identity (Alexander Supertramp) in order not to be located (maybe this change in name could also be seen as an attempt to change his identity on a psychological level). I have been thinking much about this and my conclusion is, that he either left without saying because he was afraid that if so his parents would and could persuade him not to leave or else he didn't tell them because he in some way wanted to hurt them. Either way we don't know this as it was not explored in depth and this also means that we really don't know how Chris felt about leaving everybody without saying a single word.<br/><br/>Without focus on this aspect I think that it is very tendentious picture that is drawn of Chris. I think that he was struggling much more with personal issues than was shown to us. How could he bear not to let his sister know that he was well?<br/><br/>I liked in particular those chance meetings Chris had along his way that developed into so much; that is a unique thing about traveling.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for a slow, ""small-stream"" and poetic movie then I can recommend this movie without hesitation.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."
"vovazhd","7","0","1","15 February 2008"," Solid film, but fell short of my expectations
","Into the Wild is a road-trip/biography film based on a true story about an adventurer named Christopher McCandless. After college graduation, he decides to give away all his possessions and hide from society. He adopts the name Alex Supertramp and travels across the United States, making money from small jobs. At the same time, he finds time to experience the beauty of nature. Eventually, he decides to journey into the Alaskan wilderness alone.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch does a good job acting as Alex. Although I can't say I was entirely impressed his performance, I respect him because of the difficulty of the role. The fact that he was believable was one of the main things that made the film work.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat convoluted, alternating between his adventure in Alaska and his previous experiences around continental United States. For much of the film, I did not feel like I was connecting with the events or emotions that Alex was experiencing. The pacing was rather slow as well. There were some things, such as the problems with Alex's parents, that were unclear. Toward the end, it did get better. The final scene was simply beautiful. Despite this, its difficult not to label the film as overlong.<br/><br/>Into the Wild holds high standards in direction and editing. The environmental scenes are a clear contrast to the bland city or slum segments. They are beautifully shot and panned. There are some neat effects, such as slow motion or stylistic blurring, that add a nice touch.<br/><br/>The film fell short of the expectations that I built up from significant critical praise. Some parts were very well done, but as a whole it was too idle. But I did find value in it, even though I disagreed with several of the main messages. All in all, it was a solid but unspectacular adventure."
"jacob-noergaard","8","0","1","13 February 2008"," Great movie with a message
","I saw the movie (DVD release) and liked it very much. Not that it inspired me to shed myself of my material belongings or anything like that, but the message - or rather the messages - were quite good and there is much to be said in defense of Chris' actions. The freedom must really be a powerful feeling.<br/><br/>But I daresay he wasn't really that happy when he died. Clearly his relationship to his sister was close. Clearly he must have loved her. Therefore I fail to believe he was truly happy, having left this world without having seen her - or his parents for that long.<br/><br/>Actually he was a very selfish man. Come on, at least give word to the family. But no, he didn't seem to care. Very selfish if you ask me.<br/><br/>Oh and what's with the credits listing? The danish couple he meets on his kayak journey, the guy states his name is ""Mads"" (that's also what the subtitles say), not ""Thomas"".<br/><br/>All in all still a moving film that deserves the 8 I gave it."

","Enlightenment comes from experiencing. If you never had anything, how can you ever give up anything? I recently watched a movie that tells a totally opposite story. It was about a young Tibetan monk who walked away from the life of detachment and lived for a while like a normal person, fell in love, got married and had children ... until one day, he walked away again, back to the life of detachment and seclusion. On the contrary, Into the wild tells a story about a young man who try to run away from civilization and be alone with the nature.<br/><br/>Deep in the core of these two opposite stories lies the same bare naked truth of humanity. There are something one can never seem to escape no matter where you are and what kind of life you are living.<br/><br/>Here's our young hero, torn and tired of the inconsistency, viciousness and lies of his parents and the toll that it's taking on his conscience, decided to just walk away, far far away from everything as humanly as possible. He took on a symbolic journey to seek the absolute truth that's free from the contamination of human touch. He walked ""Into the wild"" with all of his arrogance and earnest, equipped with nothing but his stubborn grip and fascination on a place called Alaska, where true meaning of life can be found.<br/><br/>On some level, it reminded me of my younger self, and all the anguish and suffocation I experienced after the teen years. The time when we were old enough to supposedly bear the burden of decision making yet not quite experienced enough to weigh in all the choices. The time when life was all of a sudden upon us.<br/><br/>On a very personal level, quite strangely, this movie hit me hardest not with its depiction of the wild but the depiction of human interaction. To me, that's where it truly shines brightly, so brightly that it washed out the dark and lonely hours of ""Into the wild"".<br/><br/>This is not the kind of movie that gives you any closure. There's no triumph nor enlightenment. It present a slice of life as it is, charming and flawed like the main character. Contrast to young McCandless' bleak and cynical world view, you will only remember his bright and innocent smile, the warm sparkles in his eyes, the brief yet achingly beautiful moments of human interaction that he often abruptly run away from.<br/><br/>You may not necessarily learn anything from the main character, but you will definitely draw something truly valuable from his experience. Somewhere in a dark and obscure corner of the earth, there's a Chris McCandless lay underneath the stars, gazing on its vast tranquility, dreaming of his Alaska. For me, Chris McCandless didn't go ""Into the Wild"", he went into himself, searching for an idea, a moment of pure authenticity, something that had eluded him."

I have no idea where that river came from in the end making it impossible for (what's his name) to get back. Was that river newly formed? I hate hunters and don't think the killing of a moose was worth his 'experience'. You wouldn't think so either if you were the moose. The scenery was beautiful and the music set a nice tone. The performances were all good, especially Hal Holbrook, a kind lonely old man with no one to love. But 'what's his face' didn't care about anybody or anything. He hurts everyone he knows with his childish ""the worlds a bad place"" attitude. As if it's something only he notices. Da grow up dude. It's the happiness you give others that make life count for something. How about just go save a dog. there's enough of those that need love."

","ON THE ROAD by Jack Kerouac was published 50 years before this film came out. And then there was Voltaire's CANDIDE. Can the Enlightenment be so very far away? A lot of people get irritated with Holden Caufield when they read CATCHER IN THE RYE. A lot of people react the same way when they encounter Christopher McCandless and they WILL encounter his persona on screen for years to come, thanks to Sean Penn. Why this irritation? It's like asking why the squares got irritated with the gatherings of gentle people at Monterey Pop during that ""Summer of Love"" in 1967 Frisco : in essence, people like Christopher McCandless remind them of their own ""lives of quiet desperation"" of what 60s freaks called, ""the death culture"".<br/><br/>Christopher McCandless is a well read guy. He pulls out his Jack London and Leo Tolstoy in order to be closer, to relax with his friends. He's had it with what Holden Caufield called,""phonies"" and these include his lying parents. Generation gap redux, mai oui. <br/><br/>Christopher McCandless wants to discover Truth. And to do this, he ventures out ""on the road"" as Dean Moriarity and Sal Paradise did in 1947, hitching and driving and being driven all over America and even down to Mexico, just as Sal and Dean did. And just as Dean and Sal were, Christopher McCandless is searching for IT. <br/><br/>But what is IT? <br/><br/>Christopher McCandless only knows that IT isn't the narrow materialistic individualism of his parents or of people like them. He fervently believes in a ""spiritual"" path which might lead one to IT, but first he must divest himself of crass materialism-- most worldly goods . For, unlike the rich man/camel who cannot pass through the eye of a needle, Christopher McCandless will make it into his heaven because he refuses excess material. He believes in his vow of poverty. So did the Buddah and a thousand Beats and Hippies. He believes that he must make contact with the ""spiritual"" truth by living simply, living like a character out of one of Jack London's adventurous Alaskan adventures. It is a call of the wild which draws him, north, ever north to the Alaska outback. There, he reads Tolstoy's words on how to achieve happiness through simple living and he takes that advice on, living in his own ""Magic Bus""...oh shades of Kesey may your spirit live on.<br/><br/>Is it true? Can one find ""spiritual"" fulfillment this way? Perhaps. Especially, if one is inclined to try to find it standing on its head, as the priest in ""The Black Robe"" did in his 17th Century Canadian wilderness trek amongst the native heathen. Religious quests are almost always filled with suffering. Is this not why we were placed on this Earth, like so many chess pieces for the amusement of our Lard.<br/><br/>But, in material reality what hath Penn wrought? This is a lad with all the right instincts for freedom, still tied in knots with philosophical Idealism. He's trying to kick out the jams; but he doesn't realize that heading down the path of material deprivation will not get him home--free. As a result of his ""true believer"" mentality, poor Christopher McCandless doesn't recognize his real happiness when it stares him, lovingly in his face. Ah sweet Tracy... He sees the poverty of a future of dead time in the suburbs and he rejects it. Good move, Chris. This rejection makes a lot of the one-dimensional individuals hate him, especially when his disdain is magnified on the silver screen. He sees the wisdom of NOT ""taking more than you can use"" from the Earth, a fact that is brought home hard for him when he shoots a moose, he cannot possibly consume. Hooray for Christopher McCandless there! <br/><br/>Christopher McCandless made some discoveries. Like Candide, Sal Paradise, Holden Caufield and the people of his own parents' generation, especially ones who can be seen on in docos like ""Monterey Pop"", he did glimpse IT here and there, only to lose it in the end. For it is in the social relations of friendship and love, all of which he leaves behind in order to live on his own, in a vain attempt to depend only his own, narrow individualism to find ""the truth"". The ghost of Dean Moriarity, walking down those railroad tracks in Mexico...yes, Dean More-E-air-IT-tee."
"rodolfoIII","8","0","1","6 January 2008"," Understandable until the very end!
","To understand this movie, one have to look into ones soul and try to understand one's purpose is in world really is and what it all means at the end? Which I presume is partly the reason why Mr. Sean Penn made Mr. Krakauer's book into a movie. In Chris McCandless' world the notions of material excess and gratification comes second or even last. This also allowed him to adopt a philosophy that money does not bring the sole meaning in life as his dad tried to masquerade his own wrong doings with materialistic possessions. Though the journey that Chris McCandless undertakes throughout the country in order to find some meaning to his life, it also gives him some answers, that were staring at him in the face all along. By this, I mean that all of the connections that Chris severed with his real family, he also sort of had to make on the road with his new surrogate family. Ironically the fact that he never once called home to tell his family, where he was it is both (his natural & surrogate) families that feel his loss. There is no doubt that along with the message, music, panorama vistas, Emile Hirsch, Hal Holbrook's performance that this movie will win an award. By the time the real Chris McCandless death I too was coming to an end of my own journey which lasted 8 years (and began at 17 years old), into the wilderness to some of the harshest climates and even I always followed the rules to this day. Which is why the end of this movie shocks me to this day. According to the locals Chris refused the following 1) a local map and 2) winter gear. In addition there was a bridge a few miles he could have traversed during flashflood season and 10 miles away there was a shelter with resupplies. After learning, all of this, Iam still not sure how to take this movie. Though it made me shed a tear at the end, the message I got from it, is when it comes to nature and family humility may be your greatest salvation."
"gelatin25","7","0","2","4 December 2007"," A Most Noble Effort
","While not nearly as good as the book, I commend Sean Penn's efforts as it must have been very difficult to adapt this tale of Chris McCandless's fatal Alaskan odyssey. Also worth mentioning is Eddie Vedder's superb acoustically-driven score, his first ever.<br/><br/>As one might expect from a Penn movie, he casts many notable names, including William Hurt as the stereotypical cold father, Catherine Keener as a nomadic hippie, Vince Vaughn, and a surprisingly energetic Hal Holbrook. Emile Hirsch plays Chris decently enough, showing noticeable dedication (he must have really lost weight towards the end) but still does not stand out as much as the more veteran-like supporting cast.<br/><br/>Penn includes some nice subtle touches, such as actual black and white footage of apartheid and other social and political crises of Africa as Chris's sister names out his final courses and grades from Emory University. At times he goes overboard though, indulging in clichés like an overhead shot of Chris swimming naked on his back with his arms stretched out like Jesus on the cross. I found the most powerful scene to be but a close-up photograph of the real Chris McCandless as he sat scruffy-bearded and grinning outside of the vacant bus he made his home, an enlarged and color version of the same photograph from inside the book.<br/><br/>As I was finishing the book I thought this would make for a fascinating Werner Herzog documentary in the tradition of ""Grizzly Man."" McCandless falls into that same kind of iconoclastic realm as any one of Herzog's protagonists. Penn gives us the romanticized Hollywood version."

","I was holding off reviews of this film until after I had read the book and actually seen the movie. I like how faithful it was to the book, though parts had to be condensed for brevity. I found it interesting because I had actually been to many of the places that Chris had visited and was glad to see that it was filmed on location except for the part at the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park (I did not see it in the film credits I am familiar with the area where Chris lived). An area near Palm Springs was substituted instead.<br/><br/>I found the acting and storyline to be very good, but parts of the film seemed overdone and over dramatic. Some of the slow-motion shots were not necessary and seemed a little dumb, though.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was a good movie and was interesting to watch all the way through. If you've read the book first, you won't be disappointed. I usually don't like to read the book first because I don't like the changes they make in the movies, but this film did the book good."
