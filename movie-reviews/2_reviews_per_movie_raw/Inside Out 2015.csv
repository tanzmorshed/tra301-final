","Oh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created.
I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified.
All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her.
The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen.
The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team.
Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression.
The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one.
It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion.
Now, let's talk about the ending.
When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
True happiness cannot exist without sadness.
This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life."

Great movie for both kids and adults."
"james-calver","9","396","666","9 July 2016"," I feel like everybody has missed the point
","I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.<br/><br/>The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. <br/><br/>From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. <br/><br/>Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come."
"Sweetigal85","10","42","67","28 May 2017"," A brilliant depiction of adolescence
","As an adult, I love animated films but the trailers made this one look like it was really just for kids. I gave it a shot anyway and I didn't expect to love it--but it's depth absolutely shocked me. Not only is it a whimsical, funny film, but the poetry is off the charts.<br/><br/>The creators of this film truly remember what it was like to be a child and continue to express understanding to children's feelings today. Riley is a light hearted little girl on the cusp of adolescence, approaching that turbulent age where everything changes and it seems like there is no one there to help you.<br/><br/>Riley's emotions are portrayed using colorful creatures inside her head. Joy has been the ringleader of the emotions up until now, but Riley's life changes are starting to shake things up and Sadness has begun to take over. Truly amazing how this was depicted! Absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>As a kid, adults are often dismissing your emotions and never listening to you when you need them most. Often times kids cannot express themselves and turn to anger, panic or disgust, all emotions that will only heighten your problems as Riley comes to learn.<br/><br/>When Joy finally lets Sadness take the reins and Riley opens up to her parents and they actually LISTEN to her...it is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on this movie, definitely a must see! Amazing voice cast, beautiful visuals and a wonderful message to people of all ages."
"acohen090","10","130","234","28 July 2018"," How?
","Wtf people. I was just reading like several one reviews and how do people get a movie so wrong?! It should be pg-13? It's not for children? Are these people out of there freaking mind? For all of you who feel that it's not for children, take a look again. <br/><br/>You severely underestimate of how much emotion a child can handle and you would be suprised. The 1 star reviews are almost laughable about how inaccurate they are. These people should be locked up in a jail for attempting to stop bringing this movie to the world. I absolutely love Inside Out, it was one of my favorite movies of 2015, and I hope you 1 Star people live your lives full of misery."
"Animany94","10","50","85","23 November 2017"," Mandatory watch for children and parents alike.
","I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point. <br/><br/>Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one. <br/><br/>Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them. <br/><br/>The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection. <br/><br/>I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments. <br/><br/>You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch."
"Aang1","10","217","421","10 July 2015"," Amazing movie- Those who bash it because it is not a kid's movie, please stop
","I've noticed a plethora of negative reviews all saying the same thing- their kids did not enjoy/ understand the movie and it was too dark. Yet they also say that the movie was well made and had an excellent concept. My question to these people is this- If you wanted to see a happy meaningless movie with adult toilet humour, why didn't you take your kids to see Minions? Inside out is for those who like quality cinema, to be entertained as well as taught challenging concepts. It is an artistic film. Why do you people always have to assume that all animated films have to be for kids and filled with stupid toilet humour? This is Pixar we are talking about, those who have created Wall-E and Up. Review this movie on its own merits, rather than be biased in your judgement that the film was too dark and confusing for kids. It was never marketed as a film for toddlers and little kids. I went with my brother who is in high school and it was one of the best experiences we had in the cinema in a very long time. Kudos to Pixar; it was truly an amazing, advanced conceptual, artistic film."
"Heinzwill","10","70","129","29 July 2016"," Beyond Words...
","It's been nearly a year since I first saw this film. I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.<br/><br/>This is my favourite film ever.<br/><br/>Like I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.<br/><br/>Yet this is still my favourite film of all-time.<br/><br/>80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.<br/><br/>Ever since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).<br/><br/>Inside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.<br/><br/>In the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.<br/><br/>You can vote ""not helpful"" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.<br/><br/>I will never forget Inside Out."
"OliverGinger","10","357","736","20 September 2015"," Tears of Joy
","Before I start, I will say this; I'm writing this after coming back from a second viewing of Inside Out. Both viewings were out of choice. That's not a unique thing, but I very rarely watch films more than once at the cinema, mainly because life is short, or rather, life is too quick for me. But there's two main reasons why people watch some films more than once at the cinema, especially where I come from; either the film was interesting, detailed, or multi-layered and needs to be seen again to sink in properly, or, it was really, really good.<br/><br/>In this case, for me, it's the latter. That's not to say that the film isn't interesting, detailed or multi-layered, but the reason that was repeating in my head to see it again was 'it's really, really good.' But is it? Yes, yes of course it is... Speaking with a bunch of friends with whom I saw it the first time, a risky phrase was unanimously agreed upon, which was that we 'trust the Pixar team to do the right thing.' Needless (totally needless) to say that expectations were high, and frankly, they were surpassed.<br/><br/>Even though the film is what we come to expect from Pixar (the universal moral themes, the perfect balance between comedy and sadness, and visually stunning animation and action sequences), I didn't feel that I had seen it all before, and neither was it repetitive nor 'ordinary'. The film hits all the high notes, with perfect intonation, and with discipline and passion. As touched on before, the balance between humour and sadness is strong and impressive; the amount of emotions that the film displays and takes us through is varied and immersive, yet not overwhelming. The film executes such clever ideas with simplicity and ease, leaving us to feel for the characters rather than worry about the 'science' of it all, or even being worried about 'not getting it'.<br/><br/>The animation is constantly eye-drawing and detailed; the characters' glistening skin is particularly wondrous. And what great characters they are. Riley is brilliantly sympathetic throughout, even with her difficult mood swings, and the supporting characters are perfectly entertaining. One might think that the superficial nature of the characters (Anger is angry, Fear is always scared etc.) would become old quickly, however the fun never diminishes, thanks to a witty script, expressive animation, and very strong voice performances from the entire cast.<br/><br/>However, to top all this off, the real gem comes from the character of Joy, surely a strong contender in the list of Pixar's greatest characters. Even though we are inside the head of Riley for the majority of the film, and the events that drive the movie are essentially her reactions to her new world (moving from Minnesota to San Francisco), the story is Joy's. Being probably the most flawed character in the film (paradoxically, maybe), it's her journey we care about the most, and she ends up being the most in-depth character in the film, occasionally questioning her actions in the first half (well, the cynics will be), and becoming the most sympathetic by the end. Amy Poehler's outstanding performance makes Joy simultaneously the strongest and weakest character in the film (emotionally, that is).<br/><br/>After all of this, the freshness of the ideas, the simplified neuroscience, the technical brilliance (saying that, Giacchino's score is probably the most subtle thing in the film, exquisitely putting the finishing touches on the most emotional scenes), fleshed out characters and universal themes, all of this comes together simply to entertain us, to let us escape, and to release us emotionally, which it does by making us laugh and cry in an even and fair manner.<br/><br/>And you will laugh. And you will cry. And it is fun to do so. Thank god we're living in a time when Pixar is making these films."

","For every child, growing up can be exciting, confusing, and difficult. For Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco, Riley is directed by her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) in Headquarters Control Center inside Riley's mind to help her overcome everyday life. However, Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to Riley's new life in San Francisco and emotional disorder arises. Although Joy, Riley's main and most fundamental emotion, tries to keep things optimistic, the emotions fight on how best to navigate Riley's new world.<br/><br/>After watching ""Inside Out"" with my wife, we both agreed that ""Inside Out"" is the perfect Pixar Animation movie for any family on a night out. It was both imaginative and relatable for both children and adults. I never thought ""Inside Out"" would be this enjoyable, but I was able to experience every emotion of ""Joy"", ""Disgust"", ""Anger"", ""Fear"", and ""Sadness"" for each and every moment of this film. At the end of the night, I was pleasantly unsatisfied because I wanted to watch the movie again and again. Parents, if you're looking for a fun filled movie night with your children, this movie will not only please them, but you as well.<br/><br/>A Definite 9!! Well done Pixar!"
"mohan59","9","192","393","21 September 2015"," An artistic triumph
","For some reason, I couldn't quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did! <br/><br/>As far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase ""emotions are what makes us human""! <br/><br/>I recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.<br/><br/>Certainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy's ""A-ha"" moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.<br/><br/>In terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind's performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.<br/><br/>Inside Out is every bit a Pixar fan's well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem."
"Marjeez","8","136","280","17 May 2015"," This is the Pixar I Know and Love
","Please excuse any mistakes as my English is not very good. There are no spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>I had the pleasure of seeing 'Inside Out' at the Cannes Film Festival and I must say it was wonderful and a huge step-up from Pixar's recent efforts. The trailers don't really do it justice. The story may seem complicated for younger viewers, but the way Pixar tells the story fits for both adults and children. The pacing is in the vein of Wall-E, and in that sense it is very much a film for adults as it is for kids (like most Pixar movies). The story here is surprisingly raw and emotional, one that has very deep underlying themes that adults will connect with. Many of the audience members were crying at the end. It has one of the most original stories for an animation in the last few years, and I believe many people (especially adults) will form a connection to it.<br/><br/>Speaking of animation, the film is breathtakingly beautiful. There is a nice contrast of colors that make it look vibrant, like Pixar's 'UP'. The voice cast did a wonderful job and you couldn't ask for better direction from Pete Doctor and co. I cannot wait to see this a second time with family and friends. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>PS: The short that played before the film, 'Lava', was also beautiful. It was sort of a musical, and it was quite funny and clever. The audience even applauded at the end of it, myself included. In that sense, it provides the entire package a nice balance of joy and laughter (Lava) followed by deep storytelling and emotion (Inside Out)."
"matthewssilverhammer","10","167","351","26 June 2015"," Best Pixar Since Toy Story
","After some ho-hum years and too many sequels, Pixar is back and better than ever with Inside Out, a boldly unique animated film that renews our faith in what a giant studio can do with an original concept. Docter combines the strengths of his two Pixar masterworks here: the endless inventiveness of Monster's Inc. and the poignant strength of Up. A truly fantastic mixture of fantasy-adventure-comedy and small-family-drama, it's a genius work of conception, execution and emotion that will go down in the annals of Disney animation as an instant and enduring classic. It follows Joy, the leading-emotion of an 11-year-old girl, as she tries to navigate a big change in her young life. Much like Toy Story 3, we're shown the inherent difficulties of growing up through a fresh viewpoint, learning what makes you ""you"". It's a convoluted idea that's nearly impossible to explain, and yet Pixar nails it, perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease. The humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids and adults in equal stitches, with fantastic turns from everyone, notably Poehler, Smith, Black, and Kind. However, this film's high-point may be the multiple emotional gut-punches that will reduce parents to tears. That fearlessness to be gloomy is basically the thesis of the film: true joy comes when every emotion is allowed to be recognized and dealt with healthfully. It's quite a psychologically complex stance to take for a film that manages to be so kid-friendly. This wonderful balancing act helps make Inside Out worthy of the ""M"" word (masterpiece) and gives it the distinction of being Pixar's best since the unparalleled Toy Story."
"jaydawiser","1","416","914","13 July 2015"," Very boring for a children's movie
","I had high hopes of Inside Out before heading to the movie theater to go see it. The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre near them. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in this movie. <br/><br/>I have to admit that the idea of the story was great and very creative, especially to young children. Other than that, the lack of character development and no good plot development ruined the entire film for me.<br/><br/>Almost the entire movie consists of Joy and Sadness walking around that large area of Riley's memories, attempting to find their way back to headquarters, while the other emotions nonchalantly mess everything up (I don't get why Joy was the only emotion with some commonsense). Of course, along the way, they met a spunky elephant (mixed with some other animals) who managed to make situations worse more than making them better, and of course, he had to die at the end because, reality check, it's a Disney film. And their goal is to somehow make you cry one way or another. I just didn't get how the elephant disappeared so quickly, considering he hadn't been down the forgotten memory abyss that long. If the memories died so quickly like he had, why were their thousands of old grey memories still intact? <br/><br/>Anyway, that's only a small screw-up compared to the rest of the movie. I felt like I had been constantly waiting for more character development for Riley but once again, I was let down. The entire movie revolved more around the emotions more than Riley, who from the trailer, seemed to be the star of the show. I could go on and on about the huge flaws and plot holes but I only have a limit of a thousand words. Do yourself a favor and spare the $7.50 and wasted hour that you'll never get back. I wouldn't watch that movie again if my life depended on it."

","I have been a Pixar fan since the Luxo Jr. days and watched their acquisition by Disney with trepidation. After seeing Inside Out, it appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots, excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise, it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending. It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend thought the movie and short were ""babyish"". I'm waiting until they make a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye, bye Pixar. I'll miss you."

","I'm like various reviewers who consider themselves Pixar fans. In fact, I'm an animated film fan and try to see the award winners whenever I can. The beautiful colors and well developed art of Pixar is most often worth the cost of admission to me. But Inside Out is so awful it drove me and my significant other from the theater. The concept is much too heavy and involved to hold the attention of a child. Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness. Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive, with the emotional balls in the air, flailing here and there. The characters in Pixar, have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures. ""Joy"" is reminiscent of other females from past movies. This time, the female lead is so over-the-top that, after a short while, I wanted to shout ""shut up and go away!"" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two. I came away feeling that I'd been emotionally beaten up yet bored to tears.

","I am genuinely confused as to why people are calling this ""Pixar's Best"" or an original concept. Pixar has done far better than this and even the mediocre 'Brave' and 'Cars' are far better.<br/><br/>Not only is the concept of 'people controlling your brain' tired and used multiple times, they managed to make it even more boring. There is absolutely no nuance in this film. The characters, (joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness), are a visual representation of their emotion. I mean seriously, do they understand subtlety at all? Anger literally catches on fire, sadness is blue, and joy looks like every boring same-faced cartoon princess. Not to mention none of the emotions look like Riley, the little girl. This is even more of a flaw when we later see the emotions in other characters heads, (Riley's parents, her teacher, etc.) who look just like the person whose brain they inhabit. Why would Riley be the only one whose emotions all look nothing like her? They took an old concept, made it incredibly literal, and then botched it up with inconsistencies. <br/><br/>Aside from the boring concept, this movie is way too complex and depressing for children. The plot is nearly nonexistent and the most constant thing throughout is joy and sadness attempting to get back to the control center of Riley's brain after being sucked out by accident. Other than that its all very dull and if it doesn't make you cry, you'll probably fall asleep. There are, from what I remember, no laugh out loud jokes. Way too much time went into world-building and showing off the various landscapes and rooms of Riley's mind for there to be any actual storyline. Everything felt extremely dragged out and joy and sadness ran into obstacle after obstacle trying to get back to the control center. Finally, Riley tries to run away and it just so happens that joy returns and fixes everything before she has the chance to get too far. Not only was it absurd for an 11 year old girl to try and take a bus back home, it was far too sad the way the whole thing was shown. <br/><br/>There were so many random characters introduced for 5 seconds which served no purpose other than to lighten the mood, and they failed at that too. Bing Bong the imaginary friend who was a furry pink elephant was out of place and his design was really uncreative. When he died, I honestly felt relieved not to hear his irritating voice any more. He had no personality or character development and therefore there wasn't any reason to feel sad when he died. Unles of course you're a little kid in which case the whole thing was way too heavy. Either way its a definite miss.<br/><br/>And for those saying only psychology majors can enjoy this movie, that's not true. I can't imagine anyone honestly liking this movie. Aside from the complete inaccuracy of anyone feeling only one emotion at a time, everything about this movie was casually ableist. The portrayal of depression as being something small and easily gotten over was incorrect and terrible. Even the advertisements (""Meet the Little Voices Inside Your Head"") felt like an insensitive joke towards people with schizophrenia or other disorders who have auditory hallucinations.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Too depressing and confusing for kids, too boring and literal for adults, this movie is enjoyable by no one. Pixar did not please its intended audience, nor did it please the grown ups. The one redeeming factor was the animation, which was good but all the designs were so uncreative that good animation couldn't save it."

","I went to see this with my 6 year old and 12 year old and we all left depressed and hating the movie. Disney needs to remember they are in the ""entertainment"" business. This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes, there is realism. But, I prefer the ""fantasy"" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them. Am so sad that my kids can't have that same joy! This movie was such a waste of talent and time!!! Save your money and watch a DVD at home instead."

","The film was awful and extremely boring. It was just so depressing and sadness was possibly the most annoying character ever conceived...why why why did she have to keep touching things after she was told over and over not to, just irritating. It got to the point where I was dreading the character coming on the telly. Animated Disney/pixar films should stick to what they are good at and that's making children (and adults) happy. Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but the general overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside another depressing character that I couldn't care less about. Should never have been made, should have saved their money. Im very sad that I can never get back the time I wasted on it...I could have watched paint dry."
"vincentbethany","1","318","692","8 July 2015"," The Cheese Stands Alone
","I simply cannot comprehend why this movie is being heralded as Pixar's finest. It is flawed in so many ways, which is uncharacteristic of Pixar. The concept is wholly unoriginal, which lead me to believe that Pixar would present us with something astounding to compensate, but what they have given us is unimaginative human characters whose personified emotions represent exhausted stereotypes. When we meet the father's emotions, they're lazily watching sports instead of taking an active interest in family dinner time, while the mother's emotions try to resign themselves to the fact that they have settled for a schlub instead of a handsome ex lover. The daughter is presented as the perfect all-American girl and we are never given even a glimpse of her being anything but perfect until the emotions Joy and Sadness find themselves ejected from the control center of her mind. Then suddenly she's the clichéd brat that lazy story telling will have us believe of every tween and teenager. The most unbelievable action of this character comes when this seemingly ideal daughter decides that in order to be happy she should run away from her loving home and travel alone across the country. All the while, mom and dad take this in their stride as though she's always behaved this way. All this, we are shown, is because the only emotions running the show are anger, disgust and fear, since joy and sadness are still trying to return to the control center. By Pixar's logic, we are incapable of rational actions without joy and sadness. Okay, I get that it's a movie, but this is bad writing. At one point we are expected to accept Sadness's antics simply because she claims that she doesn't know why she's doing what she's doing. What!?! If the ones controlling the brain cannot account for their actions, then what is the point of the premise? Perhaps the sequel will show us the emotions inside the heads of the emotions sadness, joy and the rest. Aside from the terrible story line and lack of character depth, the film lacks the usual humor we have come to associate with Pixar, and while Joy and Sadness's quest to get back where they belong is undoubtedly frustrating for them, the constant obstacles they encounter make it almost unbearable to sit through. Mostly, I feel, because again and again they keep getting sooooo close, only to have something happen and they have to find another way, finally making it happen through the use of a stack of imaginary boyfriends. Let me say that again: They finally get back to control by stacking up a bunch of imaginary boyfriends. Yes, I know, it's a movie, and a cartoon at that, but this is Pixar. We have come to expect better. Well, I have, at least. Judging by the other reviews and the box office, Inside Out is a huge hit. I still cannot fathom why. I must be taking crazy pills."
"sweetsmile-90907","1","445","981","14 October 2015"," Pixar, how far you have fallen...because this movie was terrible. Really.
","There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why I find it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when Spirited Away--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6. Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult to like. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and the other emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and find easy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me the wrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that were used and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Riley has an ""imaginary boyfriend"" at the age of 12. I don't know about you people, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls should NOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while it may start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexual thoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous at their age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself) who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don't even get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG! That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly, disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVE this movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, on the whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixar movies. It was compared to ""UP"" for Pete's sake--the movie that had EVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let- down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me to build it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watch at your own peril. Consider yourself warned."
"italianredneckgirl","1","295","640","29 June 2015"," Inside Out, Upside Down
","I have never entered in such a poor review for a Disney film. I am always defending the ""Imagineers"" and their creative processes. I'm a Floridian..not a true Florida cracker, more of a saltine (or maybe a Triscuit). But, my love for all things Disney ended with Inside Out. <br/><br/>The premise was really great, in concept, but extremely poorly enacted. So, yeah, OK, you've got your emotions, ""Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, etc...."" Yeah, it's that bad. An etc. Do I really need to say more? <br/><br/>Well, of course, there's more. Riley is THE perfect girl. But really, what she is, is sheltered. A good family. Parents that worship her. A core group of friends and education, extracurricular activities, etc. <br/><br/>Yeah, another etc. <br/><br/>Societal norms and morés dictate that this is really not the case. Having both parents, let alone both parents being married, is an event these days. Sure, we'd all love to believe that those idyllic family structures still exist. But, truly, ask your children, it isn't even close. <br/><br/>So, let's go ahead and move this ""perfect"" family, because of Dad's job (yeah, cuz that's an original storyline) and plunk em down in Cali from Minnesota. Disney/Pixar's attempts to poke fun at Vegan lifestyles to get the viewer closer to the family is pretty weak. As is the whole system of forming and processing memories. <br/><br/>Leading us all to believe that joy is the most powerful and important emotion. When, in the end, sadness rules the roost. Ummmm, what? <br/><br/>All ""core memories"" are formed by sadness and touched by joy. Please. <br/><br/>The disconnect between the emotions and the girl is huge. Watching a movie that is supposed to be happening inside this girl is confusing. Riley's actions are so delayed that is clear that we're all watching minutes of dialogue before she reacts. It's distracting. Not to mention pretty lame. <br/><br/>It seems Disney/Pixar kinda realized this and decided to showcase Riley's emotions while she was asleep. Believable. Mmhhmm. Yeah, ummmm, no. <br/><br/>Throw in a couple of distracted parents and stress, not even real stress, a kind of implied stress, and they're you have the whole basis of the film. Pretty shaky. <br/><br/>I saw this film with an 11 and 12 year old. Both girls Riley's age. Now, granted, these girls have great families...but they also have mothers going through terminal illness and fathers that work their trails off to make ends meet. So their emotions run high. But they aren't cry prone girls. And yet, here we were, popcorn, candy, sodas for breakfast watching this horrible film. Both girls in tears and a very well placed f-bomb by yours truly to lighten the mood. <br/><br/>Bottom line? 90 minutes of confusing, sad, disjointed dialogue and about 5 minutes of happy. Never a laugh out loud. Maybe a smile. Maybe. <br/><br/>So, ummmm, what the hell Disney/Pixar? This the trend? If so, take me back to it being a small small world. It's way better than drilling these fake boyfriend thoughts of being our savior into our daughter's head. First were waiting for ""our price to come."" Now we're relying on fake boyfriends? Please. <br/><br/>How about a girl that can handle herself, her school, her family, and be strong? Not this lame nonsense."

","Well I went to see this movie last night with a friend and I think for children under 10 the movie is to complex. The main human emotions were very original but the movie never got me in. The story was also not that good. I would not take my daughter to the movie and it is that my friend liked it, otherwise I would not even have finished it. I think this is not what we are used to from Pixar. All the other Pixar movies were watchable for adults and children but to be honest I thought it was pretty awful.

"PipAndSqueak","1","287","622","27 July 2015"," Misery on a stick
","OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads."

","Yes, my mind is blown away by this movie not because it's spectacular  as it was hailed by many critics but because this movie is super lame  for a studio that has never released a bad movie (edit: i have  forgotten about brave and cars 2 i guess pixar has lost their touch and  that's why they made finding dory)  CGI wise this movie has an outstanding work like usual but the real  problem is the story. The first 1 hour of the movie i was waiting for  the main problem that would be the objective of the story but i was  actually watching it this whole time and watching it through the end i  just felt nothing and said ""is that it? what the heck?"".   The climax/ending was very weak it was somehow really flat probably  because the main obstacle itself was rather stupid.  The movie environment seemed very dull and narrow especially for the  imaginary part of the mind. The special 5 mind characters are annoying  and predictable. The jokes and dialogs are not memorable.  I don't know what kind of drugs these good reviewers are using but this  is the worst Disney PIXAR movie yet, it's so bad that i decided to  write my first review for this abomination of an animation.  I would give this 5/10, but with the misleading score such as 8.4, i  feel there is an obligation to demote it down hence the 1/10.  For those who thinks this is a hate/bandwagon/troll attempt. no this is  solely what i feel about this movie and it's a shame that people are so  against bad reviews.

"Rstein926","1","414","911","10 January 2016"," One of the worst and boring Disney films period!
","I have not seen every Disney Pixar film. The ones I have watched are the Toy Story films, Monsters Inc and it's sequel Monster University, a Bugs Life, Cars, Finding Nemo & The Incredibles. The ones I have not seen are Wall-e, Ratouttlie, Brave, Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur. Most of the ones I seen were either great or not bad. My favourite Disney film is the Lion King followed by the Jungle Book (1967) and Pinocchio. But this film is one of the worst and boring Disney films I have ever seen!<br/><br/>The film is about a little girl named Riley who moves to a new home in San Franscisco after her dad gets a new job and her mind is controlled by a group of creatures known as 'emotions' who get her through everyday life but two of them Joy and Sadness end up in the bowls of Riley's mind where old memories are stored and without them especially Joy Riley's life is misery at home and school.<br/><br/>This film was just awful. This film may be family friendly but the film is nothing like a film for children. There is very little comedy and is more adult-themed than the other Pixar films. It is my opinion also that this film shares similarities to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Exorcist and The Land Before Time. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. For example Joy is all happy and optimistic while Sadness is like Eeyore by being downright miserable. Like Regan McNeil of The Exorcist Riley is processed in her mind but by the emotions and not a demon named Pazuzu while her parents and presumably everyone in the film are also processed by emotions. The film's sub plot where Joy and Sadness try to get back to headquarters is a throwback to the Land Before Time where Littlefoot and his friends try to find the Great Valley. <br/><br/>I also felt the film was rushed and none of the characters apart from Riley, Joy and Sadness get much screen time. Even Anger, Fear and Disgust hardly get involved in the film. Disgust arguably was the emotion who got demoted to extra.<br/><br/>The film was as I said rubbish and how people loved this film has left me stumped. To me this film does not deserve a sequel as this film is just not good enough for one."

","In the beginning of 'Inside Out' it seemed like it was going to be a good, fun story.

Then, Joy and Sadness got lost from headquarters and the movie began on it's downward plummet...towards a stressful, unorganized, Hodge-Podge of frustration! They encountered obstacle after obstacle until we were so ready for this movie to be over. It seemed to be annoying for adults and confusing for children. The movie just didn't work, there were not even close the amount of emotions necessary to compare to the complexity of the human mind, and the story of Riley wanting to take a bus back to Minnesota by herself thinking it would make her happy was ridiculous. <br/><br/>Bing Bong, seemed like a very cliché imaginary friend, with nothing special to him to make him a supporting character. Especially if you compare him to other Pixar films supporting roles who we know and love such as Dory and Mike Wasowski. We found Sadness annoying, and every time we heard her talk we just thought of Phyllis Smith's role, Phyllis, in the Office talking. :)Joy was not one of the emotions we had while watching this movie. It dared to live up to the fun filled family films that Pixar has created before, such as Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc., and Ratatouille, but it failed to do so. It was not fun. In all honesty, after watching this movie we thought it to be quite possible this movie was created by a drunk woman during her time of month.

","94 minutes of pure joy and emotion. A return to masterclass from pixar and not only that, probably their best work outside of Toy Story 1 and 2. This film does deserves every bit of praise it has got and more. I will say without hesitation that if you haven't seen this film, believe me you should.<br/><br/>Lets just start easy by saying that the animation is something other-wordily. We are beyond the point where anyone needs to express the fact that pixar's animation is gorgeous, but the fact is this animation is some of the most intelligent and dense animation I have ever seen. There are easter eggs in every single frame and more than that every visual element in the movie is well rounded and clearly thought out which makes the storytelling so much more gripping. Talking about storytelling, rarely does a film do visual storytelling so brilliantly. Five minutes into the movie I was in and I knew how things were rolling. This s really a lesson on how to think things out visually and how to use visuals to your advantage as much as it is possible, combining them to smart, engaging ideas.<br/><br/>And now to the layers the film has. The deepness of its themes, the intelligence of its story, the subtext behind every action and word, the comedic touches, the insanely funny pop culture references, the poetic approach to joy and sadness, the emotional depth, everything, I'm telling you everything here is gut wrenching. There isn't one scene where you feel time is being wasted, there isn't one word a character speaks that doesn't feel genuine, there isn't one idea that is boring or unoriginal. This film is beyond emotionally engaging, this film gives you a mirror on which to reflect your life and think about it, but no wait it doesn't stop there, it also gives you the opportunity to laugh about it, that no matter what is going on there is also space for a laugh and for lightness. Wow.<br/><br/>After a second viewing I have settled on the problem I originally had and can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues, it's truly a great one and definitely the best we've been given in 2015 so far. After my first viewing I was all enthusiastic about everything above, but I also was left a little confused by the mythology the film uses and wasn't quite sure it always fit. Upon a second viewing I guarantee that there is no such problem. The mythology is perfect and works with a solid and thought out logic that takes into account the chaos of life. What doesn't quite work is the fact that the film does have a few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out and I honestly wanted a little bit more of the control center room scenes and see some more of how it worked there, but then again I am really nitpicking.<br/><br/>Incredible for me to say it, but I really want a sequel to this film, it's incredible. I want to see another two hours of the five emotions battling in out in the life of Riley and her further struggles, especially want to see the teenage years. This idea is truly amazing and special and it is so inspiring to me, I just really want a sequel to this film and that's the first time I've ever said that in my life.<br/><br/>Trust me this film deserves every single bit of your attention and heart, it will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions and entertainment that is absolutely delightful and will also leave you thinking for days."

Today it is going back to the video store and my kids will not be watching it until they have taken psychology 101 and can weigh its value-driven abstractions from the distance of understanding, rather than with the emotionally-infused closeness of self-identification.<br/><br/>A relative tried defending the movie to me by pointing out the theme is about compassion, and that there is nothing ""wrong"" with sadness. In as sense, this boils down to the old time-worn phrase ""it's OK to cry"". But nowhere does crying or sadness in this movie play the role of a release. In contrast to Anger, who builds up and explodes like a pressure cooker, sadness doesn't overflow like a bathtub or even crumble like a dam... sadness in this film lurks like a fat, nerdy misfit, subverts happiness every chance she gets, taints memories, and ultimately serves no purpose in terms of emotionally righting the ship other than drawing in sympathy and attention from ""nice people"".<br/><br/>This view of human psychology has the typical but subtle anti-male bias. Mom's head, apparently with sadness front and center, is able to marshal measured responses of empathy, while dad's head is filled with one-dimensional mustachios bullied by anger, whose raison d'etre is ostensibly to man-up watching contact sports and to issue knee-jerk ""go to your room"" manifestos. I mean I understand it would be too much for a society that over-obsessed with being nice to explore in film the role that aggression plays in developing self-esteem from a healthy 11-year-old boy's perspective, but seriously? Instead, we get a highly inaccurate generalization that the journey from childhood to adolescence is accompanied by a melancholy shift in perspective based on the loss of childhood innocence. That may be part of the maturing process, but it certainly isn't the equilibrium most people operate under.<br/><br/>No, the portrayal of sadness in this film is not the sadness of mourning and loss that people learn to compartmentalize when they have, for example, lost a best friend. It is the portrayal of an unchecked festering sadness. Attempts by joy to compartmentalize sadness are portrayed in this film as childish, insensitive, counterproductive, and even foolish. In an 11 year old, this kind of emergent sadness smacks of precursors to teen depression. Yes, believe it or not, the current standard of psychiatry in the US is to diagnose children as young this protagonist with depression and get out the prescription pad and the Prozac.<br/><br/>As the theme of the film acknowledges, sadness is interpreted as a call out for help. But with psychotherapy on the wane, for a happy child who suddenly exhibits lingering sadness, a trip to a doctor is going to end with meds being prescribed. And as far as the film's solution - not only do none but the most emotionally supported of children always get the ""shoulder to cry on"" or sympathetic ear to talk to then need, but, frankly, it's not always as simple as mom or dad doling out hugs or providing time to listen. As one parody mocked, this film parades around a thinly veiled case of a child experiencing schizophrenic and bipolar episodes. You can't cure that with hugs, home-brew psychotherapy and a feel good ending.<br/><br/>In the end, I would view this film as totally inappropriate for children who are old enough to ""appreciate"" the message of the film and to empathize with the emotions of the protagonist. For most children under 4, this film will be nothing more than another light and color show of funny characters doing silly things. For adults, it may be a key that can turn on those restrained tear-ducts for a few moments of satisfying catharsis. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I strongly discourage this film for school age children, especially girls in the 10 - 16 year old range (but really any child whose life has been affected by a pronounced source of sadness - e.g., loss of a parent or someone close, becoming homeless, loss of a pet, etc.)<br/><br/>As a didactic device reminding parents to hug their children when they are sad, the film is OK. For children who feel tinges of sadness as they transition out of childhood to adolescence, the film may achieve the goal of explaining that these feelings are normal. But at the same time the film undermines the healthy process by which those transient feelings are brought into check with new touchstones of identity filled with joy that involve creation of happy memories as tween-teen's in whatever changed circumstance they find themselves. And as a vehicle for the validation of pronounced, enduring sadness in tween-teens, the film is downright misleading and inaccurate. The child who gives in to letting sadness control their life is very likely to end up being labeled ""depressed"", and instead of more hugs and time with mom and dad, what they can expect is a bottle of pills and daily trips to the nurse's office to ingest them."

","All that money spent to make it and the movie misses the most important point entirely! The most important human emotion is LOVE, not the other ones that play key roles in the movie. And it is LOVE, Mr. Pete Docter, not LAVA, but I guess it is pointless to explain what LOVE is to someone who does not put much value on it.<br/><br/>I did not know that children are supposed to scream at parents or throw temper tantrum, or do other crazy things the girl in the movie did when she did not like what her parents did. But according to Pete Docter it is perfectly OK and only natural for a 10 year old to do. Slamming doors in parent's face is OK. Giving them silent treatment is OK, too, according to the directors. But what is really bad, according to the movie, is a healthy veggie pizza!

They are QUITE LITERALLY ONE-DIMENSIONAL.

","A young girl's five emotions try to solve her identity crisis caused by moving, but when the wrong levers in brain's control center are pushed, things go awry. <br/><br/>That synopsis made me push watching this further and further ahead to, but I loved Docter's masterpiece ""Up"" so I had to watch this in a theater while I still could. Me and my partner thought, well, not really expecting much, so it will probably be OK. But oh what a disappointment it was. OK, I admit we are not teens. And love Japanese animation. And I do not appreciate Disney because of their marketing bonanza and ill-fitting gender stereotypes. But this film is so chock-full of fantasy-killing and misguided ideological messages that I am flabbergasted. It is beyond me how so little viewers find offense with the messages, and that these are thoroughly inappropriate for kids. <br/><br/>Like for instance: 1) You are not in control of your emotions, your emotions control you. 2) Thought and reason have no influence at all on your decisions. 3) If you do not keep your emotions in check, you will lose your memories. If you lose your memories, you will become emotionally unresponsive. 4) There is only one good emotion (joy). There are four negative ones (sadness, anger, disgust, fear). That is it. That is what everyone feels. To hell with love. Or desire. Or curiosity. Or faith. 5) In order to grow up, your joyful memories have to become sad memories. Why? Good question. That is the climax of the movie and there is no explanation why this should be the case.<br/><br/>None of this makes any sense. The whole plot is completely incoherent. These messages hold no educational value whatsoever. And strangely this seems to be more obvious to children than to adults - I heard a boy asking his parents what any of that was supposed to mean. <br/><br/>This is obviously made and marketed for tech-savvy young parents who think they should take their kids to something more ""challenging"" than ""Planes 2"". The parents look like what an ad exec at Disney imagines Google employees to look like - mom wears cute specs, dad a hipster beard and it is set in San Francisco on top of that. The whole thing is probably the most in-your-face marketing device posing for a movie that I have ever seen. And everybody seems to be literally buying it.<br/><br/>Well, not everybody. Some of the reviewers here do have similar issues, so all is not lost for the human race. If you care for an alternative story about a girl away from home struggling to adapt, there is the fantastic new Ghibli feature ""When Marnie was there"".

The animation is super-busy as is the dialogue. It's fun to hear the voices of a superstar cast, and some of the ideas are very insightful.

But the story amounted to what appeared to be a high end PBS type educational public service announcement about getting to know the workings of the mind and emotions but in the most micromanaged, compartmentalized, explain the obvious so much it distracts from the real story and that being a bit sappy and contrived one at best.

"SquigglyCrunch","6","182","393","20 September 2015"," An Interesting Concept with a Handful of Inconsistencies
","Inside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. It's an interesting concept, and for the most part it's presented well, but there are flaws for sure. <br/><br/>The plot is, like I already said, interesting but flawed. It bothers me that people are saying that this is an incredibly original concept despite the fact that it's been done before. It's just the most popular use of the idea, but it's not the original. The story itself, however, has a handful of really good ideas, but there are inconsistencies with it too. The disappointing part is that most of the inconsistencies are actually pointless scenes that don't add to the story but instead end up taking away from it. There aren't a lot of them, but there's enough to take away from the movie itself. Most of the inconsistencies would spoil the movie, so you'll just have to watch it to understand. Other than that the ideas are good and some are even pretty amusing. <br/><br/>The characters are okay. I found the most interesting characters to be the parents personally, with Riley being as flat as a pancake and everyone else just not being important enough to even remember by the time the credits roll. For a movie about emotion, Riley really isn't presented in a very realistic way. Sure, at times she's good, but most of the time her character is just inconsistent. The parents were, on the other hand, much more consistent, and funnier most of the time. <br/><br/>I think that this movie had a great beginning and a great ending, it was just the middle stuff that struggled. It's a very emotionally intense movie, especially towards the end. I felt much more into the movie at these points, and even on my third watch I got a bit emotional about the ending. The movie felt a little too short as well, but maybe that's because I've seen it so many times already. <br/><br/>Overall Inside Out is just good. I think that I loved it so much originally (I gave it a 10/10) because of the ending. It was pretty emotional the first time, but after the second watch I started to question it. By the third watch I found inconsistencies and a handful of things that I just didn't like about the movie. Ideas and such that just weren't nearly as good as I remember. In the end I'd still certainly recommend this movie, but if you want to really love it then don't analyze it, because otherwise you'll notice the things that I did (probably)."

Because honestly, there'd be nothing better than taking your kid to see a movie that makes them think about how they work. Bright colourful visuals, lovable animals inside our head in a big mind world. It could have been so cool. However, this movie has NONE of that. It makes your inside of your head look like a stupid office worker's counter, what gives?<br/><br/>If this were done in the 90s, we would have had a HUGEEEEEE story about jaguars and cheetahs and fish and stuff in our mind. Showing kids just how BIG you are inside, and how your gears that operate you are big things. Not some boring set of plastic characters. Plastic referring to the term from Mean Girls (it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, see it if you don't know the term ""plastic""). The emotions all look like plastics, especially Joy. There's a way to 3D model a character in a movie to have a proper kid movie physique. Joy looks like a plastic anorexic. What with all the slang and annoying sarcasm bratty attitudes too. You want your kids seeing that? Back then in a Bug's Life, our kids got to see Princess Atta having a normal girl's figure, Dot her little sister actually had kiddy cheeks, this main girl character in Inside Out is a PLASTIC. PLASTIC I TELL YOU.<br/><br/>She gets into the biggest plastic arguments with her parents, I never did that nonsense and no one from the 90s did that stuff. Typical mean kid with a cell phone. The day animated movies FROM PIXAR FOR GOD'S SAKE, have the main character being like 12 with a cell phone? Cell phone when you're under 30 would have been bad back in the 90s. Heck I think even at my age you can't have a cell phone without your mother poking fun at you.<br/><br/>This ties back to another point, that animated movies now are using humans as the characters. Why? What did animals ever do to you? Clearly these movie makers now are not from that era when we had beautiful characters like Mufasa, Woody, Sully, Hopper, etc. Where are the villains in this movie? Where's the Kevin Spacey acting? Where's Scar? No one cool? Just some miniskirt plastic punching the dinner table and upsetting her parents? I never did that stuff. Humans as main characters in animated movies DO NOT usually make good film material.<br/><br/>Not to mention the whole movie was ridden with high school references, typical plastic stuff. It was so boring I luckily was there when it was on at home, I could just leave the room while the other's watched. Never show this to your kids. It makes them think their world is microscopic and its ran by desk clerks. The ""emotion"" characters really aren't funny or likable, they are NOT cute like Dot from a Bug's Life or Boo from Monsters Inc, they SUCK. And the whole ""I'm a teen so I don't talk to my parents"" thing was forbidden before. Now it's the main subject of the movie? Makes you wonder what this movie maker looks like who made the movie. What the heck are they? Hoodlums? I don't know.<br/><br/>You makers need to take a pen and jot down full essays about what makes Lion King so good, Scar so menacing. Kovu from the second Lion King so cool, what makes Heimlick funny from a Bug's Life, what makes Zee a hero from Antz, the list goes on. Such a boring offensive movie.

","The trailer was so misleading. It portrayed the film as funny, but this film is anything but. <br/><br/>It starts off where 11 year old Riley moves from Minnesota to California which she is unhappy about. She gets to the gloomy grey house in a gloomy grey street and you feel her depression and disappointment. It was California but there was no sunshine to speak of. You wouldn't expect this kind of bleakness in a film aimed at young people let alone children. <br/><br/>The film barely gave Riley any screen time and spent most of the time on emotions Joy and Sadness, who were both trapped outside brain headquarters and trying to get back. Sadness has to be the most annoying, unlike-able character. On the way they meet Bing Bong, Riley's old imaginary elephant friend. Seeing him cry because he's sad Riley no longer plays with him made me cry, but it gets worse, when he and Joy get trapped in a dump and both try to escape, they can't get out together because he's to heavy,so he let's her go alone, she looks back to see him disappearing into thin air while saying ""take Riley to the moon for me"". This was a Bambi sad moment. We never get reunited with Bing Bong and never see or hear from him again, this is such a downer, he was innocent,helpful and likable.<br/><br/>There was one scene where Riley introduces herself to her new classmates and then bursts into tears because she didn't want to be there, I couldn't help but think this was an overreaction. Since Joy and Sadness were no longer in her mind she's only left with Disgust,Anger and Fear (these characters had nowhere near enough screen time and were much more entertaining than Joy and Sadness). She decides to steal money from her mother and run away back to Minnesota, but as soon as she's on the bus, Sadness and Joy have made it back to headquarters and Joy orders Sadness to do her work. Riley suddenly feels sadness and realising she'll miss her family changes her mind and runs back home. As soon as she sees her parents she starts crying and says she doesn't like living here. Her parents comfort her and the film ends there.<br/><br/>So the moral of the story is its okay to cry and that all our emotions are important,even the bad ones. If Riley didn't feel sadness she would have never seen sense and went ahead with her stupid plan and probably end up being raped and murdered.<br/><br/>Once the film is over you don't feel happy, nothing good really happened it was just wall to wall misery. Bing Bongs death, Riley being isolated from her parents, ditching her hobbies, losing her two important emotions, losing her old friends, hating her new house, eating lunch alone at her new school and running away. This is a Disney film right? Talk about putting bad ideas in children heads. After the film was over I felt sad for the rest of the day and night. I wish I never watched this."

","I am sitting here watching this animated nightmare with my niece who seems to like the movie. I asked her; ""Is that it?...is that all the emotions they are presenting to you? Where is wisdom? Where is faith?"" The film is disturbing as it presents no magic to being a kid. It seems to play a lot on getting down in this world and reacting with anger and fear. Joy tries to rescue the mind but is being manipulated by outside forces trying to be goofy but lost in deception. I am not sure what this film is trying to suggest. I recall as a kid I use to have two characters in my head, little aliens, one good and one bad. They would do battle but good would win out each time. Yet, the little manipulative one would sometimes disguise himself as good. Yet, wisdom would come into play and I would send both aliens out of my head. Is Disney being operated by a cult?

"thegreatbelly","2","77","159","17 February 2016"," Yay Depression!...
","It seems like the message that the writers of ""Inside Out"" were trying to pass on to its audience (adults and children alike) was ""It's OK to feel sad when traumatic events happen in your life."" But instead, it came across more as ""Feeling optimistic and trying to be happy in the face of adversity isn't realistic and is actually harmful to your mental well-being, Sadness is IMPORTANT and you have to let your Sadness run free when bad things happen."" <br/><br/>The core concept of the movie-- personifying the emotions that drive us-- is an interesting one, but they run into a major problem. By personifying an emotion like Sadness, you take something that is a tragically everyday part of life, and turn it into a cute green lump with her own personality and emotions. So instead of being an abstract concept that really sucks to experience, Sadness is now somebody you have to root for and cheer on. So when the climax of the movie hits, the film-makers are trying to get you to cheer Sadness on. Go Sadness, we're on your side, feel important and save the day! Meanwhile, Riley, the actual girl, has Sadness take over her mind, corrupting her happy memories that shape her entire personality, and realistically the experience would leave the girl with depression that she has to spend the rest of her life treating. But hey, that green blob get's to feel special for a while, so it's all good, right? Hurrah, kid's movie! <br/><br/>Inside Out does have plenty of funny moments, and a solid voice cast, but it is ultimately majorly dragged down by both a script that tries to be deep and insightful but completely bungles the execution, and a story that feels artificially drawn out, making the hour-and-a-half run-time drag at times, making the movie possibly Pixar's worst (though to be fair, I haven't seen either of the Cars movies yet)."

I tried to think that perhaps the character was bossy and pushy to show that happiness always tries to prevail but I just wanted the character to die in that pit of forgetfulness.<br/><br/>And that's the best story the filmmakers could come up with? It's like they've run out of imagination! Maybe Pixar's problem is being part of Disney, which can churn out cookie-cutter movie after formulaic movie. I mean, you've got some of the best talent in the world and mountains of money, and yet you can't come up with a friggin' decent story! <br/><br/>For this movie, the makers could have made ANYTHING happen in the brain, which is in itself an endless container of possibilities, and yet they chose to have the two main emotions wander around lost in memory storage for most of the movie. Perhaps Imagination Land in the movie represents the imagination of the filmmakers: it's puny and boring - French fries, a house of cards, an imaginary boyfriend. The place looked like some desolate Vegas amusement park about to be shut down. It was depressing.<br/><br/>Then we start to see the parents' emotions but only a few times. You either do that consistently or you don't do it at all. And it seems adults would have more emotions than children. Anyway, it doesn't seem to make a difference.

A small group. The Bay Area is full and largely unaffordable (and unaccommodating) to incoming families. Most especially to those not receiving a pair of high tech incomes.

"Theraxorterminate","8","94","199","25 September 2015"," Once again another beautiful animated movie gets such undeserved hatred.
","(WARNING THERE COULD BE SOME BRIEF SPOILERS!)<br/><br/>Okay seriously you guys what has been going on with IMDb lately? Has it been hacked for real? Or is there some sort of ""Hate-group of Movies"" that helps the negative reviews to be read just so we won't watch this movie? Before I was able to see this movie I refused to read any reviews here especially the negatives. And I can honestly say that I am extremely baffled to see how many negative reviews around here is on the top of usefulness! Was this movie seriously that bad? Is this really PIXAR's worst movie out there? And my answer to that is simply: No not at all! And I will tell why this isn't a bad movie.<br/><br/>Now I don't want any rant here as much as everyone else don't and I know most people hate ""defenders"" of certain movies but you know what I might as well be going to perform both of those things right now just so you get the idea why ""Inside Out"" isn't a bad movie.<br/><br/>First I do have a question to those who didn't like this movie: Have you totally forgotten how good a PIXAR movie usually presents? Yes I know it's been a long time since we had a remotely good Pixar movie, I wasn't impressed of Cars 2 and I despised Brave too (and I still think today it's an awful movie that didn't deserve its Oscar) although I didn't dislike Monsters University as much everyone else did but true it could have been better. And now 2 years without a Pixar movie we finally got to see their next feature ""Inside Out"" and I can honestly tell everyone that this is not only the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 it's also their most ""personal"" movie so far.<br/><br/>Now as much as I love watching Disney movies from WDAS I still love watching Pixar movies for their own unique presentations. Ever since ""Ratatouille"" they've had such unique ways for presenting unusual storytelling with the characters and the stories but still manage to be beautiful, likable and well-crafted without even messing up with annoying corny humor that ruins the important moments. And for a long time it finally got that craft after watching this movie and it also returned my love for Pixar again.<br/><br/>Now I do not want to go with deeper details about the characters since I think now most know how these characters was presented, but if I'd like to talk about something a little different I would love to ask again to those who didn't like the film about the ""perfect"" girl Riley. Could you at least describe what's so ""perfect"" about Riley. And what did you else expect? A poor or rich girl? Or a stereotype? Riley's a fine character and I was happy to see how Pixar managed to create their own girl without ever putting in stereotypical appearances for her and that's a plus. She isn't extremely girly or a spoiled brat either and to me she's one of the most original characters Pixar have created. Though I do wished we could have gotten a little more screen time with her.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the message but it is another big thing Pixar has given us this year. And I can tell that I was really worried if there ever were going to be a ""good"" message in this movie, and yet it does. I honestly can't see what makes it ""too dark"" for the children to understand it and as I said before this really is PIXAR's most personal movie so far and I'm not lying about this, I felt how a little tear from me wanted to get out when the movie was almost over. I think this year could be their most important message they've delivered us and I am very thankful to Pixar for showing us that. Oh and also the humor in the movie, did I tell you how enjoyable the humor in the movie was? I almost couldn't breathe in some parts and yes it was that funny it had a good balance of their usual Pixar humor with some very witty small jokes that appeared at times. Comedy movies have really disappointed me for the past years but I really had a great time with ""Inside Out"" I'd even dare to say this movie is even funnier than most newer comedy movies.<br/><br/>One last but not least thing to say: I really had a good time watching Inside Out and the audience loved it too and at the very end of the movie (it's not always this usual for my home country and this was no exception) everyone applauded and so did I and I frankly believe it deserves the credit it receives. And I'm just going to go ahead and say that I think it should be about time that an animated movie should win for Best Picture next year. No I'm 100% serious about this and I wouldn't be surprised at all it would make me very proud of the Oscars to pick this one as the winner. And hopefully can finally change the minds of millions of people who still believes that animated movies are just for children, and hopefully it ends soon when they see Inside Out."

"lbishopkyo","1","44","87","20 May 2018"," I seriously hate this movie soooooo much...
","You ever watch a movie trailer and you can just tell you're going to hate it? That was this film. When it came out, I knew that I should stay away. Then a few months ago, as part of a project, my teacher had the class and I watch this film because we were learning about perspective-taking or something like that. Within the first five minutes, I knew that it wasn't going to get any better. The first 10 minutes are 85% crying and just people being annoying. <br/><br/>That brings me to the first major flaw with this movie: the characters. I hate Riley SO MUCH! She gets sad all the time, but for no good reason...ever. In fact, the first 10-15 minutes of this film are just her crying and being a baby over little things. I wanted to kill myself the longer this went on. I get that we all get sad sometimes, but she gets more upset than any other human being I know, and it happens so spontaneously you have no reason to feel for her. Frankly, I don't know which character I hate more; it's either her or Sadness, who, let me tell you, every second she was onscreen, I wanted to punch her in the face. She spends the entire movie whining and being all angst-ridden and complaining. I get that that's her persona, but it's not done right. Jimmy Neutron did a sad character way better, and they made it funny! This movie's Sadness isn't funny in the slightest. And when everything is said and done, you realize that everything that happens in this movie is basically her fault because tinkers with what she shouldn't. To make matters worse, she never listens to Joy when she tells her DON'T TOUCH THOSE HAPPY MEMORIES. How stupid is this emotion? If I had to make a ""worst characters of all time"" list, she'd be on there with Riley.<br/><br/>Oh, and the jokes. Not once did I laugh during this atrocity. I never laughed or even chuckled. The jokes were altogether predictable, boring, and kindergarten-level. Why is it that the non-funny movies are considered to the be the funniest, and the movies that actually ARE funny are the ones left in the dust? This movie's jokes were so bad, they are on par with The Emoji Movie's jokes. Yes. I said that. I actually compared Inside Out to the Emoji Movie. I'd much rather watch that than this. Never has a movie made me want to kill myself, and thankfully I haven't yet, because, it is just a movie. But I still really hate it. This is part of my Top 3 worst movies I've ever seen in my life; it's worse than Ghost Rider 2, worse than Sharknado 3, worst than Toy Story 3, worse than the Clash of the Titans remake and worse than Kubo and the Two Strings.<br/><br/>So if you have a very small patience-span, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.

"rebeccadew-85920","2","31","59","1 June 2017"," Confused Emotions, Inside Out
","Call me late to the draw, but this two-year-old film Inside Out has me more upset than its preteen protagonist, Riley.<br/><br/>Why was Riley upset? Why am I upset?<br/><br/>All of Riley's emotions are purely reactive. They are simply responses to external stimuli, not the least of which are the emotions of her parents. This misplaced emphasis on externals is surprising, given the professed aim of the film: to look at human experience from the inside out.<br/><br/>""There's absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now,"" states one emotion mater-of-factly to another.<br/><br/>Every experience may be an opportunity for either joy or sadness. But the film makes it look as if we are controlled by emotions, and it is circumstances which control us through our emotional responses to them.<br/><br/>Problem with the film: the film conflates joy with happiness and joy with love. These are not the same thing.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film: even memories are cast as amenable to reordering, disposal and forgottenness.<br/><br/>Our core memories shape our realities, which are presented as simply a reflection of our perceptions accumulated and understood over time. Our personalities are shaped by memories which influence our response to what we perceive as or experiences day-to-day. When Joy and Sadness go missing, everything goes haywire. <br/><br/>Personality ""Islands"" are depicted as unstable; they shake and fall and crash to the ground. Imaginary friends like the elephant-teddy-bear Bing Bong are depicted as ridiculous and incredible.<br/><br/>Abstract thought is depicted as imaginary (!!). (So much for the history of human experience, culture and civilization . . .)<br/><br/>Ultimately, experiences are depicted as meaningless as soon as they are forgotten.<br/><br/>**SPOILER ALERT** Riley, through no fault of her own, is driven to react with anger and run away from home.<br/><br/>The entirety of her personality is depicted as responsive and reactive—responsive to the emotions with which she is presented and reactive to the circumstances which she encounters. <br/><br/>The idea is that giving Joy an inordinate place is unreality. All emotions are important and therefore to be valued and given an airing.<br/><br/>In the end, Sadness DOES have a purpose. She helps Riley (and us) process life.<br/><br/>There IS a moral to the story. Rather than trying to ""fix"" emotions, we should accept them and process them as they present themselves to us. (Perhaps this is why the tireless Joy is presented as a bit of an egocentric.)<br/><br/>But if all emotions are equally valuable, why give priority to Joy? And if Joy is not given priority, we are opening ourselves up to a very Sad, Fearful, Angry and Disgusted alternate universe.<br/><br/>Perhaps that encapsulates my feelings on the matter. Angry and Disgusted.<br/><br/>When the plot resolves, **SPOILER ALERT** it is only by coming to terms with the grief over her childhood hockey disappointments and her imaginary friend Bing Bong's sacrifice through Sadness that Riley's redemption and Joy's return to the Control Center of the brain are made possible. Sadness has a part to play, after all. <br/><br/>I do admit that it's okay to feel. I do think that childhood memories play an important part in the formation of personality. And I do value the role of Sadness in the processing of these and other emotions. But I feel less Joy than Anger, less Sadness than Disgust as this film draws to a close. <br/><br/>The assumption of the movie that troubles me the most is that emotions are presented as the primary processors of reality. Emotions are all there is. Imagination is nonsensical and problematic. There is no soul beyond the emotions—no reason to speak of. I do appreciate the film for its playfulness, creativity and colour. As a spectacle, it is appealing though not spectacular. And I do like the repetitive running joke about TripleDent gum . . .<br/><br/>But this is not a children's movie, not the adventure reel of delightful music and happy endings we have come to know and love. Only Sadness can bring Riley back to feeling. And therein lies a major flaw in the central message of the film—it is on the centrality of circumstance, not emotions, that our final focus is placed. The film ends convincing us less of the validity of emotions than of the pressures of circumstance. Joy does not win; Sadness does. <br/><br/>In this sense the film is not a comedy.<br/><br/>Nor is it an accurate representation of reality, inside or out."

My daughter left the movie crying and cried several times during the film, it was much to heavy and sad for young kids. <br/><br/>What ever happened to happy kids movies that made us laugh and smile?<br/><br/>Dealing with depression in Big Hero 6 and now this, my kids don't need to learn about or try to understand these heavy subject lines.<br/><br/>I am also a big Pixar fan and as an adult there was no real storey line and none of the usual adult humour thrown in to keep it interesting for everyone. Although this was disappointing it was outweighed by the depressing overall feeling to the entire movie and the fact that I was either explaining to my kids what was happening or consoling them from crying. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see Minions at least we should get some smiles out of that. I'm tired of leaving the movie theatre feeling worse than when we went in."
"FW_MovieFan","1","200","451","24 June 2015"," Worst Pixar Movie Ever!
","I just got home from seeing Inside Out with my wife. We both thought it was the absolute worst movie Pixar has ever done.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Pixar's movies - they've done so many that are so astoundingly good, it's hard to say which one is the best. This movie, on the other hand, easily qualifies as their worst ever. No charm, no humor, no engaging, memorable characters. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to become what other Pixar movies have had - at least some humor or charm or something compelling to keep you watching. It had none of these things. It was a sad, depressing, boring, lackluster affair from start to finish. I'm truly amazed that so many people have found this to be one of Pixar's best efforts. It doesn't even come close to the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life or my favorite, Finding Nemo. On a scale of 1 to 10, IMHO, Inside Out isn't even on the scale.<br/><br/>If you're thinking about going to see it, don't waste your money! A truly awful effort from a company that has set the bar incredibly high and failed, miserably, to live up to that bar.<br/><br/>Hugely disappointing."
"tommyhawka","1","181","407","15 June 2015"," Unique in a terrible way.
","Inside out shows the struggles of a child moving house. It tells to never loose hope. Now you may think this is a very simple story and good but it's more complicated than you think. Most of the movie is about these two characters joy and sadness trying to get back into the kids brain. Literally. This movie is way too complicated for what it is and it could have been really simple. Actually, I think they could have made the movie better without the cartoon characters: joy, sadness, angry, and whatever the rest are. Oh and also this movie is no fun at all. There are no laughs until the credits and I don't think kids would really like this at all. They were laughing tonnes when the minions trailer came on before the movie and when I came out of the movie all I saw was kids crying. I would really think twice before seeing this one. Congratulations Disney you have ruined another movie that could have been great. What happened to the times when you made Finding Nemo, The incredibles."

","I will admit I was done after about an hour and walked out, not even caring enough to get a comp ticket for another film.<br/><br/>Is a movie that dwells on looking inside of yourself to find more of yourself what society really needs right now? Aren't we all a little too self-absorbed and a little too much of a production as it is? I don't get the premise, but whatever, if it is funny it is funny... but it isn't funny or cute or quality. <br/><br/>Amy Poehler is a bully dressed in pleasantries (as is becoming her typecast), the rest of the cast was much better but the writing was stiff and felt like a bad skit from SNL, the laughs are forced and you really don't care about much other than when it will be done. It tries to be smart and deep but sounds like that person you know who loves to recite facts and news without much else, and you find yourself with the blank half-smile stare you reserve for when JWs are at your door and you forgot to pretend you aren't home.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love animated film done right, I was impressed by ""Wreck It Ralph"" and ""Up"" where the voice acting along with the story and writing fit perfectly, this is nothing near those films. If you find ""Tom and Jerry"" type antics as the pinnacle of animated film, this is the film for you, if you are looking for something both with a strong story and characters and voices to match, skip it and don't believe the high rating."

"nick-sultana","10","69","147","21 June 2015"," Ladies and Gentlemen, 2015's Best Animated Film
","Disney & Pixar have made some worthy films that have become well known to audiences of all ages, but the last few releases haven't reached to the quality and standards they had established (in which the last great film they had made is both Up and Toy Story 3). With their latest offering, it is safe and proud to say that Inside Out establishes them back in the game of quality storytelling, animation and heart its concept.<br/><br/>Inside Out explores the mind of a young girl, in her mind we are introduced to the emotions of Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear. They have the roles of controlling emotions that they see through Riley's point of view via headquarters, deciding how she reacts to them (for instance; if Riley was to be happy, Joy would have the controls to do so) and as well they collect 'core memories' that store into the long term memory of Riley in which we are throughout the film shown with moments of happiness, love and set her personality. However, when Riley's family makes a big move to the city it changes the roles of the emotions in Riley in which set off an adventure when Joy and Sadness (an emotion that is often pushed aside) are out What makes this film so well perfect is the mixture of imagination, heart and literally emotion; a concept like this may seem at first impossible to create for the screen but Pixar have come from out and beyond to create an original piece of work that is both open, inspiring and really makes us look in a new way of how our emotions and personal life experiences happen. The animation and use of the right colours for the characters is great and when I mean colour, the emotions themselves have specific colours that represent them as how we understand them. For instance; Joy is yellow, Sadness is blue, Disgust is greens, Fear is purple and Anger of course is red. Each of them has individual personalities that help to establish their roles; Joy is happy, bright and positive that makes Riley seem loved by those around her The emotion that the film carries throughout is further than what Up had already shown us (the well-known and acclaimed 'Married Life' sequence is beyond to what animated films can do to the heart strings), the film makes us personally understand not only the characters on screen but to personally relate to our own life events and personal experiences. The filmmakers have carefully observed on how emotions drive us, in particular Sadness plays a major role in the story that makes us wonder why we can't be sad throughout life but why it's important to be sad when the time comes. In particular, a key moment towards the end of the film pretty much got me and the whole audience (families, couples and even elderly people) in tears and yet understand in our own personal lives the times we get sad. This is a major point that I deeply thought was brought up perfectly and though the much younger kids may not have got it's point but I think from time to time as they grow up they will get the heart of it.<br/><br/>Emotion aside, there are lighter moments when humour is present and gets the audience to laugh out loud. The character Bing Bong (an imaginative figure of Riley's earlier years) gives this best when he pops up in the plot, but as well Anger, Fear and the emotions in other human characters provide such humour and even discovering moments in our minds. The humour works very well in the film and it helps to keep the audience on a brighter side.<br/><br/>Inside Out is not only a triumphant return to quality storytelling for the filmmakers, but it's both original and engaging for audiences to relate to. Bringing a new way to understand human life and our mind capabilities, the film is perfect for children, adults or even anyone young at heart. This is the best animated film for 2015 and it has a very strong chance in becoming Best Picture in the 2016 Oscars.<br/><br/>The animated short 'Lava' that screens before the feature is amazing and different to the comedic shorts from previous years, having more heart and soul and a positive message about love and happiness told through song and colourful animation in detail."

","The film felt like a breath of fresh air, with a plot that used the interesting idea of being inside the 'head' of Riley. Inside Out wasn't exactly I expected to see from what the trailers had shown. A couple of moments had me laugh out loud, and others drove me to tears with emotion. <br/><br/>There wasn't much action in the film compared to many others that Pixar have created, but I was moved in a way that many (shallow) blockbusters haven't done in years. I don't think children will enjoy this film as much as the 21+ audience will, due to the story being one that the ""older"" audience might relate to more."
"RGzer0","3","111","247","7 November 2015"," I felt like I was dying inside
","Well, I did it. I finally watched Inside Out, Pixar's latest masterpiece. After months of waiting for it to be released, and listening to peers rave about how it's Pixar's best film yet, that everybody should see it, and that I will love it, I rented it on iTunes and gave it a watch, despite my reservations.<br/><br/>Now, here's something about me that some people might be able to relate to, and some might not. I can always tell whether or not I will like a movie, or TV show, or book, either based on what I hear about it, or even if it's little more than a gut feeling. It's almost like a sixth sense, which I've only recently come to understand. There's an alarm that goes off in my head that warns me, ""You are not going to like this."" When it goes off like an air raid siren, I know to stay away.<br/><br/>Like I said, I've only recently come to fully understand this, and there have been many times over the years when I've gone ahead anyway despite my misgivings, and ended up wishing I'd trusted said misgivings. I have never been wrong. When I first saw the promotional posters, and learned the plot outline, the inner alarms were blaring loudly and angrily. My instincts have never failed me before.<br/><br/>But, as they say, there is a first time for everything.<br/><br/>And when that time comes, I will be sure to make it known, because that time still has yet to come.<br/><br/>If I had a dime for every time I heard that this movie is Pixar's ""return to form,"" I would probably be set for life. To that assertion, I have a question. Exactly what *form* would that be? The Pixar *I* grew up with made movies that made me *laugh*, that were exciting, and made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. This movie, on the other hand, made me laugh in earnest a grand total of once (""Eat me, I'm organic!""), and kind of chuckle one other time (*snore* ""Who's the birthday girl?""). That's it. The entire rest of the movie, I was wanting desperately to go home, even though I was in my room the whole time.<br/><br/>No Pixar movie has ever made me feel so miserably unhappy, and the 30-second-long happy ending did nothing to make up for the preceding hour and a half of oppressive, and progressively intensifying, gloom. My goodness, that was depressing. I'm not P.O.'d that it made me cry; I actually never cried, although I did come pretty close at the very end, but even if I had, it wasn't in a good way. I have no idea how this movie was supposed to make me feel, but I felt downcast whether that was the intent or not.<br/><br/>If this is Pixar's ""return to form,"" then I'm not sure I want on this ship anymore. This ""form"" started seven years ago with Wall-E, a dreadfully depressing film, continued with Up, about which I listened to my instincts and mercifully skipped (a decision I have never once regretted), and Toy Story 3, which I saw one time and have never watched it since (three guesses why, and the first two don't count). And now Inside Out. Wall-E was a mercy compared to this, and it has barely had time to fully sink in.<br/><br/>I just... I'm dejected. I didn't like it at all. As I said before, I had a very bad feeling from the moment I found out what the movie was about. I put off watching it for almost a week after renting it, just to steel myself for it, even after waiting months for it to come out, and now... I'm not sure anything could have prepared me for this. Frankly, I wish I'd left well enough alone, ignored everybody's raving and pressuring me to see it, and never watched it. I guess one positive is that now nobody can tell me 'don't knock it if you haven't tried it.' I tried it, and it made me miserable. I told you so.<br/><br/>I apologize to any readers if I'm coming off as ranting and railing, but... that was upsetting. I think I'm going to listen to some John Williams to try to cheer myself up.<br/><br/>P.S. Just so nobody misunderstands me, from a purely objective standpoint, this was a marvelously well done film. The animation is beautiful, the voice-acting top notch, and the musical score is lovely. I am not calling any of that into question. This is merely how I experienced the story, and it made me feel like I was dying inside."
"michaelRokeefe","3","103","228","24 June 2015"," Emotions...what are you doing?
","INSIDE OUT is a colorful animated feature that I doubt if Disney and Pixar realize is probably too complex for the viewers they intend to reach. Riley(Kaitlyn Dias)is an 11 year old girl, who is really upset with her mom(Diane Lane)and dad's(Kyle MacLachlan)decision to uproot and move the family to San Francisco. Riley is separated from her friends and is just not so happy with dealing with a new house, school and city. She would rather be back in Minnesota playing hockey.<br/><br/>Most of the film takes place inside Riley's young brain where she must deal with five emotions that dwell in Headquarters; there is Joy(Amy Poehler), Sadness(Phyllis Smith), Anger(Louis Black), Disgust(Mindy Kailing) and Fear(Bill Hader)that jostle to and fro trying to dominate control. Joy tends to be Riley's most important emotion trying to anchor her within a positive attitude.<br/><br/>Other actors lending their voices: Richard Kind, Bobby Moynihan, Dave Goetz, Frank Oz, John Cooley and Paula Pell."

"pix-480-278849","3","104","232","11 October 2015"," Underwhelmed
","Sometimes things are overrated - that is just a fact of life I suppose, but in this case we have a special exception. The over-rate-o-meter is broken and that must be why no one can tell how overrated it is.<br/><br/>Having heard some oozing reviews on the radio and online, with statements like ""return to form for Pixar"" and ""leaving the disappointment of Brave behind"", I was expecting something spectacular. All I can say is... wow.<br/><br/>Brave is several factors of infinity better than this film. Brave has a plot, it has some comedy, it has nice songs and music - it has some characters and the characters have some fire.<br/><br/>In contrast Inside Out relies on one thing and one thing only - anecdotes. Everything hinges on a cheap emotional connection to the various events in life that everyone experiences. The ""actual"" film itself has a weak, scattered and infuriating plot-line pasted together from random sketches. Sadness and Joy are both equally annoying - and theyare the main characters! The characters are all one-dimensional and there are very few of them. There is no memorable music, there are no memorable quotes, the comedy - well there really isn't any to speak of. The only ray of light in the whole thing is the buildup and end to ""put the foot down"" and it isn't mind blowing, it's just a chuckle.<br/><br/>Now, is Frozen overrated? Yes, of course it is, but again at LEAST is has a powerful main song and some interesting characters to merit it's following.<br/><br/>Despite all of the ""glowing"" reviews and comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, I defy anyone to come up with a single quote, a single piece of music, a single character from this film that merits the enthusiasm.<br/><br/>3/10 - and that is being generous"

So I just found the time to watch it for the first time .(I'm months late) , i know....Well truth to be told, the story line is too... readable. Joy being over controlling and sadness is the odd one out which reveals conflicts there , gonna be events, therefore Riley must face certain changes then of course , only natural, Joy realize all emotion must play their role to depth the 'experience' in life . its a readable plot. That what turn me off , there just too much cartoon and animation serve the same idea as this movie.' A little girl undergoing changes and unable to express her emotion properly ' We all went to this kind of phase in real life, the creator just well retell the story we all know. It is not an original idea nor fresh. Sorry. And i believe our conscience is more powerful than our emotion. It just doesn't make sense how emotion are the only thing that dictate what to do.<br/><br/>the movie was okay. I don't hate the movie , its much more like a 50-50 feeling. The feeling that it could have been better. BUT I have to praise the creator for having such creativity in designing how one memories core work and design of the island and everything. The choices of colours vibrant of course , it's a pixar movie. The character are well developed from how Riley was a cheerful child to introvert-kinda child in a very quick time ,and well again its a pixar movie. Expect a good ending out of it. I know its targeted to children but really. We all know the majority of audience is going to be mostly adults, young adults, and children. Basically the story was targeted to 2 audience. The vibrant with crazy design were targeted to attract children while the emotion stuff and the conflict face by Riley are to target adult to well. To relate with her situation.<br/><br/>Its a nice movie(Not really the best pixar movie ever , there other) but hoping there could be a twist there. The values that were set in the movies are already set by other old animation. Sorry for the bad review. Its my first time reviewing.<br/><br/>all I'm saying is. ITS JUST TOO READABLE. People who watch Japanese, western or whatever animation for a long time . You know too well about the plot and value in the 'inside out story'.

It's a shame really cos I saw reviews by parents complaining that this film ain't for kids. I think it's a great conversation piece to have with your kids after the film and explain bits to them about sadness and happiness needing each other etc. There is a strong message there and it sucks that some parents probably more concerned about slating a film rather than exploring the opportunity to engage with their kids about the values in the story etc.<br/><br/>I love this film and i think it's Pixar's best film in years easily one of the top films of all time."

"TheSeaLion","4","107","243","19 June 2015"," Disappointing
","After seeing the trailer for ""Inside Out"", I was pretty keen to see it. The movie looked like it had a lot of good ideas and all of the people working on the project who I knew about I like. This should have been a great movie experience for me, but instead, it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>After moving from Minnesota to San Francisco, eleven-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) has to adjust to a new life with the help of her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). When Joy and Sadness are accidentally purged from the control tower along with Riley's core memories, which make Riley Riley, the two have to find their way back. As Joy and Sadness try to do that, Fear, Anger, and Disgust are the only emotions Riley has left to control her.<br/><br/>In their journeys through Riley's brain back to headquarters, Joy and Sadness come across Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), who helps them find their way through Riley's brain. Bing Bong was not introduced at any point before his reveal, so he just shows up out of nowhere without any buildup or previous mention. Then, he becomes one of the most important characters of the whole movie.<br/><br/>When it comes to the characters, most of them are understandably defined to one personality trait (happy, sad, scared, angry, etc.), but even the characters that aren't emotions don't have much personality to them. Riley has (as stated by the movie) five things that make her who she is, and the only one that really adds any personality is goof ball. Her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) are blank slates, their emotions are blank slates who somehow don't even show their one emotion, and even Bing Bong lacks any real personality. <br/><br/>Along with that, Joy's character arc makes little sense. She learns of Sadness's importance to Riley, but for all we know, Sadness has only done one thing right that helped Riley while Joy and the other three emotions controlling her seemed to be working for the most part. There was no lesson that really needed to be learned from the get-go of the story, because Sadness was only needed to solve the problem that she started in the first place.<br/><br/>The story elements are a lot of the same things over and over again. Joy, Sadness, and Bing Bong try to get to the control center, but each time, their method of getting their is destroyed by the accidentally and unknowingly by an emotion or an exterior event, like Riley sleeping or the brain workers outside of abstract thought. Then, they have to try and find a way to start everything up again or find a new way to Riley's brain. It just goes on like that for an hour and thirty minutes.<br/><br/>Granted, there were some creative elements to the movie and some genuinely funny and emotional moments, but they were overshadowed by the larger problems the movie had. I'd say this is the worst Pixar movie I have seen, even worse than ""Cars"", and a great disappointment."
"mirceamic-316-221061","3","102","231","17 July 2015"," Original idea???
","Before I went to see the movie, I heard (almost) everywhere that this is one of the best movie from Pixar, with an original idea. Hasn't anybody heard about Herman's Head? It's the same concept, but cleverer (in my opinion).<br/><br/>Let's get to this movie:<br/><br/>* my biggest problem is with the introduction of characters (and places); the only characters that have some introduction are the 5 emotions. From the command center everything seems to be automated, without any other help/character, but wait, there are some workers that decide which memory gets kept an which forgotten, other workers that build and maintain Fantasy Land, an imaginary friend that just roams through the memory ... repository, a TV studio (dream makers), a jail, memory eraser ...<br/><br/>* Sadness seems to be such a weak character that doesn't account for her actions, you have to make some connections with Riley's situation in order to (somehow) account for her actions (I still don't see a reason for her actions). It's like she's not in control of her actions. I would say that sadness is, sometimes, a stronger emotion than joy, I never saw that in this movie<br/><br/>* Joy seems to be a strong character. After 12 years of controlling Riley, all of a sudden she looses control to Sadness who, as I said, seems a weak character. * there is a lot of focus on the pit where memories are forgotten ""everything that falls there disappears forever"". Then Joy manages to fall there. Of course she escapes, she's a main character and this is a Disney movie * the islands are lost way to easy, there is no trace of them in the ""pit"", at the end they reappear bigger and better * the only thing that they got it right (in my opinion) is the fact that dreams are mainly events from the previous day then fears and desires.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, especially to kids.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it more than one star is because of Pixar's animation. Disney's story ruined the end product."

Then things really fall apart which is sad. Then things vanish which makes you sad. Then something is sacrificed and things are sad again. But sadness is OK..., right?

","I was expecting a funny lighthearted animated movie, one I have come to expect from Pixar. Unfortunately there was only one funny scene, but it was the scene I already watched in the trailer. Instead I had to endure over an hour of the most depressing movie I have ever brought my daughter to see. It seems as though Pixar tried desperately to make a movie with an adult theme (ie the psychological workings of emotions in the mind, with a plot that is, unfortunately, commonplace in real life ) but with goofy animation that appeals to children.. I wish they stuck to the adult humor that goes over the kid's heads rather than serious issues that goes over the kid's heads.. Sadly in the end, the ""happy"" ending was only mildly happy. Not nearly happy enough to raise me up out of the depression the movie had sank me into.. I left the cinema down, and that's not what I like to spend money on. I asked my daughter, ""so what would you give it out of 10?"" She said ""an 8"" but when she got into the car she seemed sad, I asked her was she OK? and she started to cry and retold me a part of the movie she found sad.. Unfortunately that didn't go over her head."
"rfinnct","3","97","219","21 November 2015"," Poor entitled white girl's journey to entitlement
","Let me start this review off by saying it's written by a white male, so there isn't any built-in angst or bias. I'm also totally NOT p.c. and it's extremely rare I find anything overtly offensive in any media. That said, I was still highly insulted by this movie, its presentation of first-world problems as life shattering, and its oversimplification of human emotions -- supposedly there are only 5, and anything other than ""joy"" is unacceptable. <br/><br/>The story centers on a white, middle-class girl who, (DEAR GOD) gets uprooted from her idyllic home to a nice looking place in one of the most expensive cities in North America. The fact that her many worldly possessions are delayed (not lost, mind you... just delayed) causes her psyche to tailspin from one ruled with the perky yet iron fist of Joy to one tinged with Sadness. The horror!! Get this girl some Paxil and a bottle of Evian!<br/><br/>I'm not saying that a big life change such as a move isn't grounds for an emotional upheaval (especially in children); but to present it as an event that could very well cause irreparable damage to your mental state is being a tad over dramatic. There are children who starve on the streets of our country, and I'm supposed to feel empathy for some girl whose memories of ice skating with her parents are suddenly slightly touched with sadness? How can I live if I don't know if she'll EVER find happiness in her generously-sized room in San Francisco?! She has melancholy chats with her friends via webcam on a laptop, and exhibits hissy fits at the dinner table while the plate in front of her is full of food. Obviously there should be some kind of telethon or fund raising concert to extract her from this inconceivable situation!<br/><br/>Joy has taken a back seat to anger and sadness, so obviously there's something inherently wrong here and it must be corrected. The harsh realness of real reality is too much for this child to bear, so lets all wait with bated breath to see if Joy will take her rightful place as the ruler of this girl's head. We all know the painful plight of a little white girl who suddenly has to deal with the unthinkable indignity of a new bedroom that's festooned with the heat and electricity of her old bedroom... but on a slightly smaller scale. And the insult of not one, but TWO caring parents who try to provide for her? It's no small wonder that Joy isn't her overriding emotion on a daily basis when she obviously has so much working against her. <br/><br/>I think you get the point. This movie is ""deep"" only for those who are too superficial to see how trite the first world problems presented here are; then there's the ridiculous notion of ""if you're feeling anything other than happy, this must be corrected since it will result in the destruction of memories, friendships, family ties, and a feeling of self-worth."" Indeed the ending hints that nuances of emotions will form when two or more of them ""touch"" memories: however, it still presents it as unless Joy is at least part of every memory, then there's something wrong. On top of all that, it manifests the human mind as being something commandeered ONLY by raw emotions...nothing is tempered by knowledge, experience, logic, and the like. Obviously all of that could never be simplified to the point where it could still be a movie palatable to children. I totally realize it's meant to be a fun, cute film that kids can understand and relate to... but if you can't tell the story fully, why confuse kids by telling it at all?"

I think Disney paid some foreign company to be upvoted to 8.6 and cause me go and see and be disappointed with it. Shame. End of review.

","My daughter came to me this weekend and said we HAD to see Inside Out. I'm a big movie guy and usually get a kick out of kids movies because of the beautiful animation and witty comedy. When I read this was a Pixar movie and saw many of the rave reviews I was all in.<br/><br/>It started out with a great premise. Little girl (Riley) is born as an only child to a loving family living in Minnesota. We are introduced to the lead character, Joy, who is part of the team that provides Riley with all of her emotions. Joy is exactly as the name describes, she provides the Joy for Riley. However, we are also introduced to Sadness, Fear, and Disgust.<br/><br/>Inside of Riley's mind is a complex system of ""personality islands,"" thought trains, memory storage systems, and a crew in charge of sending forgotten about memories to a ""dump"" where the memories are forever forgotten. Basically, Joy is an overachiever who feels it is her duty to control Riley's emotions 90% of the time while limiting the control of the other emotions. Nothing wrong with that as we all would like our kids to be joyous 90% of the time. <br/><br/>Shortly after we establish a relationship with Riley, the director decides to move the family to a dump in the middle of San Francisco. From here the story just tumbles downhill. Sadness begins to take over the control room, touching different memories and causing Riley to fall into early stages of depression. As Joy begins to sense this downward spiral things go wrong in the control room and one way or another Joy and Sadness are sent to the inner reaches of Riley's mind.<br/><br/>I won't follow the details from here on out as I only have a 1,000 word limit. From this point on (from about the 30 minute mark), this movie takes the audience through constant peril and depression as Joy struggles to get her and sadness back to the control room. Constant failure, constant heartbreak. This whole time Riley continues to tumble deeper into a state of depression.<br/><br/>The audience watched the next hour in a state of stunned silence. Nobody made a peep. I was very tempted to end this torture and grab my daughter and leave the theater. I cannot believe a movie like this was green lit, and let alone sent out by Pixar. My only hope for this review is that it helps keep families with high hopes away from going to this movie. It truly is a depressing movie and I heard more tears than laughter. I can't understand how that would get rave reviews. People's lives are hard enough as it is. To try and escape at the movies and see something like this is wrong.<br/><br/>Animation was great, not worth sitting through something as heartbreaking as this."
"aaron-oneill3","3","87","197","4 July 2015"," Disjointed, not funny and hard to relate to.
","I'll be short because I already feel like I've wasted enough time even seeing this film.<br/><br/>The main characters are emotions. Sadly the only characters one could potentially care about (The humans) are portrayed as robots or puppets in which the emotions are the puppeteers.<br/><br/>The film lags in the middle big time, I just wanted the bad jokes and boring middle to come to an end.<br/><br/>The idea that one is at the mercy of their emotions is very misinformed and a terrible message to send to kids.<br/><br/>Just so it's clear, I love Pixar films. Rarely am I disappointed. But this is trash!"
"arteminimal","9","43","92","21 June 2015"," Pixar has done it again. Maybe better than ever.
","Pixar has been the most daring animated movie studio this side of Japan. <br/><br/>With marvelous examples like UP, WALL-E and Finding Nemo they always find the proper way to introduce themes that many deemed too heavy for children and in a way that's both moving and thought provoking, like life after the loss of someone we love, loneliness, social alienation and mourning.<br/><br/>And now, we have Inside Out, the latest Pixar's work in an already fantastic oeuvre, and while it does not have the powerful drama and character development of UP or the magnificently executed reflection on solitude that was WALL-E it's no less complex as Inside Out choose to tackle something even more immediate: the complexity in our identity.<br/><br/>Riley's personality is well built and relatable, quite an achievement since, if we are strict, we could consider her a big plot vehicle for the true protagonists: Joy and Sadness. The way these two interact with each other and with Riley's identity –cleverly presented as a set of corridors of memory and isles of identity– is a phenomenal example of intelligent animation. <br/><br/>When you are sitting there just smiling to yourself about the brilliance of Pixar introducing psychoanalysis concepts to an audience composed mainly of children and explaining these concepts with clear and understandable visual metaphors you know you're witnessing something special.<br/><br/>And of course, being a Pixar movie, the emotive scenes are there, ready to move you and take you with them. There's charm, there are laughs. There's plenty of what's lacking in the movies of Dreamworks and others: there's heart.<br/><br/>I attended the premiere with my fiancée and my mother, who studied child psychology and worked with children with special needs for years and in the end she told us, with tears in her eyes: I never imagined something like this would ever be done. For my mother it was so moving and complex that she could not believe that children where understanding the movie so well.<br/><br/>However, I'm a little skeptical and that's why I'm not ready to give this movie the full 10/10. The movie is indeed complex, maybe too complex sometimes, and I think I saw a couple of children –and adults– not understanding many aspects of this fine film. One clear example was the abstract thoughts chamber. I don't think all of us are ready for something this clever, at least not in this format. However I welcome it with arms wide open. It is time we start respecting the intelligence of children.<br/><br/>Now, it's time for me to finish this, think about the movie for a while and take my imaginary friend to the moon."
"pennyelenabooks","3","51","112","25 January 2016"," Good enough
","Inside Out is the story of how emotions work in our minds (in a girl's mind to be precise). The emotions, Joy and Sadness, wonder around the girl's mind, aiming to find a way back to the controlling room where they can help her through a big change in her life. The story is interesting, but it gets boring towards the end, as the one twist follows the other. Joy is a control freak, dictating every emotions' move and pretty much dominating the girl's mood. Other than that, and the overjoy-full mood, Inside out is funny and entertaining. The colours are vivid and the action enough to make a good movie. But I guess the whole control room, memories, dreams etc etc are kind of confusing, with all the islands and the maze. So 3 out of 10."
"geoced","9","46","100","20 October 2015"," One of Pixar's best !
","After the uninspired ""Brave"" and the lazy sequels to ""Cars"" and ""Monsters Inc"", it seemed that Pixar had transferred its talent to Disney and vice versa : ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Big Hero 6"" clearly looked like Pixar productions, with their adult references and geek humour, while ""Brave"" was a traditional (dare I say boring ?) fairy tale and ""Cars 2"" a cheap sequel that Disney could have made. To me, it felt like Pixar was slowly losing the magic that made it stand out.<br/><br/>Then came the trailer for Pixar's latest movie, ""Inside Out"", and suddenly hope was renewed ! I thought that it looked very promising and I couldn't wait to see it ! The idea behind the movie is pretty simple : what if we could see what happened inside a person's brain ? While the french TV series ""Il était une fois... la Vie"" did it from a documentary perspective, Pixar opted for a subtle mix of comedy, drama and insightful ideas.<br/><br/>While the script may sound simplistic, it actually is really well thought out and everything falls into place perfectly. But the real genius comes from all the wonderful ideas the writers came with to materialize and explain how the human mind works.<br/><br/>I'm not going to beat around the bush : this movie is simply brilliant ! The last time Pixar took a risk with a truly innovative idea, they gave us ""Up"", and it was a complete success! It's nice to see that there are still a few writers and producers willing to push fresh ideas to the big screen! My only regret is that it was too short ! I wanted it to last 30 minutes more at least ! They could have expanded their concept a bit more, but at the same time it is true that the movie is quite dense and fast paced : I found myself rewinding or pausing the film several times to pick up all the small but delightful details.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" is a rare example of a movie that I would love to watch a second time right after it finished, and that tells a lot about its quality! For that reason, it definitively deserves a place in my personal top 3 Pixar movies, right there with ""The Incredibles"" and ""WALL-E"". 9/10"
"RforFilm","10","48","105","18 June 2015"," Inside Out is that emotional journey that has been missing from the movies for years. This is one of the best animated stories of all time!
","Inside Out may be the most cartoony story Pixar has released but it is also the most complex and mature. On the one hand, the majority of it is set within the mind of an eleven year old girl and her imagination, but the movie bears in mind (no pun intended) that the human brain is a complex organ that operates on many levels and circuits. The subconscious, abstract thought, memory and emotion all had to be given a physical form for Inside Out. Like a lot of people, I trust Pixar, yet didn't think that they had the talent to pull off something as unique, but crazy as the idea intended. <br/><br/>I like to think of my brain running like a computer with perfectly synthesized control in place that's ready to deal with the many problems of the real world as the machine is quick to place the right emotion in time. Not every emotion is correct, but with the right mindset, the solution eventually comes. Everyone thinks differently and I wouldn't have been surprised if the film's focus picked a different approach. Inside Out also presents a human mind that does run like a machine, but actually gives a personality to each emotion to run it. <br/><br/>A girl named Riley is living happily with her family in Minnesota. Her goofy and friendly personality is thanks to the emotion that runs her the most, Joy (played by Amy Poehler). She works with the other emotions, Fear (played by Bill Hader), Anger (played by Lewis Black), Disgust (played by Mindy Kaling), and not so much with Sadness (played by Phyllis Smith) to ensure that Riley remains that happy kid she is. But as with life, every kid has to come to their first big event that begins their journey into a full human. In this case it's a move.<br/><br/>Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the emotions are having a hard time figuring out the best reaction. Joy would like to continue for Riley to stay happy, but Sadness starts to have the effect of changing past memories from happy to sad. A fight between Joy and Sadness causes them to be sent to long term memory, leaving the other emotions to run Riley. The child clearly has trouble adapting to the big city life and starts to shut herself out, even considering running away. Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters to fix Riley, but Joy may not know what's best for everyone. <br/><br/>Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and Up, Inside Out is a buddy trip story that works because of it's leads. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith make a great time that work off of each other well. It's not just these two as all folks casted are well known comedians that are well placed in their roles. It kind of reminded me of The Lego Movie, but while that was meant to be a full comedy, Inside Out is one of the biggest emotional journeys ever put on screen.<br/><br/>I would love to see the writing process that this movie went though as both stories (the real world and the world inside Riley) connect and play so well that either could operate on their own, but they still need each other. Riley represents that hard part of childhood when they discover that the world is such a big place that we all go through what she did; fear about what could happen to us, disgust at what we don't understand, anger when things go wrong, sadness when we are at our lowest, and joy when we finally realize that things can still go well even after all of that.<br/><br/>I'll give this five happy memories out of five. Pixar has officially returned to form! Inside Out is the kind of movie that everyone will talk about for a long time; the kind of word of mouth that no one could ever buy; the one that kids will love the imagination from; the one that adults will find fascinating and emotional. Inside Out is a perfect movie and needs to be seen. It's not that you should consider watching this, but you NEED to see this."

The animation is an explosion of rainbows and the creativity shown to depict the happenings in the girl's brain is nothing short of amazing, although kids won't understand these ideas.<br/><br/>However, it got tedious after awhile and I felt restless.

"liquidb_84","4","66","150","12 November 2015"," Boring and depressing, with a couple good laughs mixed in
","I will say that this movie did make me laugh out loud quite a few times. There is some great observational humor that captures the eccentricities of the human mind (or cats as can be seen in the credits), but overall I found the movie to be pretty boring and depressing.<br/><br/>To start with there is basically no story or development of any of the characters. Riley moves to a new town, and the five emotions in her head have to figure out how to find balance/happiness after the move. The problem is that the whole movie is based around 5 characters (Joy, Disgust, Anger, Sadness, and Fear) all of whom are stagnant and kind of annoying.<br/><br/>Most of the story takes place in the ""control room"" of Riley's brain, and it appears that the animators were extremely lazy or uncreative when deciding what the room should look like. It is basically an empty purple bubble with a computer in the middle, considering this room is the scene for about half the movie I'm surprised they didn't try to make it a little more exciting.<br/><br/>On top of this the movie is very depressing, and not in a ""good cry"" kind of way, but in a ""growing up sucks, you are going to be unhappy for the rest of your life"" kind of way. Despite the fact that Joy is the leader of Riley's emotional control team, we constantly see sadness (who should have been called depression) constantly pull Riley down into the pits of useless, apathetic despair. On top of this we see that the leaders of Mom and Dad's emotional control teams are Sadness and Anger respectively; oh the joys of being an adult.<br/><br/>Over the course of the movie Riley's memories go from those of mostly childlike happiness, to the bittersweet jaded memories of an adult. It seems that adults in the world Pixar created can no longer feel pure joy, their emotions are always tinged with a hint of anger, sadness, or disgust. Maybe this is true for a lot of people, but I think kids should enjoy their blissful naive ignorance for as long as possible. I would not bring your kids to this movie unless you feel the need to forewarn them of the depressing future they have to look forward to."
"ikhwan_arif","6","5","7","21 April 2018"," Riley Didn't Learn Anything. When Feelz > Realz
","On some level, Inside Out does a somewhat admirable job at trying to explain to children (and I guess, easily impressed adult children) how emotions work... sort of. It tries to explain that our emotions control our mental faculties, that we think BECAUSE of our emotions. <br/><br/>This line of thinking is far too naive. <br/><br/>What old Pixar was really good at doing, is telling a story that had both a simplicity that made children understand and a maturity which reflects the reality of the world. It was exceedingly clever and charming and it taught children on how the real world works. Inside Out however, is too fictitious to be taken seriously, and not fictitious enough to be taken lightly. <br/><br/>First off, to think that our thoughts and minds and behaviors are controlled by emotions is just patently wrong. Feelings are not reality. Humans are not a manifestation of feelings, the environment is not built upon emotions. Emotions are a symptom of how our minds process our environment. <br/><br/>We are happy when something good happens to us, we get angry when we are transgressed, we are sad when we lost something of value to us, we are disgusted by things that would harm us, we are afraid of things that we don't understand. Emotions are reactions, not actions. <br/><br/>So right off the bat, the premise of the film is already off. Things are not made any better with the plot. The film centers around Joy, (an emotion of 12 year old girl Riley) having forced to confront a life-altering change and going through a coming of age journey, learning things about Riley, about Joy itself and of other emotions Anger, Disgust, Fear and specifically Sadness<br/><br/>This journey is something that Riley should go through herself, by learning to deal with overwhelming emotions, rather than represented by proxy through Joy. Instead, the movie shows Riley simply ""feel"" things that are happening to her, rather than understand what's going on and take responsibility and accountability for her own wellbeing - which is the essence of growing up. By the end of the show, Riley herself didn't learn anything, she didn't have any growth. <br/><br/>Despite this obvious and blatant flaw in the plot, everything else is acceptable. <br/><br/>It shows that every emotion is critical in the development of a child, including hardships and sadness. It shows how experiences, and how we recollect them, shapes who we are. Riley's reactions towards the internal turmoil that she is experiencing is very convincing. <br/><br/>Amy Poehler performance as joy is right on the mark, while the rest of the cast and crew does an admirable job as well. I wish the story was better, Pixar used to be better. Despite all my ranting, it's still an enjoyable movie."
"Metronome11","4","66","154","26 June 2015"," So sad it took me an entire day to get over it!
","Do NOT see this movie unless you are either a Psych major, or have lived a life that is free from sorrow or emotional trauma. <br/><br/>As usual Pixar has produced a digital masterpiece, with an inventive plot, original characters, and loads of modern scientific content. However, unfortunately, they chose to depict a young child going through a deep existential crisis, in which all the bases of her emotional world view are shattered, crushed, collapsed, etc. <br/><br/>I was sobbing much of the way through, and off and on during the night. About 24 hours later I recovered enough to get back to my normal life activities. In fact it made me want to go back on drugs, to assuage the pain that it dredged up!<br/><br/>I advise ""taking a Valium"" beforehand, to minimize the effects of the deep sadness."
"Diogo_Costa","9","37","81","26 June 2015"," Psychology. The (brilliant) animation.
","After five years of relatively fine, solid releases, but with some missteps along the way, Pixar rises again and returns to its former glory with Inside Out.<br/><br/>Inside Out runs on the tracks of an apparently straightforward plot of a possible life-changing event for young Riley to present a wonderful display of creativity and imagination, maybe the best from the studio.<br/><br/>Human psychology is the setting where emotions come to life to tell the story of the chaotic and somewhat abstract events occurring inside Riley's head with exceptional attention to detail and an impressive clarity. Between nods to the studio's classics and the work of Hayao Miyazaki, everything is carefully thought and perfectly executed, adding an incredible depth and complexity to the amusing spectacle. <br/><br/>From all charm and fun to its heart-breaking moments and bittersweet realizations, there is no doubt that Inside Out deserves a place among the likes of Wall-E or UP. And although it suffers from a lack of a toys-holding-hands-in-a-furnace moment, Inside Out winds up to stand out as the most daring and inventive Pixar film to date - and one of my favorite displays of apathy ever."

"ironhorse_iv","9","31","67","23 June 2015"," This was mind blowing! This movie was a feel good movie.
","Don't be close-minded. Open your mind to new things, like this movie. It's worth-checking out. Directed by Peter Docter, the movie tells the story of a group of emotions in a little girl's head, trying to deal with a tough, life-changing event. While, the emotions; Joy (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (Voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (Voiced by Bill Hader), and Disgust (Voiced by Mindy Kaling), want to make the best, out of it; things start to unravel for Riley Anderson (Voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), as her emotions find, that growing up is more difficult, than it seems. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, that this movie is more than a feeling. It's well-crafted animation. Still, there are things in the film that I can nitpick about. While, this isn't really a bad thing, I believe the movie might be a little too sophistication for certain younger audiences. I like how the movie is challenging kids to understand, their own brains, but the movie kinda leaves, some kids confused. Maybe, it need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are so much references to Trait theory, abstract thought, Cognitive neuroscience, and the subconscious that kids haven't yet, understood. The humor kinda blends, the same way. You have to be very observed to get some of the jokes here. Jokes like how opinions and facts often get mixed up on the train of thought, might fly pass you, if you're not paying attention. It's very smart, clever, and sublime. Not only is the movie full of mindful jokes, but the movie is the brim with throwbacks to Pixar's previous films, some of them obvious, some of them so hidden in the background that a deeper perceived might be needed. I like all the oddball sequences that the film had to offer. Places like Dream Production, Imaginationland, and Subconscious were pretty cool to see. The world in which, the character live in, is so unique. What a beautiful mind. I love it! I love, every character in this film. The voice acting is amazing. Each one of them, gave a lot of depth to their character. The story is very heart-felt. There are a lot of tear-jerking moments. So, make sure, to bring some tissues! ""Take her to the moon for me, okay?""- I was really crying when that moment came. While, the movie is PG, there are a few scary moments that might be a little too scary for small children. Watch out for Mr. Jangles! I love, how the movie deals with a lot of complex things, such as intertwined relationship in parenthood, camaraderie and friendship. Other things that the movie dealt with, is the heartbreaking realization, that the transience of time will inevitable, lead to more complicated feelings, that parents need to be aware, of. One of the most potent about the movie is learning to accept the undeniable encroachment of Sadness into your life. While, it's good to keep a relentless optimism mind. It's not a bad thing, to feel sad or depress when you need it. Empathy is very important and poignant emotion to have. That's heavy! Neuroscientists were consulted to help make the film's settling of an eleven year girl's brain, very believable and I believe, it's very close to how a young mind, might work. Director Peter Docter got the idea for the project, from his daughter. He always wonder, what was going through her mind. So, he created this movie, using it as an allusion/representation of him as a father watching his own daughter go through emotions like those; that Riley had to deal with. While, a lot of critics, are saying, this movie is very original. I have to say, not really. After all, Peter Docter pretty much copy the concept from his previous work on Cranium Command, the Walt Disney Epcot attraction about the human body and watching earlier Disney short films, like 1943's Reason and Emotion. While the movie isn't that original. The movie moves in a very logically pace. Still, there were a lot of head-scratching moments that made me wonder: What were, they thinking? One of them, is how Sadness and Joy couldn't find their way, back to the Headquarters. There were many good examples of ways, Sadness and Joy could make their trip to HQ, a lot easier, such as using Bing Bong's wagon or recall. Both were establish, way early on in the film, but barely use, until late into the film. Honestly, it would have work, better than the odd Deus Ex Machina trampoline that they found. Another thing that people asking questions is how other people in the film usually have all of their emotions match their gender, but not Riley's. There is a possible explanation to this. While, Riley is a girl with a unisex name. She's a tom-boy, so it wouldn't be, too surprising that she would have two male emotions. I really doubt, she is a transgender, but who knows. I think her mind is bit young, so she still possibly figuring her emotions and identify out. With time, maybe, she also will have emotions adequate to her own basic template. Another thing is while, there is a huge variety of emotions, I think the emotions, they picked, work the best. While the movie is full of familiar Pixar tropes and clichés. I'm glad, that Pixer is back, where they belong. It's was very worrisome, for a while. I really didn't like those lackluster, strategic sequels that they kinda put out, a few years ago. Overall: I really love this movie. I haven't met one person that hate this film, yet. You really have to out of mind, if you hate it, because the movie delivers in every way! So don't live with Anhedonia! Go see this movie! It's worth watching! It's mind-treat!"
"LapachoPan","4","57","134","21 August 2015"," Good presentation, bad storytelling.
","Pixar took a familiar idea, personifying emotions, and decided to tell a story about them running rampant, tearing a girl's memory apart and destroying her personality. The problem is that emotions don't govern a self-conscious person's thoughts, they only inform them. This is only the first of the film's many inconsistencies.<br/><br/>There are too many moments where a plot device is introduced but promptly ignored for convenience of the story they wanted to tell. The over-simplified emotions present clumsy and sometimes offensive stereotypes of themselves and other characters. The narrative feels like a pasted-together brainstorming session and concludes itself with a solution that should've been common sense from the beginning.<br/><br/>It's easy to dismiss these criticisms as being irrelevant in a children's film, but Pixar doesn't make films exclusively for children. This simply isn't a good movie."

","Inside Out is one of Pixars most original and heartwarming films. It uniquely represents human emotions as individual characters, showing how things happening on the outside aren't always as simple on the inside. As usual, Pixar does this with a perfect combination of heavily emotional but also lots of comedic moments to keep it dynamic.<br/><br/>I walked into the theater with high expectations and was not disappointed, in fact, the movie was better and so much deeper than I expected. The 'emotion' characters were not one-dimensional (for example: the character that represents anger isn't 100% driven by anger all of the time). The movie cleverly explains emotion and psychological phenomenon to kids so that it triggers their imagination and makes them think of the human brain in more interesting way. Many kids can relate to Riley and this movie helps them understand why they are sometimes feeling the way they do.<br/><br/>Overall the story is about a girl who moved to a new city and struggles with her new lifestyle. She goes through a phase that maybe doesn't look too serious on the outside but as I said, there is a huge mess going on inside her head. The most developed character is Joy and she struggles to keep the situation under control. Even tho she's very optimistic, she goes through something similar that Riley herself is going through which is the process of growing up.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>P.S. the music was brilliant."

Some are disappointed because it is not Toy Story or other Pixar movie. Personally, I don't see why it makes sense to compare this with any other title! This movie is unique in the sense that it tries to explain the workings of the brain in an understandable way. And it's been a long time since a movie affected me like this one... Last ones where Dogville and Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>I have a 6 year old boy who is a fantastic kid but with some behavioral problems. I've shown him this movie so that he can understand his occasional anger and frustration attacks better. While I watched with him, I loved the way the deeds and interactions of the mind control task force is reflected in the real-world behavior of Riley.<br/><br/>But it got especially good when the plot shows that Sadness (shunned by all as a pertinent danger to the mental health of Riley) actually is just as necessary as her counter party, Joy. Sadness has always been shunned by the others sentiments but when she is given the lead the results is not at all as tragic as we would expect... And at that point the movie comes to an yin and yang conclusion: we need both extremes of everything as only one is never complete. And you need all spikes to have a wheel. I loved that... Therefore, I also disagree with many critics who claim that this movie is too dark. It seems dark at times but the overall message is not that.<br/><br/>Where I do agree with other commenters is on the point that this really calls for a part 2 about adolescent Riley and the new set of psychological challenges connected to that..."
"wembleyfm","4","52","123","16 November 2015"," Mentally Challenging
","I'd read that this movie is a contender for not only Best Animated movie, but even Best Picture at the Oscars. This is a very different film to one I've seen from Disney/Pixar tackling a very adult theme in human emotions. It's clever in the way it portrays the emotions and takes us into the world of the subject's mind. What loses it for me is that the film seems lost between playing out as a psychiatric experiment and being a film to entertain little children. The moral of the story seems lost amongst the confusing adventure within the subject's brain. The concept is certainly original and no doubt will be used as a talking forum in biology or human development lessons for years to come...it belongs in educational circles."

","Inside out is movie about emotions. Various emotions depicted in the movie are joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. The movie is about a girl who grows up to 11 years of age and then faces, what we can say, her first major mental breakdown resulting in a sad core memory formation. This happens because of the reason they move from Minnesota to a new place. The dull phase of her life is gradually overcome as the movie progresses as she learns to handle emotions more nicely.<br/><br/>A human brain consists of various parts. It's fair to say that activity in certain part is responsible for a specific emotion. The movie has portrayed it very nicely. Human brain is very complicated structure. How it works majorly remains a mystery. The work done in the movie is a great representation of available information. The movie shows how a human being matures in terms of his emotions. Its shown how the girl learns to handle multiple emotions in terms of memory.<br/><br/>My personal favorite emotions(characters) go in order anger, fear, joy, disgust, and sadness. Anger being the most liked one. The movie is wonderful, great job done by creators. Fairly recommended."

","The previews were intriguing: the creative genius of Pixar tackling the human psyche on a fundamental level. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film dragged on with very little plot or substance. The anthropomorphic representations of emotion and memory are cute, but ultimately fail to provide the kind of sustained entertainment experience of other Pixar films. Basically, it seemed like enough story to fill out a short - repeated several times to make a feature.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film does capture the essence of pre-teen, middle class white girl angst - and it does have a few very poignant moments - but ultimately, it lacks the layered humor, well directed action, and general entertainment value that I have come to expect from Pixar.<br/><br/>On a brighter note, the short that preceded this film, ""Lava"", was awesome!"

","Being a fan of Pixar and judging by its reception by IMDb users and critics I was expecting this to be their best film to date. That seemed like quite a feat to top, as I personally think 'Up' is one of the most beautiful films ever made, so seeing as this was supposedly better than 'Up', I came in to the theater expecting something truly extraordinary. What I got was one and a half hours of bad puns, a superficial script which did not even scratch the surface of any sort of deep thought, and I also got several very forced ""emotial"" moments. And to top things of, the films rendering and animation was just above decent.<br/><br/>You will without a doubt have seen how people describe how tears were flowing when Bing Bong was left in the pit of black memory balls. It was so terribly sad when Jar-Jar Binks came out of nowhere and was extremely annoying for 5 minutes, before heroically sacrificing himself while delivering a line of dialogue which did not make me cry so much as sigh out loud.<br/><br/>I can assure you, dear reader, that I am not as grumpy as this review will have it look. I have yet to watch the opening of Up without having tears running down my cheeks. In order to explore why this film failed to deliver any sort of emotional punch, I will compare it to Up. First of all, what made Up such a powerful experience wasn't just the sad story of a man losing his wife, it was the music, the lights, and the colors. All of these things combined delivered a wide range of emotions without ever a word being uttered. My big problem with Inside Out was mainly the lack of this type of haunting beauty.<br/><br/>The script has been praised as ever so clever, witty and original, and I'll admit the film had me smiling at a few of the jokes. But the originality of the script can only be stretched as far as the idea of the film. The actual film lacked a lot of depth and ended up being almost bland. There was certainly potential of a great film in the idea, but I could not help feel that these ideas were lost when trying to keep this as a children's movie, which prevented any type of deep exploration of real human emotion and behavior.<br/><br/>All of the points above leave me rather confused about what Inside Out really was, or rather what it tried to be. Was it a comedy? Sort of... Was it an adventure? Well, sort of... Was it emotional? Well, not really... Was it exciting? Well, sort of... Was it even a film? Well, sort of... A not very arousing conclusion to this review of what could have been Pixars greatest film. In the end people might be so caught up the great idea behind the film, and this excitement means they would have decided on an opinion before even seeing the film, and thus, an 8.4 rating on IMDb"
"adj-jarvis","4","44","106","3 August 2015"," Completely average.
","I'll start by saying I enjoy majority of Pixar films. In fact, I love them! However, unfortunately I do not think that this film lived up to Pixar's name. <br/><br/>Initially, I thought the general idea for the film was fantastic and very fresh. A great idea doesn't always make a great film though. <br/><br/>To start with, the film was interesting to see how they incorporated the Inside characters and to see how they would interact with one another etc. But as soon as the story kicked in, the film started to become quite dull and boring. There are orbs that contain memories that are transferred to the 'Inside' headquarters and some get stored in a special place where the memory will last forever. Anyway, two of the Inside characters, Joy and Sadness are sucked up in to this tube and sent out of headquarters and so the film is focused on those two characters. This was annoying because I felt they were the two most unlikable characters in the film. Sadness was just irritating and Joy was cringey and also quite irritating. They are soon joined by an imaginary friend character created by the girl whose head they are inside and he brings it to life a little more as he is more of a likable character. However the film soon dries up again.<br/><br/>The best part in the film was *BIG SPOILER* when the imaginary friend sacrifices himself and dies and I say the best part because its one of the only parts in the film that actually made me 'feel'. The rest I didn't care much for. Ironic as the film is all about emotions and such. <br/><br/>To sum up, this film was very boring and they could of possibly explored more with the general idea.<br/><br/>9/10 for originality, 4/10 for entertainment value."

","Just finished the movie and somethings didn't exactly feel right. I mean first of all five emotions were acting like themselves except sadness. She wasn't sad she was clearly depressed. When you are sad you want to cry out your lungs yet she was hopeless and tired all the time. And the main message of the movie didn't make sense to me at all. The depression which Riley's been suffering was not something crying and experiencing the sadness would've fixed which she wasn't even denying being sad from the beginning just at some point sadness decided to go. And when it was back it stopped Riley from running away from home?How? Why?Was she sad she was going to be alone? I mean her feeling sad just should've made it harder and longer her acceptance of her new conditions for all I see with its presence.Or maybe sadness cornered her saying if you want to avoid pain avoid me just accept all of this I don't know maybe this was the message intended."

","I hate to see so many 1 star reviews claiming this movie was ""too depressing"". Everyone who said that missed the point completely. Growing up ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it comes with a lot of hardships and that's what this movie is about. Riley's emotions try to help her through the difficulty of moving to a new place that isn't all its cracked up to be, and in the process Joy accidentally sends Riley into a deep depression. Sounds depressing, but what makes this movie great is how realistic her depression feels as Joy and Sadness try to help Riley out of it. I feel like this movie's message is ""Growing up will be tough, but you will get through it and there are people who will always help you through it."" and that is a VERY important message for children.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there are plenty of good jokes, gorgeous animation, and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino (idk how to spell that....) Again, just my two cents, but I think this a great movie, if very different and a bit more depressing by Pixar standards.<br/><br/>REALLY starting to think people are just coming to trash all of Pixar's most recent movies out of jealousy or something. There's no way so many people think this movie is garbage. If the good movies are really getting this many bad reviews, it's no wonder the quality of animated movies is going down.

"elaroiznew","4","35","85","19 July 2015"," Meh... Not their best.
","First off, I'll start by saying that I usually judge ""kid\family"" animation movies by the amount of tears and tissue involved. Yes, I'm an emotional person, and I tear up easily, especially when it comes to kids animation movies.<br/><br/>Up and Toy Story owe me 4 boxes of tissue. These movies where emotionally on point. I don't recall Finding Nemo making me tear up, but I do remember it was a hell of a good movie. No wonder it's one of the top grossing films up until this year.<br/><br/>But this time. I was emotionally disappointed. I only cried once, and it was for a brief scene. And I'm as emotional as it gets, trust me. Kinda ironic considering the movie literally revolves around emotions.<br/><br/>The plot is the worst part of the movie. The girl comes off as a spoiled brat with nothing better to do than make up non-existing problems for herself. Which makes sense, considering she had the perfect American girl life. Did I already mention spoiled? Oh, and she's also an only child, shocker.<br/><br/>She seemingly got into a what you would call ""clinical depression"" as a result of moving out. Like seriously? There are kids out there who deal with life threatening illnesses, poverty, abusive parents and whatnot yet this girl snaps off from moving out?<br/><br/>The most bizarre part in the movie is when she's on her first day at school. She didn't get socially rejected, she didn't get bullied, yet she miraculously got depressed\upset after merely introducing herself to the class.<br/><br/>Not to mention that according to the time-line (she sleeps, wakes up), her so called ""clinical depression"" only lasted like 4 days. Are you kidding me? There are people out there who deal with clinical depression their ENTIRE LIVES.<br/><br/>And the blue sad emotion doesn't make any sense. All these ""oops I don't know why I'm doing this"". How can you have an emotion that ""doesn't know""? Doesn't this defeat the whole point of attempting to explain our emotions? All I got from this movie was ""Why are you sad?"" - ""I don't know"".<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was not absolutely horrible:<br/><br/><ul><li>The animation was nice, not over the top</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There was this one scene which made me tear up a little bit. It's when the elephant-cat creature sacrificed himself to get ""Joy"" out of the abyss. I didn't cry because he died, but because he sacrificed himself. Sacrifices always make me emotional.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>there was this one adult joke about facts and opinions. The elephant-cat creature accidentally dropped boxes of 'opinions' and 'facts'. Then the elephant-cat said something along the lines of ""just shove them all in this sack, people can't tell them apart anyhow"". I liked how this was a political comment about people who think their opinions are facts\better than other's opinions.</li></ul>"

Giving them a way to grow and learn as if they were humans just adds to that whole thing. There is so much going on here, that it would take too many words and space to go into detail of it all.

","To simplify complex things without losing their complexity is an utmost art. So I marvel at what they made work here and how deeply illuminating of life with such simple pieces, toys essentially. I believe it will go far in estimation. It's not intellectual - but it's driven by surpassing intellectual ability. It's inspirational - but colors everything on the way out with something that goes beyond ""inspiration"". <br/><br/>We have the animated ride about overcoming obstacles to be there for someone, the ride is great fun, the vistas imaginative; a lot of care went into making the inner architecture simple in textures and ""locations"", with childlike order. But the ride is transferred inside the mind of a little girl and they begin to build something else there. <br/><br/>Five emotions inside the heroine's head vying for controls of life, directing a ""movie"". External reality seen through screens and ""cameras"" that project cinematic light that carries memory. Memories stored in gleaming orbs that contain them. Colors associated with emotions. All this very simple, it goes without saying, that in other hands or other contexts it would appear reductive.<br/><br/>But the way it simplifies complex life inside the heroine's head to simple essentials that we can accept as building material for ours, how well they tied inner and outer so that I found myself nodding every time the bumbling ""emotions"" translated as believable behavior outside - all the different pieces come together by the end to form such a strong mechanism, simple without feeling like we have missed any nuance in the process. And all this as someone's soul at stake.<br/><br/>So far so good, fun, vibrant, intelligent. Maybe the best Pixar already. And then they turn the gear once more and color everything - it's one of the most poignant endings I've seen, it floored me and I'm someone who doesn't give to just anyone the power to touch me.<br/><br/>It illuminates - a happy memory only possible because of a sad one that preceded and these as part of the same flow - sadness that must touch all things - sadness that is joy and vice versa - multiply colored orbs now, each one a small gem of inferred ambiguous life. Each one a simple piece by itself. It has created a simple order in the soul, torn it and created another, simple but richer. With other animation films, we lose too much of our nuance in the process of simplifying, not here. The apogee is the lasting impression of seeing myself. Reflections released from their orbs and allowed to float would have a farflung (Malickian) view. But it's what we put into them from our ""orbs"" that lets us see. We would like our inner murk to be this simple so we accept it and are better off for it, nurturing our ability to see ourselves simply. To simplify complex things without losing their complexity is an utmost art. How much more so the art of simplifying ourselves without losing our complexity?"

","This isn't my usual kind of movie, but I was persuaded to watch it. I have to say, it's rather brilliant and would appeal to adults and children alike. It's basically about growing up and changing and leaving the things of childhood behind. Hidden behind the humour and the familiar Pixar style is a very poignant story of every human's attempt to make sense of the world around them. I think all children go through a phase of thinking their bodies are run by tiny people inside them. Pixar has taken this idea and turned emotions--joy, fear, anger, disgust--and made them real little characters all helping to control a child's brain. When an upset in life comes along, Joy is lost (literally). She has to find her way back into the control centre of the brain to stop a catastrophe happening, but along the way she discovers some unusual allies. Great humour, genuine pathos, and clever witty dialogue, this film is an absolute winner."

This growth is our new understanding of ourselves after the story.<br/><br/>First, accept every mood.<br/><br/>We are always eager joy rather than sadness, praise optimistic rather than negative. Social culture encourage us to be a human being that lively， outgoing, active and full of energy, however, not everybody is joy in midfield with a confident ""I can fix it"" against all odds.<br/><br/>Most of the time, it is the negative emotions in our life give us strength: sadness makes us deeply, to learn and to experience, to increase the component of the life; fear enable us to plan ahead, driving a boat million years with fear; anger offer us a bottom line, to warn the enemies; disgust decide character, in case we follow suit and lost ourselves. Joy does make us better, but many times the blind optimism does not work. It likes meteors sweeping in a hurry, bright and brilliant, while what everlasting is deep and extensive dark in the sky.<br/><br/>At the start maybe we all like pure Joy, don't make sense about the meaning of Sadness's existence and want to exclude her from the outside. However, it seems that life do not get perfect while lose the ability of feeling sad. There are many difficult moments in people's growth, even one thousand funny films don't make sense to get rid of them, but cry in a quiet corner works. So at last we will walk through the road of Joy, understand that it is Sadness lead us to the light, she is a part of our life.<br/><br/>All kinds of moods shape us together. Accept them, then we can accept ourselves sincerely.<br/><br/>Second, growth is accompanied by the losing. <br/><br/>There are different roads for different body when we grow up, some come down in the world, some have a serious illness, some move from countryside to city. This is a process that no one can escape, childhood becomes the soap bubbles floating under sunshine in the moment we see the intricacies world of adult.<br/><br/>This is not a growth film only for children，everyone suffered losing. the losing of the memory ball, the losing of personality island. However, losing is a necessary part cannot be separated from growth, it is a process mix up joy and sorrow. <br/><br/>From simple to complex, from children to adult, and a faint ""adolescence"" at the end, Inside out is still a bright and brilliant story."

","There is a unique concept to this movie that is found in no other movie. The way they tackle the teenage mind and how it functions is incredible, especially while able to add humor in the mix. The angle they approach the discussion of depression is remarkable. The movie will take you on a emotional rollercoaster. Even Mr. Macho might shed some tears. As some people might say it is too heavy for kids, I beg the question how do you know your kid isn't feeling this way currently? As you leave the theatre in tears it forces you to ponder the question what is going on inside thier head, and allows us to reevaluate our out look on life."

","23 June 2015. This innovating, educational, appealing, and emotion-laden animated movie dazzles with a spectrum of delightful and meaningful portrayals throughout its 94 minute running time. Not since Wall*e (2008), Robin William's What Dreams May Come (1998), La Planete sauvage (1973), The Incredibles (2004), or Spirited Away (2001) has there been an animated movie that brings out a fresh, vibrant experience involving deep universal emotions between family members. The movies incorporates of a creative, simplified but reliable look at the brain and emotions and how each one of them, especially those that might surprise many audience members are essential for human authenticity and mental health.<br/><br/>What's even more impressive is Inside Out avoids reliance on super special effects to compel the audience to awe and wonder, but rather a playful assortment of imaginative visions that oftentimes Japanese animated movies have been famous for and uses a substantive, meaningful, spirited script to keep the audience entranced with its universal themes of the ties that bind joy and sadness. This is well balanced movie that elicits laughter, sadness, anger, and happiness and all the emotions reflected in the movie without crass marketing manipulation."

"zetes","9","26","63","21 June 2015"," Tremendous
","Amazingly complex animated film that builds the inside of an 11 year-old girl's mind as a fantastical world of wonder. Five basic emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust, live inside the mind of Riley and are in control of her attitude and memories. Joy (Amy Poehler) has done a good job of leading the emotions up to this point, but when Riley's parents drag her to San Francisco for her father's job, Sadness (Phyllis Smith) becomes more powerful, much to Joy's chagrin. The metaphors Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen have created in this girl's mind are insanely clever. Very quickly you get a bit ahead of the film, understanding Riley's emotional responses and the inner workings of her mind before we see her, in real life, react. It actually gets so abstract at times I think I wouldn't recommend the film for younger children - it probably is meant more for children closer to Riley's age, and their parents (and adults in general) will probably get more out of it than any child will. There's a bit of a slapstick element, and, honestly, sometimes it feels a bit out of place. As one might expect, the animation is wonderful. The fantastical world is beautiful, but for me it was the characters who really stood out. Joy in particular is one of Pixar's all-time greatest characters, and she's perfectly performed by Poehler. This is definitely one of Pixar's best movies."

The entire premise is sad, dark, and even the ""happy"" characters like Bing Bong disappear in a depressing way. <br/><br/>While it was an interesting movie into the human mind, it's not the type of movie I would like to bring a child to.

For the majority of the movie I was trying not to scream at the screen. For example....SPOILER....The part when Sadness is touching all of the Memories....WHAT WAS SHE THINKING??? Shes like that one person you work with who is miserable and make everyone else miserable.

","Well, I have to admit. I was near the edge to give up my favorite animation studio. I grew up with Pixar. All of the movies I have watched when I was a little child, it was all Pixar movies and they are still growing up with me.<br/><br/>However, when I heard about making unnecessary sequels to my favorite movies (such as Monster University, Toy Story 4, Cars 3, Finding Dory, The Incredibles 2...) I was very disappointed. Because Disney's and Dreamworks's motto has become ""money, money and money"". I have given up Disney long time ago. (Actually, I'm re-thinking my decision since Big Hero 6 and How To Train Your Dragon. I love them.) And I was thinking why I liked Pixar. I loved Pixar because all these original and creative ideas. And none of them were created for making money, they all created for us to have fun. In my opinion, ""The Classics"" should be stay alone without unnecessary sequels.<br/><br/>Therefore, I was nearly gave up Pixar. Until I watched, one of the Pixar's very best movie, Inside Out."
"closeinsani_t","4","35","90","11 July 2015"," Great concept, lacking imagination and creativity.
","The screenplay for this movie was very emotionally captivating and the voice acting was spectacular! <br/><br/>My reason for the low rating is the ad campaign and animation style of the movie. Corporately this movie seems made for selling plush toys and the energetic style of the character animation represents this as a comedy when, in fact, it is much deeper than that. <br/><br/>The concept for traveling inside a child's mind gives limitless opportunities for your trippy cartoon gags and abstract adventures. When watching the movie my children (3yo girl 7yo boy) were either not interested trying to get up or falling asleep with the weighty emotional scenes. <br/><br/>Despite the lively character animation, the scenarios and sets were too straightforward and even bland. This movie would have felt better in the Blue Sky Ice Age style which is less toony. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie more for pre-teens and adults storywise which you would never get from the poster. Even then, Finding Nemo(9of10) is SO much better of a finding yourself coming of age adventure. <br/><br/>If you like Inside Out I get it, it did not deliver for me or my expectations. 3d was OK."
"dave118118","10","30","76","6 August 2015"," Intensely Emotional Magic
","I was in a packed screening of Inside Out at the Birmingham Everyman cinema on Saturday, consisting almost entirely of adults. Absolutely incredible movie and an early contender for the best picture Oscar. Can't remember the last time a film completely dazzled me like that.<br/><br/>It was overwhelmingly brilliant from the outset and the short 'Lava' set the tone beautifully. I feel as though Pixar have pushed boundaries here in terms of revolutionising the target demographic of animated films. It almost felt that this was a film aimed at adults with lots of winks for the kids rather than vice versa.<br/><br/>I like the way Pixar have scaled down the plot to something we've all seen before; kid moves to new place and find it tough to adjust, nothing new here. Yet Pixar managed to use this simple story arc to run havoc with their imaginations as to what happens within ones self at a time like this.<br/><br/>Hats off to Pixar for creating this stunning, intensely emotional family film. Still feeling all the feels."
"stephen-whipp","5","31","79","20 September 2015"," Totally unfocused
","I honestly do not know how this film is being given ratings of 10. <br/><br/>This is an example of a film which didn't know what it wanted to be. Firstly what is the target audience? The style of animation is clearly aimed at children, but the content simply is not. To make any sort of sense out of the unfocused storyline you need an adults understanding of the underlying material, which is hopelessly dumbed down, to the point of actually being wrong anyway. You also need a reasonable degree of empathy, or to have experienced such feelings, something younger children typically do not have<br/><br/>Then there is the question of who is the main character, Joy or Riley? Because what you have are 2 simultaneous plot lines (such that they are), linked through metaphor only, blurred by the failed attempt to give the emotions separate personalities<br/><br/>Ratings of 1 are overly harsh in my opinion, there are far worse films, but once you start thinking about it, it just isn't great."

","News flash for all these people complaining -- Pixar makes sad movies! This should not be news to anyone who has seen a Pixar movie before. And anyone who thinks that that's a bad thing in this case are the ones who the moral of this movie is aimed at. The other complaint that people are having is that they heard it's an original story, when in fact the 'voices in your head' idea has been done before. Yeah, the basic concept has been shown, but so has every concept. And it's not the concept that people are talking about being original; it's the moral. It was absolutely brilliant how they went about explaining a complex moral in a way that children can understand yet doesn't feel overly preachy either. It is a difficult balance to strike, and no matter how well you do it, someone will always dislike it. It shouldn't make me as angry as it does that so many people are misunderstanding this movie. There'll always be somebody, but this is as close to a perfect movie as you'll ever see, and I really wish that there weren't so many stupid people ruining it."

A point that I like about this movie is it avoids falling into a category of ""just amaze the audience"" movies. There is some meaning in many parts of the movie that is open to discussion.

"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","5","28","73","26 June 2015"," Inside Out Review
","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for Inside Out I had high hopes and who wouldn't Pixar is a studio that really hasn't let me down. I don't mean that all there movies are great but at least they were entertaining. But I am sad to say that era has ended for me. Inside Out just doesn't live up to its former predecessors.<br/><br/>I told one of my fellow screeners last night this was a mediocre rehash of Toy Story just with the toys now being inside the child's head. Riley's family move from Minnesota to San Fransisco and of course nothing is going as it should be the house doesn't live up to the hype Riley dreamed up, the movers are lost and keep pushing back the delivery date, and of course the dreaded new school.<br/><br/>Then we have the emotions inside Riley's head who instead of coming together and getting Riley through this they are in conflict with each other which leads to Riley losing focus on who she is and what made her her which leads Riley down a dark path.<br/><br/>Now why do I say that this movie does not live up to the Pixar movies that came before? Pixar is usually good at balancing adult and kid humor making it fun for the whole family to sit down and watch the movie and sadly I feel that Inside Out did not do this. There were certain scenes that I was sitting there bored with. Some scenes just didn't make any sense whatsoever, making it feel like they threw stuff in there so they could pad the run time. Don't get me wrong there was some humorous scenes that I enjoyed in this movie, especially some of the end credit outtakes but overall I just feel this movie lacked anything really new to the scene. Like I stated before I feel we have seen this storyline in some form or another just this time they are using emotions as the point of view vice toys, etc.<br/><br/>Now the kids that were in the audience seemed to enjoy this movie overall. As I said before it does go a little dark, kind of like Toy Story 3 but I think they went a little further. So at least if you are taking your kids out to see this they should be entertained I can't say the same for all the adults out there. Also there is really no point in the 3D glasses nothing really jumped out at me making me glad to see this movie in 3D. Heck 3/4ths of the way through the movie I remembered that I was actually wearing the glasses.<br/><br/>I know that this is the first really kid movie of the summer and families are probably going to flock to it. And most likely those that love Disney and Pixar are going to see it as well. I hope that they find more enjoyment in it than I did. <br/><br/>My Recommendation:<br/><br/>Rent It."
"Kubricksboy","10","26","67","27 June 2015"," A Magnificent Piece Of Imagination
","People say never to play with someone's emotions because it might hurt them. But in what way, many of us may wonder? Well here's your answer, Inside Out portrays the game your emotions play in a way no movie has ever done before, to an extent no movie will ever go hereafter. An emotional ride, a literal emotional ride which is as joy as it is sad to watch, which will show what anger and disgust feel like while carefully portraying fear, all in the mind of Riley, our protagonist or so we think because that's what the movie is trying to do, to make us think and think we will for there isn't another animated film more engaging in the genre of drama. Why do you sometimes feel lost? Why can't you sometimes anything? How are your feelings lost? The film answers all such questions with an extremely controlled grasp on the imagination of it's creators. The execution of the film being near perfect it only makes the story look more magnificent than it already is. Pete Doctor and Pixar deliver again an animated movie which the world of cinema lovers will cherish for years to come. A genuine story so original that every second of it has something new to offer to the audience. The actors and actresses who though only use their voices portray the individual emotions to a stellar extent. Sadness being the best of all emotions both acting-vise and character-vise stands out with joy giving tough competition to sadness again both acting-vice and character-vice. The background score though not very impressive but engaging through out the second act but that's not what you will be busy listening, you will be busy praising the highly imaginative story . To sum up in one line. It is one of very few original films out there which no Film lover should miss."
"psmaher","4","27","70","27 July 2015"," A list of emotions
","This is a movie about a basic list of emotions. I guess it is important for kids to know that there is such a list of primary and secondary emotions - but there are tertiary emotions as well. It strikes me that someone was struggling to work this through a committee of some sort - it feels like more American self-congratulatory, 'WOW! Aren't we clever.' There are too many hands on the tiller of this one. It might be a worthy flick for kids to discuss in class - particularly Psych 101 or even Writing 101. The list: Love (affection, lust, longing), Joy (cheerfulness, zest, contentment, pride, optimism, enthrallment, relief), Surprise (surprise - amazement, astonishment), Anger (irritation, exasperation, rage, disgust, envy, torment), Sadness (suffering, sadness, disappointment, shame, neglect, sympathy), Fear (horror, nervousness). Yes, it is a movie about a list."

","The best animation ever. I love this film. Talks about a serious topic in a fun way."
"RemusGrey","10","27","71","24 October 2015"," Inside Out visualizes on an emotional journey
","Inside Out is kind of like a coming-of-age story, but told from a very different perspective. It starts by introducing us to the emotions inside the head of Riley, a little girl from Minnesota. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear run things in headquarters, taking turns at the controls of Riley. Joy mostly gets to run things, though, Riley amassing a huge collection of happy memories. But things are thrown into turmoil when Riley's family moves to San Francisco. Things go awry at headquarters, which results in Joy, Sadness and Riley's most important core memories being thrown out.<br/><br/>The film then cuts between Joy trying to make her way back to headquarters and the three remaining emotions trying to run things in her absence. This story takes some very abstract concepts and turns them into a grand adventure. It turns a little girl's psyche into a colorful landscape populated with figments of imagination and a working class devoted to keeping things together. The film is exactly what Pixar is all about, delivering a brightly-lit narrative that is unafraid to get melancholy. It is a story about embracing all our feelings, even the ones that don't feel too good.<br/><br/>The nuts and bolts of the plot take a very familiar form, with a pair of mismatched characters racing against time to get to somewhere important. This is basically the setup of eighty percent of all children's films. But Inside Out takes this basic framework to stranger places. This is a story that mostly works within the realm of metaphor, the locations representative of the inner workings of the mind. The film creates landscapes that stand in for the complex mechanics of personality and memory, finding interesting ways to represent an emotional journey.<br/><br/>And so the characters are ride a train of thought and go to where dreams are produced. And the emotions assert themselves at different intervals, and we see the effect in Riley in the real world. It's really clever stuff. The things happening outside drive the action inside, but the movie makes it appear that it's the other way around. The journey within is purely representational, the anthropomorphized emotions a really ingenious means of showing the growth of this one person. All of it is done beautifully, with lively visuals and a willingness to explore tragedy within the context of a children's cartoon.<br/><br/>There's a wealth of imagination in these images. There would have to be, given the subject matter. But the world inside Riley's head is a joy to behold. And when we get glimpses into the heads of other people, the differing design sensibilities do a lot to enrich the milieu of this particular world. The voice acting is top notch, with Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith bringing a lot of personality into roles that are specifically written to be representative of a single emotion. Lewis Black, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are also delightful in much simpler, more outwardly comedic roles.<br/><br/>Inside Out is exactly what Pixar is all about. For years now, the company has been telling children's stories that are much more willing to get emotionally complex. This film features the same kind of thinking that allowed for the depiction of tragedy in the first ten minutes of Up, and the quiet acceptance of fate in Toy Story 3. This is a film that is about that specifically, about the capacity of young people to take the bad with the good, the capacity to understand that there is more to sadness than just being sad. It's a simple, yet beautiful truth that doesn't get explored nearly enough.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Oh, and tell this lesson being taught to your kids: You can't have the same emotion for the rest of your life. Too much of everything can lead to something terrible, and too much joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear is bad too. If you are having a problem, you can talk to your parents about it. You have to open up to them so that they can solve your problems."

"ascribenz","5","26","68","30 June 2015"," Great premise, fails to deliver
","Having loved the Toy Story franchise and Wall-E in particular, I expect Pixar movies to be highly entertaining, with moments of complex emotional brilliance. So when everyone began raving about this latest release, which aimed to take animated children's movies to totally new depths, I was really looking forward to it. And it DID reach new depths - just not in a good way.<br/><br/>My first issue is that I wasn't emotionally - aha - invested in any of the characters. Riley to begin with seemed just a little too perfect, thanks to Joy being at the controls. And of course, the emotions themselves are entirely one-dimensional. Joy's goal, of keeping Riley happy all the time, just isn't emotionally rounded and gripping in the way Woody's fear of replacement and jealousy of Buzz, or Wall-E's loneliness and longing for Eve, are. Because of that, I found it really hard to care about the stakes, basically that Riley would ""get sad"" and argue with her parents. That this would upset Joy in turn didn't bother me at all - everything freaked Joy out. She was basically a flatter, passive-aggressive version of Marlin from Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>I also found it disappointing that Riley NEVER fought her emotions. The story treated humans as hollow shells being manipulated solely by their feelings. The message seemed to be that ""hey kids, it's not your fault how you deal with problems, it's the little person in your head"". I thought the story would develop the idea that it's learning to deal with your emotions - whether you let Anger press your buttons or not - that makes you mature as a person, but this wasn't the case at all. I agree with the poster who said Bing Bong is a bit Jar-Jar Binks, although I actually found him the most emotionally developed character of the lot. At least in his case you felt the stakes were reasonably high. <br/><br/>Finally, the plot was all over the place, focusing on the cleverness of developing little islands and cool tech without really building tension. The repetitiveness meant momentum was constantly lost. I'm not saying all kids' movies need a proper villain, but it would certainly have helped the story in this case. The humour and ""entertainment factor"" you expect from a kid's film was also totally lacking - I actually think this would really bore younger kids. I've still given the film 5 stars, because I thought the idea was a good one, and the voice acting was good. But frankly, as far as kids' films with a message go, it gets the pants kicked off it by Wall-E and Wreck-It Ralph. In terms of entertainment value, it's just lucky it shares its release with Minions, because only that absolute yellow turd can make this one look sharp by comparison."

","I went into this movie not knowing it's premise or anything really, I knew it was Pixar, so figured it would be pretty good. Needless to say it was a great movie. I found the whole concept to be interesting and different, like one of those, ""huh, that's a pretty cool idea"" moments.<br/><br/>It was done well, great visuals as usual from Pixar, and plenty of genuinely funny moments. I actually gave a damn about the characters in the movie, which was surprising as it is a kids movie after all and I am 36! Still I found myself thoroughly entertained, and would definitely watch it again.<br/><br/>Another one for the collection? Maybe so, I don't think it's up there with Toy Story, but I think its one of the better movies Pixar have put out for a while."
"cainefh","5","24","62","30 August 2015"," Disappointing
","***SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>As always I had high expectations for this movie, since it's a Pixar movie. But for the first time ever, I was pretty disappointed. The movie is so predictable, and the characters lack any depth. Now I know they are made to very one-dimensional, since it fits the story, but usually, it's only one maybe two characters that lacks any depth. This time I think they were all pretty uninteresting.<br/><br/>Pixar is usually able to make a movie that has something for all age groups. Toystory for instance. If you watch it at 6, you are going to have a hole other experiences, if you watch it again at age 18 and again at 30 etc.. <br/><br/>The main character is a young girl, and it revolves around her, and of course makes it hard to make any really good grown up jokes, since they have to be careful, because of her age. But the people in her head is a reflection of her, and since she is supposed to be a young girl, they are pretty one-sided too. But even the grown ups, ""headpeople"" are very one-dimensional and you don't really worry or care about any of them at any point.<br/><br/>It completely ruins the possibilities to write an immersive story, at least if you are above 18 years old, you'd probably have a hard time relating or at least find them a bit interesting. So if you are 18 and above, I don't think you'll like it. Will children like it than? Honestly no, I don't think so. I think the story is too complicated for really young children, but the visuals are nice as always, you just expect more, than a 1980s demo, from Pixar. The jokes are old and you see them coming from a mile away. Ofc the dad, thinks about sports at dinner table and pays no attention to the conversation, he would have too. <br/><br/>It's just like they picked the easy solution, every time in this movie and really didn't give it much thought. Maybe it's just Pixar that starts repeating themselves and it really shows in this movie, it was like I kinda had seen it all before in another Pixar movie."
"bonekeep","9","23","59","22 June 2015"," Deserves its place with other Pixar classics...
","It's tempting to name the Oscar winner in Animated Feature Film for this year (2015) already, because Inside Out is going to be tough to beat! From the same writer/director, Pete Docter of Pixar classics such as Toy Story (all of them), Monster's Inc, and Up, Inside Out figured to be another great one and surely delivered. The story is of a girl named Riley who's emotions help guide her from birth to the point at which her life is uprooted by a move away from her home town. Those emotions - joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger - are terrifically voiced by the likes of Amy Poehler (SNL), Phyllis Smith (The Office), Bill Hader (SNL), Mindy Kaling (The Office), and Lewis Black (Stand-up comic). The animation is glorious, and I feel like I need to see this movie a half dozen more times to be able to take it all in. Add to that an interesting and convincingly complex story line that conceptualizes memories, dreams, the sub conscience, and such in very clever ways. I think the story itself is too complicated for a younger audience, but like many Pixar films, part of the magic is being able to entertain audiences of all levels, even when the story is geared for a more mature audience (think WALL-E, which Pete Docter also wrote). This film doesn't quite have the emotional impact or laughs of a Monster's, Inc., or Toy Story 3 (my personal favorite), but it surely has its tender moments with plenty of funny stuff. That, along with a lively, clever plot and eye candy galore, makes Inside Out a definite must see."
"shadowyx12","8","23","59","21 June 2015"," Don't turn your back on Pixar just yet.
","THE SHORT OF IT: While watching 'Inside Out', I came to the realization that the film contains common plot elements seen in past Pixar films (especially Docter's previous two films). If you've seen 'Monsters Inc.' and 'Up', then you'll eventually see that this film is just a rehash of those two films combined. However, some people say that Pixar's latest offering stole its concept from an obscure '90s sitcom called 'Herman's Head'. And some even say that this film is a complete rip-off of the 2009 Japanese manga 'Nounai Poison Berry' (and its live-action adaptation that also came out this year).<br/><br/>For those people (and to myself), I just want to say one thing: deal with it. Like Picasso said, ""Good artists copy, great artists steal."" <br/><br/>And Pixar did a great job stealing this idea and making it their own.<br/><br/>With that being said, 'Inside Out' is still wildly original, universally relatable, and incredibly moving. The animation is beautiful as always, the story is well paced, and there are very few moments where the humour feels strange and off-putting (there's also a joke for you 'Chinatown' fans out there). Don't feel like you need to bring a little kid with you just to see this film – Pixar has proved time and time again in the past that they are some of Hollywood's best storytellers and has done so yet again with 'Inside Out'.<br/><br/>This truly stands as one of the BEST 'coming-of-age (or puberty)' films that has been released in the past five years.<br/><br/>P.S. Those with kids younger than nine should probably be warned that this film does get pretty dark (for a kid's movie) at the 2/3rd mark."

","Although I am not a trained professional by any means, I have done quite a bit of research into the way the brain works....from how core memories are formed to how the brain retrieves and replays them them to what role emotions play in all of it and control how we act and react. All I can say is this movie is spot on from that perspective and presents it all in a visually exciting and emotional ride. Definitely way over most children's heads, but in reality, if most folks understood some of this early in life, the world would be a much safer and happier place.

","As a big fan of cartoon movies, and a loyalty fan of Pixar, I usually don't have very high expectation of cartoon as opposed to other movies as long as it makes sense, tells a story, and maybe have some fun and make us think about life or sort of things. I feel very disappointed about this particular Pixar movie because a lot of parts didn't make sense to me--who have 2 degrees in psychology major.<br/><br/>The concept was so good, but very complicated. My brain kept running thinking about how each element in Riley's brain interacts with each other and outside world, and what their behaviors mean and I did find a lot of stuff didn't make sense to me. For example, when one personality collapsed, why it would bring down the thought of train as well? Why Riley's imagined boyfriend got duplicated and what did it even mean in a real human brain? It may be just too complicated to start with, so the movie ended with still confusing psychological terms and no real story except Riley left hometown, trying to be joyful but actually very sad (joy tries to take charge while sad cannot help stepping out).<br/><br/>Besides that, this movie doesn't have much fun and in fact is quite sad towards the end. It didn't make me think about life or anything except psychology theories. I am not sure whether kids would get any fun or learn anything from this movie and whether adults can enjoy. The little Pixar fan person in my mind was trying to take charge and let me love this movie, but the little real movie judge made the final call if you understand what I mean by that.<br/><br/>Additional note, I think the female volcano is very creepy, and I don't like it either."

","I think the screenwriter of this got inspired off of the 90's sitcom Herman's Head(1991-1994), I mean the similarities are there, but this movie is more kid friendly, where Herman's Head was more for adults.<br/><br/>I gotta say the animation is beyond terrific, I don't know but I'll bet it took a while, but it was worth it. And the voice acting is great also, I mean if you don't find the right voices, it's not gonna work, but they did find the right voices of these characters, the actors really bring them to life. This movie makes us think about the different emotions that go inside our heads. And the character traits of the voices, and what goes in the deepest part of our minds. It's an enjoyable film for the whole family."
"blakelogsdon1","8","21","54","21 June 2015"," People are talking to me in my head!!!
","The latest Pixar animated feature Inside Out is an innovative and creative new film that captures the hearts of both children and adults alike. The primary story takes place inside of the main character Riley's head as she undergoes the stressful transition of moving from her former home in Minnesota to her new one in San Francisco, California. Five emotions - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust - act as principal characters in the film and live inside the young girl's mind. These feelings strive to help Riley adjust to her new life in the Golden State as she leaves her old home and friends behind.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed this movie because it provided me with realizations about my own mind. As one might deduce from reading my title summary, people talk to me in my head all the time. In all, there are about nine different voices communicating to me on a regular basis. They often tell me to do things. These are things I sometimes might not want to do, but they make me do these things anyways. I have been told to urinate in public fountains, murder neighborhood cats, have sex with neighborhood cats, and even go see the Entourage movie. (Gasp!) I know, it's horrible. But my willpower means nothing to the bullies that live inside of my mind. <br/><br/>I have actually named all of the different personalities that occupy my brain. The cast of unwelcome assailants includes what I call the following: The Butcher, Satan's Little Minion, The Lunchlady, The Catholic Schoolgirl Slut, Larry Bird, the Dark Lord, My Stepdad Bruce, and Bill Cosby (not the lovable TV dad, but the alleged rapist). These nine characters take over my mind every single day and inform me to plan and execute evil deeds against society. It is only a matter of time before I do something extreme... and perhaps deadly...<br/><br/>The reason I love the Pixar movie Inside Out so much is because it lets me know that there's nothing wrong with having people live inside of your mind. My family has been trying to make me seek mental help for months now, but this film just ensured me that I am perfect exactly the way I am. The characters talking to me in my head are only trying to help. They know what's best for me. That's why sometimes they take away my will to act against them when I don't agree with their ideas. It's all for my own good. The thought that if I hadn't have seen this stellar animated feature I might have gone to see a mental health professional about my so-called ""problems"" is scary. Thank you, Pixar, for helping me understand that there's nothing wrong with me and any money spent on one of those quack psychiatrists would have been a complete waste. <br/><br/>Sincerely, Your fellow IMDb user blakelogsdon1"

","Depressing, bleak, boring. Characters are brainless and repetitively make the same mistakes. Couldn't wait for the movie to end which is something I never say about Pixar movies."
"jakobgf-95","5","25","67","18 September 2015"," Great for children, but nothing more.
","Now, if you are not completely brainless, you should know that 5 is the middle between 1 and 10 and therefore can tell that i'm NOT rating this Movie below average. The reason i'm writing this before my actual review is that there are a lot of people who do not understand this simple system and think that 7 is average and everything below that is below average. I want you to keep in mind that i don't think that this is a bad movie only because i'm not stuck in Pixar's butt.<br/><br/>Personally, i really like Pixar, or rather everything they did before ""Up"" with the exception of ""Cars"", and think the main reason they failed to impress me for the past seven years is Disney itself because the people who run things there are so desperate to make money by this point, that they even started ruining their own classics and do not allow anyone who works for them to be a little bit different because otherwise there would be the possibility to earn a bit less cash.<br/><br/>Of course this influences every studio that Disney owns, not just Pixar. <br/><br/>So ""Inside out"" is the newest unoriginality to come out of this production line and of course everyone praises it to the point where i actually went to see it even dough i didn't care about it in the slightest.<br/><br/>From the trailer, that i personally really liked and not only because it didn't give much away about the actual plot, but i also did find it very funny, i could tell that this would be an enjoyable movie for kids but for some reason i was sure that the jokes used in the trailer where the best ones of the whole movie. Not surprisingly, but sadly, i was almost completely right. There is one other joke that i really loved and one that had the potential to be great but it became to greedy and thus ruining itself. The rest of the humor isn't really my taste but, again, i think that kids will have a good time watching this.<br/><br/>The film marketed itself with it's huge load of originality but, as briefly mentioned before, i do not think that is the case. Nearly everything about this film, the concept, the themes, the characters, the sequence of events, almost everything has been done before. But to give credit where credit is due, this is probably one of the better films with this kind of concept.<br/><br/>But of course it isn't all bad. There are a few things that i think are creative, for example the way dreams are created, and there is nothing in the whole film that i would describe as bad with the exception of the characters. <br/><br/>Basically, we have our human characters who have no personality themselves because they are controlled by other characters who are extremely cut and paste and boring because all of them have only one character trade. Luckily this doesn't count for our main character Joy, but that doesn't mean that she is a good character. That only means the she is the only character who is at least a tiny bit relate-able, but not enough for me to care about her.<br/><br/>There are also a million tiny things that don't make any sense like: <br/><br/> Why is sadness so stupid at the beginning?<br/><br/> Why can she change the emotion of a memory and others can't?<br/><br/> Why has every human being only five emotions?<br/><br/> Why do the emotions in other brains all have the same gender and identical hair and in the girls head the genders and hair are different?<br/><br/> Why are the emotions sometimes talking about the girl as if she is a different person who is controlled by them, and sometimes like they are all one and the same?<br/><br/> Why does she forget how to play Hockey only because her emotions are messed up?<br/><br/> Does that also mean she has forgotten almost her entire life near the end?<br/><br/> Why can't they make her feel any emotions at that point?<br/><br/> And doesn't anyone think it's stupid how they change her emotions instantly, multiple times during specific events? Main example being the scene where the girl slides down a stair railing.<br/><br/>As you can see, i have a few problems with the movie. If you think that i shouldn't be so harsh on it because it's a kid's movie, than you also imply that every kid's movie, no matter how bad it is, should be forgiven for it's mistakes because it's made for children. And i think this movie is great for children but for people with a more developed brain, the mistakes a more than present. And because of that i can't give it a better rating. I would probably give it a 6 if the characters weren't so bad but the mistakes compensate the good things and therefore it is completely average for me."

","I saw this movie expecting something totally different. Yes, I was expecting the ""I'm going through puberty"" aspect of the movie, but there was so much more than JUST a kid going through puberty.<br/><br/>This movie featured a little girl named Riley, who is 11. Not focuses more on Riley's thoughts and emotions, however. As you progress through the movie, you see how Riley has grown over the years.<br/><br/>This isn't just a movie about going through puberty and experiencing mood swings. This movie is about growing up, and transitioning from a happy little toddler, to a maturing teenager. It also teaches kids that it's okay to be sad. Because that sadness won't last forever. Eventually, you'll learn to accept, and even enjoy, a huge change in your life.<br/><br/>I recently moved to an entirely different state, so this movie really hit home for me and my family. I couldn't help watching this movie, and thinking about my own life. In the end, I realized that nothing is bad forever. Things change. We experience new things everyday. That's just life. This movie did an amazing job of showing that, crammed together with some hilarious jokes, and some moments that definitely made me cry - not just tear up! Tears were rolling down my cheeks. And I guarantee you'll experience the same feelings. Unless you're a heartless, emotionless robot, with no tear-ducts. <br/><br/>10/10 Would recommend to ANYONE. (Yes, even those with depression.

It's definitely not amazing, but it's definitely not ""the worst"" either. Those who say it's one of the two are exaggerating. <br/><br/>Personally, I think it's mediocre. It has some fun, interesting elements to it, and the concept is original. It starts out quite interesting, the beginning is the best part, but the rest is not as good. It relies heavily on clichés, and none of the characters feel original. None of them develop much either, not even the main character, they're predictable and quite boring. Actually, you don't really get to know them, not even Riley, which is pretty ridiculous considering the movie is set inside her head. The parts that are supposed to make you laugh only make you smile awkwardly, because they're so cliché. There is no ""wow factor"", and the ending was predictable. Definitely not what I would expect from Pixar.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from watching it though, as some may enjoy it, but people probably shouldn't get their hopes up."
"diac228","9","21","55","3 July 2015"," Inventive, Engaging, and Funny, Inside Out has the Peak-Pixar Flavor We Haven't Seen in Years
","20 years in the film business, Pixar has given us masterpiece after masterpiece even if its best days are probably behind them. They know how to toy with your emotions, add depth to their characters, and best of all know how to deliver very unique stories in very unique perspectives. Director Pete Doctor's previous movie Up is a grandiose example of being an excellent film despite being far off the norm. Inside Out is no exception as it tackles a very complicated yet creative concept of exploring the emotions of a person while giving personalities to emotions---which is no easy task.<br/><br/>Inside Out being made into a feasible family movie is quite the accomplishment. Even if the deeper emotional moments and better jokes will be lost on the children, this film has something for everybody to see, from the visuals to the creative stylings of the human mind. Combine that with the perfect (Its honestly flawless) voice cast and a well-rounded script, you have Pixar's best since Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Joy (The perfect Amy Poehler) leads the cast as she attempts to dominate the mind of an 11-year-old and keep the other emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, and especially Sadness) in check---especially once the family relocates across the entire country. The conflict arises once Joy becomes unable to run Riley's emotions, leading to a lot of problems inside the mind and outside. Although Pixar runs in the Disney family and you secretly know how it will all pan out, the adventure and discoveries leading up to the inevitable conclusion is what keeps you engaged. There will be the classic Pixar mix of laughter, tears, and surprises throughout the quest to save Riley.<br/><br/>Establishing the universe is essential in movies like these, where environments carry its distinctive logic, its distinctive gravity. Inside Out starts out slow so it can mesh out the characters and give us a good idea as to how to approach the world of the mind. By the time you reach the dramatic conclusion, you would have witnessed Riley's imaginative world, her abstract world, her dream machine, as well as her biggest fears. The journey is far from predictable, as Inside Out explores a concept rarely executed (save for a 90s cartoon and a hilarious Spongebob bit).<br/><br/>Pixar has had a rough run lately, with delays and disappointing movies mixing together this decade. Inside Out is a step in the right direction thanks to a great script, delightful originality, and the great mix of great animation, laughs and heartfelt moments that we last experienced in the epic Pixar run of 2007-2010 (Ratatouille, Up, Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc.). It might be slower or more bizarre then what you are used to seeing in animation and blockbuster season, but this film is a fresh visual treat from start to finish."
"KnightsofNi11","9","20","52","3 July 2015"," Pixar is back!
","In the past few years, I'm not gonna lie, Pixar Studios have had some duds. They became far too comfortable on the sequel train that didn't require boundary pushing creative storytelling to make millions. Monsters University was a sore disappointment and don't even get me started on Cars 2. Now, they've finally decided to get off that train and return to their roots in telling incredibly clever and beautifully original stories, and they're quickly being reminded that this train makes lots of money, too. Inside Out takes us back to the Pixar heyday of films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and The Incredibles and reminds us why we fell in love with this studio, and why adults and children alike can enjoy the hell out of an animated movie made ""for kids."" <br/><br/>Pixar has always been playing with the idea of giving emotions to different creatures (toys, bugs, fish, etc.) and now they've gone Inception on us and given feelings to FEELINGS. Inside Out is the ultimate personification of what goes on in a person's head as they think and feel different things, having their decisions and actions fueled by the multitude of emotions swirling about in their brain. And by multitude I mean five because that's a workable amount of characters and voice actors to fill the core of your story.<br/><br/>Inside Out follows Riley, a girl from Minnesota who moves to San Francisco with her family. Inside her head lives Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger. These five personified emotions work together to keep Riley's mind in check in an elaborate and infinitely clever world full of personality islands, thought trains, imaginary friends lost in long term memory, and so many other brilliant representations of abstract concepts that exist in the human brain. Pixar has always had a knack for high concept world building, and they've outdone themselves here. <br/><br/>If you want a totally immersive experience within a world that is abstractly absurd yet also feels so real, then go see this movie. Inside Out builds a world and a system that is full of all the fantastical elements you would expect from an animated experience like this, but it is executed so well and the way thoughts and feelings are represented hits so close to home that after the movie you'll find yourself imagining what your little feeling characters are like in your own head. You'll find yourself thinking about what your own core memories are and what islands of personality they power. Inside Out represents growing up in a way we've never seen done before. It is a perfect way of making sense of all the different emotions we experience as we grow up and learn more about the world. I promise that you've never seen a coming of age story like this. I honestly don't know if I've ever experienced an animated film of this caliber that, while so fantastical and so extravagant, also feels so real. <br/><br/>The human brain is nothing more than billions and trillions of electrical synapses, but sometimes those synapses can create something beautiful, like this incredible personification of the mind that is adorable, funny, sentimental, and powerfully touching. I'm so thankful for the synapses working in the minds of those geniuses over at Pixar, because it has given us one of the most heartwarming films in a long, long time that is so universally relate-able I don't know how anybody couldn't enjoy it. I suppose if your Joy emotion were trapped somewhere in the halls of Long Term Memory that might be one way you wouldn't enjoy Inside Out, but hopefully she can catch the next Thought Train back to emotion headquarters soon. Yes, I believe I will be explaining mine and all other emotions through personified characters voiced by Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, and Lewis Black for a while now. This movie had an impact on me, for sure, in the best way possible."
"vidinty","5","34","97","21 June 2015"," Good Movie but not Original :(
","I really liked this movie, thinking how pixar has come back with a success film that is an original idea and not a sequel; but I felt disappointed when I read comments and saw videos on youtube that had previously used this concept; TV series ""herman's head"" and the Japanese movie ""Poison Berry in my Brain"". So not an Original Idea after all :( It's really sad how big studios are running out of ideas dramatically. We only now see superheroes 1,2,3 etc. sequels of everything, Copies of ideas from past movies or shows; they are really milking that cow for good. I don't know how much the public can swallow before they throw out. I can only hope is soon, because as long as they get the your ticket money they'll kept on going."
"Christopher_Reid","10","24","65","13 July 2015"," A beautiful, touching and insightful film
","Inside Out takes us inside the mind of a young girl as she grows up and goes through various changes and emotions. It's humorous, moving and thought-provoking. The concept is simple and a bit arbitrary - that our minds consist of 5 primary emotions that take turns directing our actions. But this idea is really just a starting point for countless observations about the many subtleties of human emotion.<br/><br/>The movie is ripe for deeper interpretations. I feel like anyone learning psychology could draw upon so many helpful analogies via this film. The way we store old memories, forget things, remember random things, alternate quickly between different emotions, change as we grow up, develop moral values, etc. Inside Out visualises these things in ways which are often funny but also abstractly seem to make perfect sense.<br/><br/>There are many parallels to another masterpiece, Inception. Both films delve into the inner workings of the human mind. The ideas they present are deeply original and profound. They have universal relevance because the scene of the action is perhaps the only thing absolutely everyone has in common (a mind of course). In fact, it's a concept we often seem to forget or skim over. That great mystery of who we are, what we are, what exactly are thoughts and feelings and what defines who we truly are? Do we love ourselves? Do we even know ourselves? Modern society seems to focus exclusively on the external world, forgetting that we ""exist"" and carry a world within our own minds. In both movies, our hero confronts something within themselves and grows as a result.<br/><br/>Monster's, Inc. was full of jokes specific to the world it had created and so is Inside Out. The writers clearly had fun adding all the little details. I'm confident that Inside Out will only grow in comedic value with each viewing. The characters are true to themselves and the movie never stops for the sake of a gag. The comedy naturally flows out of what's happening.<br/><br/>I was deeply moved by this movie. Its story is far more tragic and deeply sad than the colours and humour make it seem. It's about a child's world gradually falling apart. And yet somewhere in her subconscious, she desperately tries to find happiness again. It strips humanity down to its most basic level. Our truest, most personal feelings that we are sometimes afraid to acknowledge or accept. Everyone has felt what she feels. And any adult will understand the frightening possibilities that are alluded to and how differently things could have turned out.<br/><br/>I feel I've learned new things about life and human emotions. Sometimes the distinction between happiness and sadness can become blurred. We can't always have control of our emotions (but perhaps we can choose how to handle them). The way we feel about the past can change unexpectedly. Healing can sometimes be scary and painful but worth it. It may be better to accept how we feel than to act tough and become something we're not. We're usually more loved than we realise. Our experiences can shape who we are. Often when we grow, we lose things but gain richer things. We can create a moment of joy out of an unpleasant situation. People often walk away from things with completely different ideas of what just happened. These might not all be amazing revelations, but they are presented here so poetically that your perspective is refreshed.<br/><br/>The film-making is of such a high calibre that the entire focus is on the story and the experience. I don't want to write about the voice-acting or animation or effects or script or music because I didn't notice any of it. But I guess that really just means they were all excellent. I never had a chance to complain because I was completely engaged. We see what we're meant to see and feel what we're meant to feel. Pixar appears to be full of talented and passionate film-makers and it shows with all of their movies. Inside Out pulls at our heartstrings and opens our eyes like it's no big deal. This is a true work of art worthy of admiration and wholehearted enjoyment."

I know animated films are typically aimed towards small children, but I believe this movie benefits teens and adults just as much or even more than it does children."

","What a wonderfully original idea. I can't imagine there having been anything like this before. It might have been a motion picture, or a short, or an episode of a television series, or a television mini-series, or even a full-blown comedic television series. Who knows? If it had been produced, it might have been on the air between 1991 and 1994. It might have been a live action series rather than an animated cartoon or computer generated imagery animation. It might have been about a male character with people in his head representing his thoughts, moods, emotions, or personalities, instead of a female character. Just to be sure it would not have been a complete copy, it might have had a completely different title. Like ""Herman's Head"". Just to be sure I completely made all of this up, feel free to look that title up in IMDb."

It shows how every emotion is important to our life. So I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie which teaches us love, real love."

","This is one of the greatest animated movies I've seen. It's amazing how you can teach so much to your audiences by making it fun, colorful and meaningful. Kids love it because the characters are fun to watch and they may relate to them. Teens can relate just so much because they can be facing those kind of situations themselves as they grow and start to ""change"" not just moving away. Adults also can learn from that. I think adults can learn so much more than kids and teens because they've been through those things and they can learn from their mistakes and they also can teach their kids so much more many things in such an easier way. With kindness, happiness and patience everything is achievable."

","Beautiful idea, very well executed. This movie is clearly an Oscar contender this year, and I would say it is a lock for Best Animation Movie, and I think it will have some other nominations (possible Best Motion Picture of the year) We just had a proof that Disney and Pixar work great in collaboration and can create amazing stuff together. I always loved to read about psychology, so when I heard that Disney and Pixar released a movie about the mind I was super excited to watch it. It was even better when I saw the reviews on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. This is a must see for all the family. I almost cried in the end of the movie. I consider this to be an almost perfect movie. The only thing that I think it failed was the Bing Bong storyline. I think it would be nice if Joy made Riley remember about Bing Bong, cause he was kind of forgotten in the end."

","Flaws notwithstanding, Inside Out is a capitalist's perverse dream come true -- however his dream manifests outside of his subconscious is commendable within itself. It's a highly-anticipated film put out by the biggest animation studio in the world, packed with enough goofy jokes to satisfy children and enough reliably maudlin manipulation in the form of homogenized adolescence to please adults. The concept explodes with novelty and the animation is brilliant. And best of all, its main characters all come in fuzzy, furry, huggable forms that will no doubt sell mountains upon mountains of stuffed animals and other such material detritus until the faces of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear are plastered by fingerpaint-stained hands onto the pages of the haplessly constructed book of icons and dank memes (""o sh_t waddup"").<br/><br/>Inside Out is blatantly artificial. The film is mired in concept and marketability, sacrificing a solid narrative - which Pixar usually promises - as a result."

","Inside Out (2015) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Eleven-year-old Riley has a wonderfully fun childhood thanks to the emotions working inside of her. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) all help keep the young girl moving forward but when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransisco it throws everyone for a loop and soon Joy and Sadness find themselves lost in her system and trying to find their way back.<br/><br/>INSIDE OUT is certainly another winner from Pixar who are clearly the experts of the family movie. What really amazes me about the studio is that they're actually just making adult movies that kids happen to enjoy because of the pretty characters on the screen. I say this because films like this one, UP and WALL-E really do have adult stories dealing with adult issues yet somehow the studios are able to keep kids entertained while their parents get a lot more of the jokes and the emotions that the story provides. This one here is an incredibly touching story from a parent's point of view simply because of the changes that their kids go through.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the animation is the star of this picture and we're really treated to some wonderful images. I especially loved the use of colors in the picture and how various colors had a certain emotion attached to it. This is certainly excellent once our adventure begins as there's a ""long term memory"" section where these wonderful color marble like things are collection. Just the site of this are a true treat for the eyes. All of the ""emotion"" characters are perfectly brought to life with both Joy and Anger really standing out. The human characters are also quite entertaining and there's no doubt that the Bing Bong character will go down as a favorite decades from now.<br/><br/>As I said, this film is going to work a lot better for older kids and adults as I'm sure the majority of young children aren't fully going to grasp the idea of emotions and how they effect our lives. The story itself is quite charming throughout and I was surprised at how many adult issues they were able to work on throughout the running time. Fans of Pixar are certainly going to love this as it's another winner that manages to work no matter what your age is. Still, I think the older you are the more you'll enjoy it."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","23","63","24 July 2015"," Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and one of their finest overall
","Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.<br/><br/>Pixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up.<br/><br/>A superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily.<br/><br/>Loved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate.<br/><br/>Overall, a masterful return to form for Pixar. It's their best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","A big claim, yes. But for me, personally, I'm not sure I can fault this movie, or think of any better.<br/><br/>I am 50, and have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. Over the years I have tried all sorts of treatments, and read a lot about the condition, including actually studying clinical psychology, in my quest to better understand the demons that plagued me. <br/><br/>Never have I come across a better depiction or description of the depressive condition as I have experienced it, than is contained in this film. It explains the darkness in a light way that enables me to see the truths it contains without the feeling of horror that I usually feel when encountering any such depiction in fiction, and has a message that is not only hopeful but practical.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend it too highly for anyone with similar problems, or for people who know depressives and want a bit of insight. It is no exaggeration to say that this film has changed, possibly saved, my life. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if it's really for kids, though."

","I would have to say this is one of the best, if not the best, animated films I have ever seen. Congrats to the directors because the movie was able to summon all sorts of emotions in me with just its atmosphere. It looks perfect. Characters are well designed and very fun. The world inside Riley's head looks beautiful. The film is as interesting as it could get. Not for a second will you think this could be a little more fun. What can you expect from such brilliant directors? Animations, as always in Pixar films, were amazing.<br/><br/>Let's talk a little about what is going on in the film and the screenplay. I'm guessing you all had that thought that there is something in your head controlling you...some people, little versions of you or whatever. Writers managed to show it perfectly. Like they had imagination of a child and intelligence of an adult. There is a high chance that you will find yourself in the movie. You will remember what it was like to be a child and you will see how you lost some fun memories, how they faded over time. You will see how you changed and how your thinking has changed. You will be sad at one point when you realize what you lost in transaction from child to an adult. If you are a child you will connect to the film in the way that an adult cannot. The characters will get stuck in your head and you will be more playful then before you watched ""Inside Out"". One of the most important things is that this film carries a message...I will let you figure it out by yourselves while you're watching. Editing was great. It goes fluently from scene to scene, feels perfect. Music is also very good. Goes beautifully with emotions you get from the film. It kind of reminds me of the music from ""The Sims"" games. Anyway...<br/><br/>Great film. Recommended for people of all ages. If you haven't seen it already I don't know what are you waiting for. Go watch it now!"

"drewthedude","10","20","54","4 July 2015"," Inside Out puts Pixar back on the Map!
","I'm a very big fan of Pixar. It's probably one of my favorite animation studios of all time, besides Studio Ghibli. So when I heard that the first reviews of Inside Out were very positive, I got really excited knowing that Pixar has finally made another great film! I was especially excited by this news because I think it's been quite a while since Pixar's last really good film, like I think the last Pixar film that I was really enthusiastic about was Toy Story 3. After that movie it's been a bit rough for the company; Cars 2 was a completely unnecessary sequel, Brave was not terrible but was still very disappointing and Monsters University was good but still far from Pixar's best work. However, now we have the critically acclaimed Inside Out. I got to say, it was very well done but would I put it up along with my all-time favorite Pixar films? Well, let's see.<br/><br/>First off, the emotions are very fun characters and the actors used for these characters were very well chosen because they all have the perfect voices for each character. These emotions are very funny at times and they work well with this film's heartwarming story. Speaking of which, the story is very clever and it even has some moments that may tug on your heartstrings. Pixar sure likes us to make us cry, apparently the First ten minutes of Up and the ending of Toy Story 3 wasn't enough for them. Some of the locations shown within the girl, Riley's, head are very clever as well. Pixar really did a good job with their research, some of the things Riley's brain does is pretty accurate...but in a fictional and cartoon like way. Also we do see inside some other character's heads as well, and that leads some very funny jokes.<br/><br/>Now as for flaws, I really can't think of anything in this film that was bad. However, I do feel like there was a little more potential with some of the elements they played around with in this film. I would've possibly liked to have seen some more emotion characters or maybe even more possible locations within the head, but that's just what I thought. Oh, and like I said we do get to see inside some other people's heads at a certain point, but that was only in like one or two parts of the movie. I kind of wished this aspect was played with more throughout the movie. Other then that, there was nothing this film had that I disliked.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside Out is an excellent film and probably one of Pixar's best films in quite a while. I know some people are going crazy calling this one of Pixar's best films ever made. I don't know if I would go that far, but it was still an excellent film. If your a parent who wants to take your kids to a good family film, then look no further than Pixar's newest film. I give it a 9 out of 10, but I may possibly raise it to a perfect 10 after a second viewing."

"rcolgan","9","20","55","15 September 2015"," Another Pixar Classic
","Do you ever look at someone and wonder, ""What is going on inside their head?"" Well, the reality is the answers pretty dull. It's just a big brain sending messages across your body to determine your actions. But in the minds of the creators at Pixar the answer has no limits, with every persons head containing a fully functioning world, where small beings create and store every idea and memory we have in life. And at the centre of this world is a control panel, similar to something like the deck of the Enterprise, which is controlled by our emotions that lead us through every decision we make in our lives. <br/><br/>Inside Out follows a girl named Riley (Katilyn Dias) and the five emotions that lead her every action- Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Riley's most important emotion that has shaped all of Riley's core memories that make her the person she is, Joy (Amy Pohler). They all care for Riley and one another like one big family, always looking to give Riley the best life she can have. This includes everything from remembering to avoid Broccoli to maintaining Riley's goofy attitude to remain her parents happy little girl. <br/><br/>But Riley is entering a difficult period in her life of great change. She is moving to a new home in San Francisco, leaving her friends behind, and her father has become too busy with work to look after her the way he used to. This causes the emotions to conflict on the best way to deal with it, with the ensuing chaos causing Joy and Sadness to get lost in the furthest reaches of Riley's mind and forcing them to go on a journey to return to the control room, or Riley might never be happy again. <br/><br/>In some ways the film is a nice reminder of how even after 20 years, Pixar has stuck to what made them so engaging to audiences to begin with. The journey that Joy and Sadness go on is a great buddy travel movie, that's in a similar vein to Buzz and Woody in 'Toy Story'. And just like 'Toy Story', Pixar has continued to remain focused on developing memorable characters that will help shape many childhoods, with the likes of Joy's energetic personality and simplistic but lovable design bound to stick in our heads the same way that Buzz Lightyear did when 'Toy Story' was first released. <br/><br/>But in other ways the film is a reminder to show how far both Pixar and CGI animation has come, with the worlds Pixar's movies take place in going from the constraints of a child's bedroom to creating an entire world within the mind of a child. And the world that they create is something truly special. Other films have taken place in a person's mind in the past with their own distinct styles, from the epic mind bending action of 'Inception' to the fragmenting chaos in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. But no other film has ever approached the inner workings of a mind with the same creativity as Pixar has. <br/><br/>The film includes as much as it could of developing how a mind works and what an 11 year old girl would be thinking about, incorporating it as either a great gag or as a way the world is designed to function. There's a literal train of thought that's able to carry memories across Riley's mind, a place called DÃ©jÃ  vu that keeps popping up, and even a dream centre that operates like a movie studio to give Riley something to watch at night. Even small sayings like getting a song stuck in your head are incorporated in to the film in some of Pixars funniest running gags to date. Plus I'm relatively certain that anyone who's seen the film will be humming Triple Dent Gum for the rest of their lives. <br/><br/>As always, at the films heart remains the human drama that has kept Pixar movies so relatable over the years. In one of the most touching scenes, we watch as Joy turns on one of Riley's treasured childhood memories of her skating to pick up her spirits and slowly begins to skate with her in perfect synch. It's a beautiful moment where we're shown both the close bond that Riley and her emotions share, whilst reminding us all on the way we all hold on to out childhood in a way that only Pixar can.<br/><br/>It's moments like this that can be universally related to, mixed with Pixar's stunning animation and their ability to create such original worlds that ensures Inside Out is another addition to Pixar's constantly growing collection of treasured classics."

Not just for the story and the characters (which is without a doubt, brilliant), but also for the way it is told and what it all means. Using emotions as characters, Peter Docter (director and co-writer) has the complex world and interaction that is in each of our head.

If you pay attention you would be logically thrilled as well. It is like the inception of animation. Only simpler to understand yet intricate at so many levels!<br/><br/>This has to be placed amongst the greats. Not only is this movie extremely hilarious, it is also very dramatic, highly educative, and morally impeccable.<br/><br/>Taking up two big plots simultaneously in the vanguard was a Herculean task per se. But Pete Doctor and Ronaldo Del Carmen merge them just fine to weave an excellent coming-of-age story of Riley whose life decisions are technically controlled by voices in her head. We have Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust that literally define the head of our protagonist.<br/><br/>The concept is simply outstanding. Notions that define how we feel have been brought to life by Pixar's amazing animation and they look downright perfect. Thoughts, memories, imagination, sub-conscious every area of a human brain has been beautifully and subtly portrayed using humorous characters as props. Watch out for the adorable Bing Bong!<br/><br/>The drama is absolutely melting. So warm and so right that it beats every non-animated drama flick to pulp. The Bing Bong fate and the gloom of the memory dump are the most melodramatic bits in the movie that would uproot your heart away.<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino's music is simply amazing. The composition is quite soothing. He stops playing his notes at dramatic bits for emphasis and then lightens up the mood, after the grim passes. Really thoughtful!<br/><br/>There are valued lessons strewn all across the movie that just feels so right, and have been exploited in the right amounts. Humour is always lurking around in the corner even in the direst of circumstances and you end up laughing every time. Amy Poehler's voice makes Joy, well you know, joyous. Phyllis Smith's voice as Sadness is quite endearing. Bill, Diane, Kyle and Richard just make everything better.<br/><br/>Oh and there is an amazing short called Lava that plays in the beginning!

Maybe that's just because the disgust in my head made me think that. How does my mind really work?<br/><br/>Inside Out is Pixar's latest film that takes you into the mind of a girl named Riley. In Riley's mind are five emotions. Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. They make Riley who she is.<br/><br/>Now going into this movie I feared that the movie wouldn't have much of a plot and that it might be annoying seeing it go back in forth between Riley's emotions and Riley herself. What I came to realize was that it was a perfect blend of all of it. I sat through in awe seeing the beautiful animations. This animation is just extremely beautiful seeing each character almost having a ton of detail to them. It isn't the best Pixar has done, but it is sure one of the best.<br/><br/>How do the jokes hold up in this movie? I found myself laughing out loud a ton of times. What amazed me was that there were kiddy jokes. They were all stuff I could relate to or that were truly funny and I was very surprised by that. The movie has a great adult feel to it with all of it's complexity. Even though it has complexity, all ages will love it. It has some truly great writing.<br/><br/>From what I have seen from reviews from people that this movie is slow at the beginning and a total depress fest movie and I would like to clear this up. He beginning of the movie is a bit slow. It has some funny stuff though that keeps it going, but it will go by pretty slow while it takes time to introduce everyone. As for depressing the movie handles itself quite well. There are two very sad parts that brought me to complete tears. I could hear people in the theatre crying and it was truly a sad part. Do I think it was too depressing? No, I don't. The movie takes the sad parts and mends itself. The message of the movie carries it along and if someone is going through depression and they see this. I think it is something that will bring tears to their eyes, but also bring realization to them about their life and where they are.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Inside Out yet then go see it ASAP.

","A girl named Riley Andersen is born in Minnesota and within her mind, five personifications of her basic emotionsâ€”Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Angerâ€”gradually come to life and influence her actions via a console in her mind's Headquarters. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important ""core memories"" (all of which are happy ones) are housed in a hub that powers ""islands"", each reflecting an aspect of her personality. In Headquarters, Joy acts as a de facto leader to maintain Riley's cheerful childhood, but since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness' purpose (not even Sadness herself), she frequently tries to keep Sadness away from the console.<br/><br/>At the age of eleven, Riley and her parents move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their belongings was misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory."

","One of the many mysteries of life is emotion, and the presence of a conscience in people. Inside Out is a much more fascinating exploration of these two abstract concepts than my Psychology 100 class was. Kaitlyn Dias voices Riley, an eleven-year-old girl who has just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco, much to her dismay. But the real stars of the show are her emotions: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kahling), and Anger (Lewis Black). These emotions live in Riley's headquarters, where Riley's core memories are kept â€” memories (notably all happy ones) that create Riley's ""islands"" of personalities. These islands and these core memories are the essence of Riley; they define her. The emotions, with the bubbly Joy being in the lead, are responsible for Riley's mental activity and the choices she makes. They also are responsible for processing memories, each memory having a definitive emotion attached to it. Before Riley's family moves, Joy and the other emotions are proud of the fact that they've kept practically every memory happy. The only emotion bothered by this is Sadness, who begins touching memories and Riley's thoughts, permanently turning them sadÂ…and ruining everything, according to Joy. In an effort to keep Sadness from making a core memory into a blue experience, Joy and Sadness fall out of headquarters. Now, the two adverse emotions must make their way back to the headquarters with the help of Bing Bong (Richard Kind), the imaginary friend from Riley's younger days. Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen (co-directors) invent a very unique story, one that appeals to children and adults. Kids are often mystified by what goes on in the minds of others, as are adults (despite whatever extensive knowledge we may have of cerebral activity). Docter and Del Carmen walk us through how traumatic events, such as moving to a strange place, can affect our emotions. In a particular scene from the film, Sadness is inexplicably drawn towards touching a memory and turning it sad. She can't help this urge; just as people are helpless against feeling down sometimes. The film really does show how negative feelings are uncontrollable and inevitable, a concept that may be hard to grasp for younger viewers.<br/><br/>Inside Out is filled with bright, eye-catching colors; the characters are depicted perfectly. Special recognition is due to Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith, the two bringing out the differences in their contrasting emotions. Joy is a golden-colored and energetic creature with a form reminding me of Tinker Bell. Poehler is perfect for this role, as she brings the bubbly can- do spirit that we all recognize from her character on Parks and Recreation. Sadness is depicted as a completely blue overweight figure. With her glasses and turtleneck sweater, Sadness is the image of the unpopular girl from middle school. Smith does a great job voicing Sadness, and brings out the emotion's perpetual pessimism. Together, Poehler and Smith are a likable duo. Hader, Black, and Kahling are the fudge, whipped cream, and cherry atop this fudge sundae of a cast. The voice actors all perform wonderfully off of one another. Hats off to the casting director!<br/><br/>The music in this film was great; however nothing revolutionary. The score comes from Michael Giacchino, who also did Up (2009). As he did for Up, Giacchino writes an endearing little musical motive that tugs on the heartstrings. I'm not sure that this score is destined for any awards, but it certainly was a great aspect of the film. Give the theme a listen!<br/><br/>I definitely enjoyed this movie, and I'll even admit to shedding a couple of tears during it. I can only find one flaw: the hype surrounding the film got in the way. I walked into the movie theatre expecting to be stricken with awe and amazement at this new Pixar flick, with all the rave reviews it had been getting. As often happens when this is the case, the movie seemed to fall just short of my expectations. Despite this little speedbump, Inside Out is a creative film worth seeing, not to mention an instant Pixar classic."
"MissSimonetta","9","18","49","22 June 2015"," The melancholy and joy in life
","One thing which fascinates me with the general Pixar output is the streak of melancholy in so many of their films: Woody and Buzz's awareness of the ephemeral nature of life, Mr. Incredible's mid-life crisis, Wall-E's post-apocalyptic world, and the loneliness of Carl Frederickson quickly spring to mind. Inside Out (2015) continues this tradition with its examination of the inherent melancholy in life.<br/><br/>The commercials and trailers show off the bright colors and sparkling comedy, but there is so much more beneath the candy colored surface. This is a story about the pain and alienation that comes with growing up. In a society where we want to push past unpleasant aspects of life without reflecting, where we want to rush as fast as possible, this film gives us an important lesson: sadness is necessary, grief is essential, and whenever we confront pain in our lives, we must not try to brave the path by ourselves. It's extraordinary and moving, proof that Pixar is back on track giving us modern classics and not tripe."

","I gave it a 5 because it wasn't awful. Maybe a 6 would be more fair, but only just barely. Maybe. The 5 is somewhat of a reaction to the almost 9 overall IMDb score. But i am more comfortable with 5, so I am sticking with it.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a good movie for kids. For adults, it is pretty lame. 5 emotions? C'mon, only a youngster is going to buy that, 'cause they don't know any better. And about the message, that if you want people to help you out, you have to going around moping, so they will see you are upset, and maybe help you out. That is a lame message, even for a toddler.<br/><br/>This movie is a very ordinary cartoon movie. I was really disappointed, and only got talked into seeing a kid's movie, because of the 9+ ratings on here at the time I went to see it a week ago."

","Pixar is back! And good as always. I'll just say, if you didn't already, go watch this movie!<br/><br/>Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.<br/><br/>After a lot of time (for me, since Toy Story 3) we got another awesome Pixar movie. The story is really, really good. I can easily say that this movie is for both, parents and children. For parents because it has something that kids won't understand, like growing up and stuff, but kinds will like jokes and funny moments. I was impressed because there are NO FART JOKES! Like in other new animated films, there is some humor that some kids won't understand.<br/><br/>The voice actors did great. Amy Poehler (Joy), Phyllis Smith (Sadness), Bill Hader (Fear) and Lewis Black (Anger). They were just awesome. There are not many clichÃ©s. Sound effects are good as well. Animations are just great. There is one scene when shelves with memories are falling, and after that I was being like:"" In your face, San Andreas!"" Trust me, that scene is brutal.<br/><br/>Pete Docter did a great job as well (writer and director). He is one of the best director and writer for animated movies. He is like... Awesome. He made Up, Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Wall-e. He is unstoppable!<br/><br/>Well, this movie is great, but it has only one sin and, of course, that are clichÃ©s. No movie is without them. I can easily say that we already have Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature Film Of The Year."

","In a fantastic world where people had five main characters in their heads which represent joy, fear, anger, disgust and sadness, a young girl is about to enter the darkest period of her short but lovely life. When she's forced to move with her parents to another home in San Francisco, Hope and Sadness get accidentally sent away from headquarters, leaving Fear, Anger and Disgust to take care of everything. This is the part when all begins to go wrong and only the two main feelings can help her, if they actually manage to get back to the place where they belong.<br/><br/>It's a very sentimental movie which presents the adventures of two characters as they try to find their way back through an endless maze filled with long-term memories. It's mostly sad and suspenseful, contrary to what I was expecting, briefly changing the mood from time to time with a funny sequence. I would have preferred a more joyful movie considering the premise it had, this way making it easier for everyone to enjoy. I had the impression I was watching a drama rather than a colorful and cheerful animation, which, by the way, was top notch as usual. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very good animation but pretty far away from the elite, unfortunately."
"MartinHafer","9","16","43","18 June 2015"," Aside from a few slow portions in the middle, a marvelous film from Disney.
","One important note: If you go see ""Inside Out"" be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, ""Lava"". It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like ""Inside Out"", its audience really is adults, not kids.<br/><br/>This film appears to have been inspired by a now defunct but wonderful exhibit at Epcot at Disney World. Cranium Command was a strange movie which featured lots of film clips and audio animatronics to embody the various emotions battling within a young boy. Here in ""Inside Out"", you have a group of entities that also embody the feelings...but in a young girl. When the film focuses on these five emotions, it's at its best---clever, fun and often sweet and tender. Unfortunately, the film loses its way a bit in the middle--and seems to have succumbed to some distractions. Fortunately, it finds its way very well at the end-- and ending which is incredibly satisfying and perhaps might require some Kleenex.<br/><br/>The film is incredibly well animated and I was impressed by the 3-D version as it used this technology well. Additionally, the story is nothing like any CGI film I've ever seen. My only reservation is that the story might be a bit difficult for children to understand and the plot seems much more for older kids, teens and, especially, adults."

","Animation movies are made, in my opinion, to make you feel good, to get a laugh out of you and to be entertained. This movie did none of it. The trailer made me want to watch this movie for some kind of reason. However, taking a look at it again after waiting for the movie to be over I wonder why. The humor is probably too difficult for children to understand and definitely too bad for adults. The two main characters (emotions) were also the two most annoying ones. Unlike some reviewers this movie didn't make me feel depressed, it just made me feel emotionally detached. The soundtrack didn't make up for the bad execution either, although the animation wasn't bad I guess even though it didn't appeal to me either. <br/><br/>Watched the Minions last week and it was so much more fun. This movie doesn't even come close to the Minions in terms of humor. This movie should not be mentioned in the same list as Finding Nemo, Toy Story 3, Monster Inc, the Incredibles and not even Ratatouille. The humor is poorly timed. It is as if the animated characters should get a lesson or two in acting. No original jokes whatsoever.<br/><br/>The idea is fun, although not original what I learned from the other reviews. I went and had a look at 'Hermans head' on YouTube and in only 2 minutes in that already made me laugh more than 'Inside out'. That's exactly what I recommend to people going to this movie. Get in the movie theater and then out immediately.<br/><br/>My lowest rating for a movie so far!"

","Nothing in the world is as powerful as emotions. Whatever we do, we do because we have emotions, either that be joy, sadness, fear, disgust or anger. These emotions are the key driving forces of our brain; our brains are controlled by them. Without one, the others can't continue on properly.<br/><br/>This simple thing about ourselves is portrayed very well in the movie by Pete Docter; it was quite emotional. The concept behind the movie touched my heart. It brought back the memories of my childhood. It reminded me how I used to think/feel as a child. I can't get them back now, but to some extent, this movie does the job. I'm a child once again. I can feel such strong emotions that make me laugh, or cry. The last time I felt the same was while watching 'Toy Story 3'. 'Inside Out' is simply one of the brilliant animated features by Pixar.<br/><br/>I waited a long time for this movie to be released.

Yes I understand we parents impact out children's lives and emotions, feelings, thoughts, perceptions and most importantly their lasting memories...which help defines their character & emotional state later in life. The parents are a reflection of their children and we must sacrifice ourselves at times so that our children feelings are taking into consideration.

We all laughed all the way through.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I wonder what people expect from a movie. Here we have an imaginative story line which truly gets into the mind of a young child with joy sadness fear anger and disgust.<br/><br/>Yes, the characters for Mother and Father are a little stereotyped and there are moments in the film when you could easily feel disappointed or depressed but those moments are short and overall the film holds the attention of the audience from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The storyline is simplistic and touching, nothing overly American about it, dealing with a child moving far away from home and looking at the problems she faces at home and at school in a fun and challenging way.<br/><br/>This is no doubt a film aimed at a mixed audience of parent and child and teenagers too might find the topic of interest when looking at those five basic emotions applied to themselves.<br/><br/>There are a lot of mediocre films about which fall well below the mark and not many in the category of family entertainment which are appealing across the generation divide. In my view, this one will appeal.<br/><br/>It was the weekend, the film was recommended to me. It was a perfectly good moral film with a sound storyline and easy to follow. I did not have to think too much on any of the issues raised in the film. Younger children would not grasp the point made in the morality stakes but who cares so long as everyone who goes to see the film can eat their popcorn in safety and have a few laughs?

This meant that I went in reasonably fresh and waiting to be entertained.<br/><br/>Granted the concept was fresh, granted there was plenty of invention but it was like they threw them in a tombola and spilled them out into the film without any judicious selectivity.<br/><br/>I remember watching the making of featurette for Big Hero 6 and they were discussing how Pixar don't really storyboard a film preferring it to have an organic growth. Now sometimes that can work but for Inside Out it certainly didn't.<br/><br/>It just felt like it was made by a large group of people throwing great ideas into the pot but no one then sifting through them to see how they worked in the film. It lacked a firm director to weed out and discard some of these ideas and concentrate on the forward drive of the film.<br/><br/>It needed someone to temper the proceedings so Joy didn't dominate the film so much. It needed someone to keep the film bouncing along without slowing down for the next great idea.<br/><br/>I was genuinely surprised to find myself bored halfway through and having to give contemplation to leaving when my GF suggested it.

The plot is very good, simple yet deep; the art in this movie is superb (a scene in particular I will not explain to avoid spoilers got me crazy for the characters design); a couple moments in the movie are really worth your tears. And the whole movie, is really worth watching. It's Disney and Pixar making a step further in the art of story telling, it's a great idea going visual.

Riley's story can be relatable to many people in the world but the message and emotions she goes through is relatable to everyone. We all experience happy, sad, fearful, anger and distraughting moments constantly through our lives and Pixar truly delivers on this film by showing why it's important to have all those moments in life as they help us grow as an individual and learn valuable lessons. It's incredible to see Pixar deliver their powerful life lesson through such creative way, which is something that has been lacking in their recent films but Inside Out puts Pixar back on the top mark.<br/><br/>It's absolutely brilliant and can be watched over and over again and feel something new every time you re watch it."
"Icedooitle","8","18","51","4 November 2015"," Deep, Inside and Out
","Of Pixar's 15 films there has been an unspoken promise made before you go to the theater, you will see something magical. If you have ever felt disappointed leaving a Pixar film it is usually because you had an expectation of greatness and had to settle for ""good."" Mind you, even ""good"" is a rare feat when heading to the theater. Inside Out, Pixar's latest venture, achieves greatness in a similar way to Wall-E, a high compliment. While maintaining a child friendly and beautiful atmosphere, there is a very dark undertone that children may not fully understand but will undoubtedly feel.<br/><br/>When Riley Anderson is forced to move from Minnesota to California with her family, a very familiar plot is set in motion. A child has to adapt to change at an uncomfortable pace, but will learn that the difficulty and discomfort is part of what makes an adventure an adventure. This usually happens when a wise or eccentric character provides the protagonist with some profound lesson that will come in handy to overcome the antagonist in the foreign environment. This is nothing like Inside Out. I might even argue that this film is without an antagonist. The way this story unfolds is something like Inception for children. This story is substantially easier to follow, but equally deep in possibilities and structure.<br/><br/>The other side of this story is set in the mind of Riley. Her emotions take on their own physical presence in a mental control center. These emotions are Joy (Amy Poheler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader), And Disgust (Mindy Kailing). From birth, Riley's life experiences are monitored and assigned a feeling by these characters. This is less a battle for control and more of a coworker dynamic, attempting to keep the brain power plant operating smoothly. The emotions function as a unit the same as countless other creatures that do the grunt-work of maintaining Riley's memories and her mental labyrinth of storage to organize them. The most compelling physical representations of Riley's mind take form in her core memories. All of these constructs are unique to her, as I doubt that everyone's core memories have a 25% section devoted to hockey. <br/><br/>The darkest undertone in this film is just what is at stake in the conflict. Other Pixar features may have life and death hanging in the balance, Inside Out holds an 11 year-old girl's personal identity and sanity over oblivion, literally! There are moments when the dark possibilities seem a little trivialized by the obligatory cuteness of the animated mind, but it does little rob adult viewers from imagining some truly heavy weight implications.<br/><br/>This may not be the best Pixar adventure. The voice cast is well chosen and ceaselessly entertaining, but the balance between the inside and out favored the inside a little too frequently. In hindsight this is a petty criticism, but the film is still in the company of some of the most monumental achievements in animation, holding its own.<br/><br/>On a side note, because this is a Pixar feature it is preceded by an animated short. This may be the best one yet. It would be criminal to spoil anything, so go in fresh and be delighted."
"static-25910","9","18","51","5 July 2015"," The most moving and funny Pixar film in a long time.
","Going into this film I really didn't know what to expect from it. The trailers had given me a basic idea of the plot, a girl and her emotions, but other than that I really had no idea what it would be about or how they could make 94 minutes of content with such a simple idea. However, having now watched the film I can look back on those thoughts and laugh at how wrong I was. Inside Out is just overflowing with brilliance, and I would honestly consider it to be in my top 3 Pixar movies, slowly creeping closer to my number one every passing day.<br/><br/>The basic plot follows an 11 year old girl called Riley who is going through a tough time as she is forced to move away from her home and set up a new life in a different state. We see how she feels about her situation through five personified emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger who make her feel certain emotions from a control panel in her brain. Joy tries her best to make Riley feel happy but due to her situation Sadness begins to have more of an affect on Riley's outlook. Joy and Sadness eventually get lost inside Riley's mind leaving the other three emotions to try and work things out themselves.<br/><br/>While the plot of the movie may seem a little simple it's actually extremely fun to see Joy and Sadness navigate their way through different parts of Riley's brain whether it be her imagination or her abstract thought, it makes every part of the movie seem new and exciting and overall makes the adventure all the more enjoyable. Every actor in the movie is absolutely spot on, particularly Bill Hader as Fear and Lewis Black as Anger, they all bring a certain charm to each individual emotion and their comedic timing makes the jokes hilarious and memorable.<br/><br/>Insides Out script is also extremely well written, the comedy is well timed, relevant and intelligent, making way for classic kids comedy as well as implementing old school laughs as well (There is even a Chinatown reference in this movie!) However, the real magic in this script is in its emotional themes. Pixar is not new to writing emotionally powerful scenes, but Inside Out takes it a step farther. The movie deals with growing up in an almost poetic way, showing how we let go of our childhood in our minds in order to accept the adult reality around us. The film shows how every kid feels when they realise it's time to grow up and how it can be difficult to let our childhood slip away but also necessary to let some of the more grown up things be a part of us, and ultimately make us a better person.<br/><br/>All in all, Inside Out is a step in the right direction for Pixar and movies as a whole. The acting is perfect, the script is genius, the animation is beautiful and the themes are powerful. If you see one movie this year make it Inside Out, you'll cry with laughter one minute then sob your eyes out the next. It may seem cheesy but this movie really is an emotional journey and by the end you will be thinking to yourself: ""I wonder what the emotions in MY head are like?"" I guarantee it."
"drawlife","9","18","51","29 June 2015"," A return to form for Pixar.
","This movie was a hard sell. I liked the first sneak peek of the preview of this film, but I wasn't really feeling the other trailers and the marketing campaign overall. But to it's credit this movie is a hard movie to sell without spoiling anything. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. I think Pixar found their groove back with Inside Out after misfires like Brave and the Cars franchise. But with that being said, what Pixar is great at is making movies, not just for kids, but for adults as well. The exterior of the films seem like for kids, but the interior has many layers and depth. <br/><br/>This film allows you to feel the emotions you see on screen, who are the emotions of a girl named Riley(Kaitlyn Dias). The whole cast is stellar, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler carries this film, I was very concerned if I can get on board with a character who is happy all the time throughout the whole film, but Poehler and her character manages to do so. Phyllis Smith is Sadness and she is terrific, I found her to be a tad annoying in the beginning, but she won me over. I liked the other supporting emotions, Mindy Kaling provides sassiness as Disgust and Lewis Black as Anger provides some humorous moments as well, but my favorite out of all is Bill Hader's Fear. He was great. The parents portrayed by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan provide decent supporting roles. <br/><br/>How the creative minds of Pixar came up with this conceptually complicated film is beyond me. Give director/writer Pete Docter, who also wrote Wall-E and Up, credit where credit is due. The story is almost perfectly constructed. I say almost, because the beginning starts off so well and it's thrilling, just to see the concept become realized in just a few minutes kicked the film off in high gear. What bogged the story down a little is when Joy and Sadness end up getting lost within the large maze of Riley's brain/memory trying to get back into the control room. That is where the film looses some momentum. I didn't particularly love Richard Kind's Bing Bong, but he was my least favorite character of the bunch, but he is used very effectively, and to those who saw it, you know what I'm talking about. It's just a tiny nitpick but I just wish they allowed the idea to carry the film itself rather than have this middle act, again it wasn't a huge detriment, just a nitpick as it eventually picks up steam again. <br/><br/>This is Pixar's most ambitious and most subtly intelligent film yet. Not since Toy Story 3 have I enjoyed a film this much by them. Again, I'm going to sound like a broken record, but Pixar really knows how to tell a story. Yes they do have some misfires, but their track record is solid. I'm not the target demographic for these films, but they continue to turn up solid, dependable, and consistent entertainment. <br/><br/>This film hits the right notes on another level. The conceptual level this film operates on is a pleasure to watch on screen. This movie is very thought-provoking and is filled with awesome and clever metaphors that never gets complicated at all. It explains emotional states very well disguised as a kid's film and sends a great message that not just that everyone has emotions, but it cannot be one emotion all the time and every time, and each emotion has it's place. It's an easy film to relate to, and to be honest I sincerely believe that adults might enjoy this film a little more than kids. Inside Out is easily in Pixar's top five or ten list. <br/><br/>9/10"
"marcin-piasta","10","19","55","19 July 2015"," A creative, surprsing, and fun film that adults will enjoy
","I have come to love Pixar movies because they are disguised as children's cartoons, but what I find time and again is the opposite, a deep and well thought-out story that strives to activate your sense of meaning and purpose (in fact, the children in the theatre seemed to be confused by the complexity and didn't get the good jokes). The fantastic, playful and realistic 3-d animation is just icing on a really delicious story.<br/><br/>In the case of Pixar's latest movie, we are challenged as a viewer to consider how our own emotions have impacted our childhood development and adult life experience. I find that the story team and director at Pixar did a phenomenal job at building a robust framework for understanding human emotion, and its impact on our decisions and behavior, in a simple illustrative process that even a child could understand. Seeing this framework come to life in animation gave substance to understanding our own emotions in a new way.<br/><br/>I had fun, laughs, and shed some tears too. The story is touching, an emotional journey. I love how unique Inside Out is compared to the same-old dribble being pumped-out by mainstream studios, which sell the same already-told stories repackaged with new actors. As expected from any Pixar movie, Inside Out allows one to escape from that mindless dribble for a moment, and enjoy the surprise that awaits with each scene. <br/><br/>Thank You Pixar, and keep up the great work! Never stop pushing the boundaries."

Disgust and anger and fear were also very well made, and featured very funny moments as they try to function when joy and sadness are missing. This movie really just leaves you more than satisfied. I was actually sad when it was over, that's when you know a movie is truly fantastic! 10/10 there wasn't a single flaw in the perfect movie! :)"

","""Inside-Out"" Review<br/><br/>Now allow me to start by saying this, when I was watching the previews for this film originally, I was saying to myself ""Oh god, another one of these."" I simply had no care, nor any intention of seeing it. BUT then I started hearing the reviews, about how simply amazing it was, and how everyone should take the time to see it. But even then, I was kind of ""Ehhhhh I don't know."" And then, my friend finally convinced me to see it. I didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>Now to wrap all of the ""Oh I was wrong"" and ""I regret thinking what I did of this movie"" and all that crap. Inside-Out is what of the most emotionally beautiful movies I have seen this year. It is a beautiful tale of an adolescent girl coming to terms with childhood depression. Frankly it has some of the best imagery of ANY movie I have ever seen. And let me tell youit gave me some serious feels.<br/><br/>One of the greatest approaches to this movie is how we see the emotions/the brain growing and learning as the characters age. From the moment where we are born to the moment where we die, we are constantly learning and adapting as we enter the different stages of our life. The ""Emotions"" as I am going to refer to them as, are learning as the characters grow. Which is a WONDERFUL symbolism for the brain developing.<br/><br/>I know that I have dealt with childhood depression, especially throughout my teenage years, and so seeing this simply incredibly imagery of this unfolding into a young girl gave me a sense of immersion. I was able to relate to it. And as I have said, I love it with I can immerse myself in with a scene or character (because I am weird like that).<br/><br/>The only problem I really dealt with is that it felt like it was going so quickly in the beginning to encounter the main problem and then it slowed down to a crawl. However, in some ways it felt necessary. Not only for the plot, but for the imagery of how depression feels. Depression makes you feel like the world has stopped. You shut down. And those emotions that have been eating away at you take over and start controlling every decision you make, even involuntarily. So, honestly, I can't give much negativity on the slowness of the movie, because that really is how it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie was incredible. It was beautiful, funny, emotional, and really everything it needed to be to get the point across and be a fun movie to watch at the same time. Definitely a movie to go and see for the summerregardless of how late this review has come out. Final Score: 9/10"

","This show is a great plot, first off. The characters and their situations are highly gifted. The art was the best.<br/><br/>The reason I give this show a 6 is because it seemed as tho there was not enough time for the strengths in the show to show off for longer periods of time. It seemed more like work. We were listening to statistics.<br/><br/>All in all, it means it was a good movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend this a ""good family movie.""

","What a terrific movie for the whole family. It gives very creative insight into emotions and memories. The construct of this movie is very clever and insightful. An emotional roller coaster of a film that is most definitely one of the best Disney / Pixar films of all time. This coming from someone who grew up with the Lion King, Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, etc. Aside from this film being a huge box office success and bringing me to tears multiple times I still find bad reviews on this website. The ""critics"" who are saying this movie is anything but phenomenal either didn't get enough hugs growing up or are simply here to disregard quality. There are no other movies like this one.

"billygoat1071","10","20","59","23 August 2015"," Internal Portrait of Growing Up
","Pixar returns to their high-concept roots with Inside Out, showing us how emotions work through the human mind in a whimsically metaphorical way. It's the kind of idea that Pixar would definitely take at some point as they have always been bringing us a variety of emotions in their films. This movie explores childhood and growing up into the perspective of a little girl's mind, how the emotions get confused by the changes in life and how they have to gain back the light. Inside Out represents this angst with a delightful, yet profound adventure; which indeed results to a totally heartwarming experience.<br/><br/>This concept explores emotions, personalities and imaginations of an individual, but the film's focus is an 11-year-old girl named Riley who moves to a new city with her family, but troubles to adapt and letting go. This made the emotions trying to avoid her from sadness, but instead lead her primal emotions to get lost somewhere that stores her long-term memory. And this does indicate the idea of being overly attached to the past, but also tells that growing up requires moving on and accepting whatever life would take you to. And this also went to a stronger and sophisticated turn, which is mainly about the purpose of every emotion and the benefit of expressing them, whether it seems good or bad. The movie smartly puts these ideas together as a whimsical journey of learning to understand whatever circumstance you are facing, but also examines the shortcomings of being dishonest to your own feelings.<br/><br/>And again, these ideas are represented as an adventure with a lot of laughs and creativity to follow through. Aside of its thematic core, it also explores how dreams are made, how fears become exaggerated form of nightmares, how prominent memories also hook stuff that you don't necessarily need like commercial songs, and how imaginary places and friends come to life and interact with the emotions. It's a fun atmosphere to look around. The characters are delightful. Even if they're supposed to represent a single emotion, they brought more personalities than they should. The voice acting is wondrous: Amy Poehler brings a sense of lovable optimism in Joy and Phyllis Smith gives earnestness to Sadness. While Bill Hader adds low-key charm as Fear, Mindy Kaling gives the attitude as Disgust, and Lewis Black mostly stealing every scene as Anger.<br/><br/>Inside Out is great, firstly because it's Pixar returning to their creativity and profoundness towards their stories, secondly is it's just really smart. It takes a simple idea and sprinkle it with colorful imagination, clever details of its world, totally likable characters, and a really beautiful portrayal of valuing what you honestly feel in life and learning the importance of it. It's a warmer message than it may sound, because that is the true essence of growing up. Everything else is just an engaging candy that would make you laugh, cry and hope. Welcome back, Pixar! The real spirit of Pixar, to be more specific!"

","Wow. This movie is entertaining and educational. A friend of mine is a psychiatrist, he found it relevant to his 10 year old son and young people in general. He picked up a psychiatric journal that 'does not review movies' but there it was... Inside Out. If there was an 11 this would be a 12. How great was Bing Bong, part cat, cotton candy and dolphin. Lol. This movie brought to life a child's brain - something wonderful and complex. The animation was great, the voices were great but the script was out of this world. Who knew how much fun the visualization of the angst of an 11 year old could be?!? (I mean that in the nicest way.) If you ever tried to picture what goes on in young heads, well, try no more. Inside Out is not for little children, I would say 11/12 and up. I hope to see some Oscar action for Inside Out but hope most of all for as many as possible to see it, learn from it and enjoy it."

"sandnair87","10","19","57","25 August 2015"," Inside Out, Upside Down or Sideways, Pixar's Latest is An 'Emotional' Thrill Ride!
","It's old hat to call a movie an ""emotional thrill ride,"" but in Inside Out, it's literally true, as the abstract concepts of our minds prove to be the perfect playground for the Pixar pixelators.<br/><br/>The opening scenes of Inside Out skillfully introduce the characters while generating a sense of joy at the wonders of the world, as a little girl named Riley is born in Minnesota and starts to grow. But unlike other animated movies, Riley is not the hero of the film. The principal characters are the primary emotions in her head: permanently buoyant, yellow-hued emoticon-Tinkerbell hybrid – Joy; fiery red, pugnacious, his fuse as short as his sleeves – Anger; bespectacled blue blob beneath owlish spectacles – Sadness; chic, fastidious and disdainful green - Disgust and a bow-tie wearing purplish bag-of-nerves with startled eyebrows that levitate above his head - Fear. Together they guide Riley's feelings from a knob-laden control desk, processing her new memories as they arrive at the Head-quarters, each memory looking like a glowing bowling ball and colored according to mood. Some of her experiences become important, influential long-term memories and are stored as color-coded orbs; others are dumped into the vast wasteland of forgotten experiences.<br/><br/>In the idyll of childhood, it's the ever ebullient Joy, naturally, who takes the lead at the console. But childhood bliss cannot last forever. Riley is uprooted from Minnesota to San Francisco when her father takes another job and the turmoil of the move to a new home leaves Riley coping with everything from living in a less-than-desirable neighborhood to missing her friends to feeling like an outcast at her new school. Things are getting complicated inside Riley Central! This soon triggers a crisis as a control-room malfunction leaves Joy and Sadness stranded in a vast allegorical geography of Riley's mind-scape. And so begins an odyssey through her psyche, as they traverse such wonderfully rendered obstacles as a library of memory banks and an imaginary friend - unbearably tragi-cute Bing Bong. Can Joy and Sadness make it back to headquarters in time, before a dejected Riley runs away from home?<br/><br/>Emotions run wildly funny in this exceedingly original story. But what's most brilliant about the Inside Out is how director Pete Docter not only connects beautifully to those emotions but turns them into his characters. The story takes us outside Riley's mind and into the real world just often enough for us to appreciate what she's going through. It's all done with a deft touch. Working with a multi-layered story and a sparkling voice-cast, Inside Out comes with a surprising amount of depth, resulting in a film that is not only delightfully entertaining, but also thought-provoking and very much emotionally-complex.<br/><br/>Pixar has always been great at coaxing our eyeballs out of our fat heads with awe-inspiring visuals and vibrant colors, but Inside Out is undoubtedly the studio's most impressive piece of eye-candy yet. They outdo themselves with vast, intricate, amazingly detailed landscapes ranging from the ""movie studio"" where Riley's dreams are produced every night to the places where Riley's subconscious and abstract thinking reside, all brimming with sparkling visuals. The running gags are all delicious (don't miss the end credits) and keep flying in thick and fast.<br/><br/>Fittingly for a movie set inside someone's head, Pixar's latest is a fireworks display of fizzing ideas and bursts of imagination. Poignant, heartfelt, and endearing, Pixar's latest outing challenges us all to dream, to feel, to be!"
"UsernameHype","5","17","50","28 November 2015"," Pixar has failed again to capture what made them great
","The characters were bland, you could tell how they were going to act in every situation. You couldn't connect with the main girl because she didn't even feel like a character in the movie. The emotions acted the same every time and never changed.<br/><br/>The story was the most predictable thing I have ever watched. In the first 30 minutes you know exactly what is going to happen throughout. The story dragged near the end and left me just wanting the movie to end already. Not to mention this movie rehashes every theme and story element done in other the other Pixar movies, but not as well.<br/><br/>This movie is made for kids, yes. That does not make it good. It was borderline okay and suffered from many problems, better luck to Pixar next time, please make a good movie again."
"HaidarDagham","Null","17","50","1 November 2015"," Very nice movie
","Before I start, I will say this; I'm writing this after coming back from a second viewing of Inside Out. Both viewings were out of choice. That's not a unique thing, but I very rarely watch films more than once at the cinema, mainly because life is short, or rather, life is too quick for me. But there's two main reasons why people watch some films more than once at the cinema, especially where I come from; either the film was interesting, detailed, or multi-layered and needs to be seen again to sink in properly, or, it was really, really good.<br/><br/>In this case, for me, it's the latter. That's not to say that the film isn't interesting, detailed or multi-layered, but the reason that was repeating in my head to see it again was 'it's really, really good.' But is it? Yes, yes of course it is... Speaking with a bunch of friends with whom I saw it the first time, a risky phrase was unanimously agreed upon, which was that we 'trust the Pixar team to do the right thing.' Needless (totally needless) to say that expectations were high, and frankly, they were surpassed.<br/><br/>Even though the film is what we come to expect from Pixar (the universal moral themes, the perfect balance between comedy and sadness, and visually stunning animation and action sequences), I didn't feel that I had seen it all before, and neither was it repetitive nor 'ordinary'. The film hits all the high notes, with perfect intonation, and with discipline and passion. As touched on before, the balance between humour and sadness is strong and impressive; the amount of emotions that the film displays and takes us through is varied and immersive, yet not overwhelming. The film executes such clever ideas with simplicity and ease, leaving us to feel for the characters rather than worry about the 'science' of it all, or even being worried about 'not getting it'.<br/><br/>The animation is constantly eye-drawing and detailed; the characters' glistening skin is particularly wondrous. And what great characters they are. Riley is brilliantly sympathetic throughout, even with her difficult mood swings, and the supporting characters are perfectly entertaining. One might think that the superficial nature of the characters (Anger is angry, Fear is always scared etc.) would become old quickly, however the fun never diminishes, thanks to a witty script, expressive animation, and very strong voice performances from the entire cast.<br/><br/>However, to top all this off, the real gem comes from the character of Joy, surely a strong contender in the list of Pixar's greatest characters. Even though we are inside the head of Riley for the majority of the film, and the events that drive the movie are essentially her reactions to her new world (moving from Minnesota to San Francisco), the story is Joy's. Being probably the most flawed character in the film (paradoxically, maybe), it's her journey we care about the most, and she ends up being the most in-depth character in the film, occasionally questioning her actions in the first half (well, the cynics will be), and becoming the most sympathetic by the end. Amy Poehler's outstanding performance makes Joy simultaneously the strongest and weakest character in the film (emotionally, that is).<br/><br/>After all of this, the freshness of the ideas, the simplified neuroscience, the technical brilliance (saying that, Giacchino's score is probably the most subtle thing in the film, exquisitely putting the finishing touches on the most emotional scenes), fleshed out characters and universal themes, all of this comes together simply to entertain us, to let us escape, and to release us emotionally, which it does by making us laugh and cry in an even and fair manner.<br/><br/>And you will laugh. And you will cry. And it is fun to do so. Thank god we're living in a time when Pixar is making these films."
"sjspears-17141","8","17","50","27 October 2015"," One of the Greatest Movies of our Time
","Contrary to those who believe that Inside Out was a movie for ""12 year old girls"" or a complete disappointment or even Disney's worst production, I believe that Inside Out was an excellent movie in that its mastery of presenting real life topics (the role emotions play in our perception of memories throughout our lives) in such a way that children are able to grasp the ideas. Now before I continue I want to make it clear that while I am writing a positive review, I am NOT a mom or dad. There are many reasons as to why I believe that Inside Out was a success and not, as some would say, a failure. 1. While there are many other emotions besides anger, fear, disgust, joy, or sadness, the latter are the most common emotions present when we reflect upon memories. You wouldn't say ""Oh, that was a desirous memory or exciting memory"" you would be more likely to describe it as a happy or joyous memory. Also, if any one of the haters bothered to read the Trivia section about the movie, they would know that 27 other emotions were considered (surprise, trust, and pride were among those that were cut) but settled with joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger to make it less complicated for CHILDREN 2. This movie was made for kids. Thus, that is why there are no ""adult"" themes. However, to say there were no adult themes present would be saying that the idea of emotions, the occasional struggle to sort your emotions or memories, does not apply to adults which is simply not true because this notion applies to the young and old. 3. Inside Out presents the idea to young children that it is okay to express your emotions, that our memories will not always be joyous, but that they will not always be sad. Yes, there were some minor flaws within the movie, but to say that the writers and directors should be fired and never again be allowed to set foot on a PIXAR (this movie was a Disney PIXAR movie, not a Disney movie--they are two different things) set is ridiculous. Not every movie that Pixar has made has been a success. Every production company is bound to experience failures, that's how we learn what does and doesn't work, but in order to succeed one needs to take risks. And those who believe Inside Out to have been a complete failure need a wake up call because that's what this movie was..a risk. It was a movie that explored themes, topics, and issues that no other Disney or Disney Pixar movie had dared to do. And to compare it to Pixar's many other movies would be unjust and unfair not only to Inside Out, but to those other movies because each movie is its own, with different themes, and different topics."
"moeez-subhani","5","17","50","5 July 2015"," could have been much better!
","I was super excited after I saw the first trailer, very new and fresh idea.. I must say intelligent thought! I eagerly waited for this movie because I love animated movies.<br/><br/>However I feel not the same after watching the movie. The idea was brilliant of course, but the plot could have been much more interesting if they would have shown the emotions interacting with the external world rather stuck with their own problems! I thoroughly enjoyed the parts where the emotions interacted with the outside world, other part was quite boring :/<br/><br/>Please make a sequel, with a better plot of course!"
"natashabowiepinky","6","17","50","23 June 2015"," NOT a return to 'form'
","Maybe I just don't get it. Perhaps there's something intrinsic to the the whole experience I require clarifying on. Somewhere, there might be an obscure reason I don't feel as passionately about this film as others have.<br/><br/>Or maybe, JUST maybe...<br/><br/>Inside Out is overrated.<br/><br/>I mean, yea... The animation is excellent. But this is PIXAR we're talking about here... Not Hanna Barbera, circa 1970's. It kinda comes with the territory. And yes, the concept is very clever... But then again, it reminds me of an old comic strip I used to read called 'The Numbskulls' about small men controlling an average human's body. Then of course, there was the film Osmosis Jones, which regarded the adventures of the tiny people who were involved in the day-to-day running of Bill Murray. Not one of his funniest roles, BTW.<br/><br/>But something is definitely missing here. I found sections of the film a bit dull, none of the attempts at humour really made me laugh, and that pink elephant 'imaginary friend' was almost as obnoxious as Olaf the snowman. The part where I suppose we were meant to feel sad, as he was abandoned to fade away with the rest of the Riley's memories, just made me think 'about ruddy time'. What else was he supposed to do... Live, and cause a pre-teen to go through years of enforced therapy?<br/><br/>There wasn't enough going on in the human world, either...There was no real bond, with Riley, our lead character and the viewer... She felt more like a robot programmed by her five emotions than a living, breathing person. Her parents were as stereotypical and plastic as they come, and no other person has enough interaction with Riley for us to empathise with them... Or her, for that matter.<br/><br/>So, what it all boils down to is the quintet of emotions who live in her head and apparently call the shots there. Of them, Anger, Disgust and Fear and the most interesting, but guess what? They're the ones who get the shortest thrift in the script, and end up (for the most part) stuck in the 'control room' while Joy and Sadness go on the main quest. Joy's eternal perkiness is irritating, and Sadness is just a walking doormat. Not the pair I would have chosen for the lion's share of the movie to follow... And the film suffers because of this.<br/><br/>A lot of critics praise the authenticity of the memories Riley has and how it reminds them of their own children and lost youth... REALLY?! In that case, there must be a lot of reviewers out there who live in unbearably corny Life Insurance commercials, full of stock images and manufactured familiar situations. Watching the sun go down? First day at school? Eating broccoli?! Do me a favour.<br/><br/>Plus, some of them seem a bit unlikely... In one flashback, Riley misses the big shot in a hockey game, and hands the championship to the rival side. What do the rest of her team do? Why, put her on their shoulders and throw her up in the air repeatedly!! In the cutthroat world of American competitive sport, I HIGHLY doubt it. Or perhaps they just like being Losers. Hmm...<br/><br/>I did actually enjoy the film, so you might think I'm being a tad harsh. But bear in mind this is PIXAR we're talking about here... Who's every feature was virtually a masterpiece. After a string of underwhelming flicks, though (Brave, Cars 2, Monsters University, and now this) perhaps it's about time I stopped treating them as the purveyors of miracles, and think of the company as a normal studio who pumps out spectacularly animated but somewhat shallow productions. Just like Dreamworks.<br/><br/>What a shame. 6/10"
"k-b-ego","9","15","43","23 June 2015"," Inside out, a perfect example of imagination
","Disney and Pixar have teamed up once again and brought us inside out, a film that explores the emotions inside an 11 year Old's head and the personified emotions that control it, I won't go in depth because you should definitely experience this movie yourself without knowing too much about the plot beforehand.<br/><br/>I'll start with the flaws or more accurately flaw because I only had one with this movie and it was rather minuscule. My single problem with this movie is that I didn't find there to be much of a score, when the score was prevalent it was great, terrific ambiance that set the mood beautifully but I felt there were some scenes that definitely could have used some more music backing them up.<br/><br/>Looking at the casting for this movie I thought it would be perfect, and I was right. Amy Poehler was absolutely perfect as joy and Lewis Black as Anger? completely ingenious casting decision. I'd put the animation in this film up against any other animated film, it was lush, bright, defined, simply beautiful. The subject matter in this movie will touch teens, young and older adults more so than children, not that children won't enjoy this movie but I can't help but feel that they just don't have enough life experience to fully understand it which I think is a good thing. it's a film they can grow old with and see it differently as time passes.<br/><br/>This is a movie about emotions which is sort of ironic because it's an incredible emotional experience. It was very interesting to see how much differently this was affecting people in the theater, some were crying, some were laughing and I can almost guarantee ALL were enjoying. The whole duration of this movie I found myself thinking ""Pete Docter and his team may have what could be the greatest imagination in the business"" this movie is simple but makes you think at the same time which seem like opposing ideas but just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Inside out is a terrific film animated or otherwise. It'll make you laugh, cry, think, and most importantly, have fun. Go see this film, take your kids, parents, grandparents, friends and anyone else you enjoy watching movies with, they'll all take away something different from it but I bet they will all love it."
"mgha-37042","1","26","83","12 July 2015"," Could've been a lot better!
","Wow, I'd waited long to see this movie after so much hoopla been created over it since months. But BAM, it turned out to be a big let down! It just doesn't live up to the hype. It's an 'okay' type movie. And, how'd it get 8+ on IMDb, I'll never know. I guess there's a bias towards Disney movies. It stands somewhere near '6' or something. Little kids may enjoy it but only if they get the concept. Those who'll get the concept, won't enjoy it. So, overall, you can skip this one. Or, watch it at home at the most. I'd rather watch an old Japanese animation than this one. There are so many good movies by studio ghibli that never get old and boring even if you watch them again and again. And, I heard they have recently put out what is possibly their last movie ""When Marnie Was There"". I haven't watched that yet. So, now is probably the time!"
"flagmichael","9","14","40","3 July 2015"," Better than I expected
","We each carry our own stories into movies about childhood. Somehow I expected Riley's emotions to be in conflict rather than genuinely trying to keep her on track as she grows. I also somehow expected her parents to be less caring than they actually were. This story is, instead, a profile of an emotionally healthy couple and their only child living through a bit of a rough patch.<br/><br/>Our adult daughter and her 4, 6, and 8 year old children saw the movie with us and all of them liked it a lot. Not all the action was wrapped in deep thought - there were several laugh-out-loud moments that worked even for the 4 year old. None of the kids got restless or talkative, a good measure of their absorption. However, I would be concerned about sensitive teens seeing the series of setbacks in the movie. They went over the heads of our young ones but a 15 year old girl may not be so sanguine.<br/><br/>I liked that the last five minutes or so of the movie came after the resolution but were not an anticlimax at all... they were many of the funniest scenes in the movie. That gave me time to dry my eyes inconspicuously."
"algrigg","9","14","40","1 July 2015"," Easily one of the best and most complex animated movies in a long time
","First off, the detractors of this film cannot seem to agree on their argument about why it is bad. ""It's too realistic, and therefore depressing..."" ""It's too UNrealistic, because it doesn't show a girl from a broken home or abusive parents..."" ""It's too heavy for kids and they won't get it..."" For what it is worth, this film is both entertaining AND fascinating. The depiction of Riley's brain is actually very well thought-out and digestible for young kids, and its complexities can be appreciated further by adults and older kids. It's very true that there are many jokes and plot points that will go well over the heads of young children, but the underlying message is wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. Making a movie that is kid-centered and kid-targeted is very different than making a movie that is kid-friendly. Some of the most effective family movies of all time have significantly adult themes and plot points. Think about how ET, the first time you saw it, was likely a sob-fest (at least for a while), but ended up being a classic. Toy Story, while a bit more understandable for kids, deals with the crisis of not having an identity and finding a place for yourself. This movie is much the same, as it deals with the sad reality that childhood memories DO eventually go away, and growing up is a tough thing to do. But, on the other side, it leads to a more complex, more whole person.

","The movie follows Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), a happy 11 year-old girl with loving parents, great friends, and a passion for hockey – thanks to subtle monitoring from her personified emotions. For over a decade, Riley's emotions – led by the exuberant Joy (Amy Poehler) – have helped their girl navigate the ups and downs of life, ensuring that even the most challenging days result in happy memories. When Riley's father takes on a stressful new job in San Francisco, the Minnesotan pre-teen tries to be positive about the family move, buoyed by the Joy's can-do attitude.<br/><br/>As Joy attempts to keep Riley focused on the bright side of life, the young girl faces disappointments that throw her emotions into chaos. In a desperate attempt to regain control, Joy tampers with Riley's memory logging system, which inadvertently leaves Joy and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) stranded in the maze of Long Term Memory. As Riley faces one frustrating situation after another in the world, Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Fear (Bill Hader), and Anger (Lewis Black) attempt to keep their girl from mental collapse, while Joy and Sadness embark on a dangerous trek back to ""Headquarters.""<br/><br/>After the release of Toy Story 3, Pixar hit a slump in their movies being lackluster. Moreover, fans were starting to question whether Pixar was collapsing, and whether they would be making any original films instead of sequels/prequels. It's clear, given the announcement of Toy Story 4, Cars 3, Finding Dory, and The Incredibles 2, that sequels are now a key piece of Pixar's production slate; yet, there's nothing quite like a fresh Pixar tale. Inside Out is the best Pixar film in years, blending thought-provoking human drama (for kids and adults) with an imaginative premise and whimsical adventure – a must-see for children, parents, and cinephiles alike.<br/><br/>Director Pete Docter, who had directed Up and Monsters Inc, has created a beautiful and dynamic film. The story setup and balance between Riley's real life conflicts and the fantastical internal drama of her emotions, is fertile ground in both visual sophistication and narrative punch. Riley's emotions color her view of the world – literally (through shifts in visual tone) and figuratively (as she reacts to events in the story). This combination of vibrant fantasy and real-world challenges is the hallmark of Pixar's most iconic and groundbreaking films, which depicts a deeply emotional story through unique perspectives.<br/><br/>For Inside Out, Pixar anthropomorphizes emotion – with a new set of colorful characters for young viewers to enjoy, while also exploring one of mankind's greatest mysteries: the mind. Delving into psychology theory, Docter injects entertaining but equally sophisticated insight into how emotions influence behavior – insight that affords Inside Out's audience a chance for self-discovery and reflection, regardless of age.<br/><br/>Amy Poehler leads the voice cast as Joy – a familiar fit (in all the right ways) for the comedy actress. Docter imbues Joy, along with the rest of Riley's emotions, with layered personalities – even though they're each representative of a single ""feeling."" The characters are ripe for gags that play off their emotional namesakes (ex., Anger is a hothead) but Inside Out manages to find a deeper level for the protagonists on the inside – the same nuance that differentiated past Pixar animation films from their contemporaries. As a result, Joy struggles with her own fear, disgust, sadness, and anger – breathing life into what could have been a gimmicky outline (while also contributing to the movie's larger message of emotional maturation).<br/><br/>Smith leads the supporting cast, providing the same depth to Sadness that is given to Joy – and, in spite of Poehler's energetic leading role, Sadness is instrumental in many of Inside Out's funniest and most impactful scenes. Kaling, Hader, and Black are given less to do, but their characters are not afterthoughts. Docter ensures each has a spotlight to shine in the movie, and makes it apparent that each emotion is essential in maintaining Riley's safety and happiness.<br/><br/>As indicated, Inside Out also makes a genuine effort to juxtapose the zany cartoon hijinks of Riley's mind with relatable and heartwarming real-world drama. Docter dedicates a significant amount of his runtime to life in San Francisco, as Riley and her parents endeavor to carve out a new home there. Thanks to Pixar's evolving depiction of CG people, Inside Out accurately animates micro-expressions and body language that are crucial in non- verbal comprehension of emotion. Riley isn't necessarily the most realistic person that Pixar has ever animated, but instead of striving for photorealism, the studio takes advantage of Inside Out's cartoonish style to accentuate human emotion – delivering some of the most expressive CG characters in animation history.<br/><br/>After years of cashing-in on established film franchises, Inside Out is a much-appreciated return to form for Pixar Animation. In an industry that is packed with CG animation studios, many of which have made significant strides in quality over the years, Docter's latest film offers a sobering reminder of the invention and heart that turned Pixar into one of Hollywood's most beloved (and bankable) brands. More than an entertaining film, Inside Out is an important reflection on the power of emotion – and proof that Pixar is still king of imaginative CG animated storytelling."

","This film focuses mainly on Joy and Sadness. They obviously have opposite personalities and it is quite interesting to see how they react to each others decisions. On the other hand, Fear, Anger, and Disgust are together dealing with other things that I will not specify due to spoilers.<br/><br/>I have always loved Pixar movies since I was a little kid. I had really lost hope in them after watching Cars 2 and Brave. I went into this movie expecting it to be about as good as Brave, but was shocked to see a Pixar film that was actually very entertaining. I now have hope in Pixar again and am anticipating 'the Good Dinasaur' next year.<br/><br/>The short that played before the film (Lava). Was actually quite interesting. I do not want to spoil anything so lets just say its an adorable little story about a volcano that includes a song. It featured some sea turtles that have the same design as the sea turtles from Finding Nemo but these turtles looked even better. I give this 'Pixar Short' a nine out of ten because of the fascinating original story, the great song, and the amazing animation that Pixar always delivers.<br/><br/>This movie really makes you think. It's about time we get an original idea from Pixar. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I think that kids will love it. It is by no means the best Pixar film because lets face it, the Pixar classics are amazing. I still give this movie a nine out of ten because we finally got an original idea from pixar, we got the great animation, and most of all, it made me enjoy Pixar again.<br/><br/>If you have any questions or comments or would just like to talk to me, email nickmoviereviews@gmail.com.

"goldberry-90-44341","Null","15","44","7 July 2015"," Pixar's Most Emotional Movie Yet
","If there's anything that can be said about this film, it's that it's by far Pixar's most emotional movie to date. Hehehehe...sorry, couldn't resist. But really, I spent an alarming amount of time with a lump in my throat. However, while Pixar's latest film is a fascinating thought experiment, it definitely has its flaws.<br/><br/>It's a little bit difficult to decide whether the emotion lies in the movie or in the memories it evokes. I'd imagine it's a completely different experience for a child viewer, a teenager, or a parent, but I suspect the last two appreciate its full weight far more than young children would. It's not that kids won't like the film: to the contrary, it feels like it's designed for younger viewers, unlike Ratatouille or The Incredibles (my two favorite Pixar films.) It's merely that this story is more about the loss of childhood than the celebration of it. This bittersweet feel is similar to that in Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>The story is about Riley, an eleven-year-old whose young life has been blissfully happy up until the day her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. She had tons of friends, doting parents, a successful hockey career, a never-ending chain of happy memories, symbolized by glowing marbles.<br/><br/>These memories are fashioned by her five emotions: Joy (an enthusiastic Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Fear (Bill Hader), and Anger (Lewis Black.) Up until this point, Joy has had complete control, but glimpses into the minds of Riley's parents - where Sadness and Anger are the primary fueling emotions - foreshadow that things may be about to change. Joy recognizes the place of Fear, Disgust, and Anger - they keep Riley safe. But Sadness, that most adult of emotions, seems to have no function whatsoever. In a more typical movie, Sadness would have been cast as the villain. But this isn't a typical movie.<br/><br/>Once Riley arrives in San Francisco, all of her happiness comes into question. We follow her through the events of the move, her first day at school and trying out for the hockey team. Inside of her head, something has gone terribly wrong, and the emotions have to work double time to get things right. It's clever how the movie uses the emotions - you can almost fool yourself into thinking that what happens to Riley is a consequence of what they do, but in the end, you know that they are an allegory for her mind, not the other way around. But the emotions don't know what the viewer knows must happen: they expect childhood to continue forever, and memories to remain simply happy or sad or angry or fearful or disgusting.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie takes place over the space of a few days, as Riley's emotional life crumbles and she has to redefine herself. Looking back, the whole thing is not all that huge a crisis, but it's magnified by the drama of her emotions. It reminds me of Lord of the Flies (bear with me) in that the film does a great job of getting us into a child's head. It's surprising to look back and, like returning to a childhood home as an adult, realize how small everything was, after all.<br/><br/>Childhood is a complicated thing. We see Riley's happiness, but also her immaturity. In the end - and here's kind of a spoiler - the resolution comes through growing up, not embracing childhood. Sadness can lead us just as sensibly as Joy, and perhaps even the other emotions - in their proper place - have a role in engaging the world wisely. Being happy isn't the most important thing.<br/><br/>I'm not as impressed with the film as some. It's good, but not amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the over-colorful milieu it embraces in its Inside sequences - it felt too much like other bright children's films I've seen, and lessened the impact of the dark Outside. I didn't find the idea as original as other did, either (I'll admit, I was thinking of Osmosis Jones, a film which is probably really terrible, but the last time I saw it I was six.)<br/><br/>There was too much of a focus on preschool imagery for an eleven-year- old - by that age I was obsessed with dragons and pirates, rather than clowns and pink elephants. Because one could see the direction of the allegory, the story could be predictable, and I could foretell events some time before they actually happened.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Inside Out has tons of strengths. It's the most original Pixar film since Up, and Riley's family is the best Pixar family since The Incredibles. The emotions are terrifically voiced and animated - my personal favorite is Phyllis Smith's sullen, melodramatic Sadness, but Poehler is wonderful as ebullient Joy. They're Pixar's first female duo - follow-ups to Mike and Sully and Buzz and Woody.<br/><br/>The filmmakers have a ton of fun with Riley's mind - I especially loved the dream sets, sub-conscious, and Imaginary Boyfriend. It's really very funny - at moments, I defied the silent theater to guffaw uproariously at subtle jokes. (Or the not-subtle ones: ""GIRL - GIRL - GIRL."")<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think the biggest compliment I can give to the movie is that (no pun intended) it got inside my head. I'm still young enough to vividly remember the confused emotions and insecurity of adolescence. These days, I often have opportunities to reflect on what my sixteen-year-old self would make of the things I'm doing now. Watching old family videos with horror just last week, I realized I have almost nothing in common with eleven-year-old Hannah. And what a complete idiot she was. And how happy she was in her idiocy! Dangit, Pixar. Inside Out is going to keep me thinking about those things for some time to come.<br/><br/>Originally posted here: http://goo.gl/0URBvh"
"ElMaruecan82","10","11","30","14 September 2016"," An Allegorical Masterpiece...
","I often dreamed about movies, but never BEFORE watching them. It happened with ""Inside Out"", I had heard so many great things about it and the ubiquitous multi-colored posters were so eye-catchy, that the film was ""inside"" my mind already, fittingly so, and now that I saw it, I can say that it will stay there... for a while.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" is indeed the kind of movie that makes you want to emulate Amélie by turning around in the theater and see the smiling faces of the people around. I don't know for you, but after a few minutes, my eyes were literally glued to the screen, and from the expression on my face, you could tell that Joy's smile and optimism were irresistibly contagious.<br/><br/>The entrance of Joy (Amy Poehler) and the genesis of the other emotion-related creatures in the mind of little Riley, echoed both my memories as a child and my current life as a little girl's daddy. Now, I look at her cries, her tantrums and the way she makes funny faces when told to behave herself in a whole different light. In less than five minutes, the film had already hit a sensitive chord, not that I doubt an animated film could achieve such a sentimental 'stunt', ""Mary and Max."" and ""Up"" had also done a terrific job on that level.<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning ""Up"" because the two films hold a few similarities, beside being from the same director Pete Docter. Indeed, after tackling the loneliness of old age and the mourning of lost dreams, it's time for a brighter mindset, no pun intended. Riley is a preteen girl, still young enough to make monkey faces with Daddy, think of boys as playmates and sleep with soft toys, but she's old enough to react with maturity and empathy as her parents expect from their happy girl (in parent's language ""understanding"") and all the emotions help Riley to face this critical time of her life, by pushing the right button (inside) at the right moment (out), literally.<br/><br/>So, as the title suggests, the film is set in two worlds, the real world with Riley moving with her parents from Minnesota to San Francisco and the inside of her head, the ""headquarters"" where emotions lead the show. The Chief Emotion is Joy, a blue-haired Tinkerbell-like creature with hair shaped like a star and radiating such an illuminated yellow she doesn't have a shadow. Joy looks at the bright side of life, and makes it a point of honor not to let Riley surrender to sadness the poor, short, rotund, bespectacled Sadness (Phyllis Smith) who can't push any button, and that doesn't do any good to her already low self-esteem.<br/><br/>With a bossy emotion like Joy, Riley is a naturally happy girl, but as you would read in every 'Stay Positive' or 'Emotional Intelligence' book, each feeling has a reason to exist. Anger allows us to defend our integrity and fear is about self-preservation, sadness is a reaction to things we can't control and disgust, well disgust actually feels like a 'filler' because it doesn't have more reason to be there than, say, surprise or distrust. Never mind, the real outsider is Sadness. In other headquarters, thing go differently: the mother's chief emotion is Sadness and a mustached 'Anger' controls the father (by the way, I enjoyed these little glimpses on other headquarters, a nice touch for a film full of them).<br/><br/>Now to the emotions, voiced by Lewis Black and based on his stand-up routines, Anger is a red fire brick dressed like a tired businessman, Fear is a purple raw nerve voiced by Bill Hader and Disgust is a broccoli-shaped fashion victim voiced by Mindy Kaling. Cinema is an Art of imagery and I don't think there's been a film as visually stunning without going for complex forms and settings; it's all in the colors, shapes and personalities. Emotions are people, memories are balls with the same color than their emotional value and Riley's mind is an enchanting Oz-like place, surrounded by Goofball, Family or Friendship Islands, where the core memories are 'stocked'.<br/><br/>I was critical toward ""Inception"" because the film had a similar concept but didn't have much to offer except for predictable CGI special effects. In ""Inside Out"", emotions, dreams, imaginary friends, little things that define us, everything is materialized in a creatively allegorical way. This is escapism at its best and it didn't have to go as far as the Lost Falls. Recreating an entire world is the biggest challenge of animated cartoons, but ""Inside Out"" created an entire new world and made its functioning coherent, easy to follow and scientifically viable in a weird way.<br/><br/>But I make it sound like a technical achievement, the film also fulfills its premise in the storytelling department. By accidentally preventing Sadness from saddening a happy memory during the first day of school, both Joy and Sadness are expelled from the headquarters and get lost somewhere in the brain. They must get back, otherwise, Riley will only be controlled by anger, disgust and fear. And the oddest thing is that Riley's behavior still looks familiar from an outsider's perspective. Seriously, how many times we've met young kids behaving exactly like Riley?<br/><br/>The film unexpectedly provides some interesting insights about kids' behavior and the way they repress positive emotions, to the point that even the 'negative' ones can't control them and make them capable of anything. Some parts are so intense they catch you off-guard, but they help to show the importance of emotions depending on the context. And during this unforgettable journey, Joy will also understand the power of sadness as a vehicle for happier emotions... no high spots without low ones.<br/><br/>I start with smiles and I conclude with tears, because after all, this is still a Disney film, and paraphrasing the Master: for every laugh, there should be a tear. Hear, hear, Joy!"

","Pixar has done it again with this great animated film ""Inside Out"", this is a beautiful concept explaining emotions within humans and the story is just great. Inside Out is a great family friendly movie which I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to watch.<br/><br/>When Inside Out was released in theaters we were on the road a lot and Annika got to check it out on opening night, sadly with her schedule she didn't have the time to put up a review and insisted that I check it out; well I did. After a few times of watching Inside Out to make sure that my opinion didn't change, I've certainly come to the final agreement that this movie is perfect. Being that Pixar along with Disney put this movie out, that alone tells you the graphics were off the charts but the story, wow beautifully put together. The voice overs fit the character better than most films in the animation genre; great stuff! This is one of my favor Pixar related films."
"ingridg-78226","10","18","55","31 October 2015"," I loved it.
","This was a very touching movie. The movie portrays a young girl named Riley who moves to a whole new city. The characters in the movie are Riley's individual emotions who decide when and what she feels at a certain moment. Always being seen as a 'happy girl' by her parents because her joyous emotion is always in control. The joyful emotion doesn't like to see her sad so she doesn't let it happen often. Because of this her sadness emotion is lacking a lot and becomes out of control. A conflict happens cause both joy and sadness to loose control and become lost in her mind. The other 3 emotions are lost on what to do to take care of Riley in a city that's new to all of them. The frustration and confusing lead them to loose complete control of Riley's emotions until she finally lets out the sadness that has been held back. This touches me because I have been in situations where I'm expected to be happy and jolly but inside i just want to cry and take some time to just let those emotions out. I talk to someone i trust about how I'm feeling and let out a good cry to make myself feel better inside."

","This is easily one of the most complex children's films I have ever seen, and I simply do not understand the hatred for it. It is in no way inappropriate for children, and presents it's complexity in a way children can completely understand, and people accuse it of teaching bad morals, when they completely do not understand. The animation is beautiful, and stunning to look at. I consider it on par with something like spirited away, and it milks all the emotion from every scene. The only emotions themselves are very entertaining. People are accusing Joy of being a bully to sadness, not understanding that it's a metaphor for the tone trying to keep the way it is. The film is very emotional and always milks all the drama possible from each scene, but still keeps it reasonable. I loved it and everyone I know love it and nobody can take that away."
"kunalkhandwala","9","14","41","19 July 2015"," Refreshing view of the mind that's delightfully entertaining
","As a studio whose films established benchmarks in animation technology, Pixar has also set a precedent in refreshed storytelling with some deeply emotional and philosophical undertones. In its most audacious attempt at that and in the extraordinary league of 'Up' and 'Wall-E', Pixar now gets behind the scenes of adolescence in the most imaginative way possible with Inside Out. Directors Peter Docter ('Up', 'Monsters, Inc') and Ronnie Del Carmen create a wonderfully animated world of the complex human mind with stunning details of notions such as islands of personality, dream studios, imagination land and the headquarters. Riley is 11 years old and so far, Joy has successfully managed to be her dominant emotion. Until she moves to San Francisco with her parents.<br/><br/>Born in Minnesota, Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) excels at ice hockey, has a close friend and is loved by her equally goofy parents. These aspects of her life form her personality and special memories leave a lasting impression in her mind. Her father's business prospects move them to San Francisco and that's when their dreams of being in the beautiful city by the bay slowly start to crumble with a typical house that is on the verge of ruin. Riley must also struggle at school as a newbie without friends while coping with anxious parents who are already troubled with financial woes. While all of this happens on the Outside, the emotions in her head are actually animated characters who have the job of maintaining sanctity in Riley's personality. Joy (Amy Poehler) is vibrant, positive and just... happy. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) has her depressing way of seeing things and is somehow inspired to touch all of Riley's memories. Fear (Bill Hader) is obsessively cautious about Riley's each move, thus keeping her safe while Disgust (Mindy Kaling) brings out the sass and disapproval of things and people for Riley. Then there's the newspaper reading, head scorching, easily agitated emotion of Anger (Lewis Black) that basically entertains the viewers. Through their combined efforts, memory, in the form of orbs roll into the headquarters with most of them being the color of Joy. The special memories outside, become core memories inside that are safeguarded meticulously. Her personality traits outside form islands of personality inside which look more like intricate theme parks that connect to headquarters via a narrow bridge. Dreams are created in the dream studios whereas the imagination land houses the odd and mysterious fantasies that are temporarily created by Riley. Then there's the literal train of thought that chugs all around and the pit where discarded memories lay.<br/><br/>What makes Inside Out so enjoyable is its depiction of such complex mechanisms of the human mind, simplified in the most artistic manner that can relate to some kids but all adults. So much so that the manifestations that are created by Riley, such as the adorable Bing Bong are merely a part of her growing up. Adults will relate to such themes and the emotions felt by them will perhaps be the opposite of what their kids would feel. An impulsive mistake by sadness sucks Joy, herself and Riley's core memories through the duct that throws them around the islands. In their absence, the headquarters falls in disarray, thus reflecting upon Riley's behavior. She turns cold, aloof and decides upon things she might regret later on. Joy and Sadness have to take whatever help they can get in order to get back to headquarters before it is too late. But the mind is a complex arena of cryptic lanes, creative studios and fantasy characters that won't make the return of such vital emotions easy. <br/><br/>Peter Docter has visualized a very human story that each of us can relate to. If 'Up' was all about not letting go of a life that's dear to you and believing in it if there's nothing to lose, Inside Out shows the lighter side of how the growing up stage works inside a child's head. The emotions aren't battling it out for supremacy in the mind but are actually playing their own little parts to keep their human from struggling in life. Riley couldn't let go of her past self and adaptation was a challenge she simply couldn't overcome but with Joy at the control center of her mind's headquarters, she was in good hands. This is Pixar's return to form and perhaps the most important film to watch this year while superheroes and monsters from the past grab your summer's attention. The animation is ground-breaking once again and not because it is state-of-the-art but because it exploits the potential of such art for a compelling story that couldn't have been depicted in any other way. You will fall in love with all the characters especially Joy, Sadness, Bing Bong, Anger and Riley herself. Brilliantly conceived and adroitly directed, Inside Out is a must watch.<br/><br/>9.001 on a scale of 1-10."
"Al_The_Strange","8","14","41","17 July 2015"," ""Do you ever look at someone and wonder, 'What is going on inside their head?'""
","The human mind is a complex labyrinth of mental processes, conscious and unconscious thoughts, emotions, memories, and more. It's a muscle that's always working in complicated ways to ensure our survival in day-to-day interactions, and for human beings in particular, this extends to emotional well-being, socializing, rationalizing, communicating, and more. Few people, if any, fully understand how the human brain fully works; it's just always there, and the voices in our heads are always there to guide us through life. With Pixar's film Inside Out, filmmakers cleverly interpret neuroscience into a whole new universe where emotions are characters, memories are objects to be stored and used, and their interactions are what cause people to act the way they do.<br/><br/>In spite of the premise, the film definitely employs some imaginative world-building, featuring visually fantastic scenes where a person's mind is a surreal fantasy world akin to Alice in Wonderland (which in itself could be interpreted as a mental thing anyway). Within the mind of one little girl, there are ""personality islands"" that represents Riley's values; there's a literal ""train of thought"" that appears; there's a zone where ""abstract thought"" turns the characters into literally abstract figures; there's a film studio that makes dreams; and so much more. It's a clever way to translate what we know of the brain into literal places that are visually impressive and sometimes funny. What brings the mental landscape to life will be the characters though - the interaction between all the emotions creates plenty of hilarious comedy between themselves, and causes people to react in funny ways too. Altogether, the movie is just as cute, funny, and imaginative as Toy Story and Monsters Inc. were.<br/><br/>The story has two different narratives working for it. On one level, it's the simple story about Riley, the girl who has to move from rural Minnesota to San Francisco, and has to cope with all the stress of leaving behind home and living in a new place. In her head is where the bulk of the film's adventure takes place, in which Riley's Joy and Sadness both go missing and have to find their way back to headquarters before the other emotions mess up Riley's life for good. It's a pretty lightweight story on both accounts, with subtle levels of conflict. What makes the film compelling will be the characters, both external and internal. It is consistently fun to watch the emotions, for even though they are one-dimensional, their personalities clash and react in dynamic ways. Thanks to their relationships, Riley and her family are brought to life in a perfectly lovable way as well. Their struggles are struggles that we can all relate to though; the film underscores the turmoil around life changes and maturity that we all face at some point, and through those fundamental conflicts, the film reaches an emotional resonance as the characters straddle the threshold of maintaining psychological stability.<br/><br/>This film is crafted with top-notch animation quality. It's a bright and colorful film with plenty of imaginative designs. Lighting, textures, and rendering are all great. Movements are very lively and smooth. In some areas, it is genuinely impressive as to how big in scale some of the settings and locales are. Voice-acting is great from the whole cast, the writing is good, and the music score is appropriate.<br/><br/>Inside Out is cute, funny, and pretty clever, much like the other films Pixar is best known for. It deserves a look.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Good | Film: Good)"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","14","41","7 July 2015"," The most creative animated film of the digital era
","When Pixar announced ""Up"" and ""Monsters Inc."" director Pete Docter's ""Untitled Pixar Film that Takes You Inside the Mind,"" there was little doubt that the animation giant and its brilliant minds had yet another work of genius in development. Flash forward and the revolutionary studio has not disappointed with this endlessly creative, whimsical journey now titled ""Inside Out.""<br/><br/>This totally original film couldn't have come too soon for Pixar fans following the commercial cash-grabs that were ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University"" and the beautiful yet very traditional fairy tale ""Brave"" (not to mention no film in 2014). It's a huge bounce back, and it would not be a stretch to call this Pixar's most creative film, or even the most creative animated film of the digital era. <br/><br/>The story depicts 11-year-old Riley's first major life challenge: moving from Minnesota to San Francisco with her mother and father. Yet it imagines her entire personality/brain as its own living world, piloted by her five chief emotions, all personified as characters: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).<br/><br/>Narrated by Joy, we see key moments of Riley's life growing up that have become her ""core memories,"" represented as shiny orbs, with each memory triggering a part of Riley's personality. To this point, Riley's core memories are all tinted yellow because they have been joyful, and Joy plans to keep it that way. The big move, however, makes this challenging, and after a struggle with Sadness, Joy and Sadness find themselves booted out of Riley's command center and into her long- term memory. <br/><br/>With only Anger, Fear and Disgust to guide her, Riley becomes unpredictable, and Joy and Sadness must find their way back before the damage becomes irreversible. Along the way, they team up with Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong, who assists (and innocently misguides) their journey through all parts of Riley's mind including her abstract thought and subconscious. <br/><br/>The praise for ""Inside Out"" could stop at the fact that it's a compelling animated film without a main villain. When was the last time you saw one of those? Case in point. The story creates danger and suspense by throwing new obstacles at Joy and Sadness left and right, creating a sense of doubt wondering what might happen to Riley if they can't make it back to ""head""quarters. Docter and co- writer/director Ronaldo Del Carmen use sheer creative force to fuel intrigue in the other moments.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" is awe-inspiring in the way it fully develops this personified version of the mind and carries it through to fruition with such conviction that none of the loose ends in the concept derail it. This is exceptionally elaborate, demolishing even ""Wreck- It Ralph"" in terms of world-building. From how the mind processes and removes memories to what is going on when you dream, the film is an ever-growing tower of ""what if we did this?!"" ideas piled one on top of the other and it never topples over.<br/><br/>Pixar's trademark tear-jerking, heartstring-tugging M.O. is in place here as well, even if not to the same extent as ""Toy Story 3"" or the flashback sequence in ""Up."" The importance of love and support, the challenges of childhood – the connections the film makes to the human experience are so profound and direct despite such an abstract premise and unusual storyline.<br/><br/>Topped with spot-on voice casting and a visual style that distinguishes itself while remaining true to Pixar's form, ""Inside Out"" is an instantly lovable film for kids and adults, one that current children will grow to love different at each stage in their lives. Speaking of, the bar is quite high for a puberty-driven sequel.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"Anurag-Shetty","10","17","52","8 July 2015"," The best Disney/Pixar movie ever made!
","Inside Out tells the story of Riley(Kaitlyn Dias). Ever since she was born, Riley has had a great life. She has a loving Mom(Diane Lane) & Dad(Kyle MacLachlan), great friends & she loves playing hockey. Riley's various emotions, Joy(Amy Poehler), Sadness(Phyllis Smith), Fear(Bill Hader), Anger(Lewis Black) & Disgust(Mindy Kaling) help navigate her everyday life. However, Riley's perfect life turns upside down when she moves with her family to San Francisco on account of her dad's new job, leaving behind the life she knows & loves in Minnesota. Now, it is up to her emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger & Disgust to effectively control Riley's feelings in a new & unfamiliar city. <br/><br/>Inside Out is an unbelievably unique & incredible film! Never before in the history of cinema, has a movie ever delved so deep into the various emotions of the human mind. Since this movie is animated, there couldn't be a more fun & creative way to showcase the various aspects of a young girl's mind & imagination. Pixar has created yet another flawless masterpiece. This film is by far, their most original & creative story, yet. Being a Disney/Pixar movie, my expectations for Inside Out were sky high. Despite the presence of emotions like, Sadness, Anger & Disgust, my only emotion while watching this movie was Joy, Joy & more Joy. The animation is of the highest standard. The inside of Riley's mind is colorful, full of life & is a visual treat. The 3D adds to the overall experience of an already wonderful film. Director Pete Doctor is at his creative best for Inside Out. The way Doctor has conjured up this story that mostly takes place in a girl's mind, shows how staggeringly brilliant he is. This film is so powerful that, I actually teared up during the final moments of the film. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of comedic scenes in the movie. The voice acting is top notch. Amy Poehler is a bundle of energy as Joy. Phyllis Smith is perfect as the hilariously lethargic & unenthusiastic Sadness. Richard Kind is adorable as Bing Bong. Bill Hader is hysterical as Fear. Lewis Black is vicious as Anger. Mindy Kaling is awesome as Disgust. Kaitlyn Dias is superb as Riley. Diane Lane & Kyle MacLachlan are great as Mom & Dad respectively. The supporting characters are impressive. Inside Out is a must watch for people of all ages(with a little bit of explanation for kids aged 9 & below). Pete Doctor has really outdone himself after Up(2009). The best Disney/Pixar movie & one of the best animated movies of all time. Inside Out is definitely a lock for Best Animated Film at the Oscars. I wouldn't be surprised if it got nominated for Best Film too."

","1. Out of blue, Riley get sad and upset about her parents, like, for what?
2. Joy is really annoying throughout the film, no need to mention more.
3. Riley's parents really do not care about their daughter.
The epic dinner scene: mom could have asked what happened in school with Riley alone, instead of signaling her husband to take over at the table, considering Riley already looks upset."
"vlasov-78794","9","12","34","27 July 2016"," One of my favorite
","After watching this movie it became one of my favorite. Creators managed to merge good idea with humor and dramatic moments(for example moment when BingBong sacrifice himself to help Joy escape, i almost bursted into tears, but suddenly i remembered that i'm 22). I think that movie contains good lesson for children and adults that all things are important and have influence if they exist and we can't just throw or forget about them, because they make us those who we are, i mean Joy's attitude to Sad, further Joy understood it. Joy also a good example of perseverance and positive thinking that's very important. Creators showed our mind from other side and explained how it works in very available way. I watched it in one breath and recommend it to all."

","Inside Out is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film was directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronnie del Carmen, with a screenplay by Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley from a story by Docter and del Carmen. The film is set in the mind of a young girl named Riley Andersen, where five personified emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust —try to lead her through life as her parents move from Minnesota to San Francisco and she has to adjust to her new surroundings.<br/><br/>The film shows a adolescent girl, Riley's emotions. When I watched the film, I sympathize with Riley. The highlight of the film is that Riley grows up as she experiences many things."
"zactac","10","18","56","13 September 2015"," Pixar Has Returned!
","For the past couples of years we have worried Pixar was losing it's luster. With the over-reliance of sequels it appeared Pixar was on a road to no longer producing gems but coal. However, ""Inside Out"" proved Pixar's ""gem making business"" is not over yet, not by a long shot.<br/><br/>The movie deals with a girl named Riley and her move from her hometown in Minnesota to San Francisco. However, the story is mainly told from the perspectives of her five emotions: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Sadness. They all work together to keep Riley normal and work even harder to do this once she moves. However, as is expected, something even worse happens leading to a huge adventure throughout Riley's mind.<br/><br/>Pixar has not just created another enticing adventure for us but also an engrossing coming-of-age story. Yes, it is brightly colored and filled with hijinks of epic proportions but in the end this is actually a very intimate story of a girl leaving childhood. We all remember those days when we realized our childhoods were ending, and those days were incredibly difficult.<br/><br/>As we grow older we find things changes, some small and others big. And the simple truth is change is scary. In fact, it can be pretty terrifying, and that is what Riley deals with in this movie. This is not some story of a girl being spoiled and throwing a temper tantrum, this is the story of a girl finding everything she ever believed in disappearing.<br/><br/>Watching this happen from inside her head makes the adventure all the more thrilling. Throughout the movie we watch as both Joy and Sadness work together to get back to Riley and save her from whatever catastrophe that lies ahead. To do this they find themselves in some very amazing locations such as Imagination Land and (a very inspired setting) Dream Productions.<br/><br/>These locations add even more layers to the story being told here. Slowly we watch as Riley goes from a happy girl to a child falling into depression. It is very dark, serious subject matter for a kids movie to deal with. In fact, if it was any other studio I doubt they would've had a chance to tell this story correctly.<br/><br/>Thankfully Pixar had this story and they knocked it out of the park. They tell the very simple, yet important, truth that it is important to feel all of our emotions. We watch as Riley numbs herself from the pain of what's happened and that takes her to places she would not have gone otherwise. It makes very complex notions easy enough for children to understand while still maintaining the complexity. A remarkable feat for any movie to do.<br/><br/>Of course the movie would not be half as enjoyable if it was not for the wonderful voice cast. Amy Poehler was born to play Joy. It would be very easy to make Joy incredibly annoying because of her perky attitude. However, Poehler finds the right balance to make her very charming. The entire cast was also fantastic. Phyllis Smith was perfect as the downer of the group, Sadness. Of course I cannot forget Mindy Kaling (Disgust), Bill Hader (Fear), Lewis Black (Anger), or Richard Kind (Bing Bong) who were all so wonderful.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" was the return to form everyone has been waiting for. Pixar has always been known for greatness so when they have a story that jumps out even more so than usual, people tend to take notice. This is no doubt one of Pixar's very best features and it will go down as an instant classic. With a wonderful message about feeling our emotions instead of numbing them, ""Inside Out"" goes beyond expectations to create an incredibly mature movie going experience for everyone. Yes, the movie deals with these five emotions, but upon leaving the main ones movie goers will feel will be joy and a little bit of sadness."
"jfeilteau","10","18","56","7 September 2015"," What's Going on Inside My Head?
","I walked out of the theater amazed by this purely original movie that Pixar has made. Watching it you can't help but think what emotion is in control right know? Is it Anger? Sadness? or Joy? Pixar shows how much fun they can make movies but that they also have a big heart, unlike most animated movies now. Pixar crafts this movie in ways that make sense like: why you don't remember when you were a baby, why you remember certain things well and others not so much, and what happens when you feel a bunch of different emotions at once. I had a blast watching The Emotions fight over what Riley should do or say. Over all I had so much fun with this movie and if you haven't seen it yet you are really missing out and I hope you love it as much as I do."
"Troy_Campbell","9","15","45","10 January 2016"," Gorgeous, emotional, intelligent and funny.
","Up there with the very best of Pixar, this clever family film is entertaining and affecting for everyone from young kiddies to grandparents. Centred on an 11-year-old girl's internal struggle between joy and sadness, with a bit of anger, fear and disgust thrown in for good measure, this gorgeously animated effort is sweet, smart and often hilarious. Anyone who manages not to be swept up in the bundle of melancholic sweetness of Sadness has a heart of stone. It took Pixar years to fully realise their physical interpretation of a human's inner workings, and the enormous amount of time, effort and thought they dedicated to it was worth every second."
"bowmanblue","8","15","45","30 August 2015"," A great film for adults (and some kids, I guess)
","Normally, when I take my ten-year-old daughter to the cinema to see a 'children's' movie, I normally just sit there praying for it to end as it's just a load of colourful sentimental nonsense designed to fill an hour and a half's time. My daughter, and most of those who are around her age, all sit there laughing and enjoying the film. I just want to go home. This is because – naturally – children's movies are aimed at children (no surprise there then!) and, as an adult I have to accept that and just go along with it. That was until I saw 'Inside Out.' Here the film seems to be written the other way round. Yes, I loved it. I had a great time during the screening. And, although there were plenty of colourful characters for my daughter to watch, I didn't really think that she (or 90% of the under elevens in the audience) really appreciated it.<br/><br/>We're shown that, right from birth, we have little characters in our heads controlling different areas of our personality – a happy little character for 'joy,' a depressed little character for 'sadness' and so on. These quirky little creatures control and dictate our actions and therefore life throughout our lives. The little characters we meet here reside inside a little girl called Riley's head. And, when she moves house and her life gets turned upside down, the little people inside her mind go on an adventure throughout her body – in particular various aspects of her mind.<br/><br/>And this is where things get a little complicated. Well... not for me, but then I'm an adult. However, some – in fact quite a lot – of the gags start to fall flat on the children's ears when the characters on screen walk into the 'subconscious' and you're treated to the 'horrors' which reside buried deep in all our minds. And this is how it went on. More and more of the story seemed to be designed for those with a least a better understanding of the way our minds work that your average 'Pixar-watching' child.<br/><br/>I've read other reviews and I see that a lot of kids did actually enjoy this film. However, I just wonder on what level they did? My daughter loved it, but the characters were pretty and 'good' was easily distinguishable from 'bad.' Personally, I loved Inside Out and would happily watch it again. I thought it was clever and different. I also couldn't help but think I was watching some sort of Christopher Nolan film like 'Inception.' Adults will love it. Kids should love it. Just be prepared to explain some metaphysical aspects of a Disney film during the drive home from the cinema!"
"evwms","10","16","49","12 July 2015"," A literal emotional roller coaster!
","*slight spoiler warning, just in case: while it's extremely minor, I don't wanna get blacklisted...*<br/><br/>So last night I had the pleasure of seeing Disney and Pixar's latest film ""Inside Out"", and lemme tell ya, it's pretty darned amazing! The story centers around 5 emotions who live in the mind of 11-year- old Riley Anderson: the ringleader Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear. When Riley's parents decide to move from Minnesota to San Francisco, the emotions have to try to help Riley adjust to a new life, and despite Joy's insistence on trying to stay positive, things start to go horribly wrong before long. <br/><br/>Now we all know that Pixar has come up with some genius ideas over the years, but dare I say they put arguably the most effort into this one movie. Without giving too much away, the concept of emotions having a physical form in the mind world of a young girl was executed to near perfection! The visuals of the mind world are stunning, and everything that happens inside Riley's head translates to a completely realistic reaction in the real world. While not the most realistic portrayal of the human mind (but ah, who cares about that ultimately?), I really appreciated the attention to detail that went into this, even going so far as showing how Riley gets a song stuck in her head! From the emotions' Headquarters to the labyrinthine Long-Term Memory to Dream Production, there's a surprise around every corner to ensure you'll never get tired of this incredible world!<br/><br/>Then of course there's the cast of characters which is another nail Pixar hit on the head. The five comedians who voiced the emotions each suited their character perfectly; Amy Poehler played up the perkiness of Joy like it was her second job, Phyllis Smith made Sadness adorable and funny but still sad enough to make me wanna hug her, Lewis Black was pretty much in his element as Anger (minus the cursing, although he does ask about it a couple of times in the movie), Mindy Kaling was fabulously sarcastic as Disgust, and Bill Hader... Pffft, aw man, Bill's performance as Fear just had me in stitches, even though he was mainly getting knocked around or scared in some way.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the most important part of the film, the story. It's very well-paced, surprisingly realistic even for Pixar's standards, and it teaches lessons about one of the toughest things of all: growing up. Change isn't the easiest thing for anyone to go through, especially kids, and there are certainly moments that are guaranteed to tug at the ol' heartstrings. But in-between those serious moments are plenty of light-hearted scenes that will make you smile. <br/><br/>To sum it all up, whether you're a kid, teenager, or adult, this is a movie for everyone. Hop aboard the Train of Thought and get ready for a literal emotional roller coaster with Disney/Pixar's ""Inside Out""!"
"jimel98","10","16","49","7 July 2015"," What a marvelous Gem
","I took my granddaughter to see this and dammnit, I want to see it again. It's funny, simply FUNNY. I won't bore you with a recap of the plot as you can see that about a dozen different places on this site. I'll just give you my take, the opinion of a 55 year old guy. I laughed my butt off quite a few times, and when I wasn't laughing, I was a bit misty eyed.<br/><br/>It's brilliantly written for every age group and anyone who doesn't appreciate the cleverness that transcends age, gender and species (trust me...)you must be one very dull person. Sorry, but that's how I see it.<br/><br/>It shows a situation many have dealt with (moving to a new place and trying to adjust) and even though I've never had to experience that, I've known folks who've had to and this hits the mark. It also hits the mark on the though processes we all face in every day life in a very humorous way and by a wonderful cast.<br/><br/>If you're human (or a dog or a cat...wait 'til the end!) you can identify with this and might find yourself saying....I wonder just how much of this might be kind of true.<br/><br/>And yeah, as I watched it, I hearkened back to ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask"" and numerous similar ""inside the body"" movies. Each has had it's strengths, THIS ONE is strong start to finish."

","Inside Out is quite possibly, if not, one of Pixar's greatest productions. The film is full of humour that not only the adults will enjoy but as it should be the kids too. Full of color, imagination and a brilliant story to boot. Out of the many emotions we feel as humans, Pixar have picked the 5 that obviously we feel the most and have done a excellent job making the characters work together, having their own personalities which are all quite funny in their own way. The story has been well written and it shows that Pixar know what they are doing, like usual. Parents will see their own children and life experiences in this film and can related to it. I highly recommend seeing this film both for adults and the children. Pixar, you've done it again."

","I am a psychiatrist (and mother of 3 young little ones) who has sadly witnessed the devolution of the American emotional intelligence over my lifetime (1970's-present). It is clear that a large sector of the American population (including our politicos) have become allergic to sadness, shunting all appropriate sadness into anger (FYI, the driving force behind these negative reviewers here). Men (especially) tend to be diabolically afraid of sadness and will shunt it to anger. That's why I am so amazed how this movie got it SO RIGHT. The creators must have had a lot of insight and/or input from (good) psychological thinkers. I love the scene with Sadness and the pink elephant -- Sadness listened to him (and tolerated his crying) - yielding his joy. Sadness is cathartic and we are evolved to benefit from this emotion. Listen and be comfortable with sadness. Yay, for Inside Out."

","Inside Out does have it share of small problems, such as a lack of development for some of the supporting cast and a bit of second-act fatigue. However, these hiccups don't really detract much from the overall thematic thrust and inherent brilliance of the material itself. The script is endlessly inventive and insightful in a way few films are these days, and the voice actors are at the top of their game here, especially Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith. Although Inside Out may not quite be the studio's masterpiece, the film is certainly among its finest work (and the best since Toy Story 3 back in 2010). More importantly, Inside Out officially puts to rest any doubts that Pixar is still the king when it comes to delivering meaningful, imaginative family entertainment.

"torfarrells","10","15","46","6 July 2015"," Inside Out's heartwarming tale is one of PIxar's best
","Pixar has proved itself to be more than a children's studio on numerous occasions— entertaining audiences of all ages— but never before have I seen anything so delightfully touching and smart as Inside Out was. Its perfectly layered switch-offs between reality and thoughts generate a mind boggling and colourful depiction of a somewhat normal young girl dealing with moving away. The emotions we see interact on screen are all personalities and features of the protagonist. The film generalizes a simple way to look at the mind of a human— categorizing our emotions into 5 characters: Joy (the gleeful and charming Amy Poehler), Sadness (""The Office"" alum Phyllis Smith), Anger (perfectly exaggerated by Lewis Black), Fear (a charming and frightful Bill Hader) and Disgust (the broccoli shaped scene- stealer voiced by the endearing and relatable Mindy Kaling). The movie doesn't just grab 11 year old girls or San Fransisco hockey players— it grabs all of us, and pulls us in to the extraordinary world of the reality. We need a little Office before Parks and Recreation— we need a little blue before yellow— we need a little sadness before joy, and that insightful little message plays through the movie like a roller-coaster; the disgust of looking at it— the anger of the line— the fear of the drop— the sadness of the long way down— and of course, the joy that follows. A. By Ryan Farrell."

","This is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. I'm glad to see Pixar slowly returning to form, by making charming, original films for the whole family. I've noticed that they've evolved from making movies that were considered ""kids films"" and going into deeper, more complex themes. As the audience who first saw Toy Story in 1995 (20 years ago) has grown up, so have Pixar's movies grown up with them. Pixar does the impossible. They make films for older audiences, while at the same time keeping them appropriate for the children who want to see it. We all know that this will win Best Animated Film at the Oscars next year simply because it has the Pixar name attached to it, but this is one of those times where I agree. (So far. That may change, because we still have Minions, Hotel Transylvania 2, Peanuts, and Pixar's next film The Good Dinosaur coming out this year.) I enjoyed the more subtle bits of humor for older audiences, that 10 years from now kids will rewatch this film and say ""oh, now I get it."" I thought I would be able to predict the plot, but the movie proved me wrong. I was not able to predict any of the plot other than what was shown in the trailers. This is one of Pixar's best. It makes up for Brave and Cars 2. I liked those, just not as much. I wouldn't say those are their best. This movie made me very emotional. (No pun intended) It's definitely a film that little kids won't appreciate as much as older audiences, because it's so deep. There is also a short before the movie called ""Lava"" about 2 volcanoes who fall in love. I thought that was great, too. The whole story was told through an island song which I felt was very unique. That definitely deserves some Oscar love too in the Best Animated Short category.<br/><br/>Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"

","I watched this film due to the fact that it is rated very high so I had great expectations.Those expectations were not met.
The film is slow.Very slow. It has some good moments but it is not thrilling.
Joy tries to prevent sadness from creating sad core memories and therefore they are lost in Riley's memory.They try to go back and fix this before she loses her joy and personality. But it is somewhat ridiculous.
This quest is not interesting. I got very bored watching this.And I like animation, it's just that this one fails.
The idea is interesting but it is not well executed. I do not think that this movie was made for kids, it is more of an adult movie. It is not funny at all. It is depressing. It also makes no sense. Why Riley's parents sold their beautiful house and bought this horrendous house in San Francisco? And why didn't they try to clean their house.The house was awful.It is not a place for a kid to live. And all these weird stuff. Imaginary friends,broccoli pizza, scary clowns. The script is plain and absurd.
I feel that lately animation films are totally drained out of interest and plot. It is not as bad as ""wonderpark"" and ""ralph breaks the internet"".Those films were horrendous. But this one is dull and miserable. Joy wants to bring joy but she is more depressed than sadness."

","For the past twenty years, Pixar have taken us on an emotional ride through the eyes of; toys, bugs, monsters, fish, superheroes, cars, a rat, a robot, an elderly man and a brave young princess. This year though, they may have their most emotional picture yet in the form of Inside Out and this time, it's all about our emotions showing emotion.<br/><br/>When young Riley and her family move from their quiet midwest life to the hustle and bustle of San Francisco, Riley's emotions; Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) go into overdrive.<br/><br/>Together they have to work to make sure Riley adjusts to life in a new city, house and school.<br/><br/>As always with Pixar, there is much more to their films than first meets the eye. The story may sound very basic however, when you watch Inside Out, one of the most impressive things about it is the sheer amount of imagination that has gone into making it such a special film.<br/><br/>The world that the animators have created inside the mind of a child is one of Pixar's best pieces of work yet and everything single one of the emotions fills it with their unique personality. <br/><br/>There is some good voice work provided by the likes of Poehler, Smith and Black but it does feel that both Kaling and Hader are a little underused however, not enough to make their characters pointless. <br/><br/>The script is full of brilliant comedic moments, allowing Black's Anger to steal most of the scenes, and touching scenes that have Joy, Fear, Disgust and Anger wondering what the purpose of Sadness really is.<br/><br/>It is such themes as this and the script that makes Inside Out arguably Pixar's most accessible animation to both adults and children. If you thought the final scene in Toy Story 3 or the opening to Up tugged at the heartstrings, wait until you see Inside Out.<br/><br/>If Inside Out is one thing, it is undeniable proof that Pixar remain the leading animation studio in Hollywood. A title they have been holding now for the past twenty years."
"omorg-pub","10","16","50","22 June 2015"," not as entertaining as some Pixar films, but brilliant all the same
","okay, this is why i loved this movie. it is a BRILLIANT integration of jungian and themes from Joseph campbell in the best tradition of fable telling. There are those (i am one) who believe that fables are metaphorical constructs intended to help/teach children how to deal with difficult emotional realities such as abusive parents, social terrors, and the like. This is an EMOTIONALLY intelligent film perfect for many audiences. Quite honestly, it came along at a great point in my life (and i am a 50yo woman). It reminded me that without Sadness, there can be no Joy. But it goes far deeper than that. It interprets jungian ideas about the sub/unconscious, about repression, about personality, about letting go, about growth, about complexes, shadow work, and gets into memory theory, dream research... so much more... if you are a real student of the psyche, you will see what i mean. and it boils it all down into a useful, affective metaphor. Unlike another reviewer, i did not find it triggered PTSD or depression or anything else. It has helped me accept that i have a lot of buried sadness that I've tried very hard to repress, and that that sadness has a real and valuable role to play in my life, and it may help me move forward in that respect. I don't know if that counts as a spoiler, but i tagged this review just in case."

","I currently have a top-rated comment on Youtube that bugs me every few days as new people like it. I was giving someone flack about calling Inside Out the best Pixar film since Toy Story 3, because that doesn't say anything. So its better than Cars 2 (universally held to be the worst), Brave (the most forgettable) and Monsters University (a prequel that didn't exactly evoke any wonder). Inside Out is a magical film experience and it deserves higher praise than that. The unreachable pinnacle on which Finding Nemo and The Lion King sit now seems so much more attainable.<br/><br/>The voice cast of this film is utterly delightful - Amy Poehler is beyond perfect as the perpetually optimistic Joy. Her voice has been making me smile for years and now it does so in a whole new way. The rest of the cast - from Lewis Black's Anger to Phyllis Smith's Sadness - matches perfectly with their character's design and body language. It doesn't even feel like voice acting, I believed that these were actual creatures who had thoughts and were speaking to each other. <br/><br/>The film's screenplay is an utter delight and I would have to say for the first time I will be outraged if it is not a front-runner for Best Original Screenplay. The beautiful crafting of the emotions and their dialogue to the clever (and utterly believable) bureaucracy that makes up the emotions centre. Sprinklings of meta-humour (the unicorn standing in for a famous actress), nostalgia (the imaginery friend), one-liners (there's deja vu! and blah blah! and deja vu!"") and more adult themes (Riley's return home at the end of the film) show perfect levels of balance and utterly sensational writing quality.<br/><br/>There's not to much more I can say without just listing a bunch of scenes I enjoyed, so I'll keep this one short and say that Inside Out is magical. Its one of the best Pixar films of all time, and its great to see they can still make me ask ""what if?"""

And here, I want to say thank you to all the people who passed by my life, memories that flickered and faded and were forgotten: Thank you for appearing in my life . What is life ah - - joy and sad intersection."

"bankofmarquis","8","1","1","1 April 2020"," The Most Emotionally Resonant Pixar Film
","When listing the PIXAR films that have the most emotional resonance, the films I hear mentioned most often are TOY STORY 3, WALL-E and the first 20 minutes of UP. While all of those are most definitely emotionally resonant, I would argue that INSIDE OUT is the most emotionally resonant of all the Pixar films.<br/><br/>And not just because the main characters in the film are emotions.<br/><br/>Telling the tale of 11 year old Riley, who's life is upended when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransico, INSIDE OUT follows this journey through the eyes of Riley's 5 chief emotions - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear.<br/><br/>As is customary in Pixar films, the voice cast in this film is outstanding. Amy Poehler (well known as the ever-optimistic Leslie Knope in the marvelous TV Series PARKS & RECREATION) is perfectly cast as Joy. Her never ending well of optimism is perfectly placed - and never gets tiresome. As does the voice work of Lewis Black (Anger), Bill Hader (Fear) and Mindy Kahling (Disgust). They are all marvelous. But the revelation of this film for me is the voicework of Phyllis Smith (THE OFFICE) as Sadness. She brings just the right amount of weight and...well...sadness...to her character without bogging down (and bringing down) the proceedings. These 5 work together well (especially Poehler and Smith).<br/><br/>Special notice needs to be made of the voice work of the unique talent that is Richard Kind as the character BingBong. I will not ruin any of the surprise of this character, but I will say I could not think of any other voice for this character - he is that perfect for it.<br/><br/>Credit, of course, for all of this needs to be given to Director Pete Docter (currently the Chief Creative Officer at Pixar). He has shown he has the ability to really tug at the heartstrings with his previous Pixar effort, UP, and he expands on this promise in this film bringing an emotionally rich film that has many, many moments of humor spliced within. He'll be at the helm of the upcoming SOUL and I can't wait to see it.<br/><br/>I'm glad I revisited INSIDE OUT, it is a stronger, better film than I remembered. You'll like it - and your kids will, too!<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","The movie inside out has a unique way to teach us about how to deal with our emotions. It is a good movie because it is cute and adorable. ""This movie is the best! It's emotional, funny, has GREAT animation and more!"" (Bozdech, 2015). I think this is a movie that everyone should watch.<br/><br/>I like it when they show Riley as a little girl and she is very happy and sassy. There is this part where Riley is running around the house and being a little sassy girl because she doesn't want to have her clothes changed. I like it because they have all these happy cute memories of Riley when she was so little and they show it at the beginning of the movie. One of Riley's cutest moments was when Riley's parents were teaching her how to play hockey on the ice and both of her parents were so happy that Riley was going to grow up playing ice hockey. Another cute moment was when Riley had an imaginary friend named Bing Bong who was pink like cotton candy and they always played together and they had a song that would start the wheelbarrow and fly into the air and they played an instrument together. Riley has a good imagination and she loves spending time with her friends and going out with them.<br/><br/>For me, I rate this movie a 8/10 because this move is good and it is cute at the beginning and it shows you how to express your emotions. It is the best movie in the world and I recommend this movie to someone who wants to watch it to see how it is because the movie is so cute and adorable and you would cry when you watch it because some parts are emotionally good."

"ethanbresnett","8","1","1","7 March 2020"," Another jewel in Pixar's crown
","There was a lot of hype surrounding Inside Out, which seems to be a contender for the upper echelons of Pixar's creations, and I can see why. The imagination of the gang at Pixar never ceases to amaze me, and their ability to make seemingly innocuous ideas into masterpieces is wildly admirable.<br/><br/>Like any Pixar film the voice acting was spot on, and Inside Out really delivered with some fantastic voices to personify the emotions running around in Riley's mind. Amy Poehler was a fantastic lead, bringing her exuberance to the role perfectly.<br/><br/>In terms of the plot it was rather subtle in delivering some fantastic messages regarding emotions and how it is healthy and part of growth to feel sadness. The journey of discovery that Joy and Sadness went on was jovial and poignant simultaneously. The world that Pixar created inside the mind of Riley was great, with some fantastic and ingenious ideas in how to portray memory and brain functions.<br/><br/>What perhaps brings this film down slightly for me is how contained it is as a world, and how few characters there are. The story spends a large amount of time focusing on Joy and Sadness, and a bit of attention on some of the other characters or a few additional ones would have been welcome.<br/><br/>Aside from this there isn't much to complain about with Inside Out. A joyous way to spend an hour and a half and another great addition to Pixar's arsenal."

","Truly magic fairy tale, one of the very last masterpieces Pixar made before turning all politically correct. Beautiful, deep, magic work."
"IanAJohnson","8","13","39","6 July 2015"," This film was funny and had a refreshing lesson to tell.
","Inside Out is the story of a little girl named Riley and the little voices inside her head that control her emotions. After Riley's family moves to a new home, the emotions in her head (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) begin to experience some technical difficulties and question the purpose of Sadness. While trying to keep Riley in check, Joy and Sadness get separated from the group and have to try and get back to headquarters before Riley has an emotional breakdown. While I have found the last few of Pixar's films have strayed from their audience (either focusing too much on the children or the adults), this one is a return to form. While there are more then enough jokes meant for children and there are just as many meant for adults. I laughed quite often. The art style is perfect for the concept and the casting was perfect. There is a lot to like, but my favorite aspect of this film is the moral lesson that this film teaches. Not only is the lesson incredibly useful to not only children and adults, but it is truly helpful and a lesson that not a lot of people focus on. There are not many flaws with the film. Most of my complaints are nitpicking at best. The biggest one I have is with the structure of the plot and not the plot itself. It suffers from what I call Armageddon Syndrome (named after the first film that I noticed having this particular issue). A good plot is supposed to slowly increase tension and progress through a series of important moments until it reaches a climax where it them calms down and resolves. Armageddon Syndrome is where there seems to be little to no progress until the final climax. The plot in Inside Out just looped itself for a majority of the film until it felt like finishing. This made the movie get a little boring at times. Joy and Sadness would try some method to get back by going to locations that signify different parts of the human psyche, would fail, and try again until no more jokes and puns could be made. While this is a major, glaring issue with the film, it doesn't detract all that much since the writing is so good. The best way to think of this film is like a road trip across the country. The destinations are fun and memorable, but the drive between them is kind of boring and repetitive. Despite this I highly recommend watching Inside Out."
"jadepietro","8","13","39","2 July 2015"," Mind Set
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4) <br/><br/>This film is recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: Insightful and thought-provoking, but not as mind-blowing as expected.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>Critics have been raving about the latest Disney / Pixar offering, Inside Out. While it doesn't take one to the dizzying heights of animation perfection like the award-winning Holy Trinity of Animation (Toy Story, Up, and Ratatouille), it still is entertaining and insightful, far better than most standard animated films these days. <br/><br/>￼Literally, the moviegoers are given a introspective tour into the mind of an 11 year old girl named Riley. This fantastic voyage takes us into the brain's central work station manned by Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). This quartet of emotions help keep Riley in balance.<br/><br/>That is until Riley's outside world starts to come undone with real-life issues changing her life. Inside, things are beginning to disintegrate as well when Sadness accidentally starts a domino effect that alters Riley's behavior and mood swings. (The fact that Riley is headed for those teenage angst years doesn't help matters either.) So Joy takes over to try and rectify this imbalance causing even more issues.<br/><br/>￼Well directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronaldo Del Carmen, Inside Out is animation with adults in mind. The screenplay by Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and the director, takes an intriguing premise but never fully succeeds in expanding its mind games. And while the intentions are good, the end result is a bit scattered. With all the language about core memories, deductive reasoning, and abstract thinking being bantered about, one wonders if a psychology major is required for the minors in the audience. The film's target audience may have been children, but only those with the highest of IQ's. <br/><br/>The voice-over work is consistently strong, especially Poehler, Smith, and Kaitlyn Dias as Riley. However, while some of the emotions are well defined like Joy and Sadness, the other trio is regulated to secondary roles that are less nuanced. Other major emotions are never even represented or acknowledged for that matter. Paging Sigmund!<br/><br/>￼The real scene stealer of the film (in Freudian terms, our Id) is Bing Bong (wonderful vocal work too by Richard Kind), a pink confection of cotton candy and various animal parts who cries candy tears and was once Riley's imaginary best friend. This character is the heart of the film and the emotional center of Inside Out. The film laments the loss of childhood in the subtlest of ways and effectively taps into any moviegoer's emotional ""core"". <br/><br/>￼The film's animation is as highly accomplished as we expect from the Disney / Pixar Studios. Its textural details and imaginative Rube Goldberg devices show the inter-workings of a child's mind with its floating islands, glowing orbs, and neon lit chutes and ladders...a Disneyland for the mind. Its stylized humans have enough realistic touches to make their characters seem authentic especially in sharp contrast to the cartoon qualities of the more obviously color-coded crew. The musical score by the talented Michael Giacchino superbly links its haunting melodies with the visual images on display. It is also refreshing that this film never resorts to inane slapstick chases and sophomoric humor, so prevalent in today's animation.<br/><br/>￼Inside Out shows the ins and outs of growing up in a refreshing and intelligent way in which adults can easily relate while their young children will pass the time wondering why their parents are enjoying the film more than they are.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","I was able to see an early screening of this movie and had heard that critics were calling it one of Pixar's best. After watching it, I would have to agree. The animation was great(as usual for Disney movies) and the storytelling was clear and easy to understand. But to me, the thing that would make or break this film is the comedy in it. And in my opinion, it was extremely funny. The characters(emotions) in the film are funny and memorable. One of my favorite characters is Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong(my favorite emotion is the hilarious Anger.) There are also certainly some touching moments in the movie but it is balanced with the comedy so as not to be too sappy. For me the only problem with the film is it's scope(the whole movie takes place in San Francisco except the very beginning) and lack of adventure (outside of the mind), but it makes up for it with creativity, comedy, and great storytelling and characters. I would rank this as one of Pixar's top five.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

The movie took me by surprise by the sheer creativity that went into every single detail of the story. It is a very difficult movie to execute and Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen pulls it off amazingly well. <br/><br/>The story takes a look into various emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust) of a young 10 something girl who is brought to a completely new neighborhood and culture - from MidWest to West Coast. <br/><br/>At a higher level, it shows how our emotions play a very important role in our reactions to day to day situations, which is why controlling them becomes all the more important for long term happiness. I loved the boldness of the concept and the imaginative power that went behind writing the script. <br/><br/>The animation is not as great as Pixar's earlier movies but does enough justice to the general benchmark of animation quality that has been set these days. <br/><br/>However, overall, the movie is a great watch for the sake of the brilliant plot and brilliant imagination that has went into creating this amazing movie. After watching it, I started analyzing my reactions against the five emotions and understanding how each emotion would have led to a different reaction to the same situation."

"ferguson-6","9","13","39","18 June 2015"," Yet another Pixar masterpiece
","Greetings again from the darkness. Once upon a time  in 1995 to be exact  Pixar revitalized and revolutionized the world of animated movies with the release of the first Toy Story. In the process, they sent our expectations soaring for each of their subsequent movies. Despite the pressure of such high standards, the creative geniuses at the studio have regularly thrilled and delighted us over the years with classics such as Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), Wall-E (2008), and Brave (2012). And beyond these, there have been a few true cinematic masterpieces – transcendent films: Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Up (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010). This most recent release unquestionably belongs in the latter group  it's one for the ages (and all ages).<br/><br/>Genius and brilliance could be used to describe all aspects of this movie. It's a technical marvel, a visual kaleidoscope of bright colors across the full screen, and most amazingly, it packs an emotional wallop with real life moments for adolescents and parents alike.<br/><br/>My comments will be brief because this is one you should experience for yourself – and probably more than once. Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is an 11 year old girl who lives in Minnesota and loves her parents, her friends, and hockey. She is happy and well-adjusted. When the family relocates to San Francisco, broccoli on the pizza is only one of the challenges Riley must face. This change affects everything for her – no more friends, no more hockey, and a strained relationship with her parents. At this point, you are probably saying ""So what? That's nothing we haven't seen before."" And you are correct, except we have never seen it explained the way Pixar does.<br/><br/>We literally go behind-the-scenes of Riley's brain and see the control panel of her emotions. There is a constant battle between Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black), and the ring-leader Joy (Amy Poehler). This is an exploration of emotions and memories, and the explanation has some scientific merit. Memories are depicted as marbles, and Riley's favorite things are shown as islands (Sports Island, Friendship Island, etc). How emotions affect memories is the key point here, and especially how sadness is necessary and vital to our joy. Have you wondered why we forget our imaginary childhood friends (Riley's is Bing Bong, voiced by Richard Kind)? Have you wondered why our memories change over time, and are impacted by our emotional state in any given moment? This animated gem will help you understand.<br/><br/>Director Pete Docter (the genius behind Up) has a daughter of his own, and he clearly ""gets"" the emotional changes brought on during the pre-teen years. His research, and that of co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen, takes us on an adventure that should inspire much conversation between parents and kids. And even if it somehow doesn't break the ice in every family, it will at a minimum help youngsters and parents better understand the link between emotions and memories  plus, they will probably share a good cry and a bunch of laughs along the way. Hats off (again) to the Pixar geniuses. I dare you to top this one!<br/><br/>***NOTE: you should also look forward to another Pixar tradition – the pre-movie short film. This one is a very unique short entitled Lava."
"eferhild2010","5","14","43","3 November 2015"," Nothing here for adults.
","I like animated films but usually if it's PG you get some inside adult jokes but nothing but childish thoughts here. Stay away if you expect a Shrek type movie. The acting is good and the story is great for kids but I was disappointed that there is nothing here for adults. If you are going to the movies to pay premium prices and expensive candy then the adults should get some enjoyment as well. I think this is the worst Pixar film to date. Remember Adults pay for the time, money and the time it takes to make the money to go see a movie. Don't waste the adults time here. Certain adults I can understand would enjoy this film but mature adults will not enjoy this film in the theater. Wait to get it on Blu-Ray and leave the room while your children enjoy this good movie for them."

","Must see if you ask me. This movie shows how emotions work in your mind. They took an example of how the emotions work in the brain of a girl until her teenage years. It will teach you that every emotion is important, even sadness. Because it is OK to feel sad sometimes, get it all out. You have to have a balance. The fact that it is an animation movie does not mean its (only) for children. But I think that this can be a beautiful way to teach children (and everyone really) about emotions! I think it was about time that they dare to make a animation movie like this. With a deeper message. It is a big surprise to me that some people don't like it. Probably because they didn't expect an animation film to be this educated. <br/><br/>Really beautiful and fun movie!"

Although they made a great job, easy for children and non- expert adults, they missed very fundamental areas of the mind as executive control and volition, including our capacity to regulate emotions!...

"SpoodermanDerp","9","14","43","16 August 2015"," An Emotional Stir
","""Inside Out"" is directed by Pete Docter, starring Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith marking Pixar's 15th feature. Right off the bat, this film is imaginative and creative. The concept is, of course, original and it isn't a surprise since Pixar has some great story boards. However, what makes this film special is that, even with it's creative concept and premise, if you simmer it down, it really is just a simple and heartfelt story. It's about an 11 year old girl who loses her core memories and Joy and Sadness in the process. Now they have to get back before she does anything stupid or lose herself, but as usual it becomes a fun adventure that still plays with our heart strings. <br/><br/>The first half of this film was bent on introducing the concept and the imaginative world of what goes on in our brain. For some people, it felt tedious, and granted, it does feel a little bit like that in some few parts of the first half, but nonetheless it was understandable considering they had to introduce a whole new world which was inside our heads and they did a pretty great job at doing that when the film progressed. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith were both great in their respective roles as Joy and Sadness. Seeing how these two different emotions begin to mix up and play along together was a great idea, seeing how obvious having these two emotions together will result in great chemistry and entertainment. The way each and every emotion/character was handled differently and that worked for the film. Another great aspect of the film was that it was relatable. Riley's character was simple, yet she was relatable to children nowadays and reminded the more older audience how they were when they were younger. <br/><br/>Moving on, the animation in this film is spectacular. Pixar's previous film ""Monster's University"" had such a rather realistic rendering of the characters and the surroundings, however Pixar takes it up a notch and the animation style improves furthermore in this film. The surroundings looked much more vibrant and colorful, each character design had a special and unforgettable feature to it. Pixar once again creates a beautiful and transcendent world to ponder on.<br/><br/>As for the story, it's one of the simplest, yet creative stories Pixar has ever done. In it's close 1 hour and 30 minute run time, the film is a straightforward adventure. Joy and Sadness need to get back her Core Memories before Riley ends up destroying her life and her mind as a whole. That's where the story kicks in and some ups and downs are made. When you think about it (pun intended), it's really just a story of an 11 year old girl coping with her problems and because of that simplicity and with great execution from Pixar, we got one of the most heartwarming, touching, moving and poignant film they've ever made. If you simmer it down, this film isn't about some convoluted story about Monsters or Cars or Superheroes, it's a simple story about emotions and family, nothing more and nothing less. That's the beauty of this film. <br/><br/>Even if it were just a simple film with a simple story, it did not fail in touching our hearts like any other Pixar film bringing us to near tears, if not, into full tears. It was already a given that this film would get our emotions running, because it's a film about emotions. But even if it were a film about emotions, I have to say, it surprised me to find out that a simple story like this could get you to clench your heart and nearly cry. Even if for some people that don't cry in this film, it's impossible not to relate and feel your heart be warmed when watching this film. At the end of the day, this was a great comeback for Pixar and it shows that even after 20 years, they still don't fail to create original and intriguing worlds and touch our hearts at the same time.<br/><br/>+Creative concept and premise, +All around fun adventure, +Joy and Sadness, +Spectacular Animation, +Unique characters and surroundings, +A simple, yet touching story at it's core.<br/><br/>Verdict: 9.3/10"
"v-04938","9","11","32","26 June 2016"," Incredible characteristic settings
","Inside out will be my best comic movie in 2015 as for the incredible settings for a person's characteristic. The movie combined so many element together and doing this in a splendid way. We all know that when a baby first come to the new world the baby is always crying, but as we saw, Riley came to this world with the first emotion, joy,I like this cause I just felt that it's great to come to the world,but then sadness comes and makes me cry. That's why baby is crying. And when we were younger,our feelings and emotions toward a thing is much more clear,happy or sad or angry or disgust or scare,but when we grow older,the feelings and emotions became complex,we are not just happy or sad or angry or disgust or scare toward something but more like to be some feelings or emotions combined together,because we are getting older and the feelings won't be clear as the old times,that's what grow told us. The trailer is so fun it told us about the people Riley met and how the 5 emotions in their head controls them,but psychologically we know that emotion is not can be simply divided into five but is far more bigger than this amount, but the five in the movie is fine enough to explain all the things. Thought train won't work when we were sleeping,the clown is so scared, dream was actually made by the people in our head and cloud town,all of this is so fun. And lastly, we all once had a bingbong in our head, but after we grow up we just left bingbong behind our memory."

"Unvoiced-Apollo","8","13","40","10 July 2015"," Everything you could expect from Pixar - almost
","This movie is definitely a return to form for Pixar. It has just about everything you want from them: Family Friendly (for the most part), a concept that has been done before but with a story that takes that concept to the next level, and story that will tug at your heartstrings.<br/><br/>What is the story about? It's a story of an 11 year old girl named Riley who has been uprooted from Minnesota to live in San Francisco. However, we come to care about her through her emotions, mainly Joy and Sadness, which are personified. Belling the story through her emotions, Pixar is able take us through a journey of the mind. <br/><br/>The animation, the voice, and the score are all spot on. My two criticisms, and these are really nitpicks, is that at times I could really feel the movie slow down and I wish they explored the different areas of the mind a bit more. I know slow moments are necessary, but it was noticeable. That said, when the movie was going, it was a wild ride of fun and emotion. I also wish they had explored the deeper recess of the mind a bit more, but I understand this might have made things too complicated for a film that us meant for a more general audience. <br/><br/>If your kid is of a young age and gets restless easily, this likely isn't going to be a movie for him or her. However, this movie offers a great lesson to the young and old (one many adults tend to forget). This is actually a film I would say older kids and adults will get more out of, but I recommend it for anyone that can handle this type of movie.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful film that the the family can enjoy and a great addition to the Pixar cannon. 8/10"
"Filvies144","9","13","40","6 July 2015"," Pixar may be coming back.
","Lately, Pixar hasn't created anything considered perfect since Toy story 3. Cars 2 and Monsters university weren't great and didn't live up to others. But now we have this film, which is one of two Pixar films this year.<br/><br/>When I saw this film, there was a theatrical short called ""Lava"". The short was actually awful, un-entertaining, and was like a romance music video. I give that one a 2/10.<br/><br/>OK, on to Inside out. The film was fun, funny, and even a little complicated like the Toy story films. Before this film was released, I really doubted this film, thinking the concept would be unappealing and the writing might not be good. But this bashed my low expectations. I liked the adventure in this film because the backgrounds were excellent and made me feel like I was either in San Francisco or inside Riley's brain. The animation also made the emotions look cute, but the thing about this film is, like other Pixar films, it starred human characters in it, but the animation just creates good looking humans because its not always a good idea t make your animated film look as real as possible like ""The Polar express"". As for the characters, the emotions are sometimes funny and a little lovable. One problem is that I feel like the emotions have emotions of their own. Like there are scenes where Sadness and Anger smile like they're happy. That makes no sense since they're supposed to feel their own emotion since Joy is called Joy for example.<br/><br/>This film doesn't have a good theatrical short, but it is still great movie that makes up for Pixar's previous disappointments (Cars 2, anyone?), and manages to blow away doubts. I hope Pixar continues this comeback with the Good dinosaur this Fall. Kinda hard to believe that Pixar would release 2 films in one year when during previous years it would be one at a time. <br/><br/>Update July 26: When I created this review 3 weeks ago, I noticed a lot of negative reviews even though it has a 8.7 average rating. Its sad to see it have all this undeserved hate. At least tons of others have the critics point of view for this film. Plus, all this hate is coming from people who thought it was ""sad"". Sure they do have an opinion but this movie is still clever even when some parts like Bing bongs entire storyline is sad. If you watch the first 10 minutes of Up, you may understand that sad is sometimes sad in a good way. I can't wait for its home release then I can watch it over and over again.<br/><br/>Update: This stupid troll is still going. Its down to a a8.4! WHY?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd like to thank the people who gave this at least a 7/10. Its beautiful and heartwarming and deserves to be in any animation hall of fame. Its just amazing<br/><br/>SO DON'T LISTEN TO HATERS, EVERYONE! JUST BECAUSE ITS MORE SUITABLE FOR OLDER CHILDREN DOSEN'T MEAN ITS A BAD FILM! <br/><br/>Oh, and one more FYI, its better for kids then that horrible Cat in the hat movie (This film has no adult jokes).<br/><br/>Story: 9/10 Animation: 9/10 Characters: 10/10<br/><br/>9/10"

Although the movie is about emotions, I for one couldn't find myself to care. At times, this felt like a Pixar movie, but it easily could've been made by any other studio. I bet it wouldn't have been as hyped or even held in the same high regard if it were another animation studio. All in all, I WAS entertained by this movie, but it just didn't have the same energy or feel that previous Pixar films have had.

This new concept has definitely been a success for the movie. There should be more movies like this, where there has actually been some thought put into the film. During the movie it is evident that personal memories are important and influence who we are and how our emotions effects our memories.

Never did i expect to be this moved by a movie, not to mention that it still managed some absolutely hilarious moments.

It's suitable for the whole family- yes, a statement often incorrectly applied but here fully justifiable. A children's film? Yes- children will love its simple cartoon characters. An adults' film? Yes, too- snappy dialogue, clever witticisms. With cross-references or hints of ""Wizard of Oz""; a bit of Woody Allen cynicism; a dab of office life antagonism; cubist art analysis; family tensions; and a heap more. I've seen it four times now.

","I just recently went to see this with a friend, and I loved it!!! I was a ready to bring out the tissues, just in case, because I read many reviews that it was very sad, but it is not as sad as people say it is. I do believe that this movie is better for ages 8 and up, just because it can be confusing, but the animation is worth it. There are only maybe 3 really emotional scenes, but that varies on your child. I would recommend having a talk with your child after the movie, so they understand all the emotional content better. There are some sad scenes, but there is a lot of humor as well. It is an excellent movie. The younger kids will probably love the animation most of all. Highly recommend."
"Finfrosk86","8","12","37","30 June 2015"," Fun, entertaining and mostly really smart.
","Caught an early screening of this at Cinemateket, Oslo. Nice! Because it premieres here in late August. Wah-wah.<br/><br/>Having seen several good reviews and scores, I went into this expecting something pretty great. Albeit, I also heard great things about Up and Toy Story 3, which I found to be overrated, but in this case, what was said, was mostly true.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of really smart writing. The main idea is really good, and all the small details are super fun, the story in general, as in plot is nothing too special, but it works.<br/><br/>But as I said, what really makes this stand out is the smartness of a lot of the jokes and ideas. The big jokes, main jokes, if you will, I didn't find all that funny, but the small details, those made me chuckle. A chuckle that both said: that's pretty funny, and wow that's really smart.<br/><br/>Funny thing, a couple of times during the movie I thought to myself, 'ah, so that's how my brain works'. Haha, then followed by, 'no wait, we know emotions aren't tiny creatures living in our brains'.. right? My point being, it's really plausible and well made.<br/><br/>The animation is of course superb, didn't expect anything less. The voice cast is also top notch. <br/><br/>I did find a couple of things with the script to be a little lazy, actually, and really felt it took the movie down a notch. I was rather surprised at some parts, well one in particular, giving the fact that most of the movie is so smart.<br/><br/>I had heard that it was supposed to be very sad, or touching in some parts, but it didn't really get to me as much as I'd hoped.<br/><br/>(not trying to be tough here, I love being touched and sad by movies)<br/><br/>All in all this is a well made, entertaining, smartly written (for the most part) movie with heart. Well done.<br/><br/>How soon will the sequel be announced? and spin-off? This could potentially be a huge franchise."
"jreddavis","8","12","37","29 June 2015"," Wonderful Film With Some Hardcore Emotions, Certainly Worth Seeing
","It should come as no surprise to any movie-goer that Pixar has created a film that takes a thought-provoking topic and presents them in a way that is both entertaining and emotional. Inside Out explores the idea that our actions are controlled by our emotions, which are determined based on the opinions of tiny, energy comprised characters in our heads. More than that, Inside Out looks into one of the most difficult points in a person's life: pre-pubescence. More accurately, it looks into what life is like at that transition when we are no longer children, but just starting to become the ball of uncontrollable emotions that is a teenager. Personally I found the film to be quite relate-able, and I think most can connect with it in some way. It looks at a time in life where we are all vulnerable, when emotions aren't as black and white as they used to be. Inside Out helps us recall that move, or that transition, that change that spurned a new era in our life, whatever that change or era might be. The animation is also visually stunning, with Pixar animating a world they have yet to explore, that being our own reality. However with such an expansive world, the animation can at times be spotty, although there were no noticeable imperfections within the mind of the main character Riley. Because Riley is an eleven year old girl, audience members over the age of 10 have a better chance of connecting with her story. That is perhaps the films greatest flaw, for most go into a Pixar movie (or most animated movies) assuming that it will be clean family fun that will entertain children of any age. While Inside Out is entertaining for most everyone and appropriate for all ages to see, the content is a little heavy and might go over some younger children's heads, especially because the story centers around a time in life when most are about 12. There are several slow parts in the movie and even with all the laughs, one does tend to walk out of the theater with a sense of melancholy rather than that of pure laughter. It's a wonderful film and brings many great emotions to life, both on screen and off, but if you're looking for simple family fun just to make your kids laugh, there are other options. Hold onto this movie though, and if you're the parent of a teenager than I guarantee this movie will make you cry. I know I did. All in all though I think that with this movie, Pixar has captured that old magic and put some new spins on their classic formula, making for a meaningful, heartfelt film."
"spckn_sh","9","12","37","23 June 2015"," Good Movie! I don't know why people think kids won't understand it!
","When I first seen the previews for this movie I did not want to see it, but I'm glad that I did. This has been one of the best animated movies that I have seen in a while. Contrary to what some reviews say, I believe that this movie is perfectly suitable for younger kids. People underestimate what kids can understand. I am a Pre-K teacher (teaching 3-4 year olds and some 5), and they understand that they have emotions and that their emotions make them feel different ways. In fact discussing emotions is one of the first lessons that we talk about, and almost everyday we talk about how each other is feeling for any particular day and how its okay for us to have emotions. Sure there where some parts in the movie that might be a little to complex for them to understand, but in reality when kids watch movies they hardly ever understand everything in the movie. For example, we watch The Lorax for a movie day at school, and I had to explain to the kids at the end about recycling and taking care of the earth why it's important and how it helps the earth, because most of them came away with a different understanding. But that's part of growing up and maturing, I can watch movies now that I watched when I was younger and get a completely different understand, because I know more now and I understand more. I don't think the previews did this movie justice at all. There where some depressing parts (I even teared up some), but the movie had a wonderful plot and story line. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
"rgkarim","9","12","37","18 June 2015"," From the Inside Out it is all Pixar
","We all are victim to our emotions, always susceptible to a tantrum or sobfest that overruled our logical side. The trigger for these outbursts can vary in form, a bad day at school, a breakup with a boyfriend, or in my case sitting through bad movies. Whatever the cause, have you ever stopped to picture what is going on in your mind to cause this? Pixar has, and their latest film has brought those thoughts to life in a way only their studios can. Today I review Inside Out and take a look at what creative sparks lie in their studio. <br/><br/>Pixar has been on the sequel train for quite a while, so I was thirsty for a drink from the original pool. Inside Out emerges from that source we fell in love with years ago, and brings it back ten fold in the world of young Riley's (Kaitlyn Dias) mind. Inside Out is a beautiful personification of the inner workings of the mind, filled with colorful visuals that pop off the screen. A high tech ""head""quarters for the cortex looks like something from Star Wars, where futuristic control panels govern all the memories and thoughts that govern our being. Outside command central, Pixar gives you more of their magic in their creations; forming a maze for long term memory, a movie studio as the source of your dreams, and an obvious train for your train of thought. Tacky as some of the puns are, Pixar puts their wit back into the game to design a unique world that is sure to entertain many, as well as become the next theme park attraction. <br/><br/>As the emotions transverse the chaos that is our brain, Pixar not only takes you on a physical adventure but an emotional one as well. Of course being a kids movie there are a lot of comedic moments that had me, as well as other audience members, laughing. Slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one liner puns that will appear in memes, and plenty of witty dialogue that represents the internal struggle of indecisiveness. In particular Anger's (Lewis Black) ranting had me laughing the hardest, as the simplistic yelling and rash threats to curse were to my tastes. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) had to be my second favorite, more so in how she presented her lines with that perfect twist of depression to make it funny, and yet sad at the same time. <br/><br/>Yet while comedy is a big portion of this movie, Pixar/Disney always manages to bring other emotions into the mix. Seeing as one of the emotions is Sadness, you can guess there are a few moments that can bring tears to your eyes as Riley's memories unfold before your eyes. Joy offsets these moments though, with beautifully crafted sequences that cover those special times in life. And all of it is edited together at just the right times to make the emotions hit home, building slight tension, but delivering a satisfying finish. Pixar represents this emotional instability both inside Riley's mind and outside in her actions, really capturing the look and feel of someone troubled, hence the title. It's balanced well with the humor, and gives older audience members a tether to the film to keep their interest. <br/><br/>Voice acting though is the factory that really brings things to life, as each emotion is matched with their voice counterpart. Poehler's optimism shines bright in joy as she rambles off her ideas to keep Riley happy, and you can feel the actress in the character. Phyllis Smith brings her character to life, her whispy voice selling the hopeless emotion, and yet still bringing a comedic edge to her lines that made her humorous. Lewis Black is perfect for anger, his ability to play heavily angry roles where his character consistently yells has been established, and he fits right at home with the emotion he plays so well. Mindy Kaling as Disgust was another good choice, the shallow, image obsessed emotion playing strong to that sassiness we love from her. And Bill Hader cleans up with fear, bringing the anxious tone of fear, while also providing that dry sarcasm. <br/><br/>For all the good this movie has there are a few quirks that took away from this movie. The first is a few of the jokes are beaten to death and lose their comedic intensity. In addition the trailers have also given you a lot of the funny moments, which for those who are heavy Disney watchers will be lost from the constant barrage of commercials. As a movie overall, Inside Out has some decent editing, but there are times where the editing needed to be tweaked. The ending of the movie was very drawn out at times, and lacked suspense for me because of the obvious ending to come. I would have liked them to sacrifice some of the prolonged and slower scenes, and give us some glimpses at the personality islands they kept bragging about, or perhaps more time in the darker recesses of the mind. Diving into that creativity may have offset the predictability a bit, and played to the strengths of this movie more. <br/><br/>Overall I was impressed with Inside Out and loved to see Pixar's classic performance shine once more. Audience members of all ages are sure to enjoy this film, with the younger generations laughing in high shrills and the older appreciating the emotional side of things. It holds that creative magic we love of Disney, and keeps you entertained despite some of the longer moments. While not the best, Inside Out certainly shows promise for the studio's future works and more fun adventures to be had. I would say it is worth a trip to the theater for any age group and strongly recommend you see this film. <br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Animation/Comedy/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"
"rafabedran","9","12","37","16 June 2015"," Manages to be complex and smart while still fun and charming
","Inside Out is Pixar at its best. It's an engaging idea that takes on pretty complex subjects and turn them into a fun ride without dumbing them down, but actually subverting them into humorous situations (and of course there's the heartfelt and tear inducing moments we came to expect from the studio's features).<br/><br/>In the film's world, every person has inside their minds 5 emotions: sadness, joy, anger, disgust and fear. Each with its own personality and desires. They also habit the ""world of the mind"": there's the cave of the uncunscious, the islands that defines our personality, a fantasy world and etc. The creativity put into this film is so great it reaches both adults and kids without having to recur to subtle profanity to get adults wry smiling or pushing an overly cute character to get smaller children giggling.<br/><br/>The five emotions that live inside the girl Riley have to deal with everything she goes through in life, but these things assume other forms inside her mind and its so curious and exciting just seeing how her memories, desires, relationships, nightmares, expectations and all kind of experiences take shape in this inner world and are dealt with.<br/><br/>What truly makes Inside Out a great movie is the amount of subtlety in each situation and character. For example, the fact that Joy is yellow but also has blue hair (the color of sad). The way it shows us that each emotion is essential and part of life and how the whole time they interact with each other making our existence confusing but at the same time so rich and complex. The movie wittily materializes and personifies things that goes inside us that we may find sometimes hard to explain and gives us a whole new and imaginative view on how we feel and think - and it does that with remarkable simplicity and inventiveness.<br/><br/>Inside Out will probably have a sequel (maybe more) and that's a great thing in this case, because the whole idea is so intriguing and full of possibilities. After seeing this film you may actually start imagining these characters rambling in your mind and talking over each other."

"wdngo","9","14","45","8 October 2015"," Awesome
","With the recent Pixar movies, it seems to me that they are putting more effort on trying to intrigue all ages not just only children anymore. This movie is about a young girl moving into a new city as her emotions navigate her decisions. One emotion which is Joy get into a conflict and is in search of a solution but while she is on this journey she learns a lot about Sadness and her part in the young girl life. As she evolves on this journey, as do the other emotions and the young girl. First off, the images and sound play a huge part in this movie as it adds all the emotions needed in the pictures. It gives us a different perspective in how our emotions bleed out to others and how creative we forget we can be. The director does well in this part as he gives different scenes that are out of this world mostly on Joy journey as you would not expect most of the stuff happening seeing greed, selfishness, and others which you wouldn't presume to happen in a ""young movie."" He gives you a different picture on life and how generally our society forgets how we could view it from all different sides. The director also actively engages the audience as Joy goes on a journey to rescue the girls Morals or Personality that she obtain throughout her life. Certainly A movie that made me tear up is a first as it is hard for a guy to cry sometimes. What could have been worked on is the music as it should really amplify more of the scene rather than a little aggression. Some felt like it was lackluster as it was a powerful scene. As for the voices of each character, I believe it was splendid as Angry had the right tone of voice and sarcasm. Disgust had this almost blonde personality but what really gave in was Bing Bong played by Richard King, he put so much emotion and thought in his voice that it felt so real in the movies. The usage of colors allows more eye candy in the different section of the movies that appealed to the audience giving them not a monotone view but at time vibrant for happy feeling and same suit color for sadness. Overall this movie 9/10 as there is some part that are a little off but the plot, character, and voices were on point. Other than that the movie is about 1 hour and 30mins giving it a perfect time for the plot to end, nothing I felt was rushed as everything flowed nicely. This movie oddly relates a lot to our daily lives as our emotions get in a way with a lot of our decision-making comprising some paths that we choose but also how we deal with other people in our daily lives. Our choices and voice make big decision in other views as working with others to make a better place."

","Brilliant 10/10 Joy was really cool and together the emotions aced what I imagine is really going inside our heads! I wish I could get to know my emotions. I think Sadness was well played by Phyllis Smith, her voice is great for the part. I think Disgust couldn't have been more perfect o really like Mindy It's a shame that Disney didn't properly assign emotions in as much detail as they did Riley She has details emotions And the dad too But overall this film was really good would Watch again a lot My brother and sister loved it I would love to see a sequel I hope they make one maybe with a different character Who knows I really want to see these actors in more hints"
"brookeymaree","10","14","45","12 July 2015"," Best children's movie in a long time.
","I did not think this movie would be as good as it was, to be honest. It is a perfect portrayal of basic psychology, of growing up and trying to make sense of our emotions. Those saying that the story writing was weak or that the characters were generalized, open your eyes. Riley is a ""typical"" mid western girl, with what seems a charmed life. Those asking for diversity, get over it. She is a generalized character. Its impossible to make a character that every single person will relate to 100%. No one is crying about Andy in ToyStory having an equally vanilla and privileged life. The reason Riley seems to have such a charmed life is because it shows a great contrast between feeling happy and ""normal"", to feeling how she does when joy and sadness go missing. It shows that no matter your situation, as good as it may be, everyone experiences different emotions. Even the ""happiest"" people feel sadness, fear, disgust and anger. Some people have said that those 5 emotions are not enough to represent how the mind actually works. Well obviously. Riley is only 11, that's the point. Her emotional intelligence is limited at this stage. Which is why at the end of the film we see that her memories can be mixtures of all emotions. That's the whole point!! It shows that emotions can be tied together and that what we feel can be complex and a mixture of many feelings. I believe this is a perfect demonstration of growing up, and a great way to describe how emotions work to an 11 year old. At such an age where hormones are running wild, she's growing up and encountering new life challenges. This is an extremely stressful time in ones life and can be very confusing. After the stress and embarrassment of moving to a new town, crying at school, hearing that your only friend has moved on already, feeling inadequate at the sport you love and feeling frustrated at your parents for moving her there. Its natural that these feelings are going to be represented by disgust, fear and anger. At times in life, it does feel like all joy and sadness have escaped us. Some say that Riley catching a bus to run away is unrealistic. How? Plenty of kids get the urge to run away. That's not a new concept. Its the logical conclusion for a kid who hadn't developed a great emotional understanding yet. Plenty of films have used the idea of running away. The scene of Riley getting on the bus to leave really makes you worried for her. Very powerful writing to immerse the viewer into the diageses. This movie shows that that is completely natural to feel emotions other than joy and that it shouldn't be shamed. Another comment questioned why Riley's parents emotions look like them but Riley's don't, perhaps its because her parents are more mature and have a sense of self as they are adults. They've already gone through what Riley's going through. Riley is only young, she hasn't figured out who she is yet, which is why her islands of personality change too. Also note that her mums Sadness is in charge and her dads Anger is in charge. Perhaps over time our emotions work out their hierarchy to define who we are, although Riley is ruled by joy now, as most children in her position would be, as they generally live in ignorant bliss and haven't grown up yet and don't understand their emotions yet, perhaps Riley will be ruled by sadness eventually, as we see joy let sadness have her place towards the end. This doesn't mean that she will be sad all the time, it just means she is aware of it. As they show in the end, you can have sadness and joy at the same time. I don't see why this is hard for people to understand.. Someone mentioned that Riley's dads emotions are just stupid and angry and not engaged, and that her mums just long for a life they didn't have and that they should both be more complex. No. This story is about Riley and her emotions, her parents are only thrown in for a funny scene. Same as the emotions at the end of the movie in the credit reel. Just for comedic effect but still showing that everyone else feels like we do too. Those saying that Bing Bong was an annoying unimaginative character- he was thought up by a three year old girl!! That's the point. He even says himself that he's mostly fairy floss and animal parts because that was all the rage at that age. He looks ridiculous because he's the figment of a toddlers imagination. I think people need to open their eyes and see what a masterpiece this film is. No other film has shown the process of growing up in such a clever way. And how could you not laugh at the ""facts and opinions get mixed up all the time"" line?? Probably the kind of people who think their opinions are fact.. The whole visual representation of the subconsciousness and the forgotten memories is extremely powerful. Bing Bongs passing, or being forgotten is a very significant metaphor, showing that we all grow up and move on, and that its all a part of life. Children need to understand that all of their emotions are valid. Many children's movies have adult themes, and Inside Out is no exception. Its a very mature concept, that it seems even a lot of adults are not grasping. Excellent film for lovers of the mind"
"jdgw","10","14","45","7 July 2015"," Excellent movie.
","I find this to be a rather adult movie that kids can enjoy.<br/><br/>For me the interesting thing, and for what I read from other reviewers who are young, its the powerful metaphor it delivers as it tries to explain how the mind works!<br/><br/>Take note how each of the feelings plays and interact with whatever is happening on and you will find interesting details that indeed they do happen when one looses grip.<br/><br/>For instance, take note of Anger that once he is determined, he disregards any advice from fear, which is in last chance to reason.<br/><br/>It also explains that interpretation depends on how you look at things and that having your main emotions on balance is key to better livelihood... and while its not scientifically what really happens in the brain, the metaphor does tell you why you forget details, why some stick, and more or less how is that odd thing called attention is working.<br/><br/>Its a fantastic movie."
"DoubleOscar","10","14","45","6 July 2015"," Pixar Returns to Form with yet another Masterpiece
","I was always anticipating Inside Out. I knew that sooner or later Pixar would be back on track making great movies once again. I was not a huge fan of their past few works (Namely, Brave and Cars 2). Also, some of the trailers for Inside Out didn't really do it for me. Some of the jokes seemed forced and the slapstick humor seemed to be aimed a kids. Boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>This movie was phenomenal. Everything worked for me in this film. It's the most I've ever been touched by an animated film since the beginning of Up. Also, this is one of the funniest Pixar movies to date. The slapstick humor (what little there is) blended perfectly with the surprisingly larger amount of more adult humor. <br/><br/>The story follows a young girl, Riley, as she is uprooted from her home in Minnesota and has to move to San Francisco. Simultaneously, the story focuses on the five emotions (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust) in her head, and when Joy and Sadness get accidentally shot out of headquarters an adventure ensues that shows Joy and Sadness's journey back to headquarters. The story is perfect for both younger and older audience members because it is so relatable. Anyone who has ever felt any kind of emotion will be any to relate to Riley and what she is feeling.<br/><br/>As for the cast, this is one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a while. Specifically, Lewis Black as Anger. That is the definition of perfect casting. Furthermore, none of the emotions outshine the others, they all get their fair share of laughs. Even the emotion I was most worried about, Disgust, voiced by Mindy Kaling, had me laughing. The rest of the casting, consisting of Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, and Phyllis Smith as Sadness, all were nearly flawless with their voice acting.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside Out is another masterwork from Pixar and is easily the front-runner already for the Best Animated Feature category at the Oscars and maybe even Best Picture. This film met all my expectations and gloriously surpassed them. It also has me looking forward to The Good Dinosaur, another film by Pixar coming out later this year.<br/><br/>""These are my kind of people."""
"suppishnaruto","10","14","45","1 July 2015"," A Love Letter to Classic Pixar Movies
","Inside Out is arguably the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3; it brings a refreshing look that reminds us just what type of studio Pixar is. I was actually surprised by how mature some parts of this movie were. To make a shallow comparison, Inside Out is like Adventure Time in that it can awaken that childlike wonder and joy that you might lose in your daily life, while still making you mull over incredibly deep concepts. I think this is a movie that both adults and kids can watch, that it doesn't just cater to the whims of children, but rather respects, in a very much Toy Story way, how a child's view of the movie might develop as they grow up.<br/><br/>As we've come to expect from Pixar, this movie is visually stunning. The close-up shots really capture emotion well in an animated film. The story takes you inside the head of a pre-adolescent girl, Riley, and personifies her emotions in a movie that is truly a breath of fresh air. Inside Out reminds me of the Pixar I knew as a kid, the studio that had amazing, original ideas and presented complex issues and a beautiful way. We come into a very difficult stage in Riley's life, and we are reminded just how easily your world can fall apart when you are so young. Inside Out really shows you the stress we all endured at that point in our lives, how youth can seem so fleeting and that at times it may seem like we've forgotten what joy was.<br/><br/>Lastly, this movie made me cry. While not exactly the ""tear duct sledgehammer"" that Up was, Riley's character is strikingly relatable, which makes the movie hit deep in its own way. I rarely give movies a perfect score anymore. I rate movies on a adjectival system, meaning each number 1 through 10 has an adjective associated with it; a 5 is mediocre, a 6 is okay, a 7 is good, you get the idea. To me, a 10 is a masterpiece, a movie that beautifully does what it set out to do; while a 10 may not be perfect, it will definitely be remembered and looked to as a model. To me, Inside Out fits this description. I would recommend this movie to anyone who still has a little kid inside of them."

","Inside Out (2015): Dir: Pete Docter, Ronaldo Del Carmen / Voices: Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling: Another Pixar masterpiece and with a theme regarding emotions. Riley is a teenage girl struggling with the recent move of her family. Her passion is hockey but her hopes are in the dumps. Inside, her emotions attempt to maintain her sense of being. There is Joy, voiced with good cheer by Amy Poehler, and she tries to maintain the positive. Phyllis Smith voices Sadness whose touch can upset the balance. Bill Hader voices Fear, Mindy Kaling voices Disgust, and Lewis Black steals moments as the tempered voice of Anger. Central plot regards the misplacement of several memories and Joy and Sadness stranded outside headquarters struggling to get back. As Riley falls deeper into a depression, the islands of her brain slowly self destruct. These island include Family, Friendship, Passions, etc. Along the way they encounter Riley's forgotten imaginary friend, Bing Bong who is made up of various animals including elephant, dolphin, cat, etc. He cheerfully helps the duo get to the Train Of Thought but many obstacles prevent them. This is a colourful and creative family adventure that addresses the very core of our being and how we respond to things. Tension constantly builds as Joy and Sadness, and eventually Bing Bong are road blocked constantly by despair before true heroics set in and emotional balance is set. This is another winner by Pixar and it scores on all levels of emotion but mostly joy. That is how viewers will likely react upon seeing it. Score: 10 / 10"

It's not a bad Pixar film though... This movie makes you feel. If it didn't do that for you, well you mustn't have any core memories. Lol No Seriously rarely is there a movie that makes you feel as if you've grown as a person for watching it, so watch this movie .......my review is too short so I'll add that each emotion is clearly going to have its flaws AND strengths, that's the whole point of the film (tiny spoiler) joy thinking sadness would ruin everything but sadness was compelled to do what she did because she knew Riley needed to go through it, and joy didn't understand that having thought she needed to be happy all the time, by the end we see that's too stressful of a burden and that we all need to feel all the emotions.

"MrDHWong","9","14","46","15 October 2015"," A strong return to form for Disney Pixar.
","Inside Out is the latest animated feature film by Disney Pixar. After their previous three movies (Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University) failed to impress me, naturally my expectations were quite low. However, this worked to my advantage because I can say that this is one of the best films they have ever made. It represents a strong return to form from the legendary animation studio.<br/><br/>Riley Anderson is a young girl who lives a happy life with her loving parents and friends in Minnesota. Guiding her through life are Riley's personified emotions; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. However, at the age of eleven, Riley and her parents relocate to San Francisco after her father finds a new job there. This change in location and atmosphere comes as a shock to young Riley and her emotions desperately try to help her cope with living in a new city, going to a new school and trying to make new friends, with sometimes disastrous results.<br/><br/>This is one of the most clever, poignant, touching and original films that Pixar have made to date. I loved the concept of how the emotions in our heads know what is best for us and are trying to navigate us through life. Also, its moving story about acceptance and change will strike a chord with anyone who has moved someplace different and have tried to fit in and adjust to a new life. I would even rank it alongside Up and the Toy Story films in terms of how emotional it can get. My only real issue is that some of the film's themes may be too complex for really young viewers but I guess as long as their parents are with them to explain some of the more difficult to understand concepts then there shouldn't be a problem.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10."
"alixj248","10","14","46","2 August 2015"," Highly Unique and Inventive, this may go down in Western Animation History as one of the Best films for Creativity and Emotion next to Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Up
","Even the great Pixar seems to be underwhelming audiences after Cars 2 Brave and Monsters University failed to please. (Though I like 2/3 of those okay) This is were ""Inside Out"" comes in. This is an idea that has been done before,so the concept of people inside a body controlling things we don't even think about isn't new at all. However,director Pete Doctor (Up, Monsters Inc) has taken this idea and added a fun, new brilliant creative spin on it that is just too wonderful for words. <br/><br/>Inside a baby's head, we see a glowing figure emerge, yellow dress and blue hair. bundle of Joy. The person presses a button to which the baby smiles,thus creating her first emotion Joy.Years later, we see Riley Anderson growing up and doing what most girls do, play, laugh, hang out with friends, have some family time and Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler,)watches it all and loves it. There have also been more emotions that joined ""headquarters"" in that time, a timid blue girl in a turtleneck named Sadness (Phyllis Smith, The Office who deals with Riley's problems the easy way, a red brick man named Anger (Lewis Black,) who helps her to achieve things even if it be through forced, Disgust,(Mindy Kaling,)a cute girl clad in green who helps Riley to refuse foods such as broccoli or picking the wrong outfit for school and a thin purple man with large worried eyes named Fear (Bill Hader) who stops Riley from hurting herself or getting into danger. Together the emotions work together, even if they don't all get along to keep their girl happy and healthy. Until of course she reaches eleven and the trouble starts after the family move from Minnesota to San Francisco,and new problems arise. <br/><br/>The film's animation is just-Spectacular. There's really nothing else to call it. They show memories in the form of multi coloured orbs each a colour for a different emotion, e.g. Joy yellow, Anger red. There is a scene in which Joy and Sadness wander through Long Term Memory which is just an endless twisting row of shelves full of different coloured memories. Someone got to animate that, draw, paint and render every single frame. <br/><br/>The characters are all brilliant, colourful and memorable. Maybe not Toy Story memorable, but people would still recognize them. Joy is well...joyful. Amy Poehler as Kaling puts it ""is light incarnate"" and she's right! She adds such a warmth and upbeatness to the character while not ending up being annoying. Phyllis Smith as Sadness is one of the best casting choices I have seen in a long time. She is morbidly funny, she is adorable, cuddlesome and very smart, (she was the only one who bothered to read the manuals) Lewis Black as Anger. Spot On! You could feel the energy in his voice, yet you still loved this gruff,grumpy character who could still be funny in his own way. Mindy Kaling as Disgust was great to! Very sarcastic and shallow but not in a mean way, almost in a ""It's my job, deal with it,"" kind of way. Bill Hader as Fear was golden! His nervous voice fit so perfectly with his character's comical movements and delivery that you just felt so sorry for him while laughing as he screamed. <br/><br/>Bing Bong, a half cat, elephant, cotton candy, dolphin, candy crying hybrid who was Riley's friendly and loving imaginary friend when she was little. Although she doesn't have use for him now that's she's eleven, he still stays in her Imaginationland. When we first see him he is stealing memories and appears to be far more cute and willing to help than anyone else. At first glance, you would go ""Oh, well much like Lotso, King Candy and Hans he's a villain because of his deceiving appearance."" You would be very wrong. Bing Bong wants to help Joy and Sadness back to headquarters so they can help Riley as her islands of personality start to collapse. He is a pure, Winnie the Pooh meets John Candy type of hug-gable, funny character voiced by the amazing and warm. Richard Kind. Richard Kind certainly is a very kind man in interviews and even more so as Bing Bong. <br/><br/>The most powerful scene in the movie is in Memory Dump. Joy and Bing Bong have fallen in. Joy sits in a pile of fading stones, picks up the memories she can still see and begins to weep. ""Do you remember when she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring? I could listen to her stories all day."" She realized what it is like to be sad and breaks down from the years of her being patronizing to Sadness who she sees no use for. Joy remembers Bing Bong's rocket was thrown into the dump and they use it to escape. Unfortunately, Bing Bong is fading. Joy is an emotion- she cannot be forgotten. He however fades away after jumping off the rocket. ""Take her to the moon for me...okay?"" I was sobbing in my seat. Pixar I thought Dory's Monologue was sad and the beginning of Up and Jessie's abandonment but you made me cry over an elephant cat hybrid who's imaginary! <br/><br/>I'm shocked by the user reviews on here with such negativity like it was too sad or too dark or little kids couldn't understand it. Well,it's not for little kids, it's aimed at older children, perhaps even those around Riley's age in the film. It's far too complex for a three year old. An eight year old would probably be able to understand it, but I would put this film at a 10+ to be honest. It's just so smart. I enjoyed this, and let me just say, your own emotions will be running around headquarters going haywire after watching it. Welcome back Pixar, we've missed you!"

"yodercasey","8","12","39","26 June 2015"," A fresh new idea from Pixar, appealing to both kids and adults.
","In their early years of feature film production, fans would flock to see the newest Pixar film. From toys to monsters, to fish, to superheroes, Pixar never failed to deliver a fun, creative idea. In recent years, however, the production company has found itself in the sequel race that has overtaken the box office. After disappointing sequels to Monsters Inc. and Cars, and a princess story that didn't grasp in Brave, along with Disney's success with their own 3D animation, we are forced to face the question: Is Pixar losing their touch? Pixar now returns with Inside Out, a refreshing new idea that will leave few to doubt that Pixar can create a fresh, creative idea.<br/><br/>On the surface, we aren't given much as to the depth of this film. The idea that we all have these little characters of emotion in our heads is creative, but one can't but wonder: ""Can a whole film ride on this idea?"" Rest assured that this film has a lot more depth than shown in its promotions. <br/><br/>Inside Out tells the story of five different emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, who operate the command center that is the mind of Riley, a young girl from Minnesota. When Riley's family moves to San Francisco, California, the emotions must work together to help the young girl cope with growing up and transitioning into a new home. Directors Pete Docter (Monsters Inc., Up), and first time feature director Ronaldo Del Carmen certainly deliver the fun and emotion that fans should expect from a Pixar film.<br/><br/>Pixar paints an excellent juxtaposition between the mundane human world and the complexity of the human mind. One the outside, the film presents a very drab setting to Riley's San Francisco life, an uncharacteristic setting of the normally captivating Pixar. The mind, however, is a vibrant world that is an excellent blend of organic, mechanical, industrial and fantasy all while maintaining the core of neurology. <br/><br/>Audiences will enjoy the colorful cast of characters (both literally and figuratively). While remaining confined in a single emotion, the emotion characters are still dynamic enough to develop throughout the film. As for the human characters in which these emotions inhabit, they are only shown in glances throughout the film, yet they are given the depth which makes them accessible to the audience. The film also delivers on its casting. Who else could encompass Joy better than the bubbly Amy Poehler? Or who could show the rage of Anger better than the ranting Lewis Black? <br/><br/>Where Inside Out, shows its weakness is through the film's lack of aggressiveness in humor. Its jokes are definitely geared towards the older viewers. The jokes hit the nail right on the head in precision, but at times the delivery is so subtle that it can be easy to miss. <br/><br/>Pixar delivers in a unique way in Inside Out. Straying from traditional Disney adventure, the film's conflict is not rooted by an antagonist. Instead it is driven by the compassion that it presents to the limitations and difficulty of human nature. It is a colorful adventure for kids all while delivering an emotional roller coaster that adults can relate to."
"ThomasDrufke","9","11","35","21 June 2015"," Sweet Emotion
","It's incredibly difficult to find a film that legitimately succeeds in making you feel all the emotions that it sets out to. I don't think there was a moment in the film where I thought that the film missed on a joke or any of the emotional moments throughout. Quite often you will see a film miss on something, but Inside Out hit on all levels. Quite simply Inside Out is not only a return to form for Pixar, but one of their most imaginative and groundbreaking films. It's up there with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films as one of my favorites.<br/><br/>It tells the story of young Riley, who is forced into a new move from Minnesota to San Francisco and her emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger struggle with the best possible way to treat all the various obstacles that go with a new move. For starters, Riley isn't the prototypical lead girl, she plays hockey, (not to mention that her teeth are not perfectly straight) which you don't often see with a Hollywood picture, and she's just generally an awkward kid. I think this created a much more naturally complicated story of not being able to fit in. I really enjoyed the family aspect of the film. Both the bonding that the emotions do to ultimately become closer, and the presence of Riley's parents. It's one of the first Pixar films that I can remember where we have both parents actually there for the main characters conflicts, and it worked really well. Sometimes it worked to the point where I got teary eyed, which is not abnormal for a Pixar film. But what I thought was more impressive is that the film never relied on something that was overly emotional to bring us to tears. Where Up, Toy Story 3, and Finding Nemo have more dramatic moments, Inside Out is simply about a normal conflict in a little girls path to growing up and moving on. But yet, there were at least 3 moments tear jerker worthy.<br/><br/>Much like other Pixar films, I think everyone can get something out of the film at different points in their life. As fun as it is for little kids to watch Joy and Sadness going on an adventure to save Riley's emotional state, it can be equally as interesting for adults to understand what the brain of a pre-teen girl looks like. After all, the director Pete Doctor stated that the film was conceptualized based on his inability to understand his daughter's thoughts. Not only is the story appealing to multiple generations, but they enter into the minds out other people of various ages and demographics throughout the film to create some of the funniest moments in the film. Whether it was the dinner table conversation between parents or when a boy meets Riley and his emotions go bonkers, the film nails emotions on so many levels. This film is so inventive in creating a beautiful world where we can not only potentially learn something about ourselves, but have fun doing it.<br/><br/>In addition to having a wonderful story about moving on and accepting change, Inside Out contains some of the coolest Easter eggs and references any Pixar film has to offer. Who thought we would get a Chinatown reference in a kids movie? Or hidden Hitchcock posters in 'Dream Studios', which is also equally as funny as it is a nod to how impeccably true it is of Hollywood. Or what about those barely noticeable newspapers that Anger was reading? Or how can I forget the brilliant voice cast led by Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith. And of course the now veteran Pixar composer Michael Giacchino who gave us yet another beautifully emotional score. Inside Out is one of the most fun summer films and quite possibly best of the year so far. It's near a lock to win best animated feature and a likely candidate for best picture come February.

"bigconoruk","10","13","44","10 July 2015"," The real Pixar returns to revive it's inventive glory!
","Astonishing animation. Inventive and complex concept. Perfect voice acting. That is the formula of Pixar that is used in almost every film Pixar has ever produced. However, after Toy Story 3 came out, the formula isn't really used properly in Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University. Just when we thought it's the end of the glory of Pixar we fell in love with, Pete Docter's Inside Out came along in Summer of 2015 and thanks to critical acclaim, it revived Pixar's glory using the formula as perfect as our favourite Pixar movies. The movie was simply splendid and clever and undoubtedly one of the best films 2015 has to offer. Of course, there are other stuff that has a same idea this movie does. (Like the Numskulls) But, I think this movie stands out the most.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's dive into the film. The film takes place in a mind of a 11-year-old girl named Riley, who is controlled by 5 emotions, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. Inside her mind, all the places represent Riley's personality and the place called Headquarters, where the emotions live, is where emotions and recent memories come to Riley.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, there's a lot of things to go through about this movie but it's worth it! Starting off with the concept, many things in the centre of the concept are genius like emotions use these crystal ball like memories to make Riley remember moments from the past and there's the place where Riley's dreams were made and those dreams are screened at Headquarters for the emotions to watch like a movie. That is so smart! The animation is simply amazing and it really deserves an achievement. The glow on Joy makes me question how the animators do that on a character. Speaking of the characters, all 5 emotions in Riley's mind are probably one of Pixar's most lovable characters in an original film. Disgust is well designed, Anger and Fear are really funny, Sadness is well voice acted by Phyllis Smith and Joy is my personal favourite character in this film. She's chucklesome, cute, admirable and Amy Poehler is perfect for the voice acting!<br/><br/>Now, the story. I won't tell you the story because I want to keep the anticipation in you if you want to see this movie. Overall, the story delivered a lot of scenes with different emotion states. There are some happy moments, there are funny moments, there are moments that might as well leave you shedding tears quite easily. I didn't cry but it moderately hit me.<br/><br/>Inside Out is one of the best Pixar films ever made and I highly recommend it. If you love Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Up, I'm sure that you'll never be disappointed with this one since it has a clever concept, brilliant voice acting and most importantly, impressive animation!<br/><br/>We beg you Pixar to keep this glorious journey of inventiveness and emotion going. Keep it up, Pixar. Don't let us down ever again!<br/><br/>Film Score: 10/10 - Masterpiece"
"bob-the-movie-man","8","12","40","29 July 2015"," Brilliantly inventive but not the 10/10 of the trailer
","Pixar excel in making multi-layered films that can be enjoyed by kids and adults in equal measure. They have also developed a truly astonishing ability to tap into a parent's deepest emotions, such that while their kids were quietly enjoying the first few minutes of ""Up""; Jessie's song from ""Toy Story 2"" or Andy leaving for college in ""Toy Story 3"", their parents were sobbing hopelessly into their sleeves. Inside Out, the new Pixar animation, is a very subtle case in point. And it's also far too clever to be wasted on kids.<br/><br/>Inside Out chronicles the middle-class trauma of 11-year old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) who has to leave the bucolic charms of Minnesota (did she never see ""Fargo""?) to be dragged to the uncultured wasteland of San Francisco, and forced to cope with the 'horrors' of a new house, a new school, yada, yada. So far, so yawn. Except that we experience all of this through the emotions in Riley's head brought vividly to life by Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. Sitting – Star Trek Enterprise style – at a console somewhere behind Riley's forehead, they watch what's going on and control her emotions to suit. <br/><br/>When things go badly awry, Joy and Sadness are pitched out of the control room and dumped into the depths of Riley's long term memory (an area bearing a shockingly multi-coloured resemblance to the Hall of Prophecies in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""). With no joy or sadness in her life, how can Riley cope? There follows a desperate mission to return Joy and Sadness to the HQ, aided and abetted by Riley's long-lost imaginary friend Bing Bong, before her life is permanently wrecked by bad decisions.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives on this film. Inside Out is enormously inventive. If the Indiana Jones series drove an interest in kids doing degrees in Archaeology, then the same could happen for Psychology as a result of this movie. At the very least, you can see how kids with issues of anger management or depression could really get genuine value out of this simple movie by visualising and therefore understanding their problems better. The sociological impacts of the movie might actually be quite profound.<br/><br/>All the leading actors lend their voices to very believable characters, with Diane Lane (Martha Kent from ""Man of Steel"") and Twin Peak's own Kyle MacLachlan also being very effective in voicing Riley's Mom and Dad respectively. The animation team do a splendid job in rendering both the wild excesses of Riley's brain and the seedier foggy streets of San Francisco. <br/><br/>Michael Giacchino again comes up trumps with a moving and highly effective score.<br/><br/>And that trailer. Boy, that trailer! If I ever wanted to see a film more this year after viewing a trailer, it was this one. Brilliantly zipping from Riley's brain to the Mom's brain to the Dad's brain and back again, and making ""Brazilian helicopter pilot"" a defining synonym for day-dreaming and lustful women.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, and slightly disappointingly for me, this sequence was also the best bit of the film. We spend 90% of the rest of the film inside Riley's head. And whilst there are wildly inventive moments in that world – for example, while she sleeps, the day's memories are being dispatched to long term memory, and the Hollywood style movie studio kicks into dream productions – some of this running time is borderline dull. Whilst kids will no doubt remain mesmerised by the antics, the comic potential of the interplay between the emotions in different people's brains is barely tapped again. (Almost in recognition of this lapse, we get treated to a very amusing mid-credits sequence zipping in and out of human and animal brains). If there is a sequel to the film (and it's notable that the console ""puberty"" button was never hit), then with any luck John Lasseter will instruct his team to provide more of this type of content: there is comedy gold to be mined there.<br/><br/>On possibly a purely personal note I was also rather distracted by the animation of the hair of Joy and Sadness: perhaps it worked better in 3D than 2D, but it looked to be a bad photoshop paste effect to me.<br/><br/>As I mentioned up front, the film is subtly moving. An important lesson it teaches ('teaches' like being hammered round the head with a candy-covered truncheon) is that it's ""OK to be sad sometimes"". Do you remember the time around age 11 or 12 where you grew up just enough that Christmas Day didn't seem QUITE as thrilling and exciting as it did when you were 6? And didn't that cause those joyful present-opening ""core memories"" to be tinged ever so slightly with a haze of nostalgic sadness? This film amplifies those feelings through a prism of faint regret, and older viewers should be prepared to shed a tear or too over the lost joys of years gone by. The genetic code of ""Up"" was clearly preserved in amber and emerging at random. You have been warned.<br/><br/>So in summary, ""Inside Out"" is a great film and well deserving of your cinema dollar, but perhaps a smidgen disappointing in its execution when set against the overall marketing hype, and particularly the bar set by that glorious trailer. It will still make a fortune for Disney and Pixar though, and good luck to them.<br/><br/>Finally, the Pixar short – Lava - tells the musical story of an old Pacific volcano seeking the love of his life, and is an animated delight that had me grinning from ear to ear. I just lava-d it! Do NOT arrive late. Do NOT miss this.<br/><br/>(See the graphical version of this review at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address there to receive my future reviews.

"bschultz_the_pally","8","12","40","20 July 2015"," Grade: A-
","When I first heard the concept of Inside Out, it didn't make any sense to me; it just didn't sound like anything that could be made into a film. The early trailer showed that the execution would be possible with the emotions being represented by different characters. Walking into the movie theater though, the doubt came back. How on Earth do you make a movie about characters that are designed to be one- note?<br/><br/>As soon as Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler, came on screen, my confidence was restored. Her uplifting personality, though it could have been an obnoxious comedy device, instead allows the audience to view life with a sense of awe that only a child can experience. Vicariously, the audience is able to revisit childhood literally through the lens of a girl through which we see the world. But Joy is not the only emotion inside her.<br/><br/>Soon Fear (voiced hilariously by Bill Hader) joins in, and then Anger (voiced by scene-stealer Lewis Black), and Disgust (a rather forgettable character and odd choice for a primary emotion, voiced by Mindy Kaling), and Sadness are part of the group that controls how this young girl sees the world. Sadness appears to be the antagonist- though she is funny, all the memories stored inside that she touches become sad memories, and she can't seem to help herself.<br/><br/>In an attempt to save an important memory, Sadness and Joy get lost inside the girl's mind, leaving the controls to Anger, Fear and Disgust, and these characters manipulate this girl during a critical event in her life, and everything seems to fall apart. For every step forward Sadness and Joy take, they fall two steps back.<br/><br/>The way that Disney/Pixar presents the different aspects of the mind are hilarious, clever, and easy to understand (ex: two boxes of facts and opinions, respectively, fall to the floor, and without sorting through them, they throw facts and opinions back into the boxes, mixing the two up). A hilarious running gag throughout the film about a catchy jingle makes for many laughs throughout. The film toys with abstract concepts and delivers one of the weirdest scenes in a Disney/Pixar movie. And the addition of a former imaginary friend, voiced delightfully by Richard Kind, provides both laughs and many heartfelt moments of forgotten childhood.<br/><br/>As funny and original as I found Inside Out to be, I couldn't help but feel the movie tugging too hard at the heartstrings. Too many times did a character pick up a memory and look on it fondly with tears in their eyes; too many times did a character make progress, only to be shot across the girl's mind somewhere further from their destination. Instead of feeling sad, like it was clearly intended, I felt frustrated. And while the movie was filled with genuine, heartbreaking emotion, it tried just a few too many times to make me feel nostalgic. Children may find the movie either too serious or too sad, and adults may find it too deliberate and manipulative.<br/><br/>Despite this, Inside Out is far from being a failure. While very little actually happens in the outside world in regards to plot, the weight of the actions that do happen are felt so much more because we understand the complicated emotions under the surface. Inside Out is the type of movie that shouldn't work; one-note characters that state exactly what the character is feeling and why, and yet, it's pulled off with this effortless magic that only Disney/Pixar seems to be able to achieve in a decade that's been slightly less fruitful than the past two for the company. The movie not only overcomes the obstacles inherently built into the script, but it transcends the problem of one-note characters and gives more character dimension than most films. Inside Out is arguably the best Disney/Pixar movie since Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"brystonmama","6","12","40","26 June 2015"," Brilliant, Sad & Complex but NOT a kids movie
","It was great movie and I loved the way it showed how memories and emotions mold our personalities but the complexity was too deep for a kids movie. As a parent I was an emotional wreck and found little comfort in the ending. The story was beautifully written but I will not be watching it again. I don't want to be reminded how precious childhood memories of my kids will fade for them and they will have less pure joy as they grow. Six is for the few comedic moments and great story but it is not a favourite Pixar movie. Far from it. I would watch Big Hero 6 multiple times even though it has some heavy moments. It at least didn't forget it was a kids movie."
"CinemaClown","Null","11","36","1 July 2015"," A Swashbuckling Return To Form For Pixar Animation Studios!
","A swashbuckling return to form for Pixar Animation Studios, Inside Out arrives as a strong jolt of freshness from the talented minds responsible for groundbreaking classics like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille & WALL·E, commences the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory, and in the process also reaffirms why Pixar is the most beloved, respected & finest animation studio on the planet.<br/><br/>One of the most original, creative, intelligent, stunning & brightest ideas to come out from Pixar's repertoire in a very long time, Inside Out brims with sufficient dosage of intriguing concept, engaging storyline, rich characters, heartfelt emotions, gorgeous animation, stellar voice-cast & evocative score, and is an amalgamation of everything that has contributed in this famed studio's meteoric rise to the pinnacle of the animation film industry.<br/><br/>A heartfelt tale about the difficulties of growing-up, Inside Out follows Riley: a young girl whose life hits a bumpy road when she is uprooted from her Midwest lifestyle after her father begins a new job in San Francisco, following which her emotions — Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust & Fear, work together in an effort to navigate her through this tough phase and help her adjust to her new life in the new city, house & school while Joy does her best to keep her happy.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Pete Docter, Inside Out hits a third consecutive home-run for the director of Monsters, Inc. & Up, for it not only works as an inventive & imaginative feature film from the creative filmmaker but also succeeds as one of the most ambitious & audacious film projects undertaken by Pixar. The screenplay also wonderfully intertwines the two story lines set within the same picture; one concerning Riley while other following her emotions.<br/><br/>Production Design team does a splendid job in creating the world for the emotions to reside in. Even those emotions are cleverly imagined, designed & rendered on the screen, and it's easy to identify one from its shape & colour alone. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera to capture every action in fine detail while its colour palette makes exquisite use of five different hues, each associated with a certain emotion, whose shades are applied to the whole world within the mind.<br/><br/>Editing unfolds its narrative steadily & its 94 minutes of runtime is briskly paced. The score is composed by Michael Giacchino but isn't as memorable as I expected. The performance by its voice cast continues Pixar's tradition of coming up with a fitting ensemble that infuses new life into its animated characters and amongst all, it's Amy Poehler & Phyllis Smith (the voices of Joy & Sadness, respectively) who impress the most, share a wonderful chemistry, and are the very soul of Inside Out.<br/><br/>But despite getting most things right, Inside Out isn't without its flaws for there are a few elements that don't work out in its favour. First is its attempt at humour which at times feels forced. Next up is Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong who is pretty annoying for the most part. Michael Giacchino's score is a letdown too as mentioned above. And finally, there's this contrast between its seemingly childish humour & the subject matter that's more oriented towards grown-ups, which hinders the overall enjoyment on few occasions.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Inside Out is the strongest Pixar film to surface on the big screen since Toy Story 3 that guarantees to take its viewers through every emotion and absolutely delivers on that promise. It shows that growing-up isn't always a fun, carefree experience and also illustrates the importance of sadness in our life as well as the changes any emotion can trigger in our behaviour. I'd been waiting a long time for Pixar to come up with a cinema like this & while it may not be as perfect as their finest works, it's destined to become a Pixar classic in the years to come. Don't miss it."

"t-de-groot1","10","13","45","27 July 2015"," Best Pixar ever
","In my fifties, i have always been a great pixarfan, from the start. Toy Story 3, Up, Ratatouille (amongst others) all knew how to be warm without being corny, funny but never going for cheap laughs, wise and intelligent without being patronizing. This movie however added a lot to the already impressive list of Pixar qualities. The visualization of our mental faculties was so smartly done(if i was to teach psychology i would start the course with this picture), the humor was sometimes so surrealistic and weird, the emotions stayed so well in character ;-), the craft that was necessary to make this was overwhelming. My son asked me to name movies of comparable genius and i had a hard time naming one. Or i have to compare apples and oranges, which i won't do here. (animated movies that come to mind here, right now are Spirited Away and Mary and Max) Anyway, without exaggerating, this was a work of art that makes life worth living"
"adampape","6","12","41","22 June 2015"," Sorry guys, Pixar isn't back yet
","So I saw Inside Out and I really enjoyed watching it. Now if you're wondering why I only gave it a 6 it's because I am basing my rating off how good of a film I think this movie is rather than my how much I enjoyed it. My enjoyment rating would be a 9, I had a lot of fun watching it and also the animated short at the beginning was pretty good. This is not a bad film at all but unlike everyone is saying I don't think it is a fantastic one, I see it currently has a 100% on rotten tomatoes, and I do not think it deserves that.<br/><br/>Now when it comes to Pixar I am not really impressed with them anymore. Their more recent movies have decreased in quality and other animation companies have really stepped up their game and been improving. I can definitely say I think How to Train Your Dragon 2 is better than Inside Out. I am sure that I am not the only person who thinks that Pixar has been on a decline because I think we can all agree Cars 2 was only made to sell merchandise, and even die hard Pixar fans can say Brave wasn't that great. The whole appeal to Pixar and why everyone liked them so much is because they were original and stood out from the competition. But lately they have gotten very formulaic and they most commonly rip off their own movies. Another reason Pixar was so good was because of their superb animation, but lately other animation companies are starting to look just as good. Pixar has always had fantastic texture and environment design, and with Inside Out this is still true but nothing really stood out and their character design needs to be better if they want to stay ahead of the competition. Lately you can see a big trend of them doing sequels like Toy Story 3, Cars 2, and Monsters University, and we are getting even more with Finding Dory, and Incredibles 2. And they are doing this only to sell millions of dollars in merchandise. So you can see my problem after I said that what made Pixar great was being original. When I saw the trailer to Inside Out, what worried me was they did the whole ""hey we are Pixar, remember all those movies we made that you love!"" I honestly think if they hadn't done that the movie wouldn't have been as anticipated and it could've been advertised as a DreamWorks movie.<br/><br/>So as in terms of the actual movie, there was nothing that I particularly didn't like about it. It's just that many things were not as good as it could've been and it was also predictable and many characters and elements were not as interesting as they should've been. I thought the plot was a little predictable, and there were some conveniences and events that felt a little lazy. like how each of the islands fall just as they got to them, or how the island crashes into the Train of Thought while they are on it. There are a couple things that don't make sense, like how losing hockey island makes Riley suddenly suck, I thought it was just part of her personality, and not her abilities. And how she sometimes acts bipolar, like one moment really happy talking about her childhood, and then later she is crying in the middle of class. And when they lose the islands of personality does that literally mean she has no personality, is she just a hallow person with no personality and feelings about anything. I know in that these are minor issues and shouldn't be taken so seriously in a kids movie, it's just when everyone is saying that this movie is tailored a lot towards adults and deals with something as complex as the human brain, I can't help but wonder about these things.<br/><br/>I would say that the biggest problem that this movie suffers from is with the characters. Now the characters aren't bad and I actually liked all the emotions and thought they were funny and they were terrifically voice acted, it's just that you don't care about any of them. A large part of this issue is with the fact that they are literally emotions so you know how they are going to respond. Fear is going to be afraid, Anger is going to be angry, Sadness is going to be sad, and so on. The only person that shows other emotions beside the one that they literally are is Joy who has the most diverse personality among the five of them. It's just hard to relate and care about a character when they are bound to feeling and reacting one way throughout the entire film. Also a problem is that the human characters that you can actually flesh out are given the least attention. The hardest human character to care about is actually Riley; this is because you know that everything she does is the emotions inside her head. And since these emotions are actual characters in the movie it makes it seem like they are controlling her and Riley has no free will at all.<br/><br/>I know it may seem like I am really hating on this movie but I'm not. There is much enjoyment to be had in it and if you are looking for a family movie to take your kids to they will love it. I just can't overlook the fact that this is a Pixar movie and therefore could've been a lot better when compared to their older movies. I grow more concerned for Pixar's direction as a company when they keep releasing unoriginal and underwhelming films. This is an alright movie and I did enjoy more than a lot of Pixar's more recent films, but unfortunately this is not a return to Pixar's glory days."
"cdip90","8","11","37","26 June 2015"," Inside Out: An interesting look on what if feelings had feelings?
","Pixar's latest film tells the story of Riley by showing us exactly what's inside her mind. There we meet Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who operate ""Riley Headquarters"" and don't always agree. Joy is the voice of reason, always wanting to keep Riley happy, while the other feelings are repeatedly stepping on each other's toes to control Riley's emotional response. The banter between feelings will have you laughing out loud for most of the beginning of the movie. Everything in Riley's life is going great until her family decides to move. This move drives 11-year-old Riley into emotion overload, and we as the audience get to see this firsthand. Joy and Sadness are tossed into the deep recesses of Riley's mind, where the ""Alice in Wonderland"" type of fantasy is happening. The jokes are great, the story really interesting. The middle lags a bit, but overall, the movie is an interesting new take on a young girl's emotions."
"meshjoy","10","13","47","31 December 2015"," What's With The Hate Lately?
","The recent reviews I've been seeing for this film are completely and utterly ridiculous. I understand that people are entitled to their opinions, but the reasons people are coming up with to dislike Inside Out are just silly. <br/><br/>One person, if I remember correctly, stated that Disney should ""stop putting adult themes into their movies"". Also, another said that this movie is too ""depressing"". Are you serious? What do you expect Disney to do? Just make every character bounce around and sing goofy songs? Disney has ALWAYS had adult themes, and Disney ALWAYS has included sad moments. Remember Bambi? That movie was made in the 40's, yet they still had an adult theme, which was the death of Bambi's mother. Yes, it's tragic, but it teaches children about death. Something they WILL have to learn about eventually, so why not start them off young? You people are making it sound like Disney is showing blood and guts on screen. Not all adult themes fall under that. It's good to have adult themes in children's movies. Such themes get children thinking. They ask questions, and want to learn more. They're good to help them learn more about the world. As for the ""depressing"" part, that helps children learn too. Inside Out did a marvelous job of teaching how it's alright to get upset over something, because sadness is a human emotion we all feel. It also brilliantly displayed how without sadness, we can't have joy. I know some people don't like to see sad moments in children's movies, but they are necessary to help teach the young about the different emotions we feel.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said the film was boring. Well, you can't expect all Disney films to be happy go lucky. This was a more serious film, which as I said before, is good for children to see if done right. If a movie is too serious, then a child will most likely become bored. Inside Out has a good mix of being serious, and having fun. The serious aspects are done beautifully. Particularly the ending. As for the happy moments, they're pleasant to watch. When showing a sad or happy moment, Inside Out shows the emotion with 100% accuracy. I also love how this movie didn't screw with us. When Bing Bong disappeared, I was expecting him to come back at the end, but he didn't. He stayed gone. This is another important lesson to kids. Losing some parts of your childhood is a part of growing up that everyone has to deal with. <br/><br/>As for how I feel about Inside Out, well, you can see that I gave it a perfect score, and in my mind, it deserves a 10/10. It deserves any award it can get. Why? <br/><br/>First of all, the animation is stunning. I love the way the emotions look with their little sparkles surrounding them. Second, the themes the movie shows. Inside Out wasn't afraid to take a more serious approach, and I applaud the people who were involved with this film. They knew they would have a younger audience watching, but included themes that would not only benefit them, but adults as well. Third, the characters were very enjoyable. I was disappointed that we didn't get to see much action from Anger, Disgust, and Fear, but at the same time, I don't see what else they could've offered to the plot. I was fine with traveling with Joy and Sadness throughout the movie, because their contrasting personalities kept me interested. Bing Bong is a perfect symbol for not just imaginary friends, but childhood in general. He represents how bright and innocent children are, but at the same time, also represents the painful fact that our childhoods don't last forever. Forth, and finally, this film did what many don't. Inside Out didn't have a villain. None. That just makes this movie more original, not just plot-wise, but as whole. <br/><br/>I am just so baffled over the sudden wave of negative reviews on this movie recently. Either one person hates this movie with a passion and has created multiple accounts to make multiple reviews, or lots of people are seriously ignorant towards what Disney was trying to do with this film. They obviously can't see past what's on screen, and that's a shame. If only more people these days can see the bigger picture."
"Hitchcoc","7","10","34","19 July 2015"," An Intriguing View of Emotions
","As is often the case, before I could see this film, I had a host of people tell me how it affected them. Tears, creativity, uniquely presented emotions. This always shades the stuff I feel personally. While it didn't speak to me as much as others, I have to admit that it was enjoyable and highly creative. We have as our protagonist, Riley, a little girl who has been fawned on her whole life. She is happy like all kids with a few bumps along the way, as well as typical behavior. We find out that she has been formed by a set of emotions who take on an anthropomorphic being. The five of them create her personality. Unfortunately for her, the family moves from its idyllic setting in Minnesota to San Francisco, where everything is indeed different. During this time, the five emotions become unsettled and this becomes a kind of adventure tale. Joy and Sadness get shot out of their control center, and while they are finding their ways back, Riley begins to fall apart. The strength of this animated film has to do with all aspects of consciousness, such the area of creativity and art where the characters are turned into Picasso figures and later two dimensional figures. There is also the ""Train"" of consciousness, as well as some Freudian stuff to work with. Memories are save on little orbs and are at the center of putting a person back together again. An imaginary friend is brought in as well. This is quite adult at times, showing things that the kids just won't get. Well worth the time to see it. Oh, I know it's been said before. Stop giving movies ones unless they are deserving. Your job is to review, not to vilify things that aren't perfect. A one should be used to evaluate a cheap 1950's horror movie or an exploitation film, not a thoughtful animated feature that has charmed the vast majority of viewers."

","For those people who think this movie is depressing and sad, yea it kinda is but it also brings out the deep meaning of life - sometimes it's okay to cry out and be sad, you don't have to pretend to be happy and positive and keep everything to yourself. I cried so hard when Riley cried and when Joy finally understands how important Sadness is, Inside Out is one of my favourite movies."
"postaldude1013","10","4","10","30 October 2018"," really?
","You poor saps who give this film a 1/10 wouldn't know a good movie if it bit you in the rear!!! Children should be taught to understand their emotions while growing up and I think this movie does an excellent job of doing just that!! I would give ""Inside Out"" 11 stars if I could! Well done, Pixar!"
"edacheeky","10","8","26","2 November 2016"," An emotional roller-coaster
","This film hit home hard. In its exploration of the human mind through a coming of age story, Inside Out explores how our personalities form as we age. This is truly an emotional tale. I was choking back tears all throughout. This film really touched me on a personal level. Each emotion is portrayed as its own entity that has control over the person whose mind they reside in. They each help produce memories associated with each emotion. From this film we learn that each emotion is essential to have and experience and each plays its own significant role. We learn particularly the importance of sadness. Sadness, although an emotion we tend to resent, is a very important emotion. Experiencing pain and sadness is important in growth. When we experience a crisis, our lives turn upside down. But it is during times like these that we experience the most growth. At the end Riley's core memories change and her new memories have mixed instead of single emotions. This expresses Riley's emotional growth. Thus, this coming of age story is one of emotional growth and personality development that we can all relate to. It's something new from Disney and Pixar and I love it."
"daviddevilliers54","8","12","44","4 October 2015"," A totally must see film!
","Yes! Another Pixar masterpiece! At first, i chose not to see it because I thought it would be more of a kid's film. You know, like the ones you feel embarrassed to go to because it attracts rather younger viewers. On my own, I picked the movie and said it was for my younger sister and I watched it. It changed the way I have always felt. No matter how old you are! It is literally an ALL-AGES film! If you want a good film to watch as a family or friends or even alone, I HIGHLY recommend THIS one!!! If you haven't seen it, please do!<br/><br/>*Might contain spoilers ahead so read further at your own risk*<br/><br/>Inside Out is about what happens in our minds. We have little emotions that make who we are. We have lots of memories of the good times, dark times, annoying times, embarrassing times and even lonely times in our lives! In this story, it catches the heart of a joyful emotion called Joy! She is happiness and everything happy. Then we run into other four emotions, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust! Together they all build personality for the girl. It catches exactly what we feel at times. Suddenly, when growing up in a harsh condition such as a new home, new school, etc, our character grows depression and loses all the core memories. Happiness and Sadness are sucked away into the long-term memory halls. Now they have to return to the control center to bring happiness back and return the core memories. There are lots of lessons taught in this, there is comedy and also sadness. For most girls watching this, you can surely relate to the character in this film. <br/><br/>Hope you can see it!"
"hannahivers","4","12","44","27 July 2015"," Disappointing!
","I am a young adult but absolutely love Disney and Pixar movies. I was so excited to see this film but was so disappointed. The trailer was the only funny part sadly.<br/><br/>The sad and joy characters were very irritating and the story line got boring and predictable. There were not a lot of funny parts the best and only part was when you can see in the parents minds. Obviously I understand it is a film for children but it was not fun or a feel good film it was just very irritating and boring and unlike other films in the same category, I would never watch this again. <br/><br/>They could have done so much better with the story line! :("
"Seraphion","6","11","40","23 June 2015"," Too philosophical or technical for kids
","Somehow I don't really think that this movie is really suitable for parents to bring kids to watch. The basic concept is either too technical or too philosophical altogether. The concepts of humans' five basic emotions is well beyond the grasp of an elementary school kid, let alone a toddler. Even though the movie gets to be more and more reasonable as it goes on, still it won't be such a good experience to share about. The animation is nice, it doesn't have overly weird or disproportional drawing styles or camera angles that will further confuse children audiences. And the voice acting is nicely expressive. That should balance the things that this movie lacks."

Pixar's genius is sterling again with the latest instant classic from the studio that keeps making you wish you were a kid again. This time probing the mind of a young girl named Riley (Dia) whose recent move with her family has her emotions under siege with new memories and attempts to retain 'core' ones as well. In charge is Joy (ever peppy Poehler), Sadness (dour Smith), Fear (frantic Hader), Anger (stereotyped Black) and Disgust (Kaling at full tilt) all bucking for control until Joy & Sadness find themselves ousted from headquarters (get it?) and racing to get back to keep things normal in spite of the odds. Funny, warm and poignant and a visual feast for the eyes (great fun spoofing artistry of all types once Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (fun Kind) enters the picture to aid the bickering feelings. Veteran director Pete Docter co-directs with Ronaldo Del Carmen (who penned the lively script with Meg LeFauve & Josh Cooley) with wild abandon. Great for the whole family and one of the year's best films."
"mom-07452","10","12","45","3 March 2016"," I related with Inside Out as if it was my childhood story
","Inside Out is an adorable animated movie about a girl who moves away from her friends, school and relocated to a city where she knew no one. In her brain her memories were stored by little cute emotions. As she started to make memories the balls of light went into different categories. Sadness came upon her and memories were lost. Happiness tried to keep the memories alive but slowly they were disappearing. My favorite part of Inside Out was when her imaginary friend started to fade away, it was such a touching part of the animated film that I cried. As a family of women my mom, me and my 2 nieces we watched the movie together and we have great memories of our own to store and share about the day we spent together and watching Inside Out."
"Genti22","10","12","45","30 December 2015"," One of the best animated movies of all time.
","Inside Out is the newest Pixar movie and also one of their best ever,which clearly means that this movie is something special. This movie is about Riley,an 11 year old girl from Minnesota who loves Hockey and lives happily with her mom and dad.But everything falls apart when they move to San Francisco,where she has to deal with a new house,and new school where she needs to make new friends and her emotions Joy,Sadness,Fear,Anger and Disgust guide her through these life changing events.Though,affected by these changes,Sadness makes a few mistakes that end up with her and Joy,into the far reaches of Riley's mind and with only Fear,Anger and Disgust left to the head quarters to guide Riley and to try and maintain positive thinking. First off to begin with,the emotions and their voice cast in this movie is all around perfect.Starting with Joy,voiced by Amy Poehler,Fear by Bill Hader,Disgust by Mindy Kaling,Anger by Lewis Black and Sadness by Phyllis Smith.They all do a masterful job in here,giving the right voice ""emotion"" to their emotions. Pete Docter is the director of this movie,he previously directed Monsters Inc,which I truly love,and Up,which is my all time favorite animated movie.This guy is a genius at this.He has mastered the art of the animation so well now that everything he does,its perfect. I really liked the way the world inside the mind was presented.I think they found new and interesting ways to show that to us and to impress us.The animation is gorgeous as every other Pixar movie ever,but what makes this movie great,it is the story,that its special and amazing.It is also very funny and will most certainly brings tears of joy (literally) to those who watch it. Kids should see this movie,because they will have fun and marvel at the animation,and laugh at the jokes in it.They will also learn about emotions and about what makes us human as a whole.But quiet frankly,in my opinion this movie is targeted more to adults,because of its thematic and interesting plot and I am pretty sure that adults will get the best of this movie,which is a weird thing to say about an animation,but then again,this is Pixar and you can except anything from these miracle workers. I honestly cried like 3 times in this movie,which is to be expected from this director,after that truly sad and masterpiece of a movie that he made before this,Up,and from what I heard,a lot of people cried also which is an astonishing achievement for the crew. I read an article on how Psychiatrists around the world are really loving this movie,which can clearly tell you just how amazing and well thought Inside Out is.They are saying that kids should definitely see this movie and that it can teach them a lot about emotions which is a hard thematic discussion to have for adults with their children. This is a stunning and original movie,also by far the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3,and in my opinion,in Top 3 of all time Pixar movies.Everyone should watch this movie and I hope that it gets nominated for Best Picture,as Pixar's two earlier movies (Up and Toy Story 3)."

","I should say that this is a really great movie with valuable lessons and fresh plot. <br/><br/>Riley's emotions is relatable to all of us. We all ever experience happiness, sadness, fearfulness, anger, and other emotions in our life, and Pixar delivers a great life lessons in this movie that every emotion and moments in our life is important to helps us grow up as a better person and teach us valuable lessons along the way. This is one of those Pixar and Disney movie that you can always watch it all over again and feels something new each time.<br/><br/>On the other sides, younger child may not understand the concept, so I will recommend it for children older than 7. But overall this is a really fresh movie and both Pixar and Disney deserve an A+."
"toralfs97","9","8","27","18 November 2016"," Great and thoughtful movie!
","To start of this review I would like to get the technical aspects out of the way first. As to be expected, it being a Pixar movie, the animation is fantastic! The characters looks great, has nice details and the movement is smooth. In other words I have nothing to complain about on that side. The same story goes for the sound assets <br/><br/>The movie starts out with a baby girl named Riley being born, and then there is Joy Yeah literally, Joy is there. Inside Out's topic is emotions and it depicts the emotions as characters controlling Riley's brain. The brain quickly gets filled with the other emotions Fear, Anger, Disgust and of course Sadness. You quickly realize that the former and latter is the most central characters in the movie. <br/><br/>One of the first things that struck me was how Pixar interpreted the brain and brought it into a movie. Of course it doesn't look realistic in any shape or fashion, but that's not what's important. What is important however, and what they did a terrific job at, is to make it feel realistic. I got so fascinated by how they built the ""world"", from different islands where special memories get stored, which builds up her personality, and to the Memory dump where memories go to fade away. This and all the bits in between somehow feels authentic. A great example here is a scene in the movie where Riley ""Looses her train of thought"", I just thought it was so clever, and it really made me smile!<br/><br/>That is not the only clever part, far from. While Riley goes through her childhood it's not only fun and games of course, there are events that can be quite dramatic for a young kid. These are events that are common in real life too, and are translated really well into this movie. It even has a scene that I interpreted as a beginning of depression, where the emotions got shut out and Riley didn't feel anything. Of course what happens on screen is not realistic in a literal sense, but if you analyze it you can find quite the deep plot here, which is great!<br/><br/>Considering it being a Disney Pixar movie, you will probably expect it to be rather funny. For Inside Out this is true to some extent, although I will say that the humour is a bit tuned down when compared to other Pixar made movies. This is not a bad thing however! Because of the topic I found it to be just the right balance between jokes and seriousness, which means it's both appealing to kids that don't think too much about the subject, and for adults that may not find the jokes and goofs all that funny. <br/><br/>Watching the movie I had a very pleasant viewing experience. It almost felt like going through my own emotional roller coaster, a bit of joy, a bit of sadness and bits and bobs of things in between. While watching the movie I also got reminded of a lot of old memories, which probably is the main reason I felt so many emotions during the film. I am quite the nostalgic person, resulting in often getting emotional when thinking back on memories that I've had. <br/><br/>As I said earlier Joy and Sadness is basically the main characters in Inside Out. While looking at reviews on IMDb I saw people commenting about this, how the others didn't get enough screen time. While I don't think it would hurt to show Anger and the others a bit more, I think there is good reason that specifically Joy and Sadness is so central in the story. Because when you think about it, what is the emotions you feel the most? For my own part I'm usually happy, I might get worried, angry or disgusted, but in the end I always end up being either sad or glad. If I'm angry it's just for a little while, then I may think about why I actually got angry and end up sad or laughing. Therefore Joy and Sadness is the main characters with good reason.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a movie for all ages, and enjoyable for most people (The 1 star reviews on IMDb is not most people). The animation and sound assets are spot on, the plot is entertaining and surprisingly deep if you think about it. The most impressive aspect is how authentic the interpretation of the brain somehow feels, and how they translate real life events into this movie. In other words it is a great experience and I would absolutely recommend it!"

","why so many people have to rate this movie being a bad one. I loved it, my wife loved it and that result is very rare. The movie doesn't claim to explain the whole world in detail, but it is the first movie in a long time which is made for children that tries it in an interesting way and for me succeeds in a lot of aspects. Finally not a stupid cartoon like, kids are crazy, just be crazy, oh so crazy movie for children and adults. It has a view on how peoples minds might work, it must not be completely correct but it gives you stuff to think about. How many movies where able to provoke that reaction from you in the last time?

","All the negative reviews make me lose faith in mankind a little. It's obvious that people did not understand the (quite simple) plot of the movie, possibly because they are not in touch with their own feelings (not to play Sigmund Freud here, but come on...)<br/><br/>Inside Out, besides visually quite beautiful, is an amazingly educational movie about the importance of feelings in the process of growing up. The main message is that feelings must be embraced and play an important role in personal development.<br/><br/>This movie should be seen by every child (and parent)...<br/><br/>**** Possible spoiler****<br/><br/>... since society is always teaching us (and forcing us) to be happy or look on the bright side of things. While this is true if you don't want to become a negative bore, negative feelings, such as sadness or rage are also part of human nature and should not be repressed. If you do it, you may fall into depression and become unable to feel anything at all. This is very well put in the movie. The growing up process is well portrayed too, by the substitution of the ""islands"" in the little girl's personality.<br/><br/>**** End spoiler***<br/><br/>All in all this is a moving (I cried a little), educational and funny movie, definitely watch it with your kids and discuss it in the end. If by then you have no idea what you just watched, read my spoilers' part."
"magsirover","10","8","27","30 August 2016"," Feels for feels
","Inspiring as it was carefully laid out with amazing story boarding and great choices as a theme. The movie has made a wonderful approach towards explaining the human emotions and the display of change of behavior. Truly educational and a wonderful movie that fits for all viewers for all ages. <br/><br/>If I were to give a few examples of what made this film memorable is the one with Riley's imaginary friend. I loved the idea on how the act of ""sacrifice"" was incorporated into the story and the lesson of taking responsibility for the actions we take as a person. The story generally portrays how although simple were indeed the best times of their lives.<br/><br/>I think that merely writing a review about this story would not really give enough justice for anyone who wishes to understand how surreal this movie can affect the viewer.

"mrgamebox","8","10","36","9 August 2015"," Emotional and intriguing even for adults
","I greatly enjoyed this movie and think it was really well made in terms of content and delivery. Sure, you could say that cartoons like this are childish but the movie was fun and the content made me thinking. I like the idea of personifying emotions that is prominent in this film as it made me think about the human psychology and even my personal way of dealing with the different emotions. Nevertheless, some stereotypes were a bit overused and unnecessary for the enjoyment of the film. I think this film is worth watching for anyone but especially for reflective people or anyone else who is trying to understand their emotions, whatever the age."
"Hellmant","9","10","36","29 June 2015"," It's not a blatant rip-off!
","'INSIDE OUT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Pixar and Disney's new computer-animated fantasy film, about a young girl that's guided through the struggles of moving, and the frequent absence of her father, by her emotions; which are personified, with individual personalities of their own. The movie was directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen and it was written by Docter, Carmen, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley (Docter has co-written and directed other popular Pixar flicks, like 'UP' and 'MONSERS, INC.'; as well as co- wrote 'WALL-E' and 'TOY STORY' 1 & 2). It features the voice talents of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. The concept for the film has been done many times before (most notably on the 90's TV sitcom 'HERMAN'S HEAD') but it's still a very imaginative and well made kids' film!<br/><br/>Riley (Dias) is a young girl, growing up in Minnesota, who has five voices inside her mind; guiding her every decision, and feeling. They're Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black) and Disgust (Kaling). Joy is in charge of keeping Riley primarily happy, but she's constantly struggling with how to deal with Sadness. When Riley is forced to move to San Francisco, at age 11, and her father (MacLachlan) is constantly away at work, things become really challenging for Joy. Especially when Joy and Sadness are thrown out of the headquarters, inside Riley's mind, and have to make a journey back to it, in order to restore Riley's mental stability.<br/><br/>I grew up on 'HERMAN'S HEAD'; I used to watch it all the time when I was a kid, so when I first saw the trailer for this film, I wasn't very impressed. It seemed like a rip-off and it also just didn't look that good to me. So I had low expectation for the movie, until I heard all the rave reviews for it, from critics and audiences alike. After seeing the film, I can say it's not a blatant rip-off; and it does have plenty of fresh ideas and creativity of it's own. Although the premise isn't original, it does deal with it in a interesting and entertaining way; the whole world, inside Riley's mind (the film creates), is very fascinating. I do wonder though, if we all have people inside our heads, guiding us through life, do they all have people inside their heads too, guiding them, and so on? The humor is kind of childish but it does have a very positive message; about dealing with depression, and life struggles, that I think could be beneficial for every kid to see. It might not be one of the most original Pixar films, but it is one of it's best (in my opinion).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/3LSix0bykDQ"

","In this animated film, the mind of an eleven-year old American girl is a universe unto itself. Five characters represent primary emotions occasionally battling for dominance. The world that surrounds them includes a mega-factory like setting that represents long-term memory.<br/><br/>To call ""Inside Out"" clever is a great understatement. It shows the same great creativity and imagination that made the ""Toy Story"" movies such a pleasure to watch. While the girl's outer world has difficult challenges, the inner world (as depicted on screen) is even more chaotic while appearing as an adventure.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in its unusual use of psychology as the device to drive its plot. It even manages to create genuine sadness when some of the girl's early childhood memories disappear. And speaking of psychology, the story has a gentle jab against what could be called ""the tyranny of positive thinking"".<br/><br/>The good humour in this movie adds to its entertainment value while its intelligence shines through as well thanks to a clever story by Pete Docter (the director), Meg LeFauve, and Josh Cooley."

"angelicaripari-10774","10","3","7","30 August 2018"," It was a worthy award
","In Inside out we are introduced to a different idea about growing up, about life experiences, thereby producing a distinct movie. It's an animation which shows us about the routine of one child. It's about the childhood, but not only for kids. Because it reflects on our feelings and changes.
The main one character is Joy. She is the first feeling that Riley had when she was born. Since then, Joy controls the emotions and the memories of Riley. This is the reason of Joy's existence.
After the appearance of Joy, others secondary feelings share the mind of Riley - Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness. All they have their roles by decisions or actions of Riley, but by that time Joy always head the situations.
The journey of the story starts when Riley, that is now 11 years old, moves to another city and her comfortable routine, with her friends, habits, liking, are shattered. These changes have impacted her emotions. So, the characters of her feelings enter in conflict too.
Joy try administering the situation, but she needs to learn how to deal with Sadness, her counterpart.
Produced by Pixel and Disney, this movie won the Oscar of the best animation, and it was a worthy award. It's a singular and original story, dealing into humans emotions, displaying unique sensibility never seen before in a animation. It is a wonderful movie."

","Honestly I loved the movie and my kids loved it as well. I think most of the people who wrote the negative reviews didn't understand the premise or concept. She wasn't depressed, she was sad about moving. There is a definite difference between the two. Her reaction to moving was a very real one. She didn't want to make her parents feel bad about moving so she hid her emotions. That's a very real concept and whether we realize it or not our kids care and worry like we do. And will sometimes not share their feelings for fear of hurting ours. Great movie. Watch it with an open mind."
"kevinlatham","8","3","7","23 April 2018"," Psychoanalysis made accessible to kids
","Okay, I could talk about this movie all day - but for brevity's sake I'll try to use this review to address just two key observations. To begin with, this is the first IMDB review that I've felt compelled to write - and compelled is the appropriate word - as the many poorly formulated critiques of this offering demand a robust rebuttal.<br/><br/>Firstly, in answer to those individuals who feel that this wonderfully imaginative romp was in any way simplistic - sadly they have neither the intellectual sophistication to appreciate the insights it offers to adults nor the bountiful enthusiasm to recognise the wonder it serves up for wee ones. To suggest that this is some sort of half-baked telling in which a bit of a cry rights the world's ills is, in and of itself, an extraordinarily over-simplistic analysis of the narrative. <br/><br/>On the contrary - the whole point of the story is that Riley (by means of her personified emotions) must journey inside herself, consult her dreams and explore the recesses of her subconscious mind in order to learn to embrace her negative emotions - so that she may become a more integrated and well-rounded individual capable of dealing with life's many challenges. This is the crux of psychoanalytic thought - one of the most important and valuable contributions thinkers have made to our collective understanding of the human condition - and this film artfully communicates it in language that children can understand.<br/><br/>Secondly, the notion that this is too sad or depressing for children is actually quite infantile. Kids are not idiots or one-dimensional beings that need to be shielded from the harsh realities of life. In fact, anyone who has a rudimentary understanding of child psychology would know that attempting to achieve this generally results in significant damage to their mental health. There's more than enough accessible comedy contained within this animated masterpiece to keep the tone light and fun - but for the record, the film's that spoke to me most powerfully as a child (namely the animated version of The Lord of the Rings, Watership Down, The Never-ending Story and Return of the Jedi) all contained darkness aplenty.<br/><br/>I'm genuinely concerned for the futures of the children of parents who were unsettled by the tone of this marvellous effort. Please watch it - the somewhat grumbly tone of this review might detract from the glittering gems it has to offer - but trust me, it's hilarious, delightful and ultimately extremely uplifting."

","WOW ! Best movie of PIXAR Disney. I am zapped at some of the critical reviews ! If this is not the best of ones imagination , knock knock.... what is the high of creative thinking then after all ! In the movie classification of a child s emotions broken up into categories is just superb. Home's made in mind for Honesty, Creativity, Dream , Friendship is simply awesome depiction of innocent heart. Attention to detail as usual is yet again wonderful in the movie. The hair color, the girl child s preferences, the french fries land, the train and the glaring golden human brain neurons added perfection to the movie. I love the movie and definitely deserves 10 stars."

","I just saw this movie last night and I immensely enjoyed it. I am not sure if kids would enjoy it as much, since a lot of the dialogue requires some knowledge that might not be for kids. I did not understand why so many of the reviewers said it was a sad movie. I thought that it was an emotional movie, but in no way sad. It is a story about growing up and this, by definition, has bitter sweet moments - that's the point of the movie. It's not a comedy movie and I don't understand why so many people complained that they did not laugh enough. I thought almost all concepts presented were funny, but still I would not say the point of the movie was to get belly laughs. But come on, there are so many nice and subtle fun comments. I totally recommend this movie, if you are the kind that enjoys cartoons and if you are not looking for belly laughs, but for a nice, warm, funny , smart story !"

","One of the finest animated films ever made. It is a drama for 8 or 9 years and older. An exceptional drama. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Inside Out goes into a totally new place for animation. That place in our minds, and how we struggle for inner peace, is displayed in a very special way in this film. I do not think this has ever been done in such a way in a film presented in a form that all can easily understand. While the animation is creative and incredible, this film is not about the animation. The animation is just the way problem is presented.<br/><br/>Like the stage of a play presenting a problem. It is a real life issue about a difficult change in a life that many of us have been through.<br/><br/>I have watched hundreds of animated films, both short and long. This film is different because it deals with real change in real situations. And this is a real person we can identify with, and presentation is unique in its own way. It is not about a princess, or toys, or birds or a time long long ago. It is about an eleven year old who moves from one part of the country to another, and her fears of that move and the resulting normal emotional issues that occur after the move is made. To some, this can be difficult to watch and that is understandable. Some films are difficult to watch. <br/><br/>It is about now, in a drama that is complex as well as difficult. In her head as well as ours. It is a wonderful film about a wonderful person searching for a life in a new place outside her comfort zone. It is the kind of search that many of us go through, and one we all hope to win. Please consider that this search has never been presented in such a special way before. It is a great film about this search. Also, watch this movie and discover a fundamental truth: While the struggle isn't easy, and it is very hard, it is worth the battle."
"borchardt-john","10","11","41","29 June 2015"," Great Movie. No matter what Terastas writes....
","This review is in response to that horribly negative TROLL from Massachusetts which goes by the moniker ""Terastas."" I realize your sad little life hiding behind a computer monitor or smart-phone is all you have in the world, but you should be more supportive of original ideas like ""Inside Out."" First of all, this is a FAMILY movie. Pixar has mastered the art of movie-making that is highly enjoyable for the entire family. I understand you are either still a child or do not have any children, but let me assure you that millions of parents are thankful for Pixar for making films that simultaneously stimulate their children while entertaining their parents on a completely different intellectual level.<br/><br/>Secondly, ""Inside Out"" might not be a completely original concept, but then again neither are talking insects, monsters, toys, or the myriad of other usually inanimate, unintelligent, or mythical beings that movie studios have anthropomorphized for our entertainment.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the characters you so proudly labeled ""one dimensional"" and ""dumbed down"" because they weren't complex feelings or higher levels of thought processing represent the four basic emotions that control human thought. Remember, this is still an animated, FAMILY movie and not an avant-garde art-house film. Would you prefer characters such as ""Sociopath"" or ""Bizarre Fetish Man"" instead of Joy, Fear, Sadness, and Anger? Tarastas, I, too, feel that many of the average American moviegoers are simply sheep. And I'm absolutely sure that movie company executives think the same. If they didn't they wouldn't continue bombarding theaters with the same regurgitated crap that they've been doing for the past 15 or so years. Today, at the theater, while suffering through trailer after horrible trailer waiting on the feature presentation to begin, I noticed nearly every trailer was for a film that has either been ""reimagined"" or from an existing film franchise. The point I am trying to get across is that at least Pixar is still putting out quality movies that are well written as well as visually stunning.<br/><br/>Bottom line: ""Inside Out"" is a great film and an interesting concept with a good message. So call off the dogs, Terastas."

","I really don't want to make any spoilers of any kind, but this is the sort of story where you just have to say some, if you want to say anything. I know it's pretty close to a Japanese story, but this doesn't make it any bad, maybe a clone can be better than the original. Maybe some will think it's overrated, but this movie opened up something in me which was buried for years. I have cried the first time in the last 13 years during this movie, and a whooping 3 times. Clever and deep are just a few things that are going on in this movie, and are just part of what makes it great for the people who've gone through similar feelings in a stage of his/her life. Pleanty of funny lines and nostalgic moments. I would recommend this to anyone, young or old, male or female. It's OK to feel."

","Inside Out(2015) Starring: Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Kaitlyn Dias, Paris Van Dyke, Kyle MacLachlan, Lori Allen, Richard Kind, Diane Lane, Paula Pell, Bobby Moynihan, Paula Poundstone, John Ratzenberger, and Rashida Jones Directed By: Pete Docter Review Meet the little voices inside your head. I have never been a big fan of animated features because their just cartoons and if I want that I'll watch the ones that air on television that I like. But their is this amazing company called Pixar(maybe you've heard of them). They've given me some of my favorite films not just as a child but as I've gotten older. I'm talking Monsters University and of course Toy Story 3. I cried like a baby in Toy Story 3. I haven't cried so hard in a film since, until now when I saw Pixar's latest film Inside Out. The film is about a child named Riley and the little voices inside her head. First comes Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and last but not least Anger. Their Riley's emotions, Joy tries to make sure Riley is happy everyday but Sadness keeps getting in the way. When Riley moves Joy tries to start things out positively in Riley's new home but when Sadness touches another Core memory Joy tries to change it back and they both vanish into long term memory. While they have disappeared Fear, Disgust, and Anger try to make Riley happy on her first day of school and until but they weren't made for those types of feelings. Joy and Sadness have to find a way back to headquarters before Riley runs away from home, her personality destroyed and she can no longer feel anything. I loved the performances from the cast, even the one's who were playing Riley, and her parents. You already know when going into this film that the main stars playing the emotions are going to do an amazing job. Their well known stars in a Pixar movie with a good script. The script isn't very formulaic because it plays with the idea of how we use our emotions. It has a worthwhile point of always doing your best to no mater how feel, you can channel both your sadness with happiness, anger with fear, disgust with happiness or in any way. To makes sure that no matter how we feel we can always be happy no mater what situation, because theirs always way to turn something terrible into something good. While watching the film I was crying because I thought about how I use my emotions in the wrong way when it comes to a girl I like or a girl I like that moves, or not fitting with the people I call my friends at church(because I have nothing in common with them because I love films like it's no one's business, play XBOX One, and I'm going to Fl Supercon, and well I still have acne after trying to get rid of it for five years. This is a film that really touched and can regard as one of the best animated films of all time I'm giving Inside Out a five out of five."
"crazyllamathing","10","12","46","15 June 2015"," Pixar has done it again
","Let me just throw this out there: Inside Out is easily the best Pixar film in years. Inside Out is not just the best in the last few years, but it will without a doubt stand alongside the best of the best the studio has to offer. It's a really tough thing to rank Pixar, because they have had such stellar track record, and so it really boils down to which animated masterpiece is your favorite. Do you love the nostalgia of the original Toy Story, or how about how Finding Nemo swept us away? We can argue The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E and Up are the best that Pixar has to offer...Inside Out is going to further complicate that favorite status for a lot of people.<br/><br/>Inside Out is about a little girl named Riley, and the story takes place during a time when her family makes a great move from her Minnesota home town to San Francisco. For anyone who has ever moved at a young age, they may recall emotional hurdles trying to adjust to living in a new home, new location, a new school and making new friends. It can be a lot to ask for to a child. That is what this movie is about, and Pixar tells this story on parallel planes both from Riley's humanistic world and the very emotions that exist within her head.<br/><br/>Riley's brain is bonkers. Never have I expected to see such surrealistic imaginative settings for a Pixar film. Unlike every film the studio has made to date, Inside Out creates a slate that breaks all logical boundaries. We are talking about a world that is as vast as your very own imagination, and Pixar takes full advantage of that by making truly out-there and brilliant possibilities.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a movie about emotions, and it would not be a success if the movie itself did not feel emotional. This is probably the most emotional Pixar film to date, but as a roller coaster that goes through its highs and lows, and it makes sure you are along for the ride.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, once you see the full picture of Inside Out you will understand the true context and all the metaphors toward life it has to share. This is easily the most complex and layered Pixar film to date, and in a way it sets a new bar for Pixar's maturity at telling captivating stories that anyone can relate to no matter what the age is."

","Inside Out is basically about depression.

This movie is really good and has a lot of good points to make also. The whole movie wonderfully animated with a great cast of characters that are totally three dimensional. Example? Disgust has a sense of fashion and also has a good sense of taste. The voice work is great also, Lewis Black and Bill Hader have standout roles in the movie. <br/><br/>For a movie about emotions, I was on the edge of my seat. The whole movie has islands in her mind crumbling to pieces and you really want Joy and Sadness to get back to headquarters. When Joy falls down into the dump, that really made me gasp. The ending of the movie is totally amazing. I think we can all relate to the ending.<br/><br/>Inside Out is definitely the best animated film of the year so far. It also comes with a great short film also called Lava. Pixar has improved over their last few efforts and I am eager to see The Good Dinosaur this November.<br/><br/>87/100 B+"

","Here's the main difference between me and my 5-year-old son. I mean, clearly, there are many, including the fact that someday soon he'll be able to reach items on the high shelves in the kitchen without a step ladder. But this latest one lies in the way we each reacted to ""Inside Out,"" the new animated epic from Pixar, which takes place mainly within the mind of an 11- year-old girl. Nicolas' favorite part was when the girl's sense of Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) runs around screaming with his butt ablaze, courtesy of a blast of fire from her Anger (Lewis Black). He also liked when Joy (Amy Poehler) was playfully talking to herself. ""Joy is funny,"" the budding film critic added. My favorite part was everything else. The ambition. The intelligence. The complexity. The performances. The poignancy. Director and co-writer Pete Docter's film is as beautiful as it is profound, lively as it is meaningful. This is a movie that dares to explore existential crises, in the middle of the summer, in an animated movie that's aimed at the whole family. And damned if it doesn't pull it off. Like the best Pixar movies — ""Up,"" ""The Incredibles"" and my personal favorite, ""WALL-E"" — it functions quite powerfully on multiple levels at once. And similar to ""Ratatouille,"" in a lot of ways ""Inside Out"" isn't really for kids primarily, even though the figure at its center, Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), is on the brink of adolescence, with all the recognizable angst that accompanies this shift. Children will certainly respond to the movie's spry energy, vibrant colors and clever humor. The script from Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley is one of the more substantive ones yet in a Pixar film — and don't forget, Docter previously directed and co-wrote ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Up"" — but it's also very, very funny, often in a slapsticky way. Er go, the butt on fire. A little bit on the premise, in case this all sounds a tad confusing and abstract. Riley has just moved from Minneapolis to San Francisco with her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan). This would be a difficult transition to make at any time in your childhood, but especially now. Eleven is such an awkward age — such a jumble of extreme emotions — which ""Inside Out"" keenly understands and demonstrates by going inside her brain to show us what she's thinking or feeling at any particular moment. Besides Joy, Anger and Fear, there's Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). When Riley was a little girl, her experiences and memories were all so clear-cut, they were color-coded. The happy ones, like scoring her first hockey goal, remain in the infrastructure of her brain as orbs that glow a bright yellow; the unpleasant ones, like being forced to eat broccoli as an infant, radiate a dark green. And the feelings themselves were reliable in their consistency. Joy always has been perky and resilient and glass-half-full (and Poehler does nimble voice work in playing a character that's the pixellated manifestation of her irresistible demeanor). But lately, the blue and bespectacled Sadness has come to the fore, between the move and all the disconcerting changes occurring both around her and inside her. Reminiscent of Eeyore in the ""Winnie the Pooh"" realm, Sadness is dryly hilarious — so pathetic and so sweet — and so often, the voice of reason. She's the one who's willing to speak the raw truth in an uncomfortable situation. And Smith, with her vulnerable and beautifully nuanced performance, ends up being the movie's unexpected MVP. From here, ""Inside Out"" follows how Riley — and the many sides of her — adapt, or don't. Her journey features many inspired, light moments, from the physical manifestation of a brain freeze while you're enjoying a cold treat to an annoying TV jingle that gets stuck in your head. But it has plenty of dramatic ones, too, including the relationship Riley's emotions have with her long-lost imaginary friend, Bing Bong, voiced heartbreakingly by Richard Kind. (Seriously, ""Inside Out"" rivals ""Toy Story 3″ for the kind of ugly crying it'll provoke in you.) It may meander a tad in the literal labyrinth of Riley's mind as these figures struggle to work together to help her restore her shattered sense of self. But mostly, ""Inside Out"" remains sharp with some really sophisticated notions about the nature of memories — which ones we hold onto, where they sit in the brain, how long we keep them, how they shape our personalities and even how they help us forge relationships. It might sound dull or even didactic, but this being a Pixar film, ""Inside Out"" brings these concepts brilliantly to life. If my son can begin to grasp the idea that happiness and sadness can co-exist within the same moment — but also cackle so hard at a bit of physical comedy that his face turns red and the veins pop out on his neck — then we're onto something truly memorable here."

","I went with high expectations for this film from the feedback it received. I was not disappointed the film is well written and has an interesting perspective of how the mind works. I left the theater thinking of all the different emotions we have and really how they work. The movie is funny and quite sad at some points. Its a feel good family movie that adults can enjoy with their children. The voices go with each character as well as the different moods. Pixar has stepped up their game with this one it is up there with toy story and up. I recommend you see this movie it is fun for children as well as adults. Some of the context is set up for adults to understand. It is not a waste of time to take acouple hours out of the heat and see a fun heartwarming film."
"Robert_duder","8","10","37","7 November 2015"," At this point, can you ever go wrong with Pixar?
","Make one or two or three good movies and people will say ""Oh I love their movies"" or ""Yah I'll give them a shot"" but what about if you've made 15 great movies? What about if the majority of those were solid 10/10's? At this point, I wouldn't believe if Pixar couldn't make a great film so I had every expectation of Inside Out being a home-run and it is! Is it my favourite Pixar film? No, not by a long shot but there are parts of this movie that are stone-cold brilliant and some things about it that make it less than outstanding as some of Pixar's previous films. Still, Inside Out is brilliant when it comes to concept. And its also brilliant for the reason Pixar films are and that is the sheer detail that goes into these films. They don't make their animated films with the demographic of children in mind but rather the demographic of everyone. These are films that anyone can watch and like at an equal level. Still, some of there movies tend to be a touch dark and deal with some very intense emotions (pun intended.) They don't shy away from real life lessons and the reality of life (death, marriage, love etc) Inside Out is no exception. There are some heavy duty lessons here and some definitive dark moments so be wary if showing to the real youngsters.<br/><br/>Amy Poehler is magnificent as Joy. Her character isn't quite as strong as a lead should be but Poehler captures the character well and her voice isn't as recognizable as you'd think. She definitely makes the character come to life. Phyllis Smith might be the true star of the movie as the adorable and heart wrenching sadness. She gets the character arc and the heroic moment and her and Poehler play off each other perfectly. Smith is literally ideal for the role. Richard Kind is great as Riley's childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong. I don't really think they use him enough actually and his story is definitely heart wrenching as well and has some real morals behind it. Bill Hader, Lewis Black (who else could be anger!?) and Mindy Kaling all perform their roles very well. Each one is perfectly suited to their character/emotional counterpart. Kaitlyn Dias is great as Riley and Mom and Dad are perfectly done by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. One of the best things about this cast is outside of a couple of them like Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black who just naturally fit their roles, you don't recognize some of the bigger stars' voices like Poehler, Hader, Lane and MacLachlan. They sink into their characters and that is a compliment.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a completely unique look at the human psyche. The way they turn the brain into a factory like production with these adorable creatures is brilliant. They cover such an insane amount of topics that have to do with memories and emotions that as an adult, it really actually makes you think and really hits home and I think kids will just enjoy the adventure. Pete Doctor (who is a Pixar genius...Toy Story, Monsters' Inc, Wall-E, Up) and Ronnie Del Carmen who might not have the directorial chops but he has worked art direction on several Pixar projects do a really terrific job bringing this world to life. They seamlessly go from the real world to Riley's brain and they even take the time to show some of the other people around her and how their emotions work. Doctor knows how to play to the audience's deep seeded emotions (Up being one of the greatest films ever made period) and he does it again in a slightly lighter way this time around. Inside Out is a must see and while it isn't an instant classic like Up or Wall-E, it still is such a powerfully made, brilliantly visual film with an incredibly unique story that the family can share. 8.5/10"
"AdrenalinDragon","5","10","37","6 August 2015"," It's not THAT good!
","Am I the only one who wasn't blown away by Inside Out? I mean, don't get me wrong. It wasn't bad. Just... alright. Easily one of Pixar's weakest, though. The whole thing felt average and I was wondering if the movie was trying too hard to make people cry. It's hard to explain, but basically it felt more forced than usual.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes were a bit hit and miss for me, and as each character is stuck to one trait pretty much the whole time, the jokes become repetitive. I thought Joy was one of the weakest protagonists we've had from Pixar since Brave, and Riley felt like a robot to me so I never really cared about her, unfortunately.<br/><br/>It's their most gimmicky movie as well. They go through different parts of the brain just to hope people will be visually pleased enough to look past the weak script and characters. Pixar has been a bit shaky the last three times, as anything not a sequel seems to get an undeserved boatload of praise. It was average at best, but seeing people put it as the best Pixar movie, is utterly baffling to me.<br/><br/>6/10"

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This is the most creative and brilliant way I have ever seen emotions visualized. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how they envision a person's mind managing emotions and memories in granular ways. Very cool. The core plot is about the 5 primary emotions of this girl and how they help steer this girl through life as various life events impact her. The big impact was how she is effected and deals with a move from Minnesota to San Francisco and the challenges she faces. As all that happens the personified internal emotions try to maintain control. While much of the story is sad, it is also very touching and honest. There are plenty of comedic moments, energetic moments and adventures. This movie was very well thought out, smart and clever with colorful and vibrant animations."

","I never take the time to write a review of movies or series, but for this one, I gladly make an exception. What I wrote down below is how I personally felt about Inside Out and how it made me feel.<br/><br/>To me, it was the perfect example of a film that slowly but steadily grows on you whilst ensuring character development without becoming too predictable. I especially, as most I am sure, was very annoyed by the presence as well as actions of Sadness in the beginning, yet later on in the film I began to comprehend its importance and right, even essential need to exist for so much more than sorrow, regret and all other less pleasant feelings. <br/><br/>In one of the most beautiful ways I have ever seen, this film shows for me the importance of accepting and acknowledging sadness as an important part of who you are and no matter who you are or what you've been through, Inside Out will always touch base with your feelings one way or the other.<br/><br/>My profound thanks to the people of Pixar and all those who dedicated their time on this amazing capturing of feelings and guidance in the journey of comprehending their significance."
"rannynm","10","11","42","4 November 2015"," We've Got a Masterpiece on Our Hands!
","Ladies and gentlemen, we have a masterpiece on our hands. Pixar has done it again. They already lay claim to two of the top 100 movies of all-time with Up and Wall-E and they have now added Inside Out to their mantelpiece. I will gladly go on record by calling this one of the finest animated features to ever be created. Why? Because it's THE most innovative, imaginative and creative film to be made since 2008s Synecdoche, New York.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about this movie is that both adults and children can enjoy it. As a matter of fact, I'd say that adults may enjoy it more, because they can have a more fundamental understanding of what this film is. It is 100 minutes of analogous brilliance, that changes our idea of what goes on in our heads. Is this idea fathomable or true? No. But the analogy provides the very product film was invented to produce: a stimulation of the imagination. Children will enjoy the beautiful colors and the basic plot. What the children can understand is what they can relate to: growing up and adjusting to life as they enter puberty. They will laugh at things that SEEM funny or the more, for lack of better word, simple pieces of humor. But the true jokes, the pieces of humor that have the most intellect are the ones children won't understand. I appreciate those the most because they're fathomable. It's the moment when you laugh, not because the joke is ridiculous, but because you can actually imagine that happening.<br/><br/>Amidst the hilarity there is also a certain depth of emotion. There is a tear-jerking moment, yes, but I mean more along the lines of nostalgia. The way the movie portrays the effects of the emotions and the rationalization that go along with them, conjure a desire to reflect on oneself in their pre-teen days. This film may literally get into the mind of a pre-teen, but the metaphorical representation is what seals the reflection. ""I was like that?"", ""Is that how I thought then...I that how I think now?"" may be questions you find yourself asking yourself. These are the effects of a brilliant screenplay.<br/><br/>On a final and personal note, I'll tell this short story. There is a scene in the film, where two officers are questioning a cloud in Imagination Land about her dead husband. Then, in the middle of the interrogation the cloud herself is killed as she is run through by our main character. One cop goes, ""Hey wait..."", but as he says that, the other cop grabs him and says, ""Forget it Jake, it's Cloud Town."" Get it? It's a parody of the famous final words from the classic 1974 noir, Chinatown. I'll tell you, it wasn't very comfortable being the only person in the theater laughing at that joke. It's just one joke amongst many. Beyond the hilarity and, mainly due to the aforementioned reasons I explained, I happily give this instant classic 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend it for ages 7 to 18.<br/><br/>This film will be released on DVD/Blu-ray/Digital on November 3 and its bonus features are very informative and engaging. They give wonderful insights to the making of the movie. The feature, Story of the Story really tells you how much thinking went into this story. Mixed Emotions and Mapping the Mind go hand in hand as they provide both characterizations of the emotions and scientific findings pertaining to our emotions. There are also great features about the underrated parts of making this movie, like how the score was created and what the editing was like. My favorite of all of them, is the short film Lava which has become one of my favorite short films.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 16."
"codycadymochi","10","8","28","1 March 2017"," The movie was great! It teaches many important life lessons
","Understanding another person is one of the most difficult tasks a human being experiences. Children, teenagers, and even adults, often gain their knowledge of the world through their surroundings. Since, electronic devices, which display movies and TV shows, are prevalent in today's society, audiences often gravitate to those forms of entertainment and absorb the information. Good movies leave lasting impacts on the minds and hearts of the people who watch the works. In Disney Pixar's Inside Out, the personified emotions that control peoples' feelings, and the core memory spheres are a vital role in a child's understanding of life.<br/><br/>The five emotions stationed in the young girl, Riley's, mind, Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, and Fear, teach people that the way they feel corresponds to the way they act. If everyone could look into another's head, as audiences viewed in Inside Out, understanding the human race would not be a difficult topic. However, that is not the case. Since this movie directly addresses the thoughts in a human's head, even children can understand the emotions better. The color differentiation of each emotion not only draws attention, but also allows people to understand that there are different ways they can feel. Additionally, this movie allows audiences to understand the human nature by personifying the emotions in another person's head. These specific emotions individually and physically control what Riley does, which directly shows that there is a correspondence between the way a person feels to their actions. The way a human feels controls how they act. For example, when a person is sad, they cry, or when they happy they smile. This movie shows that emotion, thoughts, and actions are all connected: emotions control actions, actions control thoughts and thoughts control how the person feel. In addition to these emotions, the core memory spheres show children that as they grow older, they will have a mixture of emotions in their memories, not just one at a time.<br/><br/>Core memories are important to a development of a child, and Inside Out shows audiences that as people mature, their mind changes with them. The main character, Riley, during the movie is a prepubescent ""tween"" who moves to a new city. Throughout the events of the movie, Riley only has simplistic feelings. This is directly shown in the movie when only one control platform, and only one emotion controls her at a time. In the end clips of the movie, the audiences get a glimpse of the emotions inside other characters head, including the the main character's parents. The glimpse presents the ""matured"" minds of her parents, showing all the emotions sitting in a large console where all the emotions can act at together in an organized fashion. Riley's mind, is a mess throughout most of the movie. The events depicted in her mind, show all the emotions cramming together on one small monitor, fighting over who controls her. However, after the events of the movie, Riley's maturing mind beings going through ""puberty"" as the character, Disgust, points out, and shows all the emotions working together in an ""upgraded"" control console. Additionally, all of her core memory orbs are only one specific emotion, joy.<br/><br/>Children must learn that they can not be happy all the time, and in the movie, Inside Out, children can better understand they need to experience all emotions. As shown in the movie, Riley's core memories all gleam gold, representing that all her important memories in her life were happy. Joy, who primarily directs the emotions, leads the group and takes over the control board, not allowing Sadness to participate in anything. As Riley tries to run away, her emotions in the control room, not including Joy and Sadness, try to stop her from leaving. Since Joy and Sadness are lost outside the control room, Disgust tries to lead as Joy does and tells Fear to ""scare"" Riley into staying. However, all the emotions could not get her to feel anything. The lever, telling Riley to react, would not budge. As Joy and Sadness return to the room after their unexpected adventure, the bus Riley is riding begins pulling out. Joy, realizing Sadness is the only emotion that can save Riley, tells Sadness to work the control board. Sadness, hesitantly reaches for the lever and pulls in down. Riley jerks up and runs off the bus, going home. This shows children, that being sadness is an essential emotion, and not a bad. This movie shows that being sad is good, and shows that people are human. As, she enters her house, her parents run and hug her. Riley, starts telling her parents how awful the move was for her and Joy hands Sadness Riley's happy core memories, and they turn blue as they are projected in her mind. Riley begins to cry and smile as her family embraces, and a blue and gold swirled memory orb forms in her head. This specific orb shows, that memories are a mix of emotions. This specific scene shows the sadness Riley feels, mixed with the happy emotions of family. After this specific event, Riley's mind Is shows stronger as ever, with multiples of mixed emotions including fear and disgust. These specific scenes show kids that emotions are not simplistic, that people grow and mature feeling different emotions at the same time.<br/><br/>In the children's movie, Inside Out, people are controlled by five specific emotions, which teach audiences important parts of human life. In modern culture, movies often impact people's minds. Human minds share a connection between, acting, feeling and thinking. Empathy is a feeling not many people experience on a daily basis, but through this movie, it is achievable."
"NovaBrunswick","9","8","28","27 May 2016"," Cute and emotional (no pun intended!)
","Since the beginning, I've been a huge fan of Pixar movies, starting with Toy Story and its three sequels (although funnily enough, I saw Toy Story 2 first, then Toy Story 1 and finally Toy Story 3). Their cute 3D animation style and heartwarming stories always keep me eagerly waiting for the next production, and so I'm always keeping close watch for whatever they'll delight me and my family with next. So when I heard that Pixar was coming up with ""Inside Out"", it surprised me greatly, because this wasn't like anything Pixar had done before. <br/><br/>Riley Henderson is a hockey-crazy 11-year-old girl who one day moves from her childhood Minnesota home to far-off San Francisco, California to start a new life. Her emotions - Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Joy and Fear - try as hard as they can to keep her in order while she deals with the uncertainties that growing up and moving to a new home throws into her path. But one day, the worst happens as Joy and Sadness are accidentally sucked out of Headquarters into the Long-Term Memory bank. With only Anger, Disgust and Fear at the helms, the once-cheerful Riley becomes moody, irritable and lonely, even fighting with her parents and having no friends at her new school to talk to and play with. Joy and Sadness must embark on the long journey back up to Headquarters, along with an unexpected partner in Riley's childhood imaginary friend Bing-Bong, to help get Riley back to her former happy self while also realizing that life isn't always as full of joy as we want it to.<br/><br/>As with any Pixar film, Inside Out manages to pack both some funny moments - the ""Triple-Dent Gum"" advertisement that keeps playing and annoying people, for example - and some sad moments, where a certain somebody ""fades away"" into the oblivion of the Memory Dump. (You've been warned, the tears will come up...) The emotions are cute and colourful, with Joy radiating an ever-bright sunshiny glow.<br/><br/>Since seeing Inside Out, I've been using it as a framework to explain my own emotions using just those five characters from the film. I always like to imagine I have my own ""control centre"", ""Headquarters"", memory banks and orbs and ""Personality Islands"" just like Riley and everybody else does!<br/><br/>There should be a sequel that focuses on how Riley's emotions deal with her hitting her teens and the extreme ups-and-downs that come with adolescence, because the ending left a huge hook for this. Get on to it, Pixar - you know you can do this!<br/><br/>As Joy would say: ""I love it!!"""
"jawneyfloros","10","4","11","19 November 2018"," how depression works
","Review: I loved this movie because it explains how our brains work and what causes depression from a child friendly and understandable perspective. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. Both the casting and acting are incredible also. No one actor took the show this was truly an ensemble performance by all the actors who played the emotions perfectly. The actors that were chosen for each emotion did it perfectly Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Lewis Black as anger and lastly Mindy Kaling as disgust. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."
"siderite","6","9","33","29 September 2015"," Don't believe the hype!
","We know Pixar can do animation. Is the animation in this one good? Yes, it is, I admit it wholeheartedly. The rest is the story, which is boring as hell.<br/><br/>We are used to animations from Pixar that are watchable by the entire family, with enough oomph to make children happy and enough subtle smart to make the adults enjoy the movie. This one is a failure not because children won't enjoy colorful impersonations of base emotions, but because for an adult it all goes from boring to insulting.<br/><br/>There is an enormous hype calling this an intelligent story that talks about the inner emotions of children and people in general. It does, but with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. I dumbfoundedly watched a confused jumble of 1940 psychology colored psychedelically to please infants and high people and that had only one hint towards sexuality and none about actual conflict.<br/><br/>Not only this could have been better in all respects (maybe including animation), but the best parts for me where that they didn't use celebrities for voice actors and the funny credits scenes. The rest was like watching little kid cartoons, you know, the ones that we wouldn't want any child to watch because they look like they're made by psychotic Coca Cola addicts, but they still put them on on every TV post made for kids.<br/><br/>The ""deep"" message of the film, that we don't have to always be happy and that sadness has its purpose and that things are not only black and white (or blue and yellow, whatever) cannot save the utter boredom and pointlessness of the rest of the film. Compared to other Pixar films, this is a disgrace.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I am afraid the only thing I don't feel about this movie is joy. Plenty of anger, disgust and sadness, though."
"kikoydaba3","10","2","4","3 September 2019"," Inside Out is one of those Pixar outputs geared for adults with its deep message about personal growth
","With an innovative story telling, Inside Out is a unique Pixar output that elevates the genre by witty exploration of human psychology. Although the film is about a kid who goes through the commotions of losing home and living in another place, Inside Out is one of those Pixar outputs geared for adults with its deep message about personal growth. Human emotions are not simple happiness, sadness, fear, disgust or anger but a combination of each.<br/><br/>Led by Amy Poehler as Joy, the voice cast perfectly embodies the emotion they represent. Inside Out starts by establishing Riley living in an ideal home. The story takes her from Minnesota to San Francisco, providing an abrupt change of environment. Losing her friends and the place she calls home, Riley's world slowly crumbles as a feeling of loss overcomes her. Despite her best attempts Joy is also overcome by Sadness, played by Phyllis Smith, who unbestknown to them is the emotion Riley needs. As both confront at headquarters an accident occurs that transports them to long term memory, leaving behind Fear, Anger and Disgust, emotions that would only exacerbate Riley.<br/><br/>Their journey back to headquarters takes them through Riley's memories, subconscious, abstract thought, dreams and imagination, presenting a landscape of rapid growth for the character. Simultaneously, pillars or islands of Riley's life fall one by one intensifying the emotion's journey.<br/><br/>An idea by Anger to walk away and return to Minnesota nearly lost the character in her sorrow, when in the last moment Sadness was able to prevent Riley from leaving San Francisco. Returning home she breaks down as all core memories are relived, turning to sad memories instead of happy memories. The ending is cathartic as a new core memory with characteristics of happiness and sadness rebuilds a pillar or island of Riley's family. Inside Out never failed to explore an aspect of the character, doing so comically but in a mature way. The trippy visuals and melodic score are also excellent, balancing the story with appropriate artistic qualities.<br/><br/>Inside Out is easily one of Pixar's finest films and one of the greatest work of animation by default.<br/><br/>10/10"

"lucario_raltz","10","2","4","10 June 2018"," I don't understand the other reviews...
","Hi..., my name is Joy and I'm in the rightful way to answer all of your questions.
Frankly, I don't see the problem with our movie. Even so, it's a family one, but made up for the enjoy of the grown-ups. Maybe you hate it because all of the shouting of Fury, but he can't help it...<br/><br/>Inside Out IT'S NOT the biggest Pixar mistakes, (have you seen the ones that Cars made?) but honestly, it's a movie for reflection and understanding our minds. You have to admit it, trying to explain what's is happening inside your heads isn't an easy task. Totally the opposite. Riley is just a girl that it's trying to live her continuos changes that are occurring in her life. Familie, school, friends, even the first tastes of partnership love; that's something difficult to put on in the big screen. <br/><br/>I don't blame you, maybe you are happy with the movies that have a hero and a villain. That's how Hollywood has been making all of these years. Maybe you feel comfortable with the idea of seeing the end of the plot since the beginning of the movie. With my friends, well, we tried to perform how did Riley's mind work. Of course it's not the brain of an important guy, or a big president, whatever. But, our animators, creatives, and designers work too freaking hard for trying to imagine how does a simple girl brain do work. <br/><br/>You even saw an ally die in this animated movie, come on!, didn't you cry with the tragic death of Riley's imaginary friend?, dudes you really have stone hearts.<br/><br/>I must admit that there are little troubles with the making of the rules of some parts of Riley's brain. But you have to take in mind that human brain is an unexplored field nowadays. But well, I f you don't enjoy our movie, don't be too hard with us. However, you have at least to clap and be amazed with the special effects that we have. The music, the incredible designs of our characters, come on!, they are great!<br/><br/>From more than 50 different emotions, only have to choose 5?!, that's another problem. What you don't have in mind also, is that the movie would at least last 4 or 3 hours with all of those other emotions. In fact, it could be a total cinematographic mess that our directors wouldn't had approved. Sorry guys, but I repeat, understanding human mind is something too hard in this years.<br/><br/>Joy, out!"
"olsson-hannes","10","2","4","26 May 2018"," I don't know exactly why
","This isn't the most epic of Pixar titles. Neither is it the most beautifully animated. The storyline is flawed and some times hard to follow. Logic, there is non - though I believe this was the author's intention to highlight the quirks of the mind. <br/><br/>Yet it is one of the few movies that really move me. For some reason I cry every time I see it. I share the protagonist's experience of moving to a whole new place, changing schools and losing friends. But other movies that tell this story don't move me this way. Some how the author reaches into my deepest nostalgic emotions and pull them out. As soon as I pause the film I stop crying and wonder what the hell I'm doing, only to start again as soon as I return to watch again. <br/><br/>I really can't explain what this movie does so well, but it's touched this heart of stone. And even made me write a review about it. Truly one of those movies where the sums are greater than the parts. I don't think its particularly entertaining, beautiful or mesmerising for children. But way above other animated films, it nails the depth that make all Pixar's films so appealing to adults. (Except Cars. That's a terrible franchise.)"

"zeekwunlau","9","0","0","6 May 2020"," Imaginative movie
","A very imaginative film, with Lele in the brain returning to the brain headquarters, and Riley outside the brain running away from home as the main line, both story lines are very exciting, anthropomorphizing the emotions in the mind and each Functions.<br/><br/>What I like most is the story line in my head, very imaginative. The dream factory shows how dreams are produced, just like making a movie, there is a complete crew. Abstract thinking is also very interesting, vivid Explained what is dimensionality reduction. It seems to be omnipotent in Fantasyland. The final turning point is very interesting. Lele 's favorite core memory (that is, the part where Riley is with his teammates) is actually triggered by worry. Riley didn't hit the most critical ball that day and lost the game, feeling very frustrated and sad, so teammates and parents came to comfort Riley, Lele saw only the second half before. Lele saw, only then Feeling worried is not just a burden, it is also indispensable to Riley.<br/><br/>The 5 emotions (happiness, fear, anger, disgust, anxiety) in the film were proposed by the psychologist consultant Paul Ekman of this film. In fact, he thinks that people's emotions are also surprising, enjoyment, etc., but it is not good in the film Show. I did not find Barbara Fredrickson as a consultant. She believes that people have 18 emotions, the most important thing is love, but this is difficult to anthropomorphize.<br/><br/>The film also shows the positive effect of negative emotions. Finally, Riley, who lost all emotions, can go home, just by worrying. Negative emotions are also useful. For example, when encountering dangerous things, they will be fearful, prompting people to escape from danger; Feeling angry when being violated, being able to attack or demonstrate to others; sadness can make people cope with the loss of important people / things, can also get comfort from others, etc.<br/><br/>However, too much negative emotions can lead to depression, too much positive emotions can cause people to underestimate danger. Negative emotions and positive emotions, the two should reach a balance, Barbara Fredrickson has a metaphor, positive emotions are like a boat For sails, negative emotions are like anchors. For large sails, small anchors can only be rotated in place; for small anchors, large sails can easily turn over."

Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them.<br/><br/>The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection.<br/><br/>I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it.

","It's hard to simplify Inside Out into a few sentences. We follow a girl called Riley and the emotions in her head. Riley moves cross country from Minnesota to San Francisco. This has a mental impact on her and it unleashes havoc in her brain. The emotions have to get their act together before Riley falls into a permanent state of depression and causes irreparable damage to her brain.<br/><br/>Inside Out is fantastic. There are so many fantastic touches added into this movie. I love that the emotions in the mother's head resemble the panel on the View. I love the dream sequence. I love the scene where the mind workers are deleting the memories that Riley doesn't need anymore. It is made with the same thought that was put into Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>The message from the movie is entirely wholesome. I think it's a great message to give children that it is okay to feel more than one way about an event. We can't always be happy and always be angry. Inside Out shows us the issues with this. The only message that this movie proports that I am not so fond of is that the movie seems to say that when you are depressed, you are emotionless. You can be happy and depressed. You can also be angry and depressed. You can also be scared and depressed. Depression is more of a feeling of dejection and despondency, than it is emotionless.<br/><br/>The ending is phenomenal. The scene where Riley enters the home actually made me feel so incredibly sad and happy at the same time. It is truly great cinema. Very impressed at Pixar pulling this off again. It puts itself on a list with Finding Nemo, Up and Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>So why only a 7? While the plot of the real world Riley and the added touches Pixar throws in are great, the story of Joy trying to get back to headquarters is not as good. We fall into a repetition of ""there's only one way back to headquarters"" then ""oh no, that was destroyed, now we can't get back"" then ""there's only one other way back to headquarters"". This repeats about five times. It just got a little one note and, although it didn't become predictable, none of the revelations felt overwhelming.<br/><br/>Overall, very much worth the watch. I cannot wait to rewatch it again. Great for kids and adults alike."

","Inside Out is a film about the loss of one's childhood and happiness. Filtered through a innocent children's film, it limits itself from reaching true potential with this concept, yet it still contains many incredibly real themes. The biggest of which being Joy's arc of allowing sadness to take control. Anyone who is happy 100% of the time is either lying to them self, or a sociopath, and this film acknowledges this a couple times in heartfelt scenes.
The concept and world they built inside of a human brain is very broad and interesting. There is enough within it to where they could easily make a just as emotional sequel, yet I don't think they will end up doing this anytime soon.
Overall this is a very emotional and real film that may or may not make you cry."

The plot is flawless, with every event logically provoking the next one, and every solution to problems having been set up in earlier scenes. The characters are, all of them, endearing. The empathy is built masterfully, and I found myself highly stressed after the islands began to fall. I was worried for Joy and the other guys, but mostly for Riley. She's not the hero of the story by no means, but having her represent and innocent victim of the struggles of the emotions is great and really made, at least me, more engaged in the story and the stakes. These elements made me struggle not to let a tear out at certain points of the movie, like when Bing Bong sacrifices himself or when Riley reunites with her family.

"blackwidowis7cool","10","0","0","2 July 2019"," Pixar's and Disney's very best
","Now this is a Pixar movie! Very different from Pixar's other movies, but an excellent, excellent movie that goes beyond Pixar's usual standard. This film has won quite a few awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature - for a very good reason.
In this movie, instead of having humans as the main characters, the creators of Inside Out made the emotions the main characters. Almost all of the movie takes place inside the main human character's - a girl called Riley - head, with her emotions as characters.
Meet the emotions: Joy - a bubbly, talkative girl and a control freak. She's kinda' likeable, but is my least favourite character. She is in control of the Console, where they get Riley feeling. She tries to keep Sadness away from the console as she doesn't understand Sadness, nor sees the use of her. But she is quite okay with the other emotions - Disgust, Fear, and Anger - being at the console.
Fear - well, the name speaks for itself, doesn't it? Fear is a very nervous guy. A complete scaredy-cat. He is actually quite funny sometimes. He keeps Riley safe and cautious.
Anger - as Joy put it, this dude ""cares very deeply about things being fair."" Prone to 'blowing his top' (almost literally), he is so hilarious and does care and has a lot of soul. He is my personal favourite of the emotions.
Sadness - she is, well, very sad. Joy tries to keep her away from the console as she doesn't understand what she does and believes that Riley should be happy, not sad. Sadness, the rejected one out of the emotions, reads a lot of the Mind Manuals (that tells them how things work in Riley's mind and such). She is full of knowledge of Riley's mind, and actually quite a nice and likeable character.
Disgust - She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned. She controls the disgust aspect of Riley. Again, another likeable and hilarious character and probably the most sensible character - one who deals in realism. Sometimes.
Riley and her parents move to Minnesota. Things come to a head with Joy and Sadness when Sadness starts to touch Riley's memories, causing them to change to sad. On Riley's first day of school after they move, Sadness gets to the Console, causing the memory of that time - which was a very important memory, called a Core Memory - to be sad, and it's the very first one to be sad. Joy panics, and tries to get rid of that Core Memory, and ends up being sucked out of HeadQuarters with Sadness and all the other Core Memories. Now they have to try and get back to HQ as without the Core Memories, Riley starts to lose her personality and slips into depression.
The other emotions try to pretend to be Joy, but that fails miserably. As the other emotions try to navigate Riley through each day as they await Joy's and Sadness' return, Riley becomes distant and aloof, moody and ends up becoming apathetic. Joy learns some very important lessons, the main one being finally understanding Sadness' purpose. Can they make it back to HQ in time to restore Riley?
For a children's movie, this deals with very serious issues. It is very well-thought out and really gets you thinking. I could really relate to Riley. I consider it to be flawless. Absolutely perfect! A great script, great plot, awesome voices, and the issues dealt with are done in such a way that it is still entertaining for children. It is one of my favourite children movies and is an awesome animated movie. The climax is fantastic - it has a very emotional and desperate feel to it. Then again, the whole movie is one big emotional roller-coaster. The cast did a stellar job bringing the characters to life. The music score went very well with the movie.

","""Inside Out"" (2015) is a fantastic movie, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Despite what one might think about movies aimed towards children, this movie is quite deep. Maybe not so much as to a complex narrative, but more so towards an emotional side. It will remind you of sides of yourself you might have forgotten about, and if relating and resonating on that emotional and nostalgic level tends to bring out tears in other circumstances, you're in for another trip down that lane. Be sure to watch it with as comfortable of a surrounding as you can get, as that can allow you to embrace that side and make your watching more rewarding.<br/><br/>That being said, this is also a kid's movie. Despite a surprisingly mature theme, it also features some humor for the younger audience that can come off as distracting depending of your acceptance of quirky characters and slapstick humor. However, Inside Out doesn't stick that side up your face enough in order for it to develop into a nuisance, unless you really dislike those types of elements (but if you do, do re-consider your choice of movie or genre as a whole).<br/><br/>My personal grade: an emotional 8/10.

","Pixar did it again. As we follow Riley, an eleven-year-old girl, we learn how exactly her mind works (a big, industrial machine with the control center manned by Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear), her memories and her personality. But one day, following an accident, Joy and Sadness become expelled from the control center. Thus begins the epic journey as the two emotions attempt to return to where they belong, before Riley suffers too much emotional damage.<br/><br/>Knowing Pixar, we all expect the gorgeous animation and the top-notch voice acting, and of course this film delivers, but it has something more. Out of all of the animated films Pixar has put out, and there are many great ones, ""Inside Out"" has probably the most carefully constructed script of any of them. The dialogue and story are simultaneously both a colorful adventure and an exploration of the thought processes of a young girl. This is probably the greatest film ever about metacognition, yet it is put in terms a child would understand; I left the theater interpreting my thoughts and emotions through the concepts put forth by the animation. Great movie."

","After the two underwhelming sequels(cars 2 and monsters university) pete doctor had a very unique idea for a pixar film and the movie turned out to be called Inside out. One side of the movie is about riley moving to san Francisco and how she has to face her new life. While the other side of the story is about how her five main emotions take care of her; Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear. The main lesson of Inside out is that being sad is ok its part of life and being sad can show how you feel to other people but joy the protagonist really doesn't get what sadness really does. When joy and sadness get transported to long term memory by accident they gotta go threw many obstacles that are in the way like the area longterm memory or the subconscious. Bing bong is the one that lead joy and sadness to all those areas so they can find a way back but every time they try they fail because of what the other emotions are doing in headquarters. Theres one stand alone scene and that is the scene where joy and bing bong fall in to the memory dump. In this scene joy saw the importance of sadness and she learned the lesson that being sad is ok. Joy eventually escape but Bing bong doesn't make it out since he sacrificed himself to help riley, and joy is find anyway to make it back with sadness they eventually do and joy depended on sadness to help riley which she succeeds. Inside out is a very special movie that can really help people especially people with depression. Overall its one of the gems of pixar"

","As the decade rolls to a close I have been thinking about what was the greatest movie of the last 10 years. I remember movies like ""Boyhood"" or ""Whiplash"" or ""Roma"" or ""Social Network"" but in the end I can't stop thinking about INSIDE OUT, the crowning achievement of Pixar (a high bar considering they also made Wall-E). It's a beautiful story in the most simple ways, but tackles ideas that are so complex and intertwined that I'm amazed the filmmakers were able to so perfectly find a balance. It's Pixar's most heartbreaking (Bing-Bong, the climax with Sadness...) and probably their most universally relatable. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking this looked like the next total miss for the company... How wrong I was. This movie is a masterpiece."

","This week I watch the animated comedy adventure Inside Out (2015). Although this film suffers some interesting glaring loopholes, it is a wonderful example of externalizing intangibles. The concept of externalizing intangibles is simply a way of saying that certain non-physical elements are given physical manifestations. In this case, 11-year-old Riley's emotions adopt humanistic characterizations. The logline reads ""After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school."" From a writer's perspective, I have a hard time getting past the idea that if Joy experiences any other emotion than Joy that would indicate that she also has a range of emotions and if so why do we never catch a glimpse of her internal controls? And if that's the case, then is this internal control system an infinite loop? Where does it stop? Once I push these questions to the side, I can appreciate the film for what it was intended to be on a more one-dimensional level. The concept of this film really is a wonderful idea and made for a fun children's story. Being a Pixar film, of course all of the production values are relatively standard for a major studio. I can only imagine how many rounds of edits and reviews were done by multiple artists and directors before the final cut was pushed through. The casting and acting were really well done and I'm not sure we would have had the same film had other actors been chosen for these roles. Overall, I enjoyed the film and would watch it again."

"autisticreviewers","10","11","43","10 November 2015"," Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.
","Disney & Pixar have made some worthy films that have become well known to audiences of all ages, but the last few releases haven't reached to the quality and standards they had established (in which the last great film they had made is both Up and Toy Story 3). With their latest offering, it is safe and proud to say that Inside Out establishes them back in the game of quality storytelling, animation and heart its concept. <br/><br/>Inside Out explores the mind of a young girl, in her mind we are introduced to the emotions of Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear. They have the roles of controlling emotions that they see through Riley's point of view via headquarters, deciding how she reacts to them (for instance; if Riley was to be happy, Joy would have the controls to do so) and as well they collect 'core memories' that store into the long term memory of Riley in which we are throughout the film shown with moments of happiness, love and set her personality. However, when Riley's family makes a big move to the city it changes the roles of the emotions in Riley in which set off an adventure when Joy and Sadness (an emotion that is often pushed aside) are out <br/><br/>What makes this film so well perfect is the mixture of imagination, heart and literally emotion; a concept like this may seem at first impossible to create for the screen but Pixar have come from out and beyond to create an original piece of work that is both open, inspiring and really makes us look in a new way of how our emotions and personal life experiences happen. The animation and use of the right colours for the characters is great and when I mean colour, the emotions themselves have specific colours that represent them as how we understand them. For instance; Joy is yellow, Sadness is blue, Disgust is greens, Fear is purple and Anger of course is red. Each of them has individual personalities that help to establish their roles; Joy is happy, bright and positive that makes Riley seem loved by those around her <br/><br/>The emotion that the film carries throughout is further than what Up had already shown us (the well-known and acclaimed 'Married Life' sequence is beyond to what animated films can do to the heart strings), the film makes us personally understand not only the characters on screen but to personally relate to our own life events and personal experiences. The filmmakers have carefully observed on how emotions drive us, in particular Sadness plays a major role in the story that makes us wonder why we can't be sad throughout life but why it's important to be sad when the time comes. In particular, a key moment towards the end of the film pretty much got me and the whole audience (families, couples and even elderly people) in tears and yet understand in our own personal lives the times we get sad. This is a major point that I deeply thought was brought up perfectly and though the much younger kids may not have got it's point but I think from time to time as they grow up they will get the heart of it. <br/><br/>Emotion aside, there are lighter moments when humour is present and gets the audience to laugh out loud. The character Bing Bong (an imaginative figure of Riley's earlier years) gives this best when he pops up in the plot, but as well Anger, Fear and the emotions in other human characters provide such humour and even discovering moments in our minds. The humour works very well in the film and it helps to keep the audience on a brighter side.<br/><br/>Inside Out is not only a triumphant return to quality storytelling for the filmmakers, but it's both original and engaging for audiences to relate to. Bringing a new way to understand human life and our mind capabilities, the film is perfect for children, adults or even anyone young at heart. This is the best animated film for 2015 and it has a very strong chance in becoming Best Picture in the 2016 Oscars. <br/><br/>5/5 - Nick<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>P.S. The animated short 'Lava' that screens before the feature is amazing and different to the comedic shorts from previous years, having more heart and soul and a positive message about love and happiness told through song and colourful animation in detail."

","Being a Pixar fan, I was waiting for this movie to release but at the same time was not very sure how will they make a movie on feelings. But at the end, I loved watching this movie and in my opinion, it's Pixar's best movie till now. This movie revolves around the feelings of a young girl Riley. The movie showed five personified emotions of Riley- Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust. These emotions controlled Rileys feelings from their headquarters (Riley's Mind) where they create and store memories of Riley. The story of the movie is well written and is very creative.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the birth of Riley and introduces us to the five emotions. The emotions are showed to control thoughts and actions of Riley. As she grows up, she had to shift to a new city with her parents. The emotions try to help her to get through her new life in the new place. But, Sadness and Joy go missing one day and Anger, Disgust and Fear try to take control of the situation until Sadness and Joy return back to the headquarters. <br/><br/>The movie also shows a great perspective to the feelings of different people. For example, when Riley was young, Joy was in main control of Rileys actions, whereas Anger was main controller action of Riley's father and Sadness was the main controller for actions of Riley's mother, Fear controlling actions of cats and many more. One can easily relate these to reality.<br/><br/>The movie is very well directed. The animation is also very good. I would say this is a must watch movie for everyone, from young kids to old people."

","Inside Out is the latest film from acclaimed animation studios Pixar, and features a young girl named Riley, whose mind is controlled by a team of personified emotions. Thsre emotions are Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger. However, when Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, the emotions find themselves unable to cope with the new environment. One thing leads to another, and Joy and Sadness get stranded from the rest of the group, finding themselves in the outskirts of Riley's mind. Will they rejoin the rest of the team in time, or will their girl's emotional deprivation eventually prove self-destructive?<br/><br/>We are all familiar with the glut that Pixar have been through in the past few years. We were all disappointed by Cars 2. We all have our own opinions regarding Brave and Monsters University, but we can all agree that they weren't as effective as, say, Toy Story or Finding Nemo. I am happy to say that this is among the latter tier of Pixar's filmography. Yes, this is a true masterclass in animated storytelling.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a prominent example of the two things I love the most about the studio: their boundless imagination, and their willingness to take on serious issues. The various recesses of Riley's headspace are explored with wit and whimsy, introducing many concepts that haven't been done before in mainstream cinema, if not at all. On top of that, I'm sure many of us have been in a situation similar to our leading girl, where our emotions are stripped away from us as a result of a completely unfamiliar experience.<br/><br/>Kids are going to appreciate the bright colour scheme and the fast-paced slapstick, but adults are going to revel in the more mature humour, as well as the character depth and morality described in the previous paragraph. In fact, I might even go as far as to pitch the words of a few other critics, and suggest that adults will enjoy this more than kids. I mean, I can't imagine little Timmy being too interested in the dynamics between Joy and Sadness.<br/><br/>If there is one thing I have learnt from this film, it's that we all need a bit of sadness in our lives. It helps us reflect on our mistakes, and evaluate what happiness we have already.<br/><br/>Tl;dr see this film, it's really deep and funny charming and stuff."

What goes on inside our heads, dogs' heads, cats' heads/adolescent boys' heads? (hysterical). How do our thought processes evolve and how does our concept of the world around us change as we mature?

"diesel-42899","8","7","24","5 February 2017"," What an insightful movie to help explain emotions!
","What an insightful movie to help explain emotions! Perfect for everyone in the family and an excellent tool to get young people talking about what emotions are and how they feel. Easily relatable, for most viewers. Pixar/Disney artists did a wonderful job with color and animation. The emotions/core memories are solid and primary colored at the beginning of the movie. By the end of the movie the viewer starts to see a mixture of colors in the core memories. Giving the viewer the perspective that one emotion cannot exist without the others. Brilliant explanation with visual concepts! The actor's playing the ""emotions"" – Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), all made their voices come to life on the big screen. The sound effects and Foley artist (Alyson Dee Moore), made the characters come to life and feel real. The primary emotions are: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust. The viewer gets the feeling that the writers of this movie, Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen, have had their share of emotionally charged young people, to have made this writing flow so easily. As a parent, it was easy for many to relate to these emotions from a child's perspective. Elementary for the first few years, as Riley, the main character, could only understand one emotional feeling at a time. Which is exactly how a child can move from one thing to another without major chaotic overtones in their lives. At the age of 11, Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. Life does not go as simply and easily as it had in the past. The emotions she starts to feel or doesn't feel, all start to become overwhelming and Riley gets to be downright empty. Playing in perfectly with the missing emotions, Joy and Sadness. Completely fitting for a preteen and many of the emotional struggles young people have. All of Riley's decisions rest in the hands of Fear, Disgust, and Anger, for a good portion of the movie and they are not only at odds at how to handle the situations, but lost without their leader, Joy. As the movie progresses, Joy and Sadness meet the imaginary friend Riley had as a child, Bing Bong. The three wonder from one memory island to the next, attempting to get back to the Headquarters, AKA, the brain. Bing Bong gives his existence away to save Riley from running away. Which is a great example of how imaginary friends from childhood, seemingly vanish from our minds, the older we become – as if they never existed. Joy and Sadness, come to the rescue, saving Riley from fully following through with running away, and work together, getting Riley to return home and telling her parents how she really feels about the big changes in her life. As the movie comes to the end, the viewer is pulled into the onset of puberty and feeling that Riley is going to be okay with all these changes ahead of her in life. Her emotions are as excited about life, as Riley is about her passion for hockey. A timeless adventure, helping to explain why and how we feel, through the eyes of child."

It can be called an informative yet attractive one. Especially the process of depicting emotions is very beautifully explained.

","This Disney/Pixar film is primarily set in the head of eleven year old Riley Andersen where five emotions; Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger are based. They live in 'Head Quarters' from where they control her temperament and help organise her memories. Overall they are primarily joyful but when her family moves away from her friends in Minnesota to a new home and a new life in San Francisco things start to go wrong. As Riley goes to her new school for the first time Sadness accidentally causes her to cry in front of her new classmates and for the first time a sad core memory is created. Joy tries to stop it being processed and in the process disrupts the other core memories deactivating Riley's 'personality islands'. As Joy struggles with Sadness the two of them and the core memories and removed from Head Quarters; this leaves Disgust, Fear and Anger trying to control Riley's emotions with disastrous results if Joy and Sadness can't get back with the core memories Riley will suffer permanent emotional damage.<br/><br/>I had heard that this film was something very special long before I eventually watched it for me it definitely lived up to the hype. It is rather appropriate that a film about emotions is one of the most emotional I've seen for some time and fittingly, given that Joy and Sadness are the main characters, I shed tears of both joy and sadness before it was over. The creators did a beautiful job anthopomorphising the emotions in a way that created a story that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. The voice actors do a fine job bringing these characters, as well as the human characters, to life. The story is told at a good pace and there are some gentle scares as well as some loss; particularly in an emotional scene of self-sacrifice involving Riley's previously forgotten imaginary friend. While it is sad at times there are just as many joyful moments as well as some good laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film to people of all ages; I've only just watched it but want to watch it again soon."

","This movie is one of Pixar's most overrated.

The only scene that decently brings out emotions from the audience is when the elephant imaginary friend guy sacrifices his life in order for Joy to get back to safety.<br/><br/>-They even reused a punchline made in The Incredibles, ""We're superheroes, what can happen?"" into, ""She's (insert age), what can happen?"" then something happens.<br/><br/><ul><li>The characters aren't even that likable.</li></ul><br/><br/>-I hate how people keep on saying this film grabs the attention of adults as well, when its just filled with stupid jokes after another.

I feel like people would settle with any Pixar film, whether its good or not.<br/><br/>-Overall, I just didn't get the feeling that other Pixar films gave me.

","Finally got to see this movie with the kids a few days ago. A few thoughts: 1) We all have nearly impossible expectations for Pixar films. This one ""seems"" to have lived up to the old standards. There is something for everyone: slapstick action for kids, thoughtful dialog, and mature themes for adults to digest. Finally, tear-jerking moments for those who are affected by the Pixar emotion machine. In other words, this is far above ""Cars"" or ""Cars 2."" 2) It's not a original idea. This is basically animated ""Herman's Head"" which was a fun, little low-budget TV sitcom. 3) The first 30-40 minutes was pretty painful because the movie actually I had two beginnings: first was to introduce the humans, and the second was to introduce the emotions. I was bored. 4) However, the movie really began to ""move"" once Joy and Sadness got on the train for the first time. 5) The animation is awesome as usual. I still see the orbs when I close my eyes."

","It was a normal Saturday. I was rather upbeat and delighted to take the family to see Inside Out. Pixar usually does so well with their movies that I knew this would be another animated favorite. Well I didn't leave the theater as upbeat as I'd gone in. Inside Out was one of the more morose animations I've seen in a long time. I don't think I've been this down watching a Disney animation since Bambi's mother was killed.<br/><br/>The premise of Inside Out was much like the 90's sitcom Herman's Head: emotions are represented in the head of the main character as individual characters. There was Joy, Sadness, Anger, Caution and Disgust. Joy was definitely the dominant character. She monopolized most of the emotional time, which is good, until something went awry. Then Riley, the main character whose head we were looking into, went from joyful to a state of depression and apathy, and not in a funny way. The movie hit a real somber and even dark note and stayed there for some time. Now, we're talking about a Disney movie so of course there was a happy ending but I don't think it was nearly happy enough to overcome the incredibly dampened mood that was cast over the movie. I remember quietly commenting that this girl needs a therapist.<br/><br/>The movie had a good message and put a good spin on the need and meaning of our more negative emotions. Small parts of the movie went off the rails and I think that's because it was taking place inside someone's head. Anything is possible inside someone's mind and how do you graphically represent some of the things in a mind? It was a difficult story Pixar tried to tackle and they did OK."
"jdonalds-5","6","9","34","27 June 2015"," Not for young children
","While very well done, and a favorite subject of mine, I felt Inside Out was very good for adults and perhaps children age 10 and up. The graphics were really good, the depth of the psychology was quite good, but the entire movie was strictly that theme and nothing else.<br/><br/>The meaning of the movie is easily missed by younger children, and there isn't anything to hold their interest. I can't imagine Pixar will make much money selling toys based on this movie.<br/><br/>I took our five year old to the movie. I have six children and this little guy is way ahead of his age for maturity, comprehension, and vocabulary. After the movie I asked him if he enjoyed it and he said yes. I asked if he knew what it was all about and he said no. He then asked me if I knew what it was about. I watched him during the movie and he was squirming, but twice he laid down and it looked like he was going to go to sleep; something he rarely does in the afternoon.<br/><br/>It's sort of odd that this subject is covered in an animated movie which is normally aimed at the young crowd, but it missed on that age group. Then it is a subject adults can really understand, but it's animated which is not normally targeted at adults. Even teens, who could easily understand the content, might not appreciate the animation.<br/><br/>All in all I find this kind of an odd mismatch.<br/><br/>We own the Cars DVD and think that is a wonderful movie for adults and children alike. But I don't imagine buying an Inside Out DVD, or for that matter ever watching it again."

What would a memory bank be depicted and how would the subconscious or dreams look like? The skin of the emotions look like felt, kind of like The Muppets, except they sparkle like some sort of fire. The film gave out a good side-effect which was controlling your emotions. A father took his kid to see the movie and after watching it, he took his son to the pool and he climbed up highest diving board and dived into the pool and his father asked why he did that out of curiosity and he said that fear was driving the bus. Before the feature, there was an introduction by Pete Docter, the film's director, talking about the joy of going to the movies and the short, ""Lava"" about two volcanoes in love. Bottom line: You will laugh, you will cry and you will understand why! So come on and give it a watch it is fun for the whole family. There is no shocking moments like the ones seen on Cartoon Network today. I am positive that you will enjoy it. Bottom line: A must-watch. Rated PG for thematic elements (like references to profanity) and some action (more like some peril, but seriously MPAA raters you are just over-reacting, it should be rated G). This has been another ""Matthew Praises."""
"santiagocosme","5","10","39","14 September 2015"," I'm 38, but too childish to enjoy this adult movie!
","If I had watched this movie when I was 5-10, I would have probably understood none about Inside Out. I get that Pixar movies are getting more and more complicated with new generations getting brighter and cleverer, but I think this pushes the limit too far. Maybe, it's simply intentional. Disney must have realized that a big chunk of their fans are actually adults (I did not see one kid at the cinema for this movie), and the stories are adapted to please them.<br/><br/>Either way, I can only judge for what it made me feel, and honestly, it didn't do much for me. I laughed more at the images in the final credits than I did during the entire movie. Whilst the intention of the movie is absolutely superb, and I gotta give credit to whoever came up with the idea, the actual truth is that I found myself looking at my watch and even thinking of leaving at one stage. Never, ever, have I felt that way with a Pixar movie. I don't get it!! Everyone seems to be raving about this movie, and I just did not care one bit about it. Shame. Maybe I should stick to more childish Disney movies from the good old days."
"tavm","10","10","39","24 June 2015"," Inside Out was another excellent Disney/Pixar animated feature
","Before this feature and the short that preceded it-Lava-director Pete Doctor appeared and explained how his movie-like many others-can take you to new places and inspire various emotions. He was certainly right about that! This film-which centered on the emotions of a girl who feels alienated moving to a new place after years of being comfortable in the old one-can be funny and sad in all the right places. Especially when it focuses on the characters of Joy and Sadness and also an imaginary friend, this movie hits all the right buttons. Very young children may not completely understand all that's depicted but they should still be pretty entertained by many of the images and characterizations depicted here in computer animated form. I really don't want to reveal much so on that note, I highly recommend Inside Out."
"adamrocks-37982","10","10","39","23 June 2015"," The Best Pixar Movie in Yearss
","Director Pete Docter knew what he was doing as he pulled the animation studio away from the pool of mediocrity that has been under a drought for two years.<br/><br/>Released in 2015, this movie started out as a different idea called NEWT. It began work in 2008 and was planned to release the movie in 2012 but was canceled in 2010 as the plot was too similar to RIO. The next year, they gave the scrapped idea to Pete Docter who then thought of a new idea about emotions. These emotions became the movie of Inside Out which is an outright wonderful movie and a sincere apology of how PIXAR was below par over the last few years with the Cars 2 clunker, the sub-par Brave, and the unoriginal Monsters University.<br/><br/>The film has the same thing as UP with the first 10 minutes of growing up and then the rest being adventurous with a heartfelt finish. There are 5 emotions in Riley who guide her through life. Sadness, one of the five emotions wants to control her and ends up knocking every single core memory. Joy catches all the core memories but she and Sadness are accidentally into long-term memory with the core memories. This is the most creative plot that I have ever seen from PIXAR.<br/><br/>This film succeeds in every way possible from its voice acting to its creativity. The idea itself is very creative. It's a way of describing the brain in a unique way. Memory balls, abstract thought, memory dump, and more. It's crazy that they have Dream Productions for movies played for dreams. There is also a console for controlling Riley for what she is doing. I definitely have to give PIXAR credit for having this movie be so creative.<br/><br/>What actually is impressive is that the voice acting for the five emotions themselves are totally in character. Amy Poehler plays as the peppy Joy. Phyllis Smith plays the depressing Sadness. Lewis Black plays the grumpy Anger which is my favorite. Mindy Kaling plays the be clean emotion of Disgust. Finally, Bill Hader plays the easily scared emotion of Fear. There are many great voices in this movie but these emotions really stayed in character. <br/><br/>What's even more impressive is the laughable humor there is. I think it's the funniest PIXAR flick since Ratatouille. There are so many jokes in this movie that even adults will find a good sense of humor. It's an awesome skit with some of the best dialogue made into this movie.<br/><br/>Inside Out isn't just really fun to watch, it's also really smart and truly heartfelt as the movie continues on. I sniffed over on this more as Riley's personality disappeared. It reminds people of how tough life at times can certainly be. Like UP, you will have to bring your tissues.<br/><br/>I don't really have to explain the animation. It's the same with PIXAR's previous 14 flicks. Bright, colorful, vivid, exuberant, and eye popping. There is a flaw in the movie but it's very minimal. The 3D was useless since it added no depth, but the flaws are easily swamped by how amazing this movie really is.<br/><br/>Inside Out is the best PIXAR movie in years. It's currently my favorite movie this summer and one of my favorite films this year. It's glorious, humorous, and highly emotional. Plus, stay for the end credits. They are really funny in other people's emotions inside. Call PIXAR back on track and have it win best animated movie of the year in the 2016 Oscars. ""A (3D)"" ""A+ (2D)"" <br/><br/>Notes: Before the film, there is a heartwarming short film called Lava. It's about how two volcanoes fall in love. It was sweet, charming, and cute. The 3D version does NOTHING to make the things pop out or to even enhance the feature except darker colors and a full dimension. See it in 2D if you can. This is one of the two PIXAR movies that will be released in 2015. The other PIXAR movie released in the same year is The Good Dinosaur. It shouldn't be missed by any person that's 7 and up. It's recommended for ages 4—6 but beware of this highly emotional film that will make you cry which makes it an iffy choice. However, if you are 3 and under, it's safe to just skip it. I noticed this because I saw one toddler walking out of the theater with his parent. I think he feels very sad with this movie."
"mitchell_coughlin","9","10","39","20 June 2015"," An Exciting Return to Early Pixar Glory
","After a few years of enjoyable but mediocre films and questionable sequels, I was beginning to give up on the early Pixar that revolutionised film in so many ways. Inside Out is the closest Pixar has achieved to their early greatness for a long time and, in my opinion, it is a true triumph.<br/><br/>Inside Out mainly takes place inside the brain but the movie is filled with nothing but heart. Directors Docter and Del Carmen manage to create a world filled with lovable and complex characters that you can't help rooting for. Riley's journey throughout the film is a universal struggle that creates a sense of nostalgia that can at times be overwhelming. Similarly, Joy (brought to life by the never disappointing Amy Poehler) is perfectly portrayed and impossible not to love, support, and cry with throughout the film.<br/><br/>However the film is can be as funny as it is heart wrenching. I saw Inside Out at a late night session and despite there being not a single child in the cinema, I missed many lines in the film that couldn't be heard over the laughter from the line before. Pixar has once again found the perfect balance between child and adult humour and themes that is reminiscent of earlier triumphs such as Finding Nemo and The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a movie that I have found extremely hard to fault. My only regret coming out of the film was that I wish I could have explored the colourful, unique and imaginative world created in the film for much longer than the refined runtime allowed.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a fondness for nostalgia. No need to find a kid to take to this one, Inside Out is an instant and unashamed classic for all ages."
"jonathanpinzon","10","6","20","14 June 2017"," One of Pixar best films!
","Inside Out is consider to be a landmark in not only in the animation industry but in the 21st Century cinema. Earning an Oscar for Best Animated Film proves so much that Pixar is here to stay no matter what and still make a beautiful film time after time. Everything about the film is done perfectly and the movie's message is one of the strongest Pixar has done since Toy Story 3 in 2010. People, do me a huge favor and don't listen to those people on IMDb that talk badly about this epic masterpiece, they are a bunch of liars and just want attention and want to ruin Pixar's skills of creativity. Inside Out is one of Pixar best films they have ever done. Go watch it and simply enjoy it."
"lexmisaila","9","7","25","9 February 2017"," Excellent movie
","I consider it to be an important movie to watch growing up - it had helped my little sister overcome her mental problems (as much as she could) and improve her relationships with other. She says this movie has inspired her.<br/><br/>The moment Riley considered (and did so) leaving her parents is based on true facts; I am surrounded by children around her age and I see that this is how they behave when they meet the same situation as our character did in the movie. I find it extremely concerning, since children nowadays are a lot more easily bothered by unfortunate life events and see things differently from how we used to when we were their age. I think that Inside Out is a very good warning for both parents and kids. We learn how Riley was misunderstood by her parents (due to lack of communication) and how it lead to her decision of running away. Thus, it ends with a lesson learned by the characters and the viewers.<br/><br/>The story line is exciting, suitable for people of all ages, amusing, with what seem to be simple characters who own bigger back stories. I recommend watching Inside Out if you're happy, bored, or going through a rough time. I simply recommend seeing it, in case you haven't already!<br/><br/>Rated 9/10 because I personally think it was predictable, however I didn't manage to find any other problems."
"Jeinaz","8","7","25","4 February 2017"," A very good movie understanding a teenagers life and feelings
","I was excited once i was going to watch this, seeing the trailers and thinking it was just a funny animated movie. Once i watched it, it made me think. About how we can be so eaten up by our feelings and emotions that we forget our family and loved ones, how much they wan't to be there for us and help us in any time of life. Sometimes we just wan't to get away, but that's not always the best choice. I really loved watching this film, it's a good learner and reminder of how a teenagers life can be and is. Bullying, embarrassment, breakdowns and not always getting what you wish for but still having a hint about what you currently got. I recommend this movie for pretty much anyone, especially for people that got kids and are in the same situation and need a reminder what really matters in life even tho it might not be the best time for you and your family right now."

A special mention should go to the casting. Amy Poehler is the queen of playing optimistic characters and she's proved it yet again with this time.

"purple_whisper-84232","9","7","25","20 May 2016"," You wouldn't want to miss this movie.
","This is one of my favorite movies ever. I was 19 when I watched it and I felt like it was the sort of materials I would expose my kids to. I am sorry for having to spoil the plot for you but it is just fascinating how by the end, they linked memories to sadness, and it is sadness that saved the girl. And i believe they wanted to say more by that. We all look at sadness as a bad thing, as an unwanted thing and true, being sad messes things up (just like in the movie) but sometimes being sad is just to find balance, and it isn't that bad thing. I liked when the old imaginary friend of the little girl sacrificed himself to help joy and sadness find their way, I found that very beautiful and expressing. Sometimes things from our past need to send us free so that we can move forward but that doesn't mean that those thongs weren't real, at least, to us. I also found the way Joy treated Sadness beautiful to discuss. Joy tried her best to be nice to sadness, but only when sadness is watching. Joy was, clearly, faking it around sadness for she thought that sadness doesn't know how to have fun which is very true but that is only because that's who sadness is and people should be accepted for who they are. I want to say more about what this movie made me realize but then i'll probably say too much so i'll just thank Pixar and Disney for this amazing work and recommend you to watch this piece of beautiful moving small cute characters."
"jcanceko","10","14","61","5 June 2015"," Watch your emotions become emotional...
","This film is a wonder: it is a visual feast, its story is multi-layered yet focused and relatable, and it brings so many ideas that truly work best in the art form (not genre!) of animation. It has become my personal favorite film from Pete Doctor, and it is easily the best film from Pixar since Toy Story 3 or Up.<br/><br/>Inside Out hits all the marks: strong creative visuals, interesting characters, an enthralling story and a level of depth and understanding of human emotion that really brings a lot of your own personal connections and thoughts onto the surface. After viewing the film I couldn't stop thinking how effective and educational the story is about understanding how we all operate day-to-day, dealing with each moment and event and how our emotions influence our actions. The film has a number of qualities, for instance, it works just as well as a coming- of-age film, as it does an adventure film, and in a sense, a team or workplace film with the office setting being inside the mind.<br/><br/>It makes complete sense that the project comes from and is led by Pete Doctor (with the help of co-director— and my favorite Pixar story artist— Ronnie del Carmen). He is able to breathe new life into Pixar with these new characters, bringing the studio back on track, and pushing it in new ways of storytelling. He handles the strong emotional aspects that film depict so well, such as joy (literally, the character Joy!), sentimentality, drama, and so on with the utmost care. Pete and his team are able to inject a great sense of honesty and purity into the film, which you begin as an outsider viewer, and you then become a participant and connect with the story with each beat.<br/><br/>After our SIFF screening— during the Q&A with Peter Doctor and producer Jonas Rivera— Pete talks a bit of how this film truly utilizes the strengths and advantages of animation for telling a story like this. I completely agree as watching the film, I just kept thinking of other ways this story and its emotional connections can be done. (And with respect to ""Herman's Head"", which I did watch and love as a kid!) I realized that true emotions are raw, and they are just expressionistic to its core. We all have our own interpretations of our own emotions — as well as others— and it's a challenge trying to visually represent all that universally.<br/><br/>Animation uses caricature, exaggerated movement, and specific pacing and shot design in unique ways that allows for ideas like Inside Out to work so well. While we're given the visuals, the sound, and the story, animation is still able to provide a bit of leeway that other film art forms cannot. Animation allows the audience to interact with the story in a unique way: with imagination. Seeing a caricature and the visual design of an element in the film allows us to make our own connections, and that creates a better understanding of what that element is and what it represents (example: Joy's character design and her poses mimic a bright shining star, and these techniques carry-on to the other emotion characters). And it's because of qualities like this that helps us connect to the characters and the events on-screen so well— to the point that our own feelings start to peek through and we create that emotional bridge."
"cliff-97858","5","8","30","15 February 2016"," Great premise, but lacking charm
","I am really torn about this motion picture. I found it to be a very creative premise, and a grand opportunity to showcase the inner workings of the human mind in a very whimsical & imaginative way.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned elsewhere, It is beautifully animated, and the voice actors do their jobs Commendably. <br/><br/>Something went amiss, though, because the final Product is lacking in many regards. What disappointed Me, was a noticeable absence of that hallmark, Disney humour, It was comical, and occasionally even frenetic in spots, but there were long stretches of near monotony and despair, not entirely befitting of most Family entertainment.<br/><br/>I can't, for the life of me, ascertain who this movie is intended for. It feels a bit Long-winded, a touch confusing and overly complex for younger audiences, and yet a tad too simplistic for most Grown-up Tastes. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate ""Inside out"", in fact, it had some, very cute and lovely moments, but on the whole, just Wasn't quite up to Disney Pixar's, usually top-notch standards."
"cleargraphics","8","9","35","9 November 2015"," This addition is one of Pixar's better achievements, in my opinion.
","Inside Out is a story where all the emotions of a person are individuals inside a person's brain with a command and control center and the story gets clever and insightful with that theme, especially in dealing with memories of the past. <br/><br/>If you liked Toy Story, Bug's Life, Monster's Inc. and Finding Nemo, you might find that InSide Out is going back to Pixar's roots of stories that have a heart and sole. After a few years of Pixar wondering into superficial movies like Cars, Cars 2, Planes, and Planes 2, Inside Out is refreshing. Amy Poehler, from SNL, re-wrote the entire script for Pixar and voiced a principal role in this cartoon. <br/><br/>The movie is good for people that are already into Pixar films. If you are not into computer animated theatrical films, this movie might not be special enough to grab you. I, myself, am a Pixar animation connoisseur and this addition was one of Pixar's better achievements, in my opinion."

I believe every parent should see this, solely to understand your child a bit more, and those without children can watch this and relate as well. There is something to relate to here for everyone.

We especially loved the character of Bing Bong, the long lost, imaginary friend. He played such a crucial role in bringing Joy and Sadness back to headquarters! The whole idea that a change in circumstance can change the outcome of a memory really made me think about my own experiences as a child.

"RileyOnFilm","10","9","36","29 June 2015"," Cool Trailer Cooler Movie
","There are movies that need no introduction because you can tell from the trailer they are cool. Inside Out was cool out of the gate. Judging my the packed in house on a Monday night when I took my family to see it, people agree it's cool. There's something about a simple concept brought to the screen or television with a gang of hella talented people that wins the crowd every time. I compare it to Seinfeld that way. It has a simple premise: a little girl's mind going through the challenges of school and moving. Her mind is where the characters are and they produce some hilarious if not downright profound discussion material.<br/><br/>Without giving any of its delights away, I will tell you there are two platforms the movie switches back and forth from: the little girl's mind and the real world she's in. It heartwarming, suspenseful, enlightening, and entertaining the way they portray her emotions. We get her from the inside-out: emotions first, real world second. It's an excellent movie for kids because it opens up conversations on fear and anxiety, which as we know children feel from both small and big events in their lives. It's also quite fitting as a date movie or if you're just out with a friend. I always like movies that shine a light on the human condition and don't preach. These sort of movies allow the viewer to pour themselves into the questions and draw their own conclusions. In this case those experiences will be childhood and adulthood."

But it had an amazing moral plot and hilarious jokes without having to be disgusting or perverted. It's incredibly deep and thoughtful and relates to real life. To be honest, I'm not sure younger children understand how important this movie is as older ones do. It's still cute and enjoyable for all. It's just both of my young cousins, 9 and 12, didn't cry or anything but my brother, two aunts, and myself cried quite often. Certain parts are a bit slow and cliché but totally worth it and necessary."
"Derektyler-858-928978","10","9","36","28 June 2015"," Finally the Pixar movie we deserved
","I have never written a review before, but something inside(out) of me feels like it needs to. The last good Pixar movie(in my opinion) came out in 2010 with Toy Story 3. Not saying that Brave or Monsters University aren't good. They are just not Pixar classics in my eyes. Unlike Inside Out which is an instant Pixar classic that stands up there with the greats. Inside Out is filled with emotion, creativity, and memorable characters that you can only find in the best of Pixar's films. I even got a little teary eyed and several parts of the film. The last time that happened it was during the beginning sequence of Up. So do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I 100% guarantee that you will not be disappointed."
"gugigor","10","9","36","22 June 2015"," Amazing movie!
","This movie was outstanding. First off, let's just say that this movie is very unique. Featuring all the feelings was very creative of Pixar, and the crux of the whole film. Next, because they featured the emotions within Riley's mind, the development was unusually heavy and deep. You know why they brag that this movie is made by the guys who made up? Because the Up guys really put their hearts into it. That 10 minute relationship between Carl and his wife? Here, it's turned into a full-feature child-parents relationship, but also with Riley and her relationship with the new area she moves to. <br/><br/>Of course, uniqueness and development are only the tip of the ice berg. The movie is tension-filled, leaving me on my edge of my seat, tearing my hair out, yelling: ""Nooooo! NOOOOOOOO!!!"" (Especially near the climax scene where the emotions narrowly don't make it!) The fact that it's realistic and the lands Joy and Sadness travel to fall down one-by-one, showing that Riley is losing her core self and losing who she truly is--becoming a robot, becoming out of touch with her emotions--oh dang; that's truly suspenseful and horrifying! And shall I mention (BIG spoiler--You are warned here and now--BIG spoiler)-- Bing Bong sacrifices himself in order to make Riley happy--but it's not just about Joy. No; it's not about Joy leading onwards, optimistic no matter what. It shows that people have duality of emotions. It's realistic- - and the multitude of emotions, instead of simply one emotion (or no emotion at all in the case of the movie's crucial pinpoint), there are a load of emotions within the movie.<br/><br/>Obviously, this movie is not just deep and touching. Let us end this review on a lighter note--this movie has excellent comedy as well. The main comical subject is the aforementioned Bing Bong 9in my opinion), which makes his death ever so-more heart-wrenching. But other than that, the humor is quite intelligent. The helicopter guy, Angry's flame, goofball land, they all add a good amount of laughs and heart-warming moments to this film. So in conclusion, this movie is amazing. It's one of pixar's best, if not the best-- failing only second arguably to the Toy Story series. (And even that is arguable). If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. It has made it into the top ten of my best movies ever watched. :D"
"valen060","10","9","36","18 June 2015"," Truly Comes From the Heart
","Owing from Pixar Studios' absence last year - and it's recent over-reliance on prequels and sequels - their latest project titled Inside Out happens to be the most hilarious and emotionally-driven movie ever shown. Not since their last films Up and Toy Story 3 has there ever been a Pixar movie that will make you laugh and even move you by the time it has reached its climactic end.<br/><br/>As the story goes, 11-year-old Riley Anderson and her family live a great life in their Minnesota town. But when her father is transferred to a new job in the Bay Area of San Francisco and has the entire family uprooted, Riley has trouble fitting in to this different environment, causing her emotions within to navigate her through a new neighborhood, new school, and new life.<br/><br/>When it was near over, I began to take notice there were a few various fellow audience members (fewer kids and mostly adults) quietly tearing up, while it also left the gears in my mind constantly turning and pondering out of curiosity over how much the studio went through to get this concept right. To me, I feel Pixar seems to have finally rebounded from their quality blunders in the early 2010s and focused more on an entirely new, original story that has an equal balance of comedy and drama rather than just one particular genre, which doesn't usually turn out that well when trying to tell it in animated form. With a talented cast voicing the personified emotions like Amy Poehler and Bill Hader (SNL alums), Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, and Phyllis Smith, it's like they really channeled these vibrant, colorful characters with such ease and likability. Newcomer Kaitlyn Dias wasn't bad neither voicing their human host Riley since the character's personality - from my own personal experience - started to remind me of a young niece I know. Director Pete Docter sure cranked out yet another cleverly crafted, amazing story following from his past, touching hits Monsters Inc. and Up. And he certainly meant well when he said that his movies were practically based on his family life, in this case his own preteen daughter Ellie - whom Riley is loosely modeled after.<br/><br/>The film's concept feels near-similar to past works like 2001's Osmosis Jones (its concept was well-conceived, but how it contrasts into the real world setting didn't translate well) and the 1943 Disney short titled ""Reason and Emotion."" However the studio managed to push this concept further with an imaginative set-up where the emotions are not just the characters, but by exploring that the mind has endless possibilities and realms for them to wander outside their headquarters, depending on how well Riley's experiences (good or bad) are in the real world. It's like it frequently plays with Isaac Newton's third law of motion. One example of that had Sadness affecting one core memory by touch and it affects Riley not just physically, but mentally as well. Psychologically for an adult, we would easily get the idea if the problem isn't resolved, apathy will further escalate. Not many kids will understand why we feel moved by it, since through their perspective, they'll mostly adore the entire film as a visual and spectacle delight. With that aside, this movie never once disappointed me since it has both ambition and Pixar nostalgia written all over it. I'm also glad that since the emotions' human host is female, the writing crew did not rely on giving Riley stereotypical ""girly"" interests. Giving her a tomboy-like trait properly balances out how she can run on both sides.<br/><br/>The moral: No matter your age or the life you live, the importance of family and your own well-being shouldn't be overlooked. Your mind says one thing, but from the heart there's something more.<br/><br/>On a separate note: Its accompanying short subject titled Lava is definitely worth looking into.

"Argemaluco","8","8","31","22 June 2015"," Inside Out
","Inside Out gradually introduces us into the complexities of human mind in an accessible way, so therefore, this ambitious ride through the turbulent emotions of pre-adolescence is likable and very entertaining, without losing a considerable emotional resonance I hadn't seen in a Pixar film since Toy Story 2. And I'm not talking about an easy emotional manipulation, but an authentic comprehension of the mood swings we all experience in moments of crisis and transition. What the hell does all that mean? It doesn't matter; it's better to watch the film. Not all the concepts harmonically integrate themselves into the vertiginous narrative; there are some arbitrary moments which exploit the diffuse logic of the story, and the ending feels like a convenient ""deus ex machina"". However, Inside Out has many pros to offer, such as the excellent voice work from the whole cast, specially Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader, Louis Black and Phyllis Smith. And we also have the many voices which bring weight, humor or sensibility to the supporting or incidental roles, making them equally relevant and funny (Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Richard Kind, Paula Poundstone, Bobby Moynihan, Paula Pell, Flea, Rashida Jones, John Ratzenberger and the great Frank Oz). Besides, we have the extraordinary images created by the Pixar artists, with characters full of expressiveness, settings of a magical design, casual realism and the accustomed details which make us smile or think when we least expected it (by the way, don't forget to stay during the end credits to understand the difference between cats and dogs). In conclusion, I wouldn't consider it an excellent movie, but I think Inside Out marks Pixar's return to original thought, the solid combination of animation, story and imagination, and the dramatic zeal which characterized its best films, before they became a factory of sequels and toy commercials to satisfy the ambition of its corporative father. Sure, there seem to be many second, third and even fourth parts in the list of Pixar's future projects, but as long as they keep that seed of creativity which generates innovative movies such as Inside Out, things will be on the right track. I think this film doesn't only represent the girl Riley's ""coming of age"", but also Pixar's itself; after a difficult period of adjustment, life is extended to a future full of possibilities. I wonder what is waiting for them in the adolescence..."
"condillon","Null","8","31","19 June 2015"," Pixar Has Done It Once Again!
","Inside Out follows a young girl named Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwestern lifestyle and moves to the busy and chaotic San Francisco, her emotions; Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and (her most important emotion) Joy, start to disagree on how to deal with this dramatic change, which causes problems up in Headquarters, the central living and working place for the five emotions. Well Pixar, you have surfaced once again, another redeeming animation that qualifies a original story that most certainly works well in the end. Peter Docter, who brought us Up & Monsters Inc., once again does a applause worthy venture into another expedition of Pixar. He labored so effectively into the mind of a 11-year-old so well that the character panders off so accurately to any adult or young adult. When there's a Pixar film, there's always tremendous beauty of animation that will have you in awe, Inside Out most definitely crushed that aspect by delivering such a immense stature. No animated film in such a long time I have had a chance to witness, has never had such vast emotion to it that you can't help but set off a state of compassion and feel for that will make you stuck to that theater seat the whole 94 minutes of runtime. I will admit, I did get a bit teary eyed at a lot of scenes because what Docter put into such a film is that life can't always be the way you want it to turn out to be but to just enjoy what you have for right now and keep the best of memories under lock and key so you know what life is all about. The cleverness put in is so nimble and unique that it strikes a thought asking ""where does Hollywood find the brightest of people?"", they did the immense pleasure of putting a idea and making it into something so imaginative that it works so honestly for a animated film. Overall, Inside Out is one diverse arc with a remarkable cast that not just only targets kids but for adults as well, the satire given was mostly aimed at adults more than at the kiddies because it's the kind of humor that is mostly hinted at a higher state which fits perfectly for them & children. Inside Out brings great pride to beings that makes us who we are!"
"seymoremovies-44089","8","8","31","19 June 2015"," INSIDE OUT - Seymore Movies Review
","Fresh from a year off (just like Pixar) Seymore Movies has returned with a brand spanking new movie review, and in this post we take a look at the new animation Inside Out.<br/><br/>Now I want to get it off my chest straight from the top, that I am a big fan of Pixar movies – however I was a little hesitant leading to the release of this movie as (to be fair) I was not entirely sure what this movie was all about. I a big fan of movie trailers, and I can spend hours watching them, however I didn't see the complete trailers for Inside Out so I went into the movie with wide open optimism (which I recommend).<br/><br/>The movie revolves around 11 year old Riley (played by relative newcomer Kaitlyn Dias), and her 5 emotions Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) – and you can rest easy Pixar legend John ""Cliff"" Ratzenburger continues his recurring role in their movies voicing the role of Fritz.<br/><br/>Throughout Riley's life her memories have been happy ones, as her ""control center"" has always been operated by the emotion Joy. Riley thrives on key memories such as friendship, family and hockey, however her life is thrown into turmoil when her family up sticks and move her across the country leaving all her friends and home comforts behind. Things take a crazier turn when the emotions Joy and Sadness are sucked out of Riley's control center into the vast world of Riley's brain, leaving her control room to be operated by the less favorable Fear, Disgust and Anger. Joy and Sadness then have to find their way back to HQ Riley in order to restore order – easier said than done.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, it was a different take on what Pixar has done in the past, and credit must go to the writing and directing team for an excellent movie experience. My only concern is for the younger viewers, I believe the movie can be enjoyed for all ages however the true message of the story is likely to be lost with the younger kids.<br/><br/>On a side note, I was treated to another enjoyable Pixar short before the movie – this time in the shape of a romantic love song animation called Lava.<br/><br/>http://www.seymoremovies.wordpress.com"

It gives a graphic, amusing, serious and interesting account of an 11 year old girl uprooted from an idyllic life to the harsh realities of the inner city, and how five of her key emotions help her to adapt - even when things go wrong. From a psychological viewpoint, the film researched the subject with input from professionals in their fields, and this is demonstrated throughout the story. The only thing missing was a soundtrack. Disney could have included the brilliance of good music / songs, which would have made a Inside Out an Oscar winner on every front."

This movie has an extremely important theme.. It delves into our deepest emotions. And the way we look at the world growing up. We deal with loneliness, frustration, anger, jealousy, and it's the transition from child to adult.. it's not easy to leave behind the things we loved as kids and now we need to all of the sudden be grown up and deal with constant change around us..We are very vulnerable in this period.. 
and I feel like this movie beautifully illustrates some of the frustrations inside our minds.. of curse it's made with beautiful animation and it's just a take on how It could look inside our minds. Made to a child's enjoyment. And for myself as well. I'm 21 years old and I LOVED this movie.. it spoke to my inner child. And I got really moved by this film.. I even shed a tear towards the end..
Definitely one of the best Pixar movies for sure! Two big thumbs up! Keep em coming Pixar!"

","03/19/2018<br/><br/>Movie Review of ""Inside Out""<br/><br/>Fear, Sadness, Disgust, Joy and Anger! All emotions we all deal with everyday. The theme of this film was to truly depict what goes on in a child's mind from a toddler to a teenager. Each emotion held their own unique personalities and explained in way children could understand. Starting with the vibrant colors of each emotion. It was clear to distinguish who is who and who's at the operation panel to pan out a day in the mind of Riley. The vibrant colors and tone in the characters voices throughout the film also made it easy to depict what was really going on.<br/><br/>Riley's family is forced to move, and Riley has a difficult time adjusting. I love the dinner table scene where Riley is upset and has an attitude when Joy and Sadness are stuck at the other islands tying to get back to HQ. all of this while the ""fun"" islands are slowing fading away. In this scene it depicts a real-life scene where a mother and father want to understand what's going on with their daughter and Riley just wasn't having it. Each emotion from Mom, Dad and Riley were at play here and although it was meant as a serious scene it was depicted comically. The writers wanted to show something the audience can relate to and that is captured here for sure!<br/><br/>This film was unique, and I believe that's what was so loved about it. It was a ""real"" kids movie that both adults and children could relate to."

","Such a wonderful movie, very funny, exciting and affecting. The movie portrays a young girls emotions as competing creatures in her head, and it's wonderful how much it all makes sense. It's apparent that the movie took the premise very seriously and wanted to get it right - this is no Herman's Head (not that I have any problem with Herman's Head).<br/><br/>The movie does a beautiful job both in its simple framing story of a girl dealing with the disruption of her life and in the tale of her inner emotions and how they relate and sometimes misunderstand one another. This is of the standard of the best of Pixar, along with Up and Wall-E. <br/><br/>A number of people have posted that this movie is more for adults than kids - my girlfriend said the same thing - but I'm not sure if that's true. While it has a sophisticated view of emotion, it's not one that's hard to understand. The characters are relatable and the movie is fast and fun. And kids aren't quite as obtuse as people think. I don't have any kids though, so I'm just guessing that they might like it after all. Having had a traumatic move at age 6, I certainly would have related."

"jvic52","9","8","32","19 June 2015"," Another great Pixar classic
","I'm a moviegoer who loves seeing original ideas and original screenplay when watching films. For the past couple years it seems that Hollywood has lost much of its originality and is recycling the same tired movies, or morphing repeated novels into film. This is where Disney Pixar has gone above and beyond the rest. They continue to capture audiences around the world with every film they produce. The originality that lies within the studio goes unmatched by almost all. Pete Docter (director) has a wonderful imagination and an even better talent at transforming his imagination to the big screen.<br/><br/>About the movie: Cast: The characters are both memorable and easy to relate to. These emotions stir up in every one of us and it is very funny to look at human emotions through the eyes of Docter. The voices are a perfect match for each emotion as well. No one went too over the top and no one lagged behind the rest. Each character blended well into the film and made their mark in their own individual way. Even the films main characters, Riley and her family, were very easy to relate too. Growing up is hard and emotions (especially in young girls) can fly around like crazy. I feel that this is an aspect of the film many people can relate to, the hardships of growing up. <br/><br/>Plot: I will do my best to not give the movie away. It is an interesting story that I am still digesting as I write this review. I saw a pre-screening last night and have been thinking about the movie ever since. All of Riley's core emotions (joy, sadness, disgust, anger, and fear) all live in pretty much the control center of Riley's brain. They each help Riley form memories that shape her view on life and help her discover who she is as a person. For a reason I won't share with you, joy and sadness get separated from the control center and end up in Riley's long term memory space. They get separated at a really crucial point in Riley's life, her family moves from Minnesota to California which is a really hard move for Riley, without Joy (her once main emotion) controlling things Riley turns into a completely different person. Although Joy and Sadness are not present in the control center they can most certainly tell something is not right with their girl. The adventure to get back to help Riley is full of the two emotions that got lost in the first place, joy and sadness. <br/><br/>It is interesting that Pixar has these two emotions working together. I say this because I feel that these emotions are the secret of the studios success with all of their films. These are the two strongest emotions inside all of us, joy and sadness, and in each of their films they have an equal blend of both of these emotions that really capture the heart of the audience. As I think back to almost all the Pixar films I've seen they both had extremely sad parts that would most certainly bring tears to your eyes (Up, Toy Story films, Wall-E, Brave, etc) and equally funny, heartwarming parts that make us fall in love with the films. All I can say is, thank you Pixar for staying original and yet again capturing the hearts of all of those who dare to dream and still have a little imagination left inside of us."

","For the past few years, the Oscars for the best animation went to some undeserving ones like frozen, mainly for want of better movies. It is with that apprehension that i watched Inside out. I am glad i took the leap of faith.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the movie. Especially the way it dealt with tender emotions of a child reconciling to a major change in life. I must say that it is not just about a child, but about adults also. I will not be able to say if the psychological processes shown in the movie are absolutely correct, but they are very relatable. Most of the figurative used in the movie are to a large extent relatable: the imaginary friend and the its resigned oblivion; memories getting recycled when not being used and memories enriching aspects of a personality.<br/><br/>As with every children's movie, there is some preachiness. But i guess that much can be tolerated as it is compensated with a profound idea.<br/><br/>There are funny parts as well in the movie but not very common.

"ThiefJuice","10","9","38","12 November 2015"," Sadness and Joy, the trademark of Pixar personified!
","This movie was incredible! I understand why people are giving bad reviews, this movie is definitely not for everyone - Opinions will always differ.<br/><br/>Pixar is known for their heart-warming, bittersweet movies, and this was no disappointment! I've been waiting to see this movie since they announced it, and I must say, I was very pleased! <br/><br/>Of course, many people aren't happy because not everyone will enjoy absolutely everything, and there is no such thing as a perfect movie, totally fine. Inside Out was definitely a movie I loved! The CGI was beautiful (as expected) and the story had it's clichés (problem leads to adventure with many obstacles) but it was still really unique. Not 100% Original of course, but that's to be expected. The basic concept of the problem and adventure is used over and over, but its not the concept I enjoy, it's what they did with it, and what they did in Inside Out was nothing short of brilliant!<br/><br/>From here on out, there will be Spoilers, and you have been warned:<br/><br/>Riley is young, innocent, happy, and living it up in a little town in Minnesota when she gets whisked away thousands of miles to the big city: San Francisco. She left her friends, her team, her home. This causes emotional turmoil inside of her, and being young, she lashes out. She has to learn to let her true feelings out rather than bottling them up, out of fear for the consequences. Pixar found a clever, fun way to make this an adventure inside her mind. This isn't dark, it's real. Life isn't always happy (Big shock) and kids need to know that.<br/><br/>What they also need to know is that they're going to feel sadness. In the beginning of the movie, sadness is pushed aside and basically told she's not the right emotion, she doesn't belong there. How many times have we been told that ""Attitude changes everything""? ""Happiness is a choice""? We're constantly being bombarded with the idea that anything other than happy is wrong. Through Inside Out, Pixar has boldly stated that it's not! We need all of our emotions - sadness, anger, disgust, fear and joy, and the rest which were not exactly shown. All of our emotions are real and it's okay to feel them. Joy learned that Sadness was an important part of Riley too, and that she couldn't always be in complete control - she had to let Riley be something other than happy sometimes. <br/><br/>Of course, there are other emotions we can feel, oh so many, many emotions - If Pixar had included all of them, the movie would have had hours and hours of introductions, and nobody wants to sit through that, unless they're working on some kind of Psychology dissertation, and even then they would be falling asleep. Pixar chose a few of the more prominent emotions and created personifications of them - So yes, the characters look like what they personify - That's kind of the point.<br/><br/>I've heard that Inside Out is terrible because it shows that depression is easily gotten over with a hug and a good cry. Of course that's not true, depression is a lifelong disorder that eats away at you, and it's terrible. Pixar did NOT mean that it is easily gotten over. Depression (according to my college psychology textbook) is a disorder categorized by extreme hopelessness, gloom, etc. that lingers consistently for longer than 6 months. Riley did NOT have depression. Riley was SAD, for a grand total of what, 2-3 days? Not depression. Depression cannot be fixed easily (or at all, it just gets treated). Sadness on the other hand, can be cheered up, reconciled, and yes, fixed. Riley went through a bad experience: She left her home and friends behind - It's a rough transition, especially when you're young that made her incredibly sad. She let that emotion out, and she was able to deal with it once she accepted it, and her family helped. That's how sadness works. There is a monumental difference between being sad, and having depression. <br/><br/>The message of Inside Out seems to have been unclear to some negative reviewers: It's not that growing up is full of negativity and ultimately sucks, it's that life is full of different emotions, and nothing in life is perfect - things don't always go your way. Yeah, sometimes life sucks, but you've got to find a way to push through, and if your emotions are weighing you down, you've got to let them out (in a healthy way). Sometimes you're going to be overwhelmingly sad, and things will look bleak and all you want to do is run away. It happens, and it's okay to feel that way. What matters is what you do about it. Sometimes you're going to need people, and you're going to have to let them in, and guess what? That's totally okay! <br/><br/>That's The message Inside Out gave, and it's beautiful and true, and if you don't want your kids to know that because you want to protect them, save this movie until they're mature enough to handle the truth. Honestly, I think you should let your kids watch this movie, and help them understand - Feelings are natural, and happiness is NOT a choice. It's okay to be sad, and need people. Everyone needs to learn to deal with their emotions - not push them aside and lash out. <br/><br/>I honestly think this movie is enjoyable for all ages. If you're someone who can't handle something that has childhood innocence, life lessons and very little adult content, then you probably shouldn't watch Inside Out. I myself am a fan of all kinds of movies. Inside Out is definitely one of my absolute favorite Pixar movies to date, and all I have left to say is this:<br/><br/>Well done, Pixar, Exceedingly Well Done."

","This is the best animation movie that I've ever seen. Though it does not use too many visual effects as previous animation movies often do, but it does spend a lot of efforts on the plot. It not only brings back the audience to the old good times,but also makes people to think again about the importance and function of all kinds of emotions When one is in a dark time, the first thing to disappear is happiness, Then as time passes, the sadness will be hidden as well, and hate, anger and anxiety are what will be left in the end. This is the most common emotional circle for modem people. We can realize that every emotion has its own function. And it is a very important topic for us to learn that what role does an emotion play in our lives."
"BillSims28","9","8","33","20 August 2015"," Five Word Review: Creative, Beautiful, Witty, Emotional Odyssey
","The spectacular 15th feature from Pixar's impressive (minus Cars 2) filmography that started with 1995's Toy Story, Inside Out deals with the turbulent emotions of a pre-pubescent Minnesota girl whose family uproots and moves to the big city. With five base emotions represented, the casting is basically perfect. It's hard to imagine anyone other than Parks and Recreation's enthusiastic Amy Poehler as Joy, or Sadness and Disgust being represented by people other than Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling (The Office US,) and Lewis Black was destined to play Anger in a film. Bill Hader as Fear is something of an indifferent choice, yet works well regardless.<br/><br/>The Pixar film longest in production and it shows, Inside Out might be the greatest film ever made by Pixar. And considering the competition includes the Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, Up and Ratatouille, that is a definite accomplishment. I don't want to say much; too much detail would only spoil a film that can be described as nothing but genius. A film for, well, people with emotions, Inside Out is sure to affect anyone who watches it if they've ever felt emotion, because everyone can connect with it so well. Inside Out succeeds on the 3 core aspects that make a Pixar film a Pixar film - specifically the EWA factor. This comprises of Emotion, (the emotional connection, with top scorers being Up and Toy Story 3) Wit (the humour and laughs of a feature, high in all but especially Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo) and Awe (which takes into account the visual quality of the animation, the creativity and the world created in the film. The best ones for Awe are the original Toy Story, Wall- E and Ratatouille.) It just shows how good Inside Out is that it's a top scorer for all three categories. So funny in parts - mostly the Chinatown reference, the Lego Movie-style gags that occur in the imagination centre of the brain and the credits - yet also heart-breaking throughout, and so, so creative and imaginative, both in concept and execution. It has that unique Pixar ability to be hilarious, jaw-dropping and tear-jerking all in a minute. <br/><br/>I really don't want to say this, but the only bad thing about Inside Out is the limitation given to it by its U certificate, which results in a few too many juvenile slapstick gags at the expense of Fear. Also, it would have been fantastic to see a 15-rated version of this with the protagonist going through puberty. But these are minor complaints in what is an almost flawless display of limitless imagination, razor-sharp script, note-perfect voice performances and the most pathos in any Pixar films apart from Toy Story 3 (which only had so much due to its reliance on nostalgia.) Easily the best film so far in 2015, Inside Out is a must-see film, an epic odyssey of a young girl's life and quite possibly the most emotional film ever. 94/100."

She moves from being a child with simple emotional responses toward the more adolescent and adult world of complex emotions where life's situations are a mix of joy and sadness, and old memories can take on different meanings through the lens of experience.<br/><br/>The journey through the brain is a fantastic voyage, showing not only triumph and wonder, but real sense of loss as memories of childhood fade. The film is not one of those relentless happy, one dimensional stories where the tensions are not real. It is very much like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in that the story is simple and has a happy ending, but has many dark moments. That is what makes the film great, and I suppose why it's not to everyone's taste. But I will say that my warm and intelligent 11 year old daughter loved it, and connected to it. And so did my wife and I."
"agmoldham","8","8","33","16 August 2015"," Another gem by Pixar
","Although not without the occasional disappointment, Pixar have been behind many of the best movies of the last 20 years. Inside Out can certainly be added to the long list of great Pixar movies.<br/><br/>The plot goes on inside the head of Riley who is a happy child enjoying life in the Midwest. The characters who control Riley are Joy, Fear, Sadness, Anger and Disgust. These characters fight for control and the outside world sees the result of this through Riley's emotions and behaviour.<br/><br/>The great thing about Pixar movies is that they are always character driven. Unlike so many movies you really care about the characters. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie and good to report that there are a few extras in the closing credit sequence."
"lasttimeisaw","9","7","28","9 August 2015"," my Pixar island will never be thrown into the memory dump
","Pixar's latest offer is an absolutely worthwhile adventure for adults and teenagers alike (certainly not for toddlers), makes further efforts to forever change the existential territory of animation feature, it is our generation's great blessing to have Pixar continuously giving life to such master-class animations, which defy the temptation of huge profits from low- hanging fruits, as DESPICABLE ME series and its spin-off THE MINIONS (2015) unblushingly cashes in on.<br/><br/>Anthropomorphising our emotions into five singular entities, Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Disgust (Kaling), Fear (Hader) and Anger (Black), which reign over every single individual's daily life (not just humans, critters like cats and dogs have them too), might sound a bit dumbed-down on paper, clearly we all aware that we have much more important emotions other than this major five (which is my only hiccup with the setting, especially for adults, more emotions need to be discovered as we grow up, such as pride, shame, jealousy, honesty, guilty etc.), but five is sufficient enough for our protagonist Riley (Dias), a 11-year- old girl whose main emotion is Joy, but now she is experiencing a difficult time when her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is only a hindsight, the film itself is bursting with whimsical and eye-opening pizazz and it magically constructs a visual and logical splendour of how our brain is working, from the headquarter where 5 emotions work, to the personality islands which created by core memories, to a long term memory labyrinth where memory balls are stalled and constantly cleansed with a train of thoughts doing all the transportation in-between. Then the more innovative cerebral designs, such as the abstract thought zone, where three- dimensional figure reduces to one-dimensional and bespeaks the immaturity and instability of Riley's young brain (a great visual deviation); the dream production, imitates a hectic film crew to re-enact the daily happenings with farcical verisimilitude for Riley's dreamland; in the subconscious world lies our worst nightmares, for Riley, it could be a walking broccoli or a giant clown and finally, the memory dump, where everything will vanish from Riley's memory forever, also a poignant moment occurs as we say goodbye to Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (Kind), whose is hoping for reconnect with Riley, but in reality, they only descend to oblivion when we grow up. <br/><br/>All the ingenuity is convincingly relatable for everyone, and tailor-made with what Riley undergoes in her life, who loses her important personality islands one by one, after Joy and Sadness incidentally are sucked out of the headquarter through the transporting tube when Joy is busy at keeping the blue Sadness at bay from the ""happy"" memory balls. The remaining trio emotions make a great mess while Joy is intent on getting back until she realises she may not be the key emotion to implement the overhaul and save Riley from her impractical running-away plan. The two parallel worlds are perfectly meshed together, the cause-and-effect interactions are brilliantly carried out thanks to a rigorous script sprinkled with grade A humour and sincere emotional projection. And the centre message it inculcates is extremely edifying, we should embrace all the emotions, especially do not underestimate the power of sadness, through sadness, one can face the true feelings and that's what makes us a qualified human being. <br/><br/>I watched the picture in its 3D format, and it is preceded by a 7-minutes short LAVA, directed by James Ford Murphy, a charming love story about two lonely volcanoes with inspiring artistry. One must give kudos to the team headed by Peter Doctor, the mastermind behind MONSTERS, INC. (2001, 8/10) and UP (2009, 9/10). And as long as I live, I promise, my Pixar island will never be thrown into the memory dump, INSIDE OUT is my current best film of 2015 and if any this year's upcoming films can excel it, 2015 will be a great year of cinema in my book!"

","Possibly the deepest Pixar film I've ever seen. It's message is important and can be applied to every person from all walks of life. I viewed it as a mental health metaphor. Sadness is depression, fear is anxiety, happiness and anger are the two that form bipolar and disgust is the little things that can send people off. It is a really good film and not just for kids. <br/><br/>Perfect in every way. Maybe if it wasn't as focused for children, the film could have dug further into the mental health side of things and made it more adult like. But realistically, this film has an important message that everybody should learn."

","I watched this moving not realizing what I was getting into. It explores the mind and emotions of a little girl and gives a great perspective into how the mind works. I found myself entertained and available the entire movie. The interesting part is that if you read about depression or anxiety, this movie has some similarities in how things are described.<br/><br/>I find it interesting how the different emotions communicated and think that its a great way to have a young person understand emotions. My son watched this movie at the age of 7 and used it as an example several times when attempting to explain his thoughts.<br/><br/>From start to finish, I think this movie did a great job of displaying how to controls ones emotions as well as how we all think differently.<br/><br/>The scene with the parents emotional icons showing was classic and a great example of differentiating how men and women think differently."

"afortiorama","9","8","34","11 October 2015"," Really good
","I had quite high expectations on this movie as I found the trailers intriguing. I have to say it didn't disappoint. Pixar went into a lot of details to represent the evolution of a human mind.<br/><br/>I like the way emotions evolve during Riley's life. We start with a console with one big button and only two emotions Joy and Sadness, then all the basic emotions appear (Fear, Disgust and Anger) and the console becomes more complicated, but the memory have all one single color - because that's how children and teenager see the world the equivalent of black and white but with colors - and the emotions don't work together and all look at Joy as the leader, without really knowing what they are supposed to express, until she gets lost with Sadness, whom she despised and think of as an hindrance rather than a useful emotion. Sadness doesn't know herself what she is doing, because tendentially sadness is a passive emotion and allows others to bully her, but she is also the emotion that allows to slow down and think - after all she is the only one who reads the manuals in the control room. I have to admit I love the Sadness character and find her really funny when she gets Joy drag her around the memories maze. As I find constant Joy a bit irritating until she understands the importance of Sadness. :) It is only through the journey to go back to the control room that Joy and Sadness start to know each other and really start to cooperate as a team which will produce eventually memories of mixed colours. By the end of the film we have a team, with a bigger complicated console that allow to produce secondary emotions and mixed colors memories. I actually like also the fact that her emotions are a mix of her parents emotions.<br/><br/>The idea of the islands of personality connected to core memories which start to crumble when the core memories get lost, is a really good idea and I loved the abstraction factory. :) The film is not a ride of Joy, it is a mixture of emotions from the beginning when Joy dominates, through the journey of Sadness and Joy that results in rebellious and depressed Riley to finally the admission of Sadness as a fully fledged emotion and a cathartic family hug that produces the first mixed color memory.<br/><br/>It is a film that probably requires more than one view to get in all the details.<br/><br/>The only real criticism for me is that I Anger, Disgust and Fear are under developed characters and they remain a bit clichéd caricatures."
"TheMadWolf","10","8","34","17 July 2015"," Touching and Creative
","This is the most creative movie to date from Pixar. I would say the best, but that is up to interpretation as all Pixar movies try to strike the emotional cord as much as possible. From that perspective it differs from person to person.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is simple: young girl trying to coupe with the reality shift of moving to a new place. The way it is portrayed, from ""Inside Out"" is really nice. Each character has 5 emotions that dictate how that person is at any given time through a console :D. Also there is one specific dominant trait that has control more of the time. In this case Happiness and Sadness - the first two emotions the main characters first felt in her life - are lost in long term memory, leaving Fear, Anger and Disgust at the controls :D. What could go wrong ?!?!<br/><br/>All in all the movie is visually a spectacle, story delivery very good, acting the same, with maybe graphics lagging a bit behind.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Quinoa1984","10","8","34","25 June 2015"," Joy and Sadness
","Inside Out is one of the most daring films for children - and for adults as well - that I can think of from Hollywood, in the sense that it tells the audience ""look, not only can you be sad sometimes, you NEED to be sad"". That may be the ultimate takeaway, but it permeates a lot of the conflict of the film; there's no real key 'villain' here, and like Pixar's previous film, Monsters University, there's no really clear antagonist ala the robot in WALL-E or Jason Lee in the Incredibles. <br/><br/>The stakes are all about 'what is this person going to choose to do, to be, to have the growth and change of human experience?' And with kids too, it's a fascinating idea to explore in the depth this does. Many times as children, we're told to not be so sad, to pick up our spirits and be happy, or be happier, to not cry, to not be angry, and some children even get punished if they, say, cry too much or throw temper tantrums - if they're not ""normal"" in the sense of having constant joy. Look at Winnie the Pooh to see the many different takes on outlooks, such as Tigger being boundless energy, Pooh being curiosity, Piglet fear, Rabbit the 'brains', with Eeyore being the one who is constantly sad, and almost made to seem like kind of a punch-line, the ""Nobody's here but me"" deal.<br/><br/>If that sounds a little deep to take your four year old too, don't worry: this is one of the company's most entertaining and, often, funny films. It builds exponentially on the segment from Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, where we saw inside the mind of a man while on a date/during sex. Of course this is a PG kid's movie so it can't go there (It's an 11 year old-girl after all), but the filmmakers give us five 'emotions' with Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, who all control little Riley as she goes about her life. When her family moves to San Francisco, and a mishap occurs in the control room - Joy and Sadness get taken away and, in maybe the one real Pixar trope (Toy Stories and Nemo come to mind), they got to get back to where they need to be.<br/><br/>Growing up and experiencing new things is what Inside Out is about, and getting there is the ultimate conflict. And while it appeals to kids who may be going through this (or will), and for adults who can tap into what Riley goes through, it doesn't stop for jokes involving the different places inside the consciousness sphere: sub-consciousness, 'Dream-Land' (the movie studio, with the dream filter over the camera lens for filming), Imagination-Land, and (my personal favorite) Abstract Thought, where beings turn step by step into shapes and colors.<br/><br/>This latter one shows off just how endlessly clever Pixar can be, by making doodles and figures one might see in a painting right before us. And even the Emotion characters themselves keep making the studio work wonders: look at how the hair and fibers on these things comes off and has the depth of detail one always look for in the films from these guys. By now the company could be resting on their laurels solely - and there are some more (unnecessary?) sequels to come. But Inside Out poses another challenge for them, to make all of these different 'lands' and environments, the max of the Memory Balls, the ""Train of Thought"", everything that shows everything was given consideration and metric-tons of creative wit.<br/><br/>There's many laughs to be had following along with Joy and Sadness as they try to find their way back, and this is balanced out by the very real, painful things that a child goes through, especially at the age of 11. It's difficult to make an authentic movie in live-action, but in animation it just comes off like a miracle of some kind; all of the peril means something, and a seemingly goofy side character, like Bing-Bong the imaginary friend to Riley, is fully realized as anyone else in the film. Watch when Riley's objects in Imagination Island fall away, and Bing-Bong doesn't know what to do with himself, as Sadness comes up and makes him go forward. Joy doesn't realize why this should be - why can't she cheer him up? It may or may not be obvious, which is what makes the storytelling so precise and tender and spot-on.<br/><br/>Some clichés are dealt with - have a dream with your underpants on and falling teeth, of course - and I wouldn't want it any other way in this film. Inside Out is rich in everything you want in a movie: comedy, drama, thrills, and, more than once real catharsis. It doesn't kid the kids, or the adults. You need everything inside you to be whole, is what it means to say, and it does it with brio and understanding of the human spirit."
"desiree-tehiko92","10","8","34","21 June 2015"," A true masterpiece
","I have seen many movies in my life, and many cartoons at that. At my age though you tend to watch a lot of cartoons that are funny and have a message yes, but seem to be missing something, that of a true real message, and that's what this movie achieves, WARNING, contains a spoiler, so read on at your own expense.<br/><br/>This film I would consider a true modern masterpiece, about a little girl Riley and the emotions that run her little world, and the one emotion that rules most of her world, and that being the emotion of Joy. Joy is in a way selfish, but at the same time you understand why, because everyone wants to be happy right, and that's what Joy's number one priority is, to make sure Riley grows up happy and cheery and to have memories that can make her smile, ones that define her personality, an overall happy, goofy girl with a passion for ice hockey, which in itself is a beautiful premise. Then we have the emotion you find yourself hating, and that's sadness, she's cute, but throughout she seems selfish touching all the joyous memories to make them sad, and doesn't listen to Joy when she tells her not to touch anything as she is gloomy and makes Riley, well, sad.<br/><br/>But I'll cut to the chase of the most beautiful thing about this movie. It is funny and cute, but it's actually also very sad I found myself at times holding back tears, and its not often I feel sad during a movie, but you begin to feel sad for Sadness as she feels unwanted and everything she does is not wanted by any of the emotions, in particular her opposite Joy, but this movies message begins to unravel when Joy and Sadness are sucked out of the control room and with just the other three emotions present we see that without Joy and Sadness that Riley begins to shut down and begins to lose who she is because they show us that with Anger in control for example that you begin to make irrational decisions and find that the people around you begin to dislike you because of your attitude, and that the idea of running away is a rash decision, and is in fact not the best solution at all. <br/><br/>But at the end of it all the emotions finally realise one beautiful thing, that without sadness in ones life, you cannot enjoy the simple joys in life. That in order to appreciate the things around you, the passions, people and environment that make you who you could potentially be, that you must truly experience things that are really sad so that people can help you, comfort you and that you yourself can overcome them and see the good in all the small things.<br/><br/>And in the end its finally realised by Joy that in order for Riley to grow, that Joy needs to give up control and have all of them take an equal role in letting Riley gain the experiences she needs to become the person who she needs to be, and that sadness is not bad at all, but there to help us overcome some of the hardest challenges in our lives, so that eventually we can eventually find and appreciate the joys in something else, and with this realisation we also see that instead of having singular emotional memories that as Riley gets older we start to see memories that are a combination of several emotions, to help us see the way we change as humans, that we learn to cope with many emotions at the same time, to help guide us and make us stronger people in life and that overall to have joy we must have sadness and vice versa.<br/><br/>Fantastic!"
"Darkhorse_Knight","10","8","34","20 June 2015"," DHKR: Inside Out- A Film for The Aspiring Cynic
","I personally had a lot to worry about what was to come from this movie. Most of which came from the recent trailers that show off what looked like a whimsical adventure of the most generic kind. You know how those would end up, start to finish; The two would butt heads and eventually they would make up and learn to accept one's differences, the usual Disney schlock. Coming from DAS(Disney's Animated Studios), that wouldn't be a surprise, but this here is Pixar. Pixar is known for quality, as well as it's ability to touch audiences both young and old. This couldn't be, no, it shouldn't be just another bloated, clichéd filled ball of puss from the House of Mouse's dumpster, part of the likes of Tomorrowland and the Live Action 'remake' of Cinderella, or worse, the majority of the DAS films.<br/><br/>However, when the film shown actually came out, all such fear had begun to wash away. It may be small for the average movie goer, but to me, this film was the equivalent to baptism. This is truly is worthy of being called a Pixar movie and then some. The whole film itself, the way it deals with emotions, the emotional state of a child at a young age, how the emotions can react and fully create a schism between both life and reason, it all just works perfectly. I could praise the film day and night by it's premise alone, and we haven't scratched the surface.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the whole story, i.e. what actually causes the the whole ""Adventure"" in the deep subconscious of Riley revolves around the utter control, almost stubbornness of Joy. Joy is exactly who you'd expect her to be; She's a hyper, spunky, super optimist that has created the most of the ""Core Memories"" that created the personality of Riley. It's such a big deal, utmost, to a point that the opposite emotion(most notably, Sadness) cannot come close to such memories in the case that it may ""poison"" or ""corrupt"" such a joyous thought to a dark, crushing reality that it may have another side to the exact same coin.<br/><br/>Soon, a ""Blue"" Core Memory crafted by Sadness appears, and Joy does everything to stop it from being uploaded to what I can only call Riley's ""Personality Matrix"". In trying to stop this ""Sabotage"" Joy has released the other five Core Memories out and a vacuum sucks them out of the central command. Irony can be a cold hearted woman, can't she. Especially during this, quite possibly the most emotional part of young Riley's life. All that's in charge now are the three most Primal emotions; Fear, Disgust, and Anger. The trinity of every cynic.<br/><br/>Here, I felt worried that the movie would slip into a single sided argument. Each of these three emotions are associated with cynicism, and therefore are evil and shouldn't be chased. films like Tomorrowland, while it isn't a 'bad' film, unfortunately slip into said territory. However, that doesn't happen here in Inside Out, as everything done by them is only because Joy had taught them to ""take control with positivity"". Fear, Disgust, and Anger try to do only what Joy would do, and they do it wrong because it goes against what they are programed to do. Fear is to fearful, Disgust is too picky, and Anger is far too short-sided and tempered. <br/><br/>Throughout the adventure, we see that Riley's world, thanks to the lack of core memories, is deteriorating and falling into darkness. It's an awful sight to behold, and its to be noted that all of this could've been avoided if Joy didn't try to interfere with the Core Memories and their formation. It feels good and refreshing to see a children's film take something as big and as easily screwable as positive and negative emotions, and see them all come take it with the utmost maturity. If this was DAS, I'm sure it would've gone in a completely different direction.<br/><br/>The climax comes near the end. In an effort to not spoil the ending, I'll just say it's one of Pixar's darkest turns, one of it's well intended endings, and one of it's most touching moments, all Tic-Tac-Toe'd in something I can only say could ever come once in any film company's lifetime. Don't be surprised if you find out earlier, but it's a good one. <br/><br/>Inside Out is one of Pixar's greatest achievements in cinematic history. With it's bright and colorful atmosphere that blends both moments of pure happiness and heartbreaking sorrow, it's mature subject matter that is told and expressed maturely, and it's amazing storytelling, it's setting the standards of all other great movies to come out in the near future. Animated or not.<br/><br/>It's the Crown Jewel of the Summer's movie surge. Go and give it a look, and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Final Result: 5-Stars. S-Ranking"
"Ramascreen","10","8","34","17 June 2015"," One the best films I've seen this year! Welcome back, Pixar!
","Last year we didn't get a Pixar movie, and the year before that, the only thing they gave us the fans was that easily forgettable ""Monsters University,"" so it's good to see Pixar returning, full force, with this latest masterpiece, INSIDE OUT, which reminds us of how good Pixar is when they make well-written, well thought-out heartfelt original stories instead of sequels. INSIDE OUT is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I hope it would ultimately be a potential Oscar contender come award season because it deserves all the success.<br/><br/>The way to describe Pixar's INSIDE OUT without wording it too much is that basically the minute you sit in that theater's seat to watch this movie, you're practically enrolled in Pixar's study of adolescent psychology 101. But I can assure, it's more fun than your regular boring class lectures. Co-directed by the man behind my #1 all-time favorite Pixar movie, ""Up,"" Oscar-winning filmmaker Pete Docter and along with Ronaldo Del Carmen and scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, they crafted this elaborate, engaging and entertaining story that essentially could help parents everywhere who suddenly have to face the fact that their kids are no longer the little adorable kids they once knew; that stage between childhood and teenage years without necessarily going into the teenage years because Pixar is not in the business of doing horror movies. All joking aside, this movie wants to explain, in a very Pixar way, how young ones may resist change but that change is ultimately something to be accepted, and the emotions they go through in order to deal with that change.<br/><br/>INSIDE OUT introduces 5 different emotions and present them in five very eccentric characters: Joy, anger, sadness, disgust, and fear. I'm not sure how many emotions we humans biologically have but Pixar settles on these five. And each of them is very into who they are, for example, fear would extremely be afraid at all times and joy can be so optimistic that she sounds annoying, makes you want to just punch her and tell her to shut the hell up. These five emotions live to serve a little girl named Riley who had a beautiful childhood, evidenced by her many fun and loving memories. Her childhood is every kid's envy, not that her family is rich but that her parents and friends were always there for her, and she loved her school, her neighborhood, her town. Until the day when Riley's family has to move to San Francisco and it's a completely drastic change for Riley. Joy is somewhat of the leader of this emotion command control, the rest would look up to her when they don't know what to do or when they don't know which emotion Riley should be feeling. And in Joy's mind, Riley should literally always be up and happy all the times. And that's when sadness comes in and feels compelled to touch the core memories. Long story short, without spoiling any critical plot points. Joy and Sadness end up by themselves, separated from the others, and away from the control room, so they have to find their way back and it's not an easy journey.<br/><br/>The concept itself is brilliant, Pete and his filmmaking team created these 'Islands' to represent certain aspects that we humans may be surrounded with as a child: friendship, family, the ability to be goofy. But as we grow up, those islands will crumble. In their journey back, Joy and Sadness encounter imagination character named Bing Bong and at first when I watched the movie, I thought Bing Bong was going to be the antagonist, but there's not really an antagonist in this story. Even these emotions themselves, just like Riley, would have to learn that things aren't always going to stay the same forever. The animation is Pixar's most pristine work yet. The moment Riley was born, the emotions miraculously existed and their hair and body look like they're made up of some sort of sparkling floating firefly lights of blue, green, yellow, red, and purple, like you want to get close and just examine them in details.<br/><br/>Pete Docter was very smart to have cast this amazing group of funny people to voice these emotions. Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as disgust, and the legendary Lewis Black as Anger. I mean c'mon here, all these guys are practically born to voice these particular emotions, especially Lewis Black who's spent most his career being labeled the angry comedian, that's how he banks his humor. The stars are aligned for INSIDE OUT. The tone is what you'd expect in a Pixar movie, a mix of fun, thrill, adventure and moments that can make you cry, but it's a healthy cry, composer Michael Giacchino's music knows which buttons to push to get those tears flowing. I don't think INSIDE OUT means to tell parents that this is what you should or shouldn't do. It's simply an illustration, Pixar-style, describing that change is inevitable, it's part of growing up, but if you'll be there for your loved ones and just listen to them, they'll invite you to be part of that change and that's family moving forward."

","Disney Pixar's ""Inside Out"" is one movie that will stay in my ""cinematic joy"" memory bank for a long time. This creative gem focuses on a tween named Riley who moves from Minnesota to San Francisco with her family. Writer-Directors Pete Doctor and Ronnie Del Carmen develop this fascinating film by focusing on the mental emotions inside Riley by developing characters of her emotions; which include Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Not to sound like a Debbie Downer, but my personal cerebral character of the picture was Sadness; actress Phyllis Smith did a stellar vocal performance as Sadness, which ironically brought me much joy in laughter. Anyways, back to the narrative. When things go wrong inside Riley's brain when Joy is jumped out from Riley's memory headquarters, Riley becomes disillusioned about her new life in San Francisco and finds no joy in it. Joy, alongside Sadness, must find their way back to Riley's Cerebral Headquarters before she loses all emotion. Other solid vocal performances came straight outta the mouths of Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, and Mindy Kaling as Disgust. ""Inside Out"" is one smart computer-animated flick you should delve inside to and check out. ***** Excellent"
"gaussvincent","9","7","29","15 July 2015"," It's a great MOVIE.
","Pixar limited the emotions to Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust because if they had other complex emotions or more emotions things would've been complicated and it would have bogged down the movie. They could've had Jealousy, Greed, and a plethora of other different but similar emotions. There are no ""original"" ideas especially in media creation (Movies, TV shows, Games, etc.) The ""stereotypical"" emotions of others wasn't because they didn't have great writing, it was because it was poking fun at a cliché. It's a movie and like any/all movies it has some plot holes/parts that don't make sense in the big picture. I liked the idea of exploring the psyche of the mind, I think they did a great job but they didn't feel in depth, they barely skimmed the surface. ""The positive reviews that are misleading."" What? Reviews cannot be misleading, they are opinions and opinions cannot mislead. Each review is a personal preference about the movie as a whole or a certain part of the film. The ""unbearable"" part, where Joy and Sadness are always slowed down by some sort of obstacle again and again is Movie Padding, it's not a great movie technique but all movies have it. (Especially now a days.) Anyway, I think the characters are well thought out, but some of them feel placed in some scenes just to have them there. The story is great, but like I said the padding/filler makes some scenes long winded. And no, I don't go to Disneyland ""20"" times a year, I haven't been since I was 3, and I don't have any interest to go. I would say that at the very least this movie deserves a 7(lowest score.) I wouldn't say its Pixar's finest but I wouldn't say it's their worst."

","Pixar's Inside Out is incredibly refreshing. It is one of those rare instances when an animation film succeeds to deliver on every level, it is touching, emotional, funny, extremely artistic and imaginative. <br/><br/>Our antagonists are the emotions that drive a 13 year old girl named Riley. We have Joy, Sadness, Anger Fear and Disgust. Like any child growing up, Riley experiences various sad and happy events and her emotions act accordingly, many times in hilarious and sarcastic ways. Every character is thus driven by their own emotions and everyone's emotions, even though they are the same, look and act differently, shaping and growing along with their rightful owner.<br/><br/>What is most striking about inside out is how creative and clever it is. Yet, nothing is ever overcomplicated or confusing. One would assume that an animation film about the adventures of emotions in a girls mind can get really out of hand, Inside Out is the complete opposite. Everything is touchingly logical and simple, from the train of thought and 'memory islands' to the 'cleaners' that get rid of useless memories. Whilst watching you are almost wondering: 'is this really what could be happening inside my head? '<br/><br/>The animations are very vivid yet soft, supporting Pixar's consistent style. The plot itself is interesting and very thought provoking due to the nature of the underlying idea. It something that both kids and adults can deeply relate to. That idea is so creative, with a capital C, that it almost wouldn't have mattered what the plot was, I would have been more then happy to just explore different characters' emotions and their behaviors. And these are the feelings that a truly good film should evoke. <br/><br/>Inside Out, by a long mile, is the best animation film released this year."
"Aimar_the_hobbit","10","8","35","22 August 2015"," One of the best Pixar films
","I almost gave this film a pass because its trailer looked uninviting. I'm glad I did see it. To me, this is the best Pixar film since Wall-E!<br/><br/>Inside Out depicts the complexity of human emotions in the simplest way ever - through the five characters that represent core emotions; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. It shows the significance of all of them. One would not forever live with only Joy, and Sadness could sometimes be meaningful to life. Fear, Disgust and Anger are also basic emotions that can save us from danger or unwanted situations.<br/><br/>Apart from emotions, Inside Out shows how our memories are stored and recalled. The part of Riley's memories with her childhood friend, Bing Bong, had me crying hard because it reminded me of my childhood friends too.<br/><br/>There are many good things the audience can get from viewing this film. They may understand their emotions better. Parents and kids may communicate more effectively once they have seen this film. In any case, a sure thing this film has contributed is a masterpiece to the animation world."
"eirboe","10","8","35","27 July 2015"," ""YES we have a soul but it's made of lots of tiny robots!""
","What interested me most while watching Inside Out was that the five emotions occupying Riley's 'headquarters' (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear) themselves seemed to be capable of several emotions (namely, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear). Who is controlling them, who is again controlling them, and where does this infinite regress end? Please look up the impossibility of Descartes's dualism if you want a full understanding on my opinion on this matter. While the story of Riley's family moving from Minnesota to San Francisco is itself fairly simple and uneventful, compared to what we usually expect from a feature film (yet touching to the point where I and my date shed a tear or ten in the theater), Inside Out's originality and genius comes from explaining the multitude of consciousnesses that comprises Riley's consciousness. Riley isn't just Riley, she is the previously named characters behind the control desk of her decision making. Is she being controlled by numerous homunculi, or are the homunculi her, controlling herself? How can Riley possibly choose to be joyful (as she tries), when Joy is thrown away from the 'headquarter'? Is Joy and Sadness hurting Riley by awakening the terrors of her subconscious, or does she do this to herself? Is Joy's love for Riley the part of Riley that loves herself, or is it a separate character's love for another's'? How is 'the family finally understanding each other', different from 'the different parts of Riley understanding each other in the end'? Is the family analogous to the different parts of Riley's 'self', as the family in the end comfort each other just like Joy and Sadness does? Is the harmony of the people in your life just as important as the harmony of the different parts of yourself? Is there any important difference between the different parts of yourself, and the different people on this planet? Inside Out illuminates a dimension every movie (and perhaps every real person) has. Forrest Gump, Vito Corleone, Rain Man, Aragon, George Bailey, Rick Blaine and Norman Bates all have a personality competing with itself. So why not make all the competing parts of one's personality into a separate character? Inside Out had the genius idea to try this, and it does just that! Pixar should begin an animated series showing the internal conflict of every divided fictional or factional person in history. What would the inside battle of Churchill, Gandhi, Hitler, Napoleon, Jeanne d'Arc, Aristotle, you or me look like (assuming that these people indeed are/were divided)? Have you ever been faced with a dilemma, fought against a part of yourself (even something as simple as an annoying tune stuck in your head), or disliked a part of yourself? Inside Out shows you how all these problems are actually different characters, fighting other characters inside your head. In Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, the characters carry their soul externally, instead of internally like we and the (human) characters from Inside Out does. When the characters in Pullman's trilogy reach adulthood, their soul (always in the shape of an animal) are fixed, and can no longer change between being different animals. Bear this in mind when you see how the adults in Inside Out seem to be in more harmony with themselves, than the children does. Riley's homunculi's (the protagonists of the story) struggle with each other is the main source of conflict in the film. The boy who in the end falls in love with Riley seems to have an even more chaotic 'headquarter'. What is 'growing up' of it is not a growing harmony of the different parts of yourself? Just like Pullman used an original way to portray our soul, so does Inside Out, in an even more miraculous way (in my humble opinion). Pixar is back on top of the game, back to Toy Story 3, Wall-E and Up. This time the company takes on even more perplexing philosophical issues, and I love them for it. As the only adult in the theater who took a date, and not my children to the movies, I cannot say how much of a children's film Inside Out is. But as a film, it is fun, insightful and original, and gets my 10/10."

The illustration and behaviour of the different emotions is very interesting to watch, and the ways in which they affect Riley's behaviour is also fun to watch. The characters are very well- illustrated and appear likable, and the emotions' interactions with each other don't make them lose their identities as either anger, joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. Still, they are able to take on some aspects of each other's personalities in away that doesn't compromise their own. Inside Out is very simple, compared to many other Disney Movies, but enjoyable nonetheless. It is very smooth and natural, and some knowledge in psychology helps in understanding many parts. The movie could have been better if the plot was more diverse.<br/><br/>*8.5/10*"

"maxxishere","8","6","24","13 August 2016"," Lovely realistic movie that pulls at your heart strings.
","I personally had just watched this movie recently after hearing many good things about it. I was interested in it because it deals with emotions and I am very interested in the psychology of the mind. Let me start by stating that I am not a die hard Disney or pixar fan, Im not one to sit down and watch a cartoon movie but was compelled to this one so I sat and I watched, what ensued was emotion. I laughed, a cried, I felt. This movie from the perspective of an 11 year old girl who is torn away from her friends, school and hockey team. I am imagine this is how she would feel because I too at one point was an 11 year old girl who was forced into foster care and torn away from friends, family and everything I knew. I can feel for Riley, I remember going to a new school for the first time and feeling scared, nervous and absolutely terrified. Crying in front of a whole class! Holy crap that would be mortifying and I have done it too and it is mortifying, I've eaten by myself in a corner. I also ran away from home although I wasn't as young as Riley. I loved that Pixar depicted such a loving, happy home because I didn't have that growing up, seeing this helped me to see what normal looks like and to many kids out there who don't come from non dysfunctional families I think this might show them what a happy, healthy home can look like. This movie tugged at my heart strings both because Riley had the home and parents I did not and also because I was so happy that she did, I know its a kids movie but I think it goes much deeper, I cant imagine Im the only one who felt so deeply and moved watching this. <br/><br/>I also commend the makers for making this movie I think it will help many adults and children who struggle with emotions. Seeing that sadness is needed and not a waste of time. We can't bury our emotions and all of them mean something even the not so great ones. It was awesome to see empathy modeled when Sadness listen to Bing Bong. <br/><br/>It was heart warming that Joy wanted so desperately to return to her rightful place. Coming from someone who has struggled with depression, wow! That struggle of joy being lost and needing to get back to its right place is so real. Showing that rightfully our true state is happiness and joy is so comforting. This is more a PSA than a regular ole Pixar movie. This should be shown to all kids when they are young and then talked about with them after. <br/><br/>I loved so much that the movie ended on a happy note with Riley coming home to her parents and not being shamed or yelled at but being held and comforted. It was perfect parent modeling. After it shows it fast forwarded a bit where Riley is now on a new hockey team and she is embarrassed that her parents are making such a big deal, they love her so much and it shows, they are so supportive. Riley then bumps into a boy and it shows inside his head that everything is going crazy because a girl just talked to him. Haha! I can relate man..wow. I wish there was more and so I could see how Riley grows up. Such an awesome movie."
"artscommented","9","12","60","6 June 2015"," Pixar has done it again!
","Best movie I've seen this year, so far! Easily! I've been anxiously waiting for this movie since I first heard about it, in August 2013. I attended an event where a clip was shown and I was immediately hooked. So, even though ""Inside Out"" comes out in the U.S. on June 19, I was able to see an advance screening this week! And it did not disappoint me!<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is to ""meet the little voices inside your head"", which I find interesting per se, especially since we are talking about an animated movie. So we are introduced to Riley: a 11-year-old girl from Minnesota who has to move to San Francisco with her family. How does Riley feel about that? Well, her emotions tell us! We meet Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) and Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kaling). They stay in the brain's ""headquarters"", and they control every reaction Riley has thorough the day and organize her memories when she goes to sleep.<br/><br/>Joy tries to take control over almost everything and doesn't let the other emotions in charge, especially Sadness. So, when Sadness touches a hardcore joyful memory and turns it into a sad one, things start to get a little messy inside Riley's head. Joy tries to fix it, but she and Sadness end up being transported out of the headquarters and into the other parts of Riley's brain, so the girl is left only with Anger, Disgust and Fear.<br/><br/>The movie is brilliant across the board: the script is original, the casting is perfect (Lewis Black really is the personification of Anger), the running time is adequate, the animation is beautiful, etc. It was a really smart move to show only 5 emotions, even though we have many more. It makes it simpler and smoother to watch. There is one thing about the script that worries me is how it's going to be translated into other languages. What makes it brilliant is the number of words and expressions they play with, like ""train of thought"": they put an actual train inside her head. This expression, however, is not the same in Portuguese, for example. So I believe the movie will lose a little bit when it gets translated, but it's still extremely good.<br/><br/>Like most Pixar movies, it has a very strong connection to adult audiences, so probably children won't get all the jokes and references, but their parents certainly will. It also shows us, beautifully, how we shouldn't try to suppress any emotion, because every moment in our lives consist of different emotions and all those experiences shape us. This may seem obvious to adults, but it's good to show it to children, who are the demographic Pixar is aiming. But adults can certainly enjoy the way it's portrait.<br/><br/>This will probably be a big success for Pixar and it got outstanding reviews during the Cannes Festival last month. This is certainly good for the studio, since it had lost its touch in the last movies (don't get me started on ""Brave"" and ""Cars 2""). The problems inside Pixar were evident last year, when the studio decided not to release ""The Good Dinosaur"" due to script problems. So 2015 will be the first year we'll have two Pixar movies.

"atlasmb","8","7","30","16 January 2016"," A Touching Film, Well Designed
","Obviously ""Inside Out"" is not for everyone. Just look at the volume of negative reviews on IMDb. I must agree that this film is meant more for adults than children. The concepts are too sophisticated or abstract. But that is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film very much. It must be recognized that undertaking this film was ambitious and risky. Ambitious because it could not have been easy to conceptualize characters that represent emotions and the ""world"" they occupy. Risky, because the very concept of the film might not have attracted many viewers. Clearly they were trading on the stellar reputation that Pixar enjoys. Frankly, I was concerned that the film might have many hidden/subliminal messages about gender, societal roles, etc. But it does not. The focus of the film is enjoyment.<br/><br/>One reviewer criticized the film's implication that we all are controlled by our emotions (and therefore do not have free will). I understand the concern, but there are other parts of the brain that control other operations, including motor skills, reasoning, etc. The film's depiction of memories shows how they affect our interactions with our environment. They enable us to learn (a process that involves evaluation and reason), but they are ""colored"" by associated emotions. <br/><br/>The internal world of ""Inside Out"", where the emotions and other characters live and interact, is a triumph of imagination. They have mapped an environment where internal workings of the human brain reflect our knowledge of its operations with consistency. At the same time, it's a fun world which allows for an enjoyable storyline, though there are moments of suspense and sadness. In the past, Pixar has made us cry for the fate of toys and insects; now they have done it for emotions and memories.<br/><br/>Speaking of touching moments...how about that dedication at the end of the credits: ""This film is dedicated to our kids. Please don't grow up. Ever."""

"leonblackwood","5","7","30","2 December 2015"," Brilliant animation with an average storyline! 5/10
","Review: I really liked the concept of this movie because it was fresh and original but I was a bit disappointed with the outcome. Like many Pixar movies, it looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but the storyline dried up after a while and I personally thought that it was a bit confusing for little kids. It's about a young girl called Riley, voiced by Kaitlyn Dias, who moves to San Francisco from Minnesota with her parents and finds it hard to fit in. Whilst going through her transitions, we get to look at her Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness emotions which are going through turmoil after her Joy and Sadness emotions lose some of her core memories. After retrieving the memories, they struggle to get back to there headquarters which means that Riley is stuck with her Fear, Anger and Disgust emotions. When Joy and Sadness manage to get back to there headquarters, Riley is able to lead a normal life in her new house but as she gets older, the headquarters becomes bigger because of her many new emotions, including puberty. Its a clever storyline with some funny moments but I would have liked to see the other emotions a bit more, especially Anger, who made me laugh. The bonus material on the DVD should have been used in the film because it was brilliant. It showed the different emotions of her dad and mother while Riley was going out with a boy, so if you get your hands on the DVD/Blu- ray, you really have to give it a watch. Anyway, there isn't much adult material, like in other Pixar movies but it's fun for the whole family. I did miss the catchy songs and the usual mean villain but there is enough material to keep it interesting. My expectations are always high when it comes to Pixar animation movies so I did feel a bit let down with the outcome. It's not the type of film that I can watch time and time again like Toy Story or the Incredibles but if you want to keep the kids quiet, it's worth a purchase. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: After reading the reviews and seeing the box office takings, this film really went down a storm with audiences but I failed to find it that amazing. The vibrant colours and joyful storyline is a great escape from the doom and gloom of everyday life, so I can understand why people rushed to the cinema to see it. There are a couple of famous stars who voiced the characters, like Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, Diane Lane as Mom and Kyle MacLachlan as Dad but there not that noticeable. The film was directed by Pete Doctor, 47, who brought you the emotional Up and Monsters, Inc. and he also wrote Wall-E, Toy Story I & II, so he has had much success in his career so far. It was also directed by Ronnie Del Carmen but he hasn't made any other movies yet.  Anyway, I enjoyed some elements of the movie but on the whole, I have sent better films in this genre. <br/><br/>Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $851.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies voiced by Amy Poehler, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Oz and Phyllis Smith. 5/10"

","Pixar kicks start the film with a beautiful opening score and slowly introduces the emotion characters throughout the platform of a simple normal growth experience of an 11-year-old girl. The plot is familiar but the creativity and conceptualisation of Pixar to tell the story from inside the mind of a girl using five different emotions - joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear have brought their latest picture to secure the Oscars. Not only focusing on the emotions, the story further expands into memories (short/ long-term and core memories), imagination, dreams and forgetfulness in a fantastic landscape to construct the feeling, mind, reaction and soul of the main character. This original approach connects well both the adults and children, emotionally engaging, entertaining, visually colorful and inspiring. The level of intellectual and emotional daring are consistent until the end of this major emotion animation, reminding audiences the balancing of all these five feelings that leads to the human's capability of love and affection."

"filipemanuelneto","10","2","5","22 September 2019"," Intellectual and intelligent, its perhaps the most adult animated film Pixar has ever released.
","This animated film is undoubtedly one of the most original and creative I've seen in a long time, and all because of the script, portraying the way emotions (transformed into the characters Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear) influence the actions and behaviors of a young girl who has just moved with her parents to a new city. Intelligent, even intellectual, this film explains in a fun and light way how our emotions, memory and consciousness work, among other complex topics associated with our behavior and psyche, such as nightmares, dreams, traumas, etc.<br/><br/>Not much to say about voice actors, and I don't even know most of them. Amy Poehler, who gives voice to Joy, is the one that stands out but everyone did an excellent job. All the characters had their time to shine, but the focus of the film is on the five emotions (with a strong emphasis on Joy and Sadness) and Riley herself. There are truly moving moments throughout the film, which I don't think are intended for children, but rather for a teenage audience and young adults, able to understand what the movie is showing. Before finishing, I just want to leave a word for the well-written dialogues, with some humor in between.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the movie is flawless, as expected from a Pixar movie. Animated through advanced CGI features, it's the state of the art. Vibrant colors, good brightness, safe and realistic drawings ensure aesthetic and visual beauty, while attention to detail is visible, for example, in the way scenery and everyday objects are carefully designed. As sometimes happens in the movies of this studio, the soundtrack is not the strong dish here.<br/><br/>I was truly delighted with this movie because of the way it addresses complex and intellectual topics. But this film is not only that: it is, above all, a good story about how we deal with our dreams, longings and emotions and how they can shape, or even redefine, our character at key moments in our lives."

OK, now cut the kid and let the sane adult talk, as this is a review by an adult and not a kid.<br/><br/>This adult has a story, a teenage story of changing school, being a rebel at home, and fighting with parents and teachers all through the years that he was at a new school. I changed my school when I was thirteen and the next couple of years were hell for my parents and teachers. A student with supreme conduct, suddenly turned into a disinterested rowdy with the change of school. The new school I was put in did not have good teachers, who could sing or play. They always used to teach in the most uninteresting way, and I hated all of it.<br/><br/>OK, that's a little insight into my teenage years, but above all, this is a film that has much more than insight. I connected with this film on a deeper level, perhaps I too love reading minds. This movie is something that explores the feelings of emotions, how we react when we feel, how do we emote that feeling, it's so much more about us within than many other films, that are all about characters, plot, themes etc. This movie, could possibly be about you, check this to find that out. I found something for me and was extremely happy.<br/><br/>The director has a daughter and she is nearly the same age as the film's protagonist Riley. Now, what's her age? Go watch the film, or as some lazy bugs do, just do some Wikipedia about director, the film, his daughter etc. I am unapologetic and actually unhappy with those who read this review and do not end up watching this.<br/><br/>Technically, PIXAR has achieved more than any other animation studio in the world in terms of animation, story-telling and development of characters and trust me, this film is on par with any PIXAR film you have liked, be it FINDING NEMO or MONSTERS INC or TOY STORY or many more including WALL-E and UP.<br/><br/>Having said all that, do I still need to rate this?

It is a great family movie all about growing up and all the troubles you face. My younger sister, she is 9, said she loved it. My mother said it was a great movie but that she doesn't think it is the best she has ever seen. Hope this helps with the age group the movie appeals to."

","""I felt all of those emotions while watching this movie."" - Caroline Matthews (RRs youngest daughter)<br/><br/>Popcorn, M&Ms and a large drink. Roll the film... Pixar has not come out with an original film for quite some time. Brave was more of a Disney princess film, while Inside Out looks to introduce us to a fresh new world. How will it stand up to their catalogue of brilliant films? <br/><br/>Kid's Korner rating: 4.25 stars Parent's Rating: 4.25 stars<br/><br/>It is not easy to understand the emotions of children, but what if you were able to see their emotions being played out on the big screen? Directors Pete Docter (UP) and Ronaldo Del Carmen's new film Inside Out allows us to see into the turbulent, but humorous world of the pre-teen emotional landscape. Riley the focus of this emotional tale and she is going through a multitude of changes in her life. Things get even more challenging when her family moves from the Minnesota to San Francisco. As she is growing older, these new situations reek havoc on the emotional battlefield of Riley and her family. Over the initial days of their arrival to their new home and school, her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith), who live in Riley's 'Headquarters', try to navigate her through the emotional mine field of the past and present. Then an emotional catastrophe leads to the mixing of her emotions, her memories and her responses to life which have the potential to lead to significant, life changing results. <br/><br/>In raising three daughters who have experienced similar stages of life as Riley, this flurry of emotions came alive on screen in a hilarious, but personal way. The story felt simplistic and child-like, which made sense because these are the emotions of a pre- teenager. They are not mature characters, but the 'emotions' are growing at the same rate as the child they exist within. This is explained in finer detail by seeing the emotional landscape of Riley's parents. They contain similar characters, but with they exist with a depth that has not occurred yet in Riley's life. Inside Out is such a different experience than most animated films and it is handled with a similarly mature fashion as UP. This style of storytelling causes a shift in understanding of what it was trying convey, which ultimately was the maturing of a young girl into adulthood. Which would suggest that anyone should not go into this film expecting a typical Disney film. Without sounding too obvious, this film will play on your emotions and may cause you to consider all you have forgotten, the many things that have influenced your life and how joyful emotions are maybe even sweeter when mixed with a bit of sadness. Our family really enjoyed this film, but had to take the time to consider what it all meant to us and what it will mean for our youngest child in the future. <br/><br/>The writing and directing of the lead characters of the film bring in the needed qualities of the Pixar films we have come to love over the years. It is funny and well written which caused laugh out loud moments, potential times of fear and a multitude of tears throughout the theatre. In the same vein as UP, the themes were meant for the tween to adult audience, but it still can be enjoyed by younger children. The younger set may need some explanations of the deeper emotional elements on screen. Inside Out falls squarely in the middle of the pack of the Pixar quality productions, not the best film, but still an excellent film that delivers a joyful experience for the family.<br/><br/>Dad asked the question on the ride home, 'What did I think of the film?' I felt all of those emotions while watching this movie. I really liked the film even more after we talked about it afterwards. It was funny and I really like the Bing Bong (Richard Kind) character. He was funny and sad at the same time. Talking with Dad, I thought Inside Out was really good. <br/><br/>Caroline's Top Pixar films: Finding Nemo Monsters, Inc.

"hoxjennifer","8","7","31","15 November 2015"," Inside out: a tale of growing up
","I'll have to agree that this film was over-hyped. I was expecting it to be as amazing as Minions or Finding Nemo, but that's not to say it's bad either. Inside Out has the perfect balance of comedy, emotion and intelligence - yes that's right, this is a truly intelligent movie. It's stocked with metaphors and is pretty deep for a kid's movie. I read that one of the ""goofs"" was that Fear tried to get sucked out of the same tube that Joy and Sadness got taken away in and it failed. Personally, I didn't see that as a goof, but it was purposeful. All the events that happen inside Riley's mind have a purpose - joy and sadness get lost, leaving emotions like Fear, Anger and Disgust take over. Natural feelings that anyone would have in a new city, with no new friends, at the young, precarious age of 11. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, you can look at this film from a few perspectives, but I think it's a story about coming of age. It's about learning to accept that as you get older, things become more complicated, and feelings of joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust cannot be isolated feelings like when you're a child... they can be integrated, and compliment each other. Sometimes it takes sadness to feel happiness. <br/><br/>I don't think this is Pixar's best, but it's still a really good movie. A great watch for all ages."

","Inside Out is a sweet, funny and sometimes heartbreakingly sad adventure that deserves an Academy Award nomination for best picture. Touches on depression but just cutesy enough for kids to understand. The writing is funny and witty for all ages. I do wish at times there was a little more fun and laughter considering it is a child's movie but definitely can see them making a sequel. Pixar has once again reminded us just how magical the right combination of story and storyteller can be Not to mention that the cast was incredible, especially when it came to the main characters Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith)."

","Inside out is a movie worth seeing. If you have kids, go see it. If you are a teenager that enjoys Pixar movies, go see it. If you are a human being, go. see. it.<br/><br/>It's a typical Pixar film, funny intro, then after 10 minutes something happens that changes the life of our protagonist and in the end everything is solved. But still SO enjoyable.<br/><br/>You will laugh, you will feel bad, it may take you into an emotional roller-coaster if you let them, this movie is so good that if you take your kids to see it maybe you will enjoy it as much or more than them.<br/><br/>Also, Bill Hader is hilarious on this one.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 9 just because it has so many Pixar clichés that make the movie so predictable, nevertheless, go. see. it."
"Starbuck823","9","6","26","20 June 2015"," Pixar Originality
","One of the things that always stood out about Pixar films was the originality of the concept. Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, all such wonderful concepts that tickled the imagination of both kids and adults. In recent years, it seemed they had lost the touch - Cars 2, Monsters University and even Brave - while all not terrible films, it seemed that Pixar had lost a bit of their original flair.<br/><br/>Inside Out brings us back to the Pixar of old with a wonderful telling of life changes and handling emotions. Fear, Joy, Anger, Disgust and Sadness are the main characters who occupy our brains and rule our actions with their responses.<br/><br/>As the trailers summaries, we see the story of Riley - who is an eleven year old girl who mostly has joyful experiences and thus Joy is the primary character in her head. We see that other emotions get a part but Sadness mostly is ignored and is pushed to the side. Then we see how things change when they family move to San Francisco. This is when drama occurs and Joy and Sadness get sucked away from HQ and have to find their way back.<br/><br/>The concept of the emotions in the HQ are wonderful but the whole world of the brain, memories, imagination and thinking are both clever and wonderful. We see how Riley can so easily change without a balance of emotions which can result in change in her memories, her personality and her actions.<br/><br/>I don't want to go to much further in detail as it will spoil the story telling but it is very well thought out and has many clever layers to the characters and concepts. This is where I think it might be too clever - I was surprised kids lasted as long as they did and I suspect some of the concepts might be to much for the younger crowed. There are numerous funny parts, colourful visuals and comic actions to keep them occupied but overall, the movie feels it might be more suited to pre-teens rather than the younger crowds. Joy and Sadness's journey comes with some revelations which aren't complex but I really think the older group will understand and appreciate the full meaning.<br/><br/>One other thing I found was that the film was perhaps fifteen minutes too long - the journey and its lessons could have been completed a little quicker and I found myself thinking ""come on"" when it got extended yet again. Again, I'm surprised kids didn't get a little rowdier in the slower parts. The ending was touching and rounded out the movie nicely. I particularly liked seeing into other peoples (and animals) heads - it pulled good laughs while still being cute. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is fantastic but it is a touch too long and the target audience may not fully appreciate it however I am sure the many parents taking their kids to this movie will. Inside Out is beautiful visually and shows a wonderfully original concept told with a lot of heart so I think its minor flaws will be mostly forgiven and many people will gain a lot of enjoyment out of this film."
"paddyolguin","9","7","32","23 October 2015"," Love or Hate, that is the question
","--- There are some spoilers after the 2nd paragraph ---!!<br/><br/>Oh the irony. The message of this movie is that we humans need to feel all of our emotions in order to... be human, and yet the reviews fall into only two of those - Joy or Anger. If you are an intuitive empathizing personality, you're going to enjoy this movie. You'll laugh and cry. You'll appreciate ""Joy"" for her flaws as well as her positive attitude! As for it being a horrible movie, it obviously isn't to everyone; read all the positive reviews. The people who love it aren't crazy, nor are those who hate it. It's interesting to me that the chief complaint is that it's depressing. What? Didn't you people pay attention to Up, Toy Story 1, 2, 3, Finding Nemo, Cars... any of the PIXAR films you supposedly love? They are chock full of anger, loss, betrayal, death, loneliness, co-dependence, greed, addiction (Fish are Friends, not food!) - all very adult themes. Who didn't cry their eyes out, TWICE, at the end of Toy Story 3? At the beginning of Up? Jessie singing ""When Somebody Loved Me?"" Those scenes are gut-wrenching. Dark Themes? Go review the plot lines to Up and Toy Story 3. Seriously.<br/><br/>As for Disney/PIXAR stealing stories, I hate to break this to you, but every movie plot since the Seven Samurai has been stolen from a previous story. There are no new plot lines. That is not a valid complaint. The truth is, you liking this movie or not is nearly 100% about you, not PIXAR.<br/><br/>-- spoilers --- Inside Out isn't about self-absorption, it's about self-awareness. It's about Joy's misguided mission to keep Riley happy all the time, until she finally realizes that at Riley's turning point, she needs to feel sad, or she risks feeling nothing at all. For anyone who's dealt with depression, we (happily) see this coming, and fully understand that in order for there to be Joy in Riley's life, she has to express/let-go of pain by feeling sad, thus the blue-yellow memory marble of Joy and Pain/Sadness coupled together. But I suppose analytical, emotionally-cutoff viewers were too busy heading for the exits. Too bad. The neurology lesson is fun and creative. Yes, you might have had to pay attention in your Psych 101 class. Don't blame Disney for that.<br/><br/>As for it not being a kid movie, my nine-year old son, who has Autism, loved the movie. Seeing emotions vividly illustrated made sense to him."
"ryanwu","10","7","32","12 July 2015"," The essence of the minds of Pixar
","The essence of Pixar can truly be evaluated in this movie. It directs the audiences through joy, excitement and sadness. The minds behind this film are brilliant, they have reached for the sky! My personal favourite was the character Riley, she really hit me hard, when I thought about it, isn't this the phase we all went through? Pixar's brilliant minds also made the character Sad is really lovable. From smart jokes, to heartening scenes, she brings audiences waves and waves of laughter. Also to look forward to is the short movie Lava (Played before the movie) which is romantic and funny. Overall in total, Inside Out is one of my favourite movies and will be on the list for a very long time, it's creative, funny, sad and heartening! The movie I can assure you if you are a fan of Pixar movies, or you've got a few hours to kill, this is the perfect movie for you! Keep up the pace Pixar!"

","For me, modern day animated films can be a tough sell. I love animation and have since I was a child. I grew up watching a lot of the Walt Disney cartoons that kids today still watch and love. As, I grew older I got interested in more adult oriented animated films such as the work of Ralph Bakshi, Bill Plympton and films such as Gerald Potterton's Heavy Metal. I also found as I grew up that I was not really all that interested in 3D animation which really seemed to be taking off. To me it looked like you were staring at a computer program, or game and I felt it lacked emotion and a lot of the story relied on the new age type of effects and techniques the animators could now use with these computer programs and techniques. I also found the writing of the films got lazier and it just overall did not win me over at all. There were some good exceptions within the last 15 years, or so of some really good animated films such as Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away as well as Sylvain Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville. Such beautifully animated and extremely creative and well written animated films like these were unfortunately becoming a rarity. A lot of the stuff Disney and it's collaboration with Pixar, was unfortunately not working for me all that much either as I found that they often had a hard time of balancing whether to make a film that worked for both adults and kids and I sometimes found that as above mentioned, that I had problems with the 3D animation and the writing relied too heavily on this new technology and effects. There were a few exceptions, but to me something like the Shrek films (I know these are Dreamworks films and not Pixar) and films of that kind which were heavily praised and adored, were to me extremely overrated. Thankfully now with Inside Out, we are getting back to a type of animated film that has animation I like as well as a great story, creativity and will definitely work for both the adult and child audiences going to see the film. This film takes a premise of something that I think we can all relate to and makes a fascinating and very creative movie out of it, that also turns out to be a lot of fun. This one however, particular interested me. The whole human brain and dealing with emotions and the human psychosis has fascinated me ever since I was a child. At a time in my life, I felt like I wanted to be a therapist, or a counselor one day and human problems, emotions and various neurosis of different people fascinated and compelled me. Through the 90's I remember being a huge fan of the animated series, Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist and found the show very humorous as well as also really enjoying the dialogue between Katz and his patients and what was meant to be humorous and was, was also fascinating to me with what makes one think, or feel, or act this way. Inside Out, takes this to a whole new level by giving five of every human's basic chemistry and emotions into fully animated and into talking characters. We have Joy (each character is named after their emotion), Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The actors who do the voice over work do a terrific job and the writers have given each a wonderfully true and yet fun and playful personality and each depicting the certain feeling that they are meant to represent. Joy (who is one of the main characters of the film) is so bubbly and just an absolute joy to watch that you get enjoyment and just feel happiness just radiating from her that she is literally a joy to watch. All the other characters each have their own priceless moments and really add to the film as well. The human characters in this story each depict average everyday people and the different emotions we go through on an everyday basis making the film easy for a viewer of any age to relate and connect to. The film is creative in both it's writing, voice over work and animation. The film takes us through many adventures and many brilliantly conceived ideas and plot devices, but also hits home once in awhile and makes us think of our own body chemistry and our own emotions at times. This is the most creative and flat our brilliant I have seen in a mainstream animated film in a long time. Inside Out works for both adults and kids and is fun, visually pleasing and has everything that should set off the perfect modern day animated film. Disney and Pixar's best in awhile."
"antoinedb2001","10","7","32","10 July 2015"," a new Pixar classic
","This a great movie, probably one of the best that I have seen from Pixar studios. <br/><br/>the story: a girl named Riley is uprooted from her old home and has moved into San Francisco. her emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust are the emotions that try to help her get through her new life in the big city. but one day when joy and sadness go missing, it's up to anger, fear, and disgust to keep things in control while joy and sadness try to find a way back to the center of Riley's mind.<br/><br/>this movie is not only the most funniest film from Pixar but also the most inventive and imaginative. you watch the movie and you just say to yourself ""genius."" let me talk about the story first. the story is just creative in the best way possible. it keeps heading down a road where the twist and turns that you make are the right ways to get to your destination. it tries to be inventive and funny and it succeeds on every level. the characters are not one dimensional as you would expect. sometimes the emotions have emotions like joy can be sadness or sadness can be joy. the voice acting is great. I simply adore Amy poler as the voice of joy. Richard king is in this movie and he plays Riley's imaginary friend named Bing bong, who is made entirely of cotton candy but also is part cat and part dolphin and Richard king does a great job as the character. the other emotions are great too with similar superior casting such as bill Hadar playing fear, Mindy Kalina playing disgust Lewis black playing anger, and Phyllis smith playing sadness. the animation is amazing. the way the characters move, talk, and act are some of the most expressive I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Though that this may be a kids film, it's also a deep movie, having themes such as: running away, crying at school, growing up, lying, losing friends, etc. one scene, as well as a few others, almost made me cry. props to the creators for achieving such a high point.<br/><br/>so on a whole, this movie is awesome. the characters, the story, the animation, the themes, the parts that make you cry are all done well. if Pixar's next movie ""the good dinosaur"" then there may be some competition at the 2016 Academy Awards."
"cool-kombo","10","3","10","26 February 2018"," One of the most intelligent movies that breaks down human emotions for kid to understand
","This might come as a shock for a lot of people who doesn't get how deep and profound this movie is, but this is one of the movies having the highest amount of emotional intelligence put into it. The complex world of human emotions and how it connects with our mind, persona, sub-conscious, long-term memory etc. has been, painstakingly but very beautifully, expressed in simple representation for kids to understand. this builds the most profound notion that even adults fail to understand - sadness is important part of life, to be expressed, and not to be ignored as society teaches you to bury it deep down and to always keep a disingenuous happy face. This movie is way ahead of its time, and I will call it nothing short of a MASTERPIECE. If you haven't watched this like 2 times minimum, you are missing out on something eye-opening and profound."
"specialagentpickle","10","3","10","5 February 2018"," You need to look deeper into this film y'all
","Many people keep calling out this film for being very depressing, poorly-developed, or whatever other reason that I don't think I can understand. But the problem is, you don't look deeper into it. Do you really expect your children to understand depression, or expect life to be all peachy and happy and beautiful and sunshiny?
Newsflash, you're ignorant. This is not reality.
As a person with depression, this film hit me hard. There's always a part of you that wants to deny the emotions that come with growing up, you want to remain happy, or neutral at the very least, for the people you love who are surrounded by stress. But in truth, when you try to avoid them, it only makes it worse. This film taught me to embrace my emotions, and be open with it to the people I trust. I was in tears as I watched this film, because while the situation was not the same as what I was going through, the emotions Riley felt and what I felt were very similar. It was what I needed to help me heal from the emotional pain that I was going through at the time. It isn't easy to teach your children that they cannot avoid pain or depression forever, so I say Inside Out is a good start to teaching them that. 
Inside Out, to me, is the best Disney movie. Emotions are a complicated topic reduced to a very simple concept in this movie. It's colorful, funny, and imaginative, all surrounding a complicated yet beautiful tale of how your feelings are normal and shouldn't be pushed away, but rather, you should be honest about them in order to heal. <br/><br/>thank you, and goodnight. -drops mic-"
"LloydBayer","10","7","33","5 August 2015"," Inventively comical yet powerfully moving, Inside Out is a winner from the start and a masterpiece throughout.
","Ever been told never to let your emotions get the best of you? Now what if you could actually see and hear those emotions emote. Welcome to Inside Out, a remarkable animation that is as original and clever as it is compelling and poignant. Simply put, another masterpiece from Pixar/Disney's library of outstanding animations. <br/><br/>From the Academy Award winning Toy Story franchise to the Academy Award winning Up (2009), the mechanism behind Pixar's storytelling prowess has always been its ability to engage children and adults simultaneously. Inside Out works pretty much the same way but on a whole new level that uses relatable metaphors to tell the story. Set inside the mind of young Riley (voice by Kaitlyn Dias), we follow her mood swings when her parents decide to move from snowy Minnesota to sunny San Francisco. Determining the outcome of her actions are emotions, each colour-coded and manifested as characters – bright and radiant Joy (Amy Poehler), blue Sadness (Phyllis Smith), purple Fear (Bill Hader), green Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and flaming red Anger (Lewis Black). While influencing Riley's decisions, these emotions also preserve her memories (based on her actions) in coloured orbs relating to a specific emotion. In turn, each stored memory (or core memory) shapes her personality. Everything happens in ""Headquarters"" or Riley's consciousness where each of her emotions strive for control over her actions. So on her first day at a new school, Riley is overcome with 'mixed emotions', brought on by a struggle between Joy and Sadness. It's an astute moment in the film that literally defines the word 'nostalgia'. But then something goes wrong, sending dominant emotions Joy and Sadness into Riley's sub consciousness. Now left with just three emotions, Riley begins a dangerous descent into depression with Fear, Anger and Disgust wreaking havoc on her personality. <br/><br/>Kicking the film into high gear is the ensuing roller-coaster ride where Joy and Sadness try to get back to Headquarters. It's also where we are introduced to other characters and instances residing in Riley's deepest memories. As such, prepare for Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's imaginary friend and one of the most charming characters in the film, whose inclusion results in a pivotal yet heart wrenching plot point in the story. Such is the powerfully overwhelming nature of this film, often leaving us stranded between Riley's fondest memories and the manifestation of painful new ones as she grows older. Perhaps one of the greatest achievements of this film is the reiteration that the magic and innocence of youth will inevitably fade away, only to be replaced with the harsh and often cynical trappings of adult perceptions. It's the same reason why Santa Claus is nothing more than a childhood fantasy. <br/><br/>Co-written and helmed by Up director Pete Doctor, Inside Out is packed with such metaphors and many more that adults will relate to. A thrilling segment where Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong must board a 'Train of Thought' to save Riley is just one of Doctor's clever puns, and as it turns out, comes loaded with comical shenanigans to keep younger viewers rollicking in their seats. Clearly, there's a lot of backend study into psychology and behavioral science, but the way it all unfolds on screen is the work of pure genius and the type that will leave you in awe – laughing one moment and speechless the next, while stifling a tear drop all through to the end."
"sandiloquent-173-548370","10","7","33","28 July 2015"," Yes. THIS.
","Many on IMDb have already made the points an ordinary review would cover, so mine's going to be a bit different. Like some more publicly recognisable critics, I'm going to write about how the movie affected me on a more personal level.<br/><br/>This is the thing. I have clinical depression and was on anti-depressants for a long time. I gave them up when I realised the problem was that I wasn't being true to myself and letting myself be sad. For as long as I needed to be. That's an incredibly short summary of a much longer process than I can go into here.<br/><br/>There had been a number of severe life shocks, all unrelated to each other, that knocked me off my pedestal several times in a row in my 30s that induced a horror of sadness that took some years to lose. That's what depression is, folks, basically. Of course it's a chemical imbalance... but the cause of the chemical imbalance is not easy to polarise from its effect. It's a feedback loop, and one of the steps in the loop is refusing to accept sadness.<br/><br/>I resigned my job and started making little bits of income here and there with no defined career path, no state assistance but enough to live, to get by. Slowly, after lots of deliberate wallowing my capacity for Joy returned. I'm still ""unemployed""... on days when I'm not gardening for money. I love it. My life is tiny and manageable. Does it bring me Joy? Well... yes. And other things, of course. But at least the console *£$%$$&!!* works now.<br/><br/>After giving up antidepressants I internally vocalised an observation about Sadness - ""No, you idiot, sadness isn't trying to hurt you, it's trying to get you to take yourself seriously. If something's sad, it's sad! There's nothing alien or wrong with being sad..."" <br/><br/>****MASSIVE spoilers after this sentence...****<br/><br/>So, I knew that Sadness would be a major feature in this movie, because I know Pixar and they are emotionally literate, developed, honest and decent. They like to make movies that mean things as well as entertain. I pretty much knew what Sadness would do in the end... not that that's any kind of boast. It wasn't particularly difficult to spot what was coming. It was obvious where the movie was going from the minute Joy stuck Sadness in that little chalk circle (Beautiful metaphor! And so simple and obvious and, uh, well, in a *kids* movie that I think people haven't yet realised what an important thing it's saying...) My having taken Riley's emotional journey myself over the two years prior to seeing this film (in my forties!!! Please, Universe, can we do something about society's engagement with male emotional development?) left me kind of insulated me from its impact (...so I told myself...), though I was nodding throughout it, very impressed, with a slightly smug sense of my own wisdom, thinking: ""yup, called it... called it"". I didn't cry during Riley's first day at school, though I should have done as I have school memories every bit as painful as that sequence, I didn't cry when any of the islands collapsed, or when Joy found the old memories and what happened to them, or when Bing Bong has his most important scene... I didn't even cry at the end when Riley opened up to her parents...<br/><br/>I didn't cry until the very end.<br/><br/>I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready for that little marble coming down the chute. I saw everything coming except that.<br/><br/>I sat, in transcendent rapture. My jaw dropped as it trundled along the rails, found it's place and ignited the next stage of Riley's life. I'm not joking, I gaped like a monkey and tears started rolling down my face as my entire soul was completely engulfed by an explosion in my chest, in exact resonance with this ridiculously simple metaphor in front of my eyes.<br/><br/>""YES! YES! YES!"" howled all of my own little guys, punching the air, watching as a little marble, the same colouring as that last one in the movie, with a little picture inside it of me watching a movie, trundled along it's own rails inside me, rolled up to the altar and settled next to the spheres which, if you peer into them, would show my resignation, red, gold and green, the day some months afterwards when my old workplace told me I couldn't temp for them after all, gold, blue and purple, the day I finished laying my first lawn... gold and purple (what if I got it wrong and the grass died...?) So.<br/><br/>I could go on and talk about how lovely and sweet and kind the character of Sadness is in the movie and what a wonderful friend she is, or how loving and truthful it is to show the inner workings of a child's mind with all that spectacular candy-coloured grandeur and how adults would need that cuddly roundness every bit as much to make this movie work for them... or how one of the major themes of my depression was my disconnection from mainstream media and it's inability or unwillingness to talk to me about my journey, though fiction had been my closest companion with me in my emotional life prior to that period of emptiness, and to find a storyteller who will tell the truth means something to me that I can hardly explain to them... Unless this review is good enough.<br/><br/>My hard drive is stuffed with unfinished short stories, half-drawn comics, digital artworks, ideas for games, two-thirds of an illustrated children's book. ""Why bother? They'll never make us rich..."" says one. ""Pah! So what?"" says another, standing next to the new marble on the altar...<br/><br/>Here comes the new island...<br/><br/>Ahhhh, Pixar. You and your timing..."

The creator of this movie is a genius along with the people in Pixar because they never disappoint us with all of these childhood movies that really touch the heartstrings when you watch them. This movie isn't anything like Osmosis Jones because that didn't have emotions in it just a whole lot of rude and crude humor about what our body and our cells are doing. But this movie shows us our emotions, personalities, & our beliefs of what we do in our life that help us out to reach our goals of what we want to accomplish in our lifetime. It has your dreams along with your favorite childhood memories and imaginary friends that love to laugh and play with you whenever you're feeling way down in the dumps. But this movie deserves a 10/10 stars because it is by far one of the most beautiful movies that I have ever seen that made me shed a whole lot of tears while watching the movie."
"stephendaxter","9","9","46","12 June 2015"," A roller-coaster of 'emotions'
","Inside out was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it definitely did not disappoint. This movie was a roller-coaster of emotions the whole way through. It sends you from happy right down to sad and a little teary really quickly and then manages to get you laughing again within a few minutes, and to be able to pull that off is incredible. Lets start with those characters - the emotions, all of the emotions were very funny in their own unique way and seeing them all interact and clash made for many hilarious moments. They were most definitely the highlight of the film and rightfully so take up most of the screen time. I honestly cannot pick a favourite because they were all so different and so damn good. The voice acting performances were just do great and they all sounded exactly the way you think they would just by looking at them. Even when they switch over to the human perspective you still get great characters in the form of Riley, and her mum and dad to keep you entertained. Also the plot was great, it didn't slow down that much at all and was hilariously entertaining, it all made sense and offered many new and original plot points to keep you constantly interested. <br/><br/>The only issue i had and a very minor one was that there were a few very short patches where the film was beginning to lose my interest a little but it very quickly got back on track and had me laughing again. In the end this was a fantastic film that has plenty of laughs for both the kids and adults, and also prepare to find yourself getting a little teary throughout the film, as it really is in fact a roller-coaster of emotion. - 9.2"

","Talking about pixar, which worshiped as one of the best animation studio, seems not bothering me. Its because pixar is a masterpiece maker in animation film. Of course, there are not much real contender to contest. Still, studio ghibli, you know, Japanese origins, was the sole and tangible competitor to pixar. Two of them distinctly are on the apex of level. But this one, inside out, a candidate and of course the winner of best animated picture in 2015 was terrific. Competing with anomalisa, 98 metacritic score plunged into 88 dramatically because of its r- rating. Yet the magnificent and beautiful the wind rises from our exalted Japanese Miyazaki. Well, that was a hard work in the wrong time, like cultivating the land in the winter. It was a season of good animated, but inside out still intrepid. it persevere the situation.<br/><br/>Writing : One thing that amaze me is the originality. I always thinking how simple the shape of plot was, but why there are no directors thought it before. Its like we all can form this kind of mind story, but we just never think and realize about it. Its too basic for us, the human being, so we never think about it. Then peter take this chance to give us the combustion to create these typical. Honestly, this mind story style can became anything he want. He can make a good drama, he can make a good scifi, even a good romance if it was handled by right director. Peter choose it to be a drama animation. Well it works too, because peter is a skillful director.<br/><br/>Art-direction : The 3-D visual effect is an up-to-date technology, no other arguments could bend that. What we see is a tremendous original one-by-one unique mind-character with color identity. Either these will made the audience easier too know the characters, its also depict as symbolic of human- nature. That what makes Inside Out an Universal-typical movie. Its not complex as it could be, but simple too understand, but strong at its impact, and widely enjoyable to all age range.<br/><br/>Sometimes i searching and analyzing the formula that could made every pixar movie into an instant masterpiece. I come to conclusion that the main formula which pixar use is ""Reflection"". ""Giving a reflection of the past to adults audience"" (memorizing their child time) and ""Giving a reflection of the future to kids audience"" (teaching them to caring and loving). With this ""Reflection"" to its audience formula, pixar could easily control the memory and euphoria of its audiences life. By this formula, Pixar has high authority to control the emotion of its viewers. All hail to this studio maker, he/she have such a huge vision about the future of animation genre. Pixar is an audience life-changer and emotion-possessor. You should be careful to watch Pixar's movie or you will took its trap, crying like your childish time while you're an adults or maybe old aged."

","Before I started this movie I knew that it would be a psychologically well thought movie because it described the human mind so perfectly that it is right now used in Psychotherapy sessions. With that in mind I watched through the whole movie and the thought that was put into it was amazing. Everything happened for a reason. I would never say this is just a movie for kids. Yes kids will love it but many times the kids wont even comprehend the level of detail and thought that was put into the movie. The production is normal though, nothing special about the effects more then todays Animation movies but still an amazing script and an amazing story which actually is pretty simple but still gives a funny and a new look into a humans mind with a lot of comedy that both parents and kids will laugh at."
"willcundallreview","9","6","27","3 December 2015"," A fantastically crafted animations
","Pixar have created some of the best animations that can spring to many a persons mind, Inside Out is an addition that is just as excellent as you might hope it to be. The way in which this movie mixes not just fun but emotion and how we deal with it well it makes this much more profound and adds a lot of meaning. The movie basically is all about Riley, or to be way more specific inside Riley's head with all her emotions being little well, who knows actually, they are just emotions with bodies. Of course the movie isn't all just in Riley's head, we see Riley act out the emotions she feels and how it affects her new life as her and her family start a new life in San Francisco. The movie is crafted how animation should be with vivid colours and great detail, but add to that a sweet story in the middle and you have one absolutely fantastic little film.<br/><br/>After the hugely popular ""Up"" in 2009, Pete Docter directs and co- writes a Pixar animation yet again and does a very good job making this look absolutely beautiful. The animation is also in fantastic detail in regards to that this movie is all made up mostly architecture wise with it being majority within Riley's head which contains a mind HQ, A vast array of memories stored and thrown away and even a dream production company who decide what Riley will be dreaming about that night. The film is massive in its scale and yet set in such a small space really; the people behind this really have used imagination to an extent that this must be one of the best thought out animations ever. <br/><br/>With the emotions come voice cast like Amy Poehler (Joy), Phyllis Smith (Sadness), Bill Hader (Fear), Mindy Kaling (Disgust) and Lewis Black as Anger who really feels like he is about to swear at any moment he is on screen. The characters are fun but the voice cast are game too and really create a great sense of well character, I loved Poehler as Joy who is basically the main character of this movie but really all the little emotions and all the things living within Riley's mind are great fun and really well thought up. <br/><br/>The film has as said a meaning to it, more than just big jumps and rolls and a fun little adventure, sure it has that but it also deals with basically depression which then goes on to show that it can strike anyone of any age however happy they may seem to be. The film of course is no psychoanalysis studies piece but it is on the surface a film that breaks down barriers where really the main character is not always a happy one and does suffer. I really have to applaud the movie for exploring such things which really aren't what you might expect from an animated movie which is let's face it directed toward the kids in society but it does it in a way where anyone of any age can feel for the movie and also find it fantastic.<br/><br/>So Inside Out, an animated film that really is something a little special and something I found hard not to love just a little. It also I think can show that not all grown ups are ever fully out of there childhood, this is so fun it is hard not to watch it a little like being a child again and although the young one's will enjoy this, the adults should too. Pixar have yet again created something super fun and actually really important, hats off to the studio for really bringing something new to the animation game and showing that there is plenty of life left in Pixar."
"fabiolpinheiro1993","9","6","27","23 June 2015"," Not just an animated film, a film, that will hit you in the heart and mind.
","My favorite animated film of all time is The Incredibles, and i always expect something quite big from Pixar. Inside out may be alongside Brave one of the few films from Pixar that i wasn't all that excited, despite wanting to see it. But, once more Pixar delivered something big, really big.<br/><br/>The film like many of the late Pixar films, has a little complex narrative for children to really understand, but thats why Pixar films are so distinctive and big, because they shoot for the big themes, for the original ones, and this is another one. The narrative is smoothed by a lot of fun scenes, and is very completed, i feel like they started, developed and ended the narrative in a highly satisfying way.<br/><br/>The plot is always exciting, fun, very emotional and really makes you think about yourself. There's always something new and cool every few minutes, and there's never one second that the film starts to go down, is always up, up, up.It's very climatic, which makes the film very exciting.<br/><br/>The characters are beyond perfect, the score is another marvel, the colors and visuals are fresh, inventive, highly original and vibrant and the sound is just amazing.<br/><br/>This is a highly fresh, distinctive, original, resonant film, that rather than being just an animated film, is a film. And one you laugh, one you cry a lot, one which will hit you right in the heart and mind, one you can relate to, and will for sure. Its a film you will leave the theater speechless and very nostalgic. This i'm sure, will definitely be nominated for best picture at the Oscars. <br/><br/>I don't know why, the film is just perfect, and probably i will change my mind at some near point, but for now i will give it a 9, but its a very close to 10, 9."
"ofirharlev","10","7","34","19 February 2016"," A true epic masterpiece if I ever saw one
","Let me start by stating that IMO giving this (or any movie) a grade is totally unnecessary so I just gave it 10 to represent my overall content with this piece.<br/><br/>It seems to me as though Pixar (and DreamWorks) took it upon themselves(or maybe they were assigned by someone?) to educate the newer generations in such a way that even the parents sometimes would not even be aware of. I know, for a fact, that a lot of grown people do not fully get the deep sub-textual layer in this movie(which is not that sub-textual, quite frankly) but, beyond that, to think that a kid would totally get it is just preposterous. That said, there is no doubt in my mind that after witnessing this epoch, a kid would take the code of the events depicted in this movie for the remainder of his life, slowly but surely figuring out most of the elements that make up the human psyche....or not, that's also an option :P (not that I'm a professional on the human psyche, but I am indeed human(I think))<br/><br/>It's really evident that a ton of psychological work went into the script and IMO they did a masterful job that even Freud himself would've loved to see. As a movie, of course they had to turn to the old book of modern western movie making to get all the motifs and clichés in there, but by god, was it worth it. Just for the sake of narrative.<br/><br/>No need to state the obvious; the overall design and animation are top notch, the dubbing is amazing and the post production\folly and soundtrack are great.<br/><br/>If I had anything to do with it, this would be used as an educational movie.<br/><br/>Bravo, just..........standing ovation"

","This movie is great and Pixar deserve more than 10 for their great imagination; problem, not all the people understand, really, what the movie is about, so you will find a lot of bad reviews This movie is about the time when childhood ends and adolescence begins. This is a common problem for teachers in this transition time. The time when the child is to big to be a child and to child to be big. The time when all the imagination is lost and reality impacts to stay for ever. This problem, teacher know well, is marvelous treated in this movie from the inside world of the child from 5 basic emotions. It's shows how the child world collapses, in order to create a new world, the world that will be the adult world. Wonderful story from Pixar imagination that shows how the child is lost, and how the child joy has to learn to manage sadness in order to grow. Many times I ask myself when the ""child magic world ends"", this movie shows clearly how this happens. In my case was when I complete my primary school and starts the secondary studies. This movie works exactly with that time period, and use an external problem to trigger that process This is a movie to learn a lot about your child, and yourself, it is not an pure entertainment. That it is why you will found so many but reviews See this movie with your child mind in order to understand your adult mind"

If only all adults were not afraid to access, understand and appreciate their feelings rather than stuffing them down, the world would be a healthier place (search ""metaphysical reasons for illnesses"".<br/><br/>I would have loved to see a few more advanced emotions, rather than Joy handling it all, such as hope, safety and security (search ""list of feelings nvc""). It would also have been nice to show how the thoughts train actually generates our emotional state; however, I understand that it was a children's film. <br/><br/>Anyway, it was like having a basic map of how our feelings work in conjunction with each other, as well as with other parts of the mind (and heart)."
"calump-52337","10","7","34","9 August 2015"," An absolute masterpiece- Pixar's best flick since the Toy Story series
","*May contain spoilers* Pixar has done it again. After a few years of fluctuation in quality, Pixar has redefined what is possible in the art of animation. Inside Out, Pixar's 15th feature film, has combined the imagination the studio is renowned for, and a very real human quality- Emotion. Inside Out portrays an 11-year old girl, Riley Andersen(Kaitlyn Dias), along with her emotions, moving with her family from her home in Minneapolis, Minnesota to San Francisco. Riley's emotions, Joy(Amy Poehler), Sadness(Phyllis Smith), Disgust(Mindy Kaling), Anger(Lewis Black- A big fan already!) and Fear(Bill Hader) , keep Riley in check during these times using a console board that controls Riley. Sadness, seen as a nuisance usually by all the other emotions accidentally touches a memory contained in an orb, that was happy, turning it sad, and causing Riley to get upset in her new school. Chaos ensues as Joy tries to salvage Riley's core memories,each one powers a different aspect of her personality, and unfortunately, the core memories, along with Joy and Sadness, gets sucked out to the Long Term Memory.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the remaining emotions try to manage Riley in the absence of Joy and Sadness, causing her personality to gradually fail.<br/><br/>Joy and Sadness, lost in the Long Term Memory, meet Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's long forgotten imaginary friend. Bing Bong yearns to be remembered by Riley, and he agrees to direct the two emotions back to HeadQuarters, by riding the Train of Thought.<br/><br/>Not all goes to plan, after traversing through Disneyland-like areas of Riley's mind, they eventually catch the train, however, the track collapses when one of Riley's personality islands disintegrates, which results in Joy and Bing Bong falling into the memory dump, a limbo of forgotten memories.She comes across a memory, which depicts a sad Riley seeking comfort from her parents after losing a game of hockey. She realises Sadness' true purpose- To alert others when Riley needs a helping hand. Joy finds Bing Bong's song-powered rocket, and she eventually finds her way back to HeadQuarters with Sadness, only to find that the other emotions instilled the idea to run away to Minnesota to restore happy core memories. All of her personality islands have collapsed and the console had locked up, rendering Riley apathetic.<br/><br/>Sadness is the only one who can remove the idea, and she takes control of the console, restoring control and causing Riley to return to her parents.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside Out is one of the finest pictures to come out of Pixar, It will make you laugh, it will jerk tears even from the toughest of folk, it has a rock-solid storyline and a realistic, but charming animation style- using particles rather that skin-and-bone 3D animation for the emotions and a cold, steely look for San Francisco. It conveys its message in an ingenious, fun and a very relatable way. Inside Out may be classed as family film, but there is a lot of quite complex concepts such as depression, apathy, personality, running away, and memory, things that young kids simply can't understand, however, this film will please adults, teenagers and Pixar fans alike. This is definitely a film worthy to be called an instant classic and I guarantee that this film will make you think, and question ""What is going on inside their head?""<br/><br/>*"

"brianalanbradshaw","9","6","28","9 August 2015"," An enjoyable, emotional family film.
","The first thing I can say about Inside Out, is it isn't a kids film - it is a film for all the family. I say this in response to people that day it is hard for kids to follow which, in retrospect, is true. But they don't need to follow the plot line to enjoy it. But I digress.<br/><br/>I took my 4-year-old niece to see the film this afternoon and I found for adults and teenagers, there is a dark, emotional story that can resonate to us. It reminds us of how we were growing up; how we reacted in certain situations and how we resolved them. It also reminds us that we all have voices inside our heads that can manipulate our reactions, and we should embrace them (this doesn't mean we are crazy, it's normal).<br/><br/>For my niece, sure enough, the story was hard for her to grasp, but she didn't need to. There was enough laugh out loud moments for the both of us and she had a blast. She - and kids nearby - didn't spend the whole movie asking questions. They just laughed their way through the film.<br/><br/>The only concern about the film was the *SPOILER* one reference of puberty, but it was a joke for the older people to understand and my niece didn't ask what it meant. If she did, I am smart enough to skip around explaining and so should be all adults.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a healthy balance of great, comedy for children and adults, with a bittersweet story anyone that has gone through the pains of maturity to relate to. A must watch for all the family."

I can't really give examples to say what exactly about it makes it so brilliant (not without giving spoilers anyway) but I highly recommend giving it a try before judging it...even if you are older. my nieces loved it too and they learned a lot from it. I myself was laughing almost constantly and I really hope they try for a sequel cause there is so much potential to a perspective like this...I will never think of the inside of my head the same way again :P I apologise if I have given any spoilers but I don't think I have said anything the trailer doesn't reveal."

","Sometimes there comes along an excellent, well made, and masterful film that everybody loves, but, for some weird reason, all of the most popular user reviews are negative. Now, I don't mind people expressing their honest opinion, but I don't get some of the user reviews that have been posted, and I ESPECIALLY don't get why there's so many people giving it a 1/10! Sure, you can hate the movie, TOTALLY fine, but a 1/10 star rating is totally unnecessary when you have a film with such lovely animation, and so much hard work and effort clearly put into it! It really bothers me when I go through some of these reviews because I know that animation and filmmaking are extremely hard, and this isn't some lazily animated, 50 minute rip off of ""Kung Fu Panda"" (I'm looking at you, ""The Little Panda Fighter""), this is a pretty well made film. I guess this just proves that opinions are truly powerful things, but, anyway, what about the actual movie!<br/><br/>I already said before, it is an extremely well put together animated film, full of great details and the amount of hard work and effort that was clearly put into this production is absolutely amazing! Even if you weren't 100% into the story, characters, etc., it's very well made, at least, just like any other Pixar or Disney animated film.<br/><br/>While the concept of seeing the inside of a character's head and watching their emotions react to various things is nothing new and can be seen in various TV shows, movies, etc. (There's even an entire sitcom based around the idea called ""Herman's Head""), this film really expands upon the concept and looks at some of the tiniest details in a really clever and witty way. For example, there's one scene in which we are briefly introduced to two characters whose jobs are to take certain, unimportant memories and make the brain forget about them forever. That is only one example out of many examples of true cleverness behind ""Inside Out"".<br/><br/>And the film isn't just fun and games, it has a truly emotional and surprisingly mature side to it that's likely to make plenty of viewers cry. Trust me, ""Inside Out"" goes to some really dark and borderline depressing places!<br/><br/>This truly is a masterpiece."

","I understand that some people may find this film to be quite dark and 'not for the kids', but I think what people fail to understand is that, despite it being animated, this isn't technically a kids film. What I find it to be is a cinematic masterpiece, reaching new highs in Pixar animation and doing it so well. It made me feel sad, happy and pretty much every emotion in between. What I also love about this film is that it's one of the first modern animated films to really dig below the surface of how it feels to face difficult mental states, such as depression, which many people, including myself, can really relate to. Fantastic film, would definitely recommend at least a watch!"

","i am a huge Disney and Pixar fan no matter what but i have to say i was nervous about this one. i thought the idea was very cool but i had no idea how they were gonna pull it off, i just couldn't think of anything that could happen to make a full length and adventurous movie about an 11 year old's brain. But they pulled it off and it was amazing! i loved joy, and bing bong. this was a perfect addition to the Pixar collection. this movie made me laugh and cry and really think about psychology. what i thought was extremely interesting about this movie is when they're sitting at the table (it was in the previews for it) and at the end during the credits, that when they went into other peoples heads, they had different emotions in charge, for example the mom had sadness in charge, Riley has joy in charge and her father had anger in charge. it made me really think about what my leader would be. another thing i loved were the personality islands and i really wish i could see everyone that i knew! all I'm saying is this movie is very fun, accurate, lovable and probably my second favorite Pixar movie, replacing finding Nemo and following my first favorite monsters inc."

Boy, was I surprised!<br/><br/>Inside Out was a poignant and touching story, and the movie had layers upon layers of lessons and meaning carefully and masterfully crafted into witty dialogue. There were no gratuitous musical numbers, no endless comedic sequences that make you giggle but don't progress the story, and yet the movie was well-paced, well-written, and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.<br/><br/>This story truly had something for everyone - the kids in the theater all giggled, the adults sniffled and sighed, and I can think of quite a few former teachers of mine who would have gleefully screened this movie to provide fodder for debate for weeks worth of lessons. Most importantly to me, all of the members of our family left the theater raving about what we had just seen- that never happens... ever.

The voice actors and actresses all played their emotion very well, and Anger was easily the funniest in my opinion.

Also, it is one of the few films with better end credits than the actual film. <br/><br/>All of my friends went to see it before me and I'm never letting this happen again. I had to endure a hundred ""You're gonna love it! It's amazing!"". Consequentially, I walked into the cinema full of positive expectations, hoping that I will watch an intelligently made film. <br/><br/>I was partially right. However, if there's anything that annoys me more than a bad film is half a bad film. Was it so hard to finish the work the way you started it? <br/><br/>What I expected: A fun elaborate animation about emotions and the brain.<br/><br/>What I got: A cliché animation with flat annoying characters. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really liked how they showed the relationships between the different parts of the brain. They managed to include core memories and to show that memories are fragile and can be changed depending on your emotional state. This was pure gold, loved it. I don't think I've ever seen this represented in a film before. <br/><br/>BUT all the characters were very one-sided and unoriginal. The hardworking dad and the typical mom. I was hoping to see what goes on in their heads and to compare it with the brain of the little one. However, this happened only once and we'd already seen it in the trailer. I wanted complexity which is probably a lot to ask from a Pixar animation but in my defense they have done it before. <br/><br/>Joy was very annoying in the beginning. Sadness and the imaginary friend of the girl were the only characters who made me feel something. The little girl seemed a bit too perfect for my taste. <br/><br/>As an adult who has seen numerous animations, I don't think Inside Out is anything special.

Narrated from the emotional side of 'emotions' inside an eleven year old's head, the plot has many carefully planted moments of tension where your heart would definitely skip a beat. Be it falling bridges or endless pits your are sure to let out a gasp and feel for them, feelings. Parents are likely to get hit the hardest, I would suggest you bring some tissues. Like Toy Story its a story about leaving your childhood behind. Inside out manages the delicate feat of being worldly wise without sacrificing your sense of innocence. Riley may be on the cusp of adolescence but the button of Puberty is never pressed. This makes it even more interesting as we are left to think, if emotions could cause so much stir in children, then what about teens? Think about all the mood swings they go through!<br/><br/>What hasn't changed in all the family movies is the notion that 'there is no place like home'. This notion is played with differently in different movies. For Riley and her emotions it is togetherness, if you with your mum and dad then you can keep world at a bay. <br/><br/>Although most of the content is appropriate for elementary schoolers and up, younger kids may need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are references to abstract thought and the subconscious, and it can be a little confusing when other characters' emotions are shown.<br/><br/>Overall the level of invention is so high, and the density of detail is so great, that it's impossible to absorb everything in a single viewing. Kids and their parents, psychologists and philosophers alike, are all bound to be awed by Pixar's latest and boldest feature yet. It is the universality of the film that makes it an instant classic.<br/><br/>Let me sum it up like this, how do you make a movie good? Just take something inanimate, give it some feelings, some emotion and a dash of dealings with the unconscious, the spectrum of Freud, voilà you are now watching one of Pixar's masterpieces. Push it bit further and give the emotion itself an emotion, think about how feelings would feel and you end up with an all time best, Inside out."

","I did expect a lot from this movie after seeing the trailer and the ratings it received. And I did not get disappointed! The basic plot of this movie is one of Pixar's greatest (together with Toy Story). It's creative, clever, and really, really funny. I do think this is Pixar's most sophisticated movie, as there weren't as much slapstick as usual, and there were a lot of jokes that I found hilarious that didn't generate much laughter from the children in the theater. The smaller children probably won't understand much of what's going on in the movie, but maybe they'll enjoy it anyway.<br/><br/>PS: I'm really strict with my ratings, so 8 means that it's a really good movie."
"joncheskin","9","6","29","2 August 2015"," Awesome for Both 6 year olds and grad students
","Inside Out is a rather unique viewing experience of the type that you can only get from Pixar. Most of the action takes place inside the brain of 11-year-old Riley, where her five basic emotions-- Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust-- are turned into cartoon characters that cooperate to help run her conscious and unconscious mind. The control room where they operate is thrown into turmoil when Riley's father gets a new job that forces the family to move from Minnesota to San Francisco. When Riley becomes isolated from her familiar core memories, her whole personality structure is threatened in ways that are brilliantly personified by the world of Pixar animation.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about this movie is that it operates equally effectively if you are a 6-year-old viewer or if you are a grad student in psychology. The five emotions are dazzling characters in themselves, and provide a bunch of laughs for any kid (including mine, who persuaded me to go see it after he first saw it with his grandma). I have seen many negative reviews claiming that the movie is too abstract for young kids, but this was not my experience--although my son was definitely not up on all of the heady psychology that the movie explores, he was still able to be completely enthralled by the emotions as characters as in a traditional cartoon. I think that some people simply cannot believe that a movie that is so intellectual can be understood by kids of this age, but the fact is that it can.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in some measure this movie is like a graduate seminar in psychology as if taught by a 6-year-old. We get to take a trip to various personality islands, aspects of Riley's personality that arise out of her core memories, we get also a journey in the subconscious (where the troublemakers are sent!), we ride on a train of thought which is actually a train, and we get lost in a maze of long term memories. And then we get to see how the various emotions compete and cooperate to serve the psyche as a whole. This is an absolutely dazzling psychology lesson at what seemed to me to be a rather high level.<br/><br/>It should be said that this idea of a control room for a psyche has been done before--you can even point to a comical version in Woody Allen's Sleeper, for instance. What is new here is that it is done with such amazing intellectual sophistication, animation, and truly awesome childlike fun all at the same time. Also, watching Riley's battle to adjust to her new home, which is becomes very traumatic for her, is no joke and becomes the basis of an increasingly powerful story. The result is an incredible movie that takes the idea of simultaneous entertainment for all ages to a new and dazzling level."
"deeempty","5","6","29","2 August 2015"," No surprise here
","This movie is over-rated: its too family-love-ish for people like me from messed-up families, and gets all yukky-soppy at too many points. Probably a great movie for middle-class kids on the verge of adolescence who have just moved somewhere new, otherwise I can't see how this would appeal to many other types of people (unless they are parents watching with their kids). But what spoilt it most of all for me is that there was no surprise - literally. The six basic emotions in psychology include surprise as well as the five represented here (happiness/joy, sadness, anger, fear and disgust). Without surprise, the poor girl in the movie can never be amazed, and will probably find it hard to 'get' most jokes if she can't feel surprised. Major plot-hole."
"idoyam","7","6","29","1 August 2015"," Almost Perfect - 9.2
","Inside Out takes place into Riley's emotions and show us what happens inside your head when you have sort of crisis. Or in this case - moving to a new city.<br/><br/>On the one hand,the movie has a lot of tiny problems that ruins the chance to give it a 10. For example, there were few times that i was bored or already know what is coming next. And I wasn't the only one. Also my cousins who are much younger than me felt like this. This shouldn't happen if the movie's goal is to be perfect!<br/><br/>Another great example is that in my opinion they didn't focus enough about the emotions and how they function in a different situation-before Riley moved to a new city and the twist started. I wanted to see a lot more about Riley's life and friends.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this film is fantastic by many aspects, the movie built a new interesting world that i was very curios and interested to learn about.Also,the movie succeed to make the audiences feel connected to the characters and off-course almost all of the movie had an interesting plot.<br/><br/>In conclusion,the movie has a few little problems that ruins the chance to give it a 10 But also a lot of amazement,funny and sophisticated scenes that you suddenly almost forget about the issues that you had with the movie."
"JankiSharma","10","6","29","27 June 2015"," emotions talk
","Inside out ... terrific movie , written very well, excellent Direction and I thoroughly enjoyed how human emotions talk to each other and suppress all except one. And when that does not happen, there is chaos. Humans have Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Disgust and if not in tune with the inside, disaster strikes. The choice of voices is funny... Mindy Kaling( from The Office) for Disgust, Bill Hader( from Identical Twins) for Fear , Phyllis Smith( again from The Oficce) for sadness(my favorite) and Amy Poehler for Joy( terrific) & Lewis Black for Anger (liked him in Accepted) did a great job. With movies like Inside out and Frozen, adults will have a chance to relearn how to make sadness stay inside and let joy take over. And also love will stay blossomed among siblings even if outside love becomes available. Inside Out is definitely Oscar worthy for Direction, Writing, Editing and Sound Department. loved it."
"hjk-00653","9","6","29","26 June 2015"," Inside Out was great
","The movie was fantastically imaginative, incredibly original, well written, designed with precision detail and even emotional at times. I loved it. It will make you want to give your kid a long bear-hug. I would nominate it for an Academy Award if anyone cared what I had to say. It was a great family movie. Pete Doctor once again did what he does best- which is to say that he does family animated movies that everyone has a good time with. I'm not the overly-talkative type when it comes to typing out a review, but when I click on ""Preview"", it's telling me that I don't have enough lines of text.

","""Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life."" Samuel Ullman <br/><br/>While the emotions of a pre-adolescent girl, Riley (voice of Kaitlyn Dias), in Inside Out are depicted in a Star-Trek like control room as real characters, Joy (Amy Poehler) is the Captain Kirk, the major influence in Riley's life so far and at the helm with other players Fear, Sadness, Disgust, and a plethora of memory pods. Riley's had a happy Minnesota life so far with ice hockey and hiking and a much simpler life than now faces her in the family's move to San Francisco.<br/><br/>The depiction of these raucous emotions is sheer Pixar genius, a human menagerie of inner players, making sense of the conflicting feelings of a young person, and all of us for that matter. The visuals are stunning, as colorful as has been seen in any other animation, and the big-eyed 'toon characters have distinct personalities developed in a short time.<br/><br/>Besides the anthropomorphic emoticons, I am most impressed by the emphasis on memory in fashioning a life. My fear is losing that great gift, for memories form the core of satisfaction with my life, a hedge against mortality if you will. Inside Out emphasizes the primacy of those memories while it also frames the inside fight around the necessity for the conflicting emotions, even sadness as a major player in mental health.<br/><br/>Well, it is Pixar after all with its brilliant combination of fun and intelligence, a work of art that indulges the physical and cerebral. All this in an animation—who would have thought except that Saturday cartoons at my local theater helped me shape a loving attitude toward cinema and a career in film criticism? That's my Joy."
"bardia-moose","9","6","29","20 June 2015"," Welcome Back, Pixar
","INSIDE OUT (2015) centers on an eleven year-old girl named Riley and the emotions that run around inside her head.<br/><br/>The thing with Hollywood these days is that a lot of the same ideas are recycled over and over again; the overwhelming number of sequels, prequels, remakes, and reboots all leave very little room for originality. And when something original comes by, not many people go see it. If only there was a studio that specialized in innovative storytelling and was capable of pulling in a large audience. If only.<br/><br/>Monsters University and Brave weren't bad, they just weren't at the level we expect from Pixar. And with Cars 2 being a real stinker, the studio seemed like it was starting to lose steam. Does INSIDE OUT end the cold streak or does Pixar, the king of animation, finally get dethroned? Sit tight everyone; the king ain't going anywhere anytime soon.<br/><br/>INSIDE OUT is colorfully vibrant, wonderfully voice-acted, thought provoking and emotionally resonant; it's a film kids will love for the world created, but one that adults will appreciate even more for a surprisingly mature and fascinating look at growing up.<br/><br/>But what impressed me the most about INSIDE OUT is how it gets into the psyche of not only what it's like going growing up, but tackling the fear of what could happen, the disgust at what you don't understand, the anger when things don't go as planned, the sadness when you're in the worst situation, and the joy when you realize that what happens ultimately happens for a reason, and life continues to go on despite it.<br/><br/>If I had one gripe, though, it would be that the film focuses a little too much on the journey inside her head, rather than show a little more of Riley from the outside. The scenes where we travel inside her head and back out were some of the best in the movie, and I would've liked to see more of that inside and outside contrast.<br/><br/>All I can say is thank you Pixar, thank you for staying original and, yet again, capturing the hearts of all of those who dare to dream, all those who fight to preserve what little imagination is left inside."
"subxerogravity","9","6","29","20 June 2015"," Nothing but the best from Pixar.
","There is some well done animation going here that's going to make inside out an instant classic among classics like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles. It was so well crafted this time around, the movement of the 3D images were better than anything I've seen before. It's very colorful (like a child's mind), and the animation give off a scene of action adventure in the movement, very exciting to watch. <br/><br/>The story in the animation was well written and showed the importance of all sets of emotions to a healthy growing mind. The movie is about young girl Riley's emotions working together to keep the kid sound during a big change in her life. Someone really did their homework on how the mind works and was able to interpret that to a wide core audience with silly little things like A train that carries your thoughts and a Hollywood studio that produces your dreams and the biggest star of the studio was named Rainbow haired unicorn. <br/><br/>The whole thing felt like reading a really good children's book about the effects of a small child moving from the only home she's every known to a new environment. It was so well played out you can't help to cheer. <br/><br/>Joy was the main protagonist of the film, but sadness steels the show with her dead pan humor. Fear and anger are two other notable emotions in the film. <br/><br/>They also had a short film in the beginning called lava which was really amazing and touching.<br/><br/>Absolutely perfect!"

This truly epic journey through time, childhood, the midwest and California and into the bonds that bind us as families as well as subjective beings to our imaginary universes is part philosophical questioning, part emotive storytelling and all incredible cinema. <br/><br/>Having seen this at a press screening at Pixar, i can attest that this is a film unlike any other - spectacular in its range and ambition and meticulously rendered into beautiful frames via an unforgettable narrative. It will likely change the way you think about the reality you inhabit your own head, and the way you travel through time as a child, parent or cat.<br/><br/>I left the screening almost in tears - struck dumb and a little altered by the way in which the moving image can create such lasting, resonant memories in the mind of the cinema goer."
"mark-908-122018","8","3","11","4 March 2018"," Surprised by the 1 star reviews
","I've read a lot of angry reviews that trash the movie, and I frankly don't understand the vitriol. This is no 1-star movie and even if it is not the most amazing thing Pixar has ever produced, I found it very entertaining. As with all Pixar productions, the visuals are lush, fun, and detailed, and the voice acting is great. Lewis Black as Anger was a genius casting move and his character quickly became my favorite.<br/><br/>Perhaps part of the reason there are negative reviews is because people are not considering the target audience - which is kids, not adults. Giving emotions relatable, uncomplicated characters is not a sin. There is a subtle subplot going on in this movie where the emotions are learning to live and work with each other - in a sense, growing up just like the main character. Joy isn't able to relate to Sadness, for example. But can they learn to get along and benefit from each others' talent? Watch and find out. Other plot bits deal with how memory, thinking, and imagination work in a context that's accessible even to my (now) 7 year old. She and I even used the emotion characters to help express her inner feelings that she might not always have words for. <br/><br/>Don't be put off by the negative reviews. If you like Pixar's work, you'll like this too. You might even love it, but I can't see wanting the time you spent watching it back as some people seem to feel. I've watched it three times with my kids on family movie nights, and I'm still touched by it every time."
"TheOny13","8","2","6","28 December 2018"," I really wanted this to be a masterpiece!
","Let me start by saying that I've seen many bad reviews for this film and some good ones trying to combat those bad ones. I tried to keep an open mind and not let myself influenced by any of them and make my own opinion. So here it is:<br/><br/>First of this movie starts strong and I got me from the first second although I mainly knew what it was about.The concept was very interesting executed although it was way too oversimplified, but hey... it's a kid's movie, would talk about how feelings develop or manifest in science terms? You must make these ideas interesting, captivating and palpable for children and props to the movie for doing that. But after that the movie lost it's tempo for me unfortunately. It got actually unnecessary complicated. It was like this scene here, this scene there could be pulled out of the movie, and the movie wouldn't have suffered for it. I'll enter some spoilers territory here so for those who haven't seen the movie skip this part. ***SPOILERS: When Joy finds herself with sadness along the crest of that cliff and sees that she needs to get back, she realizes that she can't go along the edge of it because there wasn't enough space. But later on when the clock was ticking suddenly there was space between the long-term memories and the edge of the cliff just so that joy could reach the place she wanted to go. That is just lazy writing and some inconsistency. Next, at the beginning of her journey back to the tower joy sees the islands crashing very fast, but later on when the movie is ending and she\s running out of time, the last island (which was family island and a bigger one though) it crashes so slowly that again screams laziness in writing a cohesive story that is constant from start to finish and doesn't contradicts itself on the way. Next when joy tries to reach the train she makes and unnecessary detour with Bing bong that is just there to offer some character development to a character that I didn't need investing in. By the end Bing bong starts to disappear like one hand in 10 or 15 minutes of screen time but at the end when he sacrifices himself to help joy get back on the cliff he instantly disappears in an instant, again inconsistency... END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Apart from that the story was beautiful with some very touching moments that almost made me cry and very mature (but not too mature as some people said here) themes for both children and adults alike. The humor... some of the best humor in a animated movie ever put to screen, and that surely elevated this movie in my opinion. The score was again extremely well don by Michael Giacchino, although not one of his best or better ones.<br/><br/>All in all a good movie with some great moments in it but at the same time with severe incoherence problems that unfortunately for me didn't work as a masterpiece (like it was praised by critics) like for example ""Coco"" or ""Zootopia"" or ""Wall-E"". 8/10"

","I thought no Pixar movie would beat it's first- Toy Story. It took 2 full decades of film making but they did it- with Inside Out. <br/><br/>I saw this 11 months ago when I was at a tech school for a month. It was my first time away from home and I was very emotional. Many movies I saw helped me for a short while, but none of them did that more than this.<br/><br/>Our main character, Riley, has 5 emotions in her head: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and most importantly, Sadness. They all struggle with each other when Riley has to move away to a new home.<br/><br/>I am surprised to see 57 current reviews giving this 1 star. Many claim it's boring. Compared to what? Most kid movies are silly-take that Emoji Movie that came out. I did not see it, but it looked pretty dumb and worthless.<br/><br/>Some have said that it's too complex. Perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier, but this may be best for older audiences, like The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's a movie that older audiences can connect with more. This isn't exactly for toddlers, but grade schoolers and up should see this.<br/><br/>I cannot think of another Pixar film I would want to give more in-depth praise to. I would love to see more animated features like this. Our society needs it.<br/><br/>Inside Out is not just a great animated movie but one of the best movies I have seen in recent years.

"bob the moo","Null","5","23","18 December 2015"," Smart, insightful, moving, and fun
","By the time I finally got to see this film, I had already heard lots of praise for it, lots of talking head mulling over whether it has a shot at Best Picture (not just animated), and lots of other things that told me this was supposed to be a great film. Of course, even without this, the film still has the weight of other great Pixar movies down the years, so it already has a high bar to clear even without the additional hype. Watching it for myself though I was surprised by how little I thought of such things, and how totally I just enjoyed the film on its own terms. Ironically, I did this because of how accurate all the positive reviews and buzz were, because Inside Out is a really great film.<br/><br/>Constructed on a reality which all parents of older children will no doubt connect to, the film takes the emotional change of a girl into a young teenager and puts it into a comedic adventure story set inside her head. The world inside her head is not only engaging, but incredibly smart – how accurate it is to the real world of psychology (if those words fit together) I do not know, but it is impressively constructed and also designed to make sense, be accessible, and also create a world for colorful characters to delight on an adventure level while also carrying the emotional punch to deliver a much bigger story (although also a very personal one too). It is as moving as it is funny, and as insightful and as it fun, and it is impressive how it is all put together. The animation is topnotch as ever, and the voice cast are not just famous names but well cast famous names who fit their characters well – with Poehler being a strong lead, while Smith, Black, Kaling, and Hader all doing great work (along with many other supporting characters – not least of which being Dias as Riley herself).<br/><br/>I doubt voters would be able to bring themselves to vote for it to win Best Picture while being 'just a cartoon' but at the same time it is hard to imagine that 2015 will produce a better, smarter, and more effective film."

","I think this movie is not only for kids, it has the complexity of a very narrative movie, and also it makes you think about a lot of stuff. All those brain functions are so elaborate. My preferred character is Anger played by Lewis Black. Watch this movie guys, if you are 14 or 80 years old you will like it."
"Animated_Antic","10","4","17","13 June 2017"," A very creative and fun movie.
","Here's a movie that has the creativity and genius of a movie that animated movies have lacked for years. Considering that some animation studios (notably DreamWorks) have been struggling to try to get an original idea for years, ""Inside Out"" shows that Pixar still has the magic that made their previous movie classics. This movie is one of the best animated movies in years and is the very definition of an instant classic. It will be remembered years into the future. I haven't seen a film this creative and imaginative in a long, long time and I loved every single minute of it.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the personalized emotions of a girl named Riley. Each one of them has a specific color and personality to make them unique. They also have distinct voices. Joy is played by Amy Poehler, Sadness by Phyllis Smith, Fear by Bill Hader, Disgust by Mindy Kaling, and Anger by Lewis Black. They live at the center of Riley's head called headquarters and control her personality. All the emotions get along with each other except Joy and Sadness. Joy doesn't want Sadness controlling Riley as she wants Riley to have a happy life along with the fact that when she touches a memory which is basically encased in a sphere, it becomes sad. One day though, Riley's life is turned upside down when her parents decide to move away from her home in Minnesota to an unpleasant house in San Fransisco.  Joy tries to control Riley enjoy the move, but Sadness gets in the way and makes a large impact that I dare not spoil. Through a series of mishaps, Joy and Sadness are transported far away from the headquarters to another area of the memory and they need to get back to headquarters as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The story is one of the most creative stories I've seen not just in an animated movie, but in a movie in general. The ideas that are in this movie are so ingenious as it shows us the working of certain areas of the mind and makes them so unique and memorable. It has so many hilarious and emotional moments that it reminded me a lot of ""Up"" which wasn't a surprise as both of these films were directed by the same director. The characters are also a lot of fun. Amy Poehler is great as she always is as Joy and another stand out was Lewis Black as Anger who was pretty hilarious in this movie. The animation is also breathtaking. It's bright and colorful and has many details that make it stand out. For example, the emotions really have shiny details to them which reminded me a lot of colored sugar. I also enjoyed how bouncy and fun Riley's head was compared to the dull dreary real world. That balance is what I expect to see in animated movie and I love that they included it.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" is not only the best animated movie of 2015, it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I have not seen a film this likable and creative in a while and I'm so glad that this film is another standout from the incredible Pixar. It's such a breathtaking film that you must have to see it for yourselves. It truly is a wonderful experience."
"tomgillespie2002","10","6","30","17 November 2015"," The closest Pixar have come to pure perfection
","A film will come along perhaps once every few years that has a profound effect on me to the point that I view the world slightly differently than I did before. Inside Out - the majestic and extremely moving latest effort from Pixar - is one of those films. Pixar's back catalogue is a stellar line-up of classics, with even the lesser titles having something going for them, but I believe Inside Out is there finest to date. It's a brave, emotionally complex story that will likely leave some children depressed and adults even more so, but this is mature film-making of the very highest order.<br/><br/>A girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is born into the world, and her mind instantly starts to develop her core emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) is first to arrive and forms an instant bond with Riley. Soon enough, she is joined by Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), as Riley's personality begins to develop. Joy rules the roost during Riley's happy childhood, but as the years go by and Riley moves to a new city, the other emotions start to influence her actions. After a minor breakdown in front of her new classmates, Riley struggles to adapt to the changes, and Joy and Sadness find themselves whisked off into the deepest regions of her mind while the others struggle to steady the ship.<br/><br/>Pixar have never lacked visual imagination (they are the great innovators of computer animation after all), and they have worked overtime with Inside Out. What begins as a playful portal into the mind of an immature girl, the setting becomes more layered as she grows. Branches stretch out to reveal various aspects of Riley's personality, core memories are collected and stored in glowing spheres, and there is a literal train of thought that runs throughout the mind. The creativity is truly let off the leash when Joy and Sadness get caught up in the abstract thought region, and find themselves quickly morphing from a Picasso-esque form to two dimensional to nothing more than a straight line. The fearlessness of which directors Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen approach the subject matter is one of the many endearing things about Inside Out.<br/><br/>Along Joy and Sadness's journey, they encounter Bing Bong (Richard Kind), a ridiculous amalgamation of cat, elephant and dolphin with a candy-floss torso, who turns out to be Riley's childhood imaginary friend. As she has matured, Bing Bong has slowly been forgotten, and spends his time watching old memories. Providing welcome comic relief as well as providing an insight into a more innocent and care-free time of Riley's life, Bing Bong may just be Pixar's most ingenious creation. Well aware that his time may soon be up as he is forgotten completely, he selflessly aids Joy and Sadness (as well as hindering their progress with his constant bumbling). He is an immensely lovable but ultimately tragic character, and Pixar gracefully avoids intensely pulling the heart-strings in favour of something more emotionally honest, achieving a harder gut-punch in the process.<br/><br/>If you go in expecting a cuddly family movie then you may be disappointed. The opening third is more interested in developing its vast, intricate world and developing the bond between the host and her emotions than delivering prat-falls and goofy voices. The human brain is a wonderful, fascinating place, and Inside Out revels in exploring its endless possibilities. It also teaches a thing or two about how we work by lumping Joy and Sadness together, two complete opposites of the same spectrum who could not exist without the other. Children's movies have always leaned towards pure escapism, a world in which true horror is either non-existent or easily defeated, but Inside Out shows us that its normal, healthy, and ultimately inevitable, to experience sadness. I don't like to throw the term 'masterpiece' around, but this is the closest Pixar have come to pure perfection."
"~AleXa~","8","6","30","6 September 2015"," A fresh and provocative look at how our emotions affect our daily lives
","Inside Out (2015) Reviewed August 15th, 2015 after 1st viewing (Theatrical 2D) Disney / Pixar - Directed by: Pete Docter<br/><br/>A fresh and provocative look at how our emotions affect our daily lives<br/><br/>I will admit that while I was hesitant to see this due to the unimpressive trailer, I was pleasantly surprised that it was deeper than I expected.<br/><br/>Pete Docter succeeds in drawing you in from the beginning, introducing the characters as they are introduced to Riley as an infant. It was thoroughly engrossing to learn of the core personality elements and the artistic way they were visualized conceptually, making for a thrilling watch. There are of course some flaws here, namely that I feel the dissolution of her core personality traits happened altogether too fast, not to mention I don't ascribe to the belief that these core elements can be lost altogether, but I'll digress here. And, I love that she was a girl who enjoyed hockey—well done on that point Disney.<br/><br/>I found the incorporation of her long-lost imaginary friend to be a welcome surprise. As we journey deeper into her mind, the film takes an underwhelming turn, making it wholly unbelievable each of the islands would be collapsing so quickly, and that they'd be so difficult to get to, as if the writers weren't sure how to sustain the second act. I found myself a little displaced here, quickly losing interest as it seemed a bit too predictable. I do feel as though they did not do the other emotions justice, speaking from personal experience that learning to appropriately deal with anger and fear and just as important.<br/><br/>The third act picked up considerably; I enjoyed the void of forgotten memories, the wagon, and the weight of the decision that Bing Bong has to make. I also thoroughly enjoyed the exploration of the purpose of sadness, teaching kids and adults alike that not only is it okay to be sad, but that it can be therapeutic and allow new bridges to be built and bonds to be made.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it enjoyable with an important message, but I can't help but feel they could have explored personality more, and the differences between each individual as opposed to a quick montage at the end that did incorporate some stereotypical elements. It is a tad frustrating that I was left feeling like some material was intentionally not covered to leave room for a sequel, detracting from my overall enjoyment.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: While I appreciate the originality and boldness of the idea behind the film, I do think they could've explored other traits and the other emotions a bit more. Not to mention that now that I've heard the message, there is little rewatch value here. Ironically, it is lacking any memorable moments in deference to the subject matter. I appreciated the concept more than enjoyed the film itself, but I do greatly respect the effort that went into presenting such provocative material in a way children can understand and relate to.<br/><br/>7.5 of 10.0<br/><br/>NOTE: The short ""Lava"" at the beginning of the film was AMAZING—I actually felt the weight and emotion of that more than most of the film—I was crying a minute and a half into the short."

","...it's just a matter of who is at the controls and who is ""playing"" with each other, thinking of the matter it is interesting to notice that if you think back to your younger times are most of the feelings one-sided or when did it shift to be the good with the bad, the happy and sad, the playful and scary.<br/><br/>This is a really good story, there are some great observations about mood and feelings and thought and genders and much much more. We all have different feelings in us and we all know that sometimes we can't control them, sometimes we are sad for no apparent reason, sometimes e just think of something nice. This film makes sense of a lot of things and put things in perspective, gives both children and adults something to think about and ponder if that is how it is, how we remember things, it did for me anyway.<br/><br/>This film has something new, not that Pixars stories haven't had feelings before, they all have, but this is a very ""real"" animation, a story that could have been made as an ordinary film, but that in this universe can say a lot of things you wouldn't be able to in a film with real actors. This film gave me much more then the usual funny moments meant for the adults, this was mind boggling, funny, adventures, strange and emotional, my kids saw a whole different movie in many aspects, but they also felt the feelings involved and even my six year old (almost seven) said stuff about the movie that I didn't think she would understand, we all had a great time with this animation.<br/><br/>Some memories fade away and some linger with us for a long long time, are they all there or do we have to push things aside for the ""important"" memories, do we have to expand some areas of the mind, destroy some to make room for others, all great things that we can think about and have in perspective after watching this film.<br/><br/>They do open up for a whole new story, I guess when Puberty arrive, we will see a lot more of anger and we will see happy have to deal with a lot of new scenarios :)"

I am 15 years old and I thought that this was a wonderful movie. Disgust is my favorite emotion! I love how each of the emotions were portrayed and I thought that all of the actors did a wonderful job playing the different characters. I thought that the parents' emotions were all funny. I thought that the movie had a great lesson in it for children. When it comes out on regular TV, I will probably end up watching this movie again.

","This is a great family film overall. It is smart, inventive, fun, emotional, and quite clever.<br/><br/>The storyline is very creative and original. It takes the viewer inside a person's mind and features emotions in the shape of characters. It also explores a whole world inside the mind featuring memories, dreams, and imagination. This is quite possibly Pixar's most original idea since Toy Story.<br/><br/>The characters are likable and entertaining. We have the four emotions, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear who operate the feelings of a young girl named Riley as she and her mom and dad have moved to a new home. You care for Riley as things go wrong in the world inside her mind. You also care for the emotions as Joy and Sadness set out on a quest to set things right while Anger, Disgust and Fear are left on their own, and you want the emotions to succeed. My favorite character is Anger.<br/><br/>Pete Docter did a great job directing. It has gorgeous and colorful animation and unique and stylish designs.<br/><br/>It is also very funny at times. This is one of those where the humor actually works and I laughed more than I usually do at he theater. I am not going to spoil anything but you may want to stick around during the credits.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside Out is another very impressive animated family feature from Pixar and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of animation."
"Sruthi_Me","10","6","30","28 June 2015"," Brilliant animation. A family entertainer.
","Let me start off with the bad (as yes, the were few. But few, as I said.) <br/><br/>1. As the trailer clearly states, the story revolves around the little voices in our head. The little simple everyday emotions that every human being no mater how old will endure : Joy, Anger, Sadness and Fear. Yes, these are very basic emotions and one could argue that you certainly have more complex emotions out there in the world - one's like guilt, sympathy, narcissism and so on - but if you look at it from a child's point of view (yes, our Riley is simply 11 years old) every emotion ultimately bogs down to those simple few in the end. So, well, I guess I was wrong. Looks like this isn't a bad thing at all. <br/><br/>2. It was pretty kiddish. Yes, I love Disney and yes, I love my animation. But, yes, Inside out was perhaps a tad bit childish. <br/><br/>Now for the good and the great - <br/><br/>1. Brilliant animation - Ridiculously good animation. Pixar has clearly outdone itself. Stunning 3D effects definitely put this in the Frozen league. <br/><br/>2. Interesting twist - It had a nice interesting twist that completely saved the monotony of the movie. You find yourself affected by sadness and are on the brink of despair when, suddenly, tada, here's your typical (or perhaps not) Disney-ish twist. <br/><br/>3. Its a Disney movie - I think that says it all. <br/><br/>Bottom line - Go watch it. Chances are it will win an Oscar (and of course 'Lava' is a bonus)."
"bethayers","10","6","30","26 June 2015"," Be ready to experience many emotions!
","There seem to be two kinds of reviews for this unusual film - those who ""get it"" and those who don't. For me, it was a charming view of how your emotions work, making points about changing and growing that were sometimes overt and sometimes subtle. For others, it seems to have been either too emotionally involving or not involving at all! Personally, I loved every moment. The plot was witty, the characterizations brilliant, and the animation totally up to the usual Pixar/Disney standard.<br/><br/>It was fun to ride along with the emotional roller-coaster going on in Riley's head as she tries her best to cope with the massive stress of moving to a new community. When I was a kid, my family had to move a couple of times, so it was easy for me to relate. Perhaps those that don't relate to Riley have forgotten how hard change can be. On the other hand, people in a brittle emotional state can get TOO involved and react too personally to the pains Riley undergoes - scenes about loss of childhood memories can be poignant, for example.<br/><br/>It's clear that the movie wants you to feel with Riley and think about how your emotions work together to make you a person who can grow and adapt. If you can feel and think at the same time, you will be delighted by the content and quality of this engaging tale."
"tangojazz","10","6","30","25 June 2015"," The greatest psychology cartoon ever made!
","A great movie that appeals equally to children and adults. Not once did I turn away from the screen, which to me is a sure sign of the movie's greatness. ""Inside Out"" is movie about the inner psychology of girl child named Riley from her birth to about eleven years old. The engine that drives the movie is the psychological changes that occurs when Riley's family moves from their home in Minnesota to the San Francisco Bay Area. The changes are represented amusingly enough by cartoon characters called Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear, in both Riley and her parents. To be honest with you, I had some reservations about seeing ""Inside Out."" The previous features I had seen about psychological change in people were pretty serious affairs: ""Steppenwolf"" adapted from the novel by Herman Hesse and starring Max Von Sydow, and ""A Dangerous Method"" directed by Horror Meister David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen and Keira Knightly. Movies definitely not for kids. So, I said to myself, how will Disney make a movie about such a loaded subject? Easy. Stay away from topics like mental illness and pathological criminality, and stick to child and family psychology. Throw in a lot of humor and cartoon slapstick, and you have a movie that talks about emotional growth without the more serious consequences (Although the movie does surprisingly goes to some pretty dark places in the mind, like the subconscious). Comedians Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling and Lewis Black give outstanding performances as the various emotions that, for me, carry the movie. Go see this wonderful movie about ""Psychology 101"" and also, be entertained."

I went to see twice this movie, and both times the people who were around me, drop a tear. It has really emotionally intense moments that will make you feel humble for who you were and what you are now, the train of life. This is a masterpiece and i encourage everyone to watch it.

It's not a movie where you'll be laughing your way throughout it; actually, most of it is like a strong drama. Some themes are not even for children.<br/><br/>One will be following the adventure of Joy and Sadness as they try to get back to ""Head""quarters, where all mind-related happens.

","""Inside Out"" (2015) is a professionally produced comedic adventure animation about the inner emotions Riley, played by Kaitlyn Dias, after she is forced to move from the only place she's ever known to San Francisco. This film is mostly told completely from her emotions, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler, Sadness voiced by Phyllis Smith, Fear voiced by Bill Hader, Anger voiced by Lewis Black and Disgust voiced by Mindy Kaling, are the perfect embodiment of externalizing intangibles. My son and I really identify with this film due to our military history and moving around every three years. This film gives us both a sense of sadness because of its relatability and hopefulness. This is a great film to show children that are dealing with the hardship of moving from a familiar place.<br/><br/>Pete Doctor and Ronnie Del Carmen did a marvelous job capturing the true nature of dealing with a move from the perspective of a child. All the emotions are raging and trying to identify which one takes the front seat is a magical battle on the big screen. I commend the actors and actresses for their portrayal in this film because it is difficult to effectively portray an emotion solely through lines. They did an amazing job bring those additional intangibles to life. Overall this is a great film regardless of some of the critics out there that have deemed it too dark for children. This film, though animation, is a perfect realization of what children go through during an undesired move."

Seeing the world inside Riley's head is a cool concept and manages to lead to some amazing storytelling which is actually very emotional.

","Maybe the best animated movies I've ever seen, 'Inside Out' is very creative and touching at the same time. It makes you think about everything that could be going on inside the mind of a child when she's going through difficult adjustments in her life, and more generally, what goes on inside all of us. I'm not sure why the film has drawn such ire from some viewers, maybe it's just one of those love/hate movies, or maybe you (or a loved one) have to have gone through a serious struggle to have it resonate. I loved the poignant scenes of leaving childhood memories behind (wow! these were just stunning to me), and how the somewhat unlikely hero turned out to be little Sadness."
"sharky_55","9","5","24","29 June 2015"," Emotional manifestations are just like imaginary boyfriends from Canada
","The first Inside Out trailer didn't impress me all that much. It showcased some typical character stereotypes; the unresponsive moody teenager, the sports-obsessed, distracted and distant dad, the romance reminiscing mum. 2 of these still remain in the film, but that trailer omits some crucial bits of interaction inside Riley's brain, now missing they key elements of Joy, and to a lesser extent, Sadness. <br/><br/>The character design of the five emotions isn't the most innovative. Anger is bright red and spews fire when furious. Sadness is droopy and depressingly blue. Disgust is a nauseous shade of green. The brilliance is however from the casting of the voice actors which lends some much needed nuance and expression to the pivotal characters. In particular Lewis Black as the ever exasperated and highly tense Anger who regularly loses control and pushes Riley into action. The star is of course Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler as the ever bubbly point of optimism and the command of Riley's brain. Joy starts off as a very positive and over-eager character, if not a little pushy, but Poehler displays a wider emotional range as the film progresses. A subtle symbol of maturity shows up in the more orderly and cooperative emotions of the parents at their control panels. One might see these as evolutions into empathy and fairness respectively. <br/><br/>Some have expressed unsatisfactory concerns at the overall execution of the concept itself. After all, it's not the most original concept: the sitcom Herman's Head, the comic strip The Numbskulls, Osmosis Jones... Some have even remarked that it is surprisingly mechanical for a Pixar film; it feels less like Riley reacting to the real world and more just simplistic caricatures pushing buttons and her responding to them. There's an alternate interpretation that I can offer in that it actually is the other way around. Sadness isn't just an annoying character looking to push buttons (literally and figuratively) and cause trouble for Riley; rather it's Riley missing home and hockey and friends as a natural reaction that causes Sadness to act up and this manifests in her actions in messing with the core memories. Maybe satisfying for some, but it does slightly undercut the fantastic execution of the concept of the emotions when Joy and Sadness leave in the dinner scene, where Disgust, Fear and Anger try to mimic Joy in a very effective and organic manifestation of a moody teenager that fits in with the narrative. Disgust becomes sarcasm, Fear becomes denial, and Anger becomes passive aggression. <br/><br/>Most will start off hating Sadness, the negative emotion who always seems to find herself in the wrong place and wreak havoc in Riley's brain. It's a legitimate complaint, especially coupled with Joy's insistence on being the command and delegating Sadness to a corner (there's a suggestion here of Riley repressing her Sadness). It's with such ease that the screenplay manages to reverse this and change our opinions of her throughout the film. When Joy relinquishes command to Sadness in the climax where Riley returns home, I fully expected Sadness to formulate empathy and realisation of the effects of what running away from home would do to her parents. Anguish and grief and depression that she could relate to, going through the same herself. What I got instead was a much more natural and organic scene. There's no plot twist or flashback or passionate drive that Riley goes through; it's refreshing to let a character break down and be emotionally overwhelmed as a girl her age often would in such a scenario. It's a gentle and poignant reminder that it's okay and important to sometimes let it out and be sad. Recognising and making mistakes like Riley does paves the way for newer, more complex memories. <br/><br/>Inside Out's humour is strong, although that is in itself subjective. There's a wealth of details within the concept that lend itself to funny scenes, like the maintenance workers deleting useless information (Save Chopsticks and Heart & Soul, forget the rest), the mix-up between facts and opinions, the repeating chewing gum commercial. There's also plenty of more obscure material and references that adults might spot (Forget it Jake, it's Cloudtown). And how about the five Angers that reside permanently in the bus driver's head?<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino returns for his fifth Pixar collaboration after wonderful scores such as those from Ratatouille, The Incredibles and Up. ""Married Life"" is an extremely elegant and emotionally poignant few minutes of Pixar history. His Inside out composition is equally brilliant. The main theme, ""Bundle of Joy"" highlights a simple piano riff that basks in its ambiance and constantly switches from major to minor keys, contrasting the beauty of joy and sadness. Giacchino excels in those quiet emotionally significant moments, the best of these being the melodic night sequence where Joy ice-skates along with Riley in her dreams. <br/><br/>Inside Out once again demonstrates Pixar's mastery in handling emotionally dense material even in a relatively kid-friendly environment where the line between juvenile and heavy adulthood is hard to toe. It balances humour with dramatic stakes for very real and complex characters. When Joy and Sadness rush to prevent Riley from falling into depression (failing to feel any emotion at all), it's tense and makes for an even more emotionally draining and important scene when they are finally released in her tears. This is Pixar at its most emotionally resonant."

Just with the visual, this movie already stands out, but, beyond that, Pixar delivers one of the best stories of its productions, this original and bold plot kept me on the edge of my seat for being so emotional and involving. It takes place in the mind of a 11-year girl named Riley who is suffering big changes in her life. Inside her head, five emotions are managing the control center, Joy, Fear, Sadness, Disgust and Anger. Each feeling has at least one shining and incredible moment.<br/><br/>They got right regarding the choice for the characters' voices, specially for the emotions, as each voice enhanced the different temperament making them much more remarkable and special. Lewis Black as Anger is hilarious, his voice bring a sarcasm and acid humor. Joy has the voice of Amy Poehler , a cheerful voice with positive thoughts and always trying to see the bright side of the situation. By the voice of Bill Hader, Fear is that insecure and cautious guy that thinks over and over again before doing it. Mindy Kaling gives Disgust a voice of a bitter girl and that seems to doesn't care too much about others think as well as creating Riley's tastes. Sadness has the voice of Phyllis Smith and she is presumably has no desire to achieve something and always depressive, but the innovation was not make her a villain, instead, learning to live with it and the mixture of this emotions and so many others is what make us grow up as happenings and experiences happen in our life.<br/><br/>The story is very captivating and intelligent, it made me laugh a lot of times and it was not always silly and childish jokes, identify myself in what was going on in the film and even made me cry much due to Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend. The most incredible is that Inside Out doesn't have necessarily has a focus in the younger audience. The children may not understand or perceive some subtleties, but they will love the characters' journey. The older viewers might as well board the adventure and have fun, besides, will recognize the nuances and messages that the picture is talking about. Given that the film uses a lot of psychology to explain the process of maturing, of course beneath all the glowing sceneries and colorful characters, but there's no doubt about the symbolisms in it. In the end, Inside Out is a fantastic movie with a outstanding visual and touching message. I don't know if it's going to win, but surely this movie will in the 2016 Oscar."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","6","31","9 October 2015"," Pixar and Disney keep delivering
","It has been quite some time since ""Up"", the last full feature movie Pete Docter directed, but he hasn't forgotten anything in these past 5 years. ""Inside Out"" runs for slightly over 100 minutes and is a most creative take on what is going on inside a young girl's head when she has to leave her home state Minnesota to move to San Francisco. There are 5 states of emotion inside her head, all in different colors: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. I have to say I was quite wondering for a large part of the film why 4 are negative and only one is positive. My explanation is probably that from the filmmaker's perspective it made sense as the positive one and one of the negative ones are absent for a while and this is when the girl is at her worst.<br/><br/>I thought this movie needed a little while to really get going. It got better when Joy and Sadness left the central and we actually had one positive and one negative emotion in the center of the movie and also the characters they meet on their journey together. The most memorable of these is probably Bing Bong, an imaginary friend the girl had when she was younger. The disappearance of Bing Bong is also one of the most emotional moments down in the dark valley of lost memories. This valley was an inclusion as smart as the one that all memories are stored in balls. Another part I liked from a more positive perspective was the one scene where we see the girl ice skating and we see Joy do exactly the same in a synchronous manner, possibly my favorite moment from the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>The ending is absolutely brilliant again, Pixar at their best. It already starts with the Bing Bong scene I mentioned earlier, but it keeps going until the very end. The moment we see Joy let Sadness touch these balls of the past, so these memories stop being pleasant, but become sad memories is something that will wet your eyes. It's necessary to see these as sad in order to make space for new positive memories. And the home sickness scene that follows right afterwards is at least as good with the girl and her parents hugging it out.<br/><br/>It's tough to find any criticism with this movie. Maybe one would be that I did not like the first half as much as the second half and that with all the displays of great animation and creativity, the movie sometimes had long sequences that lacked being really funny. Or that they were some childish scenes early on like the constant monkey imitation game, which certainly elaborates on the characters' relationships, but may have been enough once or twice. ""Inside Out"" is the big front-runner for animated movie of the year and very likely to win the Oscar in that category. Deservedly so. This is on par with Pixar's best, especially towards the end. I saw that there will be a little short film that follows the feature film and I am curious about how this is gonna look like. Oh yeah, I also liked how they went into other people's heads occasionally, such as the parents, or some others during the closing credits. This really brought some nice comic relief.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Inside Out"" is another triumph for both Pixar and Disney. The younger audiences will have a fun time with all the colorful and entertaining characters and the grown-ups will as well because of the emotional impact this movie makes. Highly recommended and finally also a quick word on ""Lava"", a short film that is shown before the movie in theaters and has a beautiful storyline and music as well: I did not like the German dub as much as the English original, but it was still an entertaining 5-6 minutes. Do not miss out on these two, because you would really miss out on a lot of awesomeness."

","At first sight, I thought this movie was going to be another animation movie like thousands of them but I was completely wrong. What such a fantastic and original movie!<br/><br/>I had to take a little time to get used to each character and their personality. At first, I didn't know what character was talking about, but after that brief moment you'll hooked on the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is about the thoughts and feelings which are inside of the mind of a little 12 years old girl and how these feelings are represented by each one of the characters that appears in the story: anger, joy, sadness, disgust and fear. Each one of these characters has been pretty well represented and characterised being so easy to identify yourself with one of them. You will love it!<br/><br/>The story will take you into different stages, involving each character mentioned above. The movie has everything and you will feel that anger, joy, fear, sadness and disgust of the little girl and her feelings. My recommendation is preparing some Kleenex for the final part of the movie. You will probably need it. It is difficult for me to express what this movie represents. It is completely different to other animation films. Just run to watch it. It deserves each minute. Looking forward to watching the second part of Inside Out! I really hope Walt Disney is working on it!"
"lamemoviesguy","10","6","31","19 June 2015"," Beautiful movie!
","It is among the best animation movies I have ever seen. The animation in the movie is characteristic of Pixar and nothing new, but the cleverly novel concept of the story stands out. Light humor added to a brilliant story makes the ride so much more joyful. My favorite character in the movie (sadly) is sadness. <br/><br/>Without giving away too much, I must state that the movie will not be fully appreciated by kids, not for any adult situations but for the abstract concept and the movie's figurative approach to it. However, teenagers and adults should surely appreciate and contemplate upon this beautiful film. While most of commercial Hollywood today seems immersed in superheroes, aliens and similar other nonsense, here is one movie that, while still taking the imagination approach, makes such meaningful statements about our real life."
"robsta23","10","6","31","18 June 2015"," Best Movie of 2015 So Far!!!
","To break down Inside Out is to break down the mind and all of its beautiful complexities. While the idea of characterizing the emotions of the human is not exactly original (look up the short play ""Bob's Date"") PIXAR tackles it in a very original way. The organization of the mind may seem simple at first in this film, but we see through the amazing digital set designs in Inside Out that the mind is highly complex, and its various parts or sections are very dependent on each other. I am not saying we did not know the mind is complex, but the film illustrates the mind with an original layout while letting the audience know it is still complex.<br/><br/>While the focus is highly on how the emotions control the person, the person herself, Riley, is very crucial to the story. She is a very joyful kid who finds herself moving to a new area with her family in the opening credit sequence. This happens to put Riley, as well as her emotions, through new obstacles, and the protagonist, Joy, struggles to keep Riley happy for the first time in their lives. This leads to an event which separates Joy and Sadness from the headquarters, and Riley's mood becomes similar to depression, though it is never labeled as such but is heavily implied.<br/><br/>What the film beautifully illustrates is the idea that when people have crises, the mind itself is having its own crisis to create or add to the external problems - a beautiful correlation between the external and the internal. The primary struggle is between Joy and Sadness, and it starts out as Joy attempting to suppress Sadness as much as possible and moves towards Joy finding worth in Sadness gradually. This relationship moves towards one of the most sentimental scenes in the history of PIXAR, which brought this viewer to tears.<br/><br/>Aside from having a great story structure and a great character arc for both Joy and Sadness, Inside Out is hilarious throughout with great running gags and clever moments which give character to aspects of the mind other than the emotions (if you really want to laugh, stay for the footage during the credits, and keep in mind there is nothing AFTER the credits). Dreaming is treated like a movie set - an idea that is supposedly illustrated in Inception if viewers pay enough attention - and Fear becomes a sort of film critic for a brief segment. For the funniest running gag in the film, all I will say is it involves when songs get stuck in the head.<br/><br/>This movie cleverly and ironically makes the audience feel the best of joy with its comedy as well as the worst of sadness/sympathy with its sentimental moments. It is simply a must-see film - one of the best PIXAR movies to date, and my favorite to have been directed by Pete Docter!"
"ClaytonDavis","7","6","31","16 June 2015"," In the Top-Tier of Pixar's Already Stunning List of Features
","The buzz has been huge for Pixar's latest venture about the mind of a little girl and the emotions that live within her. Writer/directors Pete Docter and Ronaldo del Carmen, along with co-scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley create a film with the most simple and authentic concept, and turns it into a methodical, moving, and layered story with so many different themes to indulge. Though there is a minor element to the film that leaves you a bit cold, ""Inside Out"" is clearly successful in its approach and just about everything you want in a family film this time of year.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" tells the story of Riley, an eleven-year-old girl whose family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. In her mind live five real, and relatable feelings: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. When Joy and Sadness accidentally are thrown into the land of Riley's long-term memories, Riley undergoes a barrage of emotions that are affecting her relationships with family, friends, and the things she loves. Now, Joy and Sadness must get back to her core command in order to restore Riley's feelings and relationships.<br/><br/>Teamed with the voice talents of Amy Poehler ( who plays ""Joy""), Phyllis Smith (who plays ""Sadness""), Bill Hader (who plays ""Fear""), Lewis Black (who plays ""Anger""), and Mindy Kaling (who plays ""Disgust""), Pixar's joyful and moving animated feature presents equal parts of humor and tears. A fascinating deconstruction of the mind of a child, and the changes they endure along the way. The subject matter is among Pixar's most ambitious and their most impressive since ""WALL-E.""<br/><br/>What shines bright is the stunning animation on screen. A beautiful array of colors, just hypnotizing to the eyes as ""Joy"" and ""Sadness"" venture off into different parts of Riley's mind. I'd say this is definitely among Pixar's most alluring and aesthetically beautiful films they've ever created.<br/><br/>As we've come to expect from an Oscar-winning composer like Michael Giacchino, the score for ""Inside Out"" is subtly impeccable. Among his most reserved compositions, Giacchino takes a back seat to the story and lets the film do its work through imagery and narration.<br/><br/>Presenting another key reason for a Voice Work Oscar to be created, both Poehler and Smith are downright magnificent in two of the year's finest performances. Poehler's Joy anchors the film with a glaze of sweetness, and when called upon, will break your heart with epic emotions. Smith's Sadness is a devastating but truly compelling creation, as she bridges our thoughts through tears and loss. Those two will be putting your tearducts to work and in overdrive in several moments. This is another shining example of a female-driven feature that is just as enjoyable, if not more, than any other male protagonist in films today. Film producers need to start taking notice of the slate of successes this year and what they need to do change the landscape.<br/><br/>Where the film doesn't completely connect is in its supporting characters, in particular Anger and Disgust. With no fault going to the sensational voice work of Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling, the narrative creation of their place in the story doesn't seem to quite jive. ""Anger"" is a simple emotion to portray, but I minor found inconsistencies in his character's actions that were noticeable. ""Disgust,"" which probably would have been better off being called ""Sarcasm"" just didn't seem like a core emotion that I think exists in the mind of an eleven year old girl. While I think ""Disgust"" is something that the younger minds can easily understand, I think a different direction may have been needed for her inclusion. Other players like Bill Hader, Diane Lane (who plays Mom), and Kyle MacLachlan (who plays Dad) are strongly assembled. Special shout out to Kaitlyn Dias, who voices Riley, is vivaciously real in each delivery and each line.<br/><br/>With no shortage of tears for the adults, and big laughs for the kids, ""Inside Out"" fits firmly in the top-tier of Pixar's most vibrant pictures. An echo of love and vulnerability, the feature is gorgeously inventive and passionately executed. A fine selection for all to enjoy, no matter what age. Your frontrunner for the Animated Feature Oscar for 2015 has arrived.<br/><br/>In addition, the Pixar short ""Lava"" is stunningly delightful and powerfully engaging. Likely another contender for an Animated Short Academy Award.<br/><br/>Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"
"hsinyipang","7","4","18","24 July 2016"," Enjoyable but overrated
","In my opinion, this movie is just a tad overrated. Here we'll start with what I deem the most important aspect to every movie's entertainment: characters. That's right, if I don't care about one or more of the movie's characters, it's hard for me to get into it. Now, I wouldn't say that Inside Out's characters were bad per se, however I would say they were pretty one-dimensional, particularly the 5 emotions. But how could they not be to some extent though? After all, they're all basically single emotions personalized into physical beings, rather than a whole human character. Therefore, I'll first state that I have no problems with how the scriptwriters have handled them, considering that there aren't really any other options in regards to how they could've written them. But that in itself is a problem I have with the entire concept of the movie. Now, as a whole, the concept is a very clever and innovative one; it explains how our minds work through creative metaphors and analogies that are easy for the audience to grasp. But for this concept to work, the characters of the personified emotions would have to only be limited to the traits of the emotion they are meant to represent respectively, otherwise they would miss the point of their respective character altogether. Thus, they'd have no choice but to be confined in stereotypical boxes, with not much space for their personalities to be expanded upon, thus they become predictable and repetitive after a while. This wouldn't be much of a problem for people who pay more attention to the general concept and storyline, as the character's interactions would be enough to keep them entertained during the filler parts, but as I said, I really want to focus on the characters when watching a movie, and relying on interactions(no matter how meaningful or entertaining) solely just isn't enough for me. So I guess this concept just isn't for me, though I do think of it as clever and charming.<br/><br/>Now on to the main human character, Riley. I'll start by saying that I really like how they distanced her from stereotypes as much as possible. She has both a girly and a boyish side to her, for example. And there's also a bunch of random traits and preferences thrown into her character, like hating broccoli, goofball etc. To be honest, I liked this, as I do think that our personalities are comprised of many different traits and preferences which all stems from our reaction to past experiences. Some of these traits make us seem like a walking stereotype, while others make us seem like a walking contradiction. However, the problem I have with her character is exactly the opposite of the problem I had with the emotions'. When the emotions interacted together, you could see that they were all bursting with their own personalities which made them very distinguishable from each other. They were like a rainbow when joined together, however each one of them only represented their own respective color, and if you examined them on their own, they turn into a one-dimensional stereotype, like when you take one color out of the rainbow and focus on it, it will seem bland and flat to your eyes. But put them together, and you get a very colorful image. As for Riley, it's like taking a bunch of different colors and mixing them together, only to get a murky saturation. Sure she has a bunch of traits mixed into her character, but none of them are developed enough, and so they remain just general traits that just sort of mix together to make up a bland, uninteresting character that I feel indifferent about.<br/><br/>Another(albeit minor) complaint I have is that the film seems to drag on half-way through, specifically when Joy and Sadness are trying to navigate their way back to headquarters. The whole journey just seemed to drag when I was watching the film, and my interest waned. That's not to say that there are no entertaining moments throughout the film, however, as there are certainly moments of charm and humor shared between the characters. Not to mention the little moment shared between Sadness and Bing Bong (definitely one of my favorite moments in the film, as it was inspiring, moving and powerful all at the same time, and it was an important scene of foreshadowing towards the end) and of course, when Joy and Bing Bong were trapped in the memory dump (though I wasn't quite as moved at the scene as most people were, because I found it predictable and wasn't too attached to Bing Bong's character in the first place). However, aside from those two important parts, the rest of the journey seemed mundane, and while there were the aforementioned charming moments littered here and there across it, they felt too short and fleeting to enliven the entire journey for me, so the sense of boredom still lingered throughout the course of the movie.<br/><br/>So, those are my main issues with the film. Like most people here, I felt that the end scene was truly amazing, as it captured the feelings of longing and reminiscence perfectly, allowing for an empathetic bond to form between the audience and main character. It has moved me in more ways than one, it has deeply inspired me with it's message of emotional intelligence, and that is no easy feat. Yet, the movie manages to do just that with one scene alone; it was that powerful. Overall, I would say that the movie is successful in presenting the difference between the feeling of suppressing an emotion and the feeling of actually feeling that emotion. For that, I would say I liked it overall. But the issues I had with it (particularly in regards to the character department) definitely dampened my experience of viewing it. Thus, I'd say that I probably don't favor it quite as much as most people on here do."

"doggieluvr-50997","6","3","12","19 June 2017"," I want to like this movie but...
","I have seen this film twice. Most people seem to love it and regard it as one of the best Pixar films ever. I can't and I never will. This film is based on a not so every day struggle of a little girl having to go through leaving her friends and home town to a new city across country. Her parents are trying to make the best of it but things just aren't going their way. The girl, Riley, has five main emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust (The emotions are portrayed as humanoid characters). They run into trouble resulting in losing what are called Riley's ""core memories"" in her mind and need to find them immediately. However, joy and sadness get separated and need to find the core memories and get them back to the main HQ of Riley's mind. With Joy and Sadness gone, the other emotions frantically try to work Riley through every day life while Joy and Sadness are absent. They end up making things even worse for Riley and drive Riley to running away from home. Joy and Sadness find the core memories and make the journey back to HQ and restore Riley's happiness and sadness which compel her to run home to her worried parents. In the long run, the emotions grow stronger and realize each one of them is important to Riley's every day thoughts and emotions, even sadness. <br/><br/>Now, while this sounds like a fairly decent plot, I can't say it was executed that well. Most of the movie is focused on the emotion characters, Joy and Sadness, and how Joy comes to realize Sadness is an important emotion just like her and Sadness realizes she is helpful and too, is important. But, we don't see this realization very clearly and it's kinda thrown at us at the end. Most of the journey Joy and Sadness endures is not very team building (between each other) and is pretty boring. While Joy and Sadness are missing, this should mean Riley can't feel those emotions because they aren't there in HQ controlling her expressions and thoughts. It's clear that Riley is not joyful or happy, but it is clear she is depressed, a form of sadness that she shouldn't be able to feel (a plot hole that is unexplained).<br/><br/>For a movie based around emotions, I can't say the emotions are evenly expressed by any means. For the entire film, probably 60-70% is sad, 20% is joy, and the rest is the last emotions. I would have liked to have seen a more even spread of the emotions in Riley's struggle. Fear, Anger, and Disgust feel so under developed and practically worthless it's easy to forget they're even there.<br/><br/>Not to mention, the imaginary friend, ""Bing Bong"" was not that much needed. He was needed because they needed a character to sacrifice for the ""greater good"". He was a well designed character and nicely developed, but was just a prop for one section of the film.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was pretty bland. For a movie based on such a nice range of emotions, it really felt lack luster and dull. I did tear up a little at the end where Riley and her parents reunite, but I felt no emotions until the last maybe 15-20 minutes of the film. I can't say this was a bad movie, but it wasn't very good either. It was fine and I could watch it again, but not for a while."

","I've always been bit fan of Pixar films. I grew up with Andy in Toy Story (literally we graduated the same year) and there have been some fantastic movies in the interim, but none quite like Inside Out. On an emotional level this movie hits a home run. Whether you are a kid or an adult this movie really hits home on the human experience, namely our emotions and what we are actually feeling and what makes us ourselves. Not that it's an hour and a half of constant crying or anything; it is also a funny movie, really funny. I think this is impart to the wonderful voice casting. As far as the story line goes it is pretty classic problem, climax, solution, but it's classic because it works. It's well written and keeps moving without rushing. <br/><br/>On a different note, I wish I had some background in psychology because I'm very curious to know exactly how accurate their anthropology is. Don't get me wrong, it seems accurate...but I would have to say that it wasn't clear what the role of free will and intellect played along with the emotions. That being said the main character is only an 11 year old so the emotions will be a much bigger player than an adult (we hope). Nonetheless, it's not a documentary, but an incredibly fun, entertaining, and tear jerking movie. For me it goes down as a classic!"

Although there are some things which children will understand like Bing Bong, who is a character similar to any other cartoons, a story and of course, animation. However, it tackles some mature subjects like death (Bing Bong sacrifice himself in the end, sorry for the spoiler.),running away and morals. But this is one of the best films I see ever, it is also unexpected that PIXAR can create a film so good because for the past few years they have release things which I do not find it is interesting like Brave and Monsters University, this is one of the best films by then in the 2010s for this point of time."

OK, I know this idea of living emotions has been done to death one too many times, there were some perceptions that were decent, others were not as good, but Inside Out managed to pull it off perfectly! This film taught me that originality doesn't always matter, but rather how good you manage to percept the idea. The film also is a good film to watch for all ages, of course, younger children may not be able to understand the concept, but older kids, teens, and adults can get laughs and a few tear-jerkers from this movie. If anything, the plot of Riley moving to San Francisco fits the situation of Sadness being needed all along perfectly. This is definitely one of the best animated films I've seen in recent years and that's saying something. (cough) Food Fight is bad!

"kieranbattams","10","6","32","4 August 2015"," a JOY to watch..
","Yeah i used an emotion pun, sue me.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a film I've been hyped for, we got no Pixar film at all last year, but it has been worth the wait because Inside Out more than makes up for it. All i will talk about here is the basic premise. I went into this film knowing only that and it was for the best as it was a genuine surprise. Riley is an 11 year old girl growing up with her parents and moving house which is always a time of mixed emotions. Speaking of emotions, her mind is controlled by 5 of them Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The way these emotions control her mind is so clever and fun to see. The standout is Lewis Black as Anger. He was incredibly funny and a joy to watch (ironically). I also love Amy Poeller as Joy. The cast was perfectly chosen and she is pure proof of it. She is relatable and we feel for her as all she wants is the best for Riley, like another character in the film who i feel i can't talk about as this character in particular comes as a genuine surprise.<br/><br/>Joy and Sadness go on a journey to preserve Riley's memories, leaving the other emotions in charge. I also loved this as it gave us some of the funnier moments of the film to see how her mind worked with limited emotion. The cleverness came from the simplest things such as how a certain advertisement can get stuck in your head for days or how you forget a certain memory, but again i feel i have to keep these aspects brief. Sure it will sound like a cheap pun to say it, but Inside Out is the most emotional Pixar film for ages. Everyone will at least relate to one character or situation. Admit it, we all have a friend like Bill Hader's Fear. It makes me wonder how our minds actually do work. Emotions just seemed to get way more interesting. Its like the questions Toy Story put in our heads, but as weird as it sounds they seem more real here.<br/><br/>The way this film is given to us, it is more of an adult film. Pixar are great at giving us films that kids and adults will love, they have definitely done it again. It is so clever that all of the references to real life that we are given will fly straight over kids heads, but they will love the journey and adventure Joy and Sadness go on. I like that a lot. I can't think of a single flaw i have with this film. The perfect film is something that is almost impossible to come by, yet this is probably the closest we will get. I knew this film would be great, but Inside Out exceeded all my expectations. It is literally a film for anyone and everyone. Well done Pixar, once again you have outdone yourself. I cannot recommend this film enough and i give it my highest rating of 10/10."
"KineticSeoul","10","6","32","3 August 2015"," My favorite movie of 2015
","This is a family animated movie that the whole family can thoroughly enjoy. I personally think adults will enjoy this movie more than the kids though. While movies like ""Minions"" is something kids might have more fun with. Well most kids anyway...Just my opinion. I never saw the trailer to this movie before watching this movie and when I saw posters for this film. I didn't put much thought about it and thought it would be another generic kids movie. I was totally wrong, this is probably my favorite movie of 2015. It really is a brilliant animated movie that moves the inner emotions. As a matter of fact that is what this movie is about, emotions. Like how it would be like if each emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear had their own characteristics. Even if the two main emotions in this movie is Joy and Sadness. Because they are the ones on the journey back the the headquarters, while the other emotions tries to keep things under control. Each emotions interactions and how they work together mainly in the control room of the mind of a little girl named Riley was very creatively executed. And how they each has a role like a job in the human mind was wacky and yet fun. So yeah, it has a awesome premise and direction going for it. This movie had potential and took it to another level. The reason I think a lot of adult would really enjoy this movie, is because of the nostalgic and empathetic factors because of life experiences. Watching this movie was like a really good Dr. Seuss story come to life. It came from the creative minds of Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen. I felt like I was part of this movie and felt what the protagonist Riley was going through. This truly is a heartfelt movie with a lot of heart to it and it's also whimsical at the same time. I thought it was highly imaginative how they also incorporated imagination, conscious, unconscious, subconscious, memories and dreams. To put it simply, this is a film I really needed to watch.

","Went to watch this movie by myself at the 2nd last day of screening ... so glad I ended up going by myself (and I was the only one on my row) as I pretty much tearing from the beginning to the end - which is a movie experience that totally new to me.<br/><br/>I was quite surprise to read quite many negative reviews here afterward - OK I have to agree it probably is not a movie for kids in a way that kids will fully understand the meaning of it - and it is not the type of entertaining movie that have a ""save the world and everyone happy and bad guys died"" storyline - it is - much much more than it. <br/><br/>To me, watching this movie is like riding a roller coaster with the name ""emotion/feeling"", and with mirrors all around me. It is so therapeutic in a way that it kind of like opened my heart up and showing the vulnerable part of it, then give me a big cuddle and tell me you have been doing well, despite there had been sadness and fear, just like most people have in a reality life. <br/><br/>I think people at different stage of life will have different feeling and interpretation on this movie. And probably a better understanding on people around them too.<br/><br/>A very joyful movie to watch, which touched my heart so much that tears kept coming out from my eyes ... and yes, Joy and Sadness are not enemy, but allies :-) You have to go through the sadness and fear, in order to understand, and appreciate happiness :)"
"CinematicInceptions","8","5","25","31 March 2016"," Makes you look at life differently.
","I was unable to stop myself from molding the ideas in this movie into my own life after watching it, but I think that was the intent. Even if you didn't enjoy it, it would probably be pretty hard not to think about what your own core memories and islands of personality look like and how your emotional headquarters function. It makes you a much more self- conscious person and makes you re-think certain times in your life. I couldn't tell you what any of my core memories are, but I can attest that moving to a new place can throw you off emotionally, which is part of why I wanted to write this review. I've moved six times in my childhood, and I don't think it's a coincidence that the most difficult one came when I was about the same age as Riley is. Granted, I never had any hugely dramatic moment where everything fell apart, but since it was her first time moving, it makes sense that Riley went through her transformation in a week and had that emotional breakdown in class. That moment when Sadness changes the emotion of the core memory is reflective of Riley coming to terms with the fact that she will never be able to experience that again.<br/><br/>This was what made the movie so interesting for me to watch even in scenes that really only showed how Joy and Sadness were moving around Riley's mind. Where the two emotions go or what they do don't really matter, but all of the development we get from Joy and Sadness is really development for Riley. When Joy resists the other emotions and tries to take over, as with the makeshift hockey game, that's Riley trying to hide from the insecurity she feels when she isn't happy. But it seems that the other emotions are able to take control when they feel like they know what's best, all except Sadness. Almost Riley's whole life has been defined by happiness, so she doesn't know how to be sad. Then, she learns how to subconsciously through the ultimate loss of Bing-Bong.<br/><br/>I think this is a great thing to touch upon, especially coming from Disney since you wouldn't expect them to promote anything but joy. Most of the people who enjoy Disney movies have the same complex as Riley where they don't know how to be sad, and it's no wonder. Parents, both in life and in the movie, feel like there's something wrong if their kids aren't happy and are often saying that optimism and positive attitudes are the way to go. But this movie is saying that the trick is to be able to channel all emotions in a healthy way, not to suppress them. Though most of us wish all our memories were ""yellow-tinted"", we need those other emotions to motivate us to act or work through problems. Plus, too much of an emotion can lead to issues like sadness becoming depression or laziness, fear becoming paranoia, joy feeding an unhealthy addiction, disgust escalating into arrogance, and anger becoming hateful. Often dystopian literature shows how societies can become evil if ruled by emotion. Brave New World shows a nation ruled by joy, the Giver and V for Vendetta by fear, Snowpiercer, Gattaca, and Hunger Games by disgust, Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 by anger, and Equilibrium by no emotion at all. Some of those comparisons might not make a lot of sense, but I'm being a little liberal with my interpretations so they probably won't match yours.<br/><br/>I was glad that Disney was the one to bring this idea to the big screen, because I feel like some other studio's animation counterparts might have gotten too caught up in clever jokes to throw in and detract from the theme. Certainly there were some mind jokes here, but the only time I felt like they went too far was in the dream sequence. It worked for the plot, but it wasn't original or amusing enough to not contribute at all to the theme. Otherwise, I found most of the jokes genuinely funny and was only annoyed a couple of times by the humor. The script did well with pacing and the dialogue was decent, even if their portrayal of middle schoolers was a little off in my opinion. I liked how they made the dad's headquarters work like a blend of NASA and a war room. The voice actors were pretty well cast, and I especially liked Bill Hader as fear.<br/><br/>People talk about how a lot of Disney movies can accommodate audiences of all ages, which is an assessment I often disagree with, but I think it is mostly true here. All of us have had our islands of personality collapse or whatever at some point, so we've all been here, and we all know what it's like to feel emotional, so the story is easier to relate to than other acclaimed works like Up, Nemo, or Lion King. There are some valid gripes that can be made about it, and you can read other reviews to see those, but I thought it totally deserved the best animated Oscar, maybe even best animated movie ever. Normally, I don't like animated movies even those that are well done, but I would encourage most people to go and see this. It may not be any more entertaining or intelligent than other animated films, but it will alter your perspective on life at least a little. Overall Rating: 8.3/10."
"Nightmarelogic","8","5","25","15 February 2016"," All your emotions have value
","First off the really low review flabbergast me. I found this movie incredibly moving but then I am an adult with no children. This might be an animated feature but it is most definitely not for children. If anything I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't gotten a good grip on their childhood. This is about Riley. Riley is a happy child but then her life suddenly changes when her family moves and a sequence of unfortunate events happens. A large part of the story happens ""inside her"" and shows her emotions as characters. The character of Joy has always been the one in control until Sadness makes an unfortunate error that puts them both on a journey of discovery inside Riley and they both discover who Riley really is. This is by no means a perfect movie and again not for children but I would recommend it to anyone who has a firm grasp on their past and likes a good animated story. My overall takeaway was that all emotions have value."
"nicolechan916","7","5","25","7 July 2015"," Cool concept and animation with interesting characters.
","Based on all the hype I was expecting this film to be more than it was. It was still pretty good, but not something I would want to watch again - as a few of my friends said they would (and one did).<br/><br/>The animation is very descriptive, colourful and cute. The shapes of the emotions and their colours are very typical of what we may attribute them to look. I'm a little confused at what 'gender' they might be and why it differs, because in the mother's head they are all female and pretty much look the same. I'm not sure about the father, but they might have all been male too, but don't look the same, rather are the same shape and pretty much the same look as the ones in Riley's head. Perhaps this is alluding to the idea that puberty/growing up changes the emotions in our heads, which make sense.<br/><br/>The voice actors were pretty good, they match the feel of their characters really well and nothing seemed out of place. Richard Kind, who plays Bing Bong is a small treat and his creation is something that I think most everyone can relate to.<br/><br/>I feel like I have outgrown most animation films, as I have been saying for awhile now. Some I can find quite enjoyable and love them to bits (Despicable Me, Tangled), but others though are enjoyable to watch I don't have much of an affinity for.<br/><br/>There was a short film at the beginning before Inside Out started, and I was not really impressed by it.

","I grew up with Pixar and have seen all their movies up to Toy Story 3 (which I loved), but their last few didn't appeal to me. After growing used to the original and endlessly creative ideas it churned out, its recent (and upcoming) reliance on sequels had me worried it was done making the level of quality it had started with. This movie quelled those fears. <br/><br/>Inside Out isn't the funniest thing Pixar has made, but it doesn't try to be. It's more focused on making you feel, and think as well. That isn't to say there aren't some good laughs in it, but there's some space between them. In that space are ideas so clever about how our brains work that it's hard to keep from smiling. The story is compelling, the voice cast is great, and the vast majority of jokes land. <br/><br/>It does drag a little around the 2/3 mark, which is the main reason why this movie lost a point or two, but if you're a parent this could probably be a 9 or a 10 for you pretty easily (If your kids are super young, though, you might not want to bring them to this. Many in my theater seemed bored). <br/><br/>This is worth paying to see, especially if you've been waiting for Pixar to get back on top of its game. 8/10<br/><br/>P.S: The accompanying short is about singing volcanoes. It really (really) isn't good, but don't tell me you don't want to see how bizarre that could be."
"foamyfan15010","10","6","33","2 April 2016"," One of the best animated films EVER
","I find myself completely baffled looking through the reviews for this movie. Did we not all watch the same film? Boring? Unimaginative? Depressing? I'm shocked and frankly disgusted with how one dimensional and shallow the general public seems to be. 'Inside Out' is not only one of the most visually beautiful animated films I've ever seen but I also feel that it's SO IMPORTANT for children to watch! The writers so expertly managed to fit the complexities of a child growing up and encountering situations and emotions they've never experienced before. Riley is struggling with adolescence and all the horrible awkwardness and sadness that goes along with losing the innocent simpleness of childhood. <br/><br/>I respect this film so much for not underestimating the intelligence of children. Yes, there are some 'mature' themes present in the film. Clearly the writers were trying to convey the struggle many young people have with depression. That's why I feel it's so crucial to HAVE a film like this geared toward the young! What a brilliant way to physically SHOW them what joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness LOOK like. This film visually details how our minds process emotion and more often than not, how it's impossible to always find the silver lining in a sky full of storm clouds. More importantly, it conveys the message that it's okay to be sad sometimes, that sadness is just as important as joy but not to let yourself get lost inside your own head. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for a cleverly written, humorous, introspective look into the human psyche. If you're only in the market for mindless humor and maybe some catchy songs, move along. This is not the movie for you."

","I think this movie will know be among the best that Pixar has done and I think you are asking: is this film at that level: Monsters.inc, Toy Story, Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, etc. Pixar have made one of the best companies in terms of animation. yes, if it's a great movie, if an interesting plot, has good history, scenery and colorful characters and a great climax that make this film a masterpiece, I personally lying if I said I did not cry and excited with Inside-Out with especially the scene in which Bing-Bong sacrifices to Joy could save Riley and the scene in which Joy realizes the importance of Sadness. I truly believe that when we look into the future to the past and think in 2015 immediately remember those sweet and colorful scenes in addition to the hilarious physical comedy scenes of Fear, which reminds me of Matt Smith's role in the television series Doctor Who besides that scene in which deceives Anger Disgust using it to melt and leaving the window Joy and Sadness enter the headquarters. Personally I think this film came easily to the 2nd or 3rd 1st place of the top five Pixar Movies faithfully as I think it's great, grand, sweet and full of emotion."

","Inside Out is a masterpiece. It's the first movie this year to really blow me away, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It really is worthy of all the hype surrounding it, and that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>This movie's writing and execution is clever and fantastic. They managed to explain the simple and everyday things and thoughts that cross our minds brilliantly with just the right amount of comedy and heart. Never has a movie made me think ""That makes so much sense!"" quite so often, all the while making me laugh harder than any movie I've seen in a long time, and also making me emotional for its beautiful elements and moments. Inside Out is an absolute delight, and I honestly can't wait to watch it again.<br/><br/>Both adults and kids will most likely enjoy this movie, even if some of the elements might go over some kids' heads. Personally, I think everyone should see it. It's a fantastic film, and the 94-minute runtime just flew by me. I highly recommend it."
"MUFCOK","9","7","41","12 August 2015"," Very intelligent and beautifully created. Another masterpiece from Pixar.
","I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews for this movie, I have seen almost every Pixar movie and this is up there with the best of them and is beyond doubt one of the most intelligent films they have created. Now, I can understand how people with young children were disappointed as I do believe that the message and themes in the movie are too mature for toddlers, but to mark a film as 1 out of 10 because of this isn't fair at all.. Inside Out should be appreciated for what it is and rated accordingly.<br/><br/>Inside Out is the story of a young girl called Riley, she is 11 and her family have left their suburban life and relocated to San Francisco, leaving behind all of Riley's friends and hobbies. In her new town she Is forced to fit in at school, keep a brave face for her Parents and adapt to the everyday changes of living in a busy city. The majority of the movie is based inside Riley's brain with her emotions playing the roles of physical characters - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust. When Riley's 'buttons are pushed' by others, the characters physically push buttons in her brain, determining what emotions she is feeling and what expressions she comes out with in real life.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away in terms of the story as the trailers have done an unusually good job of not revealing any of the plot points. All I will say is that Inside Out is an incredibly creative movie which transports its viewers into a breath- taking environment with some fantastic aspects. The characters used are all executed very well and fit together perfectly creating some very good on screen chemistry and touching relationships.<br/><br/>I would say that Inside Out will be enjoyed by teens and adults much more than young children as the story and values are quite complex. I imagine it would still hold the attention of young children as it is extremely colourful with plenty of different characters. However the slap-stick humour is toned down and I found that much of the comedy came from witty one-liners and the metaphors that are used, many of which would be missed by young children.<br/><br/>Personally I didn't find Inside Out to be a 'perfect' movie and I do have a couple of negatives. The scene we see in the trailer where we are shown into other human's brains and seeing how their emotions are stereotyped and interact with each other, was hilarious. I would have loved to have seen more of this to break up the main story which was unfolding in Riley's brain. We see some more shots during the end credits of this but I certainly feel that this concept was underused. The only other negative I have is that around the midpoint of the movie, some aspects started to feel a little repetitive, I won't explain what these are as I don't want to ruin any of the plot but when you watch it I am sure you will understand what I am referring to. <br/><br/>I was left with a very positive message after viewing Inside Out but I won't tell you what it was as it would, again, ruin the movie! I will however say that it was a positive one and in Pixar's usual way, it ended on an emotional note which I imagine would have made many people shed a tear! Overall Inside Out is funny, intelligent, emotional and has a creative, artistic feel to it which was relatable on so many levels. It contained strong metaphors which left me appreciating how clever this movie really was, I would certainly welcome a sequel, the ending certainly gave me the impression that a sequel was on the cards but I have since read that there isn't any plans to create one.<br/><br/>9/10"

","As someone who has been manic-depressive my entire life, an inheritance from the Sherman side of the family, I was delighted to finally see a portrayal of it, particularly of the depressive side, as a condition, not a disease. The spoiler here is that it is depressive side (sadness) which helps Riley find herself. Our depressive side is the root of our greater compassion and sympathy; It is when we are sad that we best hear the sadness of others. Our manic side is the root of our greater energy to solve problems, heedless of the risk to ourselves; it is when we are ecstatic that we dare to end the cause of the sadness of others.<br/><br/>The world needs manic-depressives and would be a far worse place without them. What manic-depressives need more than anything else is family and community to ease the high and lows, but to emphasize that would be to treat manic-depression, not as a disease seeking a cure, but as a condition needing the nurture of a home, as this movie does."

","This film (in addition to the book ""Leaf by Niggle"" written by J.R.R.

Words of anger are exchanged. I can apologize right away and ask for some time to think. When alone I can talk it out in my head. One voice can be ""anger"" & it will say all the things that made it upset. One voice can be ""love"" (my favorite) and it will maybe validate anger in it's feelings YET it will also present the facts in a different light, a perspective not consumed with emotional distress but instead focused on the goal of loving. Maybe a third voice will be objective (""robot""?) and view all the facts and present solutions coming from a base line of who I am as a person and what I really want. Solutions being, how to fix the emotional distress (apologize sincerely?) and present preventative measures to take to avoid troubles of this nature in the future.<br/><br/>I am no psychologist but I know that this helps me to be a more balanced (not more happy/sad/angry) person.<br/><br/>Feelsgoodman ^-^"

","Here is a curious and original idea for a movie concerning the inner workings of the mind. Five core emotions govern the thoughts and actions of each of us throughout our lives. Everyone is subject to the control of the emotions to a lesser or greater degree, depending on which emotion dominates the individual's psyche<br/><br/>For children,generally, the hopelessly optimistic Happiness, or Joy, holds sway. Adults tended to be dominated by the more negative emotions.<br/><br/>The film is about the feelings felt by an 11-year old girl uprooted from her childhood home to San Francisco because of her father's job; how she feels, how she reacts, what happens inside her head. It is a brave idea but is not appreciated by younger viewers, apart from the pretty pictures and colourful characters. I enjoyed it, but felt that the adults should have more than just the five basic emotions. Perhaps Pride, Greed, and Jealousy should have been present, each tempered by their opposite, Humility, Temperance, and Generosity. Maybe this would clutter the control room a little too much, though.<br/><br/>The emotions were perfectly voiced and the animation was impressive, as always from Pixar. It's a good idea for a movie, but it isn't for laughs. The only humour was in the end credits. The preceding short, Lava, was dull."

I was disappointed that only a fraction of the movie was made up of these scenes.<br/><br/>From the moment that Joy and Sadness were sucked into Long Term Memory, I hoped that their problem would easily be resolved, and that we'd be able to see more of headquarters. This didn't happen. Their attempts to get home were thwarted again and again. Just as they seemed to be succeeding, another complication would arise, then another. At first it was moving. Then it was frustrating. Then it was boring. As I realized that the filmmakers didn't plan to bring them back to headquarters until the film was nearly over, I lost interest. The film became a typical quest home, and said barely anything unique about psychology or human nature. It's a shame that Pixar failed to appreciate that what the audience really wanted was to stay in HQ!<br/><br/>The emotional scene at the end of the film may trick you into believing you've seen something good.

Inside Out is one of the most intelligent ideas Pixar (or any filmmaker for that matter) has ever put to screen, and possibly their most accessible film to date. Even when I felt some individual characters in the film begin to cloy, that feeling quickly dissipated, as I was soon blind-sided by their charm only seconds later.

"estebangonzalez10","8","5","26","19 June 2015"," Pixar delivers another emotionally engaging animated wonder
","""Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined Pizza! First the Hawaiians, and now YOU!""<br/><br/>Pixar has always raised the standards for animated films despite their latest weaker entries (Monster University and Cars 2), and fortunately Inside Out lives up to those expectations adding another emotional and moving entry to their long list of successes. Inside Out is inventive and imaginative in the way it portrays the emotional roller coaster that children go through growing up. In Inside Out the main character has to face moving to a new city and experiencing its new surrounding, and director Pete Docter manages to tell that story through the complexities of human emotions which we can all identify with. I did see many young kids get a bit bored and distracted by the emotional buildup of the story, but older kids and adults enjoyed the ride and got emotionally invested with the story (it got a bit dusty in the eye department). Younger kids might love louder films like Home which really don't do anything inventive other than recycle simple gags, but thankfully Pixar goes beyond the easy appeal of those movies and makes intelligent and emotionally engaging animated films that will stick with you. For instance, in Inside Out the different emotions like Anger, Joy, Fear, Sadness, and Disgust are characters that Docter doesn't simply introduce in a thoughtless or general manner to move the story along, instead he takes his time to create a carefully structured brain where these emotions try to guide the twelve year old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias). Docter has taken his time to introduce this world where the brain isn't simply controlled by emotions, but there are other psychological elements involved such as memories, subconsciousness, and dreams. A lot of thought was put into the story and that is something rarely seen nowadays in animated films.<br/><br/>Riley is a twelve year old girl who has recently moved to a new city with her parents (voiced by Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) after her father decides to start a new job in San Francisco. Leaving her friends and love for hockey behind in Minnesota she must learn to adapt to this new place. Her emotions guide her from within the headquarters of her mind, as Joy (Amy Poehler) is doing her best to keep things under control, but Sadness (Phyllis Smith) seems to get the best of her after a series of events seem to conspire against Riley. We are soon introduced to the other emotions in the control room: Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader), and Disgust (Mandy Kaling) who all try to help guide her through the day and forge lasting memories that will shape her. However things take an unexpected turn when both Joy and Sadness get lost somewhere in the deep corridors of Riley's brain and can't seem to find their way back to the control room.<br/><br/>To be honest there were some moments that felt a bit slow and tedious while I didn't find some of the jokes actually funny. However the film has several strong moments that managed to bring me back to the story and by the time we were approaching the final act of the film I was emotionally invested in it. The dream sequence was hilarious and well worth the price of admission alone, but I also enjoyed the time Docter took to tell the story and imagine this world from inside the mind of a twelve year old from a psychological standpoint. It's an inventive movie that doesn't forget about the adventure. I wouldn't rank this as high as some of my favorite work from Pixar (Up, Ratatouille, and Toy Story 3), but it is a huge improvement from the latest entries. It surprisingly doesn't settle for an easy ending either and I was pleased with the resolution. The final act of the movie is perhaps one of the reasons why I'll give Inside Out a higher rating despite not being blown away during most of the film. It will probably grow on me with a rewatch. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","There's a reason Disney/Pixar dominates the critical and commercial market. They are on an incredible run of heart-warming, imaginative, funny, intelligent, and gorgeously animated films. Inside Out is no exception as it attempts to illustrate the trials and tribulations of navigating through childhood.<br/><br/>The story centers around A young girl named Riley, who up until this point has had her childhood memories, thoughts and personality controlled by Joy (one of a handful of emotions brought to life as creatures living inside the child's mind). This all begins to change after Riley is forced to move home, and the stresses of her and her family's new life mean Joy is struggling to keep control over Riley's life as Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear begin to take over.<br/><br/>As with many Disney/Pixar films that try to cater to a wide range of audiences, Inside Out can sometimes feel like about five films in one. However, Pete Docter and his writing team have created such a well rounded screenplay brought to life wonderfully and enthusiastically by a talented voice cast that it all comes together to create a wonderful movie with bucket loads of heart.<br/><br/>I took my 4 year old daughter, and while there was a enough humour and action to keep her interested - the sweet spot for children is within 8-12 years old to get the maximum out of the emotions, story, and relativity. As always, look out for the beautiful Pixar short-movie, 'Lava' to kick-off the experience."

","Inside Out was an animated triumph that will be forever timeless. Pixar has done it again and created yet another animated classic. In this movie we all experience a little fear, a little sadness, a little anger, a little disgust, and of course a little joy. Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) take the helm as the leads in one of Pixar's best. This review is such a hard review to write because everything about this movie was so intricate; so detailed that if I reveal much about the plot, it could give away the entire movie. I will say however that this is one of Pixar's most well thought out movies and that it will influence audiences to come back again and again; this time catching something they didn't the first time. All in all, the movie was definitely what it was advertised to be, an emotional roller coaster that the entire family will enjoy. It was the definition of a Pixar movie!"

","Inside Out, is fantastic! In fact, the general reviewer consensus is that this movie is one of the cleverest and most original films that Pixar, or anyone else has ever made. And yes, I know because one of the most frequent words to praise this film is original, the entire internet is now putting in all their efforts to prove to everyone else that it's not.<br/><br/>Now I know that this is not the first movie, or animation to illustrate personifications of emotions, or internal thought processes; And even as far as Pixar goes, this is hardly the first movie about about two conflicting characters going on a journey in an otherworldly atmosphere. But this is the first time it's been done in a full length family animation with these particular emotions, executed with this level of clever metaphor for the progressing emotional development of a child, so yes, it's still pretty original. Besides, concept is one factor, and execution is another, and in Pixar fashion, it is fine-tuned to a tee to be easily comprehensible, frequently funny, emotionally relatable, with fun and memorable characters.<br/><br/>Inside Out is about the interactions of emotions, inside of a person's head personified as characters. The person in this case, is an 11-year-old girl named Riley; an incredibly happy and well-adjusted child, until her life is completely uprooted, when her family moves to San Francisco. And the movie covers the literally emotional journey that follows. Most of the story takes place inside her mind, and the world the filmakers created to represent the various cerebral functions, is one of the most interesting, engaging aspects of a family movie, that I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Not just in the very likable characters displaying the arguably core emotions, but also how it conveys functions, like long-term memory, personality, dreams, abstract thought, forgetting, subconsciousness, etc. Most of the movie I imagine, you'll be marveling at the incredibly intriguing metaphorical portrayals of these concepts, and also probably thinking about all the extraneous details the film didn't have time to address, like; shouldn't there be some sort of connection between the subconscious, and dream production?<br/><br/>But if there's a single element that showcases the film's brilliant design, with near perfect entertaining execution, it's the emotional characters themselves. You think the characters meant to embody a single emotion would be one-note, but the movie makes it clear that their purpose is not just merely spontaneously reacting to things; The emotions all have motivations to serve a particular need, like fear assesses danger, disgust is her sense of literal and social tastes, and anger protects her from being treated unfairly. They all have very appropriate, and entertaining personalities. <br/><br/>But the true protagonists of the story are joy, and sadness, who are the ones to embark on the journey, to help Riley get through her emotional crisis, after well, causing it. Pixar has this, frankly brilliant habit of telling stories from the point of view of characters meant to represent parents. And joy is right in this wheelhouse, in her caring and her good intentions, but also for her intrusive, perkiness. Along with Amy Polher's performance, the tireless animation, and the writing, Joy was able to work as an intriguingly flawed protagonist, as well as likable, and entertaining. And it's really that ability to make those sorts of characters, under those sorts to conditions likable that really is Pixar's superpower.<br/><br/>Bing Bong was helpful, caring, funny and lovable. Like joy, his success is attributed to the film's execution; culminating with the film's ultimate philosophy about the conflicting relationship between joy and sadness. And by that, I mean the literal relationship between the happy and sad emotions, because the characters, never really connect that much. But then the film's final conclusion is so mutually devastating, uplifting, and accurate, this film would probably become mandatory watching for preteens, even if everything else about it had failed. Overall, this movie was PERFECT."

","My favorite Walt Disney movie of all time is this. The special effects are brilliant, and acting is very good, the plot is really easy to follow. The movie does it so well and so smart. The only word I can describe it is genius, this is a genius movie. I love this energy that all the emotions had in this movie and the movie has a great lesson behind it. I feel like adults are gonna like this movie more than kids because adults are can love how this movie explain emotional states.

","I saw a trailer for this movie months ago and loved the idea - if only they could make it work - said my fear ;) I finally got to watch it today and they totally made it work, this movie is everything I hoped it would be. Very funny for adults and kids alike, smart and kind of ""scientifically accurate"" in a metaphorical way - all of this with that touch of Disney magic, that golden dust they shine on simple stories to make them special. I read some reviews saying this is probably more of a family centered but adult oriented movie, with hints for kids and not the other way around and I must say I don't agree. Although the big picture may only be totally grasped by grownups I feel like it still makes sense for kids and gives them valuable tools to accept and understand their own emotions as well as other's. I find it awesome that in a world where more and more kids live isolated behind screens the animation industry is striving to make everyone feel included and to explain more abstract and social concepts earlier and in more explicit ways. If you like that idea or have a kid who could benefit from this kind of approach I also recommend the movie Home, with the cute purple aliens."
"Turfseer","6","5","27","20 July 2015"," Enjoyable look inside pre-teen's mind also needs a bit more of a malevolent antagonist
","""Inside Out,"" is director and co-writer Pete Docter's Pixar computer animated comedy-drama set primarily inside the brain of a troubled pre-teen, the film's protagonist, Riley. The ""outside"" story begins with a content Riley and her parents moving from their idyllic home in Minnesota to San Francisco where Riley is unable to cope with her new environment, causing havoc inside her conscious mind represented by ""headquarters"" run by her five emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger.<br/><br/>All of Riley's memories are represented by colored orbs which are stored in vast storage areas inside her mind when she falls asleep. However, a set of ""core memories"" are controlled by the emotions via a control console, which power a set of islands (resembling amusement parks) that represent aspects of Riley's personality.<br/><br/>The main conflict emerges between Joy and Sadness, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler as a perky, bundle of energy who seeks to contain Sadness who continually imbues the orbs with a depressing blue hue whenever she touches them. Oddly, Sadness is depicted as a dumpy overweight girl with a passive-aggressive personality—hardly the stuff of true melancholia. Nonetheless the tussle between the two proves to be the welcome comic relief in relation to Riley's depressing circumstances in the ""outside world.""<br/><br/>The plot picks up as we break into Act 2: during a tussle over the creation of one of Riley's new core memories, both Joy and Sadness along with the other core memories, are accidentally ejected out of Riley's ""memory tube,"" into the vast, uncharted wilderness of Riley's mind. The goal is for Joy and Sadness to make it back to headquarters before Riley has a total breakdown (the pre-teen decides to run away after feeling rejected at school).<br/><br/>Meanwhile Riley's ""islands"" are beginning to crumble with Fear, Disgust and Anger left to run the show back at headquarters. Unfortunately the scenarists here are not as successful at assigning distinctive personalities to the three bumbling emotions as they are with Joy and Sadness. I can't remember much about Fear, Disgust and Anger, and due to their lack of distinctiveness, part of the comic potential of the narrative, is lost.<br/><br/>Just like ""Toy Story,"" where a child's companions find themselves far away from ""home,"" Riley's emotions also find themselves struggling to get back to ""headquarters,"" which represent a home base for the pre-teen's emotions. Most of the Act II machinations are food for thought for adults who can revel in all the clever, satirical asides the film's scenarists proffer up. But there's also the neat ""Bing Bong,"" an hybrid elephant-dolphin creature, who aids Joy and Sadness as well as providing comforting grist for the mill for juvenile viewers. The fate of ""Bing Bong,"" however, proves more affecting for adults than kids (he's ends up hero but also the forgotten child playmate consigned to Riley's subconscious, after sacrificing himself for the benefit of Joy and Sadness, in their last chance to make it ""home.""<br/><br/>The rest of Act II consists of a set of clever, satirical asides highlighting different realms of the internal world (there's a ""Land of the Imagination,"" ""Realm of the Abstract,"" and the dark ""Subconscious""). The animators, in particular, get to show off their craft as they depict our protagonists cast about in different dimensions in the Land of the Abstract. The scenarists have their fun with show business mocking the machinations in a dream production factory. There's also a nod to Stephen King, when a sinister Clown ends up running amok. <br/><br/>When Joy and Sadness finally do make it back to headquarters via a ""Train of Thought,"" the perky Joy gives up on her monopoly of feelings and concedes that without some Sadness, their pre-teen charge cannot function effectively. <br/><br/>If ""Inside Out"" suffers from anything, it probably has to do with the lack of singular, compelling antagonist. While Riley's possible breakdown in the real world serves as a compelling force for part of the narrative, Joy and Sadness's conflict only is good for the comic relief. Sadness is more a wayward friend to Joy than a malevolent entity. What might have been more interesting is if Riley had been pitted against a bully at school and we could see how their different minds operated. The closing credits give us the finest moments in the film—there we see the potential for exploring different minds (including the howlingly funny mind of a cat!).<br/><br/>""Inside Out,"" is enjoyable for both kids and adults. The happy ending, where parents and child have their reconciliation, is rather predictable. But there are enough clever ideas, illustrated both visually and through dialogue, which is worth the price of admission."
"invisibulman@aol.com","7","5","27","29 June 2015"," Fantastic movie... for parents
","The storytelling here is absolutely masterful. Inside Out is a well thought out and in depth allegory for the interaction of human emotion. Each and every metaphor used rings so true as to bring tears to your eyes or smiles to your face. Parents will connect with all the feeling they remember of trying times and passions from their youth. <br/><br/>The slight misstep made in this film is that the story assumes a fairly mature comprehension of emotion. It deals with concepts that will not resonate with young children as they have either not experienced or not understood feelings in this manner before. This is not to say the content is inappropriate in any way, simply that it may not connect with the youngest audiences. For parents and school aged kids 8+ this is a wonderful movie. For little tykes, you may find them more engrossed with the Minions movie."
"aciessi","9","5","27","20 June 2015"," Sweet Emotion
","It's time to get emotional. Believe the hype, folks, that this is the best film Pixar has done since ""Toy Story 3"". Take note, other animated movies that pale in comparison, and maybe learn something or two from the master, Pete Doctor. Everything is pitch-perfect here. The four main emotions are so lovable, hilarious and cuddly in their own special ways. Prepare to see these little guys all over the place. What's even more memorable about this picture, is that it's story is so mature, even for a Pixar movie. Adults are going to love this film a lot more than kids. I was howling at some of the jokes, many of which will go WAY over little kid's heads. Inside Out also provides the best casting out of any other film this year. Amy Poehler really blew me away here as a dramatic actress.. seriously. There is so much going for this movie, and you really owe yourselves to see it. Above all, it tells a truly, well-done heartwarming story that makes you appreciate family and the happiest memories of childhood."
"wtmerrett","9","4","20","9 February 2017"," Pixar Has Another Home Run
","I loved this movie and it is definitely not a kids movie. This one is aimed at Mom & Dad. Yes it is an animated film but that is what Pixar does best, or only. The peak into the human mind and seeing each emotion and watching as memories are created and stored is stellar screen writing. The emotions of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear are given life as real characters who steer the young girl Riley, who's life we follow from birth to age 13. It takes great imagination to write a story like this and I applaud Pixar for this one. The scene where the parents are trying to deal with a very sad, angry Riley and the look at what is going on the their heads is downright hilarious. The fathers emotions should dealing with the situation at hand but instead they are all watching imaginary hockey."
"bookreaders2004","9","4","20","24 August 2016"," More than lives up to the hype
","Perhaps the most psychologically complex animated film ever made, this is a huge return to form for Pixar. It's also incredibly fast-moving, funny, and yes, deeply touching, although perhaps not as much as ""Toy Story 3"". The film also does an incredible job of world-building, so much so that one wonders if the film is too complicated for kids, although the gigantic box office would seem to indicate otherwise. Fully deserving of its critical and financial success, this ranks with the very best of Pixar. The film is cast to type: Amy Poehler as Joy (channeling Lesley Nope), Lewis Black as Anger, and they're all superb. A must-see."
"alindsay-al","10","5","28","30 March 2016"," A epic animation that shows pixar still have it
","I have heard rave things about this film and I have finally seen it and wow its pretty brilliant. The premise if the film sees an 11 year old girl made to move to san Francisco. It focuses on the emotions inside her head as they try to keep her life in check. The main emotion is joy played by amy poehler and she is really good. The character is allot of fun and always full of energy, during the film her character really does develop into an interesting character. The rest of the emotions are great as well with sadness, disgust and fear being portrayed very well. But the stand out is definitely anger, he is just so funny and steals the show with how entertaining he is. The story is way deeper then you would expect with the film giving a deep message to children. It also has the fun adventure that children need. The script has allot of great humour that will leave you laughing. But it also has great drama that really makes it a fantastic film. The style is great, with the animation looking really good and allowing the personality of the film to shine. Overall this is a must see for kids and adults alike."

","This movie was absolutely adorable! I went in to this movie a little reserved as I didn't think it would have such a huge meaning, and that it was just going to be another sub-par kids movie. I was wrong! The message in this movie is summed up to: Life is not life with just joy, you need the bad stuff too, i.e anger and sadness. Sadness does touch happy memories and then they become sad because of their age, or how much things have changed. It is just so unbelievably spot on. Plus the comedy had a broad age range so that everyone could enjoy it. I was upset that BingBong had to ""die"" but that's life, things have to be let go, especially things from our childhood."
"CoolJL","9","5","28","29 August 2015"," A wonderful movie for all, including children.
","Pixar is on form again with Inside Out. Reading the reviews here, there seem to be a lot of complains, particularly from parents, that this isn't a children's movie, but if they know anything about Pixar they should know that they never make just ""children's movie"".<br/><br/>The movie makes a very poignant point about how being happy is such a focus in people's life today that we aren't allowed to be sad anymore, to be sad is to become a something of a social outcast. We are bombarded with imagery of being happy, idea of happiness, and everyone seem to be so busy being happy that they don't have time for people who aren't. I think the very idea that it's OK to be sad has struck a discord with many of the parents, complaining that the movie is depressing and not suitable for children. Perhaps the main issue isn't really whether or not the movie is for children, but the discord lies with the fact that the movie goes against the ""Happy idealism"" they hold.<br/><br/>The film works on many levels. I watched it with my two sons, the younger one, who is 5, viewed it mostly as a fabulous adventures of Joy and Sadness getting back to the head quarters to fix all the mess they have created, where as the older one who is 7 did understand some of the issues Riley was having.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie, which deals with a lot of deep issues, yet its funny, very touching at times, wonderfully creative, and being a Pixar movie, it can be enjoyed by all, including children."
"rogerdarlington","Null","5","28","18 August 2015"," A delight for children and adults alike
","This is such a great time for kids' movies that, if you don't have children or grandchildren, you need to borrow or steal a youngster or just go along anyway. For this one, my wife and I were fortunate enough to have her great niece (nine) and great nephew (seven)- thanks, guys.<br/><br/>Children's animation does not come much more inventive and challenging than ""Inside Out"" from Pixar, the studio that gave us ""Toy Story"" and ""Up"", and director/writer Pete Docter, the man who worked on these earlier achievements. Most of the film takes place inside the mind of an 11 year old girl called Riley who is suffering from her parents' move from Minnesota (where Pete Docter grew up) to San Francisco. Her emotions are brought to life by five colourful characters called Joy (yellow), Sadness (blue), Anger (red), Disgust (green) and Fear (purple). The moral of the story is that, for a young person facing a new environment (indeed for all of us), it's tough for Joy to keep all the other emotions in check but it's OK to be sad sometimes.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is a treat: as well as the five emotions battling over the control deck in Riley's mind, there are five Peronality Islands, the Subconscious, the Train of Thought, and endless multi-coloured balls representing memories to be stored, sorted and lost. The brilliance of the film is that there is lots of humour for the kids but plenty to think about for the adults. Its success with both critics and audiences seems certain to augur a sequel based around a mysterious button which has emerged on the control deck called Puberty."

"caelenbailey-709-132889","10","5","28","27 June 2015"," A brilliant film from Pixar, inside and out!
","I'm not going to write any spoilers in this review, as I want this to be read by people who haven't seen the film. <br/><br/>It is a brilliant film, filled with humour, emotion and a great premise. It is more of a film for older children or adults, as young children wont really understand the whole idea of it or what the film is saying.<br/><br/>I am 16 years of age and have been a HUGE fan of Pixar and their unique ability to add a special something to their films. What has always stood out for me is the emotion they put into their films and this is what stands out from other animation companies. They pay so much attention to detail, everything from the beautiful animation (which is superb in 'Inside Out'), along with the script and the perfect voice-casts.<br/><br/>I saw this film in June 19 (the day of its release) with my younger brother and sister and I have to say it is not what I was expecting. I new the plot quite well (after watching all the trailer and clips) and I was expecting it to be quite sad. I wasn't expecting something so emotionally touching however, and this is where 'Inside Out'' succeeds. I was initially shocked by the emotional depth and I even believed it to be very depressing. Due to the fact that I was so shocked the first time, I needed to view it a second time to really know what I felt about the film. After the second viewing, I absolutely loved it! <br/><br/>I admit it is still quite depressing, but it is an amazing film that teaches everyone a lesson and it is Pixar's most mature film yet. You don't need a young child with you to go see this film, but if you do, the dazzling visuals, bright colours and cute characters will entertain them enough.<br/><br/>Each component of the film:<br/><br/>Animation: 9.5/10 (the only thing I could fault about the animation is that certain features of the humans were a bit less-detailed (such as the ears) - but everything else was magnificent).<br/><br/>Voice Cast: 10/10 (the voice cast was amazing! perfect on every level! All of Riley's emotions as well as Bing-Bong were perfectly cast). <br/><br/>Script/Story: 10/10 (The thing that really struck me about this film was how much attention to detail Pixar payed. The story was extremely well structured and the script was beautifully executed. It was just so quick and the script was non-stop. Every word was perfect.<br/><br/>Originality: 9.5/10 (Yes, their have been films that have a similar idea about people or things inside their head that control them, and I have read many reviews that suggest it is a rip-off of 'Herman's Head'. Despite this similarity, Pixar has made the idea their own with a film that is so original that it beats whatever films or television shows have been made in the past about voices in one's head. The ""train of thought"" for example was a component that even had my mother laughing about the sheer inventiveness of it all. <br/><br/>I am happy to say that this is simply a brilliant film by Pixar, and although it doesn't quite beat the emotional impact of 'UP', the originality of 'Monsters , Inc.' and 'Ratatouille', or even the masterpiece that is 'Walle', I could go as far as saying this is one of my favourite Pixar films. I love Pete Doctor, he is my favourite director at Pixar. He is amazing. His films are some of the most emotional ('Monsters, Inc.' and 'UP').<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film! You will never look at emotions the same again!<br/><br/>10/10 (Brilliant film)<br/><br/>Just wanted to add: I have read a review about how it is sexist to men and I'm sorry but that is the stupidest thing I have ever heard! The film uses known clichés and personality traits of a married couple to add humour. And it is true on the most part. Yes maybe you don't have that personality trait, but a lot of males do. The film is not sexist. The male characters are some of the funniest and best, so I don't understand how they are made to be less important or great than the female characters. Anyway go and see the film!! It is not sexist!! It is brilliant! :)"

Anger, Disgust,Fear, Sadness and Joy. All emotions are felt when moving away. You have the fear you wont make new friends. The anger of being uprooted from your comfortable life you have left behind. Your disgust at how different the food is in the new city. Inside the control room Joy and Sadness have been transported to another part of Riley's brain. They are trying to make it back to the control room so Riley can experience Joy and Sadness again. Two emotions we need in every day life. The metaphors for the emotions you go through in life are really well explored here. There are some touching moments. Very funny moments, and scary moments. This is stuff we all go through in everyday life. .Kids will love this film and so will adults. The animation as always with Pixar is amazing. The voices are very well done.

","PLEASE WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY !!!<br/><br/>I've been waiting for this movie for so long, so i decided to watch it first day first show, and it was one of my best animated movie experience. The movie is so interesting that it can easily be enjoyed by adults also.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a little girl named Riley and why she does what she does. So, the concept is that there are these little people, if you may call them that, in everyone's mind which focuses on the mood of the person who's mind they live in. So Riley has Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust and Fear. The film then tell us what happened when Riley's parents suddenly decide to move, but instead of How Riley is dealing with it, we see it inside out, that is, how these small creatures are dealing with it.<br/><br/>The movie is thoroughly entertaining in all its aspects. Some people are arguing that its too complex for a kid's mind but what can they do when people of our age will love it. It contain a lot of perfect pixar moments, like Toy Story 3. It also tell the tale of how kids deal with all the stuff around them, and what is going on in their mind and as i see it, inside out has done this job perfectly. <br/><br/>I liked it instantly because it is funny and then sad but something never seen before. The crew that was behind this movie should really be appreciated for being so original and creative. There were some shots which clearly tell us that the movie makers didn't bother if the shot could be too heartbreaking. They went on with a focus storyline and everything fall into its place. Just like any other pixar movie. <br/><br/>So, please go check it out. I think it has that quality which we once saw in Toy Story."

","Inside Out is a funny, heartwarming, and deep journey into the human mind. Pixar has a filmography that's hard to match, and things will remain that way if they keep putting out films of this caliber. As per usual the story is well crafted, and inventive, but the most impressive thing is the use of humor to help the moments of true drama. By that I mean the film has a relatable humor, that anybody can laugh at and have a good time with, so when the film decides to get serious it hits the audience even deeper. This something Pixar's always been good at, but this movie has some of the most touching moments since Up. On top of the brilliant use of humor, the visuals are stunning, the voice acting is perfect, and the characters are surprisingly well crafted. In the end Inside Out is one of Pixar's best films in the last 5 years, and is worth seeing on the big screen."

","My favorite animation since The Incredibles. Thank you Pixar! I didn't expect this film to be so funny, touching, and deep. The incredible setting of the mind is creative and fun to explore. I love the physical portrayal of the value system, the long-term/short-term memories, the train of thought, the abstract world, the imagination and so much more. There's a lot of visualization of concepts that I thought was really clever. For example, when Riley lost her train of thought, the train to brain control room collapsed in the middle. This film taught me about sadness and how we handle emotions more than I realized. We can see the characters undergo changes as Riley undergo her perfect change. This film is perfect."

"djansen24","10","5","29","13 May 2016"," Not only the best computer animated film, but one of the best films...period!
","Pixar was king of computer animation making great film after great film. They took risks and wrote compelling narratives. It seemed they could do no wrong. But then Toy Story 3 came, still good, but dark and somewhat depressing. Cars 2 was a low point for Pixar, seemingly made to sell more Cars merchandise rather than for a love of filmmaking. Brave was better, but more formulaic. Monsters University was fun, but not on the same level as their masterpieces. Had the mighty Pixar succumbed to profit making over film craft? Were they resigned to turning out product rather than turning out movies?<br/><br/>The answer is a resounding NO! One look at Inside Out reveals not only a studio who continues to love movie making, but a studio at the top of their game, ripe with imagination. What a fabulous movie!<br/><br/>Inside Out is what as known as a ""low stakes"" movie. In the ""real world"" presented in the film, it is about a pre-pubescent girl whose world is shaken by a family move. She suffers depression and runs away from home, only to come back a few hours later to parents who console her. That's it. But that's just the bare plot essence. <br/><br/>What the film is really about is the emotions that run the master control center of her brain, pretty much directly controlling her actions. This film delves deep into psychology. Not just pop psychology, but the science of it. It looks like it was written by people who understood how the human brain functions emotively and the impulses that influence us. It is a complex and multi-layered story with multiple meanings to several pieces of dialogue. While that sounds technical and heady, the whole thing is so tightly constructed that it plays off smoothly and organically. There are some of the most hilarious throw away lines that speak volumes of the way human beings think (mixing up facts and opinions). Some of the character's in the protagonist Riley's head meet tragic ends or suffer, but in the best of Pixar film tradition, we cry because we feel the truth of it. And the happy and sad tears flow freely TOGETHER. <br/><br/>Watching this film is a deeply cathartic experience. There is enough surface action to satisfy younger ones, but so much richness and depth that any adult will love it. This film, in short, makes you feel human. I am astonished with how good of a writer Peter Docteur is. I thought there would be no way he could top his previous film, UP. But here it is: a unique story, a sophisticated story, and above all a deeply moving story! This is simply one of the best films ever made."

","Absolutely loved this film. Sat and watched it with my 10 year old sister. We both laughed, cried and smiled at how wonderful it was. Cant actually believe what utter rubbish people are saying about it giving it 1*... its definitely worth a watch in my opinion, its inspiring and has a lovely plot and morale to it. If you are looking for a family fun film with an inspiring lesson on love then its worth watching with your children. But then I am 20 y/o and I loved it too. I agree with some reviews that maybe having some other emotions in there could have helped but then it may have got too confusing for little children. All in all I am scoring it 10/10 could not complain."

","After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions -- Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness -- conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.<br/><br/>As with many popular, successful movies, this one has caused a great deal of response on the Internet. Many people love it, and it currently (January 2016) sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. And, of course, we begin to get a push back with people calling it overrated, over-hyped, and some even saying it is offensive in its depiction of gender and inappropriate for children.<br/><br/>The path it has followed through award season has had a similar up and down trajectory. Early on, it was seen as the clear winner of the animation Oscar and even in the running for Best Picture. Gradually slipping, it now seems to be 50/50 for animation (up against ""Anomalisa"") with zero chance of getting anywhere near Best Picture. Sorry, Pixar.<br/><br/>As with anything, the reality is never as rosy or as bleak as the Internet would like it to be. ""Inside Out"" may not be Best Picture, but it has a better-than-average chance of landing the animation Oscar. And that is because you rarely get a cartoon that reaches this deep inside its audience. A film about emotions (or lack thereof) that actually makes you feel.<br/><br/>This is not a children's movie. The kids will enjoy the bright colors and characters, especially Bing Bong. And there is nothing ""adult"" in terms of violence, nudity or cursing. (There is one subtle reference to the San Francisco homosexual community, but it is not offensive or derogatory.) This may be the darkest Pixar film yet, thematically. Depression, loneliness, alienation. The adults are the ones who will really appreciate this sad story of change and end of innocence.<br/><br/>Director Pete Docter, who previously made ""Up"", has set the bar high for himself here if he continues making movies (which, of course, he will). He could even have achieved for himself a place alongside John Lasseter in the hall of great animation directors. He assembled this one just right, down to the voices -- Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith are the very embodiment of the emotions they portray.<br/><br/>Although the best animation in recent years remains ""Wreck-It Ralph"", this film clearly has to rank among the finest, giving such movies as ""Ralph"" and ""Toy Story 3"" a run for their money."

","Inside Out is a unique Disney movie that puts the princesses in the dust. If you are someone who doesn't mind a different style of a Disney movie, but with the same thought-felt emotions, this is the movie for you. Inside Out takes you on a crazy adventure of a 11 year old girl named Riley. Different from other movies, this movie you literally see the emotions of a human. We have joy, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust. With these polar opposite emotions, we see a new side of a person. What happens when someone ""pushes your buttons?"" In this movie, you see it all. I think it's a very thought out movie, with our brains becoming the headquarters for our thoughts and emotions. Watch this beautifully animated film and see how Riley's actions affect her emotions, and vice versa. It is a little technical with all the action going on at once, so I'd say teenagers and adults might enjoy this more than children. Whatever genre of film you prefer, this one will surely make you feel all the emotions. See what I did there?"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" (2015) is simply amazing motion picture experience. I do call it motion picture because although it's animated, few animated movies had ever reached the dept and multi-layered story as ""Inside Out"". The story is very simple here, but it's just on a surface. You have to keep your attention during the whole ride and catching all small details, because this movie perfectly shows how does emotions control over human's mind, how one can not exist without another or how joy can co-exist with sadness. ""Inside Out"" has also reminded my ""Inseption"". Altgough on a surface they are very different, down deep both of their stories are based on human conciseness.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Inside Out"" is extremely smart, involving, superbly voiced (""sadness"" voice steals the show), beautifully animated and multi-layered story for young and adults. It is sometimes very funny, with some small but memorable movie inside jokes (aka. ""forget it Jake, this is ""Cloud"" town"") and touching as well. Hands down this is the best Pixar movie in many, many years."
"Screen_Blitz","10","5","29","21 November 2015"," Amazing and thoughtful gift from Pixar
","Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios bring pure imagination and creativity to this delightful family film where the rules of psychology are bent. This film answers the question of what happens when your emotions control you instead of you controlling your emotions. Following the story of eleven-year old Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) who moves with her family to San Francisco from her comfortable life in Minnesota, we experience her emotions going on her head as faces anxiety of her new home, new school, and a whole new life; and her emotions are represented by colored characters including: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is yellow, Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) is blue, Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) is purple, and Disgust (voiced by Mindy Karling) is green. These characters work in an ""industrial"" corporation inside Riley's head that basically controls her emotions and memories as she navigates through life of happiness, despair, and hope. <br/><br/>Inside Out is not your average Pixar movie that many expect. This film is targeted at both children and adults, but at the same time tackles on mature and complex themes that young kids are not too likely to understand well. It takes the rules of how human psychology works and plays around with them, with characters representing a young girl's emotions using an actual electronic console to control the emotions she expresses during her everyday life. The whole concept is a bit complex and enough to make young kids question the reality of psychology. Nonetheless, the idea is astoundingly creative and will definitely entertain kids and adults like; and this movie really explores some amazing things with the idea. Even if kids don't understand some the ideas, they will still find them cute and funny. There are plenty of scenes of laughter as well as some emotional and tear-jerking moments that Pixar films are often known for. <br/><br/>Inside Out is a movie that delivers some of the best taste Pixar has to offer and will bring joy to the whole family. It is very cute, very heartwarming, and filled with some interesting surprises. I should also remind you to sit during the end credits as they offer some fun and interesting scenes."
"Jerghal","7","5","29","23 October 2015"," About emotions but not emotional
","This is a tough one to judge: on one hand I praise Pixar for trying to make a film out of a rather unconventional idea. Monsters (2001) did this too and was also from the same director. I can image it's hard to predict if you can make such an idea into a great movie. Well it turns out it's rather difficult. The biggest problem this movie has is the characters. They are certainly not as good as those in the Toy Story movies, they just don't seem to be as likable even tough Pixar really tries to make you like 'em. What I did like was that the film sometimes felt a bit bleaker and surrealistic (a kind of Alice in Wonderland feel) than most other Pixar flicks. It does seem strange that a film which revolves around emotions struggles a bit with just that as it has difficulty emotionally involving the audience. I certainly don't think it's a bad film, in my book it's still way better than those lame Cars films but it's not in the Pixar top list."

"JPfanatic93","8","5","29","10 October 2015"," It's okay to cry... of joy
","This may be a turning point for Pixar. The naysayers who wrote off the studio ever since Disney took over often seemed right in their sweeping generalizations that Pixar's truly creative days of imaginary wonder where done. Sequels, that's what was in store for the audience ad nauseam. It worked well on Toy Story 3, few will deny. Not so much on Cars 2 though, or even Monsters University. So a new original project was definitely desperately needed to show Pixar has lost none of its dreaming potency, and this is it. Inside Out is as emotional and beautiful, not to mention innovative and soulful an animated movie as they come, and especially as they used to come in this company's own case.<br/><br/>It's not as perfect as the likes of Wall-E or Toy Story 3, I'll have you know, since it has some little flaws. Like Monsters, Inc. and Up, that makes it a classic Peter Docter movie. Those films, too, featured the occasional emotional highs that went coupled with some whimsical additions that had a bit of a trouble fitting in the whole. It was especially vexing in the case of Up, where the movie just never got as powerful as it proved to be in its first act. Inside Out equally knows a few moments where the magic diminishes, most notably when it concerns the elaborate logistics of the brain (though personally I found the forgotten imaginary friend rather an obnoxious sort as well, though I appreciated the notion). Docter has learned something from Up's experience though, saving the emotional climax for the end of the film. And it packs quite a punch, as Docter delivers his message that it's okay to be sad. Quite a rebellious act, since the movie still flies the banner of the Mouse House which usually tells us the exact opposite. While still an undeniably happy end, it's unlikely anybody will restrain their tears. As Docter says they shouldn't.<br/><br/>So is this a definite comeback for Pixar? The list of upcoming projects still consists mostly of sequels, with the only original tale for the foreseeable future presented by The Good Dinosaur. I'm more than a bit skeptical about that one, judging from the first teaser and its overly retro dinosaurs parading through near photo-real landscapes. I doubt an Inside Out 2 is out of the question, considering the film is doing fine at the box office. Still, I like to think the naysayers remain in the wrong, and there's still a few tears of joy to be spilled over Pixar's films in the next few years.<br/><br/>And otherwise we'll still have the shorts preceding the main events. Hopefully they'll be as delightful as Inside Out's Lava, which also gets those eyes wet and thus perfectly warms us up for the main course to follow."
"djaychilds","8","5","29","6 October 2015"," Great movie with surprisingly hilarious moments!
","First off, I rarely ever see animated movies, so the fact that I enjoyed this one as much as I did was surprising. My girlfriend had persuaded me to see it after she saw it a few weeks prior, so I obliged. I had seen the reviews by the critics of the movie so I expected it to be a well made movie, but not something I would get so much enjoyment out of. Several times throughout the film we were both laughing our butts off. Not only were some of the scenes humorous, but they were also really clever in how people really think. The movie's main characters are based on different human emotions, and how they respond to real life situations. It is very interesting to see how each reacts to every situation that comes up during the life of the main girl in the story. I think the makers of the movie did a great job bringing a unique aspect to a story that I hadn't seen done before. Overall it is a great movie for all ages, and if someone you know wants you to see it with them, don't hesitate and you may get a few great laughs that you didn't expect. I give it an 8/10, based on the fact that it would still appeal to a younger audience more, and for re-watch value."

","Okay, so this movie stars Riley and her emotions, Joy Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust and they have to deal with moving from Minnesota to San Francisco, but in her mind, something terrible has happened and Joy and Sadness were sucked up into long term memory, so now it's a race to get back to Head quarters (obvious pun is obvious), before Riley loses all of her personality traits and end up being an emotionless character you would find in an anime (i.e. Yuki Nagato). The moments I really liked from the movie, are Riley's emotions, I mean sure Joy and Sadness are okay, but I'm in love with Disgust, she's my favourite of the 5, even the imaginary friend, Joy and Sadness encounter on their journey was pretty hilarious and oh man the feels. Now, I may be a heartless bastard, but I never cried in this movie, maybe because that I cried so much years ago, or that I'm use to this kind of movie, anyway if there are people who will say that animation is only for kids, then watch this, this movie is one of the best things I've seen in years and they will have their own competition in November with The Good Dinosaur, well, join me there but for now, later."

They enjoyed the cute humor, fun characters, and colorful setting of the movie, and I enjoyed the accurate representation of what a mental illness is really like. While at some parts the movie did drag on a bit and there were many plot holes, as long as you're willing to suspend your disbelief enough, you'll enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is dark. But my god, I am tired of seeing ranting parents who think that they're suddenly great film critics because their kid didn't like it. If it's supposedly ""Too dark for kids to enjoy"", why are the merchandise and toys flying off the shelves? Why is it one of Pixar's highest grossing movies? If your kids can take Frozen and Big Hero 6, they can take Inside Out. Just because it's not Frozen doesn't make it immediately sh*t, parents. But I guess it would be hard to see this movie from all the way up on your high horse.<br/><br/>There are many great points to this film: Amazing character development, good humor that doesn't resort to fart or poop jokes, emotional (no pun intended) score, not resorting to a lame plot twist to keep the viewers interested, accurate representation of depression, etc. However, it has a few weak points too, such as mentioned before: Plot holes, slightly drags on in the middle towards the end, questionable universe inside the mind.

"jerf91","10","5","30","2 December 2015"," Great movie!
","Bear with me. This is not your typical movie review. Oddly enough, my reasons for wanting to review this movie have very little to do with the animation, plot, story, characters, or entertainment value. For me, this movie was a way to give shape to how my emotions and personality function inside of me. Let me explain... I suffer from depression. It's a horrible disease which is really hard to understand sometimes. I'm also a 4th year medical student, so I understand quite a bit about it. The idea that my emotions, thoughts, perception, and image of the world could be completely distorted for no logical reason is something that was very hard for me to come to terms with. While watching this movie, I cried like a baby. But not because of what was happening to the characters. It was because I was finally able to ""SEE"" what was happening to me. My personality was well defined before I first became depressed. However, since then I've felt that I've lost a huge part of who I am, and coming to terms with the new, hopefully only temporarily BROKEN me, scares me more than anything. The ideas in this movie, such as core memories and islands of personality, are completely brilliant! I couldn't have imagined a better way to visually portray what I've battled with during my depression. Like Riley (the main character), an imbalance inside of me which was completely beyond my control and which occurred without my knowledge, led to some of MY islands of personality being lost or destroyed, probably forever. I only realized this for myself when I watched this film. For years I've been trying to somehow put a face to my demons, and Inside Out did this for me. Thanks to this movie, I've gained a sense of hope that I didn't have before. Like Riley, these thing that were happening inside of me were, and still are, were changing everything about me. Yes, Riley moving to a new city made her sad, but that was only the push that started the ball rolling. If her emotions had been in check, she would've been fine. while watching this movie, it is clear that Riley stops being who she really is. She completely changes. She is in now way in any control of her thoughts or emotions. This is exactly what depression does to you. It isn't something you can just snap out of. In the movie, Riley only gets better when her emotions are back in balance. In real life, this would most definitely require some professional help, and possibly medication, but even then, it's always good for the person going through this to somehow understand what's going on inside of them and realize that the solution might be beyond their control. Everyone will either love or hate this movie for their own reasons, but this is mine, and it couldn't be more personal. I love this movie for the ideas and the concepts that it's creators were able to come up with, whether intentional or not. If you've ever felt like your life, your emotions, your thoughts, or who you are have been changing for reasons beyond your control, then watch this movie. Maybe you're like me. Maybe this will help you understand. Maybe, you too can have hope."

","At first sight, I thought this movie was going to be another animation movie like thousands of them but I was completely wrong. What such a fantastic and original movie!<br/><br/>I had to take a little time to get used to each character and their personality. At first, I didn't know what character was talking about, but after that brief moment you'll hooked on the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is about the thoughts and feelings which are inside of the mind of a little 12 years old girl and how these feelings are represented by each one of the characters that appears in the story: anger, joy, sadness, disgust and fear. Each one of these characters has been pretty well represented and characterized being so easy to identify yourself with one of them. You will love it!<br/><br/>The story will take you into different stages, involving each character mentioned above. The movie has everything and you will feel that anger, joy, fear, sadness and disgust of the little girl and her feelings. My recommendation is preparing some Kleenex for the final part of the movie. You will probably need it. It is difficult for me to express what this movie represents. It is completely different to other animation films. Just run to watch it. It deserves each minute. Looking forward to watching the second part of Inside Out! I really hope Walt Disney is working on it!"
"OllieSuave-007","10","5","30","30 August 2015"," An excellent and fun film, inside and out!
","This is a very cool movie from Disney/Pixar about young Riley who moved from her Midwest home to San Francisco, causing her to miss her house, friends, hockey team and school in the Midwest. As a result, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how to best help Riley deal with her new life surroundings.<br/><br/>I thought this movie is very clever, putting the human brain into a whole new perspective. It makes the mind seem like an entirely adventurous and separate world, where memories are formed as orbs or balls and are stored in certain shelves in the mind, and the emotions, who work at ""headquarters,"" power the different islands that form your favorite memories (in this case, Riley has the islands of Hockey, Goofball, Family, Honesty and Friendship). Seeing Riley's emotions will make you kind of relate to her and how you deal with your own feelings. And, it's fun seeing Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness interact with each other. <br/><br/>The screenplay and writing team wrote an imaginative and adventurous script for the movie, letting people see how the human emotions work, guide everyday memories and how they actually need each other, and showcasing what happens when emotions conflict and memories fade. The conscience and the train of thought (literally) were also cleverly depicted. Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen did a great job directing the well-paced film, making you imagine your mind as a different world, and keeping you captivated from start to finish. And, the animation team gave us some colorful and detailed CGI work. <br/><br/>The voice casting did a great job in their respectable characters, delivering a good mixture of humor and heart-felt moments where appropriate. I find myself laughing out loud several times and getting teary-eyed in certain moments as well.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an excellent one from Pixar and it is great for the entire family! <br/><br/>Grade A"

","I could use words such as 'profound' and 'insightful' when describing Inside Out, instead, I would like to share my experience of the movie..<br/><br/>I took my 6 year old son, out of school to watch Inside Out as it was the last showing, in our local movie theatre, and it is not a decision I regret at all.<br/><br/>After having watched this beautifully animated movie together, it has become so much easier to explain all the warring emotions in my little boy's mind.

Well done to the script writers, animators and the cast."
"WilliamOTyler","9","5","30","17 June 2015"," Inside Out Puts Pixar Back On Top!
","Inside Out has really put Pixar back at the top of it's game. It is the company's best movie in years, since Toy Story 3. It follows the 5 main emotions, Joy, Disgust, Anger, Fear and Sadness, inside a little girl named Riley's head as they navigate her through various obstacles, i.e. life. The emotions really dictate the film, and carry it through, making way for scenes where each gets to shine in enjoyable and touching moments.<br/><br/>The voices Riley hears inside her head are lent by some of the best funny people currently out there. This really is an all star cast: Mindy Kaling is a perfect diva as Disgust, Bill Hader is hilariously panic stricken as Fear, Lewis Black is his hotheaded self, yelling out as Anger, Amy Poehler is a complete and honest Joy and Phyllis Smith creates the most brilliant shade of blue as Sadness. Rounding out the cast is another great performance from Richard Kind, as well as a few incredible cameos that you may not recognize until the end credits. This dynamic grouping creates some of the best chemistry a Pixar movie has seen.<br/><br/>The story starts out slow and light and fluffy, with brightly saturated colors and lots of pep and love and great humor. But don't let that fool you. As you grow closer to these characters and what they symbolize, your heart will be tugged on more than one occasion. Take the opening sequence of Up, with it's thorough storytelling through simple imagery that gives just enough information for the moment, and scatter moments like that all throughout the movie. Inside Out is actually written very cleverly. It allows a film that is skewed towards very young audience members to hit a heavy subject and possibly uncomfortable themes, but not in too much of a frightening way.<br/><br/>The film is also clever in its theory and philosophy. The idea of how emotions and thoughts and imagination works and how they all interact and coexist with each other in a world within our brain is fun. How all of those instances and internal interactions effect us outwardly is also important, and could be something very hard to get a handle on. Here, Pixar manages to create a solid foundation for all of this, while still being able to actually remain abstract enough to allow for almost anything to happen. And it all happens to a brilliant mood swing of a soundtrack by Michael Giacchino.<br/><br/>Everything presented here is completely accessible and relatable, on both a large general scale as well as one small and personal. Kids and adults will both be able to understand and sympathize with these characters, and what goes on inside and outside of our heads. We all go though life in this way, whether we have realized it before now or not. But seeing how it actually plays out and the thought process behind it is an absolute wonder. It's a hockey puck that Pixar knocks right into the goal."
"picassomanhdan","6","4","22","10 September 2016"," Yet another overrated production
","Inside out: yet another overrated production Little am I impressed by Inside Out. An ordinate amount of acclaim has been unwisely put in such an average animation like this.<br/><br/>The concept art of the whole animation deserves a humble degree of my fondness. Too plain as it is, the whole concept revolves about geometric shapes and man-made objects. If this is an approach to render the film more accessible to the younger audience, it is at its own cost of making it too artificial, losing touch with organic shapes and natural elements. One's brain is depicted as a kingdom, with the headquarter filled with curvy interior design of a flamboyant palette. I simply have a slight detestation for it. To aggravate this matter, everything else in the realm of one's mind is designed similarly. I wouldn't dare to judge the animators' creativity but rather say it's not my taste.<br/><br/>Regarding the character design, it was only fine. Though I'm quite disappointed that Joy is modelled similar to Tinker Bell; is it really demanding to covet a novel depiction of character? And there's a discrepancy that Riley's Anger is a male, while others are consistent with the host's gender. It's utterly reasonable attribute this to the laziness to have the convenience and the ease of illustrating contrasting human personalities via gender.<br/><br/>The plot is barely average. How many times have we encountered a work whereby the child gets fed up with the family and leaves? Never would I attempt to discredit the effectiveness of such a motif, but in an age like this why would the taste of the general population be still favourable of this antiquated concept? I don't think I'm the only who is bored by this style of constructing the climax and resolution. <br/><br/>No amount of derision of mine would suffice to highlight how misleading the story line is. Before getting to the main message, some analytical ink ought to be spilled over the interpretation of some key rising actions. Riley's psyche starts to be on a slippery slope when Joy got lost out of the headquarter. And the triggering intent for this is Joy being adamant not to let the Core Memory be contaminated with sadness. This implies that the transformation of Riley's mental state is purely reliant on internal factors, not external. Although this fallacy may past the eyes of several viewers as it seems to fit the story line, it doesn't add up. <br/><br/>The opponent may rebut by saying that external factors (Riley's occasions of sadness) stimulates Joy to be more alert of the state of happiness of her host. Well, I totally disagree with this. Sadness contaminated the memory marbles without any definite intents: the key driving force of Joy's excessive amount of alert is Sadness' nebulous acts of touching the memories, which is merely coincidental with regards to the plot.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the escalation of the story line boils down to Sadness' puzzling desire to touch the marbles. I don't find it convincing to attribute this to Sadness' wish to be held inclusive, since Joy appears to dominate the control of Ridley and be leaving out of Sadness. Possibly, Sadness is a complete hypocrite as the immediate response she gives Joy when the marble is seen contaminated is always that ""I'm sorry,"" while still persists on this apologetic act. <br/><br/>The ultimate message is brilliant, though: emotions are not exclusive, but rather an amalgam. Moreover, the subtle meaning when Joy realises the significance of Sadness is about mutual understanding, which is the prerequisite for inclusivity.<br/><br/>However, the urge to express disapproval for the notion that sadness is essential for sympathy is one that I can't resist. It's the willingness to be emotionally naked, to let all the insecurities be exposed that sympathy is cultivated on.

","It's just a kids movie guys, seriously! A reviewer said that this movie doesn't tackle complex mindsets, like the ""ego ideal"" or ""pragmatist vs narcissist"". Um HELLO? The filmmakers HAVE to dumb it down because it's for kids! As long as the kids like it, that's all that matters! Are we really going to expect complexity from Pixar?<br/><br/>The best part about Pixar, is taking SIMPLE concepts, and making them into masterpieces. And besides, there are many more kids movies that deserve more hate than they get! I thought this movie was a MASTERPIECE like a lot of other Pixar movies.<br/><br/>Besides even if you do hate this movie, even Disney has made some terrible movies in the past, like Chicken Little, Home on the Range, and Mulan 2!<br/><br/>If you are expecting character development, and fleshed out characters, take your stupid hate reviews somewhere else, because this movie is perfect!<br/><br/>Remember this: It's just a kids movie!

","Before any further delay, I can officially write by saying that 'Inside Out' is a flat-out MASTERPIECE! Its heartwarming & heartbreaking & narrates our childhood with relentless realism. I laughed, I cried & I was overwhelmed. <br/><br/>'Inside Out' Synopsis: After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school.<br/><br/>'Inside Out' is about us. The emotions that we have. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust & Fear (all of whom are voiced here as primary characters), are the emotions that eventually make us who we are. We all have that one imaginary friend, whom we let go when we grow up, we all hit puberty & we all try to understand the present. 'Inside Out' narrates Riley's story with mesmerizing strength & the connectivity I had while the story progressed, left me spell-bound.<br/><br/>Pete Docter & Ronnie del Carmenbound's Screenplay is Masterful. The Writing is so real & so imaginative, that I wondered how did they even achieve this near impossible task. Pete Docter's Direction is exemplary & with the recent Oscar-Win for Best Animated Feature, just proves its merit & beyond.<br/><br/>'Inside Out' is filled with exceptional vocal performances. Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as Disgust, Kaitlyn Dias as Riley Andersen & Richard Kind as Bing Bong, add extraordinary depth to their respective roles. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Inside Out' is about us & it nails every nuance of whom we are. This one's a Milestone in modern storytelling."

","I'd give this an 11/10 but IMDb will only let me go to 10. Anyways this movie is beyond words. It is beautiful, complex, emotional, devastating and so much more. You need to see this film. The emotions as characters are incredible and the way the filmmakers portrayed different parts of the mind are wonderfully imaginative. Watching these parts of the mind shape Riley and who she is is stunning as you can't help but think of how your emotions shape you. Now the film does have one fault I've been able to identify. I can't watch it again, it's too much emotionally, I cried twice during my first viewing and even watching the most emotional scenes again on YouTube tears me apart inside. Easily the best animated film I've ever seen and quite possibly the greatest film I've ever seen. Period.<br/><br/>11/10 My #1 of 2015, and tied for my #1 of all time"

","First, I loved Inside Out too: at last Pixar made another beloved animated masterpiece (even if, I admit it, I liked also Cars 2, Brave and the so underrated Monsters University), with a brilliant idea developed in the more awesome ways imaginable. After Monsters, Inc. and Up, Pete Docter Animation wonderful as always. Technically impeccable: impossible not to mention Ren Klyce's sound mixing and the faithful Michael Giacchino's new amazing original score. And the characters? I've loved all of them! Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger... Uncle Walt himself would have loved them just like his cute Seven Dwarfs!! But what makes me happier is also the 3D: finally those glasses make us live an amazing experience more than we could have imagined.

","This was a good film. I think it's more for adults than kids. The movie creates personalities in this girl's mind. They are joy, fear, disgust, anger, and sadness. And these 4 control her actions and feelings. She moves to San Fransico and is OK with it at first. Then joy and sadness get sucked out of the control tower, so without joy, she can no longer be happy. So the middle of the film is about those 2 trying to get back and meanwhile the girl is mad because anger takes control. After joy and sadness overcome many obstacles to get back, they stop the girl from running away.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's just a cute film. Check it out."
"StevePulaski","9","5","32","16 June 2015"," A culmination of an animation studio's two decades of sheer brilliance
","Pixar's ""Inside Out"" may be the most heartfelt and morally honest film the renowned animated studio has made in their now two decades of operation. This film is an all-encompassing testament to the animated studio's ability to please audiences of all ages, innovate new designs and atmospheres to their already immaculately detailed environments, explore uncharted realms in the field, and give people a film that seriously makes them look at themselves introspectively. This is more than a film people, kids and parents, will want to see, but a film they will need to see.<br/><br/>This is a film that's far easier to watch than it is to explain. We are greeted with Riley Anderson (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), a spunky eleven-year-old who loves hockey but is undergoing a move from Minnesota to San Francisco that will drastically change her life. She'll have to make new friends, adjust to a new environment, and really attempt to fit in, as she's entering a very tumultuous time in life.<br/><br/>This will obviously cause an emotional roller-coaster for her, which is why we spend most of our time inside Riley's mind, where we meet her emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) is her most prominent emotion, commanding the headquarters of Riley's mind so that she is the happy, cheerful little girl we always see. Riley's supporting emotions are Sadness (Phyllis), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), all of whom chiming in at one point or another, but with Joy frequently commanding the ride. However, when Sadness causes a serious accident, resulting in the loss of Riley's core memories, Sadness and Joy, along with the core memories, are subsequently sucked into the subconscious mind of Riley. Here, Riley cannot access her memories of Sadness and Joy, nor her core memories, leaving her with the inability to express any emotion besides fear, anger, and disgust.<br/><br/>As a result, Sadness and Joy must work their way back to the headquarters of Riley's mind, a task that need be completed soon or every defining asset of Riley cherishes, be it hockey, her family, or her goofy side, will crumble, leaving her an empty shell of a human with the inability to feel.<br/><br/>As a reminder, ""Inside Out"" is not nearly this confusing to follow. In fact, it's rather amazing how writer/director Pete Docter (""Monster's Inc,"" ""Up"") and the remaining screen writing team of Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley make this film so easily accessible to kids. Kids will instantly recognize the playfulness of the emotions controlling Riley's mind, and, presumably as a result, consider how their own emotions impact them on a daily basis. The incredible cast of voice actors shouldn't go unnoticed, as they're essentially playing the bare basics of characters by predicating themselves on one core emotion. However, surprisingly so, one of the most memorable and heartfelt characters isn't an emotion, but Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's imaginary friend who guides Sadness and Joy through the different depths of Riley's mind. Kind voices Bing Bong with a potent sense of happiness and sadness, making him one of the most sympathetic animated characters in recent memories. As Poehler describes him in a Q&A, his character is like a vaudeville actor pining to prove himself during one last performance.<br/><br/>It's redundant to continue to praise Pixar's exquisitely detailed visual effects, so let's focus on the meatier aspects of ""Inside Out,"" like its emotional relevance with its audience. This is the very definition of a crowdpleasing film. We can all recall a time when our emotions got the best of us and we said things we didn't mean, or recall when our emotions were so indescribable we could barely think straight. It also houses the valuable lesson that, in order for a mind to fully operate, every emotion must play a part (a rude but necessary awakening for Joy). ""Inside Out"" makes you imagine this sort of scenario going on in your own head by not only focusing on Riley's mind but flawlessly segwaying the story to show how the minds of others work (the scene during the end credits is comedic gold in terms of carrying this idea to the fullest). Furthermore, so many elements had to be considered for this kind of film, such as portraying the emotions of the five main emotions, as well as making their personalities likable despite the emotions they're representing. Docter, LeFauve, and Cooley handle this in an incredibly dignified manner.<br/><br/>The only thing burdening ""Inside Out,"" ultimately, is its lack of emotional subtlety. When you're making a motion picture revolving so blatantly around emotions (or, as the tagline cleverly puts it, a ""major emotion picture""), you're going to have a film that leaves few emotions unexploited. With ""Inside Out,"" while it doesn't crank up the mawkishness to cloying levels, it does inevitably leave the film dictating your own emotions while you watch the film. Yet, this isn't as big of a problem as it should be, mainly because rather than amplifying pathos, the trio of writers are more compelled with trying to craft an innovative and unique movie-going/moviewatching experience for the audience, which is evident with nearly every frame in the film.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" is a culmination of a craft Pixar has held for two decades, which have been filled with ostensibly everything active imaginations and incorruptible creativity can conjure up. The fact that they'll likely continue down this path, despite ostensibly making one idea that's better than the next, is something that will almost always leave me excited."

","This is not the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>But it is, without question, one of the most innovative and creative.<br/><br/>Early on I wasn't particularly impressed. But as it developed - and it most definitely developed, it didn't just move along - it became truly interesting.<br/><br/>I can't imagine what a 10 year old child would get out of this movie.<br/><br/>But as a 64 year old man who sees some of his memories start to vanish like that pink elephant that even joy cannot save, I found its meditation on the importance of core memories - and the problems when they are lost - to be deeply moving.<br/><br/>One of the very best things about this movie is that the issues are not discussed to death. Sometimes you just have to draw your own conclusions from what happens. The I's are not all dotted and the T's are not all crossed. It's really a movie made for intelligent adults. If children enjoy it, so much the better."

","In 1995 a man named John Lasetter opened another animated company called Pixar. Their first was Toy Story and since then Pixar has had some hits and some misses. But in 2015 marking their 15th animated film and 20 years in history making animated movies comes this enjoyable feel good film that deals with emotions.<br/><br/>The film tells the tale of a young girl named Riley,an 11 year old who has to move to San Francisco as her father has a big promotion there and Riley has no choice but to move from Minnesota to San Francisco. The beginning of the film we see Riley as a baby and we are introduced to Joy(Amy Poelher)who is Riley's first emotion that she received since she was born. Later we see other emotions coming to play such as Anger,Fear,Disgust and of course Sadness. Together Riley's emotions help her through everyday life and once Riley's day is done new core memories come to play as well as new worlds such as Goofy Land,Family Land,Honesty Land and so on. But when Sadness accidentally makes one of Riley's dreams sad,both Sadness and Joy get sucked out of their headquarters leaving Anger,Fear and Disgust to help Riley out in her everyday life like her new hometown and help her make new friends. But will Joy and Sadness get back to the headquarters before its too late with a little helping hand from Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong?<br/><br/>Throughout this film Riley gets angry,sad,disgusted and frightened about San Francisco she even at one point of the film steal her mother's credit card and run away thanks to Anger who hated the idea of Riley moving to San Francisco.<br/><br/>Overall what did I think of this movie,well surprisingly I have to admit it but its a far more superior movie than Minions. The story was brilliantly executed,the animation was flawless,the characters were very well written and the voice cast was very very good as I had no idea who was voicing who? Bottom line I highly recommend this film to an older audience who will appreciate this film more so than younger kids. My brother,my mom and myself all went to see this in 3D yesterday and I think I enjoyed it more than my mother who said it was alright,and my brother thought it was good but he liked the Minions more. As for me I thought it was better than the Minions.<br/><br/>Oh and make sure you arrive on time as there is a short called Lava which was very stupid to be honest with ya,as its about a singing Volcano who sings about Lava and falls for another volcano.<br/><br/>Keep an ear open for a certain YouTuber who sings Triple Dent Gum. All I gotta say is he works for Pixar Animation and can sing like a girl and a boy. <br/><br/>Verdict: Pixar's best animated film in a long time.<br/><br/>9.0/10<br/><br/>4.5 stars<br/><br/>Brilliant,best animated film I have seen since Big Hero 6."
"HillstreetBunz","8","4","24","27 July 2015"," Astonishingly imaginative and quite beautiful to behold
","Perhaps all children imagine themselves as machines managed internally by various mini engineers? I know I did, helped along by the ' Numbskulls' comic strip in my 'Beezer', 'Topper' or 'Whizzer and Chips' comics back in the 60s and 70s! In any case the latest Disney/Pixar effort proves the enduring appeal of this childhood conceit and affirms the greatness of the imagineers behind the now singular studio. Imagination runs riot as we explore the emotional development of a human girl, the early scenes give insight not just to the plot of the movie itself, but also into the flight of imagination that the imagineers are going to take us on during the next 90 minutes. At times the pictures are gorgeously beautiful and the thought behind them so detailed and finalised ...... the way the 'Emotions/characters' have fuzzy almost gaseous edges, reminding me of the nature of life at such high resolution is a stroke of pure genius! Credit to producers who grounded the films leading cipher (Riley, the little girl in whose head we journey) in a modern reality far from the Disney princess model, but who resisted the urge to reference ephemeral cultural memes (making the movie more likely to survive being 'dated' and less narrowly culturally American, than it might otherwise have been (and some other recent similar releases have been). The psychological development rationale for the characters journeys to 'HQ' are sometimes a little convoluted and not followed through, and in the second half of the movie this could lead to disengagement with the plot and the emotional heart line. But the pay off at the end is as warm and touching as one might hope and has come to expect from the imagineers, so all is well. Positioned well for a sequel (and after Toy Story 4, why not?) it's a ride I would take again and again. Beautiful, warm, touching and potentially timeless."
"just_for_movies","9","4","24","26 July 2015"," Amazing movie with a great concept and beautiful animation
","Inside Out is Pixar Studio's latest animated offering and it may be their best yet. Pixar has given us great movies like Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Up, and Wall-E and while those movies were all quite good, Inside Out is possibly their most original and interesting concept yet. Not only does it have beautiful animation, but it also has a fascinating story. It focuses on the human brain and our emotions which is a very complicated subject, but the movie makes it so bright and easy to understand that even little kids could get it.<br/><br/>It is a Pixar movie so naturally, Inside Out has rich and colorful animation. The colors were bursting and even for an animated movie, the cinematography was excellent. I really believed in all the characters and locations, partly thanks to the wonderful animation.<br/><br/>Even if it is just their voices, the cast was great in their roles. Each actor or actress fit their role very well especially the characters of the emotions.<br/><br/>The story/plot is the real standout of this movie. It is a brilliant realization of how our emotions work inside our brains. This is a very complex subject, one that scientists have been working on for many years. Inside Out brings a new perspective to the screen with many new ideas. It blows my mind how the filmmakers were able to come up with such an intricate design of the human brain what with our emotions being characters or long term memory being like a huge maze in our brain. There are so many little clever things in Inside Out that really makes you change your perspective on how the mind works. The story itself is much like an adventure as it focuses on the mind of an eleven year old girl and the difficulties of that age. While she is going on an emotional adventure in the real world, the characters of the emotions are going on an adventure in her mind which makes for some interesting storytelling.<br/><br/>In the end, Inside Out is a very clever film with great animation and music. The actors/actresses do a fine job voicing their parts and the directors really bring the world inside the movie to life. Above all else, the concept and design of the whole movie is amazing. The story is rich with adventure and some good humor. This a brilliantly crafted movie and certainly is another Pixar classic. It might even be their best and inventive idea yet."

","Some movies bring out the child inside us. Doesn't matter if you are 9, 23 or 49 we all like to forget our daily struggle and be transferred into the world of make believe. It is even better when after the ending of the film we are still emotionally invested with the characters we saw on the screen. It is mind blowing however when these characters are animated and the movie is the 15th feature film of the company known for their excellence in delivering deep enjoyable animated films, which in some way became the benchmark of animation around the world. Pixar as a team, truly outdid themselves this time creating arguably one of their best feature films with ""INSIDE OUT"". With a blend of education and entertainment they created truly enjoyable experience which lasts much longer after the initial viewing. The premise is very simple and the actual plot can be easily explained with a so called ""elevator pitch"". ""After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school."" Under this simple premise a deeper complex psychological story is hidden in plane sight. In fact this film might be the most deep and sometime darkest of Pixar's creations, because it deals with the human psychology and emotions which occur in us all. By lowering the count from the original 27 emotions and keeping the choice to 5, using, Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness, Pixar's team created very clear pattern of behavior where our characters operate. This story has two dimensionality because it takes place in normal life and inside our protagonist head. The stimuli of her life experiences are translated towards which emotions are dominating at the particular time. I do not want to give away to much in terms of the twists and turn of the plot, but I can insure you, you will laugh out loud and certainly share a tear or two. The characters created here are extremely endearing and in fact this story does not have really an antagonist. It could be argued that the antagonist in ""INSIDE OUT"" is the environment which becomes the catalysator that starts the change in Ridley's life. Her memories are changing and she in some way moves on to another chapter in her life that is much more mature. The most important moral of this story is that it is OK to be sad and sometimes all human being needs is to have a good cry that releases those inner emotions that are bottled up inside us. After we do that, we feel a sense of peace and calm. All the voice-over actors do a splendid job in adding the extra layer of believability to wonderfully detailed CGI animations giving them much needed soul. As I mentioned before it is a very simple story and yet the execution is of an epic proportions. Pixar's ability to entertain us and sometimes move us to tears is second to non. This is truly one of the best feature films they created and it has been made with only half of the normal team. The production design took 5 years to be prepared therefor there is nothing random here. Everything has it's psychological backing which ads to the masterful, meticulous way this film has been created with. If you have little kids then take them to see ""INSIDE OUT"" it's a no brainer. If you are not a child no more, but you would like to be brought back in to your childhood, there is no better movie this summer to accomplish that then ""INSIDE OUT"". I already heard some rumors that this film might be nominated for an Oscar in the category of a Best Picture and why not. This amount of entertainment, depth and psychological education deserves the highest praise. I guaranty you will love ""INSIDE OUT"". Go and check it out in 3D."

","Good lord, people love Pixar. The theaters in town were packed with poor souls with twenty seven kids, grown men without kids and us taking our 5 year old Daughter to the movies. Whats more intriguing is every kid in a packed audience shutting up from start to finish. Grown people don't even do that. (They should though, you know who you are)<br/><br/>That says something. When Pixar nails it, they really nail it and with Inside Out, they nailed it. It starts off hitting you in the face with emotional Mike Tyson uppercuts and ear bites. It may help that I'm a dad to a little girl but hey, we were all little girls once. Or uh, little kids once. <br/><br/>Watching this little girl go through the tough times of life is heart wrenching. It's a great reminder of how devastatingly the outside world can effect the little ones. The originality displayed in how they crafted her mind to really project the many emotions and layers of a human psyche is truly impressive. <br/><br/>Inside Out really shines when they show the correlation to whats going on in the outside world & how it effects the mind and body. Seeing the Parents efforts truly change the course of a life in mere moments is some heavy stuff. The whole middle act however?<br/><br/>Things become less touching and innovative and lend to a more adventure-ish ""gotta get from point A to point B before C happens"" race when some of the emotions go haywire and have to find their way back. From here we spend a lot of our time inside the mind and imagination. Things becomes more Magic School Bus than truly breakthrough for a while and hey, that's OK. Magic School Bus was awesome. But things did get a bit average in the middle acts.<br/><br/>The ending brings back the correlation to real world and with it come the tears and emotions. As well as breakthrough ideas and originality. You can't help but watch and wonder the many, many places they could go with this idea. The well of emotions, stages of life, different types of people......it's an endless, genius idea. But what makes Inside Out work isn't this idea alone. We really care about this kid and her parents and we relate to their joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness.<br/><br/>No really, I had man tears. 8/10"
"saraalqanas","10","5","33","3 June 2016"," Depth and Control.
","Inside out is an excellent movie, which isn't like many others. The movie features great examples of the impact emotions have on the youth. Certain scenes seemed so simple yet it had a deep meaning. The moment with Riley on the bus, where she realizes she's making a mistake, gives a deep feeling of acting in moments of anger and doing things without thinking and later regretting it, which goes along with fear. Also, the colors correlate with how the movie makes you feel. When sadness touched the memories and things went wrong, the colors changed from light and bright, to icy, blue, dark. <br/><br/>Furthermore,Riley was pretty relatable. there were things that remind people of what their childhood was like. The scene with Riley being sad over happy memories, wanting to go back to the happy place, feeling sad when you miss things, those feelings hit really close to home.<br/><br/>When you observe the emotions, you seem to realize sadness connects to some aspects of depression and fear connects to anxiety. People who grew up with negative mental development can see that Riley might have those two things. The way anger reacts without thinking shows how Riley can have an issue with impulse control. Joy having her hopes up and being let down shows how Riley begins to have lower expectations later on. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who understand these problems and have dealt with them. The point of the movie seems to be presenting feelings and dealing with growing up. The character development shows that Riley understands her feelings later on and works on controlling them. <br/><br/>The parents' short seconds of inside of their heads shows that they knew how to control their emotions, they didn't seem to have the same issues as Riley considering they are adults. It seems that Riley is experiencing maturity and learning to be controlling of herself, which is part of growing up and learning to make the right choices. She hasn't made perfect decisions but she later learned from her mistakes. <br/><br/>Other than the subject of maturity and learning, Riley also seems to see what it's like to be in a new place you don't want to be. She moved to a new city with a new house and she had a hard time adjusting. Adjustment problems seem to run with not trying to adjust, but only thinking about what you want and what you had. Seeing this, its telling you to learn to adjust to new things, the past is in the past.<br/><br/>My favorite part was the childhood scenes. She still has some things from when she was younger in her head, like the imaginary friend. It shows that when you get older, some things can go further away in your mind, but they will always be a part of you. <br/><br/>Aside from what is negative and positive, the end of the movie shows Riley coming across a boy who seems to like her, which was some comic relief after all the dramatic events occurred.<br/><br/>This movie is a great example of showing mind development, control, and depth. You see Riley change for the better over time, you see Riley learning to control her feelings, and you see Riley learning to understand instead of just reacting. 10/10."

","Toy Story...Wall-E...Up...Finding Nemo...etc. When a company (Pixar) makes films of that caliber, it is a difficult task to keep ""upping the ante"" with subsequent releases. While ""Inside Out"" is (at the very least) entertaining, it doesn't quite live up to the bar of greatness set by previous Pixar installments.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Inside Out"" tells the story of an 11-year old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), who is moving from Minnesota to San Francisco. This is obviously a big change in Riley's life, and it is when we are introduced to the emotions inside her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), & Disgust (Mindy Kaling). All of Riley's outward emotions are controlled by these core emotions in the ""command center"" of her brain. As Riley struggles to acclimate to her new home, school, and environment, these emotions struggle to figure out their place in the overall scheme of her personality.<br/><br/>The concept behind ""Inside Out"" is original and entertaining. It's fun/interesting to see our emotions represented like that, and it provides for both some very happy/uplifting, as well as very sad/depressing, moments throughout. In terms of original concept and interesting ideas, ""Inside Out"" may actually be one of Pixar's best.<br/><br/>However, I found the execution of those ideas to be only so-so. I had two complaints (this is coming from an adult perspective, of course) while watching the movie...<br/><br/>1. When the camera ""pulls back"" to see Riley interacting with her parents and environment, that is when this film works the best. However, a majority of the film is spent inside Riley's brain dealing with the emotions themselves. For example, a subplot involving Joy being separated from the command center takes up quite a bit of time. I just wish things could have been a bit more balanced.<br/><br/>2. More so than any other Pixar film, ""Inside Out"" seems to really ""go for the cry"", so to speak. I've never been in a theater where so many sniffles and even outright sobbing could be heard. I have no problem with that at face value, as great films are supposed to grab at the emotions, but this one just felt expressly made to do so. I shed some tears at the end of ""Toy Story 3"" and at the beginning of ""Up"", but I really feel that was because those montages were so well-made and natural to the plot of those films. With ""Inside Out"", at times I felt like the entire point of the experience was to have parents bawling.<br/><br/>That being said, even though this one didn't rank as high as other Pixar efforts in my book, it was still fun to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique concept and really liked the parts where the emotions in Riley's (and her parents') brain directly influence conversations and interactions in the real world. Highly recommended for all audiences and (as usual) perfect for families. But be warned: if you are a parent, you might want to keep a few tissues handy."

","At the age of 18, the transition from a girl to an adult, I can totally understand Riley's feeling and experience. As Riley grows up, the difficulties and frustrations come to her life waves after waves, making her happy memories gradually become sorrow. Everybody has obstacles and changes that must conquer by him/herself, but it is hurt and difficult especially for a sensitive teenage girl, so does Riley. Feeling depressed and lacking strength to change the present better, she starts to do something defiant and gradually become aloof from her family, which somebody call it the rebellious stage. To my opinions, patents shouldn't take it as their excuse and do nothing. They should pay more attention to their children's emotions and guide them how to act more mature and how to deal with those unpleasant feeling instead of feeling disappointed about children's disorder behavior. It really is a thought-provoking movie!!"

","I went to see this my two children 5 and 3 and was not expecting much given the complexity of how to portray emotions but Pixar have done a brilliant job of this. I thought the story was beautifully told and moved along nicely. I found it a very emotional film especially with my kids sat next to me so be prepared with the tissues! <br/><br/>The only thing I would say it that my two kids didn't overly enjoy it, I think the concept was a bit too much for them at their ages(they are more goofball island!) but I think over 6's will love it and adults will really relate to what is happening in the story especially if they have kids! All in all a very good film."
"studioAT","7","4","25","20 August 2015"," A good film. Inside and out
","Despite the good reviews I was a little unsure of whether I would like 'Inside Out' going into the cinema. I mean, a film about the emotions in a little girls head, how funny could that be? I am pleased to say that I was wrong. Not only is 'Inside Out' a funny film but it is also incredibly moving, with some real moments of heart.<br/><br/>What I love about Pixar films at their best is that they don't talk down to kids. 'Inside Out' is actually a really complex film, but there are enough big moments to keep both kids and adults engaged throughout the film's running time.<br/><br/>Having been slightly underwhelmed by 'Ratatouille', 'Brave' and 'Cars', I'm pleased that Pixar are back on form."

","What have I forgotten? what memories do I have lost? what were my memories when I was a kid? was happened to the thoughts and dreams I had? and the creatures I build in my mind? and...<br/><br/>Thanks again to a Pixar movie, I left the theater not thinking only about the movie itself, but about stuff that I had in mind. The bottom line is an amazing point: do not forget who you are, what makes you what you are, and embrace the complexity of feeling alive. Enjoy it; enjoy sadness, joy, because the mixture of emotions is what makes you ""you"".<br/><br/>And I have to add that for a second I thought there was going to be an evil character; someone making things go wrong, a villain. But there are no one. There is no evil, no fights, no wrong side. There is only confusion, and a plain tale about what is the meaning of growing up. <br/><br/>It's a nice story. It's funny. It's touching. Is it perfect? no. But it's close.<br/><br/>Well, OK, if you ask what are the wrongs; I did not feel touched by the music as in Up. I wish it lasted longer, so they could develop more the rest of the emotions. I wish I could have seen more of the universe within Raley's brain.<br/><br/>What are the thumbs up?; I wanna remember my memories more than ever.<br/><br/>Beat that."
"bryank-04844","8","4","25","27 July 2015"," It's safe to say that Pixar is back on top again with 'Inside Out'.
","I'm a huge fan of Pixar and their animated films. They have changed the way films are made, and each movie since 'Toy Story 1' in 1995 has been a success both critically and financially, making Pixar one of the biggest movie studios ever. Hell, all of the Pixar films combined have made over $9 billion (with a ""B"") at the box office. That's not to mention home video or merchandising sales. Since 'Toy Story III' in 2010, there has only been three Pixar movies, all of which have been less favored to Pixar's previous films including 'Wall-E', 'Up', and the third 'Toy Story' movie.<br/><br/>With 'Cars 2', 'Brave', and 'Monster's University', the story lines and general excitement were muddled and less than stellar. It seemed like Pixar mostly phoned it in, trying to capitalize on toy sales or the laziness of a sequel rather than a good film with a decent story line developing characters. Now we're in 2015 and we have a brand new original Pixar movie called 'Inside Out' from the director of 'Up', Pete Docter. In fact, Pete Docter adapted the story from his own life where his parents packed him and his siblings up and moved across the country to a new place, where he had to make new friends and learn new surroundings.<br/><br/>It was rather tough for him, being young in a new school, having to deal with bullies and being ""the new kid"". This translates into a young girl named Riley who has two loving parents (voiced by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) who moves their family from Minnesota to San Francisco for a job. Riley is a great kid, who is popular, always nice, loves her parents, and is quick to make you laugh and care about what you have to say. This is mostly due to the emotions that live within her. According to Pixar, every living thing, whether it be a human, dog, or cat, have little beings living in our brain that make us function and feel the range of emotions we go thru life with.<br/><br/>Luckily for Riley, her main emotion is Joy (Amy Poehler) who is more or less in control of Riley most of the time, as she believes Riley should be happy every second of every day no matter what. There is also Sadness (Phyllis Smith from 'The Office'), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), who all make up the range of emotions that Riley shows thru her young life now. These emotions living in her head operate the control board in her brain to make her function, creating good and bad memories for her.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, something happens between Sadness and Joy, and they are thrown out of the ""brain control"" room, leaving Fear, Anger, and Disgust to operate Riley. As Joy and Sadness try to make their way back to the control room, they learn important life lessons in order to make a great living being. One of the things I love most about 'Inside Out' is that it never dumbs down any plot line for a younger audience, which was something 'Wall-E', 'Up', and 'Toy Story III' never did either.<br/><br/>Each character has its moment to shine and never sways off course or goes into the land of silliness to attract a cheap laugh. Instead, these wonderful characters take us on an emotional journey of new change and how to deal with our feelings. 'Inside Out' is a true delight to watch and I can't wait to watch it again. The voice actors are all excellent with Poehler and Smith delivering some excellent performances here. Lewis Black and Bill Hader are down right hilarious the whole way through as Anger and Fear. It's safe to say that Pixar is back on top again with 'Inside Out'.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br/><br/>P.S. - The short Pixar film before 'Inside Out' is called 'Lava' is FANTASTIC."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","4","25","23 July 2015"," Meaningful But Underexplored, it Feels Like Pixar Left a Few Things Unsaid Here
","Kudos to Pixar for this one, because they really took a swing with an ambitious, risky, leftfield concept that I honestly didn't think could work when I first laid eyes on the teaser trailer. It does work, and it's often quite clever in touching a broad range of delicate subjects in a way that can be appreciated by audiences young and old alike; no small balancing act. It's uproarious and cute and heady, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that we were just barely scratching the surface here, even as things began wrapping up. There's plenty brewing under the table, but it still feels superficial, and the big developments in the third act don't totally feel like they've been earned when the credits begin to roll. Granted, it's got a bushel of heavy messages to share, much more than many of its peers in the CG animation field, but when it's a delivery from the studio that brought us Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and Wall-E, there's a certain unspoken standard to meet. Inside Out represents a rebound for Pixar, certainly the best (and most creative) of their recent efforts, but it's not as sweeping, engulfing, or rewarding as the classic pedestals of their back catalog."
"aharmas","8","4","25","20 June 2015"," A Beautiful Animated Movie That Will Baffle Children
","Pixar is very good at creating universes, and some of its entries are wonders to behold. I can't imagine animation without ""The Incredibles"" exhilarating characters and adventures, the bittersweet characters in ""Up"", and ""Finding Nemo"" is pure magic. Here is ""Inside-Out"" a very grown up movie that looks very cute and is certainly appeal to children, only to end up frustrating many in that audience as the mysteries of the mind are painstakingly portrayed in colorful detail. It's a film to admire but one that demands a lot from the audience regarding what age one might be. One thing is for sure, kids under the ages of six are bound to ask plenty of questions if they're mature enough. Otherwise, prepare to have chaos in the auditorium, as I experienced during my show.<br/><br/>Tbe film is extremely analytical, very adult in its content and delivery. There is a very lengthy introduction, explaining to us what we are dealing with. Oh, yes, the emotions are shown as these very cute ""beings"" that live inside our heads, controlling our thoughts, actions, and emotions. They also have a very interesting way of classifying our memories and experiences, and the film tries really hard to drive the point through.<br/><br/>If one somehow manages to shut our audio receptors, to appreciate the wondrous animation, we have plenty to dazzle us visually, and unlike ""Toy Story"" where tears were earned naturally, making us almost feel like we were watching real life performances, we saw the power of great story telling. In here, the film struggles between being an complex depiction of how our emotions originate and their effects on our lives, and we deal with so many symbols, it is difficult to really appreciate each of them. Oh yes, that childhood toy is a fantastic piece of animation, and I love its voice, but I can't put aside the film, which never stops feeling like an essay instead of a story, of a film, of a piece of movie magic that can both entertain and be intelligent. This one demands to be appreciated.<br/><br/>One big problem with the film is that the cutesy aspect of the film grows tired pretty quickly, as we are very little to balance all the crisis everyone seems to be going through. I felt like everyone of the characters was eventually going to end up on the psychologist couch by the end of the film. I don't think I saw or heard anyone laughing at anything in the film. Oh yes, there was vocal acknowledgment of an event, but it was always an emotional burden.<br/><br/>I would be very interested to see how this film plays through its theatrical run, and how it is appreciated in its later stages in home entertainment. Will it earn the love of the other Pixar films or be deemed just a cute animation experiment? It remains to be seen. There will be nominations at the end of the year, most likely in the writing and technical categories. We can already see how the great vocal talent will be dismissed again, and there might not be enough emotional buy in to go all the way to a Best Picture candidate. There is no Beast here, and the family angle here is almost secondary to the antics of the animation and the complexity of the subject matter."
"AStormOfSwords13","10","4","25","19 June 2015"," Phenomenal
","Back in 2010, the last Pixar movie I had seen was Toy Story 3. It was phenomenal. Since then, I never got around to seeing Cars 2, Brave, or Monsters University. A bit more often, though still not very, I might see eye to eye with the critics. That might be because I never care what they have to say if I really want to enjoy a movie. Since Toy Story 3, no Pixar movie has ever caught my eye quite like Inside Out, so I decided to do an out- of-town viewing on the way home from work. I had nigh on 4 hours to kill anyway, and this already seemed like something to be very hopeful for. Thankfully, my hopes were well-placed because Pixar has pulled out a Hail Mary and scored a game- winning touchdown with Inside Out.<br/><br/>Inside Out deals with Riley's emotions, who must learn to grow when Riley moves to a new home. This proves easier said than done, but at the same time, it gives a chance to really build the world going on in Riley's mind. You have Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger as the emotions, and each one serves a purpose vital to how their person lives. But how they are vital isn't always apparent, and in the inside world, that's where the plot begins. My personal favorite character is the main one, Joy, who does the beginning and ending narrations.<br/><br/>It's a really cute film, something one of the people at my work told me. Because of this, it'll be an awesome choice for the whole family. In fact, I really think this breaks a Pixar world record for how cute it is because I can't find a Pixar film that has really been as cute as this. Other have their moments, but none quite like this. Maybe that's just Joy in my mind glowing out a yellow memory orb.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, everyone has these emotions, which brings me to my next point. It is really funny when it takes a light- hearted tone, but at the same time, it is relatable. I found myself relating to many of the characters in the film, from Riley to Sadness to Joy to even Anger and the minor characters. Moving can be tough on the children. I know this because I've moved around a lot in my elementary school years until I finally had a stable place for the rest of my childhood and it can really impact lives in the immediate and long run. This makes it sad to let some characters go, and there were such in this movie. It was well-done, but still really sad and has a shock value.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to hand it to Pixar: they can really please a crowd. I know this because my crowd, which was practically sold out, applauded at the end of this film. Inside Out is simply amazing and a must- see. Trust the critics and all the positive reviews on this one. You'll be glad you did."
"aqs_quincy","10","4","25","19 June 2015"," Best animated ORIGINAL movie of the past decade
","Growing up watching Pixar movies, I got used to excellence. Starting with Toy Story, Bugs Life, Monsters Inc... the franchise (if that's what you would call it) seemed to be impervious to failure. I remember, even as a kid, thinking that I could always rely on Pixar to make a good film. But their perfection in film ran dry with Cars 2, and continued the following two years with sub-par flicks Brave and Monsters University.<br/><br/>After taking a much needed year off, audiences were treated to Inside Out, a story of 5 emotions, given the task of monitoring and directing a young girl named Riley through the loneliness of leaving her hometown in Minnesota to live in San Francisco. After a brief mishap between the prime emotion of Joy, and the often-looked-over Sadness, the two are whisked away from Riley's ""Head-Quarters"" and off to her long-term memory, where they have to find a way to get back in order to save Riley from her own emotions.<br/><br/>Let me first say that I was initially skeptical. For one thing the idea of the story seemed far fetched and strange. Another, and for me more important factor, was the fact that this film is rated PG. I have always been a fan of the way Pixar has been able to make EXTREMELY family friendly movies and still make them relateable for kids and adults. I was afraid that this movie would resort to making potty humor jokes and slight innuendos that go way over kids heads (nod to the Shrek films). This isn't the case though. I don't think the humor is the reason this movie got a higher rating, but rather the very extreme emotional roller coaster this movie turned out to be.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of kids movies having an underlying moral purpose. This movie doesn't do that. It goes so much further as to put the moral purpose in front of the actual story. It's no question in anyone's mind that the actual point of this story was not for Joy to make it back to Head Quarters, but for Joy to realize that Sadness (or sadness) has a purpose in a person's life, and that it shouldn't be bottled. So many kids movies today teach things like ""being brave"", or ""loving family"". While those are very important, this movie may actually teach adults something... That sadness, while coming from a place of pain, is a means to a greater end, and ultimately joy.<br/><br/>This is why I would call this the Best original animated movie of the past ten years!"

"writerever365","10","4","25","19 June 2015"," Perhaps The Most Important Film Of The Year
","I walked into this film today with high expectations. They were met, and THEN SOME.<br/><br/>This film is the best film Pixar has ever churned out, bar none. It is quite easily the best film I've seen all year. The reason I say it's the most important film of the year is because of what it accomplishes for animation and for children's films in general.<br/><br/>So often, especially in children's cinema, we are told that everything ends up happy, and if you keep your chin up and don't let the ""mean reds"" (or the mean blues, as it were) get to you, you'll be fine. That old ""sun-will-come-out-tomorrow"", ""chin-up"", ""whistle- while-you- work"" attitude. But what this movie does is let everyone know the inescapable truth- it's OK - nay, healthy - to be sad for a time. It is only through sadness that we can feel the happiest, and this movie plays each card it can to make us feel that - and to great effect.<br/><br/>That aside, this movie is the best children's film I've seen in a LONG while, and especially from Pixar. Not since FINDING NEMO have I seen such a level of depth and emotion from a children's film. The animation is literally effervescent, with the emotions radiating a certain soda-bubbles effect that looks simply amazing.<br/><br/>As for the voice cast, they're flawless. Amy Poehler plays a unique level of emotion into Joy. Not only is she amazingly happy, but she knows just when to dial it back and be somber, and even tearful. Sadness steals the emotion show, however. Phyllis Smith is absolutely flawless in every way. Her portrayal of the timid emotion Sadness is as well-realized as any Oscar contender. Bill Hader and Lewis Black cracked me up as Fear and Anger respectively. Mindy Kaling was also very cute, even though her part in the film is notably small. Another voice credit shout out goes to Richard Kind, who plays an amazingly touching lost imaginary friend named Bing Bong. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, go see this film. Easily the most important children's film of the year, and also perhaps the most important film of the year.<br/><br/>10/10 - would recommend."

","A baby is born, she starts with Joy, is quickly joined by Sadness, and then as she grows up is joined by a whole range of other emotions, such as Fear, Anger, and Disgust, who work in the control center of a mind. <br/><br/>Inside Out's main conceit is that all behavior and actions are a series of events that occur within the mind that, no matter how small they may seem in the real world, are all vitally important. In this case, the action centers on an 11 year old girl named Riley whose family has moved from Minnesota to San Francisco. Moving at a young age is a traumatic experience, and in Inside Out, the move to a strange new city that serves broccoli on Pizza and doesn't get snow in the winter is the basis for a crisis that takes the girl away from her natural state of Joy. In fact, Joy is literally lost within the mind as Riley goes through this crisis, encountering issues which shatter the ""personality Islands"" of Riley's inner self, which are represented like sections of an amusement park, which go down after certain events occur within the real world.<br/><br/>It's an amusing take on the mind, and it is a lot to take in for an animated feature, but it is worth the time spent watching. It is all done in a way that is funny and touching, with some genuinely sad but not traumatic moments. There is loss here, but not the kind that will leave you crying for hours, if you are one of those that cry easily at movies. Very enjoyable film."
"Stompgal_87","8","4","26","16 January 2016"," Not my favourite Pixar film but colourful and thought-provoking nonetheless
","When I first saw this film at the cinema, I found it a little underwhelming due to having already seen certain clips of it on YouTube although the scene where Joy is in the memory dump brought tears to my eyes. The second time I saw it upon purchasing the DVD I enjoyed it even more.<br/><br/>The animation is bright, colourful and up to Pixar's usual standards and it is interesting to see how it changes when Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong take a so-called shortcut while the inside of Riley's head is realistically designed. The characters that represent Riley's emotions give more depth to her feelings and this concept is reminiscent of a Beano comic strip called The Numskulls. Joy is playful and optimistic for the most part although it is heartbreaking to see her cry in the memory dump; Sadness is suitably glum and the revelation of her true purpose is a pleasant surprise; Fear, Disgust and Anger all personify the rest of Riley's emotions perfectly and Bing Bong mostly has a similar personality to Joy but he is also fairly naive as well as supportive to her and Sadness. Riley is a headstrong, determined human lead character that all pre-teenagers can relate to and I like how her feelings conflict with her adapting to San Francisco as well as her relationship with her parents. The story is unique for a Pixar film and like the Toy Story franchise it has its fair share of uplifting and poignant moments and the scenes shown during the closing credits of other characters' emotions are hilarious. While most of the music is not particularly memorable there are some effective pieces such as when a very young Riley expresses her anger in response to her dad saying she won't get any dessert if she doesn't eat her broccoli and when Joy shows the rest of the emotion characters how Riley's memories are made and I like the Bing Bong song. While I'm not familiar with the majority of the voice cast they all did a great job with the voice acting particularly Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger and Mindy Kahling (also Taffyta Muttonfudge in Wreck-It Ralph) as Disgust. Bill Hader as fear wasn't quite as up to scratch as the rest of the emotions but he was decent nonetheless. Also this is the first time Poehler and Hader have provided voices in an animated film together since Hoodwinked Too, which I haven't seen in its entirety yet.<br/><br/>Overall not on par with other Pixar films such as the Toy Story franchise, A Bug's Life, Brave, Up and WALL-E but it is on par with Ratatouille and The Incredibles and better than Cars what with its colourful animation, thought-provoking story and relateable characters as its best aspects. 8/10."

","This movie was unbelievably good. Everyone expects animated movies to be just for 8 year olds and to be full of slapstick. At least, I did. And I've never been more wrong.<br/><br/>Inside Out follows 11 year old Riley and her five emotions - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. As Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, she is going through a lot and we get a look inside her head as Joy tries to keep her happy, and all the other emotions try to do their jobs. But things don't go very smoothly.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how this movie actually gives a valuable lesson. Throughout the movie, one thought that might be going through our heads is, ""What is the purpose of Sadness?"" As Joy explains in the beginning of the movie, everything seems to have a purpose except for Sadness. Its at the end that you finally realize what that purpose is. And that's when your tears flow.<br/><br/>I cried myself to sleep the night I saw this movie.<br/><br/>No, it doesn't have a sad ending. It's as happy as any animated movie. But it's so heart-touching. Pixar has really outdone itself with Inside Out. I am very impressed. It's so much better than all the other over-rated trash out there (like Minions). Why can't they make more movies like this? This one is a must watch for children, teens and adults like. When you finish watching this, trust me, the tears are worth it.

","Inside Out is the 15th feature film released by Pixar Animation Studios and continues the tradition of creating animated features that cater to multiple age groups by combining a vibrant, colorful and entertaining narrative that captivates kids while having a complex central theme that engages the adults. The film features young Riley from Minnesota who has five manifestations of her emotions in her mind - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The emotions influence her and control her day to day decisions and memories . When Riley turns 11, the family moves to San Francisco which puts her in emotional turmoil as she is a shy kid and finds it difficult to cope with a new environment. The resulting scenario leads her and her emotions to learn the importance of Sadness in life. <br/><br/>The film received rave reviews on the back of stellar performances by the voice cast led by Amy Poehler as Joy and Phyllis Smith as Sadness. Phyllis shines with her convincing rendition of the meek Sadness. Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader as the remaining emotions also give strong performances. Director Pete Docter excels at paying attention to detail. For example Riley's controlling emotion is shown to be Joy whereas her father is controlled by Anger and her mother by Sadness. Docter also succeeds in his attempt to create a model of the mind which is flexible enough to serve the purpose of the story yet is well thought out and consistent enough to stand on its own. This was achieved through consultation with Paul Ekman, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. <br/><br/>While the basic concept is strong, the story suffers from periods of inactivity and monotony. The film seems stretched and could have done without a few of the scenes that were left in by the director. The movie also has a disconnect with the younger section of the audience because unlike other Pixar movies, the light-hearted and downright funny moments are few and far between. The core element of the story is complex for kids watching and hence might not enjoy the movie as much as the adults that accompanying them. <br/><br/>The movie is a visual treat that leaves the audience with a smile on their face and a sense of fulfillment although with a little heavy handed editing the movie would have been even better."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","4","26","20 August 2015"," The Newest Pixar Triumph
","Yeah, okay, it's good; but is Pixar's newest film really that good? Truth is, the worst thing you can say about the worst Pixar films (cough, cough Cars 2) is by comparison they just don't reach the high bar set by Pixar itself. None of them are truly bad artistically. In fact, in comparison to other animation studios, Pixar remains a downright godsend. In that regard, Inside Out is a massive triumph.<br/><br/>Riley (Diaz) is just like any twelve-year-old Minnesotan girl. She loves her family and friends and likes to play hockey and goof off when she's not getting good grades in school. Up until now most of her memories are happy largely thanks to the emotions that run her mind. But when her family move to San Francisco those same emotions; Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Anger (Black), Fear (Hader) and Disgust (Kaling) must experience a parallel odyssey in the mind of young Riley.<br/><br/>On the whole the idea, while terrifically refreshing, thinly veils its 94 minute run time. This is including a subplot involving Joy and Sadness getting lost in Riley's subconscious and their odyssey to get back to mission control. While good for a full movie, it's much better as an animated short where straining for material doesn't feel too cloying. No matter, for the geniuses at Pixar know how to make things work story-wise using a myriad of psychological inside jokes and kid friendly humor. Having the ""dream factory"" look like a Hollywood studio was a particularly nice touch.<br/><br/>Pixar is also deft at making sympathetic characters and the emotions that work Riley's brain and influence her actions are well fleshed out. Its true that each character is meant to encapsulate the emotion they represent but their far from the flat characters I expected. It was honestly one of the most pleasant surprises I've seen in an animated film in some time. Joy probably goes through the largest character change realizing that despite her dour demeanor there is a place for Sadness in Riley's world. It helps that the voice actors chosen are able to convey so much so well.<br/><br/>Hang on though, Pixar isn't off the hook when it comes to all characters however. Perhaps it's just the limitations of the high- concept but with all these emotions controlling Riley's head, Riley herself comes off as one-dimensional. The decisions she makes are, well for lack of a better word emotional, and rely on little logic. I'm not saying a twelve-year-old should have an adult's understanding of consequence and forethought but for the most part she was simply reacting to stimuli like a behaviorist's wet-dream. There's little history or experience in her actions other than a hatred for broccoli. Likewise her parents are just flat. The father inhabits the role of the absent father whose busy with work...no new ground broken there, and the mother is just your run of the mill concerned mother too tacit to really see what's going on.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie's faults are outweighed by its successes. Its a gorgeous movie that does a great job creating the world inside the head of a twelve-year-old girl. It's said that the animators wanted the emotions to appear like apparitions and not as solid objects. In congress with the playful ergonomics of mission control and the creatures the populate the subconscious, Inside Out is yet another visual threshold the animators of Pixar have powered through.<br/><br/>Years ago when Up (2009) came out, I saw a news clip about Disney's irritation with Pixar's toy strategy. They were miffed because no child would ever buy a Carl Fredricksen action-figure complete with a tennis ball adorned cane. I'm sure a few rebels in Pixar giggled but John Lasseter and the executive board likely owed Disney's merchandisers for having a 70+ year-old protagonist. Inside Out offers cute characters who are sure to sell at Toys R Us as will The Good Dinosaur (2015), Finding Dory (2016), Toy Story 4 (2017), Incredibles 2 (TBA) and Cars 3 (TBA). Here's to hoping the future intent of Pixar movies remains telling a good yarn and not selling it."

","Pixar, the studio which brought us some of the overly cute and striking films of recent times like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, Shrek - to name a few, is back with another cinematic delight - Inside Out. The studio lives up to its reputation of presenting brilliantly scripted stories via amazing animations by delivering a film which rattles the existing notions of emotions and feelings.<br/><br/>The main characters of the movie are its five personified emotions- Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)- each capturing the essence of their respective name. The story revolves around a teenage girl, Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) and it depicts how her emotions make all the decisions of her life and help her cope with her problems.<br/><br/>As the plot develops, we witness complex interactions among these emotions and other elements of the mind, like dreams, thoughts and memories. Various events taking place in Riley's life are explored with respect to their connection with her emotions. The movie is an emotional roller-coaster, with some really poignant scenes interspersed with light-hearted moments.<br/><br/>As is expected from a Pixar movie, Inside Out pushes the boundaries of computer generated imagery and animation to give us an unforgettable experience. The soundtrack binds the story together wonderfully. In my opinion, the movie is an absolute treat for the senses and I recommend it as a must watch."

","I really enjoyed watching this Pixar Film. This is definitely one of my favorites. It exceeded my expectations. I was actually expecting to see ""the usual"" pixie movies, with typical and overrated plots. However, what I liked about this is that the screenplay has matured. I must say this film is not just for kids. I wonder why there are many critics hating on it. It's not bad as it seems. However I'm not much of a fan on how they executed the animation of the characters. The look and feel didn't seem to be the standard of Pixar's. It felt like a little cheap? I guess. This is not your typical ""funny & cute"" Pixar film. That's why probably many have over reacted that they won't encourage their kids to watch it. I would agree but I think this would also help Children's capability to understand different kinds of emotion and that is not a bad thing. Will definitely watch this again!"
"wcarlson-78415","Null","4","26","17 August 2015"," A hilarious and thought provoking film for the whole family
","You may have a slightly altered view of your own emotions or your family and friends after seeing 'Inside Out', Pixar's latest film. It's about a little girl, Riley, the only child of adoring parents. Her happy demeanour and idyllic life in rural America are threatened by a stressful move to San Francisco for her father's work. Most of the action takes place inside Riley's head where a Star Trek like bridge provides a command centre for Riley's emotions represented by 5 different cartoon characters: Joy, who is usually in charge; Fear; Sadness; Disgust and Anger. Other areas of the brain such as the subconscious and memory are also inventively represented. The film brilliantly and hilariously demonstrates how the conflict raging inside Riley's head between these emotions manifests itself on the outside. The 5 characters each take turns as the storyline progresses to steer Riley through the move, starting a new school and the other challenges she faces and we see how hard it is for them to avoid behaving true to type even though they all clearly want the best for her and things are reaching crisis point. The story will resonate with anyone who has ever relocated against their will but could leave anyone with thoughts and ideas that may help to make sense of everyday life. Next time I am feeling down I will recall what a genuine 'drag' Sadness was for Joy as the latter was forced to haul her through the labyrinth of Riley's long term memory corridors because she was 'too sad to move'. Fear is a neurotically thin figure whose attitude in the film will serve to remind what a waste of mental energy that emotion can be. We all know real life versions of these two and may try to limit our exposure to them but watch how the film deftly reminds you how useful sadness and fear can each be on occasion too â€“ just like the drippy neighbour who is great at fixing things or the dowdy colleague who is a good listener. You will similarly see the usefulness in the right place of Anger and Disgust. I viewed this film with 3 generations of my family and we all enjoyed it enormously. Many PG and U certificate films can entertain for a couple of hours but it's a rare one that has the potential to inform and delight a happy family or re-unite a troubled one."

"Lejink","5","1","3","13 April 2020"," It Never Entered My Mind
","I don't know but sometimes I felt as if I needed a degree in psychology to fully join up the thought processes which not only went together to create this acclaimed Disney / Pixar movie but also that went on inside the mind of the animated young girl Riley at the centre of the action.<br/><br/>Ambitious it certainly was, attempting the fine balance which all Pixar films strive to achieve between providing the cartoon fun beloved of young children and the sophistication demanded of the adult who more than likely has to accompany their child to the movie. I don't know if the five key emotions identified and depicted here of joy, sadness, disgust, fear and anger would be the ones I'd identify as primary to a pre-teen child, and once joy and sadness exited their main functions, struggled a little to explain some of the motivations choices made by the three remaining, competing feelings.<br/><br/>Again maybe it's me but I also didn't quite follow either the journey of the two dominant emotions back to the central cortex as it were and wondered a little if some of the characters they met along the way weren't just inserted for promotional tie-in purposes. I'd also argue that every child experiences a different mind-set as they grow up and didn't accept the applied generalised psychoanalysis here.<br/><br/>Okay, maybe all this means that cynicism would be one of the guiding traits in my own mind but even in the wider picture the film didn't really reach out to me in the usual Pixar manner in terms of humour or emotion. There were occasional humorous but not hilarious moments and certainly some lovely and lively animation to see but for me it all went a little above my head leaving my mind-set at the end in neutral."

","This is an amazing film. It sets the bar on how an animated film should be made. What makes this so great is that it's very mature. It's emotionally complex, in a way that will have kids and adults going back to this film and wondering about what it's going for. Unlike some kids films these days, it never talks down to its audience. The characters are all very deep and interesting, and of course, the animation is fantastic. But I find it innovative how they used the bright colors inside Riley's mind but used darker and more dreary colors in the real world. <br/><br/>Parents, in terms of how appropriate it is for your kid, keep in mind that this is emotional throughout and has very powerful scenes that will seem abnormal to your kid.

","I had recently made a review of Inside Out that was a little wishy washy and I was thinking it was mainly because the theatre experience I had, it put me in a close minded mood and I had to watch the movie in a way which was less than desirable. I decided to watch Inside Out again. Oh my goodness, Inside Out is a an artistic explosion, and a true piece of art. Pixar went full out on this one and really did an amazing job creating one of the best animated films of the decade. Great voice work by the entire cast, especially Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith, they were cast perfectly! They add SO much to the movie. The story takes dark turns, here and there and truly nostalgic turns too. Inside Out is scored flawlessly by Michael Giacchino as he creates a nostalgic and heartbreaking score. Inside Out has very similar vibes to Up, frankly because the emotion (punt totally intended) put into it is similar, and it is the same man who directed Up; Pete Docter. It doesn't open as powerfully as Up, but it doesn't mean the opening was bad, it was beautiful. Just expect one fabulous time in the movies, that's all I can say to prepare yourself. Go check Inside Out As soon as possible!"
"griffolyon12","10","4","27","19 June 2015"," One of Pixar's Best!
","It's funny how people still seem surprised when Pixar does something the likes of which have never been seen before. They do a couple of sequels/prequels, take a year off, and everyone talks as if they are running out of ideas, but their new film, Inside Out, is the perfect example of why that was just foolish talk.<br/><br/>Inside Out is perhaps the most inventive movie I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot. The whole concept of the movie is what happens inside your head, personifying your five core emotions of Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger, as cartoon characters. Where ordinarily the human character would be the star of the movie, here, 12-year-old Riley, is the setting of the film. While we do experience Riley's difficult move to San Francisco with her parents, almost everything is seen through the lens of the emotions operating the control center in Riley's head. Pixar could have stopped there and this film would be different than any other, but they then start to delve into areas such as the subconscious or abstract thought (all to funny but psychologically factual results I might add), and turn the film into the smallest, most intimate epic that has ever existed in movie history.<br/><br/>It would be very easy for me to give away the whole movie here, because there are so many good moments in Inside Out, but I will refrain from doing so because this is as emotionally rich a movie as Pixar has ever made, and a movie about emotion deserves to have its emotional experience preserved. What I will say is that only the filmmakers at Pixar could take an idea like this and make it so easy to relate to, and yet also so complex if you're willing to read between the lines. The fact that they make each emotion an individual three-dimensional character and not just a caricature of what their core emotion is, is one of the most impressive things this movie does, and it really ties into the theme of the movie. No person is all one emotion all the time, you often need a balance of your emotions to properly navigate life, and that is what Joy in particular has to learn before the end of her journey in Inside Out. In truth, this movie kind of has everything I want out of a movie, and while every Pixar movie is always good, this one has one of Pixar's greatest secret weapons at the helm, director Pete Docter.<br/><br/>Pete Docter is one of the few directors in the world of movies that I can honestly say has never made anything less than a perfect film. He directed Monsters, Inc., Up, and now has directed Inside Out. Any one man that can direct those three movies deserves Oscar recognition of the directing variety. It really is quite funny when you watch all of the Pixar movies, if you pay attention, you can kind of see the directorial hands at work. I know they always talk about their team based approach, but there is always a leader of that team. If you watch a John Lasseter movie it's usually more child-like than other Pixar films. You watch an Andrew Stanton movie it's usually full of big, cerebral ideas on top of its emotional narrative. You watch a Brad Bird movie and it's usually the funniest of the bunch. When you watch a Pete Docter movie, you usually are punched in the gut by the raw emotion on display. That is what sets Docter and his movies apart from other Pixar movies, that ability to really get at the core emotional ideas of the narrative. I guess you can say it's because to Docter, movies are personal. I know he said that this movie was inspired by his own daughter and the changes her personality started going through as she was leaving childhood behind, causing him to wonder what was going on inside of her head. In short, it's for reasons like that, that we need more directors like Docter in both animation and live action.<br/><br/>So what more can I say about Inside Out to make you go see it? It's beautifully animated, the voice talent all do excellent work, composer Michael Giacchino has written an almost Mario-infused score that is beautiful and ethereal, and the movie is just funny and emotional (pardon the pun) all in one brief 90-minute timeframe. Inside Out is worthy of being considered one of Pixar's best, and that is saying something."

The idea with the ""islands"" was totally undeveloped or not well thought out, for example she must only have had one friend at the beginning, which can't have been the case, otherwise the island wouldn't have collapsed. It started to annoy me when I realised that a better name for ""Joy"" would have been ""Passive- aggressive"". It could have been really good had the characters, in particular the emotions, been better contrived. It also shocked me that the ""sadness"" emotion was fat, frumpy, shy with glasses, and that ""Joy' was slim, no glasses etc. Was there really any need for this?

They have seldom faltered in that area, and when they are on song, you get absolute masterpieces like Up, Toy Story 3 or Finding Nemo, which make you feel ""Oh my god, it's so good"" while you're watching, and then you leave the theatre (or your screen) with a slightly heavy heart and a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Inside Out is on a way another level.<br/><br/>Absolutely brilliant."

","This new Disney/Pixar film, from the creators of Toy Story and Up, was being advertised a lot a few months before release, including in Sky Broadband and Subway adverts, the concept definitely looked appealing to me, and critics were giving it high praise, so I was really up for seeing it. Basically a girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is born in Minnesota, and her five key emotions were manifested one by one, Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black), the emotions live in Headquarters, Riley's conscious mind, where they influence Riley's actions and memories via a control console. Riley's new memories created are stored in coloured orbs, they are all sent to storage at the end of every waking period, the most important ""core"" memories are housed in a Headquarters hub and power five ""islands"" each reflecting Riley's personality: Hockey Island - created from Riley's love for the sport, Goofball Island - created from Riley's fun-loving side, Family Island - created from her love of her family, Honesty Island - created from her honest nature, and Friendship Island - created from her ability to have and make friends. Joy is Riley's dominant emotion, keeping Riley in a happy state, she and the other emotions do not understand the purpose of Sadness, it is when Riley has turned 11 that her family are relocating to San Francisco after her Dad (Kyle MacLachlan) gets a new job, and Sadness is somehow causing happy memories to turn sad, and Sadness causes Riley to cry on her first day at her new school, causing a new sad ""core"" memory. Joy tries to dispose of this new memory, but she accidentally knocks core memories loose in a struggle with Sadness, and the shutdown of personality islands causing them to become unstable, and together Joy, Sadness and the core memories end up being sucked out of Headquarters through the memory tube, leading to the rest of Riley's mind, they end up in the labyrinth-like storage area of Riley's long-term memories. While Joy carrying the Core memories and Sadness are trying to get back to Headquarters, the three remaining emotions Anger, Disgust and Fear are attempting to maintain Riley's emotional state, but they inadvertently cause her to become distant from her Dad and Mom (Diane Lane), her friends and her hobbies, consequently her personality islands are crumbling and falling into the Memory Dump, an abyss where faded memories are disposed and forgotten. Anger decides to insert an idea for Riley to run away back to Minnesota, believing happy memories can be produced there, meanwhile Joy and Sadness have run into Riley's childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), who wishes to reconnect with her, he guides them back to Headquarters, telling them they can get there riding the Train of Thought, they explore different areas of Riley's mind along the way, including Dreamland and Imagination Land. They do eventually catch the train, but it becomes derailed with the collapse of another personality island, as Riley prepares to board a bus to Minnesota, Joy attempts to use a recall tube back to Headquarters, but the last personality island falls and breaks the tube, sending Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump, she despairs and looks at memories, she finds a sad memory that became happy, when Riley lost a hockey game and was consoled by her parents, she realises Sadness's importance. Joy and Bing Bong find his discarded song- powered wagon to escape, but many failed attempts Bing Bong realises his weight is too much, so he jumps out on their final attempt and fades away in the abyss, Joy uses various tools from Imagination Land to propel herself and Sadness to Headquarters, there they find Anger's idea has disabled the control, making Riley depressed and almost unresponsive, returned Joy urges Sadness to take control, the idea is successfully removed, the console is reactivated and Riley is prompted to return home. Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley returns home and breaks down in tears, confessing to her parents she misses her old life, they reassure and comfort her, Joy and Sadness work together to create a combined core memory, it also creates a new personality island is created. A year later, Riley has adapted to her new life in San Francisco, all her emotions work together using an expanded control console and help her lead a happy and more emotionally complex life, with more new personality islands produced by new core memories combined by multiple emotions. Also starring Dave Goelz as Subconscious Guard Frank, Frank Oz as Subconscious Guard Dave, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Mind Worker Cop Jake and John Ratzenberger as Fritz. The voice cast are all chosen well, the characters all have good personalities and the colourful nature of this film will appeal to younger audience members, while the voices inside your head concept and complicated emotions working together element will keep the older audience interested, it perhaps becomes overcomplicated in small places, but memories, emotions and the human mind are complex subjects, it is clever, creative and fun family movie, an enjoyable animated adventure comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated.

","With the school holidays having arrived,a friend asked me if there were any good movies out that she and her kids could go and see.After having seen some very interesting ads for the film,it felt like the perfect time to view Pixar's latest title from the inside out.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Seconds after a girl called Riley is born,the emotion of Joy manifests itself in her head.As Joy gets Riley to smile for the first time in her life,another emotion slogs along called Sadness,who causes Riley to cry for the first time.As Riley grows up,5 emotions manifest within her head,with the emotions being Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger,who influence Riley's actions and memories with a control console.<br/><br/>Since Riley has lived a life filled with happiness over the years,Joy finds herself struggling over how to guide Riley,when her dad gets a new job,which leads to the family having to move to a new city and leaving all of Riley's friends behind. Optimistic over Riley getting a new dream house,Joy is disappointed to find that the new house is in ruins.As Joy tries to get Riley to focus on here happy ""core"" memories,Sadness causes Riley to create her first ever sad ""core memory."" Whilst trying to stop the new memory joining the core group,Joy ends up accidentally shutting down major parts of Riley's personality.Desperate to repair the damage,Sadness & Joy decide to go and explore the rest of Riley's mind.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>For the screenplay of the film,co-writers/(along with Meg LeFauve/Josh Cooley/Amy Poehler and Bill Hader take the extremely daring decision to avoid the simple cartoon good V evil route,by showing each of the 5 emotions as each being good,but flawed components to Riley's personality.Showing a remarkable precision in choosing to reveal what is taking place outside of Riley's head,the writers give Riley's family life a delicate touch,as the parents are shown to be truly loving towards their daughter,but also struggling with the new emotions that they are experiencing. <br/><br/>Largely taking place in Riley's mind,the writers keep the thought moving at a superb pace,thanks to giving each part of Riley's mind distinctive,quirky features,and also gradually displaying Riley's growing maturity by having the separate emotions find themselves working as a team.<br/><br/>Exploring every inch of Riley's mind,directors Pete Docter & Ronaldo Del Carmen build an extraordinary ,vibrant world,which goes from a Hollywood studio being Riley's ""dream factory"",to fading colours lighting up Riley's forgotten memories.Focusing on 5 major emotions in Riley's personality,the directors give each of them a lavish appearance,as Joy sparklesÂ…joy across the screen in wild yellow dashes,whilst Sadness brings everything down to earth in light blue shades.<br/><br/>Bringing the happiness in Riley to life, Amy Poehler gives a fantastic performance as Joy,thanks to Poehler stopping Joy from becoming sickly sweet,by giving Joy an increasing tenderness in her relationship Sadness.Joining Poehler, Lewis Black gives a hilariously explosive performance as Anger,whilst Richard Kind brings imaginary friend Bing Bong to life at a dazzling speed,and Phyllis Smith scatters very funny down beat one-liners across the movie in her performance wonderful performance as Sadness,in a film which explores the inside,and outside life of Riley."

","""Inside out"" is, in my humble opinion the best movie Pixar has ever made. As an animation studio, they have managed to set themselves apart with beautiful heartfelt stories that continue down the line of Walt Disney's masterpieces.<br/><br/>Here we see five predominant emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger, as characters inside a little girl's head. From her birth, we follow the emotions on how they make us do what we do. Get mad, laugh, cry, even how we dream. Every single aspect of our mind is depicted in colorful well thought of places and characters. From the ""subconcious prison"" to ""imagination land""; light bulbs to plug in for ideas, memories getting stored in shelves or even the train of thought that runs through our heads.<br/><br/>""Inside out"" has achieved everything. It is both an adventure and a coming of age story where the humans are not as close to us as the little people inside our head are, but they are still so real. The movie will make you feel both nostalgia and joy as you watch your emotions and memories pass by on the screen. It's about acceptance, and makes us see sense in how we evolve towards adulthood.<br/><br/>Here, your mind is a town full of complex mechanisms that somehow make sense if we picture it inside our heads. Pixar has made another masterpiece, but this time it isn't it's characters or its story you will remember, it's the universe and its morality, the great lesson you take into account about your emotions and yourself. You will laugh, cry and feel as if no other film or cartoon has ever showed who we are and how we work as humans better than ""Inside out"". One you have seen it, you will no doubt carry on with your daily life imagining your emotions running around inside your head."

"pongup","6","2","10","5 October 2017"," Failed miserably
","Disney's animation never runs short of the idea. This one is again giving us something fresh, a girl with 5 living emotions inside her head. Unfortunately, it lacks the most important thing of an animation --- fun. Without fun, nothing is worth seeing. This movie is not fun for the kids, not fun for teens, and not fun for adults. It tried too hard to teach life lessons but it failed miserably. The movie is boring, below Disney's standard, and nothing to talk about."
"lee_eisenberg","5","3","19","23 March 2017"," What would another emotion be?
","I should start by saying that I'm not any fan of Disney movies. Even so, ""Inside Out"" is an interesting look at the evolution of human emotions and the problems that people can have adjusting to a new location. I particularly liked the part where they showed dreams getting produced Hollywood-style. My personal favorite of the emotions was Anger, just because I liked the way that he was always about to explode. If there were another emotion in Riley's head, maybe it would be cynicism (is that considered an emotion?). I haven't seen any of 2015's other nominees for Best Animated Feature, so I can't compare this one, but it seems as though they only award Disney movies.<br/><br/>And of course I can't avoid talking about the cast. Amy Poehler and Bill Hader are former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members (co-star Bobby Moynihan still is). Lewis Black does skits in the persona of someone approaching a mental breakdown, so he's the perfect person to voice Anger. Mindy Kaling is best known as a comedian, but made a good point about the lack of attention paid to the recent murder of an Indian-American (by someone who said ""Get out of our country!""). This is the first that I've ever heard of Phyllis Smith or Richard Kind. Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan are pretty well known. Paula Poundstone had been around for years before I heard about her (and I heard about her due to her run-in with the law). Frank Oz is best known for his Muppets work but has also directed a number of movies, including one called ""In & Out"" (IMDb needs to include that in the trivia). Flea is a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. John Ratzenberger voiced the piggy bank in ""Toy Story"". Rashida Jones is Quincy Jones's daughter.<br/><br/>All in all, a pretty enjoyable movie."

Her mind is controlled by five emotions, happiness, fear, disgust, sadness and fury.

"joshvonhousen","6","3","19","14 March 2016"," Not TERRIBLE, But It Has Too Many Problems
","Now, I was extremely late when it came to watching this movie, and by then, it had already won the Oscar for Best Animated Picture (Note: A Studio Ghibli film lost to this!) and had read tons and tons of glowing reviews and heard everyone talk about how ""life- changing"" it is. So, naturally, my expectations were pretty high..... <br/><br/>Well, let's just get right into it. This movie just has way too many inconsistencies in it for me to, in good conscience, enjoy it. First, by the end of the movie, I was still kind of confused on how this world in Riley's head works. It just leaves so much unexplained. Why is it that the orbs only change color when Sadness touches them? How come this has never happened before? Why can't Joy turn them back? Of course, these small problems only add to the OTHER problems I have...<br/><br/>When they first move to San Francisco, Riley's mom asks how her day was, and the emotions scramble to find a positive memory form that day. So, they pull one right off of that days shelf and put it on the weird hover-projector thing. This causes Riley not only to remember it, but also feel happy. Until Sadness effs if up. But, later in the movie, when Riley is playing hockey with her new team, Fear gets a positive memory about playing hockey and tries to put it in the core memories. But, it doesn't work and they have no idea what to do. Why don't they just put it on the projector? Seems to work just fine in these kinds of situations...<br/><br/>How come everyone else's emotions resemble them, but Riley's emotions are completely random? Just bothers me...<br/><br/>Also, this film is kind of repetitive. They try to get to an island in her mind, but it goes down. That's pretty much it. It honestly just feels like the writers were just making it up as they go along. I mean, at one point, we see these workers sending memories for the long- term memory storage to Headquarters. Why don't our two mains go through that thing? We established that they ca FIT in those tubes that emotions go through. That's how they GOT THERE! <br/><br/>This film could've worked really well as a short film, but it just felt as though they were really trying to reach that 1hr and 1/2 mark. <br/><br/>People call this film ""original"". I don't see it. I mean, none of these characters really seem that original. The only resemblance of creativity in this movie is the scene where they try to wake up Riley in her dream state. The rest just felt like stalling and I just can't get behind it. <br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad movie, but there's just these small issues that add up to this mess. It's fine as a movie, but a HUGE let down as a Pixar movie and an Oscar winner."

","I really enjoyed this Movie. It tells the story of how Peoples feelings get triggered and impact each other, in such an original way. Its a great idea to let the feelings be represented by characters, who try their best to take the right actions - when sometimes failing to do just that. I cant remember the last time I laughed so much when seeing an animated Movie. I really got a lot of sympathy for the main characters, especially Riley and Joy. They are so full of life and emotions, so its hard not to get affected by them. The pink elephant Bing Bong also cracked me up with his dorky ways, and the way the Movie represents how memories are stored is satisfying. I think the Message about trying to really remember the good memories in life also is a lesson Worth Learning. How we focus emotionally on Our past, also helps us looking the right way at Our future. Thats not too easy always of course, but it is nevertheless true. Go see this great Movie! Im sure most of you wont regret it!"
"Buddy-51","7","3","21","15 April 2016"," Imaginative and insightful
","I may be going out on a limb here, but it's probably safe to say that ""Inside Out"" is the first mainstream animated feature film to be entirely centered around a seriously depressed child. <br/><br/>The reason Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is so depressed is that the personified emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) - that are responsible for keeping her psyche running smoothly have been seriously flubbing up of late. So much so that Riley runs the risk of experiencing a full mental breakdown if the emotional team can't retrieve all the core happy memories from Riley's childhood that are rapidly slipping away.<br/><br/>Imaginatively conceived by Pete Docter, Meg Lefauve, Josh Cooley and director Ronnie del Carmen, ""Inside Out"" takes place in two entirely distinct realms: first, in the ""real"" world, where a young girl has been dragged by her well-meaning but oblivious parents (Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Lane) from Minnesota to their new home in San Francisco; and, second, in the complex inner workings of said child's brain - a place filled with personality islands and memory balls all operated by the aforementioned Emotions from a giant console. <br/><br/>Rare for a movie aimed primarily at children, ""Inside Out"" is psychologically astute in its observations about human nature while remaining fanciful and childlike in tone and attitude. It explores the things that really matter to a youngster who's suddenly been yanked from a world where everything is comfortable and familiar to one where everything is unsettling and strange. The movie also points out how even the most well-intentioned of adults often fail to take into account children's very real feelings at crucial moments in their lives. <br/><br/>On a technical level, ""Inside Out"" comes replete with all the visually stunning graphics, fast-paced storytelling, and outstanding voice work that we've long associated with any computer-animated feature produced by Pixar Studios. But it's the less tangible elements of heart and imagination that truly count in this work."
"gbvisions","9","3","21","29 February 2016"," Inside Out either way, it's Full of Life & Creativity!!!
","Having going inside someone's mind & depicting it's working is merely a brilliant concept. This movie takes us on a ride inside a new born girl's mind and how her main emotions - joy, anger, disgust, fear, sadness tackles with each other as she grows. The movie shows us the real need of every emotion but in right amount at every step of our life. It is hard to find our real personality when even a single emotions is been neglected by us.<br/><br/>The screenplay, the animation, the characterization of each emotion is par excellence. The small creative ideas about how our mind works is depicted so wonderfully that one can related to its existence in our own mind. The film celebrates the life & the living.<br/><br/>And yeah, no matter is what situation you are in life, never loose your personality islands, not a single one!"
"Vartiainen","Null","3","21","18 November 2015"," Marvelously clever and insightful
","In many ways Pixar is the only animation studio that can stand on par with Disney when it comes to the quality of their movies. And this film just might be crowning achievement of that. It tells about a young eleven-year-old girl, Riley, whose family moves from rural Minnesota to San Francisco. This causes great upheaval in her tiny little head and we get to see it play out. And in more detail than you'd ever imagine. For you see, all those tiny little voices in your head? In this movie they're real people, populating the control center of your head, guiding your actions. This is a movie about them as much as it is about Riley.<br/><br/>And yes, the idea has been done before, but usually as a throwaway gag, as a punchline to a joke, or as a fodder for jokes. And yeah, this is a lighthearted family animation film, there are plenty of jokes here as well, but the idea itself is treated very seriously and very maturely. What does it really mean to be influences by your emotions? What emotions are responsible for which aspects of your life? For example, what emotion do you need to feel empathy towards others? Think about it for a minute. The answer might surprise you.<br/><br/>While exploring the possibilities we also get the usual Pixar goodies. Exciting adventure, fantastic voice acting, superb animation, good music and some real tearjerker moments. It's an emotional film - try not to die from shock - but in the best possible way. It earns those laughs, tears and shudders. It's that good and that confident in its story.<br/><br/>And yeah, I have some nitpicks, like the fact that it is a bit strange that there's only one positive emotion, Joy, against four negative ones, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust. Or the fact that most of the side characters have extremely lazy character designs. The set designs and overall art style are both fantastic, but the side characters are mostly just blobs of colour, for some baffling reason. But that's just nitpicking. Nothing in this film is outright flawed.<br/><br/>This just jumped straight into the position of my favourite Pixar film. It's mature, insightful, just as suitable for adults as it is for kids and it's exactly the kind of film you can see over and over throughout your life and it will keep growing with you. So good to have you back, Pixar."
"Irishchatter","8","3","21","3 August 2015"," A nice film to watch....
","I have to say this film gave me quite a lot of mixed emotions of the way the film was done out like I was laughing from the whole beginning of it. Then I was getting freaked out when the islands were going down and of course sadness came around when they couldn't get back to their headquarters & of course, Bingbong disappearing. Then of course when it was the ending, I became happy again. I'm like jaysus, I never realize that I'm full of emotions when the actual film was very much based on human emotions!<br/><br/>You know, Disney nowadays are pretty much keeping their movies so innocent in which I'm glad they are doing this regardless. <br/><br/>I will show this to kid but there are some scenes intense lemme tell you!"
"Blurviewer","8","3","21","15 July 2015"," Not bad as a kid movie
","As a cartoon movie for kids, I would say it is remarkable. The most outstanding thing in this movie is the perspective which is new and fresh. It illustrates two lines that are causal but also parallel at the same time and it is like telling a story in two views, which impresses the audience on its topic: Happiness. The meaning is not deep but the way the film tells it bears watching. <br/><br/>Again, excellent imagination in this cartoon movie, which gives a fantastic base to the story. People would feel special and be attracted.<br/><br/>However, as a young adult watching this movie, I am not highly recommending it because I find many jokes in it a bit childish and some harshness in some parts of the story."
"seccretservicce","9","3","21","24 June 2015"," Great for kids, better for adults
","As most of the animation movies, which has high ratings on IMDb, this movie did not make me feel disappointed. Fun for kids and definitely exciting for adults too, because it makes you THINK. Think about how fast we grow up and how much we love to complain about everything. Most kids have a dream of knowing how our brain looks from inside, how the dreams are made, why we forget many things and how the emotions control us. And there we have it - in this movie. <br/><br/>Animation movies don't need to be criticized much - they can be sometimes illogical, funny or weird, because it is how the kids brain works and lets be honest, we don't watch animation movies to feel horrified or sad. Colorful world, stereotyped characters, happy endings - you can find it all in ""Inside Out"". It will make you smile, value your life and maybe shed a tear or two at the end. <br/><br/>9 stars from me just because the animations sometimes were a bit too old fashioned for me."
"witness-7","6","3","22","6 February 2016"," Why did Pixar remake the TV show ""Herman's Head""?
","If you remember the early 90s TV show, Herman's Head, you probably know about how its impact on TV was more how its cast powered The Simpsons. And if you remember the premise at all, you'd remember how silly an idea it was.<br/><br/>Which makes it shocking that Pixar decided to essentially turn it into an animated movie about an 11-year-old girl disaffected by a family move.<br/><br/>Minor character spoilers ahead - but nothing you wouldn't see in a movie review. <br/><br/>The execution is generally Pixar quality. But there are some major story design flaws. Why is Joy the dominant emotion and the rest are just problems? They tried to make peace with it through Sadness later on, but it still came off as a forced attempt to validate the value of any of her other emotions. <br/><br/>The rest is very much an Alice in Wonderland/Wizard of Oz story, which is great for kids. Good humor. Some cute staging of scenes. But the 11-year-old played by Amy Poehlers voice is very one-dimensional in her transformation. <br/><br/>There are enough Pixar employees who capture San Francisco quite well, but this might have worked better as a kid moving to Minnesota."
"TxMike","Null","3","22","11 December 2015"," Nicely animated, we learn about the ""head office"" behind each of our emotions.
","Very nice animation, it tells the story of a young girl who has grown up in Minnesota but is uprooted when her dad and mom have to move to San Francisco with his job. Young Riley has many good memories, her friends, her hockey team. But she hits a rough patch after they move.<br/><br/>But the animated movie isn't so much about Riley and her folks as it is about the world of ""head office."" It is an unseen world where each person, and even pets, have a tiny entity for each of their emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, etc. <br/><br/>The story starts when Riley is first born, the team of unseen entities see through her eyes and give her emotions motivation. Her memories are represented by different color spheres stored in permanent memory in head office. <br/><br/>The two main emotions we see are voiced by Amy Poehler as Riley's Joy and Phyllis Smith as Riley's Sadness. And we see that sometimes sadness is necessary to appreciate what is really important.<br/><br/>I like it for the novelty, it makes one think."
"blaijonj","9","3","22","3 August 2015"," Wow...!
","I'd heard that Inside Out was 'good', but was surprised at how big a punch this little movie packs. Starting with the very few downsides; the narrative goes a little flat at least once during the movie, and the few characters there are, take slightly too long to warm up - but that's it...that's all I can draw from this film that is conceivably less than great. Everything else is just perfect. There's one pivotal scene (you'll know it when you get to it; about half-way in) when the emotional depth of the storyline really hits home. Everything had been building subtly to this point and all that ensues flows beautifully. For me, this is the point from which the movie makes perfect sense and holds your heartstrings tightly until the end. Congratulations to the screenwriters, artists, technical talent, director and entire production team - you've created a poignant, intricate and thoroughly satisfying story that visually pleases everyone (young children especially) and a narrative that will appeal to adults (parents especially). Thank-you."
"vitormoritzmoser","7","3","22","20 July 2015"," An interesting parody about human emotional equilibrium
","The point of this movie is so simple that maybe I tried to figure out what way it was going to take. And I felt surprise. The point is that the human being cannot live holding and choking one of its emotions. So, they presented us Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. They are emotions of the kid Riley, and they work in her brain to keep her balanced. Once Joy and Sadness were unbalanced during her childhood, Sadness did not find itself useful and naturally started a sequence of mess in her head. As an effect, she was thrown with Joy out of the ""control zone"" towards the mazes of memories and personalities islands. The moment that everything happened was one of the most scary moments of our childhood: the moment you enter in a new school.(Genial script!) So, this is not a movie about the kid Riley. Her personality had been constructed and destroyed and then reconstructed all during the piece and again, this is not a movie about her. Instead of that, this piece is about her emotions and how they are connected with each other in the construction of her personality. And how sometimes, Sadness needs to take control. Because if you are an human being, Sadness is there, somewhere, repressed or not."
"reviewsbycaleb","7","3","22","12 July 2015"," Surprising Dramatical heft with limited laughs
","Is a kid's movie that is incredibly moving and thought provoking still successful if its only mildly funny? Came into this one with pretty high expectations due to the eye-popping reviews and it was the first film I brought my niece and nephew too. If you have seen my top movies of 2014 lists, then it is apparent that I can really appreciate animated movies, with The Lego Movie being my #2 favorite movie of that year. Would Inside Out be this years Lego Movie? or the bigger question, would my niece Henley be able to sit through a whole movie? Inside Out is an inventive story that follows a young girl Riley and her emotions; Joy, Rage, Fear, Sadness, and Disgust. She is a seemingly happy girl with her family up in Minnesota and with Joy (Amy Poehler) at the controls of her emotions. There are bowling ball looking spheres that represent memories; gold for joy, green for disgust, red for anger, green for fear, and blue for sadness. With Joy leading the way of all the emotions, most of the spherical memories in Riley's mental inventory were a pure gold, including the core memories that helped create thematic islands that represent Riley's life. Then within a blink of an eye Riley gets uprooted from her life in Minnesota and moves to San Fransisco. All the emotions panic and Joy's joy is shaken for a split second for the first time before she gains composure and tries to put on a smile during a bad situation.<br/><br/>As you can tell so far the story and idea are incredibly clever, and the execution was nearly flawless, but the big missing piece for me was the humor. The laughs for me were sparse, which was even true for my 3 year old niece, and 5 year old nephew. Spoiler: Brecken enjoyed the movie while Henley couldn't sit still, and even if she was sitting still, all the worth while themes would of probably flown over her head, but we still had a great time.<br/><br/>Once in San Fransisco, the fight gets real for Joy and the rest of the emotions to make Riley happy. Joy loses control though of sadness, who keeps touching memories which makes these joyful memories into sad memories. In the middle of one of these scruffs of joy trying to keep memories from sadness, they both get sucked out of the emotion headquarters and into the long-term memories. With joy gone and unable to help Riley's emotions, the happy and loving girl fades into a disgusted and fearfully angry girl, mainly towards to her parents (like so many of us did when we were kids). Riley, on the inside and out, slowly falls apart into an emotionally numb pre teen. This is actually a pretty dynamic and long plot for a kids movie so with specifics to the plot that's where I'll leave you.<br/><br/>When Joy is out trying to get back to the headquarters and throughout, Inside Out becomes an allegory that hits pretty heavily on some weighty issues regarding emotionally numb teens due to adults expecting you to always be happy, or just over medication of our kids. This works remarkably well and the emotional heft of this animated movie is pretty remarkable because this is a tremendously heavy and important topic it is hitting. Anyone who's grown up, which is everyone, really can relate to Riley and the battle of feeling like you have to be happy all the time even when there are times for sadness and how those mix of emotions can be a beautiful thing.<br/><br/>While Inside Out may of been lacking in laughs, it is more than successful in provoking deep thoughts and pulling at the heart strings. Younger kids below 7 or 8 probably will like something like the minions more due to its more obvious humor but for those looking for surprising dramatic heft, Inside Out is for you. Disclaimer: Missed about 3 minutes in the middle taking Henley to the bathroom and dispensing popcorn and their drink throughout, so may of missed some of the more clever jokes."

","I saw this and Minions back to back today. Was impressed with the thought that went into the plot and the messages. Very touching movie as you relate the way the motions are played and you think how one relates with family and friends in your life and as you grew up. For me, I kept thinking about how I communicate with my 84 year old mom who is quite stubborn but in need of a lot of support. Quality production with excellent animation (was also impressed with Minions animation). So not every movie can be everything and this movie was typically high quality Pixar message. Minions was just a fun romp. I recommend both highly in their own realm of animated movies. While I did very much enjoy Penguins of Madagascar, especially the second time I saw it, and loved many of their shorts as being really creative fun, I would say that Minions was a bit more entertaining as a spin-off movie than Penguins. So, if you really liked Penguins, I would think you would at least enjoy Minions as much. For me, I just want to be entertained for 90 to 250 minutes and catch a movie or two Saturday mornings to wind down from the work week and don't mind soft-pedaled messages mixed in with a lot of fun."
"estreet-eva","7","3","22","7 July 2015"," Pretty good on the Pixar scale
","Featuring a clever conceit and the standard glorious Pixar animation, ""inside Out"" fails to fail like ""Cars 2"" or ""Brave"" but doesn't become an instant classic like ""Monsters University"" or ""Wall-E."" As usual the world-building -in this case the internal monolouge of an eleven- year old girl - yields an immersive and discuss-able experience. It falls somewhat short of, say, ""The Incredibles"" when it comes to snappy dialog or repeatable lines. The fact that line where the character Sadness is told to ""be positive"" and responds with ""I'm positive we're going to get lost"" actually makes the trailer gives you a sense of the weakness of the script. The voice-acting and cast choices are solid if not bold - see Lewis Black as ""Anger"". In short, well worth seeing although you could wait until it shows up on streaming video."

Disney are holding Pixar back, but Pixar still got their imaginations. Hopefully, they can produce a nice series after Inside Out 1"

","Some of the ideas in this movie smack of pop psychology which, though probably right, is stuff that you have to accumulate over years, but will kids get it? I doubt it. <br/><br/>So a lot of this is really meant for adults, and it's mostly entertaining and even a bit intellectually provocative, but it isn't a game changer or even anything that can't wait for DVD with the one exception of those moving to a new home with a kid having to change their school. For them it might be very useful for all involved to ponder the points made in this clever movie but for most people it'll just be mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>Despite all that the movie is getting rave reviews. I can only think people are unfamiliar with its ideas and appreciative of getting a new point of view. So if you've never heard of long term memory this might be the movie for you."

","One of the best things about the movie that I appreciated was the little things. The little bits of humor that if you stop and think about it too long you will miss the next bit. The whole joke that rings true about the gum jingle that gets stuck in your head and only comes to you in a weird times.<br/><br/>And then the movie is smart. The whole process behind the intellect, the memories, long-term and short-term, the imaginary friend, all of this is presented in such an appealing unbelievable way it almost makes your own memories and thoughts make more sense to you. This actually made more sense to me explaining how memories worked than the typical physiological processes that happen in your body with physiology. Well done Pixar.<br/><br/>While the movie was good, like I said earlier it was not amazing. The strength of this movie was behind the scenes in Riley's head. The imaginative things that happened behind the scenes with the emotions and the memories and all of the other crew responsible for maintaining Riley's thought processes were the most entertaining part of this film. The emotions were just okay. Amy Poehler's voice was fine but nothing amazing. And while all of the other voice performances were not horrible, I really thought nothing stood out. I think if there were some different voice actors, or the dialogue was better or fresher it would have made a difference here for sure."

","I find it confusing how almost everyone are crazy for it. Yes, it's good but very typical and not the quality Pixar often creates. I just can't accept that many are saying that this is Pixar's best because it is far from it. The concept was quite impressive but it could have been executed way better. It was brilliant, yes, but not very heartwarming and unforgettable. The animation was okay but I didn't like Joy's look especially her blue hair because it wasn't very gleeful and she didn't shine among other emotions. What I didn't like most was Joy and Anger's journey back to headquarters because it seemed long and unending. I get the effort of capturing not only the children's heart but also the adults' but this is where they failed because the movie wasn't appealing to children but more on adults. Pixar forgot who their first priority should be because even though it looked like a kid's movie it was more directed to adults and that I think was a big problem because most parents only went to see this because of their children. Now, you may wonder why I still gave this an 8 because I sounded like I hate it but really it was better than Cars and Brave so it was deserving of an 8. And of course, it was made by Pixar so I am a bit bias. It has strong points but perhaps it was just overshadowed by my unmet 100-story expectation. Overall, I think Pixar was back on track the day MU was shown and this Inside Out was their bump along the way. I can't wait to see it again and who knows maybe this is all just a mistake and it truly deserves 11/10."

","Highly imaginative, highly inventive, poignant and touching film from Pixar effectively recalls the sheer enjoyment and innovation of early studio efforts. Set in the mind of an innocent young girl, the film focuses on her five personified emotions (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger) who inhabit her mental ""Headquarters"" as they guide her through the various phases of her life. Things take an especially tumultuous turn when the girl's parents uproot her from the Midwest to the California coast, for the first time causing her to encounter loneliness, isolation, and other difficulties. Trying the best way they can, the emotions bond together to guide her, but not without complications and very surprising results. Pixar, having rightfully earned its reputation for creativity and storytelling savvy, is able to redeem some of its previously underwhelming efforts with this sweet, sincere, unpredictable and extremely well-crafted tale that is sure to touch both children and adults alike. The story goes in many different directions (at times too many for its own good), but delivers with ingenious animation, dazzling voice work, and a heartfelt central theme. ***"

","""Inside Out"" is another emotional home run for Pixar Studios. While it may be just a tad too long, it's a mostly flawless film. It represents everything we have come to know and love from Pixar. The characters are incredibly funny, the script is superb, and the animation is as great as ever. At it's core is allot of heart. The best family films are ones where everyone gets something out of it. I think parents who go to see this with their kids will enjoy this just as much as they will. It's a special movie that speaks to the heart and soul of all humans.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what makes a Pixar film work are the sentiments. Inside Out has plenty of that. Director Pete Docter does a fantastic job with this one. i remember his previous Pixar projects. He rally captures that magic and heartwarming feeling in his direction. However, to have a great Pixar movie, you have to have a great script as well. This film does. Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and Ronnie del Carmen all come together to form this amazing script. All of the dialogue is well written, and once again, hilarious. There are so many good jokes, and none of them really fall flat. Above all ,the characters work perfectly, making this one of the best Pixar films ever made. The animation is unique and stunning to look at, and the score by Michael Giacchino is beautiful and fun."

","From animals having feelings, to technology having feelings, to even toys having feelings, Inside Out continues the trend with feelings having feelings. Its release in 2015 was more than anticipating with its general audience being young children.
 The movie started off with the birth of the main character, Riley. With that, it included how when each person is born, so are their emotions. Fear, Disgust, Anger, Sadness, and Joy, who was the first to appear. As Riley grew up, each of her emotions appeared as well of the making of each of her core memories. Everything begins to switch up and get off track when Riley and her parents move from Minnesota to San Francisco. From there Riley begins to experience different feelings such as low self esteem and low confidence.
 The story was setting off to the viewers what goes on in young children's minds. A move for example, as used in the movie, can effect a child greatly, mentally."

","This cartoon film I consider to be the best in all cartoon production. When I started to look at it, it was not at all clear to me how with the help of just five emotions it is possible to describe a human feeling. But the creators of this masterpiece it turned out incomparably. Of course, a person has more emotions, but if you show each one, then you need to shoot the series for a huge number of episodes. Although, this is not a bad idea. Each of the presented emotions is perfectly and very accurately shown. I am more than anyone, I liked Sadness. Strange, but true. When her joy dragged her leg, and she lamented, I laughed without stopping. I was also struck by a very precise moment with the erasure of telephone numbers in my memory. When I thought about it, I realized that I would not remember a single number of my friends. And remember in childhood, as we called each other, dialing numbers from memory.

Inside her mind are different characters that represent varying emotions. You sometimes get a glimpse into the mother and father's mind too, which make for a good laugh. Inside Out is an outstanding portrait of the human condition, what makes us tick, and how our emotions tend to play off of one another. The vocal talents of the cast gave sincere emotion to the characters. The plot and animation was perfect and kept me interested throughout the movie.

","I should probably start this review with mentioning that I did not get to see the original English version of Inside Out but a dubbed one rather. I don't know how that affects my experience of it but here we go.<br/><br/>I don't want to go into plot details as the trailers avoided all that so I'll just say that Inside Out is a movie about growing up and loss. The two things that always seem to go together.<br/><br/>This movie drove me to tears. And judging from the other reviews I was not the only one. Yet, as I drove home, and looked back I realised that the story wasn't that great. There was nothing particularly striking about it. So why was I so in love with it by the end credits? Why was it such a kick in the emotions? Some part of me fears it will not stand the test of time.<br/><br/>What will ultimately happen is that you will see Inside Out and it will either touch you deeply or it won't.

"pinkarray","6","3","23","7 July 2015"," It's no Up
","After Pete Doctor's better film, ""Up"" comes this, where people were taking it that it may be Pixar's best idea ever. While the concept is enjoyable, it does have some characters that ranged from bad (Bing Bong, Riley's parents, Joy) okay (Riley, Anger) to great (Disgust, Sadness). I did like Riley as a toddler but as she grew up, she became too playful and typical for me. I also didn't think some of the emotions mirrored Riley's personality like how Fear gets scared easily because he's simply fear. And how Sadness cried over reflecting on Riley's memories.<br/><br/>The movie was so complex that I was constantly zoning out, trying to figure out what's going on. It made me feel like I had to watch the movie again to figure out what this world that Riley had was about. I thought that it may have lingered on the emotions part a little too much, I liked how it swung back and forth from the real world to the emotions' world to show how Riley was doing.<br/><br/>I found a lot of moments funny.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was made by the same guy who made the music for Up. While the scenes may not have been as sad as Up, they were still making me hold back my tears.<br/><br/>The middle act was when things got worse. The pacing was rather off and It got very sentimental, it had Riley finally crying to her parents, telling them how she missed Minnesota and Joy crying when she misses all the good times with Riley. But she had to understand that she needed sadness, too. And Riley was a bad kid for running away and taking her parents' credit card. And also, it showed Bing Bong, an annoying imaginary friend who cries candies.<br/><br/>It also ended abruptly, where Riley is 12 and she has finally adapted to San Francisco. I wish that I could see how she adapts to San Francisco.<br/><br/>I had to talk to my parents to try to understand the movie and I understand it's not supposed to be about Riley and that Pixar usually makes emotional movies but it was still too sentimental.<br/><br/>Hopefully, there will be a sequel explaining all of the new islands she had and how she'll grow from a teenager, becoming an old lady to show what life is like as you struggle to grow up.<br/><br/>The animation was pretty good except Riley's nose was too big, and the voice acting was fine while Riley's newcomer (Kaitlyn Dias) was okay."

","I had been looking forward to Inside Out for years. Pixar is my favorite animation studio, Pete Docter is my favorite Pixar director, and I love Amy Poehler's acting. Consequently, I expected much from Inside Out--and I'm happy to say those expectations were met.<br/><br/>The story follows 11-year old Riley Henderson (Kaitlyn Dias), whose life turns upside down when her family suddenly moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. But the story doesn't focus on Riley; rather, it focuses on the emotions inside her head. It's a bold concept and could have easily backfired, but Pixar pulls the film off with stunning flair.<br/><br/>The voice actors fit their roles perfectly. Amy Poehler exudes optimism and excitability as Joy; she's perkier than Leslie Knope, and that's saying something. The Office alumni Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling are terrific as Sadness and Disgust, respectively; Sadness makes Eeyore pale in comparison and Disgust is a disgruntled fashionista. Lewis Black is a riot as Anger and SNL's Bill Hader is a pleasant surprise as Fear.<br/><br/>Visually this movie is flawless, featuring gorgeous colors and beautiful backgrounds.<br/><br/>And the writing, as you'd expect from Pixar, is top-notch. It's funny, heartbreaking, and original.<br/><br/>My only complaint (and it is minor) is that Pixar perhaps tried to cram too many ideas.<br/><br/>Inside Out should be a shoo-in for best animated feature of 2015. I wouldn't be surprised to see it break the ultimate glass ceiling either--first animated feature to win Best Picture."

While I see that Pixar is still far ahead of the competition at storytelling and trying to answer in advance the most random question a little child can have, I feel that we're losing something here.<br/><br/>It's the first Pixar movie in a while that's too childish. I found too many scenes in the movie that were developed for easy laughing - it seemed that DreamWorks was haunting the place with canned kid-jokes ready to attack. This was kind of a let down since it's not what we've been waiting for Pixar's movie. In the end, this unexpected irrelevant laughing material might me a request by Disney, to make Inside Out more a movie for *all* ages and not just for +5.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the concepts were still portrayed genuinely.

","This was a joy to watch. The emotion is definitely there, mostly because it comes in a way that all of us can really relate to, in terms of specific scenarios that we are seeing play out on the screen and remembering when they happened in our own lives. This was a good film... but just one day later, and I'm liking it less and less. I think the overall theme and the beginning and ending is fantastic. But I think its second act proves to be really problematic. The film starts to have things happen for the sake of entertainment and humor, without really having a purpose to the overall storyline. This happens with all children's films, but for some reason it was more noticeable here. Some of the humor was kind of childish in a way that's more immature than anything.

Everything about it was excellent--voice casting, character design, the look and feel--although I will need more viewings to decide how some of the story elements hold up, as there were sequences that went by very quickly. There was nothing too heavy or inappropriate, but because of its complexity, I don't recommend it for younger viewers.

The peak into the human mind and seeing each emotion and watching as memories are created and stored is stellar screen writing. The emotions of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear are given life as real characters who steer the young girl Riley, who's life we follow from birth to age 13. It takes great imagination to write a story like this and I applaud Pixar for this one.

This movie is something I haven't seen before. It surprised me right off the start. The idea of emotions portrayed in this way and the way the showed a few scenes, it just blew my mind, especially when you compare your life experiences to first scenes in this movie. Inside Out surely isn't flawless, and my rating (7/10) is definitely not high, and that's because the movie started out great, and when it got to half of the movie, it went down slowly when it reached the point that I was actually getting annoyed (More or less when the protagonist fell into the pit)- Hope this is not a spoiler. What's great though is that from there the movie just accelerated as if it wanted to go back on its track. And that I loved. It was a great ending (Which in my opinion also opens to a second movie), great voice over(s) and I only gave this rating because I wouldn't want to watch this movie twice. It's one of those movies that if watched twice, they're just not as better."
"kingbk-2","7","3","24","3 January 2016"," Both Overrated and Underrated by Reviewers
","This movie seems to be getting reviews that are very high and others that are very low. I'd rank it on the higher side. It's one of the better Pixar movies that has been released, but I'm not sure I'd call it one of their best movies ever released.<br/><br/>The movie stars Riley, a 12 year old girl from Minnesota who one day out of the blue has to move to San Francisco for her Dad's new job. The five emotions in her brain aren't sure how they should react to this and instead there is a battle for the control panel for how she should respond. Leader Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), tries to keep her happy, while Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), normally content with staying in the background, wants more control. This leads to both Joy and Sadness being sent via a tube to the depths of Riley's memory, while the other three emotions Fear, Anger and Disgust (voiced by Bill Hader, Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling respectively), must try to get Riley through each day in her new home full of unfamiliarity. <br/><br/>If you watch the special features, Writer/Director Pete Doctor admits that they struggled for a while to come up with a story to fit along this theme. Watching the film closely, you get that vibe throughout. It almost feels like an incomplete film. We don't get to know Riley all that well besides some scenes here and there where we see that she loves her friends, family, hockey, goofing off, and being honest. The movie has the challenge of creating conflict without a true villain. This is a great change from the usual Disney fare, but also ends up putting together a story where the obstacles aren't that overwhelming. The themes of ""it's OK to be sad"" and ""emotions aren't cut and dry, but mixed"" are great lessons to learn, but too many times I felt I was watching ""Herman's Head"" or a story that just needed a couple more things to make it more interesting and not so bland and flat. <br/><br/>The characters are just not that likable. The parents are standard Mom and Dad, who have a very generic relationship with Riley. Joy is annoying, but so is Sadness. However, I found the three other emotions enjoyable because we didn't see them as much, so when we did, they did a good job at comic relief, etc. Bing bong, the imaginary friend, is probably the best character in this whole movie as a reminder of the imagination we have as kids and how the older you get, the more it fades away. <br/><br/>I like the lessons the movie gives, the animation was beautiful, the soundtrack was wonderful, and it has moments of brilliance, but at the same time there were too many moments where more could have been added to flush out the story and give it more of a unique twist and make it not so paint by the numbers. I still think it's one of the better Pixar movies, but not one of their best."

","This was a new Pixar experience for me, actually. I like Pixar and are almost always impressed by how they can make humor work on many different levels, for young and grown-ups at the same time. Inside out, however, is not an all out ha-ha comedy, as many (if not all) of the other Pixar movies are. Still funny, but there is more room and food for thought in this one, and above all, there is a beauty to it. It is a balanced movie, with humor, about growing up. About growing to accept that life is a mix of feelings, and that that enhances memories. That life isn't clear cut, but complex. And Pixar handles that really well too, in addition to the humor. Even more impressive."

All of them were different and so cute. And Bing Bong, a creature created by Riley's imagination, were so cute too. And the journey of Joy, Sad and Bing Bong were interesting too. Following it, we realize many things around us that sometimes we forget: our family, our friend, beautiful life, our passion, our imagination....

","As a psychology student I was very intrigued to watch this movie. I had heard a lot (positive) about it, so my expectations were high, and although it was different than expected, it was also fulfilling my expectations. Of course it is simplifying the way our brain works, but I think they still did a great job representing certain faculties of our brain.<br/><br/>What I think was also great were the characters, they weren't flat, but you can definitely see how Joy and Sadness develop throughout the movie. I also love that in a way the movie contains two plots that are however intertwined in a very unusually close way. I also love that the movie shows how different feelings interact with each other and how sad moments can have something happy and valuable to them, while other happy moments might have a sad touch as well.<br/><br/>Finally, I think that it is not inappropriate for children, as some people have stated here. I think people underestimate how capable children are of understanding these kind of things. Especially young children, they understand on a different level, but sometimes even better than some adults do. I love that this movie is not promoting any kind of consumer goods, like sugary food or certain role images (a girl that is into ice hockey, love it!) which is what other movies still need to learn!"

Starring in this movie are Amy Poehler (Parks and Recreation), Phyllis Smith (The Office), Bill Hader (Saturday Night Live), Mindy Kaling (The Office, The Mindy Project), and Lewis Black (American comedian, Accepted).<br/><br/>Inside Out is a movie more enjoyable than I thought it would be. It excels as a kids film in that it not only is designed with the intention of being a family friendly movie, but also being one that helps kids to understand something important about themselves through an understandable and concise plot. This movie centers around the emotional turmoil that takes place inside Riley's head when she relocates to a new town. Moving is stressful for anyone no matter what age you're at. For an 11-year-old, however, moving translates to getting used to a new school, having to make new friends, and finding new ways to keep up with your hobbies and interests. Dealing with all of that is a very large amount of change for someone young to experience. Through the emotions in Riley's head we see her slowly trying to acclimate to the new environment she's in, but as the movie goes on it's more than apparent that it's very difficult for Riley to see where she is as her new home. From here we are taken on a journey that tells us, the audience, that the feelings and emotions we have are important and definitely teaches kids that it's okay to not always experience joy or happiness in times of hardship.<br/><br/>Read The Rest At http://www.dimthelightsfilmblog.com"
"joseruiperez","9","3","24","14 November 2015"," Inside Out: A Metaphor about How to Interpret Emotions in our Lives
","When a movie besides entertainment, is visually attractive and has a good script, it is definitely a success; when this film is also able to teach us a lesson of life and invites us to reflect, it is a wonder.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE:<br/><br/>Inside out, disguised as an animation film ""apparently"" for a child audience, tells the story of a girl and what happens with their emotions based on different events in her life. However, although suitable and enjoyable for any audience, in the face of a critical look we can find many metaphors about life itself and a deep insight into how the human emotional system works, and even we can find the influence of today's society, that often invites us to feel constantly happy.<br/><br/>EMOTIONAL SYSTEM:<br/><br/>It seems that humans and most animals come with a set of basic emotions. Some authors divide those in primary emotions (anger, joy, fear and sadness) and secondary (love, surprise, shame and disgust). These emotions are what help us in the task of understanding how we feel about the actions that happen or occur around us, and act accordingly to them. It is a reaction that thinking from an evolutionary point probably helped us (and help us still) to survive, in fact, the emergence of emotions is usually accompanied by somatic responses of the body as change of the blood pressure or release of various hormones by glands. However, presently, there are cases that may pose more of a handicap than a real advantage. One of the most common examples in today's society is ""glossophobia"" or fear of public speaking, apparently in today's society presents no evolutionary benefit, rather the opposite.<br/><br/>From a physiological point of view, the generation of emotions has been linked to the model of ""triune brain"" proposed by Paul MacLean. The limbic system, known as the ""old mammalian brain"" is the origin of emotions and instincts, especially the amygdala, which is considered a primary structure facing the management of emotions as well as the hypothalamus, which is responsible for vegetative changes accompanying emotions, and to finally store the information obtained through emotions in the hippocampus. Moreover, the neocortex, which is part of the most developed mammals, is responsible for more complex actions such as reasoning or abstract thinking. Specifically the prefrontal and frontal lobes are responsible for managing and coordinating such emotional reactions trying to slow down the limbic system.<br/><br/>EMOTIONAL ANALOGY IN THE MOVIE:<br/><br/>In movie we can see some animated characters playing the role of basic emotions such as Happiness, Fear, Sadness, Anger and Disgust. Everything seems to be emotionally right on course for Riley, until her family suddenly decides to move and that emotionally destabilized her. In the following lines I make references to some ideas that are narrated in the movie (if you have not watched it yet, do not keep going!). These ideas have from my perspective a direct association with real life, the personality of the individual as well as their values and emotions.<br/><br/><ul><li>""That is fear, he is good at making Riley be safe"". This thought invites us to think what I said previously, fear kept us alive evolutionarily speaking - The main memories that are mentioned in the film can be viewed as a similarity of those events that have marked and have had a strong influence on our personality and future steps. - ""Personality islands are what make Riley Riley"" The islands are those values or activities that characterize a person and its personality, we see that as these islands are ""disconnecting"" in the film, Riley ceases to be herself, turning into a soulless child. - And once the night falls and we start sleeping, all our memories of the day pass to the area of long-term memories, that is, our daily events are becoming part of our experience. - Finally memories that have lost their importance, fade and can not be remembered Those things that once were important, slowly degrade and disappear. - The whole mess starts when Happiness tries to prevent a sad main memory from being introduced in the system of emotions of Riley (this can be associated with a situation where we try to remove feelings like sadness or anger, rather than understand them). - Finally, Happiness realizes that some happy memories had its beginning in a sad situation, what helps her to understand that sadness is as necessary as happiness. Finally and from my opinion, it is sadness from the idea of missing her family which leads her to decide not to run away.</li></ul><br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS:<br/><br/>Following the reflections of the film and keeping the idea of ​​how our brain works and has worked from an evolutionary point of view, emotions help us understand how we feel towards both internal and external events that happen to us. Emotions can be mixed and one can lead to another, it is common to see how an event can trigger one initial emotion, which gradually evolves and turns into another. Society invites us to be single-emotionals and be always happy, but that is not the case and it is probably not even healthy and deprives us of the possibility of understanding how we feel. In fact, authors as Plutchik have begun to introduce these ideas in recent years. But it is also negative to hang on to emotions and do not let them pass. We all have met people who are wrapped with a hatress halo or have an aura of sadness (depressed); and they might even try to make you feel the same. Emotions play an important role in who we are, in our daily path and to be able tot ake us where we are heading. They are a powerful tool, but also extremely dangerous, you have to accept, understand and act according to what you have learned through them."

","Inside Out is a movie that's fun-filled with awesome characters, great setting, wonderful story and realistic situations. The story tells of Riley and the experiences she'll get when she moves to San Francisco. The story quickly transitions to the stage of puberty, wherein all the emotions try to take over and control the console. The real story begins when Joy and Sadness get separated from the group and try their best to return to Mind Headquarters to restore the damage they've done. With all the bumps and twists they'll come along, I assure you, its pure comedy, pure action, pure entertainment for the whole family. The characters have great personalities and are all suited for the story. Final verdict: This movie is sure to touch your heart,entertain the mind and make you cry (like 3 times)."
"illinoisparkie","8","3","24","30 August 2015"," Well written and deserving of its critical praise
","A very enjoyable, thought-provoking movie. Credit goes to the screenwriters for clearly setting up their imaginary world and juxtaposing between the reality of young Riley and the ""reality"" of her inner emotions. While the movie probably would be hard for kids to follow, I think it is terrific for teens and adults. Its message of the need for some sadness to make one appreciate the joy in life is pretty profound for any movie, let alone a ""cartoon"".<br/><br/>The animation of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust was particularly impressive. Notice how in some closeups of their faces there is a slight fuzziness and transparency, contrasting with the more solid forms of Riley's world. The sight gags and one-liners during the journey of Joy and Sadness to get back to ""head""quarters were funny and clever but never pulled you out of the story.<br/><br/>I know Amy Poehler has gotten a lot of praise for her voice work on Joy but Phyllis Smith as Sadness stole the movie for me.<br/><br/>I will say my family didn't enjoy it as much as I did but I believe it deserves the praise it has gotten. Although it did drag a bit in places, I can certainly see it getting recognition during the awards season, not only for Best Animated Feature but also for Best Picture, Original Screenplay, Director, Production Design and some other technical awards.<br/><br/>The short cartoon, Lava, shown before Inside Out was not the studio's best effort. Set to a Hawaiian story and told in song, it sounded like a leftover scene from Lilo and Stitch and went on about two verses too long.<br/><br/>Stick around for the early end credits of Inside Out. There are some priceless bits in there. Well done Disney and Pixar."
"Rickting","8","3","24","24 August 2015"," A return to form for Pixar
","After the overrated and underwhelming Toy Story 3, genuinely bad Cars 2, mediocre Brave and good but forgettable Monsters University, Pixar have bounced back with this emotional tale about the feelings inside a young girl's head trying to navigate the girl moving to a new house and school. Another excellent premise from Pixar, it is used well and the result is moving and heartfelt. While not a flawless film, Inside Out is a very good animated film and one of the more sophisticated ones from recent times. As always the visuals are gorgeous and the film is rendered wonderfully while the direction is also top form. As can be expected from Pixar the script has emotion, big laughs and thrills which it wrings out of its fascinating premise to maximum effect. There are many funny bits, especially involving the Anger character and there's a considerable amount of suspense involved to. The world inside the girl's head is brilliantly thought out and successfully brought to life.<br/><br/>IO is not a complete success and while certainly a return to form, has been overpraised slightly. For such a complex premise, the film is too short and as the little girl, Riley, sinks into a depression the film moves too quickly towards her deciding to run away. This rushed approach reduces the emotional impact of the movie although during the third act the film hits the emotional beats and it hits them well. This is definitely going to make people cry. The climax of the film doesn't involve action which is interesting and the voice acting is excellent, but earlier Pixar films were kids movies for grown ups and grown up movies for kids. This is a kids movie for grown ups. It's too downbeat and serious for young kids to relate to properly so this is a very good film, but it's not a very good family film. Although rushed and overly downbeat much of the time, IO is ultimately an emotional success and proves that Pixar have plenty of life left in them yet.<br/><br/>8/10"
"secondtake","7","3","24","6 August 2015"," Great fun, often creative, but also a bit plastic and dumbed down at times
","Inside Out (2015)<br/><br/>Totally fun, with some semi-serious analysis of how our brains work for a kid to absorb. And heck, maybe some adults, too. The story of a girl adjusting to moving to a new city and a new life is layered with a fanciful view of psychology. It's good stuff.<br/><br/>I didn't find it as mind-blowing (so to speak) or inventive as many seem to, having read a few reviews out there. The clichés here are expected and almost necessary (the types of people playing aspects of personality, for example). So that's fine. But the larger story of adjustment is painted in very ordinary ways, hitting the usual trigger points without much creativity. I'm not talking the in-the-brain stuff, which is totally great in a Bugs Bunny kinds of great crazy way, but the outside story.<br/><br/>I also don't really like this kind of animation—it's not as cartoony as, say, two of my favorites, ""Monsters Inc."" and ""The Incredibles,"" both by Pixar. And it's not over-realistic as some animated/CGI inventions are (from ""Avatar"" to ""Polar Express""). So the characters (the daughter and her parents, mainly, but everyone, top to bottom) are kind of plasticky fake/real. The personalities also have that Disney kind of white-washed blandness that seems quaint on the surface but is empty and predictable and a bit off-putting at the same time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie and it would be hard not to. And maybe this kind of children's film, or young adult film, should be aove serious criticism. But if it does warrant critique, and comparison to other animated features, it falls short. That's fair enough. <br/><br/>Finally, it does have some totally brilliant moments, especially when it shows the insides of other people's (and animal's) brains. Notice how the audience really (and finally) comes awake and laughs with a roar at this! Now that's great filmmaking. Too bad it's just a few minutes of the total."
"themadmovieman","9","3","24","25 June 2015"," Pixar is back on form!
","This is the Pixar that we know and love! The past four years have been a bit of a down period filled with unoriginal sequels and somewhat boring ideas, but this film puts the legendary company back on form with one of the most original, entertaining and emotional films you'll see all year.<br/><br/>On the face of things, this is a bit of a confusing concept that shouldn't really work, because it has to intertwine differing story lines between inside the head, and outside the head. However, this takes this incredibly original concept and shows it off ingeniously, effortlessly blending the two stories together, and making for a stunningly entertaining and fascinating watch throughout.<br/><br/>Let's start with the fact that, for kids, I think that this is the best Pixar film of all. It's full of great personalities, vibrant colours, amazingly imaginative worlds and ideas from start to finish, and for the little ones, this will be like one brilliant roller-coaster play set like they've never seen before.<br/><br/>However, there's so much more in this film beyond the kids' stuff. This is probably Pixar's most thoughtful and insightful production, because it really makes you think about your own emotions and your own memories from when you were younger in a more personal and relatable way that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>As a result, this is at times devastatingly emotional, and appropriately so. Whether it's playing on beautiful nostalgia or just extreme sadness, this film is a real tear-jerker, and not at all in the conventional sense, because it really taps into your emotions and gives a deep perspective on what is going on inside your head, and in a way that is as convincing as anything.<br/><br/>Away from the powerful emotion of the story, it's still massively entertaining. It's a laugh-a-minute fest from start to finish, with excellent comedy throughout that will be enjoyable for everyone.<br/><br/>The voice cast is incredible too. Amy Poehler does a great job at being as upbeat as possible as Joy, Phyllis Smith is a hilarious and convincing Sadness, whilst Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader and Lewis Black are all perfect as supporting emotions Disgust, Fear and Anger.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm giving this a 9 because it's a stunningly original film with the deep heart and emotion coupled with the brilliant humour and fun that Pixar has always been famous for."
"ayoreinf","7","3","24","21 June 2015"," Well, Sadness is a necessary emotion, did I just spend 94 minutes to learn that?
","I know' this review will be torn to shreds by most of you other reviewers and readers, as this has long turned into a highest praise competition. A competition I can't join, since personally I was sourly disappointed. This movie, is not as original as most of the viewers claim if you really think so go and check out an early 90s series called Herman's Head, in which we saw the story develops inside Herman's head where four characters controlled his behaviour, basically sensitivity, lust, fear and intellect. A much better division than the five almost randomly picked emotions chosen here.But originality is not the issue here, I said more than once that I don't rate originality as is so very highly, and if this was a good story I wouldn't mind a second hand idea and a random choice of emotions. This is not a good story, I find it hard to explain why without adding a spoiler, but I'm willing to explain my point in details to whomever will challenge me to do so by mail or via the IMDb message box. I promise to answer each and every one no matter how many there will be. All I can say here that we do get high drama, with some very inventive ideas and some very high quality performances, especially so Richard Kind and Phyllis Smith, but almost everyone here does the job to the highest standards. And still it all ends with a whimper, without any real resolution taking place on screen. Yes life goes on is a true statement, but it's not the reason we all came to see this movie. Not with all the hype that preceded. And I still think Up and Wall-E were true masterpieces, not just as animation but as movies by any standard. This one isn't. It's an extended pilot to a new TV series where the idea that life goes on would feel right, but then we won't need all this extra drama and meandering plot line."
"CleveMan66","7","3","24","19 June 2015"," ""Inside Out"" is wonderfully original and incredibly imaginative, but unremarkable in some areas.
","The mind is a complicated, confusing, contradictory place. But it's also a unique mix of emotions, memories and thoughts which make each of us who we are. Wouldn't it be interesting to actually see how all that stuff between our ears works? Interesting, but also helpful and even cathartic. And, potentially, a lot of fun too. Those are the ideas behind the animated comedy-drama ""Inside Out"" (PG, 1:34) from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures.<br/><br/>Riley Anderson is a human being (well, an animated version of one anyway). More specifically, she's an 11-year-old girl, but that's almost beside the point. Her gender and her age have a lot to do with how her emotions cause her to think, feel and behave, but the movie makes the point that the way her mind actually works is driven by the humanity that she shares with all of us. Her feelings are controlled by the interplay of five main emotions, each personified with their own physical characteristics, their own hue and their own role to play in her life. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is a yellowish sprite who keeps Riley's spirits up – and is Riley's ruling emotion. Disgust (Mindy Kaling) is a green, eye-rolling fashionista who protects Riley's social life, Fear (Bill Hader) is purple and nebbish and protects Riley from physical harm, while Anger (Lewis Black) is a stocky, red munchkin who protects Riley from unfairness in her life. Last and least is Sadness (Phyllis Smith), a short, round blue figure in a turtle-neck sweater who doesn't really seem to have a purpose. Somehow, these five work together to achieve balance in Riley's emotional life and help her function on a daily basis.<br/><br/>In living her life, Riley makes memories in the form of glass-like orbs. Most of these memories (each orb literally colored to show which emotion is dominant in that memory) roll down tubes into the massive storeroom of long-term memories. The most important memories, those that really define Riley's life, are core memories which reside in the ""control room"" of Riley's mind and power her islands of personality. 11-year-old Riley has five such islands – Goofball Island (she is a kid after all), Hockey Island (reflecting her favorite pastime), Honesty Island (her most significant characteristic), Friendship Island and, of course, Family Island. But as a complex human being, that's not quite all there is to it. Her mind has areas for imagination, facts and opinions, abstract thought and dream / nightmare production. She also has a vast abyss for memories that are no longer important and, working in that warehouse-like archive of long-term memories, a couple ""Forgetters"" who decide which memories to keep and which to discard. Each area of Riley's mind is both necessary and dangerous, but I won't say more because seeing how Pixar has imagined and animated each of these areas is a large part of enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>As great an idea and as wonderfully realized as it is, this movie wouldn't be much without a good story – and this film definitely has one. After we see Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) form many wonderful memories (most of which are contained in orbs colored yellow), she is removed from the place where those memories were created when her parents (Kyle McLachlan and Diane Lane) move the family from Minnesota to San Francisco. A delayed moving van and a tenuous job situation stress out her parents, while the normal adjustments of leaving behind friends and starting in a new school has Riley's emotions working overtime. Tensions rise among the emotions until a struggle between Joy and Sadness result in both – along with many of Riley's core memories – getting sucked into a long tube and out of the control room. As Disgust, Fear and Anger are left to run Riley's mind, Joy and Sadness have to work together in a wild and strange journey through her brain, trying to get back to the control room, before the other three emotions mess things up too much – and before Riley loses her way. As Riley's personality islands begin to crumble into her mind's abyss, Joy and Sadness learn that they each have much to learn about themselves and each other and they have to figure out new ways to work together, for the sake of all concerned. In addition to the inner workings of Riley's mind, we get a glimpse into the minds of each of her parents and minds as diverse as those of a birthday party clown, a bus driver, a pizza maker, a dog and a cat.<br/><br/>As advertised, ""Inside Out"" is wonderfully original and incredibly imaginative. If you're having trouble picturing all this, try to imagine a colorful, animated combination of ""Fantastic Voyage"", ""Mermaids"", ""Toy Story"", ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""San Andreas"". Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain, but trust me, it's quite a sight – and pretty thought-provoking too. Unfortunately, I can't quite turn myself inside out praising the movie. The voice acting is very good, but nothing special. The animation is state-of-the-art but isn't what I would call ""remarkable"" and is probably not worth the extra couple of bucks for 3-D glasses. The film contains very funny and genuinely touching moments, but they are few and far between. While the filmmakers have clearly put considerable effort into realizing their vision, more effort should have gone into the actual script. The concepts explored are a little cerebral for a kids' movie, while the dialog isn't cerebral enough. In short, the film is hindered a bit by a lackluster script and unremarkable animation and voice work, but deserves high marks for its creativity and, in that department, definitely lives up to its billing. The main emotion that ""Inside Out"" activated in my mind's control room is Joy and this film will live in my long-term memory for many years to come. ""B+"""
"jbroc62","9","3","24","19 June 2015"," Inside Out: The Genius Answer to What Goes On Inside Our Heads
","I've been a fan of Pixar for a long time now, and they've made some of my favorite films ever: The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, just to name a few. However, Pixar has been falling behind the progress that Disney Animation Studios has been making as of late, and I was wondering if they had run out of the fresh, thought- provoking ideas that have consistently made their films so memorable. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Inside Out might the best film Pixar has ever made. And if it's not, it's definitely among their best films for sure.<br/><br/>Inside Out (directed and created by Pete Doctor, director and creator of Up and Monster's Inc.) centers on an eleven year-old girl named Riley and the emotions - Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Sadness - that run around inside her head. When Riley's family decides to move from Minnesota to San Fransisco, with a new home, new school, and new friends, Riley's emotions conflict with each other on how Riley should feel about the situation. That's all you need to know going into this film, because knowing as little as possible about the film made my experience all the more memorable. <br/><br/>As with all other Pixar films, the animation is smooth and the production design is beautiful. This film meets all the technical expectations that all other Pixar films meet, and that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. All the acting in this film is fantastic; Amy Poehler (Joy), Bill Hader (Fear), Lewis Black (Anger), Mindy Kaling (Disgust), and Phyllis Smith (Sadness) all do exceptional work. <br/><br/>But really, this film ended up being much more mature than I was anticipating. And I'm not going to lie, I don't usually cry in movies, but I cried twice in this film twice. It really gets under the psyche of not only what it's really like going through adolescence as a young kid who finally realizes that the world is so much bigger than he/she once thought it was, but questions about all of these things that suddenly become possible in this new world; fear of what could happen, disgust at what they don't understand, anger when things don't go as planned, sadness when they're in the worst possible situation, and joy when they realize that what happens happens for a reason, and life continues to go on despite all of this. <br/><br/>Colorful, thought-provoking and emotionally resonant, Inside Out is a film the kids will love for the imaginative world created inside Riley's mind, but adults will appreciate even more for a mature, fascinating look at growing up and accepting that youth is only a temporary part of one's life. This film represents the best of what Pixar has to offer, what Pixar once was, and what Pixar still is today. Everyone should not only consider seeing this film, but everyone NEEDS to see this film, because Inside Out is the best film I've seen all year."
"MattBirk","8","3","24","19 June 2015"," Pixar returns to being the King of Animation!
","Fans can rejoice, Inside Out is the return to former glory for Pixar. This time, Pixar makes up the long absence with an ingenious idea about how the interworkings of a child's mind comes to be. The humor is great (though quite a bit is geared more towards children) and the emotional notes, of course, drive the movie. Pixar not only tells us what is important to an eleven-year-old, but they also show us why it is important.<br/><br/>The movie really explores the odd mood swings of young adult and how all emotions are more or less unbalanced. A child is unpredictable and irrational and all of that is shown here in spades, Joy tries to remain in control, but all the other emotions fight for the spotlight. And that is part of the brilliance of Inside Out, we see how zany a child's mind can be when compared to the rational mind of an adult (who shares the controls with other emotions equally). Not only are we shown the importance of emotions, but we see the interworkings of a child's mind, from the importance of friends and family to an imaginary friend. Pixar leaves no stone unturned, everything you could imagine about the brain/mind is explored in great detail. And that is what makes the movie so magical, we have never seen something like this before. Imagination Land, long term vs short term memory, dream productions, subconscious, and so much more shine bright here. It's a marvel to see the entire 'world' within the mind played out in front of us.<br/><br/>Inside Out will easily win the Best Animated Film Oscar this year (if not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture) and go down as the return of Pixar being the King of animation. It has everything we have come to love about Pixar films, it's funny for both kids and adults and hits an emotional cord for people of all ages. Though, this isn't the best Pixar film to date (not even in my top five), but it is certainly their most clever and imaginative yet!"

When I got out my emotions had been through the rinse cycle and I'm still drying them out. But that's *okay*. <br/><br/>In the beginning, you feel awe for the good stuff and then bad thing after bad thing happens. You try to find Joy, but Sadness keeps getting in the way. When these tiny emotions peer out of Riley's eyes, they're as unsure as she is. Because they *are* her. Little by little you start to feel connected with them. This is a very big story on such a very small scale. <br/><br/>Tissues are a must, I had tears thick in my eyes, my breath hitched in my throat (out of embarrassment) and I was literally having snot coming out of my nose... it was so good-sad. <br/><br/>The movie didn't drag for me at all; I really did find myself thoroughly enjoying a Pixar film from start to finish.

"patricklfriedman","9","3","25","9 October 2015"," Likes and dislikes of Inside Out
","Riley is an eleven year old girl that is learning how to deal with her emotions. In inside out these emotions are actually characters that live inside Riley. They work every day at headquarters. Joy, Anger, Sadness, disgust, and fear. In the beginning of the movie the emotions seem to have very good control and work seems easy. When Riley has to move however, these emotions take on a big challenge. Many other emotions besides joy get a bigger workload. This is Riley trying to deal with her new environment. Joy is our protagonist in the movie. The conflict she reaches is getting lost in different departments of Riley. She views sadness as bad memories and therefore does not want sadness to influence Riley's memories. By the time Joy and Sadness make it back to headquarters Riley has figured something out. She had realized that sadness is a necessity in Riley's life. She also realized that joy is usually short to follow right after. This movie was a great depiction of what goes on in an eleven year old girl's brain. Riley can relate too many of the children that watched the movie. It really showed Riley's stage of depression quite well. I think the directors did a great job over all with this movie. This is the first Disney movie that focuses closely on our cognitive behavior. The directors did a good job personifying emotions everyone can relate too. Like most Disney movies they made you feel emotions. I think they purposefully made you feel the emotions that you were watching. This movie was suitable for children or adults to watch. It was intelligent enough to keep adults entertained. As for the kids it was just as cute, funny, and imaginative as all the other Pixar movies. The picture and scenes were absolutely beautiful as well. Colors definitely popped and seemed to change with Riley's mood. The thing that I did not like about this movie is how the emotions were thought to have control over Riley. When Riley went into depression it was because of accidents that happened in headquarters. Depression is natural and happens to many people. Emotions do not have control over that. I think it is more Riley's environment that has an effect on her emotions and it did not seem to show that. I think the movie would be much better if her environment had affected her emotions more and the emotions understood what was happening. Overall I would give this movie a four out of five stars. Inside out was able to keep me entertained throughout the whole movie. It had an ingenious plot and creative characters. If you have not seen this movie yet I definitely recommend watching it. Inside out is the perfect movie for family and friends and it is a movie any person on Earth can relate to. Seems to be that the Disney Pixar combination is working out quite well. If they keep producing movies of this caliber they will continue to be prosperous."

","I was very excited to finally watch this movie as i am definitely a Disney and Pixar addict but i'm sad to report that i was actually disappointed. Perhaps it was my high expectations and the praise that a lot of my friends had bestowed upon it but i just wasn't blown away by it. For me it didn't even come close to most of the other Pixar movies i have seen, most of which received a ten out of ten rating from me. My biggest problem was that i just didn't laugh very much and i usually find Pixar movies hilarious, I also didn't fall in love with any of the characters and i usually always come away with a favourite but on this occasion i did not. I was entertained though and i do appreciate that the film was clever, it also looked fantastic and it did at points either make me cry or it managed to warm my heart. I just expected more and for me personally, i felt that it didn't fully deliver but i can see why other people love it."

","It is a good movie, there is no discussion about that! Pixar animation work is just amazing as always... The first scene with the baby Riley was ""WOW""! I could feel the texture of the skin... I can't describe it any better... Many viewers didn't like the movie, 'cause it was too dark or sad for kids. Guys, Disney do that since always! Fireworks and colors for the kids and a portrait of the reality with criticism, noted by some more observant adult viewers. Mickey F*ckin' Mouse is an adult single man that have a relationship with an adult single woman... They are not married... AND IT WAS THE F*CKIN' 1930's! Walt Disney laughed at the moralism of his time! The characters... Well... I already said that I didn't like any of Riley's emotion... Maybe that was the idea... I think that Joy was not supposed to be the good guy... But it is pretty weird a figure so visually likable being a b*tch... She stole Disgust's spotlight! Disgust, Fear and Anger... I wanna a spin off with those three ONLY! You can call it Inside Out: Puberty! For me they were character much more interesting than Joy and Sadness... One of the most accurate swings of the movie, the moments that don't matter who you are or where you're from, the moments you will enjoy the most... When they show other minds... His parents, the boy in the hockey match (I'm still laughing about it)... The credits scene was all about it, so I'm not the only one who really liked it!<br/><br/>At the end of the day... I'm sure that Inside Out is the great favorite for best animation at the Oscar's... Mininos and Hotel Transilvania 2 don't stand a chance... I think that it will be between Inside Out and Peanuts.<br/><br/>Summing up... Great animation work, a very good idea and plot, not so great characters, but very nice moments... It is a must watch!"
"alltherightreasons","8","3","25","29 July 2015"," Pixar's Miss Congenial
","Bleary-Eyed in the morning, putting on a jumper inside out, you might remark it as feeling different and a little uncomfortable. Flash forward to your exit out of the local cinema, and you would most likely think, ""hmm...Inside Out"", different certainly , yet wonderful in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>After a 2014 hiatus, Pixar have returned to the Shark-Tank of Animated Cinema with the beautifully poised ""Inside Out"". Directed by Pete Docter, the film chronicles the cerebral happenings within an eleven year old sweetheart, Riley, but not as you would have anticipated. As the film tape rolls, we are introduced to Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust, whom all are minion-like personified emotions.<br/><br/>Subtleties from past Pixar films are pulled out of the hat, although each one feels fresh and authentic for the viewer. Abstract ideas are explored vividly, akin to ""Up"" (Floating House/Personified emotions). Paradoxically, they seem to have expanded starting points for rather normal, to be expected scenarios, i.e An old man wanting to retire in Paradise and a child feeling uncomfortable in new surroundings. Also interesting is the dual narrative scampering along, first incorporated in ""Finding Nemo"". Funnily enough, the interacting emotions of ""Inside Out"" reminded me of the frenetic, yet somewhat Paranoid Fish Tank Residents, at 42 Wallaby Way Sydney!<br/><br/>One has to remember too that Riley is cast as a protagonist. She's not an old man trying to ease into retirement, a shy robot abandoning Earth, or a hotshot race-car trying to win the Piston Cup. Instead, similar to Brave, Pixar have clearly pitched a protagonist as the archetype of whom they'd like to see enjoy the film; an eleven year old. From here, we are really treated to beautiful iconography including the Core-Island like relics of Riley's, surrounded by a metaphorical ocean of thought. I admire how the creators gently nudged us in this direction with the slapstick short ""Lava"" to get us thinking about islands, relationships, perspectives etc, which was a nice touch(Although now I can't forget the song about Volcanoes in love, but that's beside the point!). I<br/><br/>A heart-warming message of compromise and perseverance pervades what is an entertaining, inspiring story. Laugh-Out-Loud hilarity ensues, most prominently thanks to Joy(Amy Poehler) and Sadness(Phyllis Smith). For Children, the characters are cutesy, funny and lovable and for a more mature audience(I'm looking at you, Parents!)the emotion caricatures typify a thread of relatability, a crack of vulnerability that brought a tear to the eyes of some at the screening I attended.<br/><br/>If at all there were to be a caveat, I would say that perhaps there's too many clever ideas fighting for our attention. Bludgeoning us with abstract idea after abstract idea is like listening to a compilation of Power Ballads. Yes, there's potent stuff coming through the earplugs, but ultimately it all becomes a bit overpowering and eventually tiresome. In short, this is something the editing team back in California should have looked into more. This is where ""Inside Out"" has just missed the Boat. Where Classics such as ""Up"" and ""toy Story"" develop a couple of brilliant concepts(Floating House/Lost Expedition/Unlikely Friendship/Escapism etc)""Inside Out"" reminds me of the Student at the Top of the Class that is just too perfect, too clever for their own good.<br/><br/>All that said, ""Inside Out"" has to be up there as one of Pixar's most mature, palpable and adventurous films to date. It echoes a slightly experimental charm about it too. It feels like the product of a crazy brainstorming session in a Pixar Boardroom, deliberated over by a bunch of sleep-deprived, self-confessed geniuses living off Caffeine and Sheer will-power alone; you've got to hand it to them, haven't you?.<br/><br/>Refined around the edges, ""Inside Out"" is essentially Pixar's Miss Congenial. It's a bit of everything that'll please and be adored by almost everyone, if a little too perfect at times."
"OlieRendch","8","3","25","29 July 2015"," Pixar films have been a bit 'meh' since Toy Story 3, but now they're back on top form with their latest instant classic.
","Inside Out is the story of an eleven-year-old girl called Riley who has just moved house but the majority of the film takes place in her mind and centers on her five main emotions. This idea itself is already a unique one and they do very clever things with it. It shows you how and why your brain does things, but in a really fun and entertaining way.<br/><br/>Although you have the bright colours and fantastical settings, it isn't always a kids film, there are quite a few jokes in there that I think everyone will laugh at, of course you get ones especially for children but it doesn't rely on them which is what is so good about Pixar. They also always have a deeper meaning in their films, a moral that stays with you, and this is no exception. Like some of their other films, this one also pulls on the heart strings at times and gives you some good emotional drama. I won't spoil the story as a lot of it was a surprise but it was an entertaining adventure inside Riley's head and a realistic depiction of life in the real world so as a whole, interesting all-round.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, I wasn't familiar with the majority of the cast but they did great in their roles, two highlights being Anger and Sadness, and of course the minor appearance of Disney's own John Ratzenberger.<br/><br/>In the end I'm glad Pixar is back to producing high quality films (although I wasn't that impressed with the short film at the beginning to this one) and look forward to The Good Dinosaur."
"vohnrocks","9","3","25","25 June 2015"," Pixar film is a complex and funny ride!
","Joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear: These are emotions we all experience as human beings. And once again, Pixar has chosen something that is relatively mundane, and turn them into a touching story involving colorful, adorable, and complex characters. Inside out is quintessential Pixar material: technically impressive and most importantly, human. The story is about different human emotions, personified through tangible characters, EXISTING inside a little girl's mind. Every memory that Haley experiences is stored in a ball, and the most important memories are called core memories, which are stored in a special section of Haley's brain. At first, the movie focuses on Joy's ability to bring Haley out of sad situations, such as her move away from her friends. On the other hand, Sadness always seems to bring Haley down by making her world a bit more DEPRESSING. From the get go, the audience can see a stark contrast between Joy and Sadness: As one seems to be in control and making Haley's life manageable, the other takes the back seat and occasionally chimes in to make Haley's life a little bit more depressing. After an accident, Joy and Sadness are trapped in Long term Memory, With Joy being gone, Haley's emotions become much more unpredictable. At the same time, Sadness's role becomes increasingly important as the story progresses, Sadness was able to calm Haley's Imaginary friend down and in addition, brought Haley's parents to comfort her, turning her sad memory into a joyful one. I think through the use of Joy and Sadness, Pixar wants to embrace the sadness that most of us have experienced in our lives. Many joyful moments are a result of the sadness that precedes them. For example, Haley was sad because she lost her game, her family didn't want her to be alone so they came and supported her. I think the idea of emotions as being complex, not black and white, is such an cool idea. It makes us appreciate the times that we are lonely and depressed. Being a psychology student, I also picked up a lot of psychology references in the movie. For example, balls of memories getting sucked into long term memory is not far off from the real PROCESS where daily memories are converted into long term memory during sleep. In addition, the portrayal of the subconscious as the place that stores all of our deepest fears are quite Freudian, the island of personality that is driven by core memories is similar to the psychological idea that our personalities are made up important interactions with our environments. One moment that I thought was very intriguing was when Haley lost all emotions and became numb. Her face was blank, she no longer cared about what was happening around her. To me, this moment showed that some individuals have gone through so much hardship that their emotions, which often function to as a device to warn them against danger, help them survive and fit into society, have been broken. It's almost as if their internal compasses are broken and they are unable to tell what's good and what's not good for them. Fortunately, Haley was able to regain her emotions and in the final moments, her memory balls are a mixture of emotions: Sadness and joy, anger and disgust, now interconnected, and her personality became more complex. The world of emotions is neither is black or white, but rather a mixture, diverse blend. GO PIXAR!!"

","I saw this movie today with my 4.5 y/o daughter and 3 y/o son. Daughter was very excited to see the movie and I thought it looked cute in the trailer. The movie started out hopeful but then it got really depressing and dark. I was actually upset watching this movie - that's not something that I can say has ever happened. It never really turned into the ""happy ending"" for me. It was depressing, then there was a sad moment (I shed some tears) then somewhat upbeat. My two really only understood the emotions when someone was crying so, to them, this movie was great. For me, it sucked!<br/><br/>Also, the animated short that played before the movie ""Lava"" was also very depressing."
"hassallmidge","9","3","26","8 August 2015"," From a twenty year old, this is an amazing film, an absolute must see!!
","So the film is set in the extremely colorful and fantastical world of Riley's mind, where 5 emotions (Joe, Fear, Anger, Sadness and Disgust) control and guide Riley through her life. The premise is simple and has a clear set of rules which makes it perfect for children and adults. The film aims to explore the complex idea's of memory, personality (to name just a few)and the affect they have on Riley's life and wow they do this beautifully with vibrant and colourful characters that are extremely well developed while staying simple, playful and entertaining.Throughout the film we are treated to simple but enjoyable humor that had me in stitches.<br/><br/>Writing this a a 20 year old man i should be the worst type of audience to connecting and enjoy this film (cough, frozen) as i should be too old to connect with Riley and too young to connect with the parents but thank everything i was wrong, it is fantastic a must see, and if anyone feels the need to compare it to frozen, they're doing this film an injustice.<br/><br/>Beautifully written, fantastical world, and a story and meaning behind it that rivals the animated films of old.

","The featured review on this page states that this movie requires a trigger warning. A Pixar movie is so emotionally impacting, that it is stirring up and genuinely pushing people over the edge with emotions. I don't think people realize and appreciate how hard this is to achieve through CGI, so kudos to Pixar for taking the torch into unexplored depths of the cinematic world.<br/><br/>I went into the movie depressed, and came out more depressed. Digging deeper and deeper into the opening 30 minutes of the movie brought me to tears when I looked back at all my memories and how they've crumbled and been shut out over the years, just like what happens to our vulnerable Riley throughout the film. Does that automatically entail a bad review, having a movie stir me up emotionally and breaching facets deeper than I ever could've by myself? Not at all. To see such a low rating over something is essentially ignorance.<br/><br/>What I saw from start to end was a classic Pixar movie unfold, with plenty of beautiful themes to latch onto and make you forget about the harsh ride up to the climax of the movie, and that's all it is, like everything else in life... a ride. Just be ready to feel the need to get off early if you're more sensitive to the content presented, because this is not something we've come to expect from Pixar, but at the same time, it's everything we've evolved and grown to encounter from them eventually.<br/><br/>See it with someone you trust, in case you are overly sensitive. There is no reason to dismiss a beautifully executed film if you can't internally handle it... just know what you're getting into ahead of time, don't expect a happy-go-lucky experience unless you're seeing it drunk or with an ignorant state of mind. The previews were really clear with the direction the movie was taking."

","Just saw the newly released Disney/Pixar animated feature film ""Inside Out"". The critical consensus is spot on. This is an excellent film. I loved it! One of Disney/Pixar's best animated films of their 20 year history. It's a return to top form for Disney/Pixar. <br/><br/>""Inside Out"" has that rare combination of qualities for an animated feature film: intelligence, maturity, thoughtful, insightful, perceptive, honest writing, along with richly detailed, imagined animation and characters. And yes, it's also entertaining.<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" gets it right, accurately bringing to life the emotions of the mind, in this case, the emotions of an 11 year old girl. Besides being intelligent and entertaining, there are some moments of surprising emotional depth and power, most of them occurring in the second half. This kind of emotional power rarely is achieved in an animated feature film. Disney/Pixar can be rightly proud of what they achieved with ""Inside Out"". The perception of parenting is also accurately done (true to life) in this film.<br/><br/>The last time I experienced this kind of emotional power and depth in an animated film was with ""Up"" from 2009, also produced by Disney/Pixar. The audience I saw""Inside Out"" with applauded at the end of the film. This was a family based audience on a Saturday matinÃ©e. For an ordinary entertainment driven audience to applaud, speaks of what Disney/Pixar has achieved with ""Inside Out"". <br/><br/>I found myself actually trying to contain my emotions, as I found myself choked up with emotion during a number of occasions, especially with some of the scenes of the second half of the film. Adults will certainly appreciate and children will enjoy this intelligent, meaningful, richly imagined, entertaining new film from Disney/Pixar. The most important takeaway for children with ""Inside Out"" is: all emotions have their place and even sadness can be a surprisingly useful and beneficial emotion."

I do agree that the tension in some scenes feels undermined by how characters need to survive (though first time we saw this, we weren't sure), and how the animation design seems bizarre in some scenes (namely the abstraction stages and closeups of the emotions). Overall, though, it excels as the second original idea for Pixar in 4 years (Brave quickly lost popularity but has the potential to grow a cult), with crystal clear animation quality and movement, a neat execution, relatable or likable characters, and triggers for each emotion. These are my 5:<br/><br/>Fear: That this movie is as overrated as people say and that a lot of the sins (see Everything Wrong With Inside Out) would be important<br/><br/>Anger: Some questionable decisions by Joy, such as manslaughter by the logic of Riley's brain in one scene <br/><br/>Disgust: A scene where Riley is nude and some times when the animation wasn't strong <br/><br/>Sadness: The scene when Riley arrives home and breaks down following a brain reboot <br/><br/>Joy: PLENTY of the jokes and the epilogue <br/><br/>Pixar has, in fact, redeemed themselves with this movie (too bad they would lose it again with The Good Dinosaur)."

","Computer-animated family film from Pixar Animation Studios and released by Disney, about the emotional scramble going on inside the brain of a normal, healthy little girl, is extraordinarily bright and colorful--and yet hyperactive, with overlapping dialogue that rushes by at such a fast clip one might think the sound designers and everyone else involved with the film were feeling the effects of a sugar rush. There's not much to the narrative (trouble-causing Sadness and ringleader Joy have to find their way out of the kid's long-term memory storage), while most of the attention is focused on the child's five basic emotions (the girl, Riley, and her parents rarely come to the fore as actual characters). Kids seem to enjoy the film because it's fluorescent and energetic, like a cereal commercial on television. With so much slapstick and shouting, it could easily compete with a restless child's attention span--and win. ** from ****"

","Inside Out is a lovely animation movie, fitting for all families. The title suits the movie very well. <br/><br/>Indeed, the story is about a little girl called Riley and the emotions that make her personality. These emotions face challenges throughout the story line as Riley grows up and reaches her teenage years, especially when she has to move to San Francisco because of her dad's work. As Riley battles with real life, her emotions go through a journey of adventure inside her subconscious mind after a disagreement between Joy and Sadness.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie very much. It gives us an insight on how we are all driven by our emotions and that having mixed emotions on any matter is completely fine. I guess you could say that's what makes us human! I had my doubts about it being a tad childish, but it appeals to viewers of all ages.<br/><br/>The voice actors were particularly well chosen, as each one fits his or her character very well. The technicians in charge of the animated aspect of the movie have done a great job of making the emotions come to life and make the viewers personally relate to them. <br/><br/>It doesn't come as a shock that Disney-Pixar has once again pulled off a great plot and an overall successful movie suited for every family night for everyone from child to adult.<br/><br/>I would recommend you to go and see it with your loved ones"

","Riley is an 11 year-old girl. We see her growing up and how her inner thoughts and emotions develop and control her, especially her memories. These thoughts and emotions are represented by miniature versions of her, and live in their own little world, controlling Riley from behind a console. Everything is going well and Riley seems to be leading a blissful, uncomplicated existence. Then she and her parents move home, from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the bottom falls out of Riley's world.<br/><br/>Sweet movie on growing up, making memories and dealing with change. Funny, fun, emotional and reasonably clever. Had the potential to be incredibly profound and intelligent but pulls its punches in that regard. While it does touch on some interesting aspects of the human psyche, it doesn't really explore the subject deeply. Instead we have silly chase scenes and the like.<br/><br/>I guess the problem is that the movie's main target audience is children and an illuminating, deep exploration of human thinking and emotions would be too complex for them.<br/><br/>Overall: enjoyable, with some good intellectual and emotional moments, but uneven, as these moments are interspersed with bland, even silly, adventure-type scenes and plot-lines."

","Inside Out is an outstandingly original, heartfelt story from Pixar about growing up and learning to handle your biggest emotions. Told primarily from the perspective of the feelings inside 11-year-old Riley's mind the plot has many moments including bridges/islands crumbling, a train tumbling over a precipice, and characters falling into a deep, dark pit. Some of Riley's fears are also on display, including a giant, scary clown. Parents are likely to get hit hardest by the film's heart-tugging moments, but anyone with empathy will feel for Riley as she experiences life's ups and downs. Ultimately, Inside Out has important messages about needing to feel and express all of your emotions, whether happy or sad. Although most of the content is appropriate for elementary schoolers and up, younger kids may need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are references to abstract thought and the subconscious, and it can be a little confusing when other characters emotions are shown."

","Just based on the movie, it deserves a rating of a 4 or 5 but I'm giving it 6 stars because of its intellectual aspect.<br/><br/>I was so excited to see this film. I missed it in theaters and didn't get to see it in 3D so I'm not sure what that would add to the movie. I am a Pixar lover but this one was a major disappointment. On some levels, the movie is amazing and the writers obviously did a lot of research and carefully laid out their story - so much to the movie is brilliant. How what is happening inside of Riley's (the main character) brain and how it affects what she is doing ""outside"" is seamless. The sections of the brain like memory and imagination are wonderful. The whole aspect of how suppressing emotions affects us is great. However, while the representation of the inner workings of the brain in a fun way that is accessible to children was exceptional, it didn't translate into an interesting story. (By accessible to children, I mean even if they didn't understand it, they wouldn't be confused by it either.) The story is just OK, a bit boring actually. The goal of the movie wasn't to be a laugh-fest but I also didn't get the emotional connection needed to sustain it either. Also, the cast was great.<br/><br/>I still give a major kudos to Pixar for attempting such a layered film with so much potential. Intellectually, I appreciated the effort of trying to give us a children's movie with so much depth. Unfortunately, the end result was mediocre."

","When I first got word about Pixar making a movie about emotions, I was amazed. As a big fan of Pixar' s work, I knew good stuff was coming. I wasn't expecting something this bad. Although the characters are compelling, and I did understand the fact that Riley's father suffered rage attacks and her mother suffered depression. I did understand the struggle of Riley and her emotions. But the script! Awful, every scene was the same as the one before and after. The personality islands shut down, they fall, and joy and sadness try to go back to the tower to save the day. Is there any fun in that? Because being honest here, kids movies are made to have fun. So yeah, those are my thoughts on Inside Out. Hope Pixar shoots higher and unlocks their true potential on ""A Good Dinosaur""."

I am not going to say a lot more about this movie because I think that the fact that I didn't know a lot about the movie made me appreciate the originality of this movie and the ideas that it shows even more.

Finally, don't think this movie is only for kids like a lot of Pixar movies there are tons of jokes for adults, I also think it will make any adults think about their childhood and all the things we let go in order to become an adult and the moral of the movie is a strong one that challenges some of the conceptions that we have in our society today about our emotions.<br/><br/>The only downside I have about this movie doesn't even comes from me but from my friends who saw the movie with me and loved it too but he thoughts that it could have benefit from more exciting action scenes.

There wasn't a focal point because everything was watered down. Things seemed to be done arbitrarily.

","Inside out was written by someone(s) with personal experience and understanding of the fragility of human consciousness. <br/><br/>The human mind consists of 5 sentient emotions who operate a mainframe in each living beings' brain. Joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust.<br/><br/>If you've ever suffered depression, you will understand that joy and sadness are essential partners. Without them, you break down. If you completely lose the ability to feel either joy or sadness, you shut down and your life easily spirals out of control. Losing both of these emotions leads to numbness. Numbness is scary, because without both joy and sadness, you have no desire. Desire is the number one force driving an emotional being to continue with life.<br/><br/>If I say anything else I have to tick the spoiler box.<br/><br/>Previous reviews have stated that Inside Out is disappointing.

The only flaw was that it did drag just a bit towards the middle of the film but that's just my opinion. Overall, I think this is a film that adults might actually enjoy even more than children.

I would have liked to have seen more from Anger, Fear and Disgust, the main characters are certainly Joy and Sadness, but the scenes in the headquarters between those three characters are some of my favourites and I would have loved to have seen more of it, also I think Bing Bong, who is easily my favourite character in this film, could have been developed more. The voice cast is absolutely outstanding, perfectly conveying the emotions of their characters, Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith are both perfectly casted, as are the other emotions, and Kaitlyn Dias also delivers the voice of Riley, an eleven year old girl, very well, Pixar never mess up with voice acting.

","We meet Riley when she is born. We also meet Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger, personifications of her emotions who live inside her head and contribute towards her memories – colour-coded globes which build into a library and a series of interconnected city-like structures which embody the key aspects of Riley's emotional growth. Her life is mostly happy until the family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and everything familiar which she loved is gone. The loss of what she loved leads to a crisis in Headquarters which leaves Joy, the sole positive emotion, fighting a losing battle to protect the fragile structures built up over Riley's 11 years.<br/><br/>This film is cleverly conceived and executed, carrying what is effectively two parallel and interlinked stories: Riley's struggle to cope with her drastically changed circumstances, and Joy's struggle to protect Riley's emotional history. The visual representation of this struggle is reminiscent of the sequences in Vanellope's race world in Wreck-It Ralph in terms of psychedelically coloured surrealism, but this is both imaginative and calculated to appeal to younger audience members. The Riley story will appeal to their parents.<br/><br/>In truth, this is a very ambitious film in terms of putting together an exciting, eye-catching action adventure which works on a fairly superficial level for the less sophisticated viewer, and some fairly high-concept stuff for the older viewer. It largely succeeds, and its conclusion – life is made up of both positive and negative, and we need both to be a fully realised individual – is gracefully presented.<br/><br/>Another winner from Pixar, and confirmation that Pete Docter is a genius."
"Cjalln1","8","2","21","5 August 2015"," A surprisingly clever children's film aimed more at adults than kids
","A foundation on fairly deep themes (reactions caused by different emotions, the difficult of moving across the country, growing up) and plenty of more grown-up jokes make ""Inside Out"" a successful film in its own right. Bizarrely, where it falls down is its accessibility to children. Riley's age (11) and the everyday situations she experiences should make her story relatable, yet the introspective focus on her emotions' decision-making turns the film into a more profound reflection on human nature. Pixar have developed a reputation as a thoughtful alternative to Disney animation; debatably this is the first occasion of their parent-friendly children's films which will be more favoured by adults than youngsters. Don't get me wrong - ""Inside Out"" is a very well-thought-out, cleverly crafted and enjoyable film, it's just that it may go over the heads of the majority of the target audience.<br/><br/>The animation is average by animated-film standards, with bright colours and glows to amuse kids but enough darkness in parts to accurately reflect parts of the human mind. The music is of a similar standard, effective and subtle whilst not being outstanding. What really makes ""Inside Out"" an excellent film is its themes and messages. Many kids' films previously - notably Pixar works - have tried to identify with children's minds and thought processes, so it's no surprise that the most effective one I've seen is set entirely within preteen Riley's mind. The notion that sadness and other seemingly unhelpful feelings are actual useful is an important sentiment to get across to children, and this film accomplishes effectively while avoiding being ""preachy"" or cliché. The short foray into her parents' emotions is one of the more inspired ""adult- targeted"" jokes, revealing the subtle emotional differences between genders, and between adults and children.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was extremely enjoyable and deserves multiple watches; there were enough jokes to lighten the heavy subject matter and the sparkling voice acting from all of Riley's personified emotions brightened up the script too. ""Inside Out""'s slightly ambivalent tone should make for interesting differences between adult and child opinions of the film."
"dyllon_jeng","7","2","21","25 July 2015"," Hilarious, inventive, and imaginative
","With all the classics that Pixar has produced, it's created a standard for itself that seems to rise with almost every film it creates. Before watching Inside Out, I was thinking that perhaps Pixar would have difficulty truly meeting that standard. Fortunately, I was wrong.<br/><br/>After watching the trailer, I honestly wasn't too excited about seeing Inside Out. I thought the concept of the five miniature characters controlling the mind of the human was interesting, but it didn't strike me as particularly creative or clever. But the movie ingeniously expands on this idea and offers the audience a truly imaginative vision of how so many other aspects of the human mind work. Along with this vision came brilliant, unimaginable images of inside the human mind that were perfectly illustrated by Pixar's superior animation. <br/><br/>Regarding the humor, I think this movie is one of Pixar's funniest movies. I have never truly laughed when watching other Pixar films like I did while watching Inside Out. The movie offered a great variety of humor, providing plenty of physical comedy, occasional visual comedy, and a lot of clever jokes from the dialogue. <br/><br/>I'd say the only minor flaw of this movie would be its characters. Evidently, the main characters are the ones that are inside Riley's (the human's) mind, trying to control her. While they are interestingly portrayed, they're all one dimensional characters (since they control a specific emotion for Riley). With this in mind, they are not truly compelling characters that force the viewer to truly care for them. In addition, since much of the plot focuses on what is occurring inside Riley's mind, it's hard for the viewer to develop a connection with Riley, too. <br/><br/>To sum it up, I'll say that Inside Out, while it is a great movie, isn't Pixar's best, but that's not really saying much. It was fun to watch, extremely clever, and a bit moving at times. Definitely worth watching."
"morrily","8","2","21","22 July 2015"," Great movie, but not exceptional
","I went into Inside Out with pretty high hopes. I had heard from podcast people and critics that this movie was absolutely fantastic and I agree. I think it was a good movie, creative, great to look at, and had funny and sad moments. I just didn't connect with it as much as I wanted to. I think that could have something to do with that fact that I'm 19, so I don't really have that parental experience that I think grown ups connected with and I'm too old to relate to the emotions that I went though as a kid. I think one of the reasons why I felt a little disappointed is because I expect these epic or beautiful adventures from Pixar now. I don't really think this adventure was very epic. I never felt the sense that if they died or if they didn't succeed in their task, the world would end. Although I agree emotions are powerful, I didn't really think Riley's running away was drastic. It was also so predictable that I think that ruined any kind of suspense that the movie could have had. I also felt like the emotions besides Joy, Sadness, and the imaginary friend weren't fleshed out enough. They all seemed like comic reliefs and if they weren't in the story, it wouldn't have changed the plot. I know I sound like I'm attacking this movie but I did like it! I thought it was a beautiful movie and certainly had moving parts. I liked the characters and the message, but it just didn't personally stick with me compared to Wall-e, Up, or Toy Story which are the kinds of powerful movies I expect from Pixar now. I feel like this is a movie that could be particularly good for parents and kids because those are the two age groups that have a strong connection to the characters. Maybe in a few years I'll find this more moving, but at my stage in life I wasn't as satisfied with it as I wanted to be."
"moviewizguy","8","2","21","25 June 2015"," Let Your Emotions Run
","INSIDE OUT is the best film by Pixar since TOY STORY 3. However, the film never really reaches the amazing quality Pixar is known for. It's perfectly good though, and there are moments of Pixar brilliance: The beginning and ending are especially fantastic. The setup of the world inside Riley's mind is wonderful, original, and clever, while the ending is appropriately emotional, delivering a surprising payoff that will make anyone cry. Well, anyone with emotion.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the middle is where it drags. The problem is the second act of the film is very repetitive and predictable, with little differentiation between scenes that could sustain interest. Once you see the tracks being laid out, you can tell where everything is heading, which isn't a huge problem, but it definitely made me impatient during certain moments in the film. I know I'm in the minority when I say this, but I'm also not a huge fan of imaginary character (Bing Bong, oh god). I found his character to be very grating, who felt more like a plot device than an actual, fully-realized character.<br/><br/>Despite all that, and this is where I let my walls down, the whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. INSIDE OUT is an important film, where the filmmakers found a ingenious way to explain what goes on inside a person's head, how emotions work, and how people deal with those emotions. By the end of it, their observations can be so utterly profound that one can easily forget the flaws that plague the second act. Who knew a story about an 11-year-old girl's emotions can be so moving and universal at the same time? While INSIDE OUT isn't up there with Pixar's masterpieces, it's a step towards the right direction.<br/><br/>P.S. What was up with Lava? Definitely the worst Pixar short I've seen."

Blame it, rather, on the tiny voices quarreling constantly from one end of their brains to the other. Advice, rules, cautions, responsibilities, social norms, parental expectations, American Values, homework, politeness, best behaviors, decency, kindness, daily chores, proper decorum, and common sense can all be thrown to the winds whirling inside each child's noggin. Their very self-hood is shown to be based upon a relatively small handful of memories subject to gross distortion at the drop of a hat. INSIDE OUT personifies the Aging Process as a callously cackling cleaning crew clearing cherished memories off the Cliff of Self Awareness into the Chasm of Forgetfulness. Disney pictures a Child's Mind as a miniature Disneyland, complete with ""Imagination Island,"" ""Goofball Island,"" and so on. The Mouse House's clear implication is that if you don't refresh your kids' minds at Disneyland regularly, they're liable to take a bus to Duluth--or worse!

"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","2","21","23 June 2015"," Dives into a deep bittersweet nostalgia that's impossible to resist.
","Everyone agrees Pixar have been in a slump since Toy Story 3, their best work in their 20 years of releasing feature films. The Cars sequel was the most prominent evidence that they're a business that wants money. While the first is enjoyable for what it is, I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes of number 2. Brave was a complete misfire, structurally incompetent, painfully unfunny and I haven't been able to watch anything Scottish since. Their Oscar leaves a sour taste on the category. However, I am a staunch defender of Monsters University, a film that may follow pleasant kid formula for the first breezy two thirds but develops into a heartfelt lesson of perseverance in its final act. I can't argue that it wasn't a necessary film. Now they're on the rebound, a take 2 on an original property with a female focus and at least we can say that the Pixar the public and critics love whole- heartedly is back. <br/><br/>I'll admit, I did criticise Inside Out at first. The designs and concept felt more like branding fit for Happy Meal toys than developable characters. I sold the studio short though, as further successful marketing promised more insightful and funnier observations. They have a noble quest for this generation in giving them a visual perspective on not only how they feel, but how others feel. It fits firmly in the Pixar family. Inside Out marries the vast adventure of Finding Nemo, the character frictions of Toy Story, the lovable bureaucracy of Monsters Inc. and the wistful emotion of Up. You can start to feel Pete Docter's directorial stamp and his personal touch feeds into a film that could have felt far too committee lead. Here they go back to their roots as it's their most cartoony movie yet with characters more Elastic than Elasti-Girl. You can feel all the animators having fun with some scenes such as the maybe-too-clever Abstract Thought sequence.<br/><br/>Of course, the story does suffer from it's manufactured trappings. When you set all the rules, the story never feels completely organic as the writers invent all the resources to solve the character's problems. They use the Pixar beat sheet favourite of coincidences getting the characters into trouble too liberally here that you can predict when things will fall apart and like Finding Nemo, it can feel too episodic. Instead, you can call it a testament to how they can reign in their unbridled creativity. Those bumps in the road are easy to overlook when you have splendid visuals, brilliant sense of humour and a wonderful lead like Joy, a Tinkerbell-esque pixie sans the mean streak that makes you want to conjure her in your own mind right now. Amy Poehler is perfect casting, reprising the endearing optimism of Parks and Recreation's Leslie Knope for the big screen. Pixar once chose movie stars, now they're keen on how many eyes are back on TV, recruiting The Office favourites Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling for other emotions along with Bill Hader and Lewis Black.<br/><br/>They're wise to not make them as one dimensional as their names suggest. Joy's main concern is Riley's happiness and collecting as many yellow memories as possible, but in order to do that it takes a selfish sense of control to the disregard of other emotions, such as frequent party pooper Sadness. Her arc is the most compelling and dimensional, while the other negative emotions supply her journey or provide very humorous gag material. However, Inside Out will always be notable for giving Richard Kind his due. He's played very small bit parts in many of their prior features but here he finally has a role to win over our hearts as the imaginary friend Bing Bong. The film hits its emotional crescendo in its crisis point thanks to Bing Bong and Joy's crucial revelation. At its best, the film is very powerful, tapping into a tender deep-rooted nostalgia for innocence lost. As a result, the inevitable resolution feels greedy, wringing tears out of us because it can, leaving out the music so you can hear other sniffling audience members. At least it's not a forced moment, but the film already hit its peak by then. <br/><br/>That doesn't take away what it does in the meantime, embracing the complexities of emotions and where they can lead if they're allowed to be balanced. It does have a similar issue to Toy Story 2 where it peters out near the end, falling short of a few promises, not going the extra mile like Monsters University did to our pleasant surprise. It's almost too light. But despite its flaws and necessary contrivances to make it work, this is clearly a film that kids today will carry with them until adulthood, peeling back its identifiable layers as they get older, and that generational importance is easy to appreciate. Hopefully more important to them than Frozen. While it may not be as good as their 1995-2004 output (save A Bug's Life, though that's not bottom tier), I prefer it to their acclaimed 2007-2009 trio. Let this be the beginning of a new hot streak. <br/><br/>7/10"

","Do you ever look at someone and wonder, ""What is going on inside your head?"" Well Inside Out pulls back the curtain and shows you not just what you're think but how you're thinking.<br/><br/>Riley is a pretty happy 11-year old girl, she's got great friends, a wonderful family and tons of things she loves to do. That is, until she is uprooted from her Midwestern home in Montana and has to move to San Francisco. Her emotions – Joy, Disgust, Sadness, Anger and Fear – try to help her adjust to this turbulent time while keeping her happy.<br/><br/>Pixar story-makers manage to cram every aspect of the adolescence experience during a tumultuous time into a fun adventurous film. The minds behind Inside Out thought of everything in how our memories and experiences can form our personalities and being. Seriously, they delve into our dreams, imagination, sub-conscious, even long term memories in a fully conceptualized and engaging experience that seamlessly fits into the exploits of the narrative.<br/><br/>Adults will empathize and appreciate the changing course that Riley goes through and how the emotions shape who she is through its resolution. While children will love the vibrantly full characters and creative escapades.<br/><br/>Inside Out has enough heart and emotion to live up to the daunting task of creating a film that reflects the full range of emotion. Conceptually, the film is magnificent and reminds us of the wonder of Toy Story, Wall-E and Monsters Inc. It is quite clear that Pete Docter invested a lot of time, energy and thought into this film, and it pays off.<br/><br/>Inside Out brings the magic and childhood innocence through an animated narrative back to Pixar, and it is nice to see a film dedicated to kids and encouraging them not to change or lose their innocence, and to never grow up.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."
"stevendbeard","7","2","21","19 June 2015"," Don't Grow Up
","I saw ""Inside Out"", starring the voices of Amy Poehler-Parks and Recreation_tv, Blades of Glory; Bill Hader-SNL_tv, Men in Black 3; Lewis Black-The Daily Show_tv, Hannah and Her Sisters and Kaitlyn Dias-The Shifting, Burial.<br/><br/>This is a Pixar animated movie that takes a look at the emotions of a teenaged girl-actually, I think she was 11 years old, if I remember correctly. It's directed by Pete Docter, the director of Up & Monsters, Inc. and he was also the writer of Up, Wall-E, Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story 1 & 2-Not too shabby for a resume'. He said that he got the idea for the movie from watching his own teenaged daughter and wondering what was going on in her mind. I don't know if that is true or not but I seem to remember an old TV show called Herman's Head that had a similar idea, although he was a business young adult instead of a young girl. Anyway, the premise of the movie is that we get to take a look inside the mind of Kaitlyn, an 11 year old girl. Some of her emotions consist of Amy as Joy, Bill as Fear and Lewis as Anger. I think there were a total of 5 emotions portrayed-sadness and disgust were the other 2-and the emotions use glass balls to hold Kaitlyn's memories and store them in a command center. The problems start when Kaitlyn's parents decide to move from Minnesota to San Francisco because of a job opportunity for dad. Kaitlyn takes it the hardest; new house, new school, new friends, etc. and things get a little complicated after an accident in emotion central. I liked how they would show the maintenance people in her mind whose job was to get rid of unused thoughts- if they haven't been used in a while, out they go. It has enough going on that should keep both adults and kids entertained. FYI:There is a scene as the credits start but the only thing at the very end is a little written piece of advice saying something like; Dedicated to Our Children. Don't Grow Up. Ever. It's rated ""PG"" for some action and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"ZacharyLovesPixar","8","2","21","19 June 2015"," Pixar, you really pushed my emotions
","I've always loved Pixar movies and I consider ""Up"" to be my favorite movie of ALL TIME. I had high hopes for ""Inside Out"", as I always do for Pixar films, and I don't know if it met them. ""Inside Out"" is a movie which I believe everyone can relate to in some sense or another. But it's not what I expect from a Pixar movie. I expect Pixar movies to have that deep moral and theme but also to be light on you and full with great jokes, but the moral and them of ""Inside Out"" felt too deep and the jokes were meager and not the jokes I expected. I tend to laugh at every little joke and I didn't laugh too much. Granted, there were times I did laugh way too hard but those were well deserved. However, the rest of the movie was very serious and did keep me on the edge of my seat. I've seen plenty of dramas about growing up that weren't this deep or depressing that were obviously made for an older crowd. If you want a light-hearted, fun Pixar adventure, this is not the one to see; I'd suggest ""The Good Dinosaur"" coming this fall. I honestly felt like this Pixar film was going after the wrong demographic because young kids would not understand the movie. I would recommend this movie for kids 12 and up because most likely your kid will not understand. Now this movie was excellently made and was a joy to watch; pun intended. However, you will need to be ready to cry because that is just what this film will do to you. I didn't walk out of the theater filling happy but more depressed and had a heavy feeling that it had made upon my thoughts. I honestly still feel like I didn't fully captivate the whole depth it had emotionally wise and I am planning on seeing another screening of it. That being said, it's not a complex story but I need to fully form my opinions about it. If your emotions to be pushed to their maximum, see this movie. This is a really well made movie that looks incredible with a well developed story. It deserves the Pixar badge it has attached to its name and won't let you down."

I imagine the people or (or lowlife with too much time and too many fake accounts) that try to shoot down this film, they probably have been seriously triggered in some way, on a deep emotional level. Do you think you should be happy 24/7? Do you think sadness has no value? Do you not believe in scientific concepts (the brain, emotion, memory, neuroscience) which are in abundance in the film? The type of person to hammer this film, I would not want my kids to be within 2 miles of that person, much less do I think that person should be trusted to have kids of their own. <br/><br/>

","It has amazing refreshing plot and new setting in animation world. It has overall great message, that happiness is great, who don't want happiness in your life? But sadness is important in your life too, if you doesn't feel your sadness, your feeling will be empty because it means you are no longer have that feeling that makes you feel human.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I get that message only at the end of the movie. I start to feel the character after The center of the plot get to our main girl feeling. For the rest of the movie, from first act to second one, I don't feel attached to any of the character despite I already know the messages they want to convey. I disagree if someone said this movie is not popular because it touch sensitive issues that children don't understand, It's the opposite, this movie is easy to understand and really made for children around 9 - 12 years old if your children are smart enough.<br/><br/>I's a good movies, just lack character attachment like Toy Story gave me."
"mrbarooee","9","2","22","26 January 2016"," Perfect marriage of idea and story
","It seems Pete Doctor never ceases to fascinate us with his brilliant new ideas. Sometimes it's an old guy who soars with his house on balloons. Or it's the exciting and at times grotesque ( especially in Toy story 2) world of toys and perhaps it's a garbage collecting robot left alone on Earth who ignites love in a terminator. In his Golden Globe( and most probably Oscar) winning movie he has chosen human's emotions as his characters. There are four: Joy, Sadness, Anger and Disgust. But the movie is not about emotions. The major theme of this animation is actually growing up. What has catapulted this movie out of this world is not its novel idea, but how the makers were able to harness this novelty and did not let it overshadow the story. I can assume the conversation happening inside Pete Doctor's head:<br/><br/><ul><li>Hey guys I found a great idea to make our new movie -Oh, yeah that's awesome but let's tell a good story too And oh boy haven't they succeeded at that? It's like they had this idea and put it away at the back of their head and lived with it for a long time then when the time was right they put it on the screen. After a brief introduction the new world, the gripping story starts, grabs your attention and never stops to the very end. A perfect marriage f idea and story. As you can expect, it is replete with symbols: Train of thoughts, imagination land, colors and what characters do( namely Bing Bong in his touching sacrifice). But again they almost never get in the way of the story. For example the idea that facts and opinions play each other's roles in a teenager's head, or the whole concept of déjà vu are mentioned so smoothly that we may not even notice them the first time we see the film. Explaining the symbols can simply take the romance away and one should discover and interpret them for themselves. Interestingly, it is not the kind of movie you want to talk about it with others. It is simply too personal. Like you want the whole thing to be your own. It actually assures you that everyone knows what it is about and they do not need your input and neither do you. We feel too close to Riley; we know her inside out after all.</li></ul>"
"nj-91486","8","2","22","27 December 2015"," Worth watching!
","The movie was and should be meant for children. It was commendable in screenplay and animation but in a scientific standpoint, the movie disappoints. In other words, it struggles to find any biological accuracy. It's no excuse for a Disney movie but overall it captures you for the whole length of the tittle.<br/><br/>The movie starts with appointing a basic entity of every primal emotion of a little girl as she's born and grows up to be a teenager. The concepts or sadness, anger, long term memory and depiction of a savior in the name or happiness. Basically, the point it to keep the Joy doing it's work and not letting Sadness with the right mix of every emotion to keep the her ethically sound the help her adapt to the new situations and leaving hardships of moving on from her childhood home to focus on the life per se."
"IsaacSage","8","2","22","9 December 2015"," 4.25/5
","Pixar's bread and butter has been making animated films for kids AND adults. Sure, other studios have followed sit, and nowadays most adults can get enjoyment out of most kids films. However, Pixar is something different. I can't really cover what exactly that is, but just look at the opening credits of Up. Just look at basically all of Finding Nemo. But they've been in a bit of a dry spell. The Cars films are basically commercials for a theme park, Brave tried something different but failed, and Monsters University...well to be honest I can't even remember Monsters University. But now Inside Out is here, which takes us inside the mind of a young girl named Riley, who has just left her friends behind to move to San Francisco with her parents. When she's there, she has difficulty making new friends, and her parents are dealing with some money troubles. We see things however, from the perspective of the four emotions that dominate the ""control center"" inside her head. Joy(Amy Poehler) Sadness(Phyllis Smith) Anger(Lewis Black) Disgust(Mindy Kaling) and Fear(Bill Hader.) Joy is a little compulsive about Riley's memories, and soon she and sadness are sucked out of headquarters and into the big bad wilderness of a little girl's mind. The first thing that hit me about this film was how damn creative it was. Imagination, dreams and nightmares, imaginary friends, and the train of thought are all handled with an amazing amount of brilliance that most films lack. The voice-acting is all great, definitely on the funny and light side at the beginning, but when the hard-hitting emotional beats of the film hit, they hit extremely hard. The film's message is perhaps the most refreshing thing about it. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's unlike anything any kids film has taught us before, and the film's finale is one of the most heartwarming moments I've seen this year. Inside Out isn't perfect however. It's just under two hours, and the middle does get quite repetitive. Kids will no doubt enjoy the color on display, but it does get a bit tiresome. That's about the only criticism I have, besides the fact that the film doesn't feel as Magical as Finding Nemo or Up. I'm not quite sure why that is, but with Pixar, when the whole movie jells it creates a truly special experience. However when it doesn't, it is at least noticeable. This last thing is not a criticism or praise but a question. How do kids react to this film? It's funny and colorful, but will many of the jokes be lost on them? This is the first pixar film that is equally for adults as it is kids. Honestly, as many adults can learn from this film as kids. It's directed by Pete Doctor, and while it's not quite the first 15 minutes of Up, it is pretty damn close."
"ElliotTheMighty","8","2","22","4 December 2015"," A truly original Pixar film.
","""Inside Out"", after my opinion, is a very strange Pixar story. While some people thinks this is a boring story, and some others thinks it's a very emotional and beautiful story. I like this movie because it's so original. If you're understanding the true meaning of how Riley is acting, because she has troubles in school and depressed by the new home, if you're understanding that part, you'll probably see the movie as a much darker story, with realities you can relate to in real life, rather than just a stupid silly adventure of 2 animated characters, who are lost in a fantasy world.<br/><br/>What amazed me most about ""Inside Out"" then, is how the story managed to contextualize so much of this messiness, defining Riley in her final hours by the internal conflict between her stubborn and selfless sides, and demonstrating how this constant inner strife made her so many different things – needy, brave, impulsive, brilliant, isolated. <br/><br/>It's not the very best Pixar movie I've seen, but it really delivers some originality that I haven't seen before. - Sorry for the bad English, I'm not very in to write reviews in English :)"

The characters are really entertaining and you always have a reaction to them especially the characters that represents 5 emotions (Joy,Sadness,Fear,Anger and Digust).The animation is also great.

"ctowyi","9","2","22","30 August 2015"," Pixar is Back!
","After Toy Story 3 (2010), Pixar's outputs seemed to have plateaued. Gone are the characters that stayed in your consciousness long after the movie has ended. Gone too are the original ideas that are amazingly simple but yet instantly relatable. In comes sequels/prequels that milked nostalgia like cheat codes. Sitting in a cinema yesterday, a big smile stayed on my face from start to end amidst some bouts of streaming hot tears. Pixar is so so back!<br/><br/>Inside our heads, there are five principal emotions, each personified here as Fear (Bill Hader), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black) and Joy (Amy Poehler). They live inside young girl Riley (Kaitlyn Dias). Joy, by running the controls and keeping everyone else under check, becomes the de facto boss. A happy Riley is a well-adjusted Riley, and her parents (Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) are pleased with her. But, an accident involving Riley's happy memories changes her entire outlook. Joy and Sadness need to find her memories and return them to the Headquarters before it is too late.<br/><br/>The centre of the story is sadness. It is an emotion that I have always believed the most important in giving breadth to all other emotions. In all the writing classes I teach, I always ask my kids to think about the last time they were happy and to feel its fleeting intensity. Then I get them to recall the last time they encountered failure, a betrayal, a belittling statement... The sheer intensity and torrent of feelings never seem to diminish no matter how old you are. Time does heal old wounds but it doesn't make you forget them. Inside Out exemplifies all my beliefs and that all great stories come from a moment of sadness. <br/><br/>Before anyone starts to conclude that this latest Pixar offering is a sad-fest, it is not. This is a piece of incredible filmmaking. The ideas and visuals are electrifying but yet rendered with much tenderness and poignancy. I am no psychologist but I do have a strong feeling that everything depicted on screen has been carefully researched and no cognitive tidbit is left unchewed. For example, I have read somewhere that it is during our sleep that short term memories becomes long term ones, and how the concept is illustrated here is so simple and stupendous. The mindscape illustrated here is also a lavish wonderland of possibilities. There is also the proverbial ""train of thought"" that only runs when Riley is conscious which is so ingenious. The continuous personifications of the abstract into the concrete really makes this a 101 guide to ""Understanding How The Brain Functions"". <br/><br/>The wordplay is fantastic and they come fast and furious. I am sure I missed some in the midst of hearty laughter but the problem will be addressed once I lay my hands on the blu- ray. What I didn't miss are the emotional moments which have so much unforced poignancy. Absolutely love the moment when Joy realizes her place in the scheme of all things and when Sadness finally understands and embraces her meaning in life. <br/><br/>Inside Out is not just a superb return to form for Pixar, IMHO it might just be the best Pixar film to date, and it is easily one of the best films I had the pleasure of seeing this year. The only minor quibble I have, and I do underscore the words ""minor"" and ""quibble"", is that children might not be able to grasp the the full extent of the ramifications of the story. But I guess that would mean much healthy conversations between the parents and their kids. That's never bad thing. Growing up is a scary thing and being sad is absolutely okay."
"davidgee","7","2","22","26 August 2015"," Brain fodder for kids
","Not the kind of film I usually go to see, but saddled (I mean ""blessed"") with my partner's children (5 and 7) on a rainy afternoon in Sussex, this seemed an easy option. (They call me 'Grandpa', by the way - out of respect for my age and the fact that I don't quite fit the Stepmom profile.) I think they were less dazzled by it than I was: no shoot- outs, no explosions, no witches and wizards.<br/><br/>Most of the voices were unfamiliar to me (including Riley's and all the Emoticons) although I recognised Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan as Mom and Dad, and Frank Oz in a bit-part. The voices hardly matter: what matter are the visuals and the storyline; both are cleverly conceived and cleverly executed. Maybe some of the areas inside our heads make for slightly indigestible brain-fodder for younger tots, but I was charmed and enchanted. Another superb offering from Pixar that addresses the kid inside all of us."

Check out Ringling College Animation Student Films Class of 2013. Watch ""Brain Divided"" It is a film by Joon Soo Song, Joon Shik Song, and Josiah Haworth. The idea of different emotions controlling the brain with a computer board. Of course with a Pixar budget you can expand the storyline and really go into detail. I am not making any accusations, watch for yourself and comment. I can't help but wonder, with as awesome as this movie is, where did Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen draw their inspiration?

As is the case with their other productions, there is fun for the children keeping them engaged the entire movie, but a theme throughout that is great for teens and adults. It is truly magical how they integrate real-world issues into a film without being tedious; I left the theater still thinking of some scenes and how they reflect in real-life. The animation is spectacular; the editing superb; the directing awesome and the story on the whole is truly wonderful. Of course the voices were right-on and all hit their mark for their characters. This is a must see movie for everyone in the family! Nobody will be disappointed with, ""Inside Out."""
"DareDevilKid","6","2","23","1 February 2016"," Good Concept, Underwhelming Execution
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 2.3/5 stars<br/><br/>I really don't what all the fuss and universal praise for ""Inside Out"" is about. It's a juvenile attempt at trying to portray elements as complex as human emotions and our state of mind in different situations.<br/><br/>Sure, there were some good scenes and likable characters, and some plot elements do hit the mark, but, overall, Directors Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen, and their cowriters Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley tried tempering the whole gamut of human emotions, and end up ignoring or stifling the deeper aspects of our psyche and personalities. It would have been fine if they had stopped at portraying the lead protagonist, who was a little girl, in that light. But, when they also showed her parents to be reactive in the same manner, you do sense something fundamentally wrong with a film attempting to unravel our emotional psyche without having the gall to touch upon all our emotions. Even when it came to our protagonist, it would've made better sense to have showed more complex emotions lying dormant inside a young girl. For instance, what happened to love, hatred, affection, despair, passion, regret, relief, envy, contempt, courage, contentment and similar other feelings. Everything cannot be encapsulated and simplified under the five basic emotions displayed in the film: joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the filmmakers didn't want to delve so deep, this being a kid's film and all. But, they always targeted the film at both adults and children right from the promotional campaigns, and the film itself emanates that vibe of wanting to cut across age demographics. And, therein lies the inherent problem with ""Inside Out"" - in trying to please all sections of the audience, it ends up being to heavy and cluttered for kids, and too immature and insouciant for adults. Even if I choose to ignore these obvious shortcomings, ""Inside Out"" is still a weakly made film. The narrative gets unbelievably messy in the second half and most of the plot elements are all over the place. More surprising is how many of the attempts at humor - usually Pixar's forte - seem labored and flat. To put it bluntly, ""Inside Out"" takes some good ideas and executes them with middling results and sans any conviction."

Trailers make it seem complicated, but the film is not that much difficult to grasp. Kids are going to enjoy this. It might become my favorite Pixar movie ever, but I will have to watch it 5-6 times to decide if it is really that good.<br/><br/>The concept was really good, but I was skeptical about the screenplay as it is not easy to put a subject like this into words. I must say that they have worked really hard on this film and the best thing is that the hard work paid off.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp and witty. There are scenes of sadness and fun and you won't feel like you are missing something. It touches you because everyone has felt these kinds of emotions, no matter what their age is. There are some big LOL moments that will make you laugh out loud and there are some scenes that will make your feel sad. So you can be pretty sure that it has everything a movie needs. All the characters are lovable.<br/><br/>The animation is breathtaking and wonderful as other Pixar movies.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a film without a great message. I kept thinking about it for a long time. It made me remember my childhood. I used to have the same kind of emotions that I couldn't explain. I cried when the movie ended.<br/><br/>Inside Out will appeal to both the young and adult audiences.

","We are a ""Disney"" family as my wife would say, my daughter is nearly 5 and we love most things Disney and Pixar. I had high hopes for this, perhaps too high and that is where my frustration lies. Where Wall-e succeeded in being a great film with little dialogue, this felt the polar opposite, with too much dialogue and repetition and way too little humour for a film of this genre. The trailers are I'm afraid the funniest parts of the film, but few other bites of humour emerge anywhere else in the film. <br/><br/>Where this film succeeds, however, is in its ability to still captivate the imagination and draw you in! Despite having its flaws I still enjoyed this film and most importantly so did my little daughter. It is a little dark at times but hardly throughout and it's still suitable for young kids, just be aware that if you are expecting a multitude of slapstick humour and silly jokes aplenty then you will be disappointed.

The string of disappointments would continue over the next two years with Brave and Monsters, University, both of which were criticized for not being up to par with the studio's best, until the legendary animation house decided to take a break in 2014 and refocus its efforts on quality. Now that the wait is over, Inside Out looks to be the first of Pixar's newest batch of films. And, fortunately, the wait was well-worth it.<br/><br/>Inside Out tells the tale of 11 year-old Riley Anderson, who moves one Autumn day with her parents to San Francisco to help her father succeed in business. Riley is controlled by her core emotions, the perky Joy, the mopey Sadness, the bratty Disgust, the cowardly Fear and the hot-headed Anger, who monitor her brain activity and keep her safe. But when Sadness accidentally messes with Riley's memories, she and Joy are sucked outside of headquarters to leave Anger, Disgust and Fear to rule Riley on their own. But Joy has always been their leader, so now she and Sadness are forced to make their way back before Riley slips into complete depression.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the most-obvious compliment I can give this movie is the same one I can give all of Pixar's movies: it looks amazing. Pixar is no stranger to rendering environments and details that many animation studios, even the high-end ones, would outright ignore, and this is no exception. But Inside Out has the distinct advantage of tackling the world of the human brain in a fun and colourful way. The main area that deals with emotions, for example, is a simple control panel surrounding by gears, while the memories themselves are colour-coded to indicate the dominant emotion they're connected to. Riley's core personality traits are indicated by literal islands with highways that connect to central, while long-term memory is a labyrinth-like library where memories are stored. And, of course, the forgotten memories are hoisted away and thrown into a dump where they decay. It's little details like these that really stretch the limits of creativity and make the film a perfect candidate for the medium of animation.<br/><br/>The voice acting is also spot-on. Amy Poehler is brilliant as the Peter Pan-esque Joy, showing her energetic side while also highlighting her domineering personality. Mindy Kaling is equally wonderful as the valley-girl-esque Disgust, while Phyllis Smith really adds humanity to the often dour Sadness and Bill Hader makes the one- note Fear into a real joy to watch. But the obvious stand-out is Anger, who's perfectly fitted to Baby Boomer comedian Lewis Black. He not only steals the show whenever he speaks, but his character is so much fun to watch that I often wished the movie was about him. The side-characters are also well-voiced, although I do wish a certain side-character had been given to Jim Carrey instead of whom they did get.<br/><br/>But what really makes this movie work as well as it does is its underlying message about life itself. Far too often, we associate our emotions with obstacles that clash against intellect, hence trying to suppress them. Inside Out, however, argues that that's not the case, reminding us, in-between laughs, that the two go hand-in-hand. More importantly, however, it argues that our negative emotions aren't so negative, but rather instinctive responses that have their place in life. It's a gutsy move on Pixar's part, but considering their past repertoire it's also not too surprising.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside Out was glorious from start to finish. For a studio that's been struggling with quality these past few years, it's nice to see a return to form, even if only temporary. Time will tell if Inside Out becomes a personal favourite, but for now it's easily in my Top 5 Pixar films of all-time. It's also, not surprisingly, the most fun I've had in theatres this year so far. I simply can't recommend it enough.<br/><br/>5/5."

","I was expecting this animation film to be something out of the ordinary due to all the hype and it did not disappoint!!!<br/><br/>From start to finish this film had me on the strings. The description of the emotions and various feelings are so accurate and the memories they use is something that most of us can relate to. The main idea of the movie kicks in right in the beginning and goes on an emotional roller coaster up until the credit scenes.<br/><br/>Generally I am a rock when I watch movies or cartoons, but this made me feel so many different things and there are some really sad moments where you simply can't hold yourself together any more whether it is sadness or laughing....<br/><br/>This film leaves you with a lot to think about at the end and it is by far the best animated film that Pixar came up with and it is definitely one of the best cartoons ever made.<br/><br/>Recommend it to viewers of all ages :)"

","""Inside out"" is a beautiful contemplation of how the organization called ""Brain"" works. While undoubtedly this will be a roller-coaster ride for children, I believe this movie could be an eye-opener for all age groups, especially when one is conscious exhibit various types of emotions. It conveys a constructive message that whether it's joy or sadness, expressing yourself will make it joy. A mathematical analogy would be as follows: if joy is positive(+) and sadness is negative (-), the movie infers the following conventions: Expressing a feeling is positive (+) and being an introvert is negative (-). By which, joy*expression= sadness*expression=positive(joy,expression)<br/><br/>Such a great message in a cute animee movie targeted for the kids.<br/><br/>Take a bow Pete Docter!"
"drfit","10","2","25","5 December 2015"," An Amazing Movie
","I have never written a review but after reading some of the negative reviews of this movie I had to speak up. Inside Out manages to entertain and educate from young to old on multiple levels. The five basic human emotions, well known to practicing therapists or anyone studying psychology, become living characters. They take part in a story that the viewer can easily relate to and enjoy. As expected from Pixar the animation is fantastic and the background score fits perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie should be a first week requirement for Psych 101 in any college yet, my 4 year old granddaughter loves it, watches it repeatedly and understands the basic concepts. I recently sat her on my lap and asked her what were the 5 basic human emotions. She quickly listed the emotions and reminded me, ""Papa, you can't have joy without sadness."" When you can entertain and educate a 4 year old and a 67 year old, make them laugh and cry together, and make them want to watch again and again you've really done something special. Thank you Pixar. And, to all those negative reviewers remember, ""You can't have joy without sadness."""
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","2","25","26 November 2015"," PIXAR's most complex film yet.
","Inside Out surprised me, and I'd dare say that it also surprised the millions who've watched it as well. The film is deep in an emotional way and even with the emotions of a little girl visualized for us to understand what she's feeling, there is still room for narrative subtlety. The emotions don't control us; they merely reflect the turmoil we face in life and the battle is almost completely internal for some people. That's what makes Inside Out such a good film; it's not just a magnificent story done with beautiful and sparkly visuals, but a thesis on the human psychology shown through animation. <br/><br/>Inside Out has all the good factors which many computer animated films have on average lacked; it doesn't abuse pop-cultural references, it doesn't play a Lady Gaga or One Direction song for the millionth time: the film builds a world that is completely thought out in under Two hours. Achieving something like that in such a short amount of time is surely a sign of cinematic genius."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","2","25","26 November 2015"," Pixar Rises
","Pixar is back from the dead, baby. Rising up like a Phoenix from the ashes, the fallen studio once more takes their place among the gods of the movie-making business.<br/><br/>Okay, so Pixar didn't really leave; and contrary to popular belief, they didn't even stop being good. I did not love Monsters U and Brave, but I liked them alright. The only terrible thing they've done is Cars 2, and I am more than willing to forgive that. But Inside Out brings back the sort of emotional poignancy that we've come to not only expect, but depend on from The House That Steve Jobs Built.<br/><br/>The basic premise is witty: inside the head of an 11-year-old girl named Riley, there are five emotions, lead by Joy, that control her thoughts and actions. While it may not be entirely original, it takes the concept to places it hasn't gone before, which is what really counts. I love how they manage to make every emotion sound like they are coming from the perspective of this girl even as they're voiced by some of the biggest comedy stars in the world. The illusion is never broken; everything is captivating and aware. If it were up to me, I'd give this the Best Original Screenplay Award at the Oscars, but alas, it is not.<br/><br/>Now I could talk about many things, including the multi-faceted characters, the great-even-for-Pixar animation, that killer main theme, the stirring somberness of the movie, and so much else. But everyone has discussed all that and much more, as all those articles titled something along the lines of 'What Inside Out Gets Right and Wrong About the Human Head' by 'Mr. Fancy Neurologist' can attest to. So I'll skip by all that, at least for now. Everyone knows this is one of the greatest movies of the year. Allow me to talk about my personal experience.<br/><br/>The first time I watched this film, I only got about two-thirds of the way through (to about the part where Riley tries out for her new junior hockey team) before I couldn't watch anymore. I'd rather not disclose why, at least not here; but I had to have the partly finished version of this film in my head for the better part of a month. I only watched it all the way through today, and let me tell you... Wow, it is so much better than I thought. Not that I didn't like it before; the artistry and quick writing turned me on like a light bulb, and I could see why this was Pixar at its best. But all the themes and the storyline didn't quite come together until that final third. If you've watched this movie, you'll now something of what I speak.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's just the mark of a well-written movie; if you miss a major chunk, you're left with only part of a bridge. Movies that I've watched and liked because of one factor or another, but operated on lousy scripts, did not make me feel like I lost anything if I didn't see the last third. I think this is especially true for children's movies, which can easily fall into clichés if not done right. No, there's nothing inherently wrong with using clichés, but they don't add anything to the story, don't demand that you stay and watch.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is a real sense of subtlety and truth that this film carries about it. Perhaps it's the equivalent to that person who just draws all the attention by just standing there, but you don't know why until you are looking for it and break it down. The leads here are literally emotions, yet they're more three-dimensional than ninety-percent of anything out there.<br/><br/>20 years ago, Pixar released Toy Story. In a few more years, the people who watched that film as a kid will watch films like this with their kid. And hopefully, the people who watched this as a kid with those people will watch other Pixar films another 20 years in the future. Long live animation.<br/><br/>(P.S. I love how they manage to build a mindscape that both made sense and worked as a beautiful adventure world.)"
"elijahhandley","10","2","25","7 August 2015"," Forget Pixar, forget animated films - this is simply one of the most outstanding movies ever made
","I almost never go out of my way to review a film I just saw but I just couldn't resist here. I am a huge, huge fan of Disney/Pixar's work, and for a solid 12 years my favourite was 2003's Finding Nemo. I did not expect anything to replace it considering I am an adult now and I was a child in 2003. But Inside Out is quite simply something else entirely.<br/><br/>First of all, the concept of the film is something so delightfully original that I knew from the start I would at least be partly impressed by the movie. Cars, for example, is a nice enough film with a good message and funny characters, but at the end of the day, it's just an animated movie about talking cars. Inside Out, however, is set primarily in the mind of an eleven year old girl, Riley. Specifically, the main characters are representatives of her five basic emotions: namely Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear. These five, de facto led by Joy, influence Riley's actions, decisions and feelings from 'Headquarters' inside her conscious mind, and together they store Riley's lifetime memories as either being happy memories, angry memories etc.<br/><br/>This brings me on to another important point - the characters. Sometimes, even some of the best films have main/supporting characters that really don't need to be there. Not so with this one. All five of the emotions are important to the film - they all provide solid humour in their own unique ways. The same goes for other supporting characters in the film who I will not mention here, as you may want this to be a surprise if you haven't seen the film yet.<br/><br/>Another excellent point is the key aspect of any film - the plot. I will not spoil anything from the film, don't worry. But the plot of the film essentially sees Riley's emotions struggle to cope with a troubling event that badly impacts Riley's life. The event is not a huge deal by Pixar's standards - there's no death involved like with Finding Nemo or Up, but the way in which the film presents this simple event is part of what makes the film a triumph. Inside Out somehow manages to be perhaps the simplest, and yet the most complex, Pixar film to date, meaning it can be enjoyed immensely by small children, older children, teenagers and adults (parents with children or simply adults who love an animation). This film is easily capable of making you cry with both joy and sadness, which in itself is a key aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Inside Out is not as simple for children to understand as a film like Cars or Toy Story is. But, at least in this reviewer's opinion, Pixar have outdone themselves with their most outstanding release to date. A lot of critics have noted that animation has been in a bit of a funk lately - with Toy Story 3, Cars 2 and Monsters University, as well as Finding Dory, Cars 3, Toy Story 4 and The Incredibles 2 on the horizon, Pixar have started to rely far too much on making sequels and prequels to their films rather than creating new material. So I wouldn't be surprised if you were sceptical about going to see Inside Out. But if you are a classic Pixar fan, I HUGELY recommend that you give Inside Out a try. You will be very glad you did."
"troyputland","10","2","25","3 August 2015"," An incredible animation for everyone.
","Pixar are back with a blast. An absolute mind-blast. Inside Out is the most brilliantly thought out, original animation in Pixar's history. For all audiences to enjoy. Centering on a young girl named Riley, there is two sides to her story. The external one is simple: Riley and her parents move away from their home in Minnesota where she grew up, to downtown San Francisco. The internal one is more complex. An assortment of characters make up Riley's emotions. Very similar to The Numbskulls in The Beano comic. There's Joy (Poehler), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black), Disgust (Kaling) and Sadness (Smith). They control Riley's actions and reactions. Her brain is a complex machine. New memories are created, shaped in to colours matching the emotion (yellow for joy, blue for sadness etc.) and filed in to a huge maze-like database. There's the core memories, powering certain parts of Riley's personality. They part from their usual spot that keeps the cogs spinning, throwing Riley's external emotions in to chaos. Joy and Sadness, separated from the brain's hub, need to make their way back before Riley loses her personality traits completely. Inside Out is a joyful experience, even when it's sad. A movie for the masses. A playful understanding on how certain minds work, how families can come together, and how life needs every emotion once in a while. Furthermore, an imaginary friend named Bing Bong's the best imaginary friend ever imagined."

So you already knowhow good this animated film is going to be and it was! This movie was unique, creative and exciting. Without a doubt my favorite movie ever and I can watch over, and over, and over again! I give it a 10/10. I hope you agree with my opinion! Thank you Basic summary: Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school."

","When I first clicked play I expected a whole lot of things from Inside Out. I expected at a point for the movie to be childish, I expected it at a point for the movie to not tell an emotional story like many of the Pixar past movies, and I expected the movie to be mediocre like the movies Pixar was recently putting out. Inside Out changed that all for me.<br/><br/>Growing up with Pixar movies from, Toy Story, Monsters Inc, and The Incredibles I would never think in a million years Inside Out would somehow land on the top of my favorite Pixar movies. Pete Docter nailed this one and Inside Out just did that. Inside Out not only tells the story of an eleven year old girl growing up, but the brief sadness that comes with growing up. Even from the beginning, it had me thinking of me when I was young and how happy I was growing up in Pixar's golden age; through the beautifully composed score from Michael Giacchino.<br/><br/>The movie originally makes you believe that the things you love will always and only contain happy moments, when really its the exact opposite. Everything you love, family, friends, and sports all have moments you are feeling not only happy with, but also sad and angry. Pete Docter nailed this. He also proved that sometimes some sadness will lead to some of your best happiest moments in your life.<br/><br/>Inside Out was a pleasure to watch and brought Pixar back to making the most inspiring, creative movies that anyone has ever made."

If more people realised that changing emotions are just conflicting forces in your head that can be personified, then they could handle the challenges of life better.

The next day I was still thinking about this film, it is very thought provoking and it deals with depression in kids today. So on the one hand I didn't like it because it was not a feel good Disney movie we are used to. But on the other hand if it can let preteens know they are not alone with depression then the movie is a success. Thankfully I don't battle depression but I know many that do.

","Inside Out has a great animation, it is a beautiful movie. And while I dislike the fact that the human is limited to 5 emotions, I understand that it is a kids movie and would make no sense to complicate it with several kinds of emotions.<br/><br/>My main complain is that it seemed by the trailers, that it would show us how the teenagers brain ""works"", what cause all of us to have that hard time in our lives. With that said, I thought everything would go wrong after some natural cause that happens with every teen by Riley's age. But I was really disappointed when all that mess happened because Sadness is a stupid pain in the ass, making the same mistakes over and over, and Joy is terrible and irritating manager.<br/><br/>Well, then the movie is telling what happened with Riley's brain only, not what happens to all kids'. That clearly shows that her emotions are not normal, in this case even psychological help wouldn't help, she needs some medication to regulate those emotions. I didn't finish the movie understanding my early life emotions but believing some kids really need medications!<br/><br/>I don't think it's fair to give less than 6 to this beautiful animation. But never 10! It has funny moments however I felt depressed most of the time. It has its moments, yet cannot be compared to classics like Lion King."

","Inside Out is the latest Disney Pixar movie from Oscar winning director Pete Doctor, best known for his work with other classics like Up, Monsters Inc., and the Toy Story movies. The film centers on the emotions that help to guide the life of a 12 year old girl named Riley. Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler, is the predominant emotion and serves as the leader inside Riley's head. As a result, Riley is a very happy and relatively care-free girl who greatly enjoys her life in Minnesota. However, things take a turn when her family moves to San Francisco for her father's work.<br/><br/>In Minnesota, Sadness, voiced by Phyllis Smith from The Office, was a relatively marginalized part of Riley's subconscious. However, as the family moves, Sadness begins to play a growing role without either her or any of the others really understanding why. Her actions lead Joy to try even harder to maintain control and keep Riley happy. However, those efforts result in calamity when she and Sadness are accidentally sent to another part of Riley's mind. As a result, Fear, Disgust, and, primarily, Anger are left to try and guide her through the tumultuous experience of adjusting to a new school and a new life while Joy and Sadness try to make the difficult trip back.<br/><br/>Over the course of their journey, Joy gains a greater appreciation for Sadness and the role she needs to play in Riley's life. Joy learns that for Riley to function, she can't always be happy and that there will be times where the other emotions need to take on a greater role. Ultimately, it's only when she steps aside and allows Riley to actually express her sadness without bottling it up that the young girl is able to cope with the move and embrace her new life.<br/><br/>Inside Out offers an entertaining yet powerful reminder of the need for emotional honesty. There may be times where it is necessary to set aside grief or anger in order to properly address the situation at hand, but when bottling up those emotions becomes a pattern it can only end in disaster. Jesus is perhaps our greatest example for understanding the benefits and the correctness of emotionally honest expression.<br/><br/>Joy is manifested throughout his life and ministry but is perhaps best seen in the delight he takes when interacting with children and his disciples. However, we also see the other emotions displayed at various points in his life. He lived a sinless life but shows righteous anger and disgust when throwing the money changers out of the temple (Matthew 21:12-13). And he shows fear and sadness in the Garden of Gethsemane when he prays repeatedly for a way to avoid the cross if God's will could still be accomplished by doing so (Matthew 26:36-46).<br/><br/>Ultimately, Jesus understood that while control was necessary, so was appropriate emotional expression. His life demonstrates a level of balance that can only be achieved when we realize that each of our emotions has its proper, God-given place in our lives. Acting otherwise by attempting to marginalize some aspect of our nature, whether it be sadness, anger, or any of the others, can prevent us from living the kind of life to which God has called us. In that way, it is quite similar to sin even if we may not often see it as such.<br/><br/>So which emotions do you struggle to express? Why is that? Knowing the answers to those questions and acting on that knowledge are the first steps towards greater balance and the ability to live the kind of full life for which God has created you.<br/><br/>So the next time you are tempted to set aside your first emotional impulse, stop and ask why that is. It may be that such action is necessary for the moment but never make it a pattern. Such repression is not healthy and, more importantly, it's not God's will for your life. He created you for more than that so live accordingly and you will know the kind of joy and peace that can only come from a well-balanced life."

","As with most Disney/Pixar movies, it started with another short film beforehand. This one was called ""Lava"". It is a musical about a lonely volcano who is longing for someone to be with him. He is singing about how lonely he is while over time he slowly starts to drifts into the sea. Later on we run into a female volcano who is already at the bottom of the sea. She he hears his song and thinks it was meant for her. Soon after that, he finds himself at the bottom of the sea but he is sad because he is stuck behind her and that she can't see him (because volcanoes can't turn around, silly). She then erupts and sprouts back up from the sea and he is sad once again because he can't erupt and sprout back up with her. Eventually, he then erupts and comes back up from the bottom of the sea and conveniently (because it's a Disney movie) sprouts out right next to her and the animation makes it look like they are caressing. Oh, and of course they are both singing together and the song happens to be very corny and cheesy.<br/><br/>Now it is time for the main movie. Inside Out is about a young girl named Riley and her emotions, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Her emotions have been guiding her all of her life living every day and seeing it from her point of view. They would control her actions and dictate her reactions to every moment in her life from the headquarters in her mind. One day, her world turns upside down when her and her parents move from Minneapolis to San Francisco. We spend most of the movie within the confines of Riley's mind starting with the headquarters where all of the emotions live. In there, they create memories which are encompassed within orbs colored by the emotion who created it. Her memories power different aspects of her personality while her core memories power amusement park like structures called memory islands. The stress caused by Riley's sudden move brings the character of Sadness to the limelight. When Joy and Sadness are inadvertently swept into the far reaches of Riley's mind, the only emotions left in Headquarters are Anger, Fear and Disgust to pick up the pieces. The world being introduced before this and especially afterwards is simply breathtaking in how vibrant, colorful, and how expansive it is. From the library of her long-term memories to the memory islands and the film studio producing her dreams, the imagination being shown here is not often seen in an animated film. A thing they did which I liked was that they showed the emotional process going on in other people's minds as well as Riley's. They also showed how similar they were even down to the same looking characters representing each emotion and the subtle differences between Riley's emotions and there's. I wished they did that more. The way the characters play off of each other was entertaining to watch especially because of the performances of the voice actors and the original writing being either the script or just the whole story. It is just the right amount of funny and sad while we see what each character experiences. It is a deep movie that can not only entertain children but it can also keep adults engaged despite being just a touch too long. I would definitely recommend this movie. This year is only half way done but this has to be the 2nd best movie I've seen this year. The best movie still is a sci-fi movie called Ex Machina which came out earlier this year which I also strongly recommend.<br/><br/>keithlovesmovies.com"

","A young girl's emotions set out on a rescue mission when she becomes increasingly sad following her family's move to the big city to start a new life.<br/><br/>Disney brings the concept of the Numskulls to a new level. The animation explores a sometimes nightmarish world, where a simplified set of emotions is personified in a team of bumbling characters that negotiates a landscape of threatening imagination and cold, industrialised memory processes.<br/><br/>The pace is pretty good, with an escalating roller-coaster ride of challenges and defeats as the emotions struggle to restore the girl to her vibrant happy self, only to find another self is emerging. This kept veering into a darker narrative, and I guess the writers constantly had to push back into more wholesome territory with the girl's personal story overwhelmed by the more hectic experiences of team emotion.<br/><br/>Editing and performances are good, and the music hardly noticeable. Some decent laughs, but nothing great. Best scene is in the memory dump.<br/><br/>Overall, good and imaginative with a satisfying ending, but the plot maybe lacks a bit of drive as the link between the trauma of the move and the growing sadness lacks some truth and difficulty. I suppose this comes through in the upbeat preachiness and downbeat interference, respectively, of the characters Joy and Sadness."
"brchthethird","7","1","19","10 February 2016"," Makes up for a lack of plot with an abundance of creativity
","I'll admit to not being the biggest Pixar fan, but that's mostly because American computer animation usually isn't as compelling as other stuff I like. I also don't prefer overly ""kiddie"" movies anymore, thanks to no longer being a kid. That being said, INSIDE OUT is one of Pixar's better films, even if I didn't love it as much as something like UP. To its credit, INSIDE OUT is actually more geared towards the older crowd, since a lot of the psychology of emotions will probably go over younger children's heads. In this sense, Pixar finds themselves in a bit of a bind. While expertly realized visually, literalizing the emotions just makes their manipulation that much more evident and, in my opinion, less effective. That's not to say it's all bad, because there were a number of moments that I thought were cute and funny. Its greatest fault is slow-burning an emotional payoff on top of such a thin story. In the end, though, I was won over thanks to the excellent visuals, inventive conceptualization, and outstanding voice work. Lewis Black as Anger has to be one of the best, and most spot-on, castings ever. It also wouldn't be a Pixar movie without a tearjerking moment or two. When it's all said and done, INSIDE OUT isn't the best Pixar movie ever, but it's an improvement over their last few."

","Pixar's Inside Out Review<br/><br/>The Awesome: This movie is a Psych Majors dream. Since I am a former psych major, I throughly enjoyed the explanation of concepts, dreams and ideas. They even venture to explain puberty and abstract thoughts along with long-term memory retention. I loved the view and graphics of the film. It is a very mentally enlightening film. Sadness played by Phyllis Smith was easily my favorite character. She was followed by Bing-Bong.<br/><br/>The Meh: I loved most of the voice actors. I feel like they did a great job portraying their characters and roles EXCEPT Amy Poehler. I don't wanna be nit-picky, but sometimes during the film, her voice didn't seem to match her character. Maybe it is because usually when I think of Amy Poehler I think of anger, angst or sex. Not Happiness and joy. Regardless, she does a decent job. Mindy Kaling played Disgust. I wish her and Amy switched roles, even tho Amy's name would draw in more adults, I think Mindy would have done a better job and Pixar could have had a first ever Hindu-lead of an animated film. IDK just saying, I think she would have did a better job and I would have won over the Public Relations crowd. W/e I also wish they did more venturing into other people's head.<br/><br/>The Terrible: Honestly nothing. The film is short and sweet and direct. For some reason, it will not be known as the ""Greats"" and I am going to venture on that point now. Abstract thought scene wasn't so necessary IMO.<br/><br/>The Overall: As I said before, it was an amazing film. Very scientifically sound and accurate and the research that the movie sunk into it shows. I cried on different times. If they spent even 3 more minutes in other peoples' heads, I would have been elated. However, that could be the Psychologist/Social Worker in me talking. Nice and tight film. Honestly, you cant talk down about it but nothing makes this movie stand out much except for the concept and imagination. Sadness steals the show to me. The film wont be mentioned alongside Toy- Story, Finding Nemo, Wall-E or the Incredibles. But it will be mentioned with Ratatouille, Bug's Life, Cars and Brave. RATING: 9/10﻿"

"Kicino","9","1","19","7 September 2015"," Fun, sad, education and inspiring at the same time: a creatively educational and emotional animation
","This is probably the only animation that I cried throughout. I cried while watching Up and some of Hayao Miyazaki's animation but this one somehow moved me with some very raw emotions. I was weeping and laughing while being educated/inspired at the same time.<br/><br/>Even when I saw the pre-animation song on Lava I felt like crying because the emotion was so sincere yet sad despite the relaxing Hawaiian style of tune. <br/><br/>The story is mainly about young Riley has to leave her hometown in Minnesota and move to San Francisco with her parents. During this transition she is sad to leave her friends and seems to have a hard time fitting in the new environment. The movie tells us how her emotions helped her deal with this big change in her life and how she can her family cope with the new environment.<br/><br/>I had no idea why I cried but whenever I saw the faded baby pictures and memories I cried. I like how different emotions in each of us are introduced and they all seem to have certain roles. I think it is very educational to see how our brain works – with different emotions taking turns dominating our thinking. Then the memories and experiences get together to form some islands which are our support systems. The movie uses very lively, tangible, and colorful balls/characters to symbolize some very abstract concepts and hard to see nerve systems so it is easy to follow. Watching the memories being sucked in tube and flying around I felt like watching the neutrons dashing within our brain via our nerve system. <br/><br/>While we usually values Joy, Sadness has a reconstructing effects on us too because when we are too sad, we need support and build something positive on our sad memories. That's how we have grown and become what we are today. It is also how we build our support system which hold us up. <br/><br/>I love this movie too much. The five emotions, core memories, the island/personalities and subconscious are really cute and fun. It is almost like going into someone's brain and see how they operate. In fact, everyone has a console like that and it was really fun to see the dinner scene when Riley was upset and Mom notices it and tries to signal to Dad to ask/comfort her. Too many stories to tell from this short scene: that women are more observant and sensitive but man are usually pre-occupied with one single thing at a time. They also have a tendency not to express themselves very well which makes matter worse. The train of thought is interesting too as the emotions goes around to look for Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong to call for support. But why do we have to let him die? It is so sad. <br/><br/>All in all, the main theme of the story is for us to be more aware of our emotions, be comfortable with them even though they may not make us feel good. Because only when we acknowledge our emotions can we then figure out why we feel that way and how we can deal with it and move on. Also, it is OK to tell others how we feel, it is how we receive support and mutually bond and grow stronger together. <br/><br/>I wish the other emotions play bigger roles in the movie because obviously they - Anger, Fear, and Disgust - protect us in their own ways too. Stay for the end credit which is interesting because it shows everyone's brain and how they help us cope with reality."

","I was studying angular js for 5 straight days now, btw (its a scripting language for the web) and decided to take a break, need to clear my mind. try to chill a little bit.. Went to the mall and check movies now showing in cinema. I remember my officemate told me about Inside out, so I watch it. The design of the movie was good. The plot is simple in the first layer. The View layer, where what we ordinary people really can see, the one where we can relate. But the real artistry of the movie is the linking, the connection of how the view is process and the explanation on how data is send for the view to response is very detailed and in some cases I can't help to think sounds legit. If I think of it, what makes this movie stands out for me is, the guy who made it make sure that the people viewing this after can tell themselves I should make sure and keep safe core memories, which is the fuel that keeps my life running. Core memories of Family, Friends, Personalities etc.. can be a type of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust or mix. Continue creating them and access them always from time to time. <br/><br/>I can always appreciate a good software, i mean a good movie once I see one, its just a balance of simplicity and complexity. My code review for this one is I would say good 8 out of 10, maybe revisions on the platform to where it is made. Its on animation and some people think of it as a: for kids movie, which assumption is true because its Disney. Which is not, in my opinion. I would love to have a more serious control room encounter, a Modular Testing for each emotion, preferably to a 25 age adult male, so I can also relate to how this colorful engrs in my head reacts in my multi tasking double life challenges that I face in a day to day basis."
"Medysofyan","Null","1","19","26 August 2015"," There is no bad emotion in 'Inside Out'
","For me, the film turns out to be more than what I expected: an emotional roller-coaster. It explores not only about the competition of five personified emotions inside an 11-year-old girl to control her actions, but also a dazzlingly picturesque imagery of a world inside a human's head. That includes some of astounding depictions of a mind map, such as Dream Productions, Emotions Head-quarters, Imagination Land, Long Term Memory Labyrinth, Personality Islands, and the creepy, dark chasm of Memory Dump.<br/><br/>The scenes mostly take place in the mind of a girl named Riley, who suddenly finds a bumpy road after being uprooted from her Midwest life as her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), who is the main emotion here, tries as best as she can to ensure Riley to be happy in the new city. However, the other four emotions, Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) dominate Riley's mind as she experience some culture shocks.<br/><br/>The condition is getting worse after Sadness touches some memory orbs containing the Minnesota's memories, making Riley desperately misses the old town and hate her current place. Joy tries to prevent Sadness from touching core memories but they accidentally plunged out of Head-quarters, leaving Fear, Anger and Disgust to take care the fragile girl. I'm sure you can predict what chaos that is going to happen next.<br/><br/>What I love the most about Inside Out, like other Pixar's films, is the ability to touch adult audiences through childhood memories and imagination. In Toy Story, we are all connected to the toys, and reminisce that we used to have a special toy. Inside Out has that charm too. Besides taking us to travel the dazzlingly animated world of Riley's mind, it also shows us the cherished memories that adults might forget about, including the joy of our parents when we were born, the fear of Grandma's vacuum cleaner and the weird Birthday clown, and a cheerful imaginary friend, which in Riley's mind, is a pink elephant named Bing Bong. I love Bing Bong so much I cried when he said Riley had stopped playing with him as she grew older — and told Sadness about a lost wagon-rocket: 'It's all I had of Riley.' I think Inside Out is one of the finest Pixar's animated ever made. I'm surprised that the film gets too much hatred for 'putting an adult theme into a child's movie'. I think it's a perfect movie to watch with the whole family, so the parents can understand what's exactly going on in their children's minds. The kids can learn about prime emotions and how they're all connected. The point is, there is no such thing as a bad emotion, that the emotions all have in common is that they are all about taking care of you."
"Eloquai","7","1","19","4 August 2015"," Great, but not 'Pixar Great'
","First off, I really enjoyed this film - it's fun, imaginative and clever (and fortunately much better than its sister short 'Lava'). Despite what I say next, I would still recommend watching.<br/><br/>However something was missing from the overall mix. The film begins with a lot of promise - in a few short minutes, the overall scenario is established quickly without swamping you in the technical details of 'Headquarters' and there's clear potential in the set-up: Riley, an eleven year old girl approaching the hinterland between childhood and adolescence, is leaving her old life behind and moving to a new and unfamiliar town.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the plot then starts to meander. Ironically, the biggest casualty of this is Riley herself, whose character and interaction with the real world is quickly lost within the narrative. Aside from her first day at school and a half-baked plot involving her escape from home, she is strangely underused as a character in her own right. It would have been fascinating to see her make new friends and to navigate the pressures of school and a new life in a new city.<br/><br/>Instead, the plot is centred on two primary emotions navigating the unstable terrain between various 'islands' at the back of her brain, assisted by Riley's long forgotten imaginary friend Bing-Bong. Whilst it's a fun plot that, by and large, works well on its own merits, it feels like the product of Disney's heavy hand instead of Pixar's acclaimed nuance. The elephant was, in my opinion, a mistake. There is no present and apparent connection between Riley and Bing-Bong and so the character's metaphorical role in representing Riley's transition to adolescence falls flat. While Andy's separation from Woody and Buzz worked so brilliantly in Toy Story, Riley's separation from Bing-Bong felt... meh. As soon as Joy and Bing-Bong fell into the chasm, it was pretty clear what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>And so the film grinds to a saccharine and predicable conclusion: Joy and Sadness work together in harmony, Riley gets off the bus and returns home and all is well and good again in Headquarters. Great, I loved it, but I can't help but feel that there's a far stronger version of this film somewhere on the writing room floor. A version that manages to successfully combine the real world with the events transpiring in Riley's head, a version where the emotions themselves are more complex figures, and a version that serves as a more confident meditation on the end of childhood.<br/><br/>It's a great film, but unfortunately it falls short of the high standards set during Pixar's 'Golden Era'. <br/><br/>--- Having said all this, I probably should highlight some of the positives for balance.<br/><br/><ul><li>The animation is nothing short of excellent. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The voice acting is also great. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I loved the brief forays into other people's Headquarters. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The dream studio scenes were fantastic. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole film was much better than Lava! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Joy and Sadness were brilliantly crafted as characters, if a little one-dimensional at times.</li></ul>"

Was wanting to go and see Inside Out since I first heard about it, as I thought it sounded like a good idea for a movie, unfortunately because we don't have kids, I had to work out a valid excuse to see it. So I tossed a coin to decide, lost the coin so listened to my inner child and went to see it.<br/><br/>What a lovely feel good movie. Was pleasantly surprised that some of the humour was aimed at adults (judging by the amount of adult laughs I could hear). Granted it's not one of Pixar's best but I think it ranks up as being a good animated film.<br/><br/>Character of Riley came across as a good Pixar character, listening to her own emotions/characters - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. For me Sadness was probably my favourite, as I actually laughed out loud with her. Joy for me I found a bit annoying and came across as a bit of a control freak, which was probably the idea! <br/><br/>Loved the scene at the dinner table where the mum & dad are talking, mum is trying to attract dad's attention but he's day dreaming of football, like me when my wife talks to me!<br/><br/>Film starts of well with the family moving, Riley having to deal with the turmoil and losing her friends and home, then because of an accident which ""seperates"" Joy & Sadness from her. She has to listen to Anger, Fear & Disgust. This is where for me I felt it was heading to a dark direction, started to wonder where the film was heading, but was glad to say that it ended nicely (which caused me to have s lump in my throat).<br/><br/>Was trying to spot the Pixar Easter eggs but couldn't spot them, although I did manage to hear the distinctive voice of Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger, a Pixar film wouldn't be the same without him!<br/><br/>If you want a nice family feel good movie, listen to your inner voice and go and see it.<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing loved the mini move just before the start - Lava Story (I think), don't why but I think I had a bit of dust in my eye at the end of it ;-)"
"wolf-82246","9","1","20","10 December 2015"," Enjoyable/Applicable for All!
","Every movie has its problems, but ""Inside Out"" is ingenious thanks to Pixar's humorous and creative depiction of abstract realities in mental processing.<br/><br/>Likewise, this is definitely a ""must see"" for the entire family but especially because of the beneficial theme and role of Sadness. First, let's build some context. In this movie, a conflict arises between Riley's emotions Joy and Sadness. Previously in Riley's life, the core memories were guarded by Joy because all the emotions agreed that this was best and that this was Joy's overarching role. Further, it seems that none of the emotions can figure out Sadness's role in ""headquarters"", the place where the emotions react to Riley's life. As a consequence, Sadness becomes depressed and touches the core memories which seemingly leads to confusion/devastation in Riley's life. However, the emotions have misinterpreted Sadness's role. Unsure of her place, Joy and Sadness travel to ""long-term memory"" to retrieve Riley's core memories in an attempt to change them back to pure Joy-filled memories. In the end, the emotions learn that memories and experiences in life can have mixed emotional responses that are healthy. Essentially, the emotions each learn their place and take turns touching the memories of Riley together and separately. They learn that the moments with mixed emotions are often more powerful and give room for greater growth in Riley's life. As a consequence, they make it their practice to give each of the emotions opportunities to help Riley cope with life. <br/><br/>Interestingly, Pixar accurately portrays a real-world problem that affects every human being. We live in a world that struggles in figuring out what to do with pain. Some people react by suppressing their pain, as the emotions attempted to do in the movie. Some people let their pain rampantly control them, as Sadness did when she had unhealthy control. Regardless, on any part of the continuum what do people do with pain? Where does pain belong? In the movie, the beautiful moment that answers this question occurs when Riley shares her pains with her parents and Joy and Sadness both touch the memory. This resolves the problem of pain because it is shared in honesty and community with her parents. Riley expressed her personal struggles and sadness with her parents and through empathy they reconnect and Riley grows as a person. Sadness is thus seen as a key role in that through her abilities to help Riley, Riley is able to open up to her parents. Further, it opens Riley's life to giving of herself empathetically which is a timeless message needed by all generations and cultures. Essentially, Pixar reminds viewers that many times joy is found through sadness or difficult circumstances. It is through these defining moments that we grow as people and are changed for the better. In fact, many times it is through these painful moments in life that we find true community with those we love and care for most. <br/><br/>An example from my life that confirms Pixar's depiction that joy comes through sadness is in the story of a someone I know. This person's father died by committing suicide. While at an event, this person was secretly grieving and unsure of whether or not he could share his grief story with others. Somehow he decided he was going to share his father's story. After he shared what happened, two younger girls at the same event came up to him and shared with him that they had been having suicidal thoughts. Thankfully, he was able to empathize and encourage these two girls away from their negative thoughts by showing how his father's death affected others who were still living and grieving his loss. In effect, this man was thankful for his circumstance because he had the knowledge that the story of his father's death saved the lives of two young girls, and many thereafter. Though this is an extreme example of this principle at play, it is no less a true example of how humans find joy through sadness. I am thankful Pixar depicted Sadness as a reality of life and as a meaningful part of life. Without an understanding of true sadness, it is hard or impossible to appreciate and understand joy to its fullest potential. Thus, Pixar's ""Inside Out"" is a must see that is applicable to every person who lives and feels, and provides an appropriate conclusion of what to do with our sadness."

Today many previews or reviews announce that a certain film is family friendly—a film that engages all ages. Most of the time, the film turns out to be much more geared towards the younger generation. ""Inside Out;"" however, actually is geared towards all ages. Because the film is so understandable, the younger and older generation can relate to it in many ways, and that is why I am giving show film a four and half stars out of five.<br/><br/>While watching the film for the first time, I felt many different emotions. I felt nostalgic; I was longing for the days of my childhood. I felt happy because of how accurately they portrayed the emotions of children, men, and women. Lastly, I felt sad because the film tugged on my heart and showed the emotions we all go through when we are in tough times, such as moving away from home, not knowing what makes you special, making new friends, or forgetting the old friends— even the imaginary ones. This year's new Pixar film, ""Inside Out,"" is definitely one for the whole family to see.

A few sourpusses have tried to seize the moral high ground here by complaining it's all about blond white-girl privilege and first-world problems I'm sure if I dug deep enough on this site I'd find somebody who didn't like this animated movie (for age 6 and up) because it fails to adequately address the housing crisis in San Francisco (which, seen through the eyes of an outdoorsy 11-year-old from Minnesota, looks like a grim and dingy hellhole).<br/><br/>Some of the commenters here and on the NY Times website have also complained that the theoretical background was all wrong or the movie wasn't inculcating the right values in our children; I was too entranced by the storyline, the jokes (notably the sightgag that sets up the line quoted above and the one about the hairy guy who looked like a bear) and the visuals to pay much attention to such things. Maybe I'll be able to opine on that after we've watched two or three more times<br/><br/>""Inside Out"" is delightful. My wife and I aged out of the demo many years ago, but we were chortling and tearing up in all the right places. The script is smart and funny; the concepts behind the animation are incredible—I'll go out on a limb and say they compare in imaginative daring with Doré's illustrations for Dante and Paradise Lost. (As with Dante and Milton, the symbolism gets a little murky at times, at least for an adult, and I'm not sure the plot mechanics are internally consistent. Didn't care!) The voice actors are perfectly cast—a special shoutout to Richard Kind (our UWS neighbor) as imaginary playmate Bingbong. <br/><br/>One final point—along with ""The End of the Tour,"" this one seems like the only decent VOD rental available from Time Warner at the moment."
"lucasversantvoort","9","1","20","18 November 2015"," Finally another Pixar classic
","After hitting a rough patch the past couple of years, Pixar was losing momentum. It had to get its act together and fast. With Inside Out, the folks at Pixar have done just that and then some.<br/><br/>Inside Out is about a young girl, Riley. More specifically, it's about the bubbling personalities inside her mind that symbolize various emotions: there's Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust. The occupy the headquarters inside Riley's head where they discuss how they should respond to what Riley's experiencing. Depending on which emotion's running the show, Riley will behave in a certain way. New memories are created all the time and they're shaped like colored balls. Depending on the kind of memory it is, it'll have a different color. If it's a happy memory, it'll be yellow; if it's sad one, blue, etc. Riley and her parents move from Minnesota to San Francisco, but it's not a pleasant change for Riley. She has trouble adapting to her new home, the new school and so on. Things get out of hand when the two crucial emotions, Joy and Sadness, are accidentally ejected from HQ and launched into the memory database which are shaped like islands, each with its own theme. With Joy and Sadness removed, Riley's demeanor worsens and it's up to Joy and Sadness to rush back to HQ to restore balance.<br/><br/>When you read about the story, you immediately start imagining the possibilities. Pixar could have a field day with a story about a young girl's mind...and they do. Inside Out contains all kinds of wonderful visualizations of the human mind.<br/><br/>However, to broach the topic of the mind is also fraught with danger. It makes sense for a film to set some rules for itself, rules it has to follow. On the other hand, this is the mind we're talking about, where everything's possible. The main issue I had unfortunately involved the central problem of the film: Joy and Sadness are ejected from HQ and have to go back before Riley does something drastic. Why can't Joy and Sadness just, oh I don't know, teleport or 'wish' themselves back into HQ? They're emotions! Oh, I get why Pixar went this route: they wanted to explore more aspects of the mind in a smart and funny way. Therefore, Joy and Sadness have to be ejected from HQ just so they (and we) will stumble upon Imagination Land, the 'train of thought', Riley's long-term memory storage and those personality islands I mentioned earlier. It adds to the variety and I get that. I just feel that applying these physical handicaps to Joy and Sadness makes no sense, since they are, you know, emotions.<br/><br/>This minor (or major, depending on how you look at it) flaw aside, the film's a lot of fun, particularly those involving the complex machinations of the mind. You've got a literal train of thought and the absolutely hilarious scenes involving an assembly producing tight-jeaned imaginary boyfriends who proudly proclaim they would die for Riley. You've got two workers discussing which memories will be removed from storage (which US Presidents are more important to remember). You've got a dark cave symbolizing the subconscious where giant clowns and grandma's vacuum cleaner reside. The list goes on.<br/><br/>There's a key scene towards the end where Sadness plays a huge part. I won't spoil exactly what happens, but let me just say that Sadness plays a positive role in the story's outcome, surprising given her general uselessness and the chance of her accidentally corrupting positive memories. Her presence actually contributes to Riley's emotional well-being. In a world where we're bombarded with messages telling us that 'life is a game', to stay happy and party hardy (Coca Cola commercials spring to mind), it's nice to see Pixar telling kids (and adults) it's okay and healthy to be sad. (I'd add, as long as it doesn't control your life, but that's another story.) In the end, the positives outweigh the inevitable plot holes that arise when dealing with stories about the mind. Pixar (or, more specifically, Pete Docter and his team) has managed to tell a moving tale about the human mind in a way that's both endearing and funny. Part of me hopes Pixar will pull a 'Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight' and produce a sequel with a more mature Riley. Think of the possibilities: there could be new emotions, new interactions between these emotions, the landscape of Riley's mind could change to reflect the new phase of her life, etc. *sighs* If only Pixar accepted fan suggestions..."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","20","21 June 2015"," Pixar's great emotional journey.
","It is such a joy to report that Pixar is back in form. After a few years of weak soup, it's so nice to see them back on the track that made us fall in love with their confections in the first place. In the animation game, Pixar was always been the better factory, churning out creative projects that were destined to last for generations while their rivals simply spat out quickly made product mounted solely on what was popular at the moment. But after Up six years ago, the studio seemed to have lost its way and they haven't produced greatness since. At least, until now.<br/><br/>The movie, for the most part, takes place inside the head of Reilly Anderson, an 11 year-old girl from a nice family who is suffering the slings and arrows of approaching adolescence. Inside her brain is the complex that make up the core of her being, driven by Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler); Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), Fear (voiced by Bill Hader); Anger (Lewis Black) who dresses like middle-management; And Disgust (voiced by Mindy Kailing).<br/><br/>The movie is original in it's approach. It begins on the day Reilly is born as the palette of her inner being begins to form. First a ball of light, then a pixie figure called Joy. Little Reilly's mind is a blank slate that very quickly forms the emotional core of her being. Along with Joy come Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. What her mind eventually evolves into is a complex of emotions, feelings, trains of thought, ideas, images, moods and memories.<br/><br/>The quintet at the controls all form the core of Reilly's current mood. Joy seems to have the lead most of the time, but there's never a sense that anyone is elbowing anyone out of the way. Everyone has their turn at the console of Reilly's current emotional state. The key battle comes between Joy and Sadness. Joy sees Sadness as an unnecessary element to Reilly's state of harmony, but Sadness knows that in order to achieve harmony one must experience sadness to get to joy.<br/><br/>Every minute of every day, Reilly's brain produces a memory that is represented as a tiny marble colored by whatever emotional state the memory comes from. Those memories are either stored in Long Term; stored in a special place for Core Memories; or are disposed of all together. What comes of Reilly's current experience is juxtaposed by what has happened before. New things come in and old things go out - some are stored in her long term memory, some are buried in her subconscious, and old, forgotten memories are deposited into a dark chasm where they eventually evaporate from existence much like a deleted file on a computer.<br/><br/>The drama begins with a change in Reilly's life. Her parents are uprooting from Minnesota to San Francisco, meaning that Reilly has to leave behind friends, and the best memories of her childhood. Her churning emotional states breed confusion, and anger, and resentment forcing a battle between Joy and Sadness mostly due to Joy's concern that Sadness will infect core memories (when she touches them they turn blue). The two end up outside the command center with no way to get back, leaving Reilly's supplementary emotions, Fear, Anger and Disgust at the controls. What lies on the other side is the strangest journey since Alice fell down the rabbit hole. Joy and Sadness take a strange journey through the recesses of Reilly's ever-changing brain, particularly the Long Term memory library that is often cleared out when Reilly no longer needs them.<br/><br/>The script draws a very clean line between what is happening to Reilly in the world and the universe inside her head. Things are changing, evolving, breaking down, rebuilding – in other words, she's growing up. And just as Reilly doesn't understand these changes, neither do the representations in her brain. The tragedy of what happens to the trappings of childhood once Reilly has moved past them is a key theme here, expressed most achingly in the form of a circus elephant named Bing-Bong (beautifully voiced by Richard Kind), who once served as Reilly's imaginary friend, but now lingers in the forgotten realms of her brain, always aware that he is many years late for the memory dump. Bing-Bong is a tragic figure who, much like Jessie the Cowgirl in Toy Story 2, is a figure whose purpose dried up long ago.<br/><br/>Much more of the plot, I cannot discuss. What has been described here only scratches the surface. Let me just say that as with last year's The LEGO Movie, this is an animated feature made with loving care, a story told by writers and animators that aren't satisfied to nail down their story to a pat formula or to whatever colorful bupkis they can sell at McDonald's. The people behind Inside Out - that being screenwriters Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and Peter Docter writing from a story by Reynoldo del Carmen - want to make something special, something that will linger in your mind. They've taken the animated genre and they've stretched it to the limit in an effort to create something special. They've created a great journey, an emotional journey. One that will last for generations to come."

","Inside Out is a original and a clever Movie about mind-manipulation, this film is gorgeous-looking and one of the best Pixar has done in a good long time. The film's acting and charm is what makes it a emotional experience for both kids and adults, here's why.<br/><br/>The plot is original, it follows Riley, a normal 11-year old who moves to San Francisco With her mom and dad, and inside Riley's mind are Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger who each produce emotions to Riley every time they Control her mind, but when Sadness touches one of the memories of Riley by accident, Joy and Sadness get sucked into the world of Islands which follows what kind of stuff Riley likes and hates and barks on a quest for Return before she gets neutral and out of Control.<br/><br/>The characters are memorable and touching, every emotion has Development and the best character to me from all emotions is Anger, his character just Cheers me up, Bing Bong is a good character and the Unicorn's a good minor character.<br/><br/>The animation is their best work yet, With so much detail and lighting, that it looks like a painting, the complicated concept is stunning, it gives a New direction for Pixar, compared to their simple plot Points in their previous films, this one is a tough watch due to it's emotional but realistic turn, but their children will love it.<br/><br/>The film is one of the most heartfelt Pixar films i've seen, the film is both funny and sad at the same time, the part where Riley takes mom's credit card and leaves is upsetting yet intense, that was the most intense part to me.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a outstanding achievement in Pixar's career, both funny and heartfelt, With outstanding animation, heartfelt story and original and smart concept, the only downside is that awful short film, which i'll review a another day.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dfa120374","7","1","22","9 January 2016"," Not As Good As I Was Hoping, But Still Very Enjoyable
","I have to admit - even though I enjoyed Inside Out, I don't think it was really as good as some other Disney/Pixar movies I've seen, such as Wreck It Ralph, Brave, or the Toy Story series. That doesn't mean to say it's not worth watching because it is, but it just got a bit stale through the middle where it's a wee bit stop/start in certain places, and got a bit repetitive with some of the characters. For instance, Sadness would touch something she's not ""supposed"" to and Joy would keep telling her not to as they went from one disaster to the next. It becomes logical at the end, I know, but still felt too repetitive like I say.<br/><br/>I think that's my only real complaint and it's probably that that stopped me from giving the film a 4-Star rating because I loved everything else. The animation, the story, the humour, the whole idea on a person's long term/short term memory, subconscious, how the emotions are made to control a person etc.<br/><br/>It really is a very imaginative story.<br/><br/>The whole thing actually reminded me of my days as a kid when I used to read comics called The Beano, The Beezer, and The Dandy that featured a comic strip called The Numskulls...same concept as the film but obviously on a much smaller scale.<br/><br/>It's a pretty emotional film as well as we're taken on a journey right from the start of Riley's life...growing up with her, going through her emotions as she reaches those early teen years, the ups and the downs along with her parents. Not to dissimilar to Up, actually (which I enjoyed)...another of Pete Docter's animated films. So with that, you feel a kind of connection to everything that happens to Riley, which, for me, is good because it helps draw you into the story much more.<br/><br/>Be prepared for one tear-jerker of a scene though.<br/><br/>The whole movie overall is a very enjoyable experience, and while it's not as good as I was hoping, it's still another memorable Disney/Pixar flick."
"ahmet-erik0","10","1","22","7 August 2015"," A joy
","Yeah i used an emotion pun, sue me.<br/><br/>Inside Out is a film I've been hyped for, we got no Pixar film at all last year, but it has been worth the wait because Inside Out more than makes up for it. All i will talk about here is the basic premise. I went into this film knowing only that and it was for the best as it was a genuine surprise. Riley is an 11 year old girl growing up with her parents and moving house which is always a time of mixed emotions. Speaking of emotions, her mind is controlled by 5 of them Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The way these emotions control her mind is so clever and fun to see. The standout is Lewis Black as Anger. He was incredibly funny and a joy to watch (ironically). I also love Amy Poeller as Joy. The cast was perfectly chosen and she is pure proof of it. She is relatable and we feel for her as all she wants is the best for Riley, like another character in the film who i feel i can't talk about as this character in particular comes as a genuine surprise.<br/><br/>Joy and Sadness go on a journey to preserve Riley's memories, leaving the other emotions in charge. I also loved this as it gave us some of the funnier moments of the film to see how her mind worked with limited emotion. The cleverness came from the simplest things such as how a certain advertisement can get stuck in your head for days or how you forget a certain memory, but again i feel i have to keep these aspects brief. Sure it will sound like a cheap pun to say it, but Inside Out is the most emotional Pixar film for ages. Everyone will at least relate to one character or situation. Admit it, we all have a friend like Bill Hader's Fear. It makes me wonder how our minds actually do work. Emotions just seemed to get way more interesting. Its like the questions Toy Story put in our heads, but as weird as it sounds they seem more real here.<br/><br/>The way this film is given to us, it is more of an adult film. Pixar are great at giving us films that kids and adults will love, they have definitely done it again. It is so clever that all of the references to real life that we are given will fly straight over kids heads, but they will love the journey and adventure Joy and Sadness go on. I like that a lot. I can't think of a single flaw i have with this film. The perfect film is something that is almost impossible to come by, yet this is probably the closest we will get. I knew this film would be great, but Inside Out exceeded all my expectations. It is literally a film for anyone and everyone. Well done Pixar, once again you have outdone yourself. I cannot recommend this film enough and i give it my highest rating of 10/10."

","This is a great movie. After seeing a poster, I thought the movie was for kids, but when I started watching a movie, it is actually for adult. I went to the movie with my friend and his kid. Oh Man, that kid did not fully understand the movie. Movie tells the audience the different aspect of the life. Sometimes we are happy, sad, angry, anxious, and so much more. Our mood changes a lot. If we are sad that does not mean we should not try to be happy, but sometimes sadness is needed in our life too. This movie tells us how to live our life as a happy person. It is actually trying to show what is going inside our mind, and how all these moods affect our lives. Over all the movie was great, and I enjoyed a lot, but I felt bad for that five years old kid."

","Writer-director Pete Docter has made two movies in one with this animated Pixar feature, both satisfying and both edifying for children and adults alike. On the one level, it's a fun adventure about an 11-year-old girl who must move from rural Minnesota to downtown San Francisco. On the other, it's what goes on in the mind of a child in the midst of life-shifting change. The voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Mindy Kaling and Lewis Black bring the profundity home in engaging fashion. For parents and children alike, a sure bet to provide grist for fascinating post-viewing conversation too. Well worth your time. (PG 1:42)"

","Inside Out and Mad Max Fury Road currently stand as two of the highest rated films of the year. Critical reviews shine as well as audience ratings, however only one belongs to the title of highest rated film of 2015 and that is Mad Max Fury Road, not Inside Out. Pixar's latest feature is likable and decent, but not as amazing as people are saying it is. <br/><br/>Inside Out lacks a consistent flow of chuckles, I smiled and nodded more as there are never any truly laugh out loud moments. This hour and a half feature felt longer, as the themes of depression completely padded out any potential comedy. However, I can't deny the voice work as it is excellent. Amy Poehler's unabashed optimism shone through even the most downbeat moments, Bill Hader is as entertaining as ever shouting and squealing with fear, and Mindy Kaling is sassy and does a great job as disgust, in fact I couldn't imagine anyone else fitted to it. For me, and my mates who I saw it with, found that Phyllis Smith who voiced sadness was the funniest and most effective. The drained feeling in her voice and lack of happiness serves the plot greatly throughout, especially in the ending. <br/><br/>The animation is vibrant, and whilst there are fine details seen in the people side of the film, I felt there was a lack of detail and depth inside the character heads scenes, which is where the majority of the film is set. It's far from Pixar's best work, yet people are hailing it as the finest since Toy Story. I just don't see it, I got a lot of stick from my mates and lecturers for not enjoying it as much as they did but tough, Inside Out is not all it's cracked up to be. The concept is really cool, and this film is admittedly perfect for both kids and old viewers, exploring the darker sides of emotions and what can go on in a persons head but what really lacks is a strong heart and comedy."
"quinnridzi","5","0","1","9 May 2020"," Could've been much better
","Personally, I thought that this movie would have been better if it spent more time in development. I mean, the idea was clever but it just did not turn out well. I did not like Reilly or any of the other emotions as they were annoying and so unlikeable. Joy is very selfish and annoying, Sadness is so irritating, the other emotions are just plain annoying. Also, Reilly has no personality. Yes, we do see her ""islands"" but if you watch the Reilly only scenes of the movie, you will notice that she is so bland and also selfish. Seriously, you are not in quarantine, Reilly! I also disliked the story. In the beginning, the introduction was so long and the story was so slow.
I also noticed that during the whole story, Joy and Sadness did the same thing over and over again throughout most of the movie: 1) Get to Island X. 2)Something happens to Reilly. 3) Island falls. 4) Go through random obstacles to get to the next one. I also disliked the messages the movie was trying to teach kids:1) You are not responsible for your actions. 2) You have no control over your life. 3) If your sad, your problems will be solved if you look sad. People will come and sort it out and you will feel joy again.<br/><br/>Overall, while I did not care for the story, I thought that the idea was clever and the animation was great."

","Inside Out, from director Pete Docter, is in my opinion the best movie Pixar has made so far. And this is Pixar we're talking about so that's saying something.<br/><br/>And it's not just because it's an engaging family friendly film where colourfully animated, fun-sized friends go on adventures together to get back home. Although, it is. It's not because it's gorgeously animated, and has some amazing textures, character designs and visual puns. Although, it is, and it has.<br/><br/>It's not even because it's a great story about growing up, learning to live in a new situation and remembering what's most important. Although, it most definitely is.<br/><br/>No, what separates Inside Out from other great Pixar films, from other great animated films in general, is how well it speaks about emotions, about their importance, about their nuance. This is a movie, which those people who are kids now and will grow up to become adults, will name as one of those movies that shaped them. Taught them, for example, that's it's okay to be sad. Essential even because how else would you feel empathy.<br/><br/>Personally I learned a lot watching The Lion King as a child. I learned about responsibility and trust. And I learned about the concept of death, about loss. And it was a good lesson.<br/><br/>This movie is on par with The Lion King. Better even in some ways. The story is perhaps not as engaging, but the morals and the lessons have even more impact.<br/><br/>A gem of a movie and hopefully we'll see more movies of this quality out of Pixar in the years to come."

","The success of any movie depends directly on its ability to forge an emotional connect between the characters who inhabit the movie and the viewer. The greater we feel with / for a character, identify / empathise with their predicaments, feelings, choices and actions, the higher the chances of a movie's success. What if the main characters in a movie are the basic emotions themselves..? Would it make it easier or difficult to forge an emotional connect with such a movie ?<br/><br/>Pixar, the path-breaking animation studio that presented us with such classic delights such as Toy Story series, Finding Nemo, Wall E, Up and many more have explored the above question in their latest ambitious animated feature, Inside Out. When 11-year old Riley, is forced to relocate from Minnesota to San Francisco with her parents, she undergoes an emotional roller-coaster as she is stressed out in adjusting to a new place even as she misses her hitherto dear home and friends. The movie captures this emotional turmoil of Riley by exploring the working of her mind through the interactions between her five basic emotions of Joy (a chirpy Amy Poehler), Sadness (adorable Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).<br/><br/>While the movie deserves kudos for its high quality and vivid animation which we have come to expect from Pixar, what makes it tick is the fact that Director Pete Doctor (Up & Monsters Inc.) who has co-written this movie has conjured up a magical movie which works at so many levels. He presents a lively animated feature which breaches the hitherto accepted horizons of its genre to bravely explore the abstract world of mind and emotions, angst, existential crisis and depression. The movie succeeds mainly from its sheer brilliance in writing which successfully communicates, without compromising on an iota of entertainment value, the nature of every emotion,their behavioural outcomes, their utility and prominence in the larger scheme of our lives, the need to accept all of them as well as the need to strive towards a balance among them. Multiple abstract concepts which one would normally associate with psychology texts and self-help books such as formation of memories, transfer into and storage of long term memories, imagination, nostalgia, dreams, influence of emotions on memory, emotion - behaviour connect, loss of unused memory, repression, fears that fester in the subconscious, need for a balanced emotional state are presented through inventive and imaginative visuals in a sincere and heart warming manner.<br/><br/>
Pixar has done what it does best.. Outdo Pixar.. in making the BEST animated features ever. This is an abundantly funny, yet, subtle, sensitive, profound and poignant movie that presents its inherently complex and abstract material in a lucid manner that appeals universally. It is a veritable treat which would satiate the appetite of every demographic one could imagine, effortlessly making each of them laugh and cry. Inside Out is a triumph in movie-making and am certain that it would find its place in the coveted club of everlasting classics in movie history.<br/><br/>If there could be ONLY one movie that one would see this whole year...

","Inside Out is a film clearly made with honourable intentions to portray the complexities of the human personality. The fundamental problem is that the film simply tries to pack in too many aspects; memory balls, memory islands, core memories, abstract thoughts, reality distortion filter, imaginary friends and characters representing different emotions. The overall effect is like an orchestra without a conductor all playing at the same time and between them drowning out all the good bits.<br/><br/>Its a real shame as the family dynamic is cleverly constructed and the Riley character is a sweet engaging girl. Her struggles are the emotional core of the film but she is almost a supporting character in her own movie. The middle part of the films simply drags and overall the film really needed more of her and less of the cacophony of her noisy thought elements. The ending redeems the film and is a brilliant piece of film making, combining human fragility with the power of healing.<br/><br/>Overall a classic example of Hollywood creative talents over thinking and over compensating an idea which needed a much simpler delivery."

","I was really excited when I first saw trailer for that movie. Colorful characters got my attention and I was ready to watch it in Local Cinema. Main characters' casts are Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Ivana Wong as the emotions and Kaitlyn Dias as Riley.
Story starts from Riley's early ages of chilhood and how her emotions inside her head started their work. Complexity of emotions' work is explained and shown while main character, little and happy girl, is growing. Riley is rose by very responsible and good parents, but then some problems appear as she becomes a teenager. It is widely known that teenagers have complex mind and that movie shows how Riley is going through this time.
The movie itself is good directed and is full of colors. Every detail about chararistics is well-developed and clearly shown. Not only do people have emotions, but characters known as Emotions also do. Effects and backround sounds appeal viewers who loves to watch something with 'happy end'.
Movie is appropriate to watch with Family or alone - movie makes to feel warm feelings and helps to relax and fully penetrate to the reality of ""Inside Out""."

","Disney Pixar generally delivers creative, meaningful films full of vibrant visuals and fun song. ""Inside Out,"" while no doubt a very clever pitch for a film, is as strange as animated films come. The whole premise of this film feels off, even for an animated movie. Animation is nice because there are no limits to what you can do, but that's also its issue. ""Inside Out"" gets carried away and has a weird story that gets too sappy. I can't see children understanding or enjoying this film, it sort of feels like a Pixar film for adults. Pixar should have done a different film that was as good as classics like ""Up"" and ""Finding Nemo"" instead of this nonsense."

","This is a kid's version of ""Herman's Head."" The target audience appears to be all those 9-11 year old MENSA kids out there.<br/><br/>The film looks at 5 emotions in Riley's head from birth through a trying time at age 11. They discuss various aspects of the inner workings of the mind, many of which will go over the head of the target audience. I felt the film concentrated too much on silly nonsense going on within the brain at the expense of Riley's life.<br/><br/>I loved Anger, voiced by Lewis Black the angry comic. It was very fitting. However, they missed opportunities for other voices. Isn't Taylor Swift the voice of teen angst? They could have turned this into a classic with the right voices."

All the ""characters"" in this film were stereotypes and you could see how this film was going to play out 30 min in. The animation and environments were good and fun to look at but thats all they were, pretty. So I do agree it's a good kids movie but that does not mean its a good film."

","Plot - This movie is very predictable. This concept has been done before, and the overall story is very formulaic. Yes, its great for a kids' movie, but as a movie it isn't as great as it could've been. There are a lot of very dumb and contradictory plot devices that could've been handled better *cough* train of thought *cough*. <br/><br/>Animation - The animation is fantastic. I love all the detail and the way these different things are brought to life onscreen. There are a few things that probably could've been changed (for some reason the memories in the memory balls aren't from Riley's POV) but nothing that really ruins the movie. <br/><br/>Characters - I know that its the point that all the characters are as simplistic as possible, but it does make the movie a bit boring at times.<br/><br/>South Park - I don't know why, but this movie rips off Imaginaionland from South Park. They even call it that. Of course, the South Park version is much more entertaining and creative, but its clear that its a similar idea. Of all the things that this childrens' movie could rip off, that was unexpected. <br/><br/>Overall this is a kinda average kids movie with amazing animation. There are a lot of creative plot devices that aren't handled anywhere near as well as they could've been. This movie gets points for effort and an air of creativity. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. Its a bit funny and a bit sad (I guess). If you are young, have kids, or are easily entertained then I'd recommend this. If you are easily annoyed by predictable nonsense, then I'd recommend skipping this one."

","I enjoyed the movie. I couldn't imagine how they would make a whole movie from the point of view of the human emotions, but it came out well. And it was really funny movie,with a lot of laughter throughout the movie. I felt lot of emotional from the movie. And I understood lot of important things. This animation has an important message. It brings up family love, respect and never give up... One important truth that I noticed was that you can't have joy without sadness as well, so sadness was a main character for this reason. I found this to be an extremely creative and thought provoking film. The overall theme of family was important. At the begin of animation about grateful family. Father and mother both kind and loving to each other and the daughter. Suddenly, mind of daughter changes. Because her mind makes a trouble from inside out. Finally, Her mind understood most important thing of human life rules. The role of sadness as a vital emotion was really interesting. I liked that. I recommend it. It was very funny, sweet and a great overall family film."

"classicsoncall","7","0","4","12 November 2017"," ""Who is in charge of programming down there?""
","I've never seen this before on IMDb - the first nine comments on the 'Best' reviews are the very same ones that come up on the 'Hated It' page. They utilize the words worst, boring, overrated, very boring, terrible, leave the theater, over simplified, and missed the point to describe the picture.<br/><br/>So maybe there's some hope out there. My point being that the present day emphasis, especially on college campuses, seems to be about 'feelings' and a failure to effectively engage with reality. Anything considered negative is to be shunned or discriminated against, with alternative points of view to be banned outright. Sorry, but this leads to the next generation that can't effectively cope when things don't go their way. It's best exemplified in the movie when one of the characters proclaims ""Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!"" In my book, when everyone's a winner, no one is.<br/><br/>But the thing is, the picture is wrapped up in all these pretty colors and it's easy to get lost in the sentimentality that goes with Goofball, Friendship and Imagination Islands. I actually thought all those memory towers were pretty cool looking with the myriads of bright colored balls representing past events. There's even some creativity involved with things like the Train of Thought (going all over the place), and the Islands of Personality.<br/><br/>But over all, I didn't get a sense of a positive message coming out of this picture for young kids, which I presume is the target audience. Instead of learning how to cope in a new environment, Riley and her parents gave up and went back home to Minnesota instead of toughing it out for success in San Francisco. I guess they felt it was the right thing to do."

Now that film would have worked just as good as a live action movie, but it works as an animated film as well. It's very well-rounded, and one is easily able to sympathize with the characters. It never feels like there's anything wrong with it. The continuity is perfect.<br/><br/>Inside Out, on the other hand, has no such charm. The concept is simply ridiculous.

Pixar needs to go back to doing what it does best."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","0","18","22 December 2015"," A nice animated film, but pretty linear in storytelling
","Inside Out is a good animated film that was able to tackle a very difficult subject in a decent manner. The animation is nice, the characters are interesting, the jokes are pretty good... and yet... there is something missing from this film...<br/><br/>We'll get to that later.<br/><br/>Now, praise where it is due, Inside Out is a clever story about the emotions inside someone's head. All of the emotions control different aspects of the human (Riley) and they must work together to make sure everything is running A-OK. What is really good about this movie is that it directly shows that you can't simply be one emotion and be emotionally stable. To be emotionally stable, you need a full spectrum of emotions. However, the self-proclaimed leader is Joy. <br/><br/>Joy always wants to be happy and always wants to have fun. Any emotion that hinders Joy is seen as a nuisance (Sadness). Sadness is the polar opposite of Joy. She is slow, tired, and doesn't feel like doing anything. This obviously causes some conflict between the two and this is where our plot kicks into gear.<br/><br/>Long story short, Joy and Sadness fall out of the emotion control center and must find their way back to it before everything collapses and Riley loses emotional control.<br/><br/>While this seems like a good set-up, it suffers from some pretty glaring issues. The biggest issue is originality. Ironically, for as an interesting premise as this is, Inside Out is pretty predictable and doesn't have many twists and turns. To make things worse, it follows a VERY similar premise to Wreck-It Ralph.<br/><br/>Two figures lost in an abstract world full of glitches and bugs.<br/><br/>They need to get back to their own game/center before everything falls apart.<br/><br/>They are met by a strange character who is an outcast/glitch in the abstract world they live in.<br/><br/>The color palette is VERY similar.<br/><br/>Even the gags are similar in taste.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of difference between the two movies (the tasks are different), but the amount of visual similarities and plot similarities is a little odd. And as I said, this becomes a problem because the movie feels very similar to a lot of other Pixar films. Heck, the ending has dialogue almost EXACTLY the same as that of The Incredibles. <br/><br/>Aside from similarities to other films, how does the plot hold? It's good. Not fantastic, but it is good. I think the biggest issue with the movie (and movies like Osmosis Jones or other ""Inside"" movies) is that the stakes are realistically low. All that is really happening is this movie is that a girl is upset and doesn't know how to handle emotions. To me, this isn't a big deal, and is never will be a big deal unless it tackles a BIG ISSUE with emotions. The movie only tackles the basic issues with emotions, but it doesn't really go the extra-mile to say anything incredibly profound.<br/><br/>That being said, how do the characters hold-up? Good characters can save a mediocre-plot. Well, they are good... all two/three of them. This is a movie where MORE character interaction and development was needed. Joy and Sadness definitely interact with each other, but I never felt like there was a lot of connection between the two until the end. Granted, they both had their moments, but it never felt enough. If the movie has 5 emotions and only 2 of them get any attention, then they need to be complex and have a lot to say... but they don't. An extra character joins along (Bing Bong) who is Riley's imaginary friend. While an interesting character, he doesn't really do much other than work as a device to save Joy from death.<br/><br/>All in all, I could go on and on about the nitpicks and issues I had with the movie. Was it perfect? No. Was it good? Yeah. I'm glad I saw it. It had heart, the soundtrack was nice, there were some really good jokes, and it was entertaining. Is this movie a masterpiece by any means? Not really.<br/><br/>Check it out for yourself."
"kdavies-69347","7","0","17","25 November 2015"," A cute family movie, smart in many ways.
","I saw Inside Out twice now, once at the theater and once at home, and I've learned to appreciate it on a couple of levels.<br/><br/>First, just as a kids movie, it's pretty great. It has a simple enough plot for the family to enjoy, with lots of cute moments and jokes. Kids will love it obviously for the characters, and adults can get into the themes behind the action as well. The importance of family, spending time together, learning to deal with problems as a unit are all part of the story line as well. I think it's one of those films that families appreciate for keeping a lighthearted approach to difficult family topics, and some downright emotional moments that Pixar so excels at. So I think it deserves high praise. It's silly, but it's a smart kind of silly.<br/><br/>Secondly, is how the plot, characters, and events all follow a theme of psychology. I was surprised at how many terms I had heard previously in my university classes. Short term, and long term memory storage, abstract thought and reasoning, and how people form their personality around core childhood memories. I was surprised at how well the story was blended together with that of our own minds and reflections. You have to wonder what goes on in your own mind, when you loose interest in lets say... a hobby, or a relationship, or grow apart from family as well.<br/><br/>As Riley progresses through a major life change, she also follows some very specific stages of loss as well. I was caught up when I was noting the small changes in her personality as she hits different stages. Isolation at school, anger at home with her family, depression, and acceptance. Anyways, it was really interesting to catch those terms of the stages she goes through during the movie. I'm sure there are lot's more for the psychologists out there.<br/><br/>So without giving away too much, this is a great addition to the Pixar repertoire. Fun for everyone.<br/><br/>7/10"
"muhammedchand5","7","0","18","18 November 2015"," Soo much potential
","I honestly can't believe how much wasted potential this movie has. The trailer did however give a hint to it admittedly because just watching the trailer I thought well this looks very much like a kids movie. Now don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with that, I did of course realize that this was Pixar and naturally I expected a lot more. <br/><br/>To a large degree though the trailer actually hyped me up immensely and from it I got the impression that Riley would be the main character and the emotions would serve as the comic relief- they would bounce of and exaggerate what she felt just growing up and to be honest thats the direction I was hoping this movie would go. That it would show her growing, show her reactions to love and depression and confusion and watch as her emotions literally and figuratively mature. Instead it turns into a fetch quest. A fetch quest with a major plot-hole that even watching the movie for the first time was obvious. I'm sure it's been mentioned but they did have an actual tube that would actually transport the memories directly to the control center! The fetch quest really took away the main feature of this film- the emotions. Firstly they separated them so we didn't get to see interactions between all the emotions throughout the time Joy and Sadness were taken out. Secondly the emotions were now the main characters and the story could then be placed in literally any context. We have to get something important and take that important thing to a place or horrible things will happen...Additionally it opened up other room for wondering do the emotions then have feelings if Joy can be sad/upset and Sadness can be happy? <br/><br/>To it's credit it did a decent job of getting it;s message in the chosen time period of Riley's life across quite well. It dealt quite effectively with depression and I'm sure at that if I was at that age the movie may have resonated a lot better with me and even more so if the kid watching it was dealing with those emotions. It's a good movie no doubt but in my opinion for the potential it had, making the story into a generic fetch quest really really removed the massive amount of potential this movie could've had had it not been aimed towards a certain demographic."
"when_pigsfly-90672","10","0","22","12 November 2015"," My empathy for Riley is strong
","I love what Disney-Pixar did with this movie, the animation was just astounding. I really struggled when things got tough, emotionally, for Riley, as I have been in the exact same position before; moving to a new country when I was 14. <br/><br/>I joined Riley as she started off excited at the prospect of adventure. Then the fact that she was so far away from home really kicked in, and sadness and fear emerged. Trying to stay happy and positive, we join Riley on her first day at the new school. Disaster. The tough process of fitting commences, and a sense of isolation begins. With Joy and Sadness M.I.A, Riley becomes despondent, and the longer she feels empty for, the angrier she becomes. It reaches a point, where Riley, and myself, feel we would never be happy again. All we had was fear, anger, disgust, and running away from home wasn't out of the question. <br/><br/>Inside Out struck a chord inside me, as I'm sure it did for others. I have no doubt that there is a moment, somewhere, that resonates for everyone in this film. It shows that as much as we try to be strong and appear happy, sometimes you need to let those tears out to get past the sadness and move forward. That although those past memories may be tinged with nostalgic longing, they were one of your happiest moments at the time; something to cherish, taking good with the bad.<br/><br/>Highly recommend watching this movie, at least once."
"apgraybill","7","0","18","4 November 2015"," Not as great as it could have been
","Let me start by saying I am the queen of animated movies. My husband and I adore them (pretty much why I married the guy) and we rarely see movies in theaters so I'm extremely glad we waited for it to come out on DVD...because we were kinda let down by this one! I was so excited to see it, and maybe that was my own fault for having high expectations...but by no means did I NOT enjoy it, I just thought they could have done it wayy better.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie was seriously lacking in comedy. Half the reason why we love animated movies so much is cuz they usually make us laugh! Think Big Hero 6...DYING! And for a movie that has Lewis Black and Amy Poehler, it should have been littered with comedy gold. I think we chuckled, at best, about 4 times. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it has all the feels...I was crying throughout the entire film. Not in a depressing way, but they definitely address emotional stages anyone that's had a traumatic event will immediately recognize and relate to. Having just gone through some pretty traumatic events in the past few weeks and diagnosed with PTSD because of it, my tear ducts were ready for battle. <br/><br/>Also, like some people stated, I feel like there are way more emotions than just those 5. I also didn't feel like disgust was truly an emotion...more of an opinion. But Disgust was actually the character I liked best, in the end. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I didn't outright dislike the movie by any means...I would totally watch it again, but it's not even close to my top favorites. Pixar has done way better and I hope they come out with a second one (one that addresses puberty, maybe?) and improve on themselves."

The 'lead' emotions ,Joy and Sadness,were pretty annoying. But i liked the other 3 and wanted to see more of them but instead i got a very boring and slow adventure with Joy and Sadness. It was the worst part of the movie and it left like filler. The whole time when they were about to go back something occurred and were stuck there, again and again. It's predictable and annoying. But I liked the sacrifice of Bing Bong, that was an unexpected and emotional scene and it kinda waked me up after the boring scenes<br/><br/>The other parts of the film, were actually pretty good. The beginning with the whole explanation was nice and interesting and everything made sense. The ending were Rikey decides to walk away was also exciting, but for me it didn't make any sense because, where did she wanted to go?

"khemass","8","0","18","12 August 2015"," Interesting but not deep enough
","This is not a film for little kids. I would recommend it for 10 years old up with a lot of guidance from parents on what this film is about. It would be a good lesson for 10+ kids about human emotions and what they can do to us. But you got to watch the film first, and explain to them, before they watch it or while they're watching it. <br/><br/>As an animation, I think this film is average on the quality to entertain. Yes, it's fun to watch and I enjoyed it alright, but it didn't leave much impression on me. Just average fun like a fine animation film should be. I wouldn't say it's boring, but I wouldn't say it's extremely entertaining, either. <br/><br/>As for the theme or the message of the story, or what it tries to communicate to the audience. I would say that the film has both good and bad points.<br/><br/>I really appreciate the effort of trying to put these abstract psychological ideas of human emotion into something fun and tangible. It's refreshing to see something new and it's good for people to learn how their emotion can take control of them and how experience of life can affect our memory. It's good to see how they portray good memory of early childhood and how loving parents can create that for their child. <br/><br/>There are many ideas that I like in this film. I particularly like the idea that ""Sadness"" can actually make us turn some happy memory into sad memory, but sometimes it is important to express our sadness so that we can understand ourselves and other people understand us. I agree that sometimes anger, sadness, and fear can have positive use if you know when to use them. I agree that it is absolutely scary when we are blocked from our emotions, when we are numb and can't feel a thing at all. (like in that scene when the control center stops working)<br/><br/>However, when you make such a deep subject into a movie, I'd rather suggest that you have to be careful and make sure that you deliver the right message. Are people totally controlled by emotions alone? Where is our ""free will""? We do have our higher self that can rise above emotion and make good use of them. I think it's important that a film like this to communicate this point, otherwise it would be like telling people that ""Oh well, we are under control of our emotions. We can't help it. We can do nothing about it. This is how human is."" In my opinion, human is capable of choosing right or wrong, although our emotions can have a lot of influence on that. Reiley doesn't have to act like a little brat if she steps out of herself and see that her parents have it harder than her. Do imaginations and dreams have to be so pointless and illusive all the time? Sometimes they can contain something beyond what our brain is capable of. But this film makes it all look like they are all nonsense stuff.<br/><br/>In other words, if we get stuck to only what psychology books tell us, and we don't go deeper into spiritual side of our psycho, then it is very shallow. I wish that they will try to make Inside Out 2 or Inside Out 3 that will deal with all the deeper stuff, not just basic emotion psychology.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really appreciate that they create such a film, I just hope that they will somehow go deeper and deliver a more correct message."
