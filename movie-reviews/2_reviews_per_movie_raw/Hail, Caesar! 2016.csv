","The Coen Brothers are heroes of mine. They travel from universe to universe remaining true to themselves. Hail, Caesar should have been , I thought, a familiar universe for them but they seem lost. A journey without a clear destination. There are, of course, a few pleasures along the road. The scene between Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Finnes is a gem. Alden Ehrenreich is a breath of fresh air with vintage breezes that are exciting, compelling and totally disarming. The tap dance routine with Channing Tatum is also a lot of fun even if I can't quite get Channing Tatum. Great body and he can dance but he seems to be somewhere else. Impossible to connect on the screen with him. I hear he gets millions of dollars per movie so maybe it's just me. The opposite of George Clooney who launches himself body and soul to every moment he has on the screen. I will shut up now and wait for the next Coen Brothers movie."
"MartinHafer","7","34","43","6 August 2016"," Not a film for the average viewer.
","I was very surprised how quickly ""Hail, Caesar"" was in and out of the theaters...but now after seeing the film, I can completely understand why. It was as if the Coen Brothers simply said ""let's do a film for ourselves...who cares whether or not the public enjoys it or not!"". I appreciated it myself...but I am also not the average film-goer. As for the average viewer, the film makes allusions to many events in the history of Hollywood...but if you aren't aware of these events or rumors, you'll not understand or appreciate much of the film.<br/><br/>The story is based SLIGHT on the life of Eddie Mannix--a motion picture exec who was known as a 'fixer'--a guy who knew how to make bad problems do away...and with the bad behavior of many of the stars, this was an exhausting job. The story seems to be just a slice out of Eddie's life--possibly not the worst time as a fixer but a busy one. Through the course of the film, several problems arise--such as a pregnant single starlet and an actor of dabbles in communism. In each case, Mannix has to get to work to be sure the public never knows...and you see how exhausting this job is.<br/><br/>If you are looking for big laughs, you won't see them. There are a few small ones...just a few. Instead, it's more like a time machine trip to the early 1950s and you are that fly on the wall watching these Hollywood types as they go about their lives and doing stupid things. I do NOT strongly recommend the film but only mildly...and only if you are a real fan of the films of yesteryear AND are aware of the misbehaviors of some of our stars...or alleged misbehaviors."
"amountford","10","80","112","10 March 2016"," Hollywood: The opium of the masses...
","The heart in a heartless world? <br/><br/>I am surprised at the number of reviewers describing this film as a shallow and meaningless picture as, for me, Hail Caesar is both a very coherent and exceptionally valid critique of the influence of money on the art of film-making. Perhaps this is because I have significant problems with being bombarded by endless remakes and superhero films which offer nothing constructive beyond nostalgia, dreams and escape. Hail Caesar's clear message is that Hollywood both seeks to control its actors, the world around it, and the views of its consumers. <br/><br/>But then, is not my enjoyment of such a clever and well-thought out critique of Hollywood not both a negation (the dialectic!)of the film's central message and proof that meaningful and clever films are still being made (though perhaps the relatively poor box office takings and negative reviews are still proof)? These ambiguities are reflected in the film itself and any critical film-goer. The Coen's clearly profit from and are products of a Hollywood they lay bare in this film. Whats more, the tenderness and love they have for Hollywood is evident throughout the picture. This love/hate relationship is something which resonates with me strongly as I spend hours condemning blockbuster hits to those around me whilst spending my weekends going to watch blockbuster films. <br/><br/>Perhaps the negativity felt toward this film is on it being miss-sold (that's capitalism for you) as an uproariously funny slapstick film. It is far from laugh out loud funny and has a more consistently playful and sardonic tone. The film follows a day in the life of the 'fixer' Eddie Mannix who enforces the will of his never seen higher power (the executives.) As you follow his travels you are transported around the products of Hollywood (I am not overly familiar with the films they are critiquing) and experience the playful but ultimately meaningless creation of the major Hollywood staples of the time. <br/><br/>The story follows the kidnapping of the star of the companies big blockbuster - Hail Caesar. The depiction of Jesus Christs' life within the film is itself a reflection of Hollywood's attempts to subsume religion to its own power. In one excellent scene the representatives of the major religions sit slavishly before their master (Eddie Mannix) whilst engaging in some irrelevant theology but all ultimately agreeing that the motion picture is fine.<br/><br/>The communists who capture Hail Caesar's star are then introduced into the story. The pastiche of a bunch of old men in woolly jumpers sitting round and analysing the role of films within society and their own position as film-makers reflects perfectly the failure of Frankfurt School Marxist intellectuals (like Marcuse) who failed to connect with the masses. This is despite their cunning attempts to smuggle the communist message into Hollywood (a playful reference to the absurd McCarthyite hunt of the 1950s) and indeed their own success at converting the sincere star of Hail Caesar. The communist message is eloquently upheld by the star (perhaps it is powerful) who literally explains it to Mannix the enforcer who responds by slapping him down. Mannix himself is well aware of Hollywood's message and power as is shown by his decision to stick with Hollywood despite the offer of work from an aviation company involved in producing the H-bomb (showing that film and the ability to communicate dreams can be more powerful than fear.) <br/><br/>The film end's with the star building up a powerful narrative as he addresses Christ on the cross before stumbling into incoherence. This is the perfect metaphor for a film industry which produces plenty of verbose hype but communicates little of substance to its consumer (a la the Revenant!) Style over substance.<br/><br/>The negation of religion by film is then completed with Eddie Mannix walking off into the light and the film lingering on the Christian imagery of a Hollywood who now rules the minds of the masses. <br/><br/>Maybe I read too much into it but I thought this film was stunning, its many sardonic and eclectic scenes keep popping into my mind and I have been mulling over the film ever since. Maybe I shall follow this fare with a superhero film to escape into!"
"burlesonjesse5","7","21","26","11 February 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Hail, Caesar!
","Quirky and lingering, that's the Coen brothers way. And with a certain talent in every frame, Hail, Caesar! is a tribute to the movies or a tribute to their love of movies. Containing sumptuous period detail, a surplus of big-name stars, and behind-the-scenes accounts reminiscent of Robert Altman's The Player, ""Caesar"" goes back to the 1950's film industry with Joel and Ethan Coen as its unequivocal tour guides. They weren't alive when classical, Hollywood cinema was a mainstay. However, it feels like Minnesota's favorite sons were actually there, in a former life sort of speak. Their characters talk quickly, their characters smoke tons of cigarettes (in public places no less), and even legendary actor Danny Kaye is mentioned. Ah, the good old days.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite being semi-unfocused and somewhat erratic, Hail, Caesar! is expertly directed with every shot obtaining a level of film noir gleam. With its simplified diegesis, there is a little time to kill. The Coens give the audience halting scenes where actors show off an incredible skill set. All you gotta do is catch Alden Ehrenreich doing lasso work (with a plate of spaghetti and a rope) and Channing Tatum tap dancing his arse off. Amusing.<br/><br/>Harboring a budget of $22 million, set in 1951, and dealing with antagonists straight from the communist party, Hail, Caesar! tells the story of Eddie Mannix (an excellent Josh Brolin). He's the head of Capital Pictures and a quote unquote ""fixer"". He oversees the budgets and attitudes of movie stars as well as keeping their scandalous behaviors out of the press. When his biggest acting commodity (Baird Whitlock played by George Clooney) gets kidnapped and put up for ransom, Mannix has to come up with $100,000 just to smooth things over. Things to look for in Joel and Ethan's 100-minute opus: 1. cinematography of the highest order with Roger Deakins channeling residue a la Martin Scorsese's The Aviator. 2. a couple of neat sequences where Brolin's Eddie is watching dailies (to a film buff like me, that's interesting). 3. finally, Tilda Swinton plays twin, gossip columnists Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker. Fostering a ruthless and shallow demur, she makes today's media seem like child's play in comparison.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you're obsessed with cinema (I know I am), intrigued by the ins and outs of Hollywoodland lingo, and want to revel in the Coen brothers strutting their movie within a movie pedigree, then Hail, Caesar! will cure your wintry blues. All I gotta say is ""hail"" yes! Rating: 3 stars.<br/><br/>Of note: As mentioned earlier, tons of stars and Coen regulars inhabit little or almost no screen time via ""Caesar!"". It's as if they are doing a favor for their filmmaker buddies. Jonah Hill plays a surety agent for a production company, Frances McDormand plays a chain-smoking editor, Ralph Fiennes plays a patience-tested director, Scarlett Johansson plays an impregnated A-list actress, Dolph Lundgren plays a Soviet ""submarine commander"", and Clancy Brown plays a co-star of a flick starring the Clooney trouper. With so many notable faces, I thought I saw John Turturro popping up as an extra. If you happen to read this review, correct me if I'm wrong."

","I am a huge Coen Brothers Fan. Many of their films are hard core 10's in my ratings and I had an uneasy feeling going into this one. The trailer made me think of Intolerable Cruelty more than O Brother Where Art Thou or many of their other films.<br/><br/>It felt like a strung together series of little set pieces that didn't hang together as a whole. I won't mention the plot since there was virtually none and what there was was fairly flat and unimportant.<br/><br/>Normally the Brothers can overcome a weak plot (although strong plot-lines have driven several of their movies) with strong quirky performances and memorable cinematography.<br/><br/>Sadly, the dialog lacked snap, the film didn't pop off the screen looks wise, given that it's a period piece, and with such a strong cast, everyone looked tired - almost as if they had come in to film their parts after getting off their day jobs and they were just doing a favor to the Coen's.<br/><br/>Overall I've seen much worse but when you go to a Coen Brothers film, you just expect much more."

","It looks so good. Really, the feel of 1950s Hollywood has never been better, the photography is first rate with a stellar cast directed by the popular and very much held in esteem COEN BROTHERS. Trailer made it look like an fun Frank Capra kind of film. And when we walked out of it, given all the above, we missed something. A movie. There is none here. It is a great job made by talented people aplenty. It wants to be that fun film but never finds the movie. A few jokes. Not enough. Quirky fun characters, but not weird enough. Sublots aplenty, but they never run together and never are resolved. Good acting that goes nowhere. This fine film is just a bunch of dead end streets that are way too short with really interesting stuff on the side of the road but no intersection.<br/><br/>Neil Simon was given script advice once that all the characters have to meet in the play AT LEAST ONCE. Here, none meet at all. They have the subplot and that is it. Ending was weak too. Meh."
"info-12388","8","269","416","6 February 2016"," Not for everyone, and maybe that's a good thing...
","HAIL CAESAR! (""A Story of the Christ"", as we are told in the title card) is one of those offbeat gems that I have no doubt grows in affection with repeated viewings. Folks here complain that it's not a laugh-a-minute farce, that it's not this, that it's not that...<br/><br/>Here's what it *is*: the film version of RADIO DAYS. <br/><br/>Just like Allen made a loving pastiche of radio at its height in the 1940s, so have the Coens done for film at the tail end of its Silver Screen era, when studios manipulated its contract players and worked the media to prevent the ""unfortunate"" aspects from being revealed to an audience that just wanted escapism fantasy. Josh Brolin is the tightly-wound studio ""head of physical production"", an enforcer who's being seduced by a potential job with Lockheed to oversee work on the atom bomb. Before he can come to a decision about whether or not take it, he has to deal with the sudden disappearance of the slightly disconnected-from-reality George Clooney (who looks like he's having a blast in this, especially in the final scene of his big budget sword-and-sandel Jesus epic). Along the way, we see the Coens' take on Esther Williams, Carmen Miranda, Gene Kelly, and a host of other stars from the era...<br/><br/>... and this is what makes the film so damn much fun. It's not about the story, it's about how the Coens are celebrating the films we have perhaps idealized a bit too much: Esther Williams' underwater ballets and Gene Kelly in NYC for 24 hours and Gary Cooper trying to play it in a toney, high-class period drama. There are so many references to the great films of the day that if you blink, you'll miss a few — they follow fast and furious and sometimes with little more than a sly wink. If you are an old time movie buff, you will love this film to tiny little bits. If not... well, you probably wont enjoy it all that much.<br/><br/>But then the Coens probably didn't make it for you, did they..."
"HelenMary","5","9","10","3 April 2016"," Not as good as I hoped but amusing
","You see trailers for Hail, Caesar! and you expect lots of 1950s high jinx on set during the last decade of the glory days of the Studio System. Lots of homages and nods to real Hollywood actors. Clooney plays the main actor cast in the film within film of the Crucifixion (good for Easter release) and the centurion at the base of the cross who says ""surely this man in the Son of God"" etc. Brolin plays the Studio Fixer who dances around Press, covers up scandal and sees that everything runs smoothly. Clooney gets kidnapped. Channing does some entertaining Gene-Kelly-esque ""there are no dames"" songs whilst looking like he has painted on cheekbones, cameos all over the place. Cohen Brothers' films are generally brilliant, and this is funny, but it's not as good as was expected. The laughs get tired, the film is a bit too long and when you emerge from the cinema you think, ""what was that really about?"" The film is a weaving of small plots which are good viewing but are shallow. I expected more than the communist subplot and the confessional bookends of story underlining generally good guy in a challenging world. For all the stars, and kudos, it's disappointing and if it wasn't for the stellar cast, or the writer's status, I don't think this would have made it to the cinema... Funny, and a good date night film."
"geoaar-1","6","45","64","14 February 2016"," Wonderfully crafted but wanting on storyline
","Let me start out by saying that I'm a dedicated Coen Brothers fan. I love their sense of humor and the high standards they cling to in filmmaking.<br/><br/>That being said, I think they should have brought more story to this effort. The production values, the sets, the props, the overall look, and dialog are just about as close to perfect as human beings can get. Every scene is just about flawless. And there's lots of chuckles and wonderful parodies of old time Hollywood films. The Esther Williams/synchronized swimming bit and the Gene Kellyesque barroom dance number were just magic. You'd swear Busby Berkeley was reincarnated for the choreography. But that's what you get for the price of admission. The little bit of story is hardly relevant to the rest of the film. Indeed, George Clooney's role could have been trimmed out in editing and the film would have been none the worse for wear.<br/><br/>So, go expecting a few really well-done parodies of old Hollywood musicals and a lot of inside jokes about Tinseltown gossip and fabulous production values. Just don't expect any story, cause there just ain't any."
"richard-1787","3","379","632","6 February 2016"," Disappointing
","This movie got an A rating in the Cleveland Plain Dealer from a film reviewer I have long respected, so I took advantage of a free late afternoon to go see it on the day it opened.<br/><br/>It's a shame the review was so positive, because it made my disappointment that much greater.<br/><br/>There is very little in this movie that is funny. (The audience I saw it with almost never laughed.) Most of the parodies are simplistic and flat and don't say anything clever about the subjects they are lampooning.<br/><br/>Take the extended water ballet sequence that is meant as a send-up of Esther Williams movies. The sequence itself looks like a poor man's version of one of the numbers in *Jupiter's Daughter*. Scarlett Johannson looks frightened all the while she's up in the air in that little basket, but not frightened enough to be funny. And then? Nothing. The number ends as it would in an Esther Williams movie, and there is unfunny dialogue with the swimming character concerning her pregnancy.<br/><br/>And so it goes throughout the movie. Things happen, but there is no followup. There are parodies of different types of movies popular in the 1940s and 50s, but the parodies aren't clever or insightful. George Clooney's character gets kidnapped by left-wing script writers, but those scenes don't tell us anything about the black-listed screenwriters of the era.<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews on here say the movie is terrible, some think this movie is the best thing since sliced cheese. It's neither extreme. It's just a largely flat comedy, with too few laughs."
"Mister8tch","9","198","322","6 February 2016"," A Day in the Life
","Lots of disappointing comments about how this movie does not live up to the Coen Brothers ""standard"" (I guess that means laugh-out-loud), is full of stars who get fleeting screen time, has no plot to speak of, no great villain or other dramatic concoction to keep up glued to our seats, etc., etc.<br/><br/>What it is is a funny ""day in the life"" story of the guy (Eddie Mannix--superbly played by Josh Brolin) who has to keep some kind of lid on the craziness that is the studio system of the late 40's/early 50's. Looked at from that character perspective, this is an examination of one man's struggle not only with the insanity of his star stable (Clooney/Johansson/Ehrenreich), but with the question the movie actually revolves around--will Eddie decide to stay, or will he go to Lockheed, who have offered him a job that will make him more money and get him home on time for dinner. The confessional scenes that bookend this movie allow us a fuller glimpse into why Eddie does what he does. <br/><br/>Brolin allows us to feel the conflict Eddie is experiencing, amidst the ever rising chaos around him (from a kidnapping, to a possible paternity suit, to having a cowboy actor take over the part in a drawing room comedy), to discover he actually likes what he does, and actually finds a sense of personal worth in handling the ever-escalating mess that is constantly pressing on him from all sides. <br/><br/>Brolin's performance is so tight, so controlled and so real, that he is able to carry that storyline with great vigor and compassion. The rest of the lunacy, from the underwater Ester Williams scenes, to the Gene Kelly dance spoof, to the cowboy (Ehrenreich absolutely adorable and on point) and Carmen Miranda get together, simply provides the backdrop. You don't need to know any of the Hollywood history to appreciate this film, other than to know that a good portion of movies, at that time, were not pot-boiling epics, or racy, foul-mouthed satires, but rather quiet movies about individual struggle. Brolin keeps that focus throughout this film, making the ending, just like the movies of the past, a very happy one.<br/><br/>A very pleasant, clever, and funny effort from the Brothers. Yes, a send-off, Valentine, if you will. I can see where people who have enshrined Lebowski as the litmus test for all Coen comedy movies moving forward would be disappointed. Fact is, the Brothers can play more than one note."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","49","73","7 March 2016"," Would that it were so simple
","In the Coen Brothers latest ""Hail Caesar"" we have exactly the same Hollywood-based mix of communist writers and Hedda Hopper-style gossip columnists as recently seem in ""Trumbo"": but the films could hardly be more different.<br/><br/>""Hail Caesar"" is the film within the film: the latest Victor Mature style 'God and Sandals' epic for Capitol Pictures, starring the megastar Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Trying to keep this movie on track - together with all the other movies being concurrently filmed - is tough no-nonsense fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). These other movies include an Esther William's style water ballet starring gal-in-trouble DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson); an Anchor's Aweigh-style musical starring Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum); and a pot-boiling drama featuring non- acting singing-cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich). <br/><br/>To add to Mannix's tension, Whitlock is drugged and kidnapped before the final climactic Crucifixion scene can be filmed. Who's behind the plot and why, and can Mannix restore order while keeping the story out of the eye of voracious journalist twins Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both Tilda Swinton)?<br/><br/>The film plays out as a series of loosely connected vignettes, some much more successful than others. Johansson's water ballet, and indeed her entire sub-plot, is all rather dull and irrelevant and in my opinion could happily have been ditched.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum however is a revelation as a song and dance man in a Gene Kelly tribute. His song and dance number was for me the best part of the film and I could watch this stuff all day: I would personally LOVE IT if someone would make a complete retro-feature film in this ilk. Watch out too for Christopher Lambert (""Highlander"") as his almost incomprehensible Swiss director.<br/><br/>Capturing the most attention though is young Ehrenreich as the upcoming star without a clue. Many of his scenes, especially those with classical director Laurence Laurentz (a brilliant Ralph Fiennes) are hilarious.<br/><br/>Popping up in cameos are Jonah Hill (as the fixer's well paid 'man to take the rap'); Frances McDormand (""Fargo"") as a dottie film editor who really shouldn't wear scarves; and Robert Picardo (""Star Trek Voyager"") as the Jewish representative in a contentious meeting of religious representatives discussing Christ's portrayal in the film (""So, a priest, a Protestant, a Greek Orthodox and a Jew walked into a studio..."").<br/><br/>Having last year enormously enjoyed the studio tour at Warner Brother's studios in LA (HIGHLY recommended if you can book ahead for when you are in town) it was great to see the studios making an actual film there again (as opposed to TV). Cinematographer Roger Deakin has great fun suffusing the studio and everything else with a 50's glow, an effect extending to the old 4:3 screen format (which I can see generating some ""my DVD is defective"" returns in a few months!)<br/><br/>Is it any good? I think it's fair to say that this is a 'Marmite' movie (which if you are non-British is a way of saying that the film will massively divide opinion). I've not seen as many people walk out of a film at the cinema in recent years. <br/><br/>I personally found it a light-hearted and nostalgic trip into a golden age of studio-management, show-casing again the comic gurning talents of Clooney (particularly prevalent in the scene where he gets slapped around a bit and which demonstrates his range - as if we needed reminding after ""The Descendants""). Brolin is great as the straight-guy Mannix and most of the rest of the cast add value, though Johansson seems Ill at ease with her role. I'm also afraid 2 x Swinton is not equal to 1 x Mirren in ""Trumbo"". But it is Alden Ehrenreich that is the real acting find of the film - a breakout role for him after more minor roles in films like ""Stoker"" and ""Blue Jasmine"". <br/><br/>This is not the best Coen brothers film, being patchy and spasmodic and, in places, rather too clever for its own good. I got the same feeling watching bits of this (for example, the writer's meeting scene) as I do in many Woody Allen films: that I am not politically / philosophically intelligent enough to understand the niceties of the script (and I'm considered quite bright!). This can be a bit alienating for an audience.<br/><br/>If I think back to all its numerous sub-parts it was often in 4-Fad+ territory.... but overall it's lack of cohesive story arc brings the overall confection down a notch or two.<br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks)."
"StevePulaski","4","282","478","5 February 2016"," Satire that lacks energy, conviction, characters, character development, a focus, and nearly everything that makes good satire
","After the phenomenal and emotional roller-coaster of ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" a film that still hasn't found the audience it so desperately deserves, Joel and Ethan Coen followup arguably their best film with one that might be their most forgettable. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a disappointment of epic proportions; an empty, unfocused satire on Hollywood business that has too many characters fighting for too little screen time, almost no energy despite attempting to work with a high-stakes plot, no strong character relationships despite the fact that everyone is trying to get a word in at all times during the course of the film, and finally, no central conflict that results in the characters ostensibly mustering up any kind of energy. If the characters themselves barely care about the situations they're in, why should we, the audience, who is now out of the high cost of a movie ticket? <br/><br/>The film revolves around a Hollywood mogul Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), who is hired to help fix the troubled production of a Hollywood epic known as ""Hail, Caesar!."" The film stars the famous Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), who winds up being drugged on-set and kidnapped by a radical group of communists that call themselves ""The Future."" Mannix is tasked with giving the group $100,000 in exchange for his star actor.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers spend much of the film hopscotching from different characters and different sets in what feels like a setup for a mini-series rather than a one-hundred minute film. Such characters are Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), a very meticulous director, Thora and Thessaly Tacker (both played by Tilda Swinton), rival, twin-sister gossip columnists, Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a low-rent Western actor-turned-movie-star, who is one of Mannix's closest clients, DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an actress who becomes pregnant out of wedlock in the middle of her film, and Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), a Gene Kelly-type actor, also working under the order of Mannix, who winds up at the center of the film's outstanding dance sequence between a group of Coast Guard members about to embark on a nautical mission that will prevent them from seeing a dame for months.<br/><br/>""Hail, Caesar!"" is a film of moments, meaning that, once the film is over, you'll remember certain scenes you enjoyed, certain actors' cameos (which most of the aforementioned are) you appreciated, and if you're lucky, lines you can quote verbatim. At the end of the day, the sporadic humor that those little moments provide is not enough to recommend a film. The Coen brothers don't seem to know what direction they want to take this film, and with such a concise runtime, they have no time to make good use of the actors they probably paid quite a bit to show up on set for one day. This gives the film the look and feel that most of these A-list stars are simply fighting over screen time, and that isn't funny, especially when you have true talent being only momentarily showcased so the film can dart off to the next decorated setpiece.<br/><br/>Then there's the issue of the film just not having much life to it outside of immaculate costume design and some strong cinematography (done by Roger Deakins, one of Hollywood's most masterful cinematographers working today). Because the actors aren't given characters to work with, no real energy or interest builds for them, and neither do character relationships. What we were supposed to gain from the scene involving Jonah Hill (who is on-screen for maybe a minute and a half) and Scarlet Johansson where Johansson's DeAnna asks Hill's Joseph if pressing down on the machine that stamps the papers hurts his forearm? Was this sort of flirtation so necessary that it needed to be included, or were the Coen's too busy giggling under their breath to notice? <br/><br/>""Hail, Caesar!"" is overpopulated with scenes that don't work to further what little plot is here, and with such a high-stakes story about a lead actor being kidnapped by a band of communists, Clooney's Braid Whitlock doesn't seem too phased, Brolin's Mannix, who has never been a particularly strong actor to show real emotion or gusto in his personals, doesn't seem too concerned, so what is there left for us to care about? <br/><br/>Some comparison has been made between both ""Hail, Caesar!"" and Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" and while the two have a similar approach to dry wit and deadpan humor, as well as similar actors like Fiennes and Swinton, Anderson's picture was a perfect example of copious energy and exhilarating, rapid-fire comic exchanges. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is the exact opposite; a frequently dull and almost entirely uninteresting film, predicated upon the strength of a few great scenes and some decent, albeit far, far too short, performances in a thoroughly muddled picture."

","From the previews of this film, I had a high level of anticipation for the Coen Brothers' latest venture, expecting it to be an hilarious and satiric romp through the halls of 50's Hollywood. The Coens are excellent technicians so the riffs on MGM, 50's Hollywood Stars, and the general machinations of the studio system were very well done. But I'm afraid the film's achievements were pretty much relegated to this dimension and overall the film remained in the category which I term ""All Style and No Substance,"" clever but ultimately delivering a thin story. Along the way there are some wonderful bits, especially Channing Tatum singing and tap dancing in a suggestively gay sailor dance routine, Tilda Swinton playing twin columnists, Alden Ehrenreich doing some hilarious cowboy stunts on a horse and with a lasso, and Ralph Fiennes directing in a sort of prissy manner. However, none of the plot lines ever yielded anything substantive. I found it difficult to figure out just what the Coen Brothers were attempting with this film."

Buster Scruggs was good for the most part. I hope they find their passion sooner than later."

","Listen closely. We don't have much time because the film snobs will start banging the NOT USEFUL button and this review will disappear into the IMDb ether.<br/><br/>This film almost makes you wonder if the Coen Bros are caught in some sort of Star Trek time paradox and are doing their films backwards. If they had started with this film 32 years ago, the critics would say there were some clever set-pieces and the cinematography was superb but the concept should never have been greenlighted and the script was wretched. From such humble beginnings, in 2016, the Coen Bros would then be able to deliver BLOOD SIMPLE and probably win multiple Oscars for their ""growth"" as film makers.<br/><br/>But in real time, 32 years after Blood Simple, this film is so bad that people were voting with their feet and leaving the theatre at the 1:00 mark (approximately). The story is awful, the dialog is awful, and the voice-over is bad enough to be used as a ""persuasion device"" at Gitmo.<br/><br/>George Clooney should get a new agent because there is not enough money on the planet to compensate him for having to wear a costume that makes him look fat and bloated and 20 years older than he actually is. Only Channing Tatum rescues his own dignity in a tribute to Gene Kelly that actually is entertaining and engaging.<br/><br/>The is an awful film. I have never lied to you before and I am not going to start now.<br/><br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/><br/>Addendum 2-26: Frankly when I penned the above review right after leaving the theatre, I was not expecting to get involved in a controversy about how flexible the Coen Brothers were ""cross-genres,"" or how clever and eclectic their fans need to be to appreciate the wonderfulness of this specific work. But since the controversy exists, I will add that generally the Coens have produced some of best films I have seen in my lifetime. Inside Llewyn Davis, for example, held my attention like glue, it was a polished gem. Most of their films are polished gems. Unfortunately this is not one of them. If you Google, you will find that, in spite of the sycophantic mainstream critics, this film has generated the Coens' worst box-office numbers ever. And that was the point I was trying to make. Viewers instinctively know the difference between a hit and miss. It's their job -- enjoying films is why they left home, endured the traffic, and found a parking spot in the first place. The actors here try hard, I agree, but the story and the script simply do not connect or resonate or form any empathic bond. The horror is that the ""brothers"" really should have known better."
"bankofmarquis","4","221","412","5 February 2016"," Hail No!
","HAIL, CAESAR! is one of the worst motion pictures that I have seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>There. That should get me on the poster.<br/><br/>A rare misfire by the usually reliable Coen Brothers, HAIL, CAESAR! had all the earmarks of a good film - veteran script writers and directors, a stellar cast and a good technical team. So why didn't this work?<br/><br/>Let's start with the marketing. By the previews and the television ads, this looked like a whimsical farce of a movie by the Coen Brothers. Call it ""Coen Brothers-lite"", in the same vein of BURN AFTER READING and O BROTHER, WHERE ARE THOU? It starred GEORGE CLOONEY as a major motion picture star of the '50s who is kidnapped by ""THE FUTURE"". It takes legendary Hollywood ""fixit man"", Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) to pull a band of Hollywood types together to find and rescue him.<br/><br/>But, that is not what the movie is about.<br/><br/>It does have a whimsical tone, I'll give them that, but that's about all that is the same from the previews. The movie isn't about Clooney's character, it's about a day in the life of Mannix and the many, many things he needs to fix. Clooney's kidnapping is just one of many stories/crisisis that Mannix needs to fix and, no, he doesn't incorporate the other stars to help out. They had their own problems.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is a refined director working with a less than refined actor (Alden Ehrenreich). Scarlett Johansson is an Esther Williams- type who is in ""the family way"" and Channing Tatum is...well, I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>I waited all movie for these disparate story lines to merge together, but they never did. They were just different short stories stitched together to form a movie.<br/><br/>That would be fine, because this movie stars a boatload of Hollywood celebrities, right? Well, not really...<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is in 2 scenes<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is in 3.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is in 3.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is in only 1 scene, but steals the movie.<br/><br/>Poor ol' Jonah Hill is just in 1 scene, and really, he is in only about 1/2 a scene.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton has the biggest part of these ""stars"", she plays twins who are rival gossip columnists that are each in 2 scenes, so she has 4!<br/><br/>Clooney, does have the largest of the small parts, but it still is just too little.<br/><br/>The other issue I have is that NONE of these characters (including, and maybe, ESPECIALLY, Mannix) have any kind of emotional arc. All characters are basically the same at the end that they were at the beginning. There really were no ""stakes"" for anyone, which makes for a dull movie.<br/><br/>To give the Coen's credit, the move is ""made"" well. Beautiful shots, the costumes and sets give off the proper vibe, so it's not a sloppy or shoddily made movie, it's just not a good movie. They only have 2 people to blame, the writers, which, of course, is themselves. <br/><br/>If you want to see a good picture about 1950's era Hollywood, check out TRUMBO.<br/><br/>HAIL, CAESAR!? HAIL, NO!<br/><br/>4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","My cohort fell asleep during Hail, Caesar!. Sure, it was a late showing, but I am sure in theaters around the country people are nodding off or walking out of this one. Let them. Caesar! barely has a discernible plot, profound themes, or even a convenient ah-ha moment. But we should be used to this by now, this is typical Cohen brothers' affair. Caesar! is a waltz with insanity, sacrificing many crutches that helps audiences engage. This film will not garner popular approval, but it is still an accomplishment.<br/><br/>If there is a plot in Hail! Caesar, Eddie Mannix is certainly at its center. This Catholic studio head must right the ship or face catastrophe. The film is a 48 hour window of insight into a Hollywood studio, the setting for Mannix's everyday mad life. What he experiences is basically a relentless barrage of vignettes and personalities. There is a western, musicals, a costume drama, and of course the historical epic itself. Each has its style, director, crew, and most importantly its stars. The sheer density of material is somewhat overwhelming. All display are equally elaborate, including the cast, which is recognizable down to the bit parts. This is one of the best ensemble performances in recent memory. Tatum and McDormand are my personal favorite parts, but all are enjoyable. Additionally, I would bet this is the first Oscar candidate for cinematography. What will disappoint some audiences is the lack of follow up or exploration. Ideas and themes are introduced and later simply hinted at. Premium cameos are often utilized just once, lucky characters thrice at best. Some may think parody requires more extensive analysis. However, Hail! Caesar is ripe with commentary, it just never stops to take a breath. The humor is not rooted in scrutiny, rather in the absurdism and frantic pace. This style does not even prevent momentary poignancy. Hail! Caesar's climax is a parody of sappy overwrought moments of clarity, but there is a sense of a genuine moral, a true stance on faith, movies, and reality. I will certainly rewatch this film again. Remember, The Big Lebowski was not a hit on arrival. I fear comparing the two, but I feel both were smarter, more extensive, and subtly funny in ways not obviously apparent. I might just be trying too hard to hawk this movie in order to convince myself, but I sincerely think it is worth a viewing for those who have previously appreciated the Cohen Brothers body of works."

","Clooney has the uncanny ability to become associated with awful movies. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a mess that smacks of five guys plotting over dinner how to make some spending money.<br/><br/>Let's tick off what's good, that's easy and quick: Crystal clear photography (a Coen trademark), and interesting sets & costumes. The bad & ugly are endless.<br/><br/>The few laughs are strained and forever in coming. The movie is less than two hours but it seems endless with dialogue that just drags, scenes that last forever with no point, and actors who listlessly read their lines - FOR REAL, NOT JUST FOR THE SARCASM. There is no plot, no point, no meaningful conclusion to the stitched together vignettes.<br/><br/>Spoof I understand. ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"" is a spoof, a parody. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a spoof of audiences stupid enough to cough up their money and time.<br/><br/>This movie seems to be appealing to a narrow band of reviewers and critics knowledgeable of Hollywood's Golden Age, with some pointing out how stupid the rest of us are for not understanding. That's nice. It doesn't work on any other level."

We were so surprised because it got great reviews (I seriously cannot imagine anyone finding a redeeming quality about this movie)... and because the cast is stellar we thought it would be a winner.

"framptonhollis","8","20","31","21 February 2016"," Very Entertaining and Enjoyable
","Sure, a lot of people hate this movie, and I get it, it isn't for everyone. Your enjoyment of the film solely depends on your sense of humor, expectations, and background knowledge of Hollywood films of this era.<br/><br/>I had read into this film a bit before I saw it, and therefore my expectations were pretty much surpassed. I already knew that there wasn't going to be much plot and that a lot of the big name actors and actresses in the film were in it very little. But, no matter how negative some of the criticism I heard, I still eagerly wanted to see it. And I did see it, and I loved it!<br/><br/>One of the main reasons why I enjoyed it so much was because of my previous information of classic filmmaking. I knew plenty about classic epic, musical, and western cinema, and there's plenty of nods to various filmmaking techniques of that era that I noticed. A lot of this film kind of feels like it was made back in the 50s, so I have to give credit to the Coen brothers for that.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was how little screen time various actors got. Many of the people who were top billed are barely in the film at all. I mean, Jonah Hill is literally on the POSTER and yet he was in the film for hardly even a minute! Couldn't his part have been a bit longer? Or maybe he simply shouldn't have been on the movie's poster! Other actors/actresses were in it disappointingly little to, such as Scarlett Johansson, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, etc. However short their appearances may be, all of the performances are extraordinarily well done, which is why I wanted to see more of these actors in the first place!<br/><br/>Other flaws I found were rather minor. Certain gags went on a little too long, although pretty much all of the gags worked very well for a remainder of their existence. There also isn't much of a plot for a lot of the film. While there is SOMETHING resembling a plot, there was very little of it. Of course, normally in a film (unless it is experimental or a documentary), I like a bit of plot and conflict, and in ""Hail, Caesar!"" there wasn't as much of it as the trailer may want you to believe. But, the film didn't really need much of a plot to keep me hooked and entertained.<br/><br/>There certainly were more positives than negatives from my point of view. When a gag in the film worked, it worked extremely well. And the entire film is shot beautifully as well! <br/><br/>There's plenty of entertainment value to be had. There's a bit of comedy, mystery, music, and even some elements of drama. I enjoyed ""Hail, Caesar!"" quite a bit, and look forward to seeing it once again in the near future! While there are a few problems, all the positives make up for them really well! This is a great satire that I'd recommend to people who really appreciate older films, have a somewhat dark sense of humor, and don't mind a film with very little plot"

","EXTREMELY awful, It was unfunny , boring and completely lacked character. None of the characters were memorable like in other Coen films. The plot was awful and it is very lacklustre , the Coen brothers should be ashamed of themselves.

SIX ! the worst film of 2016 so far. I felt that it is the Coen bros weakest film. There is one good thing. Channing Tatum's musical number, is very catchy and well performed but other than that its just a mixture of unfunny moments being held together with a piece of rotten string."
"billkincaid","2","28","46","7 February 2016"," Did they leave in the ""Deleted Scenes""?
","Plays like a rough cut. There are some truly fun moments - the cowboy movies, the sailor dance, but there are also many scenes that are almost lifeless. And that's the problem. In between these fun moments, the audience quiets down and starts looking around the theater to see if anyone else is getting that same ""uh oh, we should have waited for this to come out on Netflix"" feeling. <br/><br/>Some of the more positive reviews sound like essays from a community college film class. Quite a few of the positive reviewers have alleged ""true"" Coen fans will love it - hence if you don't love this movie, it's because you should be somewhere more suited for unsophisticated people, such as a wrestling match or Adam Sandler film festival. I'm not sure what irritates me more, the faux elitism or the $10.50 I paid for the ticket. This isn't a case of ""some people just don't get this movie"". The Coens have never been in that stratospheric league of art house filmmakers whose work only appeals to some lofty intellectual upper class. It's a ""movie movie"", aimed at people who appreciate movies perhaps a bit more than some, perhaps, but still at the mainstream. This movie fails to deliver a coherent, engaging story to its intended audience. <br/><br/>Cut out the confessional scenes, cut out the Lockheed subplot, cut back on the scenes with Ralph Fiennes, trim the scenes at the Malibu House and pare back Clooney's role (unless you can actually have him do something interesting). These can go on the DVD as ""Deleted Scenes"", because they already play like those.<br/><br/>Expand the story with Jonah Hill and Scarlett Johansson, because that could have been funny and sweet instead of an off-screen nothing. Add a climactic chase between the cowboy star and Channing Tatum, each using their already-established skills, through the studio, passing through and riotously disrupting several movie sets. <br/><br/>It is visually lovely, but moves slowly on its way to nowhere."
"blanketman77","7","30","50","4 February 2016"," Not one of the Coens' better films
","Caught this at a screening the other night, and wasn't very impressed. The laughs are infrequent, and it's downright boring in stretches. It does have its moments, though: My favorite was Brolin trying to get reassurance from an array of religious leaders that his new biblical epic won't offend anyone. And Ehrenreich, who I'd never heard of, was great as the clueless but sincere rodeo expert who has somehow fallen into serious act-ting... much to Ralph Fiennes' chagrin. Who knew a line like ""if only it were so simple?"" could generate such hilarity? Such moments are few and far between, though.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a C+ flick - I think it's getting over-rated by critics just cuz of the Coens' name. It's one of their weaker efforts."

It is the most artless film ever made and everyone who went to see it deserves a refund. The actors-- Clooney, Fiennes, Johanssan were terrible to watch but how did Josh Brolin get into this chaos of a somewhat expensive chaotic senseless film.

"jennyssparking","2","26","43","10 February 2016"," Mind-numbing
","I walked out of this movie after an hour. I only lasted as long as I did because I kept waiting for some kind of plot or for something interesting to focus on besides set design and costumes (which were excellent). It is possible that this movie picks up after an hour, but given that it was impossible for me to take any more after the first 60 minutes, I can't imagine that would make much difference. This is a movie where things just happen. Something will happen with some people in a scene that will remind you of some classic movie. Then something else will happen unrelated to the last scene with DIFFERENT people that will remind you of a different classic movie. This continues for an hour (and possibly the whole movie but I couldn't take any more). A lot of the movie suffers from deliberate horrible acting and painful overacting by the actors in order to reference the ""period"" style of acting in old movies. Basically, heaven help you if you aren't rabidly in love with classic (Gene Kelly classic, there is actual tap dancing) Hollywood and go see this movie. I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 because the costuming/set design was so great."
"jimbo-53-186511","1","20","32","10 February 2017"," The Coen Brothers hit a new low
","I won't bother with a plot summary for this film for the simple reason that it doesn't seem to have a plot. With that being said, let's crack on with the review.<br/><br/>Before I start, I would like to say that I am neither a Coen brothers' fan boy nor am I a staunch hater of the brothers. In fact, I've found my attitude mixed towards the brothers when it comes to their films, but it's safe to say that this is easily the worst film of theirs that I have seen thus far...<br/><br/>So what exactly is going on here? Are the Coen brothers poking fun at greedy film directors, producers and/or film makers? Are they also laughing at the fact that a big shot 'studio fixer' would go to pieces when a 'low-rent' alcoholic actor is kidnapped and held to ransom by a bunch of Communists? This sort of satire was covered in a similar vein (and just as badly) in Birdman 2 years ago and whilst I appreciate what the Coen brothers are trying to do here it can only be considered a monumental failure.<br/><br/>I think the problem with this film is that the Coens try to cram too much into the film which results in the film having no real focus; you have Clooney's character being kidnapped, a sub-plot about Scarlett Johansson's character being pregnant, a bad actor Hobie Doyle getting more recognition than he deserves. This all leads to a rather messy screenplay and sadly, in this case, it's a film with several stories, but with none of the stories being remotely interesting.<br/><br/>The best part of this film was actually the bit where all the sailors were singing and dancing, but to be fair even that section of the film was overdone and went on for too long.<br/><br/>In my book, this film is a technical success - It's well-edited, and the acting is excellent by everyone involved - the Coen's really couldn't have assembled a better cast. It's a shame that their writing is so weak, the film is unbelievably boring and even their dialogue (which is usually pretty good) is rather sub-standard and ultimately it is these things that really ruin the film."
"zetes","9","73","138","7 February 2016"," Second tier Coens still equals a great movie
","Maybe not one of the Coens' masterpieces, but easily in their second tier, which means it's great. It depicts a day in the life of a Hollywood studios in the 1950s, with Josh Brolin as the studio head whose job it is to keep things running smoothly. The main plot revolves around the kidnapping of the star of the studio's gigantic Biblical epic, Hail, Caesar!, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Several other movie stars play parts on the sidelines, including Scarlett Johansson as an Esther Williams-type swimming musical star, Channing Tatum as another musical star, and Alden Ehrenreich as a Western star who has been transferred to a more sophisticated drama. Ehrenreich, despite being the least familiar actor among the cast, steals the show. There are tons of familiar faces in the film (Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Wayne Knight, Fisher Stevens, David Krumholtz, Frances MacDormand, Tilda Swinton - playing twins!) and many of them don't get more than a minute of screen time (Hill, for example - you've seen his entire performance in the trailer, and he made it onto the poster), but everyone's highly amusing. The plot might not amount to much, but it's all a lot of fun, and, as you would expect, wonderfully shot and directed."

"paulgwilliams","2","5","6","29 June 2016"," Rubbish
","I was amazed to find that this film was by the Coen brothers and starred George Clooney. It must be designed to appeal to a particular type of humour - nostalgic American with a fondness for underplayed slapstick. It's not for British audiences! At the showing I went to several people walked out before the end, and there was no laughter at any point. The plot is over-complicated, and much of the acting is stilted and poor - possibly deliberately though this is difficult to discern. Some scenes seem to have no purpose in relation to the storyline - a real hotchpotch of distractions. There is even a religious theme which instead of being funny may well give offence. Sorry, it's not worthy of the Coens or Clooney. Give it a miss."
"ChefHoobajoob","10","22","37","9 February 2016"," This movie is a) not what it seems and b) brilliant
","The Coens sometimes release movies that are immediately accessible, where everything you see is more or less all that there is to take away from it. True Grit, Fargo, Raising Arizona, Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, etc.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! isn't one of these immediately rewarding movies. It's one of the other kinds of movies they release where repeated viewings and some contemplation is involved because not all of what's going on is immediately accessible on your first exposure. There are multiple layers of interpretation at work simultaneously, making for a lot of meta- content. More like a puzzle that rings around in your brain long after you've seen it. Barton Fink, The Man Who Wasn't There, A Serious Man, etc.<br/><br/>Immediately after my first viewing, I was in the same boat with a lot of the reviews here, where I was convinced this is a Coen dud. Everything seemed to ramble around with no real connecting story to carry it through. My first reaction was: 'this sucks'. My complaint was that none of the on-screen action seemed very well connected at all to anything else. The trailer kind of created an impression of a comedic kidnapping thriller with some Hollywood tributes thrown in for candy, but that isn't the experience you get at all.<br/><br/>Instead I was left asking: why is so much time spent on the different movie-in-movie sequences? What does any of it have to do with the main character's story, except tangentially through his work for the studio? It just seemed like kind of a pointless pastiche of pseudo-tribute scenes with maybe some funny lines and Hollywood observations here and there.<br/><br/>But, these guys have been making movies forever. They don't just throw sh*t in for the hell of it and cross their fingers. Every scene and character has a function, and it's always related back to a central idea or theme.<br/><br/>Think of the Mike Yanagita character in Fargo - the weird scene where Marge goes to visit him in the restaurant and he goes all stalker-creepy on her and makes up a story about his dead wife. I puzzled over that scene long after seeing it the first time. But, of course, that scene and that character has a meaningful, significant function in the movie. Google 'what significance does mike yanagita have in fargo' if you're fuzzy on the details.<br/><br/>So, what's the unifying idea in ""Hail, Caesar!""? What is this thing about? My view is that this movie is exploring one central question: ""do our actions in life matter?"". Every story element is coming at that question, either seeking an answer, or trying to provide one: Mannix, the communists, religion, and movie makers.<br/><br/>To see this in action, and without including any spoilers, wipe your mind clear of previous judgments and opinions, and watch it again with fresh eyes and these questions in mind:<br/><br/>1. What problems is Mannix asked to fix?<br/><br/>2. Does he take 'direct action' to fix those problems?<br/><br/>3. What contribution does his action make to the solution (if there is one)?<br/><br/>4. Would the problem have 'solved itself' without his action?<br/><br/>5. Bonus question: why are Thora and Thessaly twins?<br/><br/>...if you watch this film and look for evidence of this central question, you will find it in every single scene. Every single character and line is contributing to the exploration of this question and the different answers. Watching the movie through this lens, I had a completely different experience, and found myself loving every minute of it. These riddles and rhymes are everywhere in the movie.<br/><br/>Do the Coen's try to answer the central question in the movie? Yes, they do.<br/><br/>Their answer is: 'were that it were so simple'<br/><br/>Or, said another way: 'it's complicated'"
"tigerfish50","1","41","75","20 February 2016"," Hail, Coenceit!
","Occasionally the Coen Brothers turn out films with a little substance, but these days it's mostly powder-puff satirical comedies. 'Hail Caesar' belongs firmly in the latter category, with its absurd tale of a lead actor kidnapped by a clique of Communist intellectuals from the set of a campy melodrama about Ancient Roman legionnaires. The studio's Mr Fix-It searches for his lost star while he pacifies the inflated egos of actors, directors and gossip columnists and negotiates with a potential new employer. After about twenty minutes, it becomes obvious the farcical story is just an excuse to serve up some pastiches of 1950s-era movie scenes being filmed on the lot.<br/><br/>The theatrical frolics combined with the half-baked mystery might produce a couple of weak chuckles, but little more. The plot is both fragmented and threadbare, the characters are all stereotypes, and their exchanges no more meaningful than Saturday Night Live skits. There are plenty of insider jokes and caricatures of movie-land personalities, but that's insufficient reason to spend ten seconds analyzing this self-satisfied trifle for subtexts. It's an unambitious, insulting mess, and a waste of everybody's time."

If it was supposed to be a Mystery, the mystery was so obvious and so stupid. The plot of kidnapping was humorous but how and where it ended was so unrealistic and boring. Oh and when those study group started talking, it felt like such a waste of time... It was my selection of the movie for the evening and all my friends said I will not be given another choice to select a movie in future!!! I think I will prefer that! Gosh!"

","If you're like me at all, you'll still be waiting for the film to begin when the closing credits role. On the plus side, you have an awful lot of stars who seem to be having fun. You have a glossy production and some elegantly slangy, period dialogue. What you don't have is pace of any kind, nor momentum, nor any honest idea of what the point is beyond lampooning/paying homage to old Hollywood. The themes, apart from Brolin's character as conflicted by a job offer, are hopelessly obtuse. Is it about communist writers seeking a new society? Swell, but this ignores the reality that many communist-affiliated screenwriters both earned high salaries and had no intention of destroying the system. OK, set that aside. There still remains muddle in a big way, as in lengthy recreations of period movie scenes that do not move the story whatsoever, nor go anywhere else, and defy era. What year is this? The adverts claim it's the 1950s but this is wholly irrational. In what year were Esther Williams-style swimming movies made along with singing cowboy films? MOST egregiously: in no Hollywood musical in which sailors sing and dance about a lack of women does the choreography involve them dry-humping one another. Not that I've seen, anyway. I also wonder in what universe Tatum deserves stardom, just as it is highly bizarre that a communist movie star would, in the midst of his career, leave for Moscow in a submarine. Ehrenbeich is, I admit, truly wonderful as the singing cowboy, but this alone cannot save a self-indulgent mess of a film. Coens, really, now."

I'm still not sure if it's meant to be a comedy or a satire. As a comedy it fails. A few of the lines are good but the humor is more clever than funny. As a satire it also fails. It's not biting enough to succeed. On the plus side it LOOKS good. The colors are strong and bright and the 1950s are recreated perfectly. All the acting is good too--especially by Brolin. There's also a long song and dance number that stops the movie. It has Channing Tatum and a bunch of guys dressed as sailors tap-dancing and singing (badly) and dancing. It's also VERY homoerotic. It has nothing to do with anything else in the movie but I'm not going to complain.

","This is another classic example of never judging a movie from its trailer. The trailer was so good and showed a lot of promise but the movie turned out to be a damp squib. The Coen brothers who have written some classics in the past seem to have an off day. There is so much potential in the story about the movie business in the 50s but too many characters and side plots ruin the film. There is a small bit of history added in about Communists in US in 1950s but that twist looks lame because the story is dull. Perhaps, the Coen brothers should take some inspiration from Tarantino who specialises in making films with multiple characters and side plots. What also made me upset is the Coens waste the talent of multiple actors starting from Clooney, Johansson, Fiennes, Hill, Mcdormand & Swinton who is a double role. They have all interesting characters but never remain sort of caricatures because of the poor writing. And finally coming to Josh Brolin. Brolin is an under rated actor as per me. In the only well written role of a studio fixer Mannix, Brolin gives us performance I could easily relate to. A hard working family man who tries to keep everyone happy and run the studio yet is disturbed and looking for inner peace. A nice performance and I hope in the future Brolin gets similar well written roles in better written movies."

"leonblackwood","5","6","8","20 October 2016"," Not the best from the Coen Brothers! 5/10
","Review: I'm usually a fan of these type of quirky movies but this film was all over the place! There was so much stories going on at once, so it was pretty hard to follow and I wasn't that impressed with the different characters that kept on getting introduced throughout the movie. George Clooney's weird face expressions made me laugh in a few of the scenes and Tilda Swinton, who played the twins Thora Thacker/Thessaly Thacker, also was quite funny but I didn't really see the point of some of the characters. Jonah Hill (Joe Silverman) and Ralph Fiennes (Laurence Laurentz) are only in a couple of scenes, and the main character, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) just seems to be running around, trying to keep everyone happy. The movie is based in a movie studio during the 1950's, and it follows Eddie Mannix, who is trying to find a big shot actor, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), who has been kidnapped by a bunch of writers. While he is on the hunt for Whitlock, who is being held for a ransom of $100,000, Mannix has to make sure that the big budget movies that are being filmed, are under control, and he has to handle the press who are constantly on his back for information. The period was portrayed quite well throughout the movie, and Josh Brolin played the lead quite well but it was hard to find a point to the whole project. There wasn't much of an ending to the various stories and no one seemed that bothered about Baird Whitlocks random disappearance. With all of that aside, it's a still a watchable movie, because you don't know what directed the plot is going to take from one scene to the next but I still expected something special, once I saw the cast. Its not the type of film that will go down as a classic but I have to commend it for it's originality and witty script. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: After watching many of the Coen Brothers work, I was really looking forward to this movie but it didn't live up to its expectations. There first movie came out in 1984, called Blood Simple, which was followed by Raising Arizona, Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and the Hudsucker Proxy. They then hit the big time with Fargo, in 1996 and then came the brilliant, The Big Lebowski, which I thoroughly enjoyed. After that came O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Man Who Wasn't There, Intolerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers, Paris, je t'aime, No Country For Old Men, Burn After Reading, A Serious Man, True Grit and Inside Llewyn Davis, which all made a profit at the box office and established there name in Hollywood. All of the A-list stars want to work with them, mainly because of there unique style and approach to film making. I wouldn't say that this film is there best work but it won't damaged there reputation as great film makers.<br/><br/>Budget: $22million Worldwide Gross: $63million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their mystery/comedies, starring Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Ralph Riennes, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Veronica Osorio, Alison Pill, Chrisopher Lambert and Clancy Brown. 5/10"
"kaaber-2","10","13","21","20 February 2016"," Hail, the Coens!
","I saw ""Hail, Caesar!"" yesterday, and I was baffled. First at the brilliance of the film, then at the grumpiness of several of the reviews and then ultimately, at the film again. It did not escape me, however, that I was the one laughing hardest and longest in the cinema, but this, in turn, puzzles me as well. Perhaps the reason is that Marcuse and the Hollywood Reds are held up to ridicule, but I think that's only fair, as well as rare, for films generally bemoan the fate of the liberal extremists (I haven't seen ""Trumbo"" yet). My approach to the Red Scare in Hollywood is as follows: if the Hollywood commies had really had their way and socialism had moved into Tinsel Town, which is to say: if their spurious dreams of a socialist paradise had come true and Moscow had invaded Washington, these guys would not only have been out of a job for opposing the government and party politics - they would have disappeared to the Gulags of Siberia or would have been shot, no questions asked. For once, a film does not see them as innocent victims of irrational persecution, but as dupes for a system even more corrupt than Hollywood. I salute that. ""Hail Caesar"" is an affectionate portrait of a by-gone era and a tribute to the hard-working people who worked under the old studio system. Also, it's hilarious! The film editor (McDormand) who almost does an Isadora Duncan when she gets her scarf in the machine; the studio assistant asking Jesus on the cross whether he's a principal or an extra, and Jesus modestly replying 'a principal'; and the hilarious direction of western idol Hobie when he crosses over into genteel comedies and has to speak unspeakable lines with inane direction; producer Mannix (Brolin) taking confessions on a daily basis for smoking, although it would seem he has a lot more to confess – and yet, what the film ultimately dares to state, after decades of putting down Hollywood as a dream factory and a capitalist Babylon, is that they really had talent back then. And so do the Coens. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a masterpiece of pastiche virtuosity, and, as for the politics in this comedy, the Coens, at least to my way of thinking, finally set the record straight."

He must deal with actors, actresses, and directors with deep flaws, but in the process we see wonderful scenes being filmed. Spoiler alert: at the end of the day everyone gets their job done.

","After reflecting on Hail Cesar, I stand by my initial response of ranking this below both A Serious Man and Intolerable Cruelty. The trailer is ridiculously misleading, what you see in the trailer looks like a Coen comedy about the kidnapping of an offbeat Clooney character. What follows is a quasi musical drama about a no nonsense Hollywood executive moving from Grand scene to grand scene (all of which add up to nothing) while the bros. rely on another kidnapping plot line, all to highlight communism in the film industry in the 50's (and the blacklisted writers).<br/><br/>Clooney portrays no charisma or off beat Coen charm in his bland and forgettable role. Scarlett Johansson actually takes away from the film, as her atrocious accent makes you want to leave the theater. Tatum struts around as a pretty boy closet case sailor, in the gayest musical scene ever. Tilda Swinton's 2 roles are slightly annoying as is the western actor trying to act dramatically. Ralph Fiennes and Josh Brolin neither add anything pr take anything away, they are just there.<br/><br/>The only redeeming parts were a nervous Wayne Knight, and a Hollywood meeting about religion in the current film being made between 4 holy men, in which the rabbi steals the entire movie. It sucks to write this and feel this way, but IMO, the Coen Bros are best when they tell a small story, this is a grand spectacle all over the place, but not in any place you want to go. The worst Coen Bros. Movie to date and only worthy of watching when on a deep deep Coen Bros. kick."
"maurice_yacowar","10","11","18","14 February 2016"," Hollywood fixer finds faith in sustaining illusions
","The Coens' Hail Caesar may be the most serious comedy in the theatres today. It confronts our essential dilemma: how to live a life of faith and service in the corrupt modern world. 1950s Hollywood, of course, is the essence of modernity, projected images of virtue and the fantasy of piety.<br/><br/>The two historic figures in this fiction embody two competing faiths. The Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a practicing Catholic. In the opening and late scenes he's at confession, seeking absolution for having lied to his wife and relapsed into smoking. Even the priest advises that his daily confession is too much. Ironically, his confessed sins — however deeply troubling to him — are rather trivial for a man engaged 24/7 in abetting all sorts of sins and crimes, bribing the cops, paying off kidnappers and blackmailers. Not to mention neglecting his family and principles. Mannix's religion is quite safely detached from his daily deeds. But he is ardently faithful. <br/><br/>The other, more marginal historic figure is Prof. Marcuse (John Bluthal), presumably Herbert Marcuse, the influential Marxist philosopher who advocates social revolution against the suppression by organized religion. Instead of rendering unto Caesar (that's the historic Caesar, not the one in the Hollywood world inhabited by the actor George Clooney plays) the things that are Caesar's, or giving them to the church, the communists would grab them to share out among the citizenry. For that they need to overthrow the religious, economic and political order. (Aside, pace G.K. Chesterton: The trouble with socialism as with Christianity is that it has never really been tried.) <br/><br/>Mannix's dilemma takes the form of a choice between two jobs. He can continue as the amoral and illegal Hollywood fixer or he can accept the far easier and financially more rewarding career offered by Lockheed Airlines. Mannix asks which job would better serve God's will. Flying the civilian skies or the even more secular job of protecting the Hollywood stars in the profane Hollywood galaxy. Spoiler alert: he picks the latter profane.<br/><br/>Mannix realizes his calling when he slaps the kidnapped star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) out of his newly injected Communism. Serving God is serving man. And vice (so to speak) versa. Mannix finds a religious fulfillment in maintaining the public's dream life and his coworkers' and bosses' successful careers. He will serve God on earth not in the Lockheed skies. The secular faith emanates from the last shot, a water tower reading ""Behold"" against the (unusually) clear Hollywood skies.<br/><br/>Two points validate Mannix's choice. His pitch from Lockheed's rep includes the promising future the company sees in the recent atomic bomb tests on Bikini Beach. So the easier job may not be cleaner after all. <br/><br/>And for all its tawdriness, greed and sinfulness, Hollywood is still capable of enriching its audience's spiritual lives. This we see when the crew and cast members are individually enrapt and moved to tears by the climactic speech by the converted centurion (Clooney as Whitlock). Whitlock smashes the illusion by forgetting the climactic word: ""faith."" But until then, his performance has created a moment in which even the most hardened observers, the people working the falseness of the set, are delivered into belief. Hollywood's illusion can be as spiritual as the religions'. <br/><br/>Mannix's division within himself has two parallels. Tilda Swinton plays two twin sisters, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, furiously rival gossip columnists, whose difference is masked by their posturing and garb. As Mannix is a man torn in two, the twins are two in one. They are also a secular parody of the contentious division of the Trinity. <br/><br/>The film itself is a division. It bears the title of the film the Clooney character is making. But frequently a scene erupts from another film, another genre, like the underwater ballet or the sailors' homoerotic dance number. Here we don't know if the scene is ""life"" or a film staging. The film is less the traditional ""film within a film"" than an exercise in cinematic delusion, a celebration of classic Hollywood fantasy. Hence the variety of popular genres, like the musical, western, romance. <br/><br/>We're always watching the artifice of reality here. In ""real life"" scenes actors do their performance pieces, like the actress with her illicit photo shoot, the cowboy star entertaining himself with his lariat act, then his date with a noodle version. Though an executive not an actor, Mannix spends his life ""performing"" to keep his vagrant charges' private lives on the studio script. Hence his machinations around an unwed pregnant star. <br/><br/>But there is also the reality of artifice, like the dramatic effect of Whitlock's performance. More deeply, the film presents Hollywood as the dream factory that sustains the ambivalent social effects of capitalism. When the Communists abduct and brainwash Whitlock their naive idealism threatens the fabric of American life. So there is virtue and social responsibility in Mannix's recovery of the vacuous star, his defence of American capitalism and his choice of serving God through Hollywood rather than through Lockheed.<br/><br/>This is a very timely film in two respects. First, it rebuts Trumbo, which sanitized its hero by downplaying the foolishness of the Hollywood communists whose faith ignored the shocking reality of Stalinism, the show trials, the dangerous spies. They were the blind idealists Lenin had called ""useful idiots."" This film presents Hollywood's Communist scriptwriters as those idiots, dazzled by their own clichés and rhetoric. When they lose the satchel with the $100,000 blackmail money their useful idiocy proves futile and absurd.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film's treatment of Hollywood piety is a timely corrective to the Republican campaign for the presidency. Their entire slate, especially leaders Trump and Cruz, project the fake faith and spurious piety the commercialized religion of Hollywood plays out here. They'll feel unjustly justified that the gay director proves a Commie."

The irony of so many of the scenes was exceptional in its humor, as, for example, the sumptuous household of the Communists, and the gay undertones of the sailor dance scene.

","Around the halfway mark of the Coen Brothers' newest film, Hail, Caesar!, an audience member was heard voicing his thought that, this was the weirdest movie he had ever seen–and this reviewer wouldn't say his evaluation was all that far off.<br/><br/>Yet it's exactly this sort of ""weird-ness"" that defines any Coen Brothers' movie, where colorful but mentally clouded characters are typically confronted with cosmically coincidental events, leading to a type of larger, dead-pan comedy, that's dripping in drop-dead seriousness that forces them to question the meaning of life and their place in the universe.<br/><br/>The universe at large in Hail, Caesar! is the 1950s back lot of the fictional Capitol Pictures, an MGM-like Hollywood studio whose theatrical world offers such wonderfully wacky tangents as bumbling cowboy movie stars lassoing with their spaghetti, as well as looming scares of Communism and learning of the first Hydrogen bombs.<br/><br/>At the center of this world, the ringleader of the Circus, is Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a Hollywood fixer whose job it is to keep the studio's stars in line, but whose own personal certainties are less assured. As if trying to quit a light smoking habit wasn't the biggest hiccup in his day (the film covers a twenty-seven-hour day), Mannix learns of the kidnapping and ransom demand of the studio's biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), during the shooting of his lead role in the grandly epic big-picture event, titled, 'Hail, Caesar!' <br/><br/>Mannix proceeds to bop around from one looney tuned character to the next, including the Dixie-whistling cowboy turned bumbling big screen star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), twice- divorced movie star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), twin sister newspaper journalists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton), and tap-dancing Gene Kelly inspired Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), who all amount to being an embarrassment of riches in Coen-land.<br/><br/>The Hollywood send-up may be much more divisive than the directors' other films, and likely because it's packaged as a mainstream movie with the likes of George Clooney and Channing Tatum cartooning around as old-timey Hollywood movie stars. But the Coens' only take the shell of old Hollywood and collapse the facade, exploring stories of kidnapping and hijinks, as well as much larger, universal themes of exploration and questioning, such as Politics, Religion, and other head-scratching questions akin to, What Does It All Mean? This search for meaning in a world so ridiculous, that it allows its audience to see the coded philosophic themes and lessons that its harebrained characters can't, makes this another winning outing for the Coen's.<br/><br/>The Coen's continue to eschew conventions of narrative structure, allowing their incredible style to drive the film here. Audiences expecting a more classic kidnap comedy will most likely be disappointed by the odd tangential story lines, but should know that the minds of this machine are operating on a top-tier level of intelligence that makes a minute long scene, of Hobie Doyle fumbling the phonetics of a sophisticated line like, ""Would that it were so simple,"" give resonance to the entirety of the story–if only life were so simple.<br/><br/>For more, visit www.CINEMACY.com"

","The brothers-ever-grimmer no longer have anything to say; perhaps they are in the thrall of yes-men; and now cynically have betrayed their audience. The marketing, however, was superb: the promise of such talent... A little taste and you thought, ""Finally, a true sophisticated Hollywood comedy."" And then you get there and Frances McDormand gets less than a minute. The lure turned out to be nearly all cameos. As for the architecture: big ideas, all garbled. Pieces of something but nothing more. So disappointing. The truth is, this is not the beginning of decline but confirmation. But you wonder how could they have gotten this to market? Who would have taken this on? For sure there has always been a cynical streak in Coen films, but in the better films, mixed with significance. Now, nothing. Where is Mel Brooks when you most need him?"

","This is the worst movie I ever have seen. George Cooney is a great actor and does great scenes but the movie can't be saved. My friends were with me and agreed that it's a bad movie...hard to follow. The scenes were hard to follow. Not worth watching this movie. I don't understand how it got such a high rating at IMDb. It's nowhere near as good as THE NOTEBOOK or STARWARS. It's rated a ZERO but the lowest I could give it was a 1.<br/><br/>Several of the scenes made no sense at all. George Clooney was dressed in a great roman soldiers costume. I think the costumes were great for the period of time (mid 1950's era), but the storyline of the movie stunk."

","As a scriptwriter I have read many books on what makes a good film. Quite often you hear the same phrases over and over again; such as 'Its all about the structure', make the audience care for the protagonist', and most importantly, 'if you can cut out a scene and it makes no difference to the story, cut it out.' And essentially that is the problem with this film. There were so many scenes which had no relevance to the plot that I wondered if I was watching the out takes. Clearly the golden age of Hollywood is full of treasures, and the story of a studio fixer in the 50's should be the stuff Oscars are made of. But the George Clooney plot line slowly fades, until halfway through you really don't care what happens to him. A whole load of actors come and go, and again, nobody cares, the Scarlett Johansson story being pointless. And it is a shame as all that talent, including the sets and the lighting, is wasted by a poor script. I did enjoy the Ralph Fiennes character, but as a cinema experience, I came, I saw, I conked out."
"ryanmark-57919","7","5","7","10 February 2016"," Not the Worst Coen Brothers Movie but No Where Near the Best
","Full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of the Coen brothers and I'm probably going to give a recommendation to just about anything they make. This film is no exception. That being said, this movie is quite a bit different than I was expecting but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The Coens usually manage to surpass my expectations but this film didn't interest me quite as much as their other work. I still enjoyed it though and we'll get to some of the problems in just a moment. For now, let's take a look at the story.<br/><br/>Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer in 1950s Hollywood and his main job is basically taking care of all of the directors, actors, and actresses working for the studio. These include Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), and DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johannson). Mannix is busy with everyone's problems but things get even worse when Baird Whitlock is kidnapped by communists demanding a ransom of 100,000 dollars. In addition to this craziness, Mannix is contemplating a move to a different career and starts to question his future.<br/><br/>Alright, this probably goes without saying but the cast for this film is topnotch. Brolin does a decent job as Mannix and I thought he carried the movie relatively well. Brolin has never been the kind of guy to emote a great deal but I still found myself smiling from ear to ear while he's trying to deal with all these different (and quite frankly, childish) problems. Clooney gives us a fantastic Whitlock and it makes me wish he would do more comedy. Whitlock is a great actor but he's dimwitted and doesn't seem to realize the situation he's in. Everyone gave pretty good performances but there are so many characters that it feels like none of them really get a whole lot of attention other than Mannix. Most of the characters did play a part in the overall story of the film (Scarlett Johannson wasn't one of them) but our time with them was so brief. For example, Channing Tatum plays a character named Burt Gurney. Gurney only shows up in about three or four scenes throughout the movie but his character still plays an important role in the overarching plot. I would say it felt like a waste if it wasn't for the very well done dancing scene involving Gurney and some other actors.<br/><br/>Everything looks pretty much exactly how you would imagine it would look. This is 1950s Hollywood after all. Lots of different film sets and the California countryside make it obvious where we are. It's straightforward but it gets the job done and it looks great. It's obvious that the main point of the story is to follow all of these wacky personalities and the different sets and locations just let us know what they're doing at the time. I did enjoy Ehrenreich's character stepping onto a fancy ballroom (it's not really a ballroom but I don't know what it's called) set for the first time and being obviously out of his element.<br/><br/>Honestly, I enjoyed the story and the characters quite a bit but the plot still feels a little loose. I enjoyed all the characters so I don't know who I would have gotten rid of but it's obvious that there were just too many people and not enough time for each one. Still, it's not perfect but the movie is enjoyable and the Coens' have a very particular sense of dry humor that I can't help but enjoy. I would recommend giving it a shot but just don't go in expecting the next Big Lebowski or anything like that."
"Ramascreen","5","5","7","3 February 2016"," Baffling!
","For every part of HAIL CAESAR that's attractive and entertaining, there's an equal part that will leave you baffled. Don't get me wrong, I'm speaking as a fan of the Coen Bros' brand of comedy (""O Brother Where Art Thou,"" ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" ""Burn After Reading"") but I just don't think HAIL CAESAR's oddity would resonate with audiences.<br/><br/>Starring Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum, Hail, Caesar! follows a single day in the life of a studio fixer who is presented with plenty of problems to fix.<br/><br/>At times HAIL CAESAR can be a quite goofy, it's more or less a nod to the golden age of Hollywood, those old movies that would have the characters suddenly bust out in song and dancing, Channing Tatum gives a scene-stealing performance in this department with his little sailor number, it's definitely the scene that audiences would mostly talk about after the end credits roll.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays the biggest star in Hollywood who gets kidnapped by a group of writers that happen to carry a certain ideology of their own, so HAIL CAESAR somewhat also pokes fun at that whole communist witch-hunt back in the day even prior to Trumbo era. Josh Brolin plays a studio fixer that has a lot on his plate, juggling frustrated directors and arrogant stars and untalented actors, and now he has to also deal with this kidnapping. But if there's one thing that Coen Bros' comedies have in common is that without the lead character having to try too hard, everything seems to work itself out in the end.<br/><br/>Yes you'll laugh, there's no doubt you'll have a bit of fun watching HAIL CAESAR especially with the characters buying so much into their buffoonery because almost all of them think that they're all that, their ego is wildly amusing, and Josh Brolin's character, the studio fixer, is no different. Co-star Tilda Swinton is also another one that's going to crack you up even though her face is not on this film's poster. Great costumes and marvelous production design that take you back to the enchanting days of Fred Astaire and Ginger Ross. HAIL CAESAR also gives you pause to wonder if Hollywood, in many ways, is still as controlling as they were in the golden age. But I think what the Coen Bros' are trying to really convey, what they're really trying to satirize often gets lost in the film's attractive choreography. So yes, you will laugh, but you'll also be massively confused."
"ginocox-206-336968","10","9","15","4 May 2016"," A subtly brilliant paean and parody of Hollywood's golden age
","""Hail, Caesar!"" may not be the best Coen Brothers movie ever, but then again, it might just be and even a film that ranks somewhere in the middle of their oeuvre is better than the best films by most writers and directors. <br/><br/>The movie is meticulously detailed and intricately interwoven. It's both a paean to and parody of movies from Hollywood's Golden Age. It's often fascinating and frequently hilarious. Performances and production values are uniformly excellent. It's a very intelligent film, meticulously researched, with humor that ranges from subtle and sophisticated to broad and burlesque. <br/><br/>What it lacks are genuine highs and lows. A movie star is kidnapped, but is never in any real peril. An uneventful car chase ends without a confrontation. At several points, the film or a film within the film builds toward a climatic moment, only to have it deliberately subverted, usually for comic effect. The protagonist's day entails handling a series of disasters, but he handles them almost effortlessly due to his comprehensive understanding of the industry and his absolute authority and the disasters never really spiral out of control or build exponentially, as in some action and comedy films. <br/><br/>It's a film that one could probably watch a dozen times and notice additional nuances with each viewing."
"bot-kao-104-230568","3","9","15","13 March 2016"," A complete and utter mess
","As much as I love the Coen brothers, they've truly messed up what could have been a promising film in Hail, Caesar. I think the Coens are trying to be too clever for their own good and in this instance, it has well and truly backfired. One of the missing ingredients is the Coen brothers' trademark absurd sense of humour e.g. The Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou, Raising Arizona just to name some of their most hysterically foot stomping funny films.<br/><br/>There were simply too many elements and sub stories in Hail, Caesar that ultimately led nowhere. How would one draw the threads linking a studio executive (Josh Brolin) looking for a missing leading man (George Clooney) who was kidnapped by a group of communist writers, whose mysterious leader also happens to be a campy, tap dancing sailor and a premadonna-ish Hollywood actress (Scarlet Johanssen) trying to offload her child so she can re-adopt it? And that's just the main story line. There are other sub plots that are much too confusing or pointless to introduce in this review. Suffice it to say that this turned out to be a complete mess of a film. <br/><br/>For filmmakers as talented as the Coen brothers this is a real disappointment."
"MCMAYNERBERRY","5","18","35","4 February 2016"," Rather Disappointing
","I'm typically not very enthusiastic about the Coen brothers comedy movies, but I heard this one was about the shenanigans of the film industry in the early days, so I was modestly excited.<br/><br/>So it's unfortunate that Hail Caesar is a bland, unfunny experience with only sporadic chuckles.<br/><br/>The Coen's assembled an A-list cast for this outing: George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, etc. And outside of the main characters Brolin and Clooney play, everyone else feels...squandered. Wasted in over glorified cameos. Jonah Hill's only scene in the movie was featured in the trailer. And all other members of the cast are involved in plot lines not directly involved with the main story. Like what Family Guy goes with their non sequiturs.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is definitely the weakest link in the cast, donning a hokey and distracting New York accent as she goes about playing an actress who's pregnant during her movie's filming (oh, the irony). It just seemed like an unnecessary part of the film that could've easily gone without.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins is once again behind the camera and once again delivers a stunning visual palate, but it doesn't do much to help the movie from feeling dull and overall a disappointing effort from the Coen's. Though it isn't on the level of disappointing as The Ladykillers, it is far, FAR from being on the level of Fargo and The Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>Hai, Caesar! 5/10"
"kpitzmc","2","8","13","23 February 2016"," Majorly Boring
","This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in a theater! Can't believe the Koens made this disaster with such a fine cast of actors. I am a big fan of Josh Brolin, George Clooney, and the rest of the actors, and even at my age, love Channing Tatum and his fine self, but other than watching Tatum's dance scene, I was completely under whelmed. Really people, it was so boring I went to sleep, and I never nap! I woke up after a few moments and yes, it was still boring and I had no trouble figuring out the plot. I sat there for a few more minutes and was nodding again so I left, so unless the last 10 minutes were riveting, I have to vote Hail Caesar the most boring movie I've seen in ages. Of course the comfy reclining seat didn't hurt either, lol."
"catherinejohnson9","3","6","9","8 March 2016"," Clooney Catastrophe
","The star line up for this film is impressive but that's as far as it goes. I thought it sounded like a fun romp but the reality is it's a laboured take on the studio system. The characters are very 2 dimensional and the storyline is impossibly weak. I find it hard to believe Clooney could play such a lame role and how on earth did they make him look so unattractive? Alden Ehrenreich did manage to shine in portraying his role as Hobie and his performance did generate laughs. Otherwise there was a distinct lack of laughter in the aisles. Josh Brolin provided the necessary gravitas and could've provided a ready foil for the comedic elements but this was never really exploited. I really fail to see why so many respected actors would risk their reputations in a film of such low calibre. It is certainly not one of the Coen brothers better offerings and I think they are simply riding on their reputation."
"Ben_Cap","7","7","11","14 February 2016"," Maybe not Hail, Caesar, but certainly praise, Caesar.
","Hail, Caesar! brings all of the elements of a good Coen brothers satire. It is incredibly casted, truly funny and difficult to fully understand at times. Even though the classic movie references went over my head most of the time, the clear attention to detail and an obvious massive amount of research shines through to make Hail Caesar if nothing else a very watchable 2 hours.<br/><br/>The Coens have always been great at casting and this may be their best effort. Some characters are underutilized but the leads are damn near perfect. Clooney may be the best vessel for the Coens to put their brand of physical comedy on screen and He always seems to be on the same page with them. Josh Brolin is never a guy who I have been concerned with putting a great performance on screen and he, like Clooney seems to have found this nice median with the Coens making a character here that will rank among Brolin's best. The rest of the cast as previously stated is filled with strong performances by major leading actors. Alden Ehrenreich should not go unmentioned as Hobie Doyle, a movie cowboy who is thrust into the world of dramatic acting. This may have been the find of the movie for the Coens, and I am excited to see wheat he can do.<br/><br/>I have always preferred the Coen brothers satires more than their more serious movies and that is because of the strength of the writing. The dark and subtle humor that they are able to achieve is usually top class, but this movie has a little more Ladykillers than Fargo. Hail, Caesar! is without a doubt an attempt at a more mainstream comedy. This is not to say the movie is not funny, it is a funny movie, but the comedy comes from a more traditional sense, which only disappoints because of the strength of their more subtle comedy. There are more classic cinema references in this movie than I can count, and most of those went over my head, but I think that is the Coens intention. They wanted the movie to be satisfying for movie buffs and the casual viewer and the like.<br/><br/>When first watching the movie I was disappointing in the look of the film. I figured with the Coens making a movie about classic cinema that the look of the movie would be right out of the golden years of cinema and when the movie started I was not given what I expected. As the movie progresses and we stop in on all of these different movie sets I was proved wrong. They wanted a visual separation between when the viewer is watching the movie presented on screen, and the movies inside the movie on screen. The classic dramas look as if someone time traveled to the 1930s and grabbed an actress in full costume and makeup and brought them back to the Hail, Caesar! set. A very impressive looking movie, especially for fans of cinema.<br/><br/>I scored the movie lower than most Coen brothers films, not because it was not a good movie, or there was something in it that turned me off, but just because the catalog of Coen brothers movies is so strong. Hail, Caesar is no Fargo or Lebowski or O' Brother Where Art Thou, but then again is was never supposed to be like any of those movies. They are at the point in their careers where they don't need to make their innovative and groundbreaking movies to prove themselves anymore. It seems like they are just doing movie about things that interest them more than what they think will surprise everyone. If you are a Coens fan check it out. If you like semi-off brand comedies give it a shot, just know what to expect going in."
"bradskyb","10","2","2","12 August 2019"," They Probably Didn't Get It
","I read a bunch of the reviews below on this movie, and I was annoyed because I didn't see one of them who seemed to get what the story was really about. In my opinion, it's a scathing indictment of communism specifically, but it also hints at the immorality of statism in general. While others were annoyed by the silliness of the communists losing the briefcase, I found it to be a deeply satirical representation of the only thing the communists were ever good at: destroying wealth and everything that is good with it, and all for an apparition of an ideal that's as silly as the toy dog it was sacrificed for in the film. The cherry on top for me was when he blames the dog for the mishap, highlighting how willfully ignorant and dense these stubborn adherents are to their own folly.<br/><br/>The story finishes off with what I view as an allusion to the immorality of the state as the protagonist confesses his sins and asks for advice from his priest on whether to take a job. He ultimately takes the road less traveled, the one that is right, or moral as it were, and ultimately chooses what is right over what is easy by continuing to work in films. Before I watched this movie I would say it would be a tall order credibly painting a deceptive film-making enterprise as the moral choice, but when it's compared to selling your wares to the military-industrial complex and communist chicanery, the Coens resoundingly convinced me of it.<br/><br/>Something I've enjoyed over the years watching Coen Brothers movies is that as I unpeel the onion revealed in each story, upon repeated viewings of course, I notice constant references to philosophy. While I'm not sure based upon their movies that we would see eye-to-eye on philosophy and morality, I'm appreciative of how they subtly discuss them in each film, letting the results of the characters' frequent ignorance of these matters, and the ensuing tragedies that befall them, speak for themselves rather than preaching to the audience what one should do. In other words, it's not prescriptive, but allegorical.<br/><br/>Finally I'd like to say that I found the movie to be wildly entertaining. I laughed out loud several times and almost woke my kids up in the process. The spoofing of all those old movies, only some of which I'm familiar with, came through in a very obvious way for me. You can't have seen any of those films and not enjoyed this one poking fun at them. This is storytelling at its finest. Pay attention or you might miss it."

"duoseraphim-598-532621","7","2","2","19 May 2017"," Worth watching?
","This is my first review here, and I hope to do more. I have noticed a niche that can use more contributions, namely, reviews written by people who love movies, but who are not trying to prove how terribly clever and smart they are. Many years ago one of the major movie critics wrote for a metropolitan newspaper, and he had a funny list of categories for movies, the best one being 'worth watching if you're home sick.' His reviews helped me think about why some deeply flawed movies are worth watching, while some highly praised films are simply, for most of us, pretentious junk. 'Hail, Caesar!' is one of the former. First and foremost, any movie that makes you laugh, laugh a lot, is certainly worth your time. The main criticism I have is that it doesn't hang together well. The skits are related, but there is not enough of a strong narrative thread here to pull you through to the end, to give you that sense of 'wow' that a really good movie gives you. The casting is intriguing, with flashes of brilliance. George Clooney is a smart choice; he gave me much to think about regarding the interaction of skill and charisma in a performance. I was also wondering how Josh Brolin made his character likable. And Scarlett Johansson's first appearance is very amusing, as well as one of the movie's many reminders of the sharp contrast between movie fantasies, and the quotidian of our lives that drives us to seek out that very fantasy.<br/><br/>So, to steal from the above-mentioned reviewer, 'worth watching at home.'"
"ragpap93","5","2","2","9 March 2017"," Hail, Rubish!
","Great visuals mean nothing if the acting is so wooden. The superb cast has been utilized for nothing but their names. The cowboy's lassoing was probably the only highlight of the whole movie. Channing Tatum danced quite alright but he was no Gene Kelly. It felt like a Wes Anderson movie but somehow this technique works in his movies alone. <br/><br/>There is no discernible plot. What I could make out is that Clooney's character gets kidnapped by the communist section of the film industry and the demand for money was not really out of desperation as they have plenty of money. To Clooney some stupid explanation was given and the delusional Clooney accepts it and after being released repeats all that his captors have told him to Brolin, the Hollywood fixer who just slaps him to snap him out of it. I guess what everyone making this movie needed was a good slap like that to snap them out of this. <br/><br/>Scarlett's character has a baby with a father who left and a single mum is going to result in a career-ending situation. Somehow Tatum was part of the communist film industry and the cowboy out of the blue seeing him with a briefcase which could mean anything really, decides to pursue him. The cowboy rescues Clooney while all his kidnappers were giving a send-off to their beloved communist hero Tatum who was headed to Moscow in a submarine. The dog was funnier than anyone there. It abruptly ends like it was just another day in showbiz not to be mistaken with the movie being short as it dragged on painfully. <br/><br/>Not a horrible movie but not a good one either. All effort was directed at the set but none on the script and dialogue."

","Well, the Coen Brothers sure know a thing or two about making a film, and you will see plenty of it in Hail Caesar; but, is that enough.<br/><br/>Hail Caesar is the rather loose story of a film star that gets kidnapped by a group of Hollywood technical personnel, on the grounds that the studios they work for exploit them. Around this main plot, there's a few other subplots related to the period's Hollywood scene (bad actors, raunchy actresses, lazy crews, primadonnas), all held together by Josh Brolin (Detective Trupo_'s character, a ""fixer"" who makes sure things go smoothly despite having to work with these various airheads.<br/><br/>From a stylistic point of view, it's another jewel from the Coen Brothers; every frame a painting, nearly. The lights, sets, camera-work, it's all impeccable.<br/><br/>But, unlike many of their previous works, Hail Caesar winds up being a bit .. boring.<br/><br/>It's really down to personal preference, but i find the script to be pretty weak. Compared to many of their previous successes, such as Oh Brother, Hudsucker Proxy, True Grit, Lebowsky, or Fargo, this latest film just doesn't have the same kind of witty writing, intriguing story, and absurdist characters which we've come to expect from the Coens.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend Hail Caesar; Clooney phones it in for what little screen time he has, the subplots are unremarkable, the whole film is rather forgettable.<br/><br/>My vote, despite being a great Coen fan: 6.5/10 - skip this one."

He also happens to be a by-the-book Catholic who regularly goes to a priest to confess minor sins like cigarette smoking.<br/><br/>There is not a single boring or bad performance by any of the huge cluster of actors. Clooney as the doofus leading man whose kidnapping drives much of the plot, gives an inspired performance. Alden Ehrenreich is impressive on all levels as the wholesome and good- natured singing cowboy. Allison Pill is the embodiment of classic pre-feminist womanhood as the pretty, positive, loyal, uncomplaining, blonde cupcake of a wife who maintains the home front for the rugged breadwinner Brolin.<br/><br/>Many characters loosely suggest real figures of the studio era: George Clooney = Clark Gable; Tilda Swinton as twin-sister gossip columnists = not only Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons (who were definitely not sisters) but also carrying a whiff of rival siblings Olivia deHavilland and Joan Fontaine, born of British parents in the Far East, who famously hated each other throughout their parallel star careers; Scarlett Johansson = Loretta Young who covered up her out-of-wedlock birth by disappearing for a few months and resurfacing with an ""adopted"" daughter; Ralph Fiennes = a British variation on director George Cukor who was rumored to have had sex with pre-stardom Clark Gable; Alden Ehrenreich = Roy Rogers (whom he actually resembles); Channing Tatum = a dash of Gene Kelly and a dab of Dick Powell. And others.<br/><br/>This is not the first Coen film to incorporate musical performance and begs the question, why doesn't this team make an all-out film musical? The Channing Tatum song-and-dance number, vaguely reminiscent of Busby Berkeley's ""Shanghai Li'l"" from ""Footlight Parade"" and Ehrenreich's pitch perfect warbling in a Western musical scene are high points.<br/><br/>Memorable and brilliantly written scenes include a theological roundtable of religious leaders assembled by Brolin to vet the production of the titular film-within-the-film, a ""Ben-Hur""-ish epic about a Roman centurion's encounter with Jesus Christ (the scenes from which are stylistically dead-on perfect take-offs on the post-WW2 widescreen ancient epics); and a parallel gathering of Hollywood Communist Party screenwriters strategizing philosophically about ways to use dialectical materialism as a guide to insert Party propaganda into film scripts and hasten a new world (goof: a Communist refers to making a cash ""contribution to the Comintern"" which had been long dismantled by the time this film takes place); a fey director's frustrated attempts to coach the miscast cowboy actor's delivery of high-toned cocktail party dialogue. <br/><br/>Finally we are reminded that movie-going in studio-era Hollywood was a kind of organized religious experience; no matter what traditional religious practices moviegoers or producers may have observed, the paganism of the screen experience was an equal influence on their lives."

Simply put, this is a classic case of a movie trailer being more entertaining than the actual movie itself.<br/><br/>I understand that the movie is a satire on Hollywood and the craziness that goes on there, but it could have at-least been a bit more amusing. We are shown the craziness of random casting changes, Hollywood gossip, political intervention, director-actor relationships, and the difficulty of keeping everything together. But in doing so, the overall story meanders and never comes full circle (or all that coherent for that matter). The title character (Brolin) goes from one set to the next as we are shown elaborate dance scenes, giant sets, and behind the scenes turmoil. The problem is these scenes do nothing to advance the plot. It's a nice trip down memory lane to see old school productions, but that's it. It's all glitz and glamour and no brains.<br/><br/>Caesar may have a ton of star power and production designs galore, but it simply lacks the most fundamental aspect a movie requires, entertainment. I wish I could say I found the movie hilarious or thought-provoking or tense, but I can't. Everything here felt half-baked and the story that seemed to be at the core felt very underdeveloped. Leading to the overall experience being rather boring (I know this is one of the worst words to describe a movie but it appropriately fits here). For a superior experience, go watch 'Trumbo' instead."

","This movie is a success on so many levels that it is hard to do it justice in a short review, but here goes. Superficially, the film is a light-hearted comedy about the foibles of people in the 1950s Hollywood film industry, which are just glamorized, larger-than-life sins and failings of humans in general - immorality, stupidity, intoxication and the like - magnified by dramatic nature of the movie trade and the secondary, parasitic gossip-publication industry. The real genius of ""Hail, Caesar,"" however, is the way the surface narrative is intricately and artfully interwoven with one of the central struggles of 20th Century history, in a way that is subtle yet deeply moving. This struggle, which continues today, is the battle for the hearts and minds of mankind, a battle between the god of the Almighty Secular State (in this movie, Soviet Communism) and the God of the Bible. The protagonist, Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney), is an actor kidnapped by a communist cell and held for ransom. He is almost swayed to the communist cause by the persuasive rants of the various cell members (including the detestable Professor Herbert Marcuse, who was a real-life American professor with an incredibly potent, destructive legacy). The ""fixer"" who works for Whitlock's studio (Eddie Mannix, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin) recovers Whitlock and literally slaps the commie nonsense out of him, restoring him to productive sanity. The three minutes in the movie where a rabbi, a Catholic priest, an Eastern Orthodox priest, and a Protestant minister debate the acceptability of the movie studio's depiction of Christ is comedy gold. Do not miss this movie, especially if you were born after 1970!"

","Acting is great, direction is great, music is awesome, there is no story and it's great! No story? Well, you see there is no classical story, no character arc or anything similar, but what we get instead is a ""day in a life"" view that's just an excuse for a bunch of really funny sequences. And it works brilliantly, in case you were wondering.<br/><br/>It's a world of an overworked producer full of promiscuous movie stars, prissy directors, communist conspiracies, clumsy kidnappers, and Jesus Christ too.<br/><br/>The only downside in my opinion is that some of the jokes rely too heavily on knowing the tropes of 1950s movies, but it didn't seem to bother anyone I was watching this with.<br/><br/>So yeah - it's a fun two hours!"

","Interesting combo of send-up and genuine entertainment. For example, there are two production numbers that are exaggerated, but not in a way that diminishes the original genres that they were derived from. Instead they are updated, and watchable. <br/><br/>It's not a weighty movie -- just a lightweight look at a bygone era, and the things that happen when movies are being made, with familiar faces (although I challenge you to spot Frances McDormand) and funny jokes. I don't know what anyone else is saying about Channing Tatum, but I really liked his performance. And this guy Alden Ehrenreich -- whoa! He is just great. He has a gift for comedy and movie star good looks, and his character is *earnest* -- and likable. He is fun to watch. The secretary to Eddie Mannix, the studio head (presumably named after notorious MGM fixer Eddie Mannix) is a prominent character and she is compelling - she steals every scene, I think: Heather Goldenhersh! Today she'd be a producer, and I think the movie makers are making a poignant statement with her character.<br/><br/>Lots of cameos: ""Newman"" from ""Seinfeld,: David Krumholtz, Alison Pill from ""Newsroom,"" the stand-up comic from ""Mad Men"" -- really fun seeing so many familiar faces in unfamiliar roles.<br/><br/>I saw it in preview at Cinemark Egyptian in Hanover Maryland. I can't wait till it opens so I can see it again."
"moonspinner55","3","3","4","18 September 2017"," Self-amused pastiche
","Production head at fictional Capitol Pictures in 1950s Hollywood is forced to pay ransom on the star of his latest Roman Sandals epic after the perplexed actor is drugged and abducted by a Communist organization; meanwhile, production continues on a sailor musical, a water ballet (with a pregnant, unmarried starlet) and a black-and-white romance featuring the studio's number-one cowboy star out of his element. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, ""Hail, Caesar!"" gives off the impression of film school students running rampant with a huge bankroll. It's a well-produced, fast-paced comedy, but one that offers little more than select episodes reproduced from the movie-memories of two brothers who have watched a lot of TV, attended a lot of film retrospectives, who have the look and flip talk of the '50s classics down pat, but who possess such a dry sense of humor that they may be the only two laughing. Scarlett Johansson has a great bit in a mermaid's tail, Tilda Swinton is spot-on playing twin sister reporters who write competing entertainment columns, and Channing Tatum does a sweet Gene Kelly-like dance routine. Unfortunately, much of the ""plot"" concerns James Brolin and George Clooney, neither of whom finds their comic groove here. *1/2 from ****"
"gvzfs","3","3","4","5 March 2017"," Sooooo Commies Fly
","I don't get it. Pure and simple. There's a host of names and all are familiar faces their performances as taken from all their great films, and then nothing. The plot is hair thin. Giving no idea as to taking this even slightly serious or canning this as some artsy film that got the wrong attention and had to do better. I wonder as to the quality of the Coens,they have made such memorable films and are obviously tired of going the same path that leads to instant success. I see this as an example of extremely skilled Hollywood trying to do a spoof on itself and hitting some kind of internal censorship and then crippling itself from the first intent. The one thing that comes across as memorable are some lead-ins to a story that never get's any further explanation and the some lead-outs that never had a starting point. I like that ! Stories don't have to make sense. But the movie has got to obey it's own rules. The commy gay sailor can leap a long way and land securely, this is set up in a dancing scene and gets a payoff in the deflection to the submarine. Great ! But this is only happens once in the film and there isn't anything close to that again. The Cowboy lasso routine get's the same treatment without a rewarding payoff. Sorry Coen let's get into something more enticing next time."

There were so many opportunities for action, drama or humour and there was just nothing. So it scores nothing Dialogue: I do hope that this was not ad-libbed. Because then I would have to say that the actors got it seriously wrong. Let's just assume it was a the corny dialogue that made most of the stars look like they were phoning it in using autocue. There was one scene with a minster, a bishop a rabbi and an orthodox priest. again a target rich environment for humour.. and it was just flat.If there was any clever word-play I missed it And that sums up the whole film.

"brooks250","6","3","4","2 January 2017"," Another Bomb for the Coen Bros.
","I'm glad this one was on HBO because if I paid for it at a theater I'd be really unhappy (and, once again, disappointed at a Coen Bros. film). I'm not saying that a film cannot have a variety of tones and multi-layered themes. But at the end of the day, it must know what it wants to be overall: a comedy, a message movie, a thriller, a historical film, etc.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar is crammed full of A-list actors stuck in a failed concept of a movie. I can't say that the Coen Brothers are afraid to go for it, whatever ""it"" is. Sometimes their off-beat approach strikes gold as in Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo or O' Brother Where Art Thou. Then again, they have more than their fair share of black comedy (?) bombs such as Intolerable Cruelty, Burn After Reading and The Lady Killers. Well, sorry to say, add this Hail, Caesar to the bomb list and hope their next project is another gem like No Country for Good Men or True Grit."
"SnoopyStyle","5","3","4","21 September 2016"," Coen brothers' golden age of Hollywood
","It's Hollywood in the 50's. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer and producer at Capitol Pictures. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is the star of the studio's big Biblical production ""Hail, Caesar!"". He gets kidnapped by a communist cabal and held for ransom. Hobie Doyle is a singing cowboy put into a high class movie directed by Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is a twice-divorced starlet with a secret pregnancy. Twin sisters Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton) are rival gossip columnists. Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) is a song and dance actor. Various characters go through this unusual day as Eddie tries to fix the many problems.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers deliver a detailed, light, wacky portrayal of the golden age of Hollywood. While I like the fixer idea, Clooney may be a better actor for the role. I'm a little tired of Clooney playing dumb because it is broadly fake. Alden Ehrenreich is somewhat an unknown and a perfect fit for the singing cowboy. He's good. The communist cabal is problematic since the Coens obviously want it to be comedic. It doesn't work because it deals with something serious in a flippant way. The movie gets bogged down with too many things that want to be funny but aren't."

","I was hoping this would be another great Coen Brothers movie. Boy, was I disappointed. The cast is great, but the writing is abysmal. Johan Hill's part is so small he probably shot it in 30 minutes. <br/><br/>It was supposed to be a parody of 1940's and '50's Hollywood, but it couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to be a serious movie or a comedy. Mostly, it was just excruciating. <br/><br/>There were very few laughs and many plot points seemed incomplete. <br/><br/>Thank goodness I waited for this to come out on DVD and didn't waste my money seeing it in a theater. <br/><br/>I'm thinking waiting for any future Coen Brothers movies to come out on DVD might not be the worst idea."

Of course I should have remembered that not very often are movies with a large popular cast very good to begin with. That said, Hail Caesar had a few chuckle worthy moments, and was only slightly entertaining. Mostly though, there was too much going on that didn't seem to fit or make sense. Too many well known actors just thrown in and too many unnecessary undeveloped scenes that ultimately served little to no purpose.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole had no point, and I took nothing away from it, nothing but wasted time."
"luke-a-mcgowan","6","3","4","5 May 2016"," Its okay
","1. I have never loved the Coen brothers, and it amuses me that most people's problems with this film are the problems I've had with Fargo, The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men - character arcs wrap up off screen with no time to enjoy that they are there, and the focus of the film seems to be on one uninteresting aspect instead of a much greater potential.<br/><br/>2. Interestingly, I found this less with Hail, Caesar. The film's final ten minutes did a lot to improve my opinion of this film, linking the seemingly independent stories of Ralph Fiennes, George Clooney, Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum together to give a nice feeling that we saw a window of Eddie Mannix's life and that another window might show dozens of other things going on. I also enjoyed the emotional conclusion for Eddie regarding his future - it felt natural and satisfying after a movie in which we've seen him doing his job.<br/><br/>3. The film's trailer was misleading as hell. Enjoy the trailer as a two and a half minute short film, not as a teaser for the film because it will be a massive let down. As I've said, most characters have nothing to do with one another and you barely get to register and enjoy the presence of Ralph Fiennes before he's gone. All of his best moments are in the trailer. Every single one.<br/><br/>4. The film is also too long - this should've wrapped around the 90 minute mark. Most scenes involving Baird Whitlock and the communists who kidnap him are overly dialogue-heavy without being smart or witty. Each of those sequences is enough to put you in a slump of boredom. Ironically, the gag with Frances McDormand playing a buffoon editor wastes about three minutes of screen time. The film being edited together by that fictional character would explain a lot.<br/><br/>5. Of the acting performances, I really enjoyed Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix. It is not a flashy performance or even a memorable one, but he does a great job and I'm glad to see him headlining the cast. George Clooney is probably the most memorable as the loveably dopey leading man who is besotted by rumours from his early career and convinced of the virtues of Communism. Hearing him proudly and innocently explain his new worldview to an irritated Mannix is akin to watching Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld, and Mannix's short and direct response is probably the funniest part of the movie thanks to Clooney's expression.<br/><br/>6. Alden Ehrenreich is likely the star made by this film, as the polite Western star who cannot act in serious roles to save himself. He has great chemistry with everyone and nails each moment of the script as required. Scarlett Johannson is memorable in a small role, and its great to see Wayne Knight, Clancy Brown and Allison Pill getting work.<br/><br/>7. Roger Deakins' cinematography is a shining light in the film, especially Scarlett Johannson's glorious mermaid sequence. <br/><br/>8. The best directed segment of the film was the ""No Dames"" song and dance routine led by Channing Tatum. The choreography is flawless, the lyrics spot on and the cinematography fantastic. <br/><br/>9. It is a credit to Joel and Ethan Coen's script that things do flow together. There are a few Chekhov's guns throughout, characters who distract you with their presence only to reveal themselves as being more important at the end. There's also some witty banter - such as between Mannix and four church leaders regarding the depiction of Christ - although let's not hail it as perfect, because then we have to sit through those Communist scenes again.<br/><br/>10. I wasn't insulted by Hail, Caesar but after watching the trailer so many times I'd be lying if I said I was wholly satisfied."
"Dr_Coulardeau","7","3","4","12 April 2016"," Is Jesus a mermaid?
","A small film that makes fun of Hollywood and the modern world, though it speaks of the old times. Some scenes are funny though altogether this humor is slightly warped. <br/><br/>The western cowboy actor is funny and the scene of ""Lazy Ol' Moon"" is hilarious. And the song is so sad and nostalgic. He sounds like my Swedish friend City Cowboy singing Peter Pan (https://myspace.com/city- cowboy/music/songs) : nostalgia of the good old days when we were young, children, toddlers.<br/><br/>The kidnapping or abduction of the Roman legionnaire (Clooney) by some communists and his instant Stockholm syndrome is funny and the treatment of this PTSS by his boss at the studio is even more than funny since he is treated like a child with four slaps across the face. Which does not make him lose his Latin, but definitely makes him lose his faith.<br/><br/>The deeply superficial discussion of Jesus by four people, a rabbi, a Catholic priest, an Orthodox patriarch and what is going to be assumed to be a simple Protestant Joe Blow is absurd but so cut off from reality and from the real question about Jesus that we feel we have been dumped in some loony-bin. I just wonder why the children of Ismail, Abraham's first son, in other words the Arabs, in other words the Muslims have not been included. Or is that not kosher enough for the Coen Brothers?<br/><br/>The sudden conversion of the Roman Legionnaire to Christianity, though the actor has just been boxed over the ears by his boss and told to please do the only thing he is paid for, be a star, would have been convincing, nearly convincing, at best hypocritical, if he had not lost his faith. You see god exists and he is looking after us and the dumb things we may be doing or saying.<br/><br/>The Soviet submarine in Malibu is so unreal and all that happens then is so absurd that we wonder if the Coen brothers are laughing at the Russians, hence Putin, or the West, hence NATO and the USA. One thing is sure the red danger is quite a farce and the only danger we are running into is just forgotten. It is true Jesus dies at the 9th hour and he is buried at the 11th hour. Are the Coen brothers making fun of our fear in aftermath of 9/11 though we use 911 at any moment in the daytime and at night for any little trivial family affair or marital disagreement. <br/><br/>The Russian songs used in the film though are of course the Red Army's rendition of them, and I loved Kalinka that I taught in Russian to my French students and to my colleague's Spanish students in Dunn, North Carolina, in 1970. The Americans have always loved those popular and traditional Russian songs and the Red Army here is probably the only real, realistic and true note (for music it is the good word) in the film. Let's say authentic.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Eddie Mannix, head of a 1950s Hollywood studio, faces multiple problems – overwork, a female star with relationship and pregnancy issues, gossip columnists, communism, oh, and his big star being kidnapped in the middle of filming a biblical epic.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers write and direct this satirical comedy with a great cast, and masses of care given to historical detail. And, as is often the case with the Coens, I end up with a bad case of mixed feelings. My usual problem – the feeling that they are sitting in the row behind me, sniggering at in-jokes which I don't get – isn't the main problem here. The problem is that the disparate elements which go into making up this film – satire, knockabout comedy, affectionate tribute, multiple plot threads – are fairly successful individually, but never seem to knit together into a coherent whole. That's not to say that there isn't enjoyment here – the barely concealed homoeroticism in Channing Tatum's sailor dance number is a hoot, as is George Clooney's befuddled star – but none of the threads has a lot of point individually, Mannix' personal thread is tonally at odds with the other studio-based material, the communist writers' mix of commentary and comedy doesn't really work, and so on.<br/><br/>More than anything else, this film made me think of being served up with a plate containing muesli, curry, French fries, and pineapple ice cream – all things I love to eat, but they don't really work together to make a satisfying meal. Hail, Caesar! Is an ambitious attempt to squidge together a number of elements which don't really work when squidged together."

","It actually has happened. I watched a Coen-Brothers movie that I absolutely could not stand! ""Hail, Caesar"" is, without a doubt, one of the worst excuses ever for a movie. In actuality, it does not even come across as a complete movie, rather a bunch of vignettes that could not, under any given circumstances, be linked to form the same movie.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays Mannix, a Hollywood ""fixer""--i.e. he fixes any kind of problem(s) which may arise on the set of any movie. George Clooney plays Baird Whitlock, the star of the studio's upcoming blockbuster, ""Hail Caesar."" Seemingly despised by a good majority of the other actors who are under contract to this studio, he is drugged and kidnapped during the filming of this blockbuster. The rub here is he is kidnapped by communist Hollywood writers who lecture him on why they should share in all the profits any movie makes which have been penned by them. Yawn.<br/><br/>Many other stars are also in this movie, albeit for maybe one or two lines, or five minutes of screen time (tops). Scarlett Johanson, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton--just to name a few-- appear as various characters who appear nominally for the sake of filler. I did enjoy Tilda Swinton's dual role as gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker. The scene with Fiennes trying to get actual acting out of a hopeless cowboy reject simply went on for too long, thus removing any--and there wasn't much--comedy. I have no clue what/why Channing Tatum's character was all about.<br/><br/>I knew watching this was going to be a 50-50 chance considering it had not been all that long ago this movie had a major nationwide release, yet was now on On-Demand. Rated PG-13 for language, this was just awful."

","I suspect the folks behind this film wanted to make a ""Mel Brooks"" type film, but with too much making fun of religion and inside humor only progressive Hollyweird-types might condone, the film falls too flat to recommend as anything more than a doorstop the film canisters might make.<br/><br/>Too often in the past we have seen otherwise good actors involved as a means to lend a legitimacy to bad films. This is one of those. George Clooney may have done his part as a favor to somebody, I doubt it was out of boredom, and he certainly gained nothing from the film. For me, the ONLY redeeming value was the attempt to make a ""period piece"", which I love, but this is very, very far from making up the plethora of things the film lacked."

","Watched this film with no expectations, the trailers made this film look like it was designed for the awards, it looked like art film trying to be funny. So as most movie goers i stayed away from it in the cinema and only decided to watch when it came on Blu ray and DVD.<br/><br/>The film was extremely well directed and written, the Coen brother's did a great job on making a very solid film which was very entertaining, to bad they were not responsible for making a good trailer.<br/><br/>Anyways, lets get into the review. The film is about a Hollywood fixer in the 1950's whose job is to make sure the stars of the studio maintain face and an image with the media. He is responsible for getting them out of sticky situations and is also responsible for them being well behaved and rocking up on set. Brolin does a fantastic job! I really liked him in the film, he played his character brilliantly, making the audience believe that this film was really set in that era. He has that old look about him, just my opinion, as did Alden Ehrenreich, these two castings were great. For me the odd one out was Tatum, who just doesn't feel/ look like a 1950's actor type. Story of the film was good, and very light heartened for what it was trying to convey to the audience. As bunch of guys steal the studio's most valued actor and demanded a ransom for him, Eddie (Brolin) has to uncover what is going and bring back the super star before the media gets a hold of the situation and jeopardize the whole studio. Meanwhile the studio is still running and all of the actors, directors demands still need to be met. <br/><br/>Acting, for most part like i wrote above acting was really good. Apart from Tatum, he felt out of place. i feel instead of Tatum, Armie Hammer would have been a much better fit. If you see the film and have seen man from U.N.C.l.E you'll know why i'm referring to him. Apart from Brolin's performance, i think Alden did an amazing job, as did Christopher Lambert in his small role.<br/><br/>Overall this was a very enjoyable film. with more then few laughs to keep you entertained through out the course of the film."

","I'm not a huge Coen brothers film by any stretch although admittedly I did like"" Fargo"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"" but the simple fact is that 'Hail Caesar' is nothing more than muddled mess with absolutely no story line whatsoever. <br/><br/>What exactly was the point here of Whitlock's kidnapping? Same goes for a slut movie actress played by Scarlett Johansson getting pregnant and needing to 'find a husband'? Then of course there is Channing Tatum's being an alleged Communist and escaping back to the Soviet Union about a nuclear submarine??? All of this may appear to be spoilers but the fact is that the script is disjointed and frankly stupid when in point of a fact a parody of 1950's Hollywood could've been done SO much better. When you look at the talent in this film I think many of these actors want to be in a Coen brothers movie because they sense there is some prestige in it but overall many of them played the equivalent of cameo roles compared to Clooney and Brolin who the film is really centered around.<br/><br/>What is truly laughable is that people thought this was Academy Award material this year or even next and the fact is it's more fitting of a Razzie Award than anything else."

"Quinoa1984","8","12","26","5 February 2016"," Hail, Coens!
","Hail, Caesar! is one of those big, luscious, gorgeous odes to the Golden Age of Hollywood - a certain kind of Hollywood, at any rate - and it's a work that is both great and minor at the same time. It's probably so because of the central plot, the sort of spine of it, is just alright, while everything else around it - all of the moving parts and scenes of 'dreams' being created at Capital Pictures - is so wonderful and hysterically funny and perfectly timed (time and how to have to always check it, the inserts of Eddie Mannix's watch, being a running theme here by the way). It's the Coens making a movie that only they can make, and if the parts are greater than the whole, still, such awe-inspiring parts! Of course a lot is taken tongue-in-cheek, but there are some things underlying the story that are serious enough to get invested in the characters. <br/><br/>Or, I should say, the ""Christ"" hero of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) who runs the Physical Production arm of the shooting of films at Capital, with multiple shoots going on a particular day. On the 24 hours that Hail, Caesar takes place in, there's of course the ""prestige"" picture of the movie's own title (with the subtitle ""A Tale of the Christ"", an obvious wink and nod to Ben-Hur) where George Clooney as Baird Whitlock is hamming it up as a Roman in the face of this ""Christ"" figure. While Whitlock gets drugged and taken away to an underground group (that operates in a nice house in Malibu by the sea), other pictures go on like a mermaid/swimming-dance piece (with Scarlett Johansson), a cowboy picture - at first - but then in almost the blink of an eye the star of that, Hobie Doyle (Ehrenreich) gets put on a fashionable costume drama directed by Laurence Larentz (Fiennes). And of course there's a musical being shot with singing and dancing sailors led by Channing Tatum... because, how could you NOT have him doing that here? <br/><br/>I'm sure I've left out other shoots that may be taking place on the lot over the course of the day (and lets not forget, oh it's impossible to do so, Tilda Swinton as *twin* gossip columnists with only slightly varying agendas when talking separately to Mannix, and Frances McDormand in a brilliant one-scene bit as a chain-smoking editor), but those are the ones to really take in. Probably the one with Johannson comes close to being too long, but it's still a gorgeous, over-the-top spectacle that revels in how cheesy we look at works like that today if they pop up on Turner Classic Movies - same with the sailor musical or the costume drama (we also, very thankfully, get to see some dailies from these shoots that are so authentic and yet with that little sly wink the Coens do). In fact the whole movie, when it's at its best, is like condensing a week's worth of programming - both the ""B"" movie level and the prestige ""A"" stuff - into an hour and 45 minutes, with Tatum's dance number a mini-masterpiece that blends together being a rich satire of such goofy and dopey numbers and being a legitimately fantastic and spectacular number.<br/><br/>I enjoyed those parts so much that it pains me to not find the movie one of the directors' best on the whole. It may be seeing it a first time and having certain expectations (the trailer, one of the best in recent memory, does a number on any viewer), such as what ""The Future"" kidnapping group entails. Perhaps I expected it to have much darker, weirder, more absurdist/surrealist dimensions based on how they appeared. As it turns out, they're only Communists who try (and sort of succeed, in a way) to indoctrinate Whitlock into their world. Indeed the movie sort of functions as two stories, one with Whitlock and the old blacklisted writers and the other being Mannix having to go around from one place to another as the Man In Charge spinning a dozen different plates (and also his own conflicts at work, which is a nice bit of writing to make him have the most dimension, and Brolin plays it with total conviction and never slipping into caricature, which is easy enough to do here).<br/><br/>I can see this probably being a work that I will like even more a second time, or, equally, as with a film tonally this reminded me of from them, Burn After Reading, I find more to pick apart, but it's all the same a movie that you have to see in the theater to get the full experience of it. Even when it gets very, very strange (the climax involving ""The Future"" is that for me, among the strangest things the Coens have ever written and shot in their careers) it's still highly entertaining, and the actors are having a blast in all of their roles, including those who just appear in a scene or two (looking at you Jonah Hill, Clancy Brown or, yes, oh my God, that's Christopher Lambert!) The filmmakers lovingly recreate the period to every small detail, from the art design to Deakins' cinematography (a contrast to last year's Sicario by light years) and it's one of those grand old times where they just fill up the frames with sunny, light comedy with the occasional dark-noirish undertone. It's the Coens saying 'yeah, this was all pretty goofy... but wasn't it SOMETHING to behold?'"

","I am very savvy moviegoer and I am willing to take a chance on quirky offerings. However, this movie is underwritten, clichéd, under directed, and really, truly, deeply boring--which is something I never thought I'd say about a Cohen Brothers movie. It's all over the place. Each character is a one-joke card board cut out. Brilliant actors like Ralph Fiennes and Tatum Channing are severely underused. The plot does not hang together and Josh Brolin's character seems to meander through the plot; he's either underwritten as a character or badly acted by Brolin. Robert Altman made these send-up films in a much better way. I almost feel insulted that movie critics by and large loved this movie--but I think it's a clap trap of badly written and poorly acted essaylets that not only are not entertaining, but are actually boring. Sorry folks; I love film and I generally give the benefit of the doubt to almost everyone's efforts. However, I can share that I actually considered pulling out my phone and starting to play scrabble--I was that bored during this move. Sorry Clooney, you don't float my boat at all. Cohen Bros--go back to the drawing board and review what made Raising Arizona so refreshing."

","The classic studio era of Hollywood was really a glamorous time--full of movie magic and larger-than-life stars. But the man who was very much responsible for that image we've acquired over time was Hollywood fixer, Eddie Mannix. He kept the public from seeing the slime and dirt that went on behind the scenes.<br/><br/>As history goes, Mannix really existed, but for the sake of this film, the people and events around him are very much fictitious. <br/><br/>Taking place in the early 1950s, big time movie star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), is kidnapped amidst starring in the studio film Hail, Caesar! But that's just the main conflict. The overlying focus is on Mannix (Josh Brolin) and his responsibility in making sure he does his job right. From an illegitimately pregnant movie star to a homosexual rumor to a Communist threat, Mannix must keep the gossip columns away and put up a facade for the rest of society. <br/><br/>The film really is a great inside look at the backside of the film industry in those days. But it may only be appreciated if you know the context of the events taking place. The feel is authentic as it mimics classic cinema in its own right.<br/><br/>The sets may be impressive, but the film tries to cover too much ground in one sitting. Just like a typical Coen Brothers film, Hail, Caesar! will leave audiences sitting there debating the point. They tend to dance around what they want to say and get there very indirectly. It's filled with small comedic bits and a lot of extra stuff to help establish the universe.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive sequence is during one of the several films-in-a-film where Channing Tatum's character stars in a Gene Kelly-type picture, and there's a 5 minute tap-dance musical number. You'd almost wish you could watch an entire movie of just these types of moments. However, in this day and age, we'll have to settle for Hail, Caesar!<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 90"

They did 'O Brother, Where Art Thou', 'Internal Cruelty' and 'Burn After Reading'-some I liked and some I didn't. There are several story lines going on here or you could say, a movie within a movie. Josh plays a fixer at a big Hollywood movie company. A fixer fixes problems involving the movie companies' bread & butter, the stars-such as a star getting pregnant or one getting drunk or on pills, etc. Any kind of scandal, Josh smooths things over and keeps people out of the headlines. George is just such an actor-inept and disappearing for days at a time, getting drunk or ending up in a young girls' bed. George is starring in a biblical epic called 'Hail Caesar!' and now, someone goes and kidnaps him. Alden is another actor in a western movie, Channing is in a musical movie and Scarlett is in a water ballet movie. All their story lines are going on simultaneously and some are connected to each other, in varying degrees. There are lots of cameos going on; I remember seeing Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill and Christopher Lambert popping up here and there. But as a whole, the movie was a little jumbled. There were funny parts but it's not really a comedy. I guess I'm not a big fan of the Coen Brothers. For instance, a lot of people I talk to really loved 'O Brother Where Art Thou' and I did not care for it. Oh well, different strokes... It's rated ""PG-13"" for sexual content-no nudity-and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I would not rent it either.

There is not too much plot, but it's very very funny.<br/><br/>I really love watching movies (maybe too much) and I am a big fan of the Coen Brothers.

"galahad58-1","5","7","14","6 February 2016"," Hail! The Final Credits
","Hail, Caesar! could be rated as one of the biggest disappointments of 2016. This film is a mess. As you are watching the film you get the sense that the Coen brothers did not have a fully fleshed out main story so they had to add a lot of filler to achieve a full length feature. <br/><br/>The general idea is that Baird Whitlock is kidnapped and the studio has to ransom him to finish their film. You would get the idea that this is going to have some comedic edge on how the characters find Whitlock; that it is going to show how missing a star can effect a film; or some type of twisted outcome. Instead the story is focused on Josh Brolin (Eddie Mannix) and what he deals with on a daily basis. There is sub-story after sub-story that have nothing to do with the kidnapping. Most movies use those sub-stories to explain plots, backgrounds or build characterization - but these do absolutely nothing. The sub-stories (filler) are basically there to have cameos by stars with zero influence on the story or the plot outcome. <br/><br/>1-If you are a fan of Jonah Hill you have seen 90% of his entire performance by watching the trailer. There may be another 5 seconds of footage, but that is all. 2-The Scarlett Johansson character has nothing to do with the story at all. This was a filler to show what Mannix does in his daily life, but it is a useless couple of scenes. The trailer kind of hints that Johansson helps with the investigation, but she just plays a trashy actress who is dealing with being pregnant out of wedlock and not wanting her ""innocent"" image tarnished. To add to the filler, the film has a much longer than needed swim scene (ala the old 40's movies) that again has nothing to do with the story. 3-The dancing sailor scene is supposed to be funny, but it is long and drawn out and again has nothing to do with the story. Even Tatum's character (who turns out to be the main antagonist) does nothing in the film to show why the kidnapping happened or even how he is involved. You are just shown a scene with him on a boat with the conspirators - heading out to a submarine. There is no explanation - nothing. 4-The double Tilda Swinson reporters have no bearing on the story and (I believe) were supposed to be comic relief, but both characters are dull and uninspiring.<br/><br/>The only saving grace is that the character of Mannix is played well by Brolin and is likable enough to ride the storm out. Also, Clooney is likable as Whitlock. Without those two performances this rating would have been a 2 or a 3 because of how bad the script is, the random filler that hinders the movie, the lack of cohesiveness.<br/><br/>As I was leaving the theater, I came across a group of five people complaining about how they wasted money on ""the worse movie I have ever seen"". I stopped and asked ""Hail, Caesar?"" and they said ""yes"". I would not rate it as the worse that I have ever seen, but one of the biggest disappointments."
"zeynep-badur","10","5","9","17 May 2016"," Good does not equal ""edgy""

It was very nice tribute to all those movies I watched as a kid. It was like visiting movie moments, back to back. It gave the atmosphere of the time, without taking any side or being heavy handed about it. I am sure all those reviewers who criticized the film ""loooved"" Kill Bill movies,which were hailed as a tribute to a genre. So if you idolize horrible movies with a lot of blood, it is OK.

"lanierhunt","8","5","9","17 February 2016"," Hipsters, flipsters, finger-popping' daddies!
","Before the film started, I was subject to a series of trailers for films such as ""The Boss"" and ""Neighbors 2,"" which are both R-rated comedies with PG humor. Either the studios are really stupid, making films that contradict themselves, or really smart and understand the limited intellectual capacity of their modern adult audiences (it's the latter). ""Hail, Caesar!,"" rated PG-13, is what an adult comedy looks like, as it spotlights--as all Coen films do--the absurd whipping post of life, with which the cries of pain from every bloody crack of the whip turn steadily to laughter with time.<br/><br/>The heart behind the film's many flailing arms is Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). Mannix is the night watchman in the flamboyant insane asylum of Hollywood, dusting deviance under the couch to maintain the innocent image of the stars. The other two big players are Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), an airheaded household-name, and Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a simple-minded singing cowboy. Whitlock is kidnapped by a group of men of who talk a lot about book a called ""Capital,"" only it's spelled with a ""K,"" and Mannix must fetch him before the tabloids smell story.<br/><br/>The Coens are able to tap into the white noise of comedy, creating laughs from seemingly non-jokes. But at the same time, they don't forsake the classic ""set-up, punchline"" formula. For example, there's an incredible scene involving a meeting that Mannix has called, which involves a Protestant, a Catholic, an Eastern Orthodox and a Rabbi, all in order to get their blessing for a ""Ben-Hur""- esque film. There's a clear joke that the scene ends on--the Jewish guy has an opinion for everything but the thing that matters--but more than that, there's a religious satire, in that nearly every question asked of the clergyman receives a ""yes and no"" response. The Coens are masters of gags within larger gags within larger gags. And of course, there's no shortage of prolonged awkward silences and dumb faces, trademarks of any Coen film.<br/><br/>Despite the film's marketing, Mannix is the focus and to a lesser extent, Whitlock and Doyle. For the most part, Clooney's restricted to funny faces, though he nails the scene where he's relating everything he's learned from the Communists to Mannix, like a child eagerly telling his father what he's learned at school that day. Ehrenreich stands out as the Roy Rogers-like Doyle, especially in a scene involving a spaghetti lasso, reminiscent of Chaplin's bread roll dance. <br/><br/>Each of the other headliners get a one-joke character, which would be worse if the jokes didn't work, or if more weight were put on them. Ralph Fiennes plays a pretentious, English director, Laurence Laurentz, a man of dual-pronunciations. Scarlett Johansson is DeeAnna Moran, a chain-smoking, man-eater in reality; a naive, angelic blonde on the silver screen. Channing Tatum is Burt Gerney, a player in a homoerotic musical, who just so happens to be--in a delightfully insane reveal--the realization of 'McCarthyism paranoia.<br/><br/>Mannix, however, doesn't seem to be in a zany comedy. He feels more like something out of ""Barton Fink,"" ""A Serious Man,"" or ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" Like the main characters of those films, Mannix is miserable, but--unlike those characters--he learns to love the misery, seeing it as a side-effect of doing something worthwhile, rather than unjustified punishment.<br/><br/>""Is it wrong to do the easy thing?"" Mannix asks a priest. To Mannix, the answer is yes. To the priest, the answer is yes and no. To me, the answer is yes; keep making movies."
"RLTerry1","10","12","29","5 February 2016"," A brilliant post-war self-reflexive commentary on the Hollywood studio system.
","Go inside classic showbiz! Before the decentralization of ""Hollywood"" filmmaking, the big studio was king. And Hail, Caesar captures the socio-economic mountains and pitfalls of the decline of the Golden Age of Hollywood perfectly, complete with a pure message about love, dedication, and highbrow humor along the way. You couldn't have asked for a better cast. From the excellent writing to the impeccable acting, this film is sure to provide you with old-school style entertainment paired with plenty of topics of discussion–especially for cinema scholars and historians like myself. Return to the Hollywood that still inspires dreamers today and experience life in the studio system. This is one of the best self-reflexive films about Hollywood itself since Singin' in the Rain. Although, the social-commentary is more or less a plot device that plays in the background while the main plot is the true focus of this exceptional narrative. Truly a remarkable film that will likely find its way into sociology and film studies classes alike.<br/><br/>Where to begin?!? As a peer-reviewed published cinema (and themed entertainment) scholar and historian, there are are so many different ways of applying a critical analysis to this film. Leaving the cinema last night, I was perplexed as to how to write about it. Ordinarily, I have a general idea of the direction I will head in my review by the time the credits roll–not this time. There is definitely a subplot in the movie that would be great material to dissect and analyze but I don't want to spoil that for you; although, I can say that is is very apropos for that period in 1940s/50s Hollywood.<br/><br/>In order to analyze the material that I found most interesting, I want to first spend a moment on the film itself. Even before watching it, you already know that it boasts a brilliant cast and thankfully everyone lives up to the expectation that comes with their respective talent. From the leading players down to the A list cameo appearances, all the actors bring a unique flavor to the overall recipe of the movie. One of the elements that stands out the most is the attention to detail in the classic Hollywood production design. Essentially, we are watching a movie containing the making of another movie. The matte backdrops and traditional rear projection doesn't stop in the story of the film being made in Hail, Caesar, but the classic production styles and designs cross over into the production of the Hail, Caesar itself. From the color schemes to the wardrobe and makeup, the attention to detail is flawless. Although much more humorous and satirical than the epitome of self-reflexive post-war Hollywood films, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, Hail, Caesar does a superb job of going inside the word of showbiz and highlighting positive and negative consequences of the former studio system.<br/><br/>The film opens up with Mannix pulling DeeAnna (Scarlett Johansson) from an unauthorized photoshoot because the image the studio has of her could be tainted. That is really the first glimpse into what it was like for stars who worked in the Hollywood Studio System. Not limited to the talent, Mannix even told directors who would star in the pictures that they were hired to direct. Capital Pictures even pulled a cowboy off his motion picture to then star in a drawing room comedy. When you worked for the studio, you worked FOR the studio. From your image to the projects you worked on (whether talent or technical crew), your every move was managed by the studio heads. Sounds like the perfect setup for exploitation, doesn't it? In many ways, yes. However, the studio system also provided a central hub for working in motion pictures. One of the scenes show Mannix walking down a corridor of editing offices, and that is something that isn't quite the same today. Studios has exponentially more staff until the final collapse of the studio system in the late 1950s/early 1960s. You had a regular job Monday-Friday and were typically on a salary. Yes, many aspects of your career were managed–even down to you accompanied you to the premiere of the film you either worked or starred in. But, many more people were employed by the studio directly than today. Just something to think about.<br/><br/>The studio is aptly named Capital Pictures. And rightly so, because at the heart of the movie, the two-fold plot of the film contains socio-economic commentary. The counterpart to the socio- economic side is about being dedicated to one's true passions. Mannix can easily represent anyone who has a job that they work hard at and are dedicated to but often drawn to opportunities that would be easier and make more money. Do you choose to follow your passion? Or, do you choose the easy way out that would be more profitable? You will have to see the movie in order to discover how Mannix dealt with that real-world conundrum. Although the story of the passion of Christ is a backdrop in the film, it actually plays quite an important role near the end of the third act. The message of love transcends the screenplay (being shot in the movie) and impacts the actors and studio leadership. There is so many wonderful elements to discuss in Hail, Caesar and I have just touched on a few of them. I encourage you to make your way to the cinema this weekend in order to experience it for yourself."

","The latest movie from the Coen brothers 'Hail, Caesar!' is another Hollywood invention that may resonate with some, for reasons that I still don't understand to this day. It originally appeared to appeal to a broad swath of moviegoers before its release, due in part to a strong marketing campaign. So, just like many moviegoers convinced by the ads, I decided to watch the latest inventions of the Brothers. To my dismay, the movie did not waste any time to mockingly dismiss the artistry and cultural legacy of the golden age of Hollywood. So, it is natural to try to understand the underlying motivation for a movie that had so much potential, but so incoherent that only those with unique sensibilities could enjoy and laugh from time to time. It is indeed hard to agree with New York Times' film critic Manohla Dargis, who believes the script was ""written to amuse only the Coens and the Turner Classic Movies (TCM) crowd."" Perhaps she watched a different version of the movie before she wrote her favorable review. Perhaps her perception of what moves and delights the TCM crowd is up for revision as well.<br/><br/>The movie tries rather unsuccessfully to showcase the different vices and nonsensical nature of the Hollywood's of the 1950s. Oddly enough, 'Hail, Caesar!' implodes on itself by all the nonsensical silliness packed in almost 2 hours, which few can understand, appreciate and enjoy. If you think the movie falls in the category of wise and insightful entertainment, you will certainly be disappointed. The whole plot is disjointed, so the only thing that one can do is to try to laugh from all the silliness and pointlessness taking place in each scene. Also, moviegoers should write letters to the Coen brothers to remind them that movies need an ending.<br/><br/>At a deeper level, the movie tries to indict the Hollywood's past for its political correctness, without taking the time to explore and understand the cultural and social underpinnings of its time. Luckily, the movie will soon fall into the category of cult following, in which ideas are only rehashed and regurgitated among those with no desire to see beyond the horizon."

It also helps if you have ever been an extra, which mostly consists of hurry up and wait.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin has turned into a wonderful chameleon-like character actor.

Tilda Swinton is perfectly cast as twin sister gossip columnists, standing in for Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons.<br/><br/>George Clooney does one of his marvelous clueless roles, and gets to show off his excellent legs since he's in centurion costume for the whole thing, pesky gladius and all.

The Coen brothers approach Cinema-making as an art. Ethan Coen read Wittgenstein in college and you won't really appreciate the depth of their art unless you take the effort to see the integration of structuralism, neomodernism and the wit of the traditional Yiddish Theater which gave birth to the Marx and the Ritz brothers.<br/><br/>Don't take my word for it.

I kept waiting for something to break the film into a captivating entertainment piece and was surprised when the ending titles came up. A positive was the retro 50's cars and clothing. The rest of the film was a disaster for entertainment. I'm very surprised so many main line stars chose to be in the film. I'm not sure the accuracy of the studio sets. My interest in films is usually action packed, keeping me on the edge of my seat. I fully expected to be entertained in a different way, thru drama or comedy, certainly not mystery, however none of these came thru in my estimation. Clooney has made some good/great films and why he chose to do this one is beyond me. Must have been paid a lot of money for the short on-screen time that he had. The same for Ralph Fienes. My value to the film is very liberal."
"derpyraco","8","3","5","17 April 2016"," Rather good new Coen Brothers movie
","Hearing about this movie I was instantly going to see it. The whole plot is very good. The main plot summed up is a big time Hollywood actor from the 1950s gets kidnapped by some Communists. My favorite actor in the whole film was definitely Geroge Cloony. All the characters had great chemistry with each other and made for an even better movie. One of my favorite aspects of the movie is (Spolier) Channing Tatums character as the Communists leader. If you like movies that have movies inside of movies then you will love this film. Anthor one of my favorite actors in this movie was Josh Brolin. His character was very intriguing and determined to find Geroge Cloony. I really liked this film. I would definitely recommend this movie. I would give it an 8/10 79% and a B+."

","I did not find this movie funny at all, how can this be called a comedy. It is well made, I'll give them credit for that, the acting is good, but it's not a comedy, it's more like a drama, with a little bit of a musical number in the mix. It's not a very serious drama, but it's not not at all a comedy. I enjoyed the trailer, and I was really looking forward to watching this movie, but after the first 30 minutes, I couldn't wait for it to finish. I was constantly checking the time, just waiting for it to end. Like I mentioned before, the acting is good. The story is mediocre. Not worth your money, don't waste your time watching this movie, it is NOT funny."

","I was really disappointed in this Coen brothers film. I guess you can't always make great films.<br/><br/>Perhaps the following analogy will sum up my feelings best. Let's say you where given a beautiful bottle of Dom Perignon, and knowing its reputation you are expecting the best thing you will ever taste. You wait for that special moment to share it with a loved one, spend a lot of money in the preparation prior to opening it... and then you pop the cork... but to no pop... it's just awfully flat.<br/><br/>This film with all its stars should have been a warning. Big cast films usually are disappointing. The film was really all about appearance. They could even win an Oscar for best time period costumes, but the script was uninteresting, flat and with no substance. Did the Coen brothers really make this film? The only scene I enjoyed was with Ralph Fiennes as a director. Man, this film was not even to the level of a Hollywood ""B"" movie... I would call it a ""D"" movie."
"ThePlagueLegion","8","3","5","9 March 2016"," Intelligent, Witty, Honest - Yet possibly unappealing.
","The Coen Brothers are incredible, simply put. You can call them overrated, you can call them too artsy, you can call them bizarre; call them whatever you like, but they are some damn fine film makers. They give interesting, original insights to film, and always put effort into their work.<br/><br/>A lot of the gags of the film, however, rely a bit on knowledge of the glory days of '40s-'50s cinema, which brings me to the film's biggest issue; some people will not find it funny. This is simply because some people will not have enough of an understanding of the comedy, or it simply wouldn't be their cup of tea. The main source of laughs is the satire and almost spoof-like riffs on post-WW2 cinema, with spoofs of over-the-top westerns and synchronized swimming sequences, as well as soppy melodramas and espionage spy films. <br/><br/>The cast is great - particularly George Clooney as the dim-witted actor Baird Whitlock and Josh Brolin as tough guy ""fixer"" Eddie Mannix. Alden Ehrenreich's role is a nice addition to the film's great cast. He brings a young, fresh faced charm and charisma to his role,while Ralph Fiennes and Scarlett Johannson are hilarious in their side-character roles. However,some of the other roles, such as those from Jonah Hill and Tilda Swinton, are in glorified cameos that were prominently featured in marketing for the film. I can see many being upset that the actors and actresses in said roles were given only a few minutes of screen time. <br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is a solid, thought-provoking offering from the Coen Brothers. It benefits from a strong cast, consistent laughs and snappy writing. However, it is slightly undermined by an occasionally jumbled plot structure, and a possibly unappealing comedic style. <br/><br/>Morally speaking, Hail, Caesar! is a tale of humans attempting and sometimes failing to do the right thing, while also trying to make themselves better. It's this timeless, empathetic theme that makes Hail, Caesar! a worthy inclusion to The Coen Brothers' already- stacked arsenal of filmography.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10 - Worth-While Watch"

","In a time when we are deeply concerned about wasting the resources of mother earth, this movie wastes everything, including almost 2 hours of my life. I am a simple man, that likes simple things and I generally take people at their word. So when I saw the professional reviews for this flick were ~85% positive, I thought well, this will be a good flick for the wife and I to watch on movie night. <br/><br/>I was wrong, they (the professional critics/hacks) were wrong. The wife made it about 45 minutes before deciding to go upstairs and do some work on her laptop. Yes, the movie is indeed so bad that she chose to do some work on a Saturday night rather than watch the movie. She is usually much more patient but I am more stubborn so sometimes I'll watch the whole movie no matter how bad just to I can feel more like a victim. And that is exactly what I am this movie victimized me and brutalized me- Not in swift way but sort of a long term painful assault. <br/><br/>The only half way decent part of the flick is the part where they try to get Hobie to say his line properly. <br/><br/>So please explain to me how is it that two famous directors the Coen Bros.and several huge movie stars can all conspire together to make such a horrible picture? I am generally not a big environmentalist but this movie made me wonder how is our planet any better for this movie? It can't be any better and it is certainly worse off. <br/><br/>Think of the poor dinosaurs that gave their lives for the fuel to power this massive abortion of a movie. I am not a brilliant man nor a I a dullard and I cannot for the life of me figure out what they were trying to achieve with this garbage. I makes me wonder if the Coen Bros. called up Clooney and the rest of the numpties and said hey- lets all get together, we'll party for a few weeks, have a good time and make some money off of it. We can do a movie so the extras, the people who work on the set, the critics etc can have a pay day and we'll be getting one over on the populace. <br/><br/>I cannot imagine anyone involved in this movie sitting at home one night, looking back over their life and thinking yep that was an honest day's work for an honest day's pay- IP am proud of my effort. <br/><br/>This movie stands for what Hollywood has become. A bunch of self serving artists who prance around in make up all day pretending to be other people. As I write, this I am reminded that movie stars like Clooney, make enormous amounts of money running around in action movies pretending to do things that are similar to what some of us have done in real life. Aside from the danger the biggest difference is they make a ton of money pretending to live the rough life when in reality they can't wait to get home to their fancy digs and complain about world events. <br/><br/>But I digress- essentially this movie is horrible- if you are one of those pretentious people that lives to go to an art gallery and pretend like the artwork in front of you is ground breaking or even worse if you are in real life like the pseudo intellectuals that kidnaps Clooney's character you may like this movie. For the rest of us, just regular people who have simple 'asks' when it comes to a movie- things like being entertained, informed or just plain old escapism you are going to hate it. And you should because this movie is horrible. REALLY bad- pointless and I can't help but think they are playing a joke on people- they make a movie like this and then laugh at the fools who praise it. Hey George, did you see so and so from the Daily Whatever- said, your portrayal was soulful and full of charm? Yeah man I saw that- that guy is an idiot isn't he? Or maybe it is the critics who give it rave reviews that sit back and laugh at us for yet again falling for their garbage.<br/><br/>PS if you saw the movie my review may remind you of it- a bunch of unrelated thoughts and ideas that really don't flow well and seem to be more like a ship lost at seas than a real review- yeah I did it on purpose."

"TastesLikeChicken3","2","4","8","5 March 2016"," Disappointed.
","The first thing to point out is that Hail, Caesar! does not grab you by the nuts and hold you there; it comes across as completely bipolar. I didn't hold out too many high expectations (I don't think) as despite hearing that it was ""the best comedy of the year"", I hadn't actually seen a trailer of it and just went out on a whim to go watch it.<br/><br/>The film itself just feels jittery and all over the place. It feels like there is no clear plot; it's 13% actual narrative and 87% filler. It comes across as though someone had this cool idea for a film, but then realised that it needed padding out for it to be feature-length. It continuously cut from the main plot of the film to show snippets from films that the studio was creating - this didn't really add anything to the story development other than showing the audience that it was a working, functioning film studio. I personally found that it detracted from the film because of the pure amount of them and the random/sporadic placement of them became disorienting - it made it difficult to follow what should have been a clear and concise narrative.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt as though I never saw any real form of character development nor experienced any connection with a character on screen as it felt like they had to fight just to get a couple of minutes worth of screen time. I honestly think this would have went down better if they cut out all of the unnecessary characters because that way, it would be more streamlined and less for the viewer to keep track of; plus, if only those characters that aided the development would have been featured, it would have cut down on the confusion as to who is who.<br/><br/>The film garnered no laughs in the auditorium, except for a stifled snigger here and there. The only thing that did make me chuckle was when I heard a grown man behind me go ""Ooh, Mr Channing Tatum!"" as he came on screen in his slightly tight sailors outfit. I was in the mood as to where I really wanted to laugh and enjoy the film; I was on the edge of my seat just waiting for the punchline, something to come out of the blue and just slap me silly, but unfortunately, that never happened. To me, it felt like one of the films that tried to be edgy and cool, but failed miserably. It felt like the writers and actors bounced off one another, where they had so much fun and created so many beautiful memories whilst creating this film that it gave them this weird sort of comical sentiment towards it to the point where they must have thought it was hilarious watching it back in the editing room, but the thing with that is, the audience doesn't hold these sentiments or values - an inside joke, if you will.<br/><br/>To conclude, I feel like the only way to enjoy this film is to take a rather large handful of narcotics before viewing. Actually, I guess you could say it was that best comedy of the year - it was so bad that it was almost laughable."

The trailers did a good job of not giving away too much of the story and I really had no idea what I was going to see when I stepped into the theater. That being said, it was not expecting what I got.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is, more than anything, a slice of life film from the golden age of Hollywood. The experience was wonderfully enjoyable and gave a fun look into how films were made in the 50's.

","I Can't say I hated this movie, but I can say that anything that could've told a cohesive narrative was incredibly neglected. This was such a dull, unfocused mess of a film. It's a film that's advertised as a comedy, mystery romp with lots of stuff happening. And while stuff does happen, it's not interesting enough to be called a romp. Instead of it being a plot driven laugh-fest, it's more like a series of vignettes that are loosely tied to a movie star's kidnapping by communists. You'd think the movie would be about getting him back, well it is. kinda. Except it's buried underneath one dimensional sleuthing, searching for God, uninteresting as well as unfunny detours from the plot. <br/><br/>I mean dang, fir as many stories as this movie is trying to 'tell' it sure does a crud job of bringing any of them to any sort of conclusion. <br/><br/>The Many Stories of Hail Caesar include: Ralph Fiennes trying to teach a Western Actor how to say a line Scarlett Johanneson struggling to get remarried following her recent pregnancy A Gossip Columnist and Her Twin Sister Battling Over the Same Story (Sounds Interesting Rught, Well it really isn't. Cause none of these plots ever get a proper conclusion. They just come and go.) Which for an ensemble cast is not good. Ralph Fiennes is only in the movie for five minutes, Jonah Hill only has like four lines. Even Joel's wife has a Stan Lee type cameo in this. <br/><br/>I don't know what else to say but in a nutshell; Hail Caesar doesn't know what it wants to be, gets ADD'd into random vignettes that have nothing to do with anything, isn't funny, and honestly kinda sucks.<br/><br/>Not the Coen's Best."

I did expect to be entertained and this lacked that. If this was supposed to be a dry comedy, it wasn't even that. The ending left me thinking what was this movie about in the first place?

Despite being disappointed with several Coen Brothers movies in the past (O Brother, Where Art Thou? , Burn After Reading, etc), the high ratings of ""Hail, Caesar!"" convinced me to give them one more shot. Sadly it finally confirmed once and for all that I'll never enjoy their movies. Super slow pace, weird story, and insanely random scenes/cameos with some rather high profile Hollywood actors. By the halfway point I honestly just wanted it to end. The musical number with Channing Tatum was sort of entertaining I guess, the oddball character Hobie had a certain charm to him, and the 1950s setting was a nice spin... but overall this movie just didn't do it for me.

That happened with Loretta Young's baby with Clark Gable in order to protect Loretta's image. Josh Brolin's character was an excellent addition. Loved that decision and his portrayal. The narrator was perfect as well - straight from the era. <br/><br/>I don't know that younger viewers will find this film very enjoyable unless they are serious popular entertainment buffs of the era.

His character, along with his relevance to the story, is pushed aside by musical and epic film scenes. These all feature a tongue in cheek and a wink at the audience, but you may feel that wink is probably aimed at someone else... who might also feel the same way.<br/><br/>Simply put, the satire is toothless, because it doesn't have a relevant target in this day and age.

"Turfseer","5","2","3","7 August 2016"," Excellent Production Design can't save Coen Brother's weak satire on early 50s Hollywood studio system
","For those who have read my reviews, you can see I am not a big fan of the Coen Brothers. Yes, their production design is usually impeccable and for the most part they manage to cull fairly respectable performances from their actors. But they inevitably fall down in the area of screen writing and ""Hail, Caesar!,"" their most recent take on the early 50s Hollywood heyday and Biblical epics, is no exception.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is pretty much a one-joke idea. The main plot revolves around the protagonist, Eddie Mannix, based on a real character of the same name, solidly played by Josh Brolin. Mannix is a ""fixer"" for the fictional Capitol Pictures, charged with ensuring everything runs smoothly on the studio lot. <br/><br/>When Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), star of the studio's main production, Hail, Caesar! (a poor man's ""Ben Hur""), is kidnapped, Mannix meets a ransom demand of $100,000 by requesting ""petty cash"" from the accounting department. We soon find out that Whitlock has been kidnapped by a group of blacklisted Hollywood screenwriters who are depicted as a Communist cell.<br/><br/>Unlike Trumbo, a recent biographical film about the noted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo which depicted blacklisted screenwriters as victims of a Congressional witch hunt, here the Coens throw political correctness to the wind and present the screenwriters not only as a traitorous bunch but also as a coterie of bumbling fools. Ironically, according to Ronald Radosh, in his article ""Will the New Trumbo Movie Rehash Old Myths?"", Trumbo stated late in his career that his ""fellow Red screenwriters failed to get work not because they were Reds, but because they were ""mediocrities."" The Coens appear to echo Trumbo's sentiments. <br/><br/>There's some mildly amusing stuff here when Whitlock is depicted as being charmed by the screenwriters, who have fallen under the spell of a crotchety old professor who spouts the party line. And later on, after Whitlock is rescued, Mannix slaps some ""sense"" into him for allowing himself to be seduced by the ""dreaded"" Communist writers. The climactic ""crisis"" scene at the end of the second act also highlights the group's ineptitude, when one of the studio's actors, intending to defect, boards a Russian submarine, but accidentally drops the bag containing the ransom into the ocean, after his dog jumps into his arms. But the scene with the writers goes on for much too long and the jokes (elucidated above) tend to get lost in all the excessive verbiage.<br/><br/>Another example of a joke that goes on for too long involves the sub-plot featuring the studio's Cowboy star, Hobie Doyle. Alden Ehrenreich is actually quite good in the role of a country crooner who's ordered by the studio to act in a period drama directed by the classically trained Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Laurentz attempts to have Doyle speak in a highly refined accent but after many takes, Doyle cannot escape from his ingrained Country-Western twang. The problem here are the many ""takes"" that the Coens believe are hilarious but in reality become tiresome.<br/><br/>The rest of the narrative in part features the Coens' satirizing some of the big Hollywood musical production numbers. Scarlett Johansson briefly shows up as DeeAnna Moran, an Esther Williams-like synchronized swimmer beset with an out of wedlock situation which Mannix must come in and ""fix."" This allows Jonah Hill to step forward in a brief cameo as an accountant who protects Moran's reputation by ultimately marrying her.<br/><br/>Tatum Channing also does nicely as Burt Gurney, a Gene Kelly-like sailor, dancing up a storm in the Coens' homage to big movie musicals like ""On the Town."" Gurney is later revealed as the actor who defects to the Russians.<br/><br/>Also of note is Tilda Swinton, playing identical twin gossip columnists based on the rivalry between Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. Frances McDormand also gets in the act as a chain-smoking film editor, who is almost strangled by an errant roll of celluloid that gets accidentally wrapped around her neck while frantically doing her job.<br/><br/>In the end, the Coens' main plot simply is not clever or developed enough to sustain an entire feature. Instead, the sub-plots end up being more interesting to look at due to some more dynamic visual elements. Count on the Coens to deliver when it comes to production design—but only count on a few intermittent chuckles here and there, when it comes to the dialogue and story line."
"ahassan-12342","4","2","3","2 August 2016"," Dull sketch show masquerading as a film
","It's a bit of a myth that film critics and the average cinema-goer disagree almost every time on how good a film is. The scores on aggregate sites such as Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic demonstrates that there is a clear correlation between the ratings of film critics and those of the sites users in general. However Hail, Caesar! is one of the few films to have bucked the trend. While the Rotten Tomatoes' critics score hovers in the mid 80% range, the site's users have rated it below 50%. Here on IMDb, the average rating is a pretty average 6.4/10. I suspect with its in-jokes that it is a film which speaks to the avid cinephile, but leaves most feeling cold and a little bored.<br/><br/>Set in 1950s Hollywood, film studio executive and fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) has the job of keeping the Hollywood stars out of controversy. However, once the news that Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has disappeared, Mannix has to deal with his Communist kidnappers while ensuring that the tabloids don't get wind of what's going on. He also has to maintain good relations with unhappy director - played excellently by Ralph Fiennes - who becomes increasingly frustrated working with a talentless actor.<br/><br/>The latter character - an actor who cannot act - is played expertly and with nuisance by Alden Ehrenreich. The rest of the film never really comes together, with one getting the impression that the movie consists of a string of sketches rather than a coherent arc. There are a few laughs, the round-table discussion about the nature of the Trinity between Mannix, a priest and a rabbi a highlight. However, the handful of chuckles are not enough to overcome this dull affair."

","The Cohen Brothers new film Hail Caesar is a visually stunning recreation of 1950's movie studios and the films they made. This film is a good homage done in Cohen Brothers fashion... But something just didn't sit right with this one. It's a good film, there's just more that could have been done and I felt something was missing.<br/><br/>To start the acting was great. Josh Brolin and Alden Ehrenreich are great in the film. Everyone else don't really get much screen time excluding George Clooney of course. The rest of the acting was fine, nothing outstanding or terrible but then again there wasn't much screen time for some so its hard to judge.<br/><br/>I liked the political and religious elements of the film, with Capitalism vs Communism world and capitalist business the movie industry was at the time. The studio name was a nice touch to reinforce the political conflict.<br/><br/>The religious nature of Hail Caesar (movie within this movie) would lead to a rather interesting confrontation between different religions on how Jesus should be portrayed, this was good and was amusing especially when going off at a tangent, poking fun at the logic of movies which is always fun. I did however fail to see the purpose of Josh Brolin's confessions and religious opinion on the grand scheme of things, but it did reveal about his character quite nicely, presenting a rather likable person whose job has him worrying over 101 things at once, even a kidnapping. But the first thing he tells the father is that he smoked a cigarette when he promised his wife he'd quit.<br/><br/>My problem I think with this film was the events that unfold. The kidnap was almost forgotten about and didn't really conclude rather well. I would have preferred if the kidnap was given a bit more attention and doesn't end in the communists leaving George unguarded so he can simply leave. I know the film is about the many problems the studio head/ fixer has to deal with and the importance of image and keeping them up, but the film was advertised as a ransom kidnap film and was not really.<br/><br/>Overall Hail Caesar is an alright film. Alright by the Cohen Brothers Standards. Not their best or worst. But it was a good homage to 50's cinema with the Cohen's mark on it. The story and plot could have been tackled better or done differently but other than that its fine."

Confidential, I love you, but I'm looking right at you), this film is extremely enjoyable, especially if you grew up with parents who recorded everything they could on VHS (commercials and all)."
"tabuno","8","1","1","17 April 2020"," Stands Out For Its Detailed Period Setting and Almost Too Many Moving Parts Made Whole
","Definitely an Ethan Coen and Joel Coen production, who both directed and wrote the movie. This sparkling period-in-detail movie captures the retro-film pizzazz of the song and dance era as the backdrop to this mild in tone but sharply choreographed thriller comedy drama. The movie introduces a disparate number of song and dance routines that richly envelopes those film scenes along with the stage setting and handlers in which they were shot. At the same time, the narrator proceeds to move the main storyline of the insidious Cold War behind the scenes along with a setting up but never coming directly into blacklisting of movie industry employees. Yet all this is achieved with a serious but light-handed approach, never smartly becoming a parody, one of the most difficult of balancing acts in directing. Josh Brolin's character as a movie mogul in a well-acted performance almost breaks the flowing, entertaining tone of the movie at one point and having to literally repent at another point. There are almost too many moving parts to compress into one movie and perhaps some of the individual storylines and characters get short-shrifted or short-changed for the emotional and substantive depth they individually deserved unlike Pulp Fiction (1994) or Sin City (2005). Nevertheless, the Coen Brothers apparently pulled off a delightful and rather unique theatrical experience that allows this movie to stand out among many."
"Criticalstaff","8","1","1","15 April 2020"," A love-letter to 50s Hollywood
","This movie is a beautiful and sarcastic homage to 1950s Hollywood.
However, it still very much a farce, Coen Bros. style. In the same vein as Big Lebowski, the Hudsucker Proxy, or Burn after Reading this film is blatantly about style and visuals more than substance. And of course the movie acknowledge it itself!<br/><br/>There not a lot left to discuss. The story is the weakest element and used more as an excuse to jump from one (scene) film to the other. The style of 50s movie making, is replicated and made fun of. Deconstructed if you will, but not in an accusatory way, but with respect and with, of course, always a quirky twist. I cannot help to think that there is some kind of a meta joke about spending all this time and effort for these brilliant scenes that have no narrative justification, like the sailors dance, or the Would That It Were So Simple scene. They are well-made moments. And they are really funny.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful, and the humour is very good. The music is cool. It is a love-letter to 1950s and for that it work very well. The farcical and ridiculous elements work because they are made with affection. The movie is not mocking its subject, nor the religious faith, nor communism. It is using them to tell jokes. And that is why this movie is so good.<br/><br/>My only negative is that it could be more focused, and cleaner on the narrative side of things. Again it does not take away from the rest of the movie. But when you compare them to prior film the Coen bros have done, it feels emptier. The movie is great, I get it the 50s had all the genres: naïve westerns, dancing sailors, swimming sirens, sword-and-sandal epics etc... But nothing really happens in this movie. (Expect maybe Channing Tatum defects to the Soviets but he is not a major character). So you are left wanting more.<br/><br/>It came out very closely to two movies having very similar themes and at least settings : Trumbo and Café Society. I believe that watching these three movies you will get the complete idea of the 1950s in Hollywood. And as it happens they all lack something the other has. Trumbo has the true story and actual behind the scenes walk-through, CS has the drama and plastique and Hail Caesar has the spectacle and humour (throw in LA Confidential and you'll also have the thrilling action)."

","Great fun. But despite lovingly recreating Hollywood as it looked in the early fifties (along with its movies, although 'Merrily We Dance' looked more thirties) and knowing references to the likes of Norman Taurog, people who would know who Norman Taurog was would soon find themselves set adrift by the general vagueness of the personalities pastiched (possibly to forestall litigation by the next of kin of the real life models).<br/><br/>Naming the main character 'Eddie Mannix' (a name that still to me conjures up the early seventies TV series with Mike Connors) is at odds with generally using aliases; but was it caution or simple sloppiness that made the name on his office door 'Edward Mannix' when the real Mannix was actually 'Edgar'?"
"Medialawman","5","1","1","4 December 2019"," Hail, Caesar! by Wayne J. Keeley
","You expect certain things from established filmmakers. With the writing, directing producing brothers, Ethan and Joel Coen, creators of such classics as Blood Simple, Barton Fink, Miller's Crossing, Fargo, etc., you expect quirkiness, colorful characters, actors cast against type, Mamet-like dialogue, biting sarcasm and satirical wit. And, I am happy to say, all of those things are found in their latest cinematic endeavor, Hail, Caesar! I am not happy to say that the sum isn't greater than the parts and this film, when stacked against their previous ones, simply does not work.<br/><br/>The film consists of several separate stories involving the shameless (and rather petty) trials and tribulations of hailceasar6certain ""stars"" under contract to the fictitious Capitol Pictures in Hollywood circa late 40s/early 50s. The thread of diverse stores are held together by the studio's ""cleaner"" and ""equalizer"" Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). Mannix has to deal with everything from actor abduction to covering up a pregnancy for the studio's leading lady. Overworked and underpaid Mannix squelches the sins of studio with quick dispatch. Meanwhile, he remains conflicted over his personal venial sins of sneaking cigarettes and lying to his wife about it.<br/><br/>The acting was wonderful. Brolin certainly possesses the physical presence to hold the separate pieces of the story together. The ensemble cast made up of name actors and Coen alumni was spot-on; including George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Jonah Hill (blink and you'll miss him, yet he is featured on the movie poster - talk about oxymoronic Hollywood), Frances McDormand, etc. I felt like I was watching the classic comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and playing name those cameos. Alden Ehrenreich is terrific as the rodeo champion who is a fish out of water in Hollywoodland. Channing Tatum is especially a standout in a Gene Kelly homage to On The Town. (It's almost worth the price of admission just to see Channing.)<br/><br/>So what's the problem? As a whole, the film didn't hold together; it was draggy, at times pedantic and even self-indulgent (during an homage to Esther Williams' mermaid/water dance films, I felt like standing up and saying, ""Alright already! We get it!"" There is only so far you can carry a joke. The predecessor Coen films were quirky, humorous and engaging without being pretentious. Here, it almost seems as if the Coen duo set out to make the most pretentious film possible. I felt as if the filmmakers were hijacked by copycat aliens who endeavored to make a Coen-like film rather than an authentic Coen film.<br/><br/>Having directed a satirical comedy in the past about Hollywood (and vowing never to do another one again because of the subjectivity involved), I understand how difficult the genre can be for the filmmaker. The Coen brothers have been amazingly consistent at making engaging, dark satirical comedies. Hail Ceasar!, unfortunately, is not one of them."

","'Hail Caesar' is not the first movie where Joel and Ethan Coen have lovingly curated a pastiche of another world, and then proceeded to make a comedy that isn't really funny because it doesn't have a heart. There really is something wonderful about this over-the-top portrait of 1940s' Hollywood; but its marred by the film's deliberate self-consciousness, from the ridiculous voiceover (as also used in 'The Big Lebowski') downwards. The Coens are often acclaimed, and there's no doubt they have a certain vision; but to my mind, the only film of theirs that worked completely was 'Fargo', where the deadpan comedy of the absurd was matched by a portrait of everyday tenderness. But 'Hail Caesar' feels more like an (admittedly clever) act of self-love."

A bundle of very different characters mashed up in Hollywood with all types of different aspirations.<br/><br/>I saw this move when it first came out and thought it was just a good Coen brothers movie. I stumbled on YouTube clips last night and stated watching. There were 10 or so clips and what I noticed was each clip of different scenes would all have the same ""best part or scene in the movie"" in the comment section. It was like watching 10 shot movies with different actors knocking it out of the park. I get that plot and story flow are a big deal for some people and this movie can seem like many fragments scattered where the viewer is trying to figure out what's going on. All I can say is watch it one more time. What seemed like good fragments comes together to make what think is my favorite Coen brothers movie.<br/><br/>PS. Eschelon's Song by The Red Army Choir is probably the best closing credit song ever and if you don't choose to watch the movie at least YouTube this song for serious inspiration."
"classicalsteve","8","1","1","8 March 2019"," Movies Within a Movie: Only the Coen Bros Could Zing 1950's Hollywood Culture: All the World's a Movie
","From the very beginning of film as manufactured entertainments to be consumed not unlike candy and popcorn until circa 1965, the Hollywood studios were giant movie factories. They cranked out films like the latest dessert or candy bar to be quickly devoured and ingested until the next time. The studios were often making multiple films on different sound stages. When television became serious competition for entertainment seekers in the 1950's, the studios fought back by making large epic pictures in a new format: Cinemascope, a widescreen format which could not be accommodated by current television technology. Cinemascope films often took place in ancient times: ""The Robe"", ""Ben Hur"", and ""The Ten Commandments"". (Only by circa 1990 did some films begin appearing on VHS tape in their original widescreen formats.)<br/><br/>The Coen brothers attack the old Hollywood studio system and culture with the subtlety of a hacksaw and apply it to pre-1960 Hollywood like King Kong escaping from his bonds. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is a ""movie star"" in the old pre-Marlon Brando sense. He plays over-the-top characters in love stories and epics, not just to please cinema-goers who like the stories of his films, but also his adoring fans who will pay the box office to watch whatever he stars in. He's currently in ""Hail, Caesar!"" (undoubtedly similar to ""The Robe"", the first ever Cinemascope movie, and ""Ben Hur"") as a centurion who will experience the humanity and divinity of Christ in ancient Palestine.<br/><br/>Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a movie mogul probably modeled after Louis B. Mayer (who executive produced MGM musicals) and Darryl F. Zanuck (producer of ""Gone with the Wind""). The actors under contract under the studio Capitol Pictures are his chess pieces, and he moves them around from film-to-film, the studio being like a giant chess board. Mannix assigns his actors and directors at will. But he not only controls the projects; he also governs the lives of the Hollywood people. He determines who will go with whom to film premiers, and even occasionally gets involved with directing their person lives in terms of marriages and families. (In point of fact, Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller was forced by the studios to divorce his wife. The conventional wisdom: female audiences would be less interested in attending his Tarzan films if they knew he was married and unavailable.)<br/><br/>The film ""Hail Caesar"" is only a few scenes away from completion, but their star, Whitlock has been kidnapped! Interspersed with this plot are sequences in which we view other films being shot. In particular we meet a country-western airhead who is playing in musical westerns. He's tapped by the studio to play a supporting character in a sophisticated costume drama which has dire consequences! We also see a bar scene in a movie musical being shot where all the off-duty sailors break into song and dance! In the meantime, a horrid stand-in takes the place of Whitlock, and they shoot his scenes with his back to the camera!<br/><br/>While most critics enjoyed this scathing reality check of Hollywood culture, general movie goers were less than enthusiastic. There are many in-jokes about the entertainment industry, not all of them flattering, some of them sobering. In some scenes which are supposed to be ""real life"", the scenes look like film shots, particularly with the sky appearing more like a painting than real. I think the point the Coen brothers are making is that the entire Hollywood world is an endless movie in and of itself. Especially when you consider the gossip columnists who endlessly used their pens like swords to expose the latest scandalous behavior behind the scenes. A really fun movie if you understand the unreality of Show Biz. All the world's a movie, without the credits!"

They reference their own films constantly and use their famous mirroring of symbolic images and scenes to connect dots ...

"Tweekums","8","1","1","3 September 2018"," A fun look at Hollywood's 'Golden Age'
","This film gives us a look at one day in the lives of those working for a Hollywood studio in the 1950s. Mostly it focuses on fixer Eddie Mannix who links various stories involving various film stars. Most prominent amongst these are the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock, the lead in a new Biblical epic, by communists; western star Hobie Doyle being asked to appear in a classy drama which demands skills he doesn't have and actress DeeAnna Moran who is pregnant but not married. During the course of the film we also see scenes from the films the characters are making; these include a song and dance routine, a spectacular display of synchronised swimming and a comical western scene.<br/><br/>This film from the Cohen Brothers is part homage, part tongue-in-cheek jab at Hollywood's golden age when studios churned out westerns, made spectacular musicals and the biggest films were epics set in biblical times. The studios micromanage their stars to ensure their public images are squeaky clean and even serious failings are covered up. This is all done in a way that provides plenty of laughs; I loved Alden Ehrenreich's cowboy as he struggles in a new role as a far more sophisticated character and George Clooney's leading man, in full Roman uniform, as he is kidnapped by communists. There are some fun little twists as we learn more about the characters. The cast are clearly having fun; thankfully in a way that is fun for the audience too. The story is fairly light but that doesn't matter as it is more about the fun moments than a deep plot. Overall fans of the Cohens' lighter fare should enjoy this."

","The Coen Brother's star-studded film, Hail, Caesar! jumps into the backseat with golden-age Hollywood, but fails to measure up to its inspiration. The plot jumps around a lot, and really seems to just be an excuse for the directors to shoot multiple scenes reminiscent of older films (Ben Hur, The Robe, Anchors Away, Ricky Nelson films, etc.). There are many funny moments, but there is little cohesion to them, and it is easy to get lost. With an all-star cast, including Jonah Hill, George Clooney, Channing Tatum, and Scarlett Johansson, it would've been nice to see more well- rounded characters. Channing Tatum's character seems to have only been included to prove that Channing Tatum can sing. In fact, most of the characters seem to contribute little to the plot at all. All this being said, the movie is fun. It is light hearted and enjoyable. The plot may have more detours than a cross-country drive, but each detour has a charm all its own. Best advice: don't worry about the plot, just enjoy each scene for what it is."

","... it really is a ""Tale of the Christ"" in allegory. Eddie Mannix is ""the fixer"" for a Hollywood movie studio, Capitol Pictures. His story is supposed to be in parallel with that of the Christ. This is not at all obvious. I had to watch it a couple of times - a couple of times in which I was actually trying to pick up all of the pieces of Hollywood history - to actually get it. Eddie is trying to quit smoking, and he is continually going to confession about his failures in this area. The devil is actually Lockheed, which offers Eddie a tempting offer to abandon his ""flock"" - the stars he looks after - in return for an easy job and financial security. He's got a family - wife and two kids - and television is on its way. What will he do? In the meantime Eddie's ""flock"", the stars of Capitol Pictures, are modelled after Hollywood history of the year in which this is set - 1951. Eddie is trying to deal with the unwed pregnancy of an Esther Williams clone, who curses, smokes (while pregnant), and is not at all sure who the father of her child is. Then there is the sudden disappearance of their biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), without whom ""Hail Caesar"" cannot be completed. It makes fun of the singing cowboys, and what happens when you try to install one in a drawing room drama with a snooty directory, and even Carmen Miranda and Tilda Swinton as identical twins and competing gossip columnists - I am assuming she is supposed to be Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons - are lampooned.<br/><br/>In this version of 1951, ""the Commies"" are real threats, not just boogeymen, and figure largely into the plot.<br/><br/>If the Cohens made a mistake here it would be depending upon the audience knowing about old Hollywood and getting the allegory of Eddie Mannix as the Christ. You could watch and enjoy ""Fargo"" and know nothing about Minnesota, you could watch and enjoy ""Blood Simple"" and ""Raising Arizona"" and know nothing about the American southwest, but it might be tough going to watch this and get all of the jokes and plot points and know nothing of the history of Old Hollywood."

","This film seemed to get quite a mixed response when it came out, and watching for myself I can understand why. On one hand it is a light bit of fun, which is professionally delivered in all aspects; however at the same time it always feels like it could easily have been more than this – and maybe could have delivered more along the lines of other Coen brother films. How strongly you feel about this will depend on the individual; for me I fell between the two stools.<br/><br/>As a comedy I enjoyed it. It had smart dialogue and characters, all with plenty of color and atmosphere. At the same time the film looked great from the cinematography through to the cast involved. This did work against it for me too then; mainly because it seemed to always harken back to other films such as Barton Fink, and other better films. This feeling is confirmed because Hail Caesar! is at its best in the moment, but doesn't really build or develop into something more satisfying. It is still funny, very well delivered, and enjoyable as part of the familiar Coen world, but they have done better, and it is hard not to think that while watching this."

","The latest film by Hollywood's best directing pair (Joel and Ethan Coen) ""Hail, Caesar!"" features the best ensemble cast displayed in the Coen Brothers' career thus far. The film contains all the classic trademarks of a Coen Brothers picture, however, the movie is polarizing and something that only 50+ year olds can enjoy with its dated jokes, esoteric references, and lack of a focused narrative.<br/><br/>""Hail, Caesar!"" starts out strong with some finely tuned humorous scenes bolstered by sharply written dialogue by the Coen Brothers. The premise, as shown in the trailer, is another abduction/ransom plot with a clever Coen Bros twist. As the movie goes on the plot becomes more stretched out with subplots that stray away from the main plot/focus. This leaves a handful of moviegoers (anyone under about 40-years-old in this case) bored with nothing but hit-or-miss 50's humor and cryptic references to entertain. The story did not have enough spark and vigor to carry its rather short runtime unlike what The Coen Bros did in ""Fargo,"" and ""No Country for Old Men,"" nor did it achieve the comedy gold in ""The Big Lebowski,"" and even the underrated ""Burn After Reading."" Although it did have all the fine performances, deft dialogue, colorful cinematography, and exquisite period detail that all the films listed above had. <br/><br/>It's a shame that all the talent and flair the Coen Brothers could muster up only produced an iffy crime story without any dramatic heft in its watered-down plot with dated jokes only 50-year-olds would get. Yet it still would be unfair to say this movie was garbage because of its filmmaking craft. The Coen Brothers really are some of the most competent and distinctive directing voices. Only if next time they could make a more universal and comprehensive picture that would captivate audiences of all ages instead of just anyone familiar with 1950's pop culture."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","1","9 April 2016"," Another good Coen Brothers achievement
","""Hail, Caesar!"" is an American 100-minute movie that came out this year and plays roughly half a century in the past. It features some of the most known Hollywood actors right now, but I will not go into detail there as you can check out the cast list for that. Still, I want to comment on some of them. Brolin was okay as the main character. Admittedly his material wasn't as a baity as some of the supporting players' material. This especially refers to George Clooney who could let it all out here and had some pretty funny moments. Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum were so-so. I personally did not find their characters really that entertaining. Scarlett Johansson was different to what she usually plays. Thumbs up for that, even if it was just a minor role. Jonah Hill was basically a long cameo. Pill was pretty forgettable. One of the finest performances came from Ralph Fiennes, who proves once again that a mix of drama and comedy is perfect for him. Great line delivery. And finally, a special mention goes to Alden Ehrenreich, who not only held his own very well against all these big names, but actually is a definite contender for MVP. He may have a great career ahead.<br/><br/>As a whole, this film works best when you see it as a retro comedy. Yes, there are dramatic moments and political references, but it is all very light-hearted. The Coens give the film their usual approach with their very unique brand of situational comedy that works oh so well. I personally loved ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" and it would not be fair to compare this film here to their best achievements. It is not among their greatest works, but that is only because they have been so amazing in the past, not because this one here sucked. It certainly didn't. ""Hail, Caesar!"" was quite an entertaining watch from start to finish. Smartly written and executed with precision and lots of love to detail. I recommend checking it out, especially to fans of the television show ""Mad Men"" as this is exactly the era during which it is set and you may have one or two déjà vus here. Costumes and music were convincing too from the perspective you see them. Go check it out."
"jmoneyjohal","8","6","15","5 February 2016"," Kudos to the Coen brothers for making a hilarious and highly entertaining film.
","The Coen brothers don't make bad films,they actually either make classics like Fargo, No Country For Old Men etc or they make near classics like the superbly entertaining film Hail Caesar which I viewed today. I mean these brothers have dabbled in making thrillers, biopics, gory films, comedies, they are masters of all genres. There is a reason why there name is listed with some of the best filmmakers of the world. And with Hail Caesar they strength there status, and make a comedic film on Hollywood and the studio system /rise of communism in Hollywood.While the film was not no extraordinary piece of cinema I would call pathbreaking as maybe you thought was in the offering from the Coen brothers, they actually make there most commercial film till date, and make sure the audience is fully entertained with the extravagant world they create. Hail Cesar is easily the most entertaining film I have seen in this new year of 2016. The film never has a dull moment, here we get see the hilarious insides and outs of Hollywood in the year 1950. The way films are made, how they are casted, all have such a hilarious truthful tone. Even the films main crux a kidnapping is done in a comedic manner. The film has no serious bone, but still Hail Caesar speaks volumes. However what makes Hail Caesar a great film is the casting, and the amazing performances, mainly speaking of Josh Brolin who just lights the screen on fire. Hail Caesar is the most fun I have had in theatres in 2016, however the film has a hangover of Trumbo which released last year, but more on that later.<br/><br/>Story wise Slick Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix is pressed into action when superstar actor Baird Whitlock is kidnapped and held for ransom by a communist group. Mannix races to quietly collect the ransom money without gossip columnist Thora Thacker catching wind of the scandal.<br/><br/>Acting wise Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix is the life of the film, he gives one of the best performances of 2016 till now in Hail Ceasar. He shows such variation in his character it's amazing, when he needs to underplay he does it beautiful, at times he is at his comedic best, and at times he is menacing as a Hollywood fixer. The scene when he is slapping George Clooney, and at the end says your a star, that scene was cinema at its best. George Clooney is good as the goof ball actor. Alden Ehrenreich is hilarious as the cowboy actor who can't even say a line proper, at times he steals the show with his comedic act, watch out for his conformation with Ralph Fiennes while shooting a scene in a film. Thora was great in a double role. Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Scarlett Johansson all have cameos but they all add great weight age to the film. Hail Caesar has a beautiful ensemble to say the least.<br/><br/>Hail Caesar gets the whole aura of 1950s Hollywood down to perfection. The type of actors there where back then ( there attitudes, mannerisms)the type of films that were being made, how the politics behind everything worked, etc was very well researched, and presented lavishly. The production values were superb, the sets, the costumes are first rate. An example of this is the introduction to Scarlett Johansson's characters, that scene is lavishly and beautifully done in the water.The Coen brothers make sure they even get the nitty gritty aspects of the film to perfection. The films main crux however is eerily similar to Trumbo were they speak about communism in Hollywood and the rights of writers etc, however while some novelty is lost here, the mood and the presentation of both films is polls apart. While Trumbo is a political film and speaks in favour of writers, Hail Caesar takes no stance at all, and just waves a comedy around the premise. Honestly the film is more of a day in life of a Hollywood fixer, rather than anything else. Hail Caesar is a hilarious entertaining comedy like I mentioned earlier,but the best thing is it's a sensible comedy, it's not your regular no brainer, it respects its audiences intelligence,and the film even has a good twist or turn. Two scenes in particular had me laughing my guts out and are the films highlight.The Laurence and Hobie scene when Fiennes is trying to teach the other to act. The other scene is when Brolin slaps,Coolney multiple times, and his reaction is priceless. Hail Caesar is just a entertaining film all around, it might not be a classic you were hoping from the Coens, it might not even win a Oscar( definitely will get a nomination or two), but in hindsight's does it matter, it's a smart comedy, and just think how many films can you say that about. <br/><br/>Overall Hail Caesar is a highly recommended watch, it's hilarious and highly entertaining, and the films cast puts on a clinic of acting. The Coens brothers must applauded for making Hail Caesar, because like I have stated many times it was just such a fun film. Hail Caesar is the best English language film I have seen so far of 2016.<br/><br/>4/5* or 8/10"

I feel like this movie is going to get a lot of negativity because: A) It came out in February so people assume it will be bad. B) People aren't expecting what the Coen Brothers do best: Quirky Comedy. I was really surprised at how interesting this movie was, there so many small characters that I absolutely loved, and I wanted to see more of, the movie is only like 104 minutes, and I honestly wouldve liked it to have been longer, which is why I cant give it a 10/10. Anyway this is a great movie to see (especially in February) and there's so many funny scenes that the Coen brothers brilliantly wrote.<br/><br/>Im giving this film: 8.9/10"

","I'm writing this review to all those Coen Bros fans that relish in the rollicking grand theater experience that only this dynamic duo can deliver. Go to the pictures, buy the popcorn and forget all your worries and bath in the warm ambiance of a delightful film. So much fun to be had. Clooney is having fun here and never misses a beat, in fact, all the players know the joke and weave a wonderful path to the punchline. I have read a lot of negative reviews for this film, so I felt compelled to respond with some due praise. Ummm, I still have to write 3 more lines to get this review acceptable for submission... 10 lines does seem a bit too much. I probably shouldn't bother considering I have offered no real insight or thoughtful critique... I just wanted to say how good it was, no-one wants to read that rubbish."

"Man99204","4","5","12","7 February 2016"," VERY VERY Disappointing
","Don't let the trailers bedazzle you - the film is not nearly as good as the promotional clips infer. If you have seen the promotional trailers, you have seen ALL of the best parts of this film.<br/><br/>Considering the caliber of the talent involved, and the cost of this production, it is shameful that the Coen Brothers ended up with such a disappointing film. It is LOUSY. This is without a doubt their weakest feature in years - possibly the most disappointing film of all of 2016.<br/><br/>The basic problem with this production is the LOUSY script. there are four, or five, separate sub plots all rolling along. The audience quite naturally expects the last third of the movie to connect all of these radically different plots - to make sense of it all.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of the film are brilliant. The final third of the film appears to have been written by a totally different writer. Near the end of the film one of the characters boards a Russian Naval Submarine which happens to be coasting off the coast of Malibu. Then everything quickly starts to go down the drain from that point on.<br/><br/>The grand climactic ending is totally missing. There is no real resolution. <br/><br/>Fans of George Clooney, Josh Brolin, and Tilda Swinton, and especially Christopher Lambert will be shocked at how badly made up and poorly photographed all these folks are - - they look decades older than their actual ages. In his one scene Christopher Lambert looks more dead than alive. This is not ""Comedy' it is cruel and mean spirited.<br/><br/>Alden Ehrenreich is the one bright spot in this film. He is amazing in what is essentially a minor role. His singing cowboy character is one of the truly funny characters in the entire movie. Ehernreich sings, plays the guitar, even does rope tricks with his food. Ah shucks, he is just the classic 1940s singing cowboy.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum also has a memorable scene in which he does a Gene Kelly type production number. He is delightful in his first scene - much of which can be seen in the trailers.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton looks amazingly lifelike, at times. She poses her way through the few scenes she is in. She pretends to be talented, and the audience pretends to tolerate her efforts.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money on this one - watch it when it comes onto pay TV."

"george-mulis","8","3","6","26 April 2016"," Hail, Caesar! An oddball critique of the Studio's system of the 50's
","The Coen Brothers 2016 film Hail, Caesar! is a delightful and entertaining critique of the Studio system of the 1950's. By mixing elements of film history and cinematic techniques they pay tribute to the genre films of the 50's, when Hollywood was considered the ultimate manufacturer of dreams. To many the film may seem alienating, as it borrows techniques and tropes of movies from the period; which to today's audiences may seem outdated. But to film enthusiasts the film not only explores the dark side of the studio system (which has always been an element of speculation and intrigue for tabloids), but also looks into the process of American movie making and its historical placement in the 1950's. <br/><br/>In a nutshell the film tells the Story of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a so called fixer who works for a mayor movie studio making sure that any scandal is dealt with so that the studio's image is not tarnished by gossip. The main arch to the narrative is the kidnapping of the studios biggest star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) by an anonymous group called The Future, (SPOILER ALERT!) who eventually identify themselves as a group of communist writers. As Mannix navigates through this ordeal, and his own personal ordeal, we encounter smaller arches of narrative and their array of colourful characters. There is Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) the western movie star, DeeAnna Moran (Scarlet Johansson) the shinning siren of the aqua musicals, Burt Gurney (Channig Tatum) the musical star, Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) the grand director, Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton) the gossip columnists and many, many more. Their narratives eventually all tie into the main arch in that very characteristically oddball Coen Brother's sense of humour. <br/><br/>The Coen's; in my opinion have recreated with great care and precision the techniques utilized by their predecessors to masterfully bring to life their vision for the film. The entire film has this beautiful nostalgic quality to it, an element found in many old movies. The use of saturated colours, the play of shadows, the shot composition even the voice of God narration that accompanies the film are all elements of classic Hollywood film making. The production values mirror those of the era; in short glimpses we see how movies such as the Religious Epics, the Aqua Musicals, the Melodramas and the Western came to life. I like to think that these small tableau's are an homage to Cecil B DeMille, Esther Williams, Gene Kelly and Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>What separates Hail, Caesar! from the movies of the era and thus making it an homage is its acerbic sense of humour which allows the film itself to be a critique on the studio system. We fully appreciate this when we are given glimpses into how studios managed their scandals and image. It is well known that back in the 50's the studios thought of themselves as moral compasses for Americans. Their aim was to present wholesome values, American ideologies of patriotism and religious discourses. It was also during the 50's that communist film makers, writers and anyone associated with them and their ideologies were persecuted and blacklisted. Regarded as a very dark chapter in film history it also reflects the turmoils of American society and the omnipresent effect of the Cold War. The Coen's play with this idea by making the kidnappers a group of communist writers who believe that if they convince the studio's biggest star in believing their ideologies they may well indeed crack the system and win, even if they do recur to the use of blackmail. <br/><br/>The other interesting aspect to the critique is the studios treatment of their 'Stars'. They owned them, lending them to other studios only if they could profit from it. Quite literally they were treated like cattle, every aspect of their life was manufactured to fit the Studio's demands. In doing so they made sure that any trace of scandal was dealt with and in return they created auras of wholesomeness, which suited the studios image. It was a marionette show, pull strings here and there and voilà! A star was made, not born! <br/><br/>I personally found the movie very entertaining. As a film student and enthusiast I found delight in the cinematic references poured into every frame. I thought it was clever and well-constructed and it managed to intertwine an oddball sense of humour with elements of film history. The Coen Brothers not only are great film-makers; they are also well versed cinema scholars and in Hail, Caesar! they bring all this knowledge to play."
"srichdway-1","2","3","6","19 March 2016"," SPOILER ALERT (Actually a Negative Stereotype Alert)
","The script of ""Hail Caesar!"" is a story about the Hollywood of 1951, as if it was penned IN the time of 1951 by someone under the employ of Howard Hughes, or Roy Cohn, two Communist baiters of the mid 20th century. In the story Channing Tatum plays a foo-foo dog loving, tap dancing, Communist/homosexual, who betrays the USA for the Soviet Union. This negative stereotype is played straight up, as if homosexuals were clearly all the above, and nothing else. This Cohen brothers plot device is a slap-in-the-face to any gay American, especially those of a certain age, who remember the 1950's. Back then we were led to believe homosexuals were evil Communists, and vice versa. I wanted to like this movie. Sometimes I was the only person laughing at this movie, but after that anti-gay broadside, I envied the people who left halfway through this movie."
"stankactorman","3","3","6","18 February 2016"," Beware
","HAIL, CEASAR!: I don't know what they were trying to do with this one. Is it a satire? Is it a parody of 1950's American film? (Possibly) I don't think the Coen brothers knew either. There're snippets of a big sailor dance number, a water ballet, a religious epic about the crucifixion, a classic Western horseback chase and shooting, a director directing, an editor editing, with appearances of gossip columnists, plus several other classical film genres and old Hollywood lore with a litany of A-listers in cameo roles all of which were supposed to be funny but fall dreadfully flat. The paper thin plot revolves around the kidnapping of leading man Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the star of the aforementioned sword and sandals epic, by a group of Communist writers and the efforts of studio head (Josh Brolin) to get him back. Except for the three chuckles elicited, I was bored to death by this colossal waste of time. The period seemed to be well executed but it's no reason to see this meaningless, tedious, ill conceived piece of crap movie. Score: 4. It could have only been worse if it opened on March 15th."
"tavm","7","3","6","10 February 2016"," Hail, Caesar! is yet another of the Coen brothers' off-beat films
","As someone who's familiar with Hollywood history, the fact that Josh Brolin played a movie executive named Eddie Mannix and his superior is the unseen Nicholas Schenck-both actual names of movie businessmen, part of me wondered if the studio-Capital Pictures-was the fictional name for M-G-M. The screenplay threw off that tangent when Eddie mentioned the actual Metro studio refusing to lend Clark Gable. Now that I got that out of the way, I'll just say this is another one of Joel and Ethan Coen's creatively unusual movies-the kind you'd only expect them to make. It concerns the makings of the studio's time doing various pictures like a mermaid one, a musical involving sailors, and one involving a Roman soldier discovering the mission of Christ. It's interesting that me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this on Ash Wednesday. There's also a singing cowboy who seems to know more than what he first seems initially. While there are some scenes that are funny, it takes a while to get the plot going since some scenes seem designed to interrupt the flow of the story. No way is this a conventional narrative and I'm sure the Coens prefer it that way. In summary, Hail, Caesar! is worth a look for anyone who likes the unusual."

Featuring a corny storyline, a waste of many a worthy actor ability, and just plain not funny, this has to be one of the Coen Brothers worst productions ever. Of the numerous actors who show-up/cameo here, there isn't one performance worth noting. Everyone was probably under the Coen Brother spell ""If it's a Coen Brother's film, it will be good"".

"tjgoalie13","8","5","13","6 February 2016"," A Subtle, but Crowded Comedy
","Hail, Caesar! as a film feels very much like an attempt by the Coen Brothers to make an old-fashioned Hollywood film, in a day and age where it is not accepted. For those who love the films of 1950's Hollywood, and the general history of Hollywood this film is a great way to spend time. Hail, Caesar! is funny, well shot, but lacks the memorable stature of the previous Coen Brothers films. For those who love Coen Brother's films this is not there best, but is still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Not that it is all that surprising but this film has quite a few moments that are truly laugh-out-loud funny, but the humor is more subtle. It should be noted that the film is not as funny as The Big Lebowski, so those hoping for another Coen Brothers comedy classic it may not be that funny. Another small problem with the humor is that while the film is funny, many of the funnier jokes are in the trailer, and naturally the film lacks surprises.<br/><br/>Another trademark of the Coen Brothers is there beautiful cinematography, thanks to cinematographer Roger Deakins. It seems ironic watching it because the film is set in 50's Hollywood and the film reels they watch look like some of the cleanest film of today. The overall look of the film is mesmerizing, and may be honored a year from now for it's cinematography. However, in many aspects the film falls short of the expectations that the Coen Brothers deserve today.<br/><br/>While the film is a good and solid entry it has a few too many weaknesses. The villains of the film are a little weak, and because of the crowded story are never really fleshed out in a realistic way. On top of that the story is a little weak, often taking detours that aren't necessary, and often feeling as though what we're seeing isn't all that important. The film also seems to gloss over the consequences of characters actions, and tries to just be funny, but not over the top just subtly funny, which doesn't quite jive.<br/><br/>In the end Hail, Caesar is a comedy for the thinking man who doesn't like the modern comedies that are often dumb and overbearing. Hail, Caesar is a film that looks back at 50's Hollywood lovingly, and for that reason is a great film for film buffs, especially those that love classic Hollywood. However, if you're expecting a great comedy that is both subtle, and brilliant like The Big Lebowski, this isn't quite that."
"ThomasDrufke","7","7","21","5 February 2016"," Hollywood Fixer
","A Coen Brothers film? I'm in. A Coen Brothers film with the always fascinating setting of 1950's Hollywood? I'll be there opening night. Hail, Caesar! tells the story of a Hollywood Fixer, named Eddie Mannix (sort of based on the real life Eddie Mannix), who deals with covering up several studio and celebrity troubles on a day to day basis in order to keep the public knowledge to a minimum. Out of the 6 or so Coen Brothers films I've seen, this isn't their best. But I can acknowledge that some of their previous films have significantly grown on me over time, like Fargo. But I also can't help but think this film turned out to be a pretty big disappointment.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays Mannix, and for awhile, the film fixed me into thinking it was one of the best films of the year, just like Mannix would do in all sorts of situations, because for the first hour or so, I was completely hooked. I loved how the Coens chose to represent each of the huge genres of the 1950's, particularly the western and the musical. I had never heard of Alden Ehrenreich before this film, and to me, his performance as Hobie Doyle was the overwhelming highlight of this film. There is a particular scene in which his character is making a transition from Westerns to straight dramas and his director, played by Ralph Fiennes, is arguing with him about articulating his dialogue. That scene made me laugh more than most straight comedies do.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson also have notable but brief performances and both with equally visually gorgeous looking choreographed scenes. Really, the entire cast is perfect. More surprisingly, for the first hour I loved every scene even if nothing had melded together has a fluid film yet. But that's the glaring issue with Hail, Caesar!, the film by no means works as one cohesive story. The trailers, posters, and all the marketing sold it as an offbeat comedy/crime/mystery film, but the actual crime doesn't carry the weight it needed to. Once you realize why exactly George Clooney's character was kidnapped from completing his film, it makes you shrug your shoulders and think ""well, that was a waste."" <br/><br/>I do however think the good outweighs the bad. There's so much to like about every single one of the performances and the first hour is Coen Brothers at their best, but the second half drops off significantly, and disappointingly so. Also, don't expect Jonah Hill to play a prominent role in the film like the marketing tells you, he's in one scene and has 4 lines at most. Other than that, Hail, Caesar! was a fun time at the theater for the most part, even if the second half feels so convoluted, uneven, and uninspired.<br/><br/>+Witty dialogue is still there<br/><br/>+Perfect cast<br/><br/>+Watch out for Ehrenreich in the future, the man can act<br/><br/>+Choreography and feel of the genre films are straight out of the 50's<br/><br/>-Second half drops off<br/><br/>-Doesn't really work as one cohesive film<br/><br/>7.1/10"

This movie wastes the talents of some very good actors.Or maybe they are that good an actor that kept me seated for the entire show. Or maybe I just like to get my monies worth. Channing's 6 minutes of dancing was so boring. It's a shame it took him 3 1/2 months to learn the steps.I was expecting so much more from the Coen boys. I can't believe it got so high a rating. I gave it a 4, only because of the cinematography. The film did a splendid job of capturing the 50's era.Also I wouldn't call the movie a comedy, being dark or not. I guess it's true, when they push coming attractions constantly on TV for some movies, there's a good chance it's gonna be a clunker."
"BigGuy","5","12","43","3 February 2016"," Definitely a Coen brothers picture...
","There are people who love the Coen Brothers, people who hate them and people, like me, who are ambivalent. For a frame of reference, I enjoyed Hudsucker Proxy and Oh Brother Where Art Thou, but couldn't get into Big Lebowski, and could take or leave Fargo, and No Country for old men and True Grit left me a bit flat. So now that a baseline is established...<br/><br/>Like many of the Coen brothers movies, this featured characters who were over the top to the point of being caricatures. The cinematography was superb and the dialog was clever and delivered well. I have to say the actors did tremendous jobs with their over the top characters. I also enjoyed the sense of nostalgia, for the seedy tabloid days of Hollywood, where the studios control the image of the actors as much as they control what happens on the screen.<br/><br/>The problem I had with the movie was that it was a collection of amusing scenes that didn't pile together to create a good movie. They spent so much time making fun of everything (religion, actors, directors, etc) that the satire wore thin and became stilted. At times the caricatures also devolved into stereotyping.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this to people, but I wouldn't say it's a total waste. I know there were Coen brother fans in the theater for the sneak preview who seemed excited to talk about the movie after (mostly with comments about mainstream movie goers), so there are definitely people who this would appeal to. But for me, I thought there was enough good stuff to merit an above average rating, but that's it."

"Priestunes","10","3","7","9 June 2016"," Consistent in Its Message
","This review is intended to help those who feel they didn't understand the film, so here are some things to pay attention to when trying to understand Hail, Caesar.<br/><br/>First, deliberately or not (and I suspect the former), Hail Caesar operates on many symbolic levels. The primary motif of the film is division and unity. (And division/unity should be treated as a plural, the attempt here seems to do away with that plurality.) The title is divided by a comma, and yet it's one title. That's just first base. Here's a random assortment of divisions and unities I noticed:<br/><br/>Man is split, as defined by the communists. And in pursuit of his own financial gain, he increases the dialectic, i.e., the split, the opposing forces. God is split, between Jesus (son) and God. The same God is split yet again, between Christian and Jewish belief. The main character, Eddie, is split between two theaters: the theater of war (as offered by a job with Lockheed) and the theater of Capitol. Capital/capitol itself is split as a homophone. The two major superpowers, US and Russia are split between their respective ideologies: communism and capitalism. The means of production is criticized as being parasitic and lazy, when in fact we watch the main character toiling endlessly. He, though not the studio machines themselves, is a means of production. That is, without his efforts, there would be no progress. So, his function is mechanical though he is not a machine. Each studio is a community unto itself: all workers' combined efforts produce the product. This is the unification of capitalism and community (i.e., communism). God is united as Son and Father. Theater is united as both definitions mentioned above. The pregnant mermaid when pursuing to separate (split) from her child is instead united with her child by an unexpected marriage to the professional ""person."" Lawrence Laurentz is a perfect duality of both unity of name and division, i.e., each name is pronounced differently, which troubles the simple cowboy, who himself, later, proves to be the wisest and eventual confidant of the manager by correctly identifying who the kidnappers may have been: the extras. Not such a simpleton after all. The communists need cash. Though they outwardly resist appearing slave to cash, when it is lost in the ocean all of them whimper a bit as the $100,000 sinks pointlessly to the bottom of the sea. Outwardly they deny needing it and maintain stoic, detached appearances; inwardly they suffer loss as it sinks. At the feet of the Christ, the Roman soldier is made equal with the slaves whom he had just shouldered aside, commanding ""Romans before Slaves!"" He is thus separate but equal. When the final climactic speech is delivered and the take is ruined by the forgotten word ""faith,"" the remembrance of which becomes a moment of private realization, though up to that moment, the delivery of the lines was a public moment of unity as the stage personnel one by one begin to pay attention to his impassioned delivery. We watch him digest the import, we see him moved deeply, only to cavort back into superficiality and separation from the action, for after all he is just an actor. Who can miss the halved statue of man, larger than life, split at the center, idle in the studio yard? Even the journalists are divided yet are the same. Each panders to a enquiring readership who thirst for studio gossip, though each regards herself as unique and unlike her rival. They are the same and they are not. The film editor clearly would not like to choke herself, though her scarf nearly does. It takes reverse, the opposite of forward, to free her. And as soon as she is free, she fills her lungs with cigarette smoke. She doesn't want to choke; she chokes on smokes: her oxygen supply is reduced either way. The villainous, communist writers are gentle, polite and tame. The number of unity of contradictions seems endless. Would that it were so simple; it's complicated."

The whole story involving Scarlett Johansson plays no role in the story and is probably only featured to add a bit of sexuality to terribly bleak film.

","First off, I've always liked the movies of the Coen brothers. But, the brothers completely failed on this one. Did they even try? I never write reviews, but I feel the need to warn fellow movie watchers about this movie. During the screening of this movie, a lot of people quietly left the theater, and very few looked like they were entertained. A terrible and confusing script combined with a weird and unintriguing plot makes this very boring and not worth the watch. My biggest disappointment was how the movie was marketed, with a lot of big actors on the poster and in the preview. Unfortunately, a lot of these actors have small roles in the movie, and some of them doesn't even appear in the movie for more than 20 seconds. All of this makes the movie feel like a movie the brothers made just to get it done, like no one in the production really took this seriously.<br/><br/>Stay away!"

Slow story, bland acting, too much inside Hollywood nonsense. We are big fans of the Coen Brothers. What went wrong here? Too much freedom, bad advice, bad studio input? Who knows, but this film is a dud. I am shocked by the positive reviews here and on RottenTomatoes. NOTE that user reviews across the board are not good. This film is Rotten. It has a few mildly entertaining moments, but the plot drags us into a strange Hollywood insider debate about who deserves credit from a bygone era. Cameos come and go and are largely wasted. I got more entertainment from the preview than the entire film. Watch the preview and be glad you did not waste a full evening seeing this bland and misguided film. Worth a 99cent rental on a Monday night on Apple TV? Maybe. A big maybe. Almost fell asleep about 75 minutes into this film. Boo Brothers Coen. Try again."
"socrates99","9","3","7","12 February 2016"," This movie was sheer joy for me
","The last time I was as unexpectedly elated was years ago with the first Alien film, a much different film. This film is a light-hearted homage to the old studio system which was far less innocent than depicted here. But there are no sordid casting couches at this studio and no one is hoping for a part, they're already the stars.<br/><br/>And that allows the Coen brothers to have some good clean fun with the period and the kind of characters that inhabited the era. Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich and Scarlett Johansson all do a great job channeling the wise-cracking Hollywood sorts common to the 40's and 50's. Tilda Swinton and George Clooney do much the same; I particularly enjoyed Tilda's take on a gossip columnist. Clooney's part seemed a little overdrawn but appropriate.<br/><br/>The Coens reproduce several of the kinds of scenes typical of the period and it's a delight to see them done by actors like Channing Tatum. His dance number is impeccable and as someone who really disliked that sort of thing back when I was a kid, I was amazed at how I felt seeing it now. It was as if these people were showing that era that we could do it too and I could have stood up and clapped it was so good."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","3","7","12 February 2016"," As Messy As It Is Hilarious
","Coen comedies always boast quick, smart dialogue that rivals the best of early-Hollywood's screwball heyday. However, their repartee can border on overly-heady, and Hail, Caesar! is no exception. It (somewhat haphazardly) covers topics as numerous and diverse as truth, Hollywood corruption, the odd marriage of Christianity & capitalism, and the misplaced awareness of our own sins. Luckily, none of that really matters, as Hail, Caesar! manages hilarity in spite of its own pretensions. The Coens' ability to poke fun at their own nihilistic ponderings bolsters this riotous yet complicated love-letter to old Hollywood. We follow 1950s film-studio fixer Eddie Mannix as he tries to keep his biggest productions on task, all the while dealing with actors and filmmakers who refuse to make his job easy (sloppy casting choices, unplanned pregnancies, abductions). The cast is amazing from top-to-bottom. Brolin carries the film with comedic confidence; Clooney shines in his role as a doofus Heston-esque star; and remember when we all thought Tatum was just dumb eye-candy? We were idiots. However, the standout of the bunch is relative newcomer Ehrenreich, as a uniquely funny good-ole-boy western star in over his head. With each of these characters, the Coens manage to systematically tear down the movie studio system while clearly showing affection for it. This mimicking of so many different styles shows a skill that cannot be overstated. While I think anyone could like Hail, Caesar!, students of Hollywood history will get extra enjoyment from the regal beauty and attention to detail that propel this period comedy. Despite the overreaching themes and messy editing, the Coens capable filmmaking hands make this a joyously fun farce despite its flaws."
"cliffordjames","7","3","7","7 February 2016"," A Mild Coen Brothers Offering, But Fun Nonetheless
","I consider myself a Coen Brothers fan, as I've seen a majority of their films, new and old, and haven't found one yet I didn't like. ""Hail, Ceasar!"" is certainly not a new favorite of mine, but I found myself quite entertained by it as a whole.<br/><br/>The first problem with ""Hail, Ceasar!"", I'd say, is how it was advertised. Trailers made it seem like much more of a comedic noir, where Josh Brolin's character tries to solve the mystery of George Clooney's kidnapping. In reality, that's only a portion of the whole package. The film is more centered on showing a day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Brolin), a studio fixer in golden-age Hollywood solving a number of issues with several films, the kidnapping only being one of several. This makes the movie feel like it lacks a true central plot and conflict, and can seem rambling at times. It's less of a cohesive film rather than a collection of scenes and moments. That said, the great ensemble cast, solid direction, and fun dialogue makes the film an entertaining one nonetheless. It's not one of the Coens' best, but it isn't a bad edition to the catalog."
"flamingblok11","8","4","11","7 February 2016"," All ""Hail""
","Joel and Ethan Coen are serious auteurs who make serious movies, like ""A Serious Man,"" and are meant to be taken seriously. So it's only fitting that their newest movie,""Hail, Caesar!,"" would be seriously funny.<br/><br/>Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is tasked with maintaining the status quo for Capital Pictures, an early 1950s film studio. Over the course of twenty-four hours he must deal with the hugest star in his biggest film (George Clooney) being kidnapped, a popular leading lady (Scarlett Johansson) revealing that she is pregnant and unmarried, a self-important director (Ralph Fiennes) being saddled with a well meaning, yet out of place western star, and twin gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton and Tilda Swinton) hounding him at every turn.<br/><br/>If that sounds like way too much to cram into a brisk hour-and-a-half comedy, that's because it is. The movie doesn't dwell on any one subplot for too long, but instead gives us fun, often silly glimpses into scenes out of extinct Hollywood genres. Johansson dons a mermaid tail, and swims about in a synchronized dance routine straight out of a Lloyd Bacon flick. Channing Tatum plays Burt Gurney, a James Cagney stand-in, as he shows off his long dormant dancing skills in an amazingly homoerotic musical number that's infectiously charming. And Clooney, who plays the childish Baird Whitlock, somehow makes you believe that he's too ditzy to be on the set of a ""Cleopatra"" rip-off.<br/><br/>In spite of these seemingly unrelated vignettes, or more likely because of them, the odd political ramblings, or the momentary flashes of religious symbolism seem to carry a legitimate artistic weight. The movie has something to say about artistic freedom and the working class, and has strong nihilistic undertones, as most famously immortalized in the Coens' cult classic, ""The Big Lebowski."" What ""Hail, Caesar!"" is saying in specific, I couldn't tell you; I was too busy staring at Channing Tatum's feet. And his well toned ass.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the movie is a masterpiece. It doesn't reach the emotional heights of ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" and I don't know that it will ever be quite as quotable as ""Lebowski"" (though I will add ""would that it were so simple"" to my list of usable set phrases). Jonah Hill is criminally underutilized, and his comedic talents are almost entirely wasted. Likewise, Frances McDormand does virtually nothing, and seems to have a part in the film just because she's married to Joel. The former ""Fargo"" leading lady is relegated to the editing room, where she gets one sight gag, and is never seen again thereafter.<br/><br/>These gripes, however, are easily overlooked. There's so much fun crammed into every sequence, and every shot has some joke or sight gag to enjoy. Somehow, it's also thematically dense enough to make me want to see it again. And again. And again.<br/><br/>Besides, if Scarlett Johansson in a mermaid costume and Channing Tatum in a 1940s sailor outfit don't excite you, nothing in this review could have convinced you to see this movie anyway."
"Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer","8","4","11","7 February 2016"," Hail, Coens!
","Hail, Caesar is written and directed by the Coen Brothers. It stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum an Ralph Finnes along with Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill, and Francis McDormand.<br/><br/>In the early 1950s, Eddie Mannix is busy at work trying to solve all the problems of the actors and filmmakers at Capitol Pictures. His latest assignments involve a disgruntled director, a singing cowboy, a beautiful swimmer and a handsome dancer. As if all this wasn't enough, Mannix faces his biggest challenge when Baird Whitlock gets kidnapped while in costume for the swords-and-sandals epic ""Hail, Caesar!"" If the studio doesn't pay $100,000, it's the end of the line for the movie star.<br/><br/>I love the Coen Brothers. Actually let me rephrase that, I love the Coen Brothers when they are the Coen Brothers. Recently its seems to be the case that whenever a Coen Brother film comes out, it feels less like them and more like a weird version of them. Movies like A Serious Man, Burn After Reading, Lady Killers, Inside Llewellyn Davis, and to some extent, True Grit loose some of the trademark Coen Brother quirks that made films like Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and No Country for Old Men so successful. The Black Humor.<br/><br/>I am more than happy to say that the Coens got their mojo back and produced one of their best films to date. In Hail, Caesar, its rather obvious that the two weren't put under any restraint, which resulted in what might actually be their most original-if not the funniest- film to date.<br/><br/>Filled to the brim with high brow humor and their signature black comedy, Hail, Caesar's script floured me. A satire with intelligent and thought provoking commentary, this movie succeeds at conveying its timely messages with sledge hammer force while keeping the humor as light as a feather. I loved how easily the Brothers subverted well worn clichés to deliver a movie that is truly out of the ordinary. The Coens also manage to craft elaborately strange and entertaining characters with fascinating stories and subplots. With all that said however I did feel that part of this movie's script, especially nearing the end, began to feel a bit uneven. Though the Brothers strive to instill a profound message about life and the film industry, they come off a bit pretentious and seem to have bit of a little more than they could chew. In addition to this, some character payoffs like Tatum's and Johansson's seem way to dull in comparison to Clooney's and Brolin's. Although this may be the case this film never looses steam as the pristine direction and wonderful cast always seem ready and willing to compensate<br/><br/>This movie is a technical marvel that is flawless on every level. For one the production design is immaculate, instituting a firm 1950's feel with hidden references all over, like the spaghetti western. Onward to the masterful cinematography by living legend Roger Deakens, who managed to capture life in the golden age of film with just the right tint. <br/><br/>The direction in this movie was by far the best part of Hail, Caesar. Every single shot is so inspired, its remarkable. From the fabulous musical openings for central character's, the best of which has to be Johansson's, to the precise semi-noir style of some segments, Ethan and Joel deliver, their hands down best directed film to date. My personal favorite shot is that of Josh Brolin praying to the set of the movie which truly felt like a reflection of his inner state.<br/><br/>Speaking of Josh Brolin, he delivers a comedic performance like no other and thoroughly breaks type cast. He was remarkably nuanced, while staying true to his character. If the Oscar nominations weren't already out I would be a great advocate for his nomination along with the nomination of Alden Ehrenreich. Alden Ehrenreich was a big surprise for me as he seemed to outshine most if not all of his uber talented cast. He was funny, kind, and light hearted. Accompanying him was the ever so talented Ralph Finnes as he successfully continues his comedic endeavors.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar is a flawlessly directed, impeccably cast, and passionately written, resulting in one of the Coen Brother's best in years. Hail Caesar gets an A- or a 8/10."

","With Hail, Caesar! Joel and Ethan Coen return to Old Hollywood, the scene of one of their earliest films, the dark horror-comedy Barton Fink (1991), this time to give us what appears to be a cotton-candy fantasia on movie genres. But Hail, Caesar! seems to me the more successful film. In its sly way it reveals the grip that Hollywood myth and history have on our imaginations, using parodies of Hollywood genre films not just to send up their absurdities but also to show how deeply they color our dreams. At the same time, it explores Hollywood history -- the hold the old studios had on actors' lives, the role of publicity and gossip in creating and destroying stars, the interaction with politics during the Red Scare of the late '40s and '50s -- and combines it with the parody sequences to create a movie that turns out to be a parody of movies about The Movies, a genre that includes everything from the many versions of A Star Is Born to Singin' in the Rain (Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, 1952) to, well, Barton Fink. The individual parodies -- the biblical epic, the drawing room drama based on a Broadway hit, the singing-cowboy Western, the Esther Williams extravaganza, the sailors-on-a-spree musical -- are all spot on. But it takes a special audacity -- something the Coens have never lacked -- to send up the anti-communist hysteria that led to the HUAC investigation and the blacklist. The Coens do it by treating the paranoid suspicion that left-wingers were undermining the American Way of Life by injecting Marxism into the movies as if it were real. So we have a communist cell made up of writers who kidnap a movie star for ransom, and another star who defects to the Soviets when the writers row him out to a submarine at night. It's a reductio ad absurdum of Cold War hysteria, as brilliantly handled by the Coens as it was by Stanley Kubrick in Dr. Strangelove (1964). The Coens also tease us by dropping the names of real people into the script. Josh Brolin plays a studio production chief and fixer named Eddie Mannix, which is the name of a real-life Hollywood fixer who kept wayward stars out of the headlines, and he reports to a studio executive in New York named Nick Schenck, the name of the president of Loew's, Inc., which owned MGM. One of the members of the communist cell in the film, a professor ""down from Stanford,"" is called Herbert Marcuse (John Bluthal), the name of a Marxist philosopher popular with the New Left of the 1960s. It's a film of wonderful cameos, including George Clooney as the kidnapped star, Scarlett Johansson as the Esther Williams equivalent, Ralph Fiennes as the director Laurence Laurentz, and Channing Tatum emulating Gene Kelly as the singing and dancing sailor. Tilda Swinton plays the film's competing gossip columnists, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, based on the notoriously powerful Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. By making them twins, the Coens seem to have conflated them with the competing advice columnists Abigail Van Buren and Ann Landers, née Pauline and Esther Friedman."

","I'd like to sue the Cohen Brothers for wasting two hours of my life, along with HBO, whose titles of late mostly belong in the ""suck"" column.<br/><br/>The worst part about a terrible movie being acquired by HBO, is the fact that they put it on a scheduled play list for two months. So the torture of this horrible Cohen Brothers monster, will be shoved in my HBO line-up, like it or not, and it will seem like an eternity until it runs its course.<br/><br/>The sad part is, the actors really gave it their best. Even Channing Tatum, who, if I never saw again on screen it would be too soon, proved that he can dance. Unfortunately, his dance routine seems to take up half the movie, just like all the other little 50s bits they stuck in here to relive the period were all waaaaaay too long. Reason: The movie had nothing going on....at all. It is really an embarrassment.<br/><br/>If I have to pick 'one thing' that I liked in this horror, it would be Scarlet Johansson's 'spot on' 50's Hollywood New York accent.<br/><br/>There wasn't one spot I even smiled, no less laughed. The Cohen's tried to put a comedy spin on the socialist environment in 50's Hollywood, and got so lost in the process, you are left holding your mouth open at the end, because you can't believe what you just watched.<br/><br/>Avoid this like the plague, unless you like torturing yourself."
"lasttimeisaw","8","2","4","2 October 2016"," Glitz aside, it is a droll comedy
","It is dumbfounding that Coen Brothers' much-anticipated all-star period comedy had been slated to a dumpster February release earlier this year, which received a lukewarm attendance both from audience and critics. HAIL, CAESAR! ostentatiously settles into the less vaunted category of Coen Brothers' comprehensively well-appreciated oeuvre - a droll comedy sans palpable grittiness, threatening violence or gallows humor, more ebullient in its tenor and visual dimension, a closer cousin of A SERIOUS MAN (2009), O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000) and THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998), rather than their award-reaping vehicles such as BARTON FINK (1991), FARGO (1996) and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007),<br/><br/>This time the milieu is in Hollywood's Golden Age, more specifically, 1951, a glittery insider-story of movie business told from the studio executive and producer Eddie Mannix (Brolin), a real-life character infamous for his ""fixer"" obligation - to whitewash all kinds of unsavory private lives of Hollywood stars, in order to maintain their public image and not jeopardize the merchandize they are headlining. Yes, most of its star-cast gets their inspiration from real people, sometimes a combo of several, it is all for oldie-savants to trace and locate their references.<br/><br/>The main hurdle for Eddie on that day is something could be made into a big fuss, but plays out in a much unruffled manner, the studio's biggest star Baird Whitlock (a goofily personable Clooney in a suit of Roman armors, plays dumb and ingenuous at full tilt), currently engaged in shooting their heavily-budgeted production, the titular HAIL, CAESAR!, is abducted from the set and therefore, Eddie has to gather the ransom and deliver it, which seems to be a cinch for him, as he casually packs the money into a briefcase and drifts through different sound stages, parries the harassment from the rivaling tabloid columnist twins Thora and Thessaly Thacker (a brash Swinton in her gaudy attire), multi-tasks and mediates various emergencies on the sets.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we have no trepidation about Baird's safety, he is kidnapped by a crop of Communist screenwriters, as a means to extort their shortchanged paycheck by churning out scripts for the big-boss studio, an in-joke cues the HUAC scandal in 1947 and with the involvement of a particular Mr. Marcuse, Coen brothers' sophisticated humor shtick is not at all instantly raucous, but stirs some indelible comic reverberations in after effect, especially when a USSR submarine solemnly emerges in the midnight just to pick up that one specific comrade, it is inwardly sidesplitting, although, the upshot of the ransom has plunged deadly into platitude, no way Coen Brothers would allow that money to fall into the hands of Communists.<br/><br/>An omnipresent smirky levity hovers around the whole movie, the cast is well assigned to their particular sphere of personae, Channing Tatum is still handsome and nimble-footed a decade after his STEP UP (2006) days; Scarlett Johansson is a twice-married prima donna now gets knocked up with a director (Lambert) who will not acknowledge the affair, owns the most gorgeous set piece as a mermaid among a team of dual-colored synchronized swimmers. Josh Brolin stylishly enjoys a field-day of all the hustle and bustle, the only problem of his Eddie is that he confesses too often about his cigarette-snuffing. But, unexpectedly, the biggest asset of this comedy is Alden Ehrenreich, who doesn't even have his own picture on the poster, he plays Hobie Doyle, a young upstart in the showbiz who wins audience in Western pics for his cowboy antics, and is cast by the producers to star in his first non-Western high-class drama talkie, directed by the acclaimed European director Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes), the segment where he is harangued by Mr. Laurentz to rectify his drawling intonation and hillbilly accent is comedy of the highest calibre, Alden also does an extraordinary job with dexterous élan when he is required, he is definitely the cynosure against a more well-established thespians, a brilliant cast call as the young Han Solo, and HAIL, CAESAR! is his four-square stepping stone into stardom.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, about the legendary DP Roger Deakins, who has blessed this film with an utterly glittery veneer of this line-of-work's sleekness and glamor, incredulously counterpoints what lies beneath, its wackiness, idealism, hypocrisy, partisanship and depravity, all reflected from self-mocking lens of the two from the in-crowd."
"rupie","7","2","4","13 August 2016"," offbeat and intriguing
","This is certainly one very oddball movie but thoroughly intriguing. One can understand the many viewers who basically couldn't figure out what the whole point was. Basically, this is a paean to movie-making, which is not just a craft, but a business which sometimes necessitates a lot of shady doings to keep things on track. I did not know that the movie was based on the experiences of an actual person. It is interesting that the character of Mannix is a sympathetic one. Despite all his questionable dealings he clearly is motivated by his desire to see things get done, and it is interesting that he is portrayed as a man of sincere faith. The analogies to the religious themes of the subject of the current production, ""Hail Caesar"" is obvious. It is also noteworthy that the cowboy actor, so bumbling on the set, turns out to be one of the most likable characters, and actually the ""hero."" The allusions to so many older movies are fun for cinematophiles to keep track of, and all the production numbers are clearly a celebration of movie-making. It is also so very refreshing to see the Communist penetration of Hollywood portrayed as not just a joke but an actual phenomenon, right down to the never-named but clearly recognizable Dalton Trumbo. One senses that this a very personal movie for the Coen brothers, and we sympathize with Mannix when he turns down the job offer and sticks with the frustrating job he clearly loves."

Not laugh-a- minute, but there are some great scenes - the stand out is the tap- dancing sailors who, after lamenting the prospect of life at sea without dames, are told they're ""gonna have to beat it"". Also the scene where the religious leaders squabble over the depiction of Jesus in film.<br/><br/>Lots of nice performances in mostly nod-'n-wink gags about the period.

As usual the Coens give plenty to chew over in the way they dramatise the intellectual content.<br/><br/>Overall, a bit short - could have done with tying all the plot lines together in a mind boggling maze of insanity. Plus I would have preferred more of a noir vibe, with some real menace. But it's a good movie and doesn't deserve all the criticism thrown its way."

","The Coen Brothers have given us some wonderful black comedies and dramas -- among them, some of my favorites: No Country for Old Men, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, the Hudsucker Proxy,etc. I was so excited to see them tackling old Hollywood again as they did in Barton Fink.<br/><br/>What a letdown.<br/><br/>The story is a day in the life of Eddie Mannix. Eddie Mannix was a real person, Louis B. Mayer's ""fixer"". He has been played in the past by Bob Hoskins and Barney Martin. His wife, Toni, was the girlfriend of George ""Superman"" Reeves until he broke it off. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, a day in the life of Eddie Mannix is episodic, with problems solved off-screen. Some of it is amusing. With the exception of a 30-second scene with Frances McDormand, none of it is laugh out loud funny. It's a shame because there were some fine performances from Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Alden Ehrenreich, and Tilda Swinton.<br/><br/>The old Hollywood is beautifully replicated. We have a Spartacus- type, w film going on, starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney, who looks dreadful) who is kidnapped by Communists and held for ransom. Johansson is an Esther Williams type, and we see women doing a water ballet while the character rises from the water in what looks like a big champagne glass. Instead of a huge smile and extending her arms a la Esther, she looks very tentative. <br/><br/>There's a Gene Kelly-Sinatra type film about sailors that has a cute musical number by Channing Tatum, whom I guess is supposed to be a gay Communist; and finally, a period piece that a western star (Alden Ehrenreich) is thrust into, walking bowlegged and talking with a twang. Fiennes is the director, Laurence Laurentz, who attempts to coach him. Tilda Swinton plays columnist sisters, fighting for exclusives.<br/><br/>So fixer Eddie has to get Baird Whitlock back, fix Johansson's problem, calm Fiennes - it's a major drag. It would have been better to concentrate on the film Hail, Caesar and take out the stupid Communist plot.<br/><br/>This film had so much potential, but it goes NOWHERE. And by the way, it contains an old wives' tale - someone says that Mannix saved a major star involved in a hit and run by hushing it up, and the person he hit did six months in prison for him. That's supposed to be Clark Gable, and the story is dead wrong. If you want the real story, go to snopes.com - it's a fascinating dissection going back to the original article, which states that Clark Gable rammed his car into a tree on Howard Strickling's law.<br/><br/>How the story evolved is actually more fun than this movie."

Scarlett Johansson had the accent down pat. <br/><br/>The Ester Williams like set was no doubt a difficult shoot. It was good, but it didn't quite live up to the memory of the original bathing suit goddess from the 40's. Where's Ricardo Montalban when you need him. <br/><br/>What did make the grade and in fact surpass it was the throw back to the 40's song and tap dance routine. Fred Astaire would be proud. They outdid themselves on that one. All the timing and dance moves were down to a tee. I could watch just that over and over again. And no skirts in this one at all, just boys in tight sailor whites. <br/><br/>One more thing that was impressive were, now don't roll your eyes, the rope tricks. Well OK, roll your eyes. Cowboy actors from the 30's & 40's were famous for their riding and roping. There was some of that turn your head riding going on, but the rope tricks were just like Will Rogers had been the instructor. <br/><br/>All in all, if you are in love with both sides of Old Hollywood, the in front of the camera as well as behind it, I think you'll enjoy this step back in time."

","I would not call myself a Coen Brothers fan, though I do generally enjoy most of their films. This one was particularly enjoyable, however, for its reliance on Hollywood history for both characters and storyline. But that reliance is also one of it two failings. In order to enjoy the film properly, the viewer really does need to know quite a lot about the Hollywood film industry in the decade following WWII. I suspect a great many of the references are lost on the under-40 or even under-50 generation. How many people under 40 have ever heard of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons and are thus able to connect Tilda Swinton's two characters to those Hollywood legends, for example? Likewise, how many viewers born after 1970 would immediately recognize Carlota Valdez as the real-life Carmen Miranda when Hobie Doyle/Alden Ehrenreich asks her how she dances with bananas on her head? <br/><br/>If you really know your Hollywood and film history, this is a very enjoyable and amusing film. But if you do not have that historical knowledge, Hail Caesar may only leave you puzzled.<br/><br/>The second failing was the awkward ending. The film just stops, without rhyme or reason. Totally unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Still, Channing Tatum practically steals the film with his singing-and- homosexually-suggestively-dancing Burt Gurney, so clearly based on a mix of Gene Kelly and Tab Hunter."

","'HAIL, CAESAR!': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers' new comedy flick; about a ""fixer"", in 1950s Hollywood, trying to deal with the abduction of a popular movie star (and other various scandals, involving celebrities). The movie stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill and Frances McDormand. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, directed, edited and co- produced the flick; and (like all their films) it's gotten rave reviews from critics. It didn't perform that well at the Box Office though. I really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Brolin plays Eddie Mannix; a ""fixer"", who keeps celebrity scandals out of the news. His employers' latest big production is a biblical tale, called 'Hail, Caesar!'. The film's star, Baird Whitlock (Clooney), was recently abducted from the set. It's Eddie's job to get him back, while also fending off other negative news stories; involving a pregnant (unwed) starlet, and a rising Western film star (Ehrenreich).<br/><br/>The movie is just as odd, crazy and quirky, as you'd expect any Coen Brothers' movie to be. I had heard this film was kind of dull (and slow) though; but I didn't find that to be the case. I love all of the movie's elaborate dance scenes, and it's insightful look at 1950s Hollywood. The characters are all funny, and quite likable, in it. I especially enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich's performance; for me, the movie is all about him. He's set to play a young 'Han Solo', in an upcoming 'STAR WARS' flick; and after seeing this movie, I think he'll do an awesome job. Clooney is pretty good in the film too.

But when studio star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) disappears, Mannix has to deal with more than just the fix. Add to this the stereotype films of the 40s and 50s – romances in elegant settings, Bible epics, Esther Williams underwater ballets, Hopalong Cassidy (and all Western) movies, Gene Kelley type dance movies - and movie lots with all manner of shenanigans (star turns, temperamental stars, cowboys who become romance boys because they are 'needed', intrigue, influence of the Communist party aka blacklist, etc) and you get an idea of the fun of the spoof.<br/><br/>The major star turn here is Josh Brolin who manages a role that is equal parts tough and likable and funny. He is aided by such stars as George Clooney (of course), Scarlett Johansson, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, and the team of 'Future Men' (the communist circle who are out to destroy capitalism – with a little help from the inside). <br/><br/>The film is Coen Brothers fun, not to be taken too seriously but appreciated for its parody of the Holly wood of the 40s and 50s. Kick back and just laugh."

And why did they sign up for this? <br/><br/>Everything else, from story (non existent), storytelling (don't let me go there), comedy(where?), point (whaaat?) and the worst part is that the filmmakers obviously wanted to ""pass"" a point in the worst way...which I am sure got lost somewhere from the beginning to the end. <br/><br/>Worst movie I got hustled to see in many years and I don't easily fall for these kind of complete fails that should not even be called a movie.

"gidwarclother","4","2","4","22 April 2016"," While interesting and funny at parts, Hail, Caesar! is unable to live up to its epic scope.
","The premise of Hail, Caesar! is simple: There's a movie studio and there's a guy that works there. That's it. Now, once the movies inside the movie begin to be introduced (e.g. the titular Hail, Caesar!) things start to get interesting. The Coen Brothers make a film centered on the idea that there is a movie playing on the big screen, but there is also a movie inside that movie, and there are people making that movie inside another movie that was made by other people that made the real movie. Whoa. Unfortunately, that's about as deep as Hail, Caesar! (the movie, not the movie within the movie) gets. <br/><br/>The story, inasmuch as there is one, follows Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin, The Goonies), the head of production at Capitol Pictures, as he goes about his daily work. Mishaps are never far away. Through this journey - - or rather, lack thereof -- a truly beautiful world of film production is shown off with short glimpses into the hodgepodge of films that Capitol Pictures is cranking out. The different films are crafted accordingly, the Coen Brothers masterfully weaving in and out of them, showcasing some interesting stuff. Amongst the styles that they coalesce, however, the most important elements of a film like story, plot, and emotion get lost. Despite the style, production, the Coen brothers' incredible direction, and the world that they have pulled out of fifties cinema, Hail, Caesar! remains a handsome film that is mediocre and unsatisfactory lock, stock, and barrel the former aside.<br/><br/>That being said, it isn't a film that everyone will appreciate, and definitely not one that the average moviegoer will enjoy, but film buffs might love it. In fact, it scored a horrendous C- CinemaScore amongst audiences but enjoys an 80% amongst critics on Rotten Tomatoes, most of whom would probably love the style and setting and would also understand many of the obscure film jokes. Therefore, positive feelings toward the film greatly depend on which group one belongs to.<br/><br/>Still, there are plenty of goofy parts that everyone can enjoy: Burt Gurney's (Channing Tatum, 21 Jump Street) tap dancing scene is terrific, both comedic and well-choreographed. Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich, Beautiful Creatures) is an interesting, well-acted character that is fun to watch and live with inside the movie. There are entertaining aspects with good laughs to be had, but any of those aspects are unfortunately infrequent. Some sequences that aren't funny feel as though they go on forever, like when Lawrence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes, Schindler's List) attempts to coax Hobie to pronounce his name correctly for what seems like ten minutes. Conversely, some that are hilarious, like when Baird Whitlock (George Clooney, Ocean's Eleven) is captured, feel cut short. This off balance feel is made worse by the lack of focus and lack of plot. Ultimately, it is a haphazard wandering through disparate genres.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction attempted the plot-less movie, and it does it amazingly. Hail, Caesar! tried the same thing, but it didn't have anything to support its uneventful plot. Good parts are there, and those good parts really are good. However great Hail, Caesar! tries to be, its comedic spans, colossal setting, and good direction are drowned by its ersatz and inorganic dialogue and lack of a gripping story. It remains uncaptivating. <br/><br/>F: While interesting and funny at parts, Hail, Caesar! is unable to live up to its epic scope."

","Hail Caesar, as a tribute to old Hollywood, had loads of stars, lots of atmosphere, but unlike another L.A. based Coen film, the far superior Big Lebowski, it lacked a strong plot and jumped around so much I had trouble remembering what plot there was.<br/><br/>The highlight was Channing Tatum's dance number, which brought back memories of Gene Kelly. Other than that, there wasn't the usual Coen's biting humor or satire. There were a few funny bits such as a room full of champagne commies talking about the repressed workers from their posh ocean view estate.<br/><br/>But for the most part, seeing Hail Caesar was a non event. Oh, and during the film being made within the film, about Christ's passion, the name Palestine was used as a term for Judea. It would be more than a hundred years for Rome to name the region Syria Palestina."

I generally like the movies of the Coen brothers, but I could not get interested in what was going on. I was totally and completely disinterested in what was going on, and what the point was. This is in contrast to movies such as their A SERIOUS MAN, in which I was not sure what was going on, but was keenly interested in figuring it out and finding out what would happen. There were moments when I really regretted how bad this movie was for me. Scarlett J, Ralph Fiennes and Tilda Swinton are all favourite actors of mine. Their performances were not deep or meaningful, but the characters seemed briefly interesting, and it made me aware of what a lost opportunity it was. George clooney, who I sometimes like, was not especially good in this. Make of it what you will.... you might like it more than I did."

I thought the trailer was kind of unexciting and to me, didn't really feel like a Coens' film. I'm not surprised audiences hated it at all, but I found it endlessly interesting, exciting, and entertaining, and thankfully, definitely a Coens' film through and through. I had no idea where it was going at any point and for a comedy, that's really, really rare. I have to admit, in terms of following the plot, many times I wasn't really sure what was going on. But I loved every second of it. It's a film entirely made of the character moments (I'm thinking back to that scene with Alden Ehrenreich waiting for his date with his limo driver, or the absolutely hilarious scene with Frances McDormand). I got so much joy out of watching it that the plot became totally secondary. I'm not really that huge of a fan of stuff like Raising Arizona or The Big Lebowski and so perhaps that's why I'm so surprised by how much I loved this. I also don't remember Josh Brolin being this great since Milk (yes, he was better here than in Sicario). I hope this gets some love come Oscar time but I doubt it. I can't wait to rewatch it and this has the makings of a cult classic (audiences hated it though, so proooobably not)"

","I've never been a huge Coen brothers fan so I entered the cinema without any bias when I went to see Hail, Caesar! And whilst I hadn't heard many great things about this film, I don't think it was as bad as people have made it out to be.<br/><br/>Everything about this film was reminiscent of the golden age of cinema – the costumes, the quick-witted dialogue and repetitive gags and of course you couldn't go past the fact that there were multiple nods to the most epic 'epic' of all time, Ben-Hur.<br/><br/>There were cameos galore, although this might have been to the film's own detriment as opposed to its enhancement. It sometimes felt like the Entourage movie, or the end of Anchorman 2, when stars were on and off screen almost as much as the relationship between any Hollywood A-lister couple. And whilst performances were fantastic by both seasoned stars (Josh Brolin, George Clooney and Ralph Fiennes) and promising up-and- comers (such as Alden Ehrenreich), this wasn't enough to distinguish this film amongst previous Coen brothers success stories.<br/><br/>All in all, it left me asking the question, 'What was the point?' there ultimately may not have been one, or I may have just missed it. Hail, Caesar! may not have been an epic success story but it doesn't deserve the abundance of rotten tomatoes being thrown its way.<br/><br/>motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"

","lavished 4.5 stars on Hail, Caesar! but it just didn't work for me. I love movies by the Coen brothers and they seldom ever missed its mark, but this one did. It is a satire of Hollywood filmmaking in the 1950s, complete with Astaire and Rogers tap dancing sequence, Esther Williams' synchronised swim-dance, the communist left wing insurgency, the Hollywood classic aspect ratio and even the gossip columnist of that bygone era. But everything feels so slapdash with little regard given to a already flimsy plot. The characters didn't lift off the screen and feel so dull. Sure, there are some surreal scenes with dry wit, but this is no The Grand Budapest Hotel. This all style and no substance, and mostly dull and uninspired. I struggled to keep awake but I was weak; I kept hoping something will happen and the whole movie will lift off. I should have left with a couple midway through the movie."
"tymbus","7","2","4","18 March 2016"," HAIL, THE COEN BROTHERS! A goof-ball comedy with a soul that's all heart
","Misunderstood as a mere satire on the 1950s' Hollywood film industry, Hail, Caesar! is a parable of sorts in which theological debate is conducted through a series of entertaining pastiches of movie genres and a boardroom meeting. <br/><br/>Hail, Caeser!'s key moment comes when Studio executive Eddie MannIx (Josh Brolin) is offered a choice; continue his acts of creation or destroy worlds by joining the board of directors of aeronautics company Lockheed to help with the development and delivery of the H- Bomb. The fact that this offer is made in a Japanese restaurant is darkly comical moment but exactly what we've come to expect from two brothers whose taste for comical macabre is grimmer than the brothers Grimm.<br/><br/>By the time the film ends with a camera tilt slowly revealing a water tower emblazoned with the world BEHOLD, we have learned God's answer. He loves us even if, at times, he has better things to do. The shot itself mirrors the rising periscope and turret of a Russian submarine that emerges off the Californian coast to offer cold comfort to a communist fellowship of discontented writers. it's another great moment in which the follies of atheism, here idolatry and avarice, are played out in the broad Technicolor strokes of a 1950's blockbuster.<br/><br/>It is not clear that film star Baird Whitlock is Christ because religious leaders assembled by Mannix to head off criticism of the studio's biblical epic 'Hail, Caesar!' (the movie within the movie) can't agree whether God even needed a son - although they give the film a green light. TV SF fans will enjoy Robert (Star Trek: Voyager) Picardo's contribution as a kvetching, but ultimately pragmatic, Rabbi.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays Whitlock as an amiable buffoon, susceptible to the blandishments of his communist captors. They want the ransom money to help with the cause but they also want publicity photos of Clooney nibbling cucumber finger food and to win the heart and barely perceptible mind of the star himself. Mannix saves the star's sole with repeated slaps across the face and a chastened Clooney returns to work under the studio system.<br/><br/>It is perhaps unfortunate that the Hollywood gloss, goof-ball performances and show stopping stunts seemed to have misdirected reviewers who have written 'Hail, Caesar!' off as Cohen Brothers Lite. But the campery hides a lot of heart, particularly in a story line that sees singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) called by Mannix to fulfill a role he never wanted to play.<br/><br/>Audacious, witty and knowing, 'Hail, Caeser!' may well test your faith in the people who brought you Fargo and No Country for Old Men, but I must confess that I came away a believer."
"kgprophet","6","2","4","13 February 2016"," Classic or Formula Coens is in Eye of the Beholder
","The Coen brothers have been making their style of movies for long enough now that they have a definitive formula to their screenplays. Everything therefore is gauged in your appreciation of their formula. Many claim to have spotted a trend of classic followed by a dud. I have not paid that close attention to that phenomena, but I judge by my own reaction: was I entertained?, was I drawn into the story? Everyone may have their own list of favourite Coen bros films throughout the years, and there may be certain attachments beyond the quality of the filmmaking that can be attributed to that.<br/><br/>For instance, I found ""Fargo"" to be a simple tale with a B-movie budget, with the Coen's tapping into an obvious well for humour - the quirky behaviour and language of Minnesotans.<br/><br/>""Miller's Crossing"", on the other hand, is such a well layered piece of scriptwriting that it deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence with ""Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>""Barton Fink"" I have a bias against since I knew for a while that this script was born out of exhaustion when the script for ""Miller's Crossing"" was taking so long. It feels like a half-baked attempt at finding nuance while hoping to get a green light by throwing horror into the second half.<br/><br/>I'm sure I have already caused disagreement with other Coen bros fans. ""Barton Fink"" has a legion of critics who say it's one of their best works. Which brings us to the too lightweight ""Hail, Caeser!"". Right off the bat - where is George Clooney? Sure, he is kidnapped, but that shouldn't limit his screen time to a few poignant pieces of dialogue with his captors. Same goes for Scarlett Johansson, which is really only a cameo. She is talked about more off-screen than is seen on-screen.<br/><br/>I thought many critics would be comparing this film to ""My Favorite Year"", where a big movie star disappears, and a studio employee is responsible for finding him and returning him back for the big finale. The era for that film is the golden age of television. This is a slightly older period, but nevertheless the script is a series of set pieces meant to highlight movie-making of the early 1950s. What actually brought me out to the theatre to witness this on the big screen was Roger Deakins' cinematography; only to be denied a proper showing with a dim bulb and fuzzy out-of-focus image.<br/><br/>This film is a series of set pieces, kind of stitched together through the Capitol Studio lot, with James Brolin being the ringleader. Here I was not sure what to make of Brolin's character. Is it a complaint that he was too normal (too human)? There are other set pieces that are close to slapstick, including Clooney's character, which kind of betrays the tone with the more serious Brolin and his tender wife. With other films taking the film-within-a-film motif to a greater degree, I felt the characters had too few layers, and hence a little less satisfying.<br/><br/>But then again, a lightweight Coen bros film is still astute in fleshing out dialogue and finding an offbeat subject that has a sense of individuality. With some setpieces finding true smile-inducing characters with appealing antics (Alden Ehrenreich performs lasso tricks!), and a briskly paced day-in-the-life of the motion picture studio, this film still has much more to offer than other similar attempts (puts the over-rated ""The Artist"" to shame).<br/><br/>I am writing this review having just watched it, and perhaps it would be more fair to let this movie settle in my mind before deciding whether to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down. On the one hand, the editing room scene feels like classic Coens. But on the other hand, attempts to build tension don't connect in the climax. There certainly is a split between critics and audiences in finding the love for this outing. Almost the same complaint was made about the flawed ""Tomorrowland"" which was supposed to feature George Clooney prominently, only to disappear for the first 40 minutes or so of the film. In this case, our likable gruff, Mr. Ocean Eleven, is dressed both in character and in costume for a larger scope adventure, instead literally is parked in a chair for almost the entire film. So for that I was disappointed. James Brolin, who had the right tone and was a lot more intriguing in the recent ""Sicario"", is a little too normal for this film, and he is the main character. <br/><br/>With a star studded cast and a story that jumps around a lovingly recreated early 1950s Hollywood, it is hard to get emotionally involved with any of the main characters, so the final determination I suppose comes down to - was I entertained? I would say, just barely, making this a more mediocre outing than other heightened Coen worlds that are preserved in the pantheons of the critical mass. On the other hand, on a cold February afternoon that a Minnesotan like me decides is better spent inside a movie theatre, I felt I got my money's worth."

","""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016 release; 106 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of a fictitious film studio in the 1950s producing several films, including the 'prestige' film 'Hail Caesar!, A Tale of the Christ', starring Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney). As the movie opens, we get to know Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), head of production who after going to confession (only 24 hrs. after the previous), gets a girl out of trouble. Meanwhile on the set of 'Hail, Caesar!', it isn't long before a couple of extras manage to drug Baird Whitlock and abduct him. As if all of that isn't enough, Mannix is being courted by Lockheed with a great and generous job offer. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, who most recently charmed us with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Here, the Coen brothers go into another tribute, this time the 1950s Hollywood studio system, still in full force but already past its peak. The Coen brothers bring us a parade of characters, too many to keep track of, and movies within the movie (at least four of them), all the while crafting picture-perfect scenes that are pure eye-candy if nothing else (check: the water ballet scene with Scarlett Johansson's character; the dance and tap foot scene with Channing Tatum's character, etc.). The movie is carried by the performances, more so than the story, and for me the big revelation is Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle, the singing cowboy who now must deliver in a regular speaking part. A number of the big names only appear briefly (Johansson, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, etc.). There is a wonderful score. courtesy of composer Carter Burwell, who seems to be everywhere these days (he's got 3 other films in the theaters right now, including ""Carol"" for which he received an Oscar nomination, ""Anomalisa' and ""The Finest Hours""). Bottom lime: the movie works best as something to enjoy in the moment, without thinking about it too much. In that sense, while this is of course a fine movie, it is also one of the Coen brothers' more forgettable movies.<br/><br/>""Hail, Caesar!"" opened nationwide last weekend, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely (and leaning heavily towards seniors, I might add). As the movie's end titles started to roll, the guy seated next to me asked his wife ""what was the point of this movie?"". The answer is that there is no point to this movie, it is made to be enjoyed in the moment, with a good dose of nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age. If you have a chance to see ""Hail, Caesar!"", be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I encourage you to do so and draw your own conclusion."
"ethanj-41027","6","0","0","30 April 2020"," Disappointing Adventure
","Hail, Caesar! (2016) - [6/10]<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers typically make really good films - typically. There are moments in this film that are great, but those are just moments. The rest of the film is mediocre. I was quite disappointed with this film, and I think most people were. It felt really incomplete and all over the place. There really wasn't a main character, and most of the characters felt emotionally detached from the viewer. I couldn't connect with any of the cast (aside from one, maybe two characters) and when I began to do so, that character would disappear. With more than a couple absurd jokes, strange ""out-of-the-blue"" twists, and a star-studded cast, Hail, Caesar! (2016) tries to be so much, but fails to achieve anything it set out to accomplish (get it ""set"" because a large majority of the film takes place on various different film sets). There are three things that are good about this film. The production design, the cinematography, and the dialogue. The rest of the components that create a feature film feel incredibly lackluster. The writing (aside from the dialogue) isn't good, the acting is undistinguished, the editing didn't work, and the directing is disappointing. From a Coen Brothers' film, I would have expected better. I always wondered why no one ever talked about this film, and now I know why: it is forgettable. I watched Hail, Caesar! (2016) yesterday (from when I post this review), and I've already forgotten a lot about it; aside from the three things that are actually quite well done. I even took notes while watching it. It's forgettable. When a film is forgettable, that is not a good sign (it's more that you want to forget about it after viewing the film). Production design. This film excels in creating beautiful sets, settings, and mood. Each of the different stages in the fictional production company's lot (Capitol Pictures) perfectly captures the essence of 50s cinema. Production designer Jess Gonchor did an excellent job in capturing that era in every single set. I got a lot - a lot - of Wes Anderson vibes. Simply because of how vibrant, original, and complex each setting was. The different settings that Gonchor brought to life, really helped this film establish a realistic world. I haven't really talked about production design in any of my reviews, so I hope I sort of explained it well. The role of a production designer is to create the visual look of the story that is being told, and Gonchor's designs make this film look visually pleasing (coupled with Roger Deakins' camera work). But films aren't just about looking beautiful, they have to be compelling, have depth, and engage their audience. This film stands as an example of the fact that films can look gorgeous, but lack true beauty in their story. The story is so incredibly strange. That is part of the Coen Brothers' style, but what made this film strange is the way it jumps around. In terms of genre, tone, and story. There are scenes that drag, and then other scenes that feel two short (it almost makes you question ""why did we just watch this""). On top of that, there really isn't a main plot. There are a couple of main plots. Thinking about it now, this film would have been much better as a TV show. The Coen Brothers try to squeeze so many different stories into one larger story, and it doesn't work. We jump around constantly, from one story to the next, and get lost in what is actually happening. It also jumps genres as a result of the many different stories. From comedy, to drama, to musical, and then back to comedy. If each of the different stories had been their own episodes in the Hail, Caesar! (2016) TV show, I think it would have turned out differently, but instead we get 5+ different complex stories jammed into an hour and forty six minute film. The stories don't have time to truly develop, as they're also edited to be occurring within each other, and the characters don't have time to truly develop either. When characters aren't able to develop, the actors' performances are affected. I expected more from all of the actors in this film. Each and every one of them has had stellar performances before, and in this it is as if they hadn't. They felt like amateurs. This is definitely a result of the writing. It must have been so difficult as an actor to figure out who your character is, and who they grow into, when there is very little to go off of. The best performance of the film was Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle. He was actually extremely good in his role of Doyle, a country boy turned star who is forced by the studio to change his public image. I thought he was hilarious, having one of the funniest moments in the film, and was able to bring charm to this charmless film. Having actors such as Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and George Clooney would make you think that there would be a lot of charm - but there isn't. Their performances are emotionless, dull, and unsatisfying. Josh Brolin also gives a good performance as the man with all the solutions, Eddie Mannix. He also has some of the funniest moments in the film, and brings a greater level of talent than most of the other cast. Although Hail, Caesar! (2016) has a star-studded cast, the performances aren't as masterful as you would hope. Hail, Caesar! (2016) pays great homage to 50s cinema, whilst making fun of cinema itself, and attempts to tackle issues in the film industry (such as writer unappreciation, public image, Communism , you read that correctly], and talent agnst). It fails from pre-production to create a compelling story, altering actors' performances, and narrative feel as a result. The cinematography, production design, and dialogue are the best parts of the film, but looks aren't everything in Hail, Caesar! (2016)."

","Having rewatched this movie, I came to the inescapable conclusion that this is my least-favorite Coen brothers movie (out of 11 watched, soon to be12 once I get around to watching A Serious Man.) Which is absurd, given that I still rate it an 8. The Coen's are masters of their craft.<br/><br/>The humor and situations are broad enough that a viewer can pick up on the general references and semi-inside jokes fairly easily with a passing knowledge of Golden Age Hollywood, but much of it still feels like a love note to other film enthusiasts and cinephiles from the Coen brothers, which made it feel a little inaccessible at times, as though we were supposed to find certain aspects hilarious but, without the grounding, we could only muster an awkward chuckle. The extended song-and-dance with the sailors, for instance, seemed too long and elaborate to justify the apparent punchline at the end, so I was left scratching my head, wondering if there was more to it, or if the Coens just wanted to a long musical number for its own sake. Granted, the Coens do riff on lots of genres and cultural eras over the course of their filmography, so this movie neither surprising nor out-of-character. Nevertheless, it felt more like a straight-up comedy of errors that relied on an intimate understanding of the era to bridge the gaps rather than a particularly cohesive narrative set in the period, with big-name stars relegated to what amounted basically to cameos with promises of plotlines that never really stuck.<br/><br/>But, dammit, it's still a Coen brothers movie, and better than 90% of the movies out there."

","Perhaps it helps if one is a connoisseur of movies from the Forties and Fifties; this was a wonderful Coen Brothers send up of a host of film genres with recognizable character references to stars of the past. For starters, there was a real life Eddie Mannix, an American film studio executive and producer for MGM. Josh Brolin does the honors of portraying Mannix, with a full plate of studio problems that require his immediate attention. Tilda Swinton portrays twin gossip columnist sisters, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, and one could reasonably assume the characters represented furious rivals Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, but they weren't actually sisters. So with a little bit of a stretch, you might consider Swinton's portrayals to represent advice columnists Ann Landers and Dear Abby, twin sisters both working under a pen name. Then you have singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who gets tapped to appear in a serious picture, which for my money, could be a take off on B Western star Tim Holt, who made dozens of pictures in the Forties and proved a very credible actor in the Orson Welles picture, ""The Magnificent Ambersons"". And who wouldn't make the connection between Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) and that former Brazilian Bombshell, Carmen Miranda, who came to prominence as The Chiquita Banana Girl?<br/><br/>So the Coen Brothers take all these disparate film genres and weave a story involving a pregnant movie star (Scarlett Johansson) in a Busby Berkeley styled musical interlude, a B Western crooner who takes it upon himself to solve the kidnapping of Capitol Films' major star (George Clooney) from a Communist kidnapping, and an inspired tribute to Hollywood musicals featuring Channing Tatum as dancing sailor Burt Gurney. You couldn't miss that Gene Kelly connection if you tried, unless of course you're too young to pick up on the reference. Which is kind of a shame, because that's what goes a long way toward getting a ton of enjoyment from this picture.<br/><br/>So bottom line, this may not be a movie for everyone, because the spoofs go back some seventy years or so, and without the experience of all those old time stars and glorious black and white films of the past, the story might leave you scratching your head. No doubt this was a Coen Brothers labor of love, so for that one ought to be grateful, as I've never seen a Coen Brothers film I didn't like. Some better than others of course, and this one might be in the middle regarding their total output, but still, I could watch it any day of the week and be highly entertained."

","Watching it for the first time on DVD, it left me flat at first. As one who enjoys inside Hollywood humor, there were a number of laughs, but not as many as I expected. Then after thinking it over and watching some of the bonus features, a new view came to mind. Eddie Mannix, as played by Brolin, comes across much more sympathetic that one would think, given his reputation as a ruthless fixer at MGM, which had two goals - make tons of money, and look wholesome while doing it. Studios needed people like Mannix, because the talent end of the movie business has been the same from the days of Chaplin to now - a great number of spoiled, petulant children who can't seem to control themselves or their egos. If there wasn't someone like a Mannix keeping the stars in the studio daycare in line and protected, it would be an absolute miracle anything actually got done. True, Mannix appeared to have some affection for the stars he had to occasionally put the thumbscrews to, but his overall loyalty was to the dollars and cents and the protection of his bosses. They trusted him to get things done, and he did it. He's the man who helped protect the images we looked up to. By looking only at the excellent re-creations of classic Hollywood genres, one could miss the story of how Mannix was responsible for keeping everything going. If the movie was called ""The Fixer"", and we had a few more scenes indicating the pressure the owners in New York put him under, it might have been clearer that this was a film about who had the power in Hollywood. Not so much the stars, but the owners and their muscle men. At least the Mannix played by Brolin appeared to have some personal struggles with what he had to do. Not too bad a film if you watch it that way."

As Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) soon makes friends with his kidnappers, that plot turn is completely defused. Then there's a tremendous ""On The Town"" type dance number, complete with outrageous double-entendres, but it outstays its welcome as its relevance to the plot (and it is relevant) isn't apparent at the time.<br/><br/>The Coens being slightly self-indulgent is still better than 90% of mainstream Hollywood, anyway."

","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I have owned it for a couple of months but did not sit down to watch until now. It is an excellently crafted film - the acting is superb (especially from the always brilliant Josh Brolin, from Alden Ehrenreich when he pretends to be an actor who cannot act, from Ralph Feinnes as he pretends to cope with an actor who cannot act, and from George Clooney), the visualisation of 1950s Hollywood is lush and has a certain largesse, BUT there is something missing - I cannot quite put my finger on it.
The concept in itself is enjoyable - the whole film revolves around a Hollywood fixer (Brolin) who is caught between his loyalty to his present employment and a more lucrative and more family-friendly role with an aeroplane manufacturer (go on, guess which one). He is currently dealing with a film concerning the life of Christ (hence, Hail. Caesar, the name of that film) and has to ensure that no-one in the American market will be offended (watch out for the brilliant scene with an Orthodox priest, a presbyter of some form, a rabbi and a Catholic Priest deciding if the script is offensive). Then suddenly the main character (Clooney as a Charlton Heston-style Roman tribune) is kidnapped by undesirables. That, essentially, is the plot and how it develops is the story. It lacks oomph, but is brilliantly played - it is memorable, but what exactly is the message that comes out through it all? There are several lovely moments, especially in the editing suite, and the score blends in so perfectly that it almost unnoticed. I laughed to notice that one of the first prizes awarded was for the hairdressing involved.

Hobie Doyle was a generic singing cowboy with a ""Gabby Hayes"" sidekick.<br/><br/>The Coen film holds some enjoyment for those familiar with the era. There were some good exchanges such as the theological debate and Jonah Hill taking about being a professional person-hood. It comically shows the Hollywood 10 black listed doing unorthodox things.

","Two rough but swell religious interpretations of this film follow below! Both were written on message boards section for this film. The first is by someone named Komarovski:<br/><br/>""I enjoyed the movie's wacky look at Hollywood of the era, but I don't think it was meant to be the focus. Audiences can't be faulted for looking only at and being disappointed by the comic relief, though, as that is how the movie was promoted in the trailers. <br/><br/>After the opening scene, the words ""A Tale of the Christ"" wipe onto the screen. We are then immediately shown Mannix to make the connection. Mannix shepherds a vast world populated with sinners, but who ultimately create good. He stands over bickering religious leaders, growing frustrated at their interpretations. Mannix considers his worst sin to be smoking, so it's no wonder the Devil, a head-hunter from Lockheed, tempts him with a cigarette as they meet in a very red restaurant. Mannix is offered an easier path, but one that leads to destruction rather than creation. To me, Mannix's struggle with which path to take is the crux of the movie. It is only after seeking his Father's advice that the decision is made. <br/><br/>Other elements of note are the demons (the blacklisted writers) who have stolen away Baird, one of Mannix's flock. Ultimately, the angel Hobie brings Baird back to the fold, while we see one of Mannix's truly lost ones pulled down into Hell (or the Pacific Ocean, as it were). The wayward son Baird is welcomed back, but when he extols the virtues of his captors, he is sternly punished with a regretful slap. Humbled Baird resumes his role in Mannix's creation, though Baird again shows he is not perfect when he forgets ""faith.""""<br/><br/>The next interpretation is written by someone named DaliParton, in response to Komarovski above:<br/><br/>""I saw it completely differently. I thought Burt Gurney (the guy who boards the submarine) was the Christ and the writers were his 12 disciples (seems safe to say they were all jews too). They made Gurney look like an old-timey-Hollywood version of the Christ - buff, blonde, blue-eyed and noble. I took him getting on the sub not as going to hell but as going to heaven, and dropping the suitcase of money as a nod to 1 Timothy 6:7 ""For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it."" Jesus was pretty much a straight-up socialist after all - the one and only example of him getting violent was when he thrashed the moneychangers and merchants in the temple - and the USSR was supposed to be a workers' paradise. <br/><br/>Also I thought Mannix was to Autolochus as Schenk is to Caesar - a ""roman tribune"" in the studio system ruled by a dictator. When Clooney comes back preaching the gospel of socialism, Mannix beats him like the way the Romans treated early christians. <br/><br/>Unrelated to all of that was DeeAnna Moran - the scheme to adopt her own child is basically a 'virgin birth.' Also her name is an anagram for ""Naree Madonna"" which is a little bit of a stretch with Naree instead of Mary, but if you said it outloud no one would notice the difference.""<br/><br/>Pretty nice work by Komarovski and DaliParton. Hedda Hopper might not have liked these write-ups but Barton Fink might have. Now Mannix is a busy man. He's got to get back to Capitol Pictures' still in production ""Moses and the Burning Bush"" starring Baird Whitlock as Moses and Hobie Doyle as the bush."

Scarlett Johansson turns in a fun performance as a swimming movie star in the mold of Esther Williams, but is somewhat wasted in a sub-sub-plot that only furthers the subplot of the studio head (Josh Brolin), and his dilemma in deciding whether to stay in charge of his chaotic cinematic circus or to take a cushy job with an aerospace company.

","Despite being, admittedly, not a fan of the Coens, I was still really excited for this film, just by looking at the cast. Add that I have always been fascinated with movies on Hollywood, from ""The Player"" to ""Mullholland Drive"", I have loved so many of them for the most various reasons, yet unfortunately ""Hail, Ceasar"" is a slight disappointment even if in its own right it s a very fine film.<br/><br/>Where it fails is in figuring out what it is. It has a very messy tone and ever messier story lines and their coherence to this story is always questionable. Way to many times a scene passes by, which is perfectly fine and entertaining, yet as soon as it has gone by you wonder what was the point of it and why was it in the film, and more often than not you aren't given answers, it was just a fun scene.<br/><br/>Moreover, there simply isn't any really interesting hook or character to stick with. The stakes always seem so low and uninteresting. The whole film is strikingly void of any subtext and that seems surreal when talking about a Hollywood picture about Hollywood. When the film ended I kind of got its basic message, but I was left pretty empty handed for the rest. If only it was funny as it thought it was I am sure there would have been loads to dig into, but the whole comedic aspect of the film is undermined by distant characters and a lack of edge and nastiness.<br/><br/>Still, there is plenty to be enjoyed in the throwback. As much as its satire may be almost absent, there's lots of light irony in it that is loads of fun. Josh Brolin is terrific and is given the most interesting character of them all. All of the cameos aren't really that distracting, instead they are quite fittingly integrated even if Jonah Hill was criminally underused in a role that was perfect for him and he managed to nail in what is probably sixty seconds of screen time. The love letter to the Hollywood of the '50s really works despite everything around it, as a film fan it was quite a delight even if it wasn't as delightful as it should have been. Deakins nails another one here and his work here is pretty understated even if it is one of the best parts of the picture.<br/><br/>If you're a film fan and a true lover of the classic Hollywood, as me, you will find it hard to dismiss the film overall and you will find some fun to be had even if you will be definitely yearning for much more."

Dim-witted major acting star Baird Whitlock (Clooney) has somewhat predictably been kidnapped by a bunch of bickering Communist intellectuals calling themselves The Future, his safe return guaranteed only by the receipt of one hundred thousand dollars. Mannix is tasked with sourcing and delivering the ransom while endeavouring to keep a lid on a myriad of other studio tribulations. Hollywood beauty DeeAnna Moran's (Johansson) out of wedlock pregnancy is threatening to derail her sweet public image while likable cowboy Hobie Doyle's (Ehrenreich) switch from the limited dialogue of the action western to the intelligent discourse of the serious drama adaptation is proving strenuous. Maddix continues to battle on all fronts while the stories attempt to unfold around him.<br/><br/>The characters are all enjoyable Coen standard; Whitlock, the classic Coen Clooney idiot, Doyle the likable and honest ranch-boy made good, Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes) the theatre luvvie constantly on the edge of his patience with the new non-thespian film actor generation. No personality is wasted here and each is lovingly added to the increasingly eccentric Coen back catalogue.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is beautifully painted and wonderfully flaunts the glorious mid-century Hollywood glamour thickly lacquered over the ego-centric stars of post-war fame. It looks and feels wonderful and is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>However, a serious problem with Hail, Caesar! is that none of the main stories overlap in any way so feel frustratingly disjointed, and some of the major plot lines end up fizzling out to nothing, explained away in a quick dialogue afterthought. Characters just seem to disappear completely without any finality. It seems at times that whole story lines are set up to deliver a killer line then forgotten about and discarded like an ugly Christmas puppy.<br/><br/>Another problem is that sometimes the character's narrative is neglected in favour of the musical routines, filmed as part of the Capitol movie-making process. Although this shows the distinction between the smiling charming on-screen personas and the problematic actor underneath, on more than one occasion it feels incorrectly weighted in favour of the choreography and doesn't really add much to the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The enigma of the Coen brother's writing is that it treads an exceptionally undefined fine line; when it succeeds it's thoroughly enjoyable original film-making but when it fails it is disappointing and fragmented. The perplexing part is that it's almost impossible to quantify why a scene drops to one side or the other.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is as barmy as you'd expect from the Coen's. It's mostly enjoyable, delivers some great laughs and the acting is top notch. Unfortunately, the plot is so disjointed at times with so many aimless tangents that by the end it feels annoyingly unsatisfactory."

","No other filmmakers out there today have a more diverse filmography than the Coen brothers. For over thirty years now, the Coen brothers have been bringing us films that span across a wide array of genres. Comedy, gangster, thriller, Western and even romance have all been covered by the duo, each varying in their levels of absurdity.<br/><br/>Their latest effort, Hail, Caesar!, is a comedy that was amongst my list of highly anticipated films of 2016. The Coen brothers are enough of a draw for me but when you look at the cast they assembled, you'd be crazy not to get excited. How disappointing it is for me to say that this is not the film I was hoping for, finding the Coen brothers far from their best.<br/><br/>Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is head of production at Capitol Pictures in 1951 Los Angeles. Also working as the studio's fixer, Mannix keeps a close eye on the goings on at the studio, keeping any scandalous behaviour of its stars out of the press as much as he can.<br/><br/>During production of the studio's next big release, Hail, Caesar!, major movie star and lead of the film, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), is kidnapped and held for ransom of $100,000. Mannix must solve the mystery of who has taken Whitlock, all while juggling the troubles of other stars of the studio.<br/><br/>I found it hard to really take to the story that the Coen brothers were trying to tell in Hail, Caesar!, something I rarely say after watching one of their films. It felt very unbalanced in pace with the runtime feeling a lot longer than it actually was and, more disappointingly, came across as a bit stilted rather than a film that flows, making it harder to watch.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! ultimately feels like a load of random scenes patched together to distract us away from a story that is rather weak when you compare it to other films from the Coen brothers. That's not to say these scenes ruin the film though, a song and dance number that introduces us to Channing Tatum's Burt Gurney being one of the stand-out moments. <br/><br/>The script, written by the duo, is definitely a shining light for this film. It always seems to be the case with the Coen brothers that they manage to produce a high quality script. There are two scenes that come to mind right away; Ralph Fiennes' Lawrence Laurentz trying to get the desired pronunciation from Alden Ehrenreich's Hobie Doyle, the star of his movie, and a scene very early on in the film where Mannix is discussing the depiction of Christ in the studio's major picture with a group of leaders from different religions. <br/><br/>I found myself enjoying the performances given by the talented cast on display. Josh Brolin gives the Coen brothers a tough lead in Mannix while George Clooney plays the goofball ever so well, just as he did in Burn After Reading. It's Alden Ehrenreich who steals the show though with his performance as Hobie Doyle, a singing Western star forced to move to a period drama in order to broaden his appeal. Ehrenreich is marvellous in the scene he shares with Ralph Fiennes, expertly conveying the limit of his abilities and innocence of his character through facial expressions.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers once again work with cinematographer Roger Deakins on Hail, Caesar! and the results are deeply satisfying. Deakins is a master of his craft and I cannot express how much I love just how perfect he shoots night sequences. <br/><br/>As much as I liked other aspects of the film, the lack of investment I had in the story leads me to say that Hail, Caesar! is the first major disappointment I have had at the cinema this year."

","Offered a cushy desk job with an aerospace company, a 1950s Hollywood producer wrestles with whether or not to switch career while experiencing the most chaotic day of his life in this lively Coen Brothers comedy. The film is divided into three main problems that the producer, played by Josh Brolin, has to solve. In one, his studio's biggest star, played by George Clooney, is kidnapped by a Communist cell on the set of a biblical epic a la 'The Robe'. In another, a young western star (Alden Ehrenreich) has trouble transitioning to melodrama. In the third, an Esther Williams-like musical icon (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant but unmarried and cannot tarnish her image. The Clooney and Ehrenreich subplots work best, nicely intertwining near the end and Tilda Swinton is delightful as not one but two (!) reporters looking to write about both actors. Ralph Fiennes is also a lot of fun as the melodrama director. The Johansson subplot does not work quite as well though (despite a magnificently choreographed mermaid-suit number), while an even smaller subplot with Channing Tatum doing a superb Gene Kelly impersonation feels like it should have received more focus. Whatever the case, the film captures the chaos that comes with running a studio, and while the film could have benefited from expanding on how much Brolin loves to fix problems in his producer job, the film certainly shows a level of excitement with filmmaking that simply would not come from an ordinary desk job - and the film could well be interpreted as the Coens' ode to why they keep going in show business."

","The promise of satire combined with so many negative audience reviews immediately got my hopes up for Hail, Caesar! Of course I chastised myself because high hopes are easily dashed. To my extreme delight this movie was not a disappointment, and had plenty of laugh out loud moments. The only thing I'd change would be to flip the second-to-last scene with the last scene to avoid ending the movie on a flat note. The complaints such as ""Meh! Not enough Jonah Hill, boo-hoo."" His character was perfect in execution, and screen time. Everything in this movie was coherent and flowed beautifully. You really do need to have a variety of knowledge to get the real humor, not just the slapstick ""Ha-ha, Sailors looking gay in a musical scene."" Josh Brolin's scene with the religious leaders was hilarious. Now I know satire is not for many, even my friend was worried a lot would go over her head. If you are someone who does enjoy it though, and you have knowledge on a variety of topics, this movie is definitely for you. I would absolutely see it in the theaters a second time. I'm sure there's so much more to discover in a second viewing. While this movie does satirize Hollywood's Golden Era, it really is relevant to today. Such as everyone complaining about this movie who try to appear cultivated and learned would be the Communist screen writers, and the ones who complain about not getting the movie and that the jokes weren't funny would be Baird Whitlock, and honestly I feel like I'm Hobie Doyle. This is not just some period piece. This current world is unfortunately overrun with Professor Marcuses, Communist Writers, and Baird Whitlocks, because I hear their nonsense spouted everyday. Satire exposes these things in a clever and humorous way, that's what it is."

","When we go to the movies, we want to feel that we got our money's worth, right? Well, here's a film that gives us more for our money than most films. For the price of admission to this one movie: ""Hail, Caesar!"" (PG-13, 1:46), we get two directors and two screenwriters (brothers Joel and Ethan Cohen), three Oscar winners (George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton) and three previous Oscar nominees (Josh Brolin, Ralph Fiennes and Jonah Hill), the third appearance by Josh Brolin in a Coen Brother's film, Clooney's fourth such gig, the fifth movie in which Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have both appeared – and five films within a film! We also get three satires for the price of one as this movie gently parodies (but does not pillory) religion, Hollywood's communist witch hunt of the 1950s and the Golden Age of Hollywood itself. Actually, the film's content seems to me like a comedic version of the Oscar-nominated 2015 film ""Trumbo"". There's a lot going on in ""Hail, Caesar!"" Of course, the most important question now is, whether all this quantity equals quality.<br/><br/>Brolin stars as a loose interpretation of Eddie Mannix, a real-life Hollywood ""fixer"" in the 40s and 50s. During this one day in his life working as an executive for the fictional movie studio Capitol Pictures, Eddie has a lot to deal with, both professionally and personally. In his personal life, he's feeling guilty about his failed attempts to quit smoking and the lies he tells his wife about it (not to mention the toll that his long hours at the studio are taking on his family life) and he's weighing a lucrative job offer to leave Hollywood behind and help run Lockheed Aviation. On the studio lot, Eddie has to deal with a weather-delayed shoot at a remote location and a producer who needs a new male star for his current production (and a director who's not happy with Eddie's choice). Eddie's also consulting a disparate group of religious leaders on the historical and theological validity of the studio's current biblical epic, and handling an unmarried star who just started filming a new movie and is pregnant, twin sisters who are competing entertainment journalists (Swinton in both roles), a slew of celebrity-oriented rumors and, most troubling of all, the sudden and mysterious disappearance of that epic's star, Baird Whitlock.<br/><br/>Baird (Clooney) has been kidnapped. He was just a couple scenes away from completing his role as a Roman military commander in the aforementioned biblical epic, entitled ""Hail, Caesar!"" – and is still dressed in his full ancient Roman regalia when he's taken. Baird is a well-known drunk and womanizer, but that doesn't help Eddie figure out where he is or when he'll be back. Then, a ransom note arrives at the studio. The note asks for $100,000 and is signed by a group calling themselves ""The Future"". (No, this isn't a time travel movie.) Baird's captors are actually a relatively peaceful group of people who treat him fairly well. Of course, Baird's current condition is unknown to Eddie and doesn't solve the problem of a major production falling behind schedule. Also in on the secret of Baird's disappearance is Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrereich), another of his studio's stars. Despite suddenly being pulled from filming a western to act in a period drama for director Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes) – and being comically bad in a serious role (and not the brightest bulb in the socket), Hobie wants to help the studio any way he can. In the midst of all this, we get to see humorous scenes in which Johannson and Tatum are each filming their respective movies and Hill gets a short, but amusing scene as an office nerd who helps fixers.<br/><br/>""Hail, Caesar!"" is definitely a Coen Brothers movie. More than an obvious statement of fact, that sentence will likely carry a lot of meaning to many Movie Fans. This film is full of quirky characters, clever dialog, smart satire, catchy original songs and excellent actors who are Coen Brothers regulars (including Joel's wife, Frances McDormand, in a small role). All that, combined with the fun ""movie within a movie"" scenes, make for one entertaining motion picture. I liked this movie very much, but I wanted to like it more than I did. As with most other Coen Brothers comedies, I would've appreciated a few more laughs and a somewhat tighter plot, but I still think that this film is one of their best. ""A-"""

","Hail Caesar! (2016): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson: Another comical masterpiece from the creators of Fargo, The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading. Set in 1950's Hollywood with Josh Brolin starring as Eddie Mannix, a fixer whose job is to keep scandals of his clients out of the press. George Clooney plays celebrated actor Baird Whitlock who is preparing for a Biblical type film when he awakens is a strange remote location. He has been kidnapped but in true Coen fashion this becomes a comical turn as Whitlock interacts with what appears to be a reference to those involved in Communist activities. Alden Ehrenreich plays Hobie Doyle, a young cowboy star with enthusiasm to please. He is skilled at horseback stunts but when he is sent to be cast in an unfamiliar role he botches every take in comical fashion due to his inability to inhabit a genre outside that he is closest with. Ralph Feinnes plays director Laurence Laurentz who grows frustrated with the constant problems plaguing his latest epic. He struggles to maintain patients in the face of Doyle who is totally not right for his film but sent to him despite his refusal. Scarlett Johansson plays actress DeeAnna Moran who is first seen in a mermaid costume in the midst of a musical number. Mannix is left with the news that she is pregnant and must preserve her wholesome image despite she is anything but. The result is a well produced comical take on classical Hollywood productions and the issues that were hidden that are merely hailed as publicity in this modern day. Score: 10 / 10"

","BERLIN REVIEWS BY DELEON: BERLIN 66, Feb. 2016<br/><br/>PHOTO: Hail Caesar Photo call, L-R: Swinton. Clooney, Alden Eirenreich, Josh Brolin, and Tatum Channing<br/><br/>Berlin 66 opened rousingly on Thursday, February 11 with multiple screenings of the new Coen Bros. Hollywood send-up ""Hail Caesar"" and a turn away overflow press conference crowd for the Jury led by Meryl Streep which was an event in itself. Day one, one might say, was all about Streep, the Coen Brothers and actor George Clooney in his best jesting form and looking great in a slick black leather jacket at the Hail Caesar press conference table.<br/><br/>First off, a few words about the film. Manohla Dargis, in her sparkling NY Times review hit the nail squarely on the head when she called the film an ""off center comedy"" ~ as off center (flip-floppily structured) as it gets with chuckles and belly laughs all the way. To put it mildly, this in not the Co' Brothers most profound film, but it is arguably their funniest ever with a string of brilliant off-beat pearls by actors all of whom shine in their contrary off- the-wall castings. Basically this is a affectionate spoof of fifties Hollywood but much more than that, loaded with absurd humor of the kind that harks back to the Marx Brothers era.<br/><br/>A list if the actors and their roles basically tells the story, what there is of it: Jeff Brolin, tremendous as the blustering bigger than life studio fixer draped in a double breasted suit and topped with a bulky fedora, who regularly unloads his guilt in the catholic confessional box;<br/><br/>Clooney as a clueless movie star who gets kidnapped by the Communists and walks around through the whole picture clad in his clanky starring role Julius Caesar paraphernalia, down to leather sandals with protruding toes artfully dumbelling it as he rarely does,<br/><br/>Scarlet Johansson in a grotesque sinful take on Fifties Simon-pure MGM superstar bathing beauty, Ester Williams! -- uglified (sic) under the Coen brothers baton... The one part that didn't grab me because I loved The real Ester Williams. Scarlet is actually grotesque in this section.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum leading a bunch of sailors in white in a sly slightly homo-erotic take on a Gene Kelly MGM dance number -- to me, the highlight of the picture with surprisingly adept tap dancing, jumping from table to table -- this section had me stomping along to the beat in my seat -- <br/><br/>New face Alden Ehrenreich as a hilarilious acrobatic Roy Rogers ripoff whistling to his white horse then doing handstands in the saddle pursued by the bad guys -- and performing incredible rope magic, even with a strand of spaghetti in a restaurant for his girlriend --but this is only Half of cowboy star ""Hobie Doyle's comedic turn -- He is next engaged to fill in for an ailing actor in a drawing room drama exchanging ten gallon cowboy headgear for a tux and Bow tie, and called upon to mouth a clip of sophisticated dialogue which is like a foreign tongue to him -- the extended scene where his English director (Ralph Fiennes) patiently re-shoots his flubbed entry scene over and over painfully correcting the perplexed actor's stumbling delivery of his single line -- (t'were as though...) -- is a real rib tickler.<br/><br/>Another highlight in this linkup of comical skits strung together by the ridiculous premise of Caesar discovering God on his knees at the foot of Jesus on the cross --the whole ""Hail Caesar"" business being a kind of takeoff on early fifties religious extravaganzas such as ""The Robe"" -- A satire of all-powerful Hollywood Gossip columnists who could make or break careers -- such as Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, both played sniffingly by Tilda Swinton as twin sisters ~~ All in all a hilarious piece of extra savvy entertainment and a glorious procession of contemporary stars revealing unexpected comedic chops -- <br/><br/>Well, okay, it did get to be a bit much by the end, but a very good time was had by me -- if not by All -- of the serious minded film critics and international press people around me. <br/><br/>As far as I could tell from my front and center first row seat, I was the only one in the entire audience to burst out laughing or constantly snickering throughout the proceedings. I'll just hafta see it again with a native American audience to appreciate the collective cackle noticeably absent at this ultra-sober festival <br/><br/>The crammed over flow press conference after the screening was almost equally comical. One Polish gal addressed a long long long question to Gorgeous George, who finally replied: ""Are you flirting with me? ~ it won't work because I'm a married man now!"" ~ which brought a roar of glee from the house. Most questions were, in fact, addressed to Clooney, who between sly quips that brought smiles from his colleagues at the table, finally summed it all up by saying that it was a privilege to work with such talented directors as the Coens, and above all -- FUN all the way."
"cdleorivera","9","3","8","20 February 2016"," Solid film
","So the movie was pretty good. I liked the overall tone and how it absolutely satirized everything going on in 1950s Hollywood and even Hollywood today. The staging was also pretty good and allowed for punchlines of jokes and comedy to pay off, which is important in a satire like this. It's not necessarily as good as something say Wes Anderson or Edgar Wright would stage, but for what the filmmakers were going for, it worked out just fine. Being a Coen brothers' movie, it has all the tropes and signatures of them, both good and bad. The good is rich and lively characters with depth, amazing writing, great set design, and Roger Deakins on camera (which never isn't a good thing). The bad isn't necessarily a bad thing, but more of an annoyance in that the movie conveys the same message basically all other Coen brothers' movies have in that the only meaning life and art have is that which we as individuals put into it and nothing more. At times, the plot also felt kind of meandering, and I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it didn't really bother me because the scenarios were still pretty interesting to me and I feel like it might have to do with the layers of the film. It would honestly be a pretty cool case study.<br/><br/>Other than that, I'd say it's a pretty solid Coen brothers flick that's being unfairly underrated (and in some cases panned)."

","Hail, Caesar! (2016) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The Coen Brother's latest has Josh Brolin playing Eddie Mannix, a studio ""fixer"" who makes sure stars stay out of trouble and that reporters never report the bad stuff. His studio is making an epic religious movie but star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by communist while country star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) tries to cross over into melodrama.<br/><br/>HAIL, CAESAR! is a movie I really, really wanted to love but it just doesn't work. The film is obviously a passion project because it gives the Joel and Ethan Coen a chance to play around with former studio films like the religious epic, the musical with sailors and you've even got a pinch of film noir. The movie is trying to pay homage to all of these older films and for the most part its heart is in the right place but there simply aren't many laughs.<br/><br/>Sometimes you just sit in a movie theater and get a vibe from the audience and I really think the crowd had the same reaction I did. It was fun seeing a spoof of the religious epics like BEN HUR and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. It was fun seeing a musical like ON THE TOWN. The singing cowboy is even given a spotlight. All of this stuff is recreated with passion from the Coen's and the all-star cast is game but it's just not funny. After a while the film really begins to feel like it needed a re-write or two.<br/><br/>Brolin is certainly good in the role of the heavy pushing his way around to keep the studio going. Clooney is good in his role but he honestly isn't given much to do other than sit on his sword constantly. Ehrenreich and Ralph Fiennes have the best moments as the country star and his high esteem director. Scarlett Johansson plays the ""bad"" girl who can't keep up with her lovers. Tilda Swinton has a memorable double role and Frances McDormand shows up in one of the few funny highlights. Channing Tatum is also good in his role.<br/><br/>So, the stars were all here and the director's obviously had a passion for the material so what went wrong? I really don't know. This is just a rare misfire that had so much potential but it just never came together."
"justinwfirestone","8","3","8","10 February 2016"," A refreshing return to comedy for the Coens
","You have to love movies to make a movie like Hail, Caesar! We're thrust into the hectic world of a big-picture studio, with Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) trying to keep all of his plates spinning, be they the production of movies, the love lives of their stars, or keeping their scandals out of the newspapers. That's a tale that could be trite and uninteresting in the wrong hands, but the Coen brothers weave it with sincerity and fun, blending parody with homage.<br/><br/>It's amazing that any big-budget movie survives to completion, and Hail, Caesar! is no exception. There are many faces required to be in big movies, and many crew members to film them. To make a movie about big movies, you have to go big, too. We have lavish synchronized swims, huge sound stages for ancient Rome, fancy drawing rooms, corny dance numbers, and a Western so bad it's good.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers give us a small lesson in Hegelianism which Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) eats up faster than a crustless sandwich. Could the motion picture industry create the death of itself? Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas claimed as much three years ago. Surely, if the spectacular movie is powerful enough to maintain its survival, the spectacular movie is equally capable of destroying itself.<br/><br/>There are genuinely good performances by pretty much everyone in the huge cast, especially from Brolin, Clooney, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton, Alden Ehrenreich, and Ralph Fiennes. Mannix tries so hard and so calmly to keep the studio and its employees progressing, but we ultimately leave with a sense of fatalism and the nagging suspicion that none of his actions directly solved any of the studio's problems.<br/><br/>It's a refreshing return to comedy for the Coen brothers, who had huge misses with The Ladykillers and Burn After Reading."
"pyrocitor","6","3","8","7 February 2016"," Stale Pleaser
","""Well, I'm sorry the Coen Brothers don't direct my porn,"" fumed Jonah Hill in 2007's Superbad. Flash-forward to 2016, and Hill now occupies a coveted star cameo slot in the latest by Hollywood's most illustrious filmmaking brothers (sorry, The Russos). This is the world we live in.<br/><br/>But hey - the pictures are a wacky business, dontcha know? In fact, that's about as close to a moral or theme as we get with Hail, Ceasar. As salivary as the prospect of the Coens putting their oddball spin on the golden age of Hollywood with a bigger budget than Barton Fink was, they've sadly - seemingly unironically - fallen prey to the same vacuous glitz and cavernous superficiality of the ol' dream factory they spend an entire feature poking fun at. The result, while still pleasant and replete with choice Coen tidbits, is easily their laziest and weakest work to date. Maybe they should have added more porn<br/><br/>If anything, the film industry, so replete with the weirdos and sleazeballs that are the Coens' bread and butter, may have been too broad a target for them to make much of an impact. The oddest thing about Hail, Ceasar is how frequently characters make verbal reference to the film industry as a circus full of eccentrics in need of babysitting, as the playback itself feels disconcertingly welldull. We could forgive the rampantly incohesive bevy of subplots, and seemingly unintentional slew of film history inconsistencies and anachronisms (for a film championing classical Hollywood, the Coens sure seemingly didn't do much research) were there a core plot strand, or classic Coen lead, for everything to rally behind, a-la Lebowski. Instead, most of the characters we spend the most time tromping around the backstage lots with with - Brolin's growly Harry Mannix, Clooney's mawkish superstar buffoon, even Tilda Swinton's huffy twin gossip columnists - simply aren't very interesting or engaging; they're pale caricatures of characters done far more interestingly elsewhere - heck, even elsewhere by the Coens. <br/><br/>Instead, the vignettes that buzz with the most life and infectious fun - Channing Tatum's exquisitely bubbly sailor-clad tap dancer, Scarlett Johansson's potty- mouthed starlet doing mermaid aquatic acrobatics on top of a mechanical whale, and Ralph Fiennes' prissy, effete director demurely teaching elocution - are relegated to tiny sideplots, whimsically snipped away, like pre-feature Roadrunner shorts you'd rather stick with rather than the bland melodrama proceeding them. It's a bemusing trend that at least three or four scenes throughout the film close, anticlimatically, with a cutaway shot to a character hesitantly uttering ""Huh."", as if manufacturing beats so forcedly even they weren't certain the scene had run its course. It's all so slapdash and clumsily cobbled together that Frances McDormand's cameo as an editor who is nearly throttled to death splicing together dailies in the editing suite feels grimly prescient. <br/><br/>Still, even sleepwalking Coens still have so much to offer, and many of the aforementioned frivolous filming subplots allow them to let loose with some of their trademark bonkers surrealist visual poetry, not unlike The Big Lebowski's now infamous Viking bowling alley dream sequence. Similarly, relative newcomer Alden Ehrenreich is an inspired find as a chipper Roy Rogers-esq cowboy out of his depth dabbling in a period melodrama, and there's a delightful Wayne Knight bit that will make audiences want to dash out and watch Space Jam all over again. Otherwise, there's slim pickings on display here - even the usual Roger Deakins/Carter Burwell power combo is lacking its usual hilariously austere, cheekily operatic Coen ambiance. The Coens have always been content to opt for style over substance (or at least style bolstering playful ambiguity for those willing to dig deeper for elusive meaning), but here, we're disconcertingly short on both, in this shambling, derivative skeleton of potential. <br/><br/>And yet, for a movie so irreconcilably flawed, Hail, Ceasar sure did leave me in a jaunty, cheery mood leaving the theatre, even while drawing up a list of its faults. Perhaps there is a sneaky meta-commentary to be had after all: this film, conflating wide-eyed Judaeo-Christian worship with snarky Communist condescension of the money-grubbing shackles of the system, sure did serve as an opiate for the masses. Hey - if the only takeaway from Hail, Ceasar, apart from some charmingly Coen classical Hollywood dance pastiches, is the urge to go out and indulge in some old- school Hollywood fare (or even old-school Coens fare), I'll take it. <br/><br/>(But seriously - Coens: The Porno. Think about it, Joel and Ethan. It'd really tie the room -err, your careers - together) <br/><br/>-6/10"
"walterbruno37","8","3","8","9 February 2016"," Deep entry necessary, but well worth it
","The Coens usually combine wit and accessibility in a formula that works for many audiences. Here, the wit is sly, scattered, and arcane, like a foreign delicacy. Slow to bind into one set of meanings, it requires patience; however, in the end, it's worth the effort. The Coens are depicting the dream factory of mid-century Hollywood (""Pictchas""); how it drew marginals into its mainstream; and the competing missions and claims on that industry. Their main observation is about actors and movies, not about ideology; for that reason, the character played by Clooney is a vessel for anybody's ideas. The ideological polarities of 2015 will drive some informed viewers into opposition because the Coens offend almost everyone and tend to use caricature. Woody Allen would have had less trouble making this essay, and the Coens might have looked for a unifying context -- perhaps, with everyone working on a single film, not several. However, Hail Caesar works for those who stay and pay attention, and its final scenes are brilliant and insightful."

It's so random in the scenes that it cuts to, so if you're someone who get's thrown off easily, you won't like this movie. But it's great in the way that the other Coen brothers films were great. You have no idea what's going to happen next. The film doesn't have so much a plot, but an array of subplots, that all surround our main character. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer in Hollywood who has to deal with the fact that major actor Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped by a group of communist writers known only as ""the future."" And at the same time he has to keep it a secret from reporters Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton). But that's not all. He also has to find the father for actress DeeAnna Moran's (Scarlett Johansson) baby, find a new movie and arrange the premiere for actor Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), decide whether or not to take up a job offer for Lockheed, and investigate communist actor Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum). There's so much going on it'll make your head explode. And you'll be laughing all the way. Joel and Ethan have really done a good job on this one. Even though most of the actors are in only one or two scenes, they all do a good job. Frances McDormand for instance is in one scene only. But she absolutely kills it. This is destined to became a classic."
"ferguson-6","7","5","18","6 February 2016"," Hail Hollywood
","Greetings again from the darkness. Homage or Spoof or outright Farce? Though the Coen Brothers motivation may be cloudy, their inspiration certainly is not. The Golden Age of Hollywood is skewered by the filmmaking brothers who previously applied their caustic commentary to the movie business in Barton Fink (1991). However, this latest seems to borrow more from the unrelated universes of their films A Serious Man (2009) and Burn After Reading (2008) in that it alternates tone by focusing first on one man's attempt to make sense of things, and then with a near slapstick approach to ""urgent"" situations.<br/><br/>The film seems to be made for Hollywood geeks. Perhaps this can also be worded as  the film seems to be made for the Coen brothers themselves. Rather than an intricate plot and subtle character development used in their classic No Country for Old Men (2007), this is more a collection of scenes loosely tied together thanks to their connection to Eddie Mannix, Capitol Pictures ""fixer"". Josh Brolin plays Mannix, a twist on the real Eddie Mannix, notorious for his behind the scenes work at MGM in controlling the media, protecting the stars and studio, and protecting movie stars from their own idiotic actions. He was a real life Ray Donovan. It's Mannix's job that creates the hamster wheel to keep this story moving (with a complement from narrator Michael Gambon).<br/><br/>We witness a typical day for Mannix as he confesses to the Priest that he had a couple of cigarettes after promising his wife he would quit, negotiates with communists who have kidnapped the studios biggest movie star, deftly handles the studio head's greedy desire to shift a western movie star into a genre for which he is ill-prepared, plans a cover-up for the starlet having a baby out of wedlock, and juggles the demands of the competing twin gossip columnists searching for scandal. Mannix keeps his cool through all of this while mulling a lucrative job offer from Lockheed that would put him right in the midst of the nuclear war scare.<br/><br/>With an exacting attention to period and industry detail, the Coen's remind us of the popular genres and circumstances of the era. George Clooney plays mega star Baird Whitlock, working on the studios biggest picture of the year – a biblical epic entitled ""Hail, Caesar!"" (think Ben-Hur, The Robe, etc). Whitlock is kidnapped by a group of communist writers (not yet blacklisted) who are striking out against a capitalistic studio that doesn't share the rewards with the creative folks. It's a different look than what Trumbo offered last year. In a tribute to Roy Rogers and famed stuntman Yakima Canutt, there is a segment on popular westerns featuring Alden Ehrenreich (Beautiful Creatures, 2013) as Hobie Doyle, a popular actor whose an artist with a rope and horse and guitar, but not so smooth on his transition to the parlor dramas being filmed by demanding director Laurence Laurentz (a terrific Ralph Fiennes). In boosting Doyle's public perception, the studio sets him up on a date with a Carmen Miranda-type played by Veronica Osorio. Her character is named Carlotta Valdez in a nod to Hitchcock's Vertigo. Another sequence features Scarlett Johansson as DeAnna Moran, an Esther Williams type (with a behind the scenes nod to Loretta Young) in a Busby Berkeley-esque production number featuring the synchronized swimming so prominent in the era. One of the film's best segments comes courtesy of Channing Tatum in a take on films like On the Town, where sailors would sing and dance while on leave.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton (whose appearance improves any movie) appears as the competing twin sister gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thackery. Her hats and costumes are sublime and pay worthy tribute to Hedda Hopper (who also balked at being termed a gossip columnist). Jonah Hill's only scene is from the trailer, and it could be misleading to any of his fan's coming to see his performance; and the same could be said for Frances McDormand (a very funny scene as a throwback editor). And so as not to disappoint their many critics, the Coen's have a terrific scene featuring four men of various religious sects who are asked their opinion of the script – so as not to offend any viewers. The pettiness is palpable.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins is, as always, in fine form as the cinematographer. The water and western productions are the most eye-catching, but he does some of his best camera work in the shots of individual actors or scenes-within-a-scene. We have come to depend on Joel and Ethan Coen for taking us out of our movie comfort zone, while providing the highest level of production – music, costumes, sets, camera and acting. While this latest will leave many scratching their heads, the few in the target audience will be applauding fiercely."

","No-one in this mess of a movie comes out of it with any credit except maybe Arlen. He was not only convincing as a not-so-dumb cowboy star he rather appealed to the viewer on screen. The Coen brothers have made some wonderful films but this, most definitely was not one of them. I daresay they were able to attract the stars that appeared purely on their reputation as filmmakers. Judging by the people in the movie I think it may have been made well before it's actual release date as I think it must have taken forever to form the dull script into some kind of releasable order. Clooney ought to rethink what he gets involved in or his career is likely to go into steep decline. It is boring, preachy, confusing and I found it difficult to believe that good actors were content to take part in this nonsense. Making a movie that people are going to enjoy and take away something with them is no easy feat and it proves that even the best writers and directors can make stinkers sometimes."

","I enjoyed this film a lot & was captivated throughout.. I read some of these ""bad"" reviews by bad reviewers which simply tells me that it's either one of two things 1. The reviewer is under 35 & haven't the clue that the film industry was ran exactly the way the story is told they set up couples for photo ops, hid or got rid of pregnancies they pretty much did whatever necessary to keep that squeaky clean image because the actors were considered American royalty plus all of this was going on during the cold war with Russia & some actors were blacklisted for having ties to the communist party 2. The reviewer went in expecting to do nothing but laugh but was disappointed when they realized some brain function would be required to understand the beauty of this gem of a FILM so once the brain started working all they heard was Charlie Browns teacher.. I've always felt a film has so much more in it than a movie.. Movies are thoughtless with laughs or frights throughout & usually have bland plots but a film has it all it forces you to think, to get involved with the characters, it will have you laughing one second but wondering what to expect the next & will is evoke different emotions throughout as this film did for me.. I give it a strong 8.5 with excellent writing, acting, directing & great videography..!"

","Hail Caesar! is a screwball comedy and satire of late 1940s and early 1950s Hollywood. An era when writers were reds under the beds, stars had scandalous skeletons in the closet and both actors and actresses had to perform on the casting couch to get parts. Studio bosses had to hire fixers to make problems go away. Hollywood executive Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) who in between trying to give up smoking and going to confession is a fixer.<br/><br/>Film star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) disappears because he gets drugged and kidnapped by a group of communists and held for ransom but Whitlock at least engages in philosophical left wing banter with his erudite captors. Mannix needs to locate him fast and get the film finished.<br/><br/>Mannix also has to deal with a cowboy actor who is good at stunts but no good at speaking lines especially as he is engaged to make a drama. There is starlet (Scarlett Johansson) who might be pregnant outside of wedlock which could lead to a big scandal.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers take a scatter gun approach, it is almost free- wheeling in places with star cameos. Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) is a director trying to get Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) to speak his lines correctly. Thora and Thessaly Tacker (Tilda Swinton in dual roles) are rival gossip columnists trying out-scoop each other.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the film there are some good set pieces, the best of which is an outstanding dance routine from Channing Tatum, playing a Gene Kelly like actor and he really dances to the style of Kelly which is no mean feat.<br/><br/>The film is too messy and too lightweight despite a heavyweight cast. The disjointed nature was irritating which tried to disguise a thin plot and some of the humour was as old as the biblical epic that the production company was trying to make."

","I was knocked off kilter by the last Coen Bros movie I saw, which was ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" . <br/><br/>I panned it , even though the hipsters and the intelligentsia seemed to love it. <br/><br/>Then I thought to myself ""It's probably because you're not as smart as those guys, you shouldn't get above your station in life"".<br/><br/>Now the hipsters and the pundits are lukewarm about this one and I think it's just a cracker of a show.<br/><br/>Because of this I've realized that I AM smarter than most of the other reviewers.<br/><br/>Llewyn Davis was an aimless movie about an aimless character and if there were any subtleties in the plot they were buried so deeply that you had to be the writer to get them.<br/><br/>This one, though, was a full blown satirical masterpiece, capturing perfectly the manipulative nature of the studios and the media of the day.<br/><br/>Cheating, lies, and the aforementioned manipulation, have always been the order of the day in entertainment and politics. This film sends those traits up to perfection, managing at the same time to make hilarious fun of the political altruists of the time.(To think that some of us believed in that stuff back then).<br/><br/>Brolin was fantastic in his role, the best performance I've seen him in since ""No country for Old Men"". Clooney too was brilliant and just as captivating as he was in ""Oh Brother"". Alden Ehrenreich is just too good to describe as he plays so brilliantly off Ralph Fiennes. Scarlett Johansson is also fabulous, milking the Hollywood star role for all it's worth. I could single everyone out but suffice to say that there isn't a bad performance.<br/><br/>Tie together all of this stellar acting with a brilliant script and perfect cinematography and you have one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I must mention the music before I go, it is used very sparingly in this story but when it is used it fits so well that you appreciate the genius of the Director. Not to spoil anything, but there is a musical type song and dance scene that matches ANY scene from Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly, you will be enthralled by it! If you're as smart as I am (as I said already) you'll laugh and chuckle your way through the best couple of hours of entertainment you could wish for."

","Seriously, this movie was terrible. Poorly edited, the story has next to no plot. It's all subplots, really, with no overarching purpose. The producers themselves basically gave up, as there's no sound in this movie—literally, there will be minutes of silence on screen, like there's no situational soundtrack. Very odd. The actors save the movie, sort of: Hill and McDormand get one scene each, basically. Scarlett is barely in the film. There's a lot of Brolin, but that's about it. The best scene is the Tatum dance scene, and it's very hard to even think of a second scene in the movie that was actually good. The Ben Hur jokes are kind of funny if you get them, and Clooney is okay. But yeah, mostly you're just waiting for the film to end so you can leave. Since this movie wasn't released in Oscar season, you know it had to be less than stellar. But no one could have predicted such a train wreck of a story and overall movie. Don't both ever seeing this movie: IT IS TERRIBLE. To see critics giving it all these good grades defies logic. Great cast, terrible writing, because the cast actually has to have a purpose to make it a great film."
"Screen_Blitz","7","2","5","14 February 2016"," Another pleasant surprise from the Coen Brothers
","Joel and Ethan Coen, the geniuses behind 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', O Brother Where Are Thou' and 'No Country for Old Men, are back once again, and have delivered splendid surprise with this period set comedy-drama starring an exhilarating cast of some of the biggest actors to shine in Hollywood today. This film set in the 1950s, places Josh Brolin in the role of Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood studio executive of a company known as ""Capitol Pictures"", a studio company filming their new motion picture titled ""Hail Caeser"" which stars a hotshot actor Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney) as a messiah warrior in a biblical story set in Ancient Rome. However, when Whitlock is drugged and mysteriously abducted, Eddie must get his head in the game and keep the actors and staff workers of the industry in line, including a attractive swimmer DeeAnna Moran who becomes pregnant during production (played by Scarlett Johansson), a singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (played by Alden Ehrenreich) who must deal with an ill-tempered film director (played by Ralph Fiennes), and a sailor-suited dancer Burt Gurney (played by Channing Tatum). Jonah Hill makes an appearance as the financial agent.<br/><br/>This film is filled with almost everything you can expect from a movie directed by the Coen Brothers: engaging characters, stellar performances, and a solid screenplay. This film is both funny and energetic at various points, with its story set in the Hollywood industry during the post-World War II era. Joel and Ethan Coen make great use with the story with the idea poking fun at Hollywood with clever social commentary and diving into the hypocrisy and corruption that goes on behind the camera. While the story does have some flaws in terms of consistency with its overflowing subplots thrown at every turn, it moves considerably well. Throughout the run time, we are treated with some of most masterful scenes including an stylish musical number by Channing Tatum who demonstrates an impressive dance routine, Scarlett Johansson performing a musical opera with her exotic swim skills, and a powerful cinematic-fueled monologue by George Clooney's character. Then the story dips into the scandalous behavior including communism which was a major threat to Hollywood back in the 50s, committed by the stars and crew members and the dishonesty that drives the production into trouble. These scenes paint such a dazzling picture at the Hollywood environment in the 1950s. And with the colorful production design that gives the scenes a moody and eye-popping 50s-style look really stands as a work of art.<br/><br/>With such a stellar cast, incredible performances are what many can only ask for. Josh Brolin gives stunning performance as the main character who must deal with the atrocities that go on when their production goes to utter hell. George Clooney shines bright in his role as the actor starring in a historical motion picture that pays a good homage to 1959 classic 'Ben-Hur', and the monologues his character delivers in the filming scenes are quite entertaining to watch. Channing Tatum is also quite impressive in his role, playing a Gene Kelly-like character and performing a catchy tap dance on the counter and tables at a bar, while delivering a shocking singing voice. Scarlett Johansson and Ralph Fiennes are both good, but is sadly underused for the most of the time. Serving even less screen time is Jonah Hill as the financial agent of the company. The fact that the his character has very little screen time is quite a shame as he gives a credible acting for his time on-screen. Alden Ehrenreich is probably one of the best actors here, playing a cowboy with an archetype of Kirby Giant. <br/><br/>Hail, Ceaser! is a great work of art by the Coen Brothers and an inspiring take on the satire of Hollywood. This is film sparkled with tremendous performances, a great screenplay, dazzling characters, and let's not forget the profound cinematography by Roger Deakins. Maybe not the best of their works, but it still deserves our attention. Hail, Ceaser is a movie every Coen Brothers should see."

Only one knowledgeable of typical Gene Kelly, Esther Williams musicals, Roy Rogers/Gene Autry (can't remember which) westerns would actually ""get"" any of the material they're trying to poke fun at. Another cliché, the old Christian epic (Ben Hur, The Robe, etc), is made fun of but in a kind of strange offbeat manner, almost semi-serious but obviously satire. And it seems that blacklisted screen writers association with, or accused of associating with communists has become a Hollywood cliché (maybe after the release of Trumbo last year?), for the Coen boys languishingly poke fun at that too. You might actually ""get in"" to an actually well produced dance ensemble, but will have to check yourself - ""Wait, this is a spoof. I should be laughing at this, not actually enjoying the dancing itself."" It's almost like the Coen brothers are saying, ""Gotcha!"" As if they're mocking your reaction, not the old, Hollywood clichés themselves. Who knows? Who cares? I only spent money to get in to see the ""Deadpool"" which my kids roped me into taking them.

"jadepietro","6","2","5","11 February 2016"," Not Much to Laud
","(RATING: ☆☆½ out of 4) <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: The comedy can be found in the Coen Brother's film, but it's sporadic mayhem at best, thanks mostly to a wonderful cast. <br/><br/>GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Journey back to the heyday of the Hollywood film studios and their bevy of stars who lit up the movie screens! The Coen Brothers' latest film, Hail Caesar, still has its stars acting aces, production values that wow, but not much to laud with a tiresome plot that barely comes together.<br/><br/>￼The film is an homage to the old Hollywood system, but it rarely builds to an absurd laugh-out- loud farce, rather settling on intellectualizing debates about faith and redemption during the Red Scare of the 50's. (However, I did have a non-stop grin on my face throughout the film.) The direction by Ethan and Joel Coen remains solid as they mock and worship these celebrities with their high cheekbones and chiseled physiques, ill-equipped to handle life, let alone fame and fortune. On the studio's roster are such choice characters, both behind and in front of the cameras. At the forefront is Eddie Mannix (a highly effective Josh Brolin) whose 24 / 7 job at Capital Pictures Studio is to put out the many fires ignited by the studios' acting talents (?). His clients include: DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an Esther Williams bombshell who wisecracks and grouses her way through every take, Hobie Doyle (a breakout performance by Alden Ehrenreich, channeling a Sal Mineo vulnerability to perfection) as an empty-headed Western star, Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum, making Gene Kelly proud) playing a song and dance man, and Baird Whitlick (an amusing George Clooney) as a rugged leading man type starring in a ripe religious epic in the style of vintage Ben Hur but without the class.<br/><br/>￼Adding to Mannix's problematic issues are Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) as a temperamental film director (but then who wouldn't be with this stars), Tilda Swinton as dueling gossip columnists, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, and in an all-too-short scenes, C.C. Calhoun (a funny Frances McDormand) as a frustrated film editor and an unethical agent named Joseph Silverman (Jonah Hill). The ensemble is flawless and wondrously dopey, but they are let down by a screenplay that never aligns or engages its characters.<br/><br/>￼The film succeeds in mixing other genres (film noir, musical comedy, screwball comedy, Biblical spectacle) and this pastiche are the film's highlights. As long as the film remains on the studio stages, the film works. Were Hail Caesar! to focus more on these marvelous parodies, the movie would be a memorable classic bit about Old Hollywood. Instead it veers off course with subplots about Communist writers, a kidnapping plot, and religious affirmation scenes which goes on far too long without much merriment or laughs. The tone becomes stiflingly serious and labored and one wants more time spent on the wacky antics from these Hollywood types lost on the film set.<br/><br/>Still, there are so many standout moments to revel: Tatum's energetic six minute tongue- definitely-in-cheek dance number entitled ""No Dames"", Johansson's Busby Berkeley synchronized swim spoof, McDormand's all-too-short stint, Ehrenreich's singing cowboy's lack of intellectual sparring with the overtly sophisticated Fiennes, Clooney's exasperated buffoonery, etc. This ensemble creates vivid and interesting characters ready to leap to screwball heights but they are weighed down by a screenplay that misses so many golden opportunities to become a riotous comedy. The parodies are spot-on, the plot is duller than need be.<br/><br/>As previously stated, the film is a well-crafted look at Tinseltown, with kudos to the astute production design by Jess Gonchor, lovely period costumes by Mary Zophres, and Technicolor- inspired camera-work by the prolific Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>￼If the plot itself tends to meander all over the place and, too often, loses some of its light- weight footing, the small pockets of perfected glee from the Coen's inspired cast of delightful characters make the film a pleasant enough diversion. Here, it's the individual scenes of the film, the movie-within-the movie segments, which more than make up for the many missteps in this disappointing film.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","Hollywood in the Fifties is a never-ending grind if you are Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). As the go-to guy for Capitol Movie Studios, Eddie has many a tangle to smooth. First, the studios need a ""star"" replacement for an elegant period piece but the only one available is singing cowboy Hobie (Alden Ehrenreich). Although the head honcho insists on this substitute, poor Hobie is a stretch for the role, irritating famed director Lawrence Laurents (Ralph Fiennes). Then, water ballet film star DeeAnna (Scarlet Johansson) is a divorcée with a big problem; she's pregnant and unmarried. But these two issues are small peanuts when handsome major actor Baird (George Clooney) gets kidnapped before his final big scene in a Biblical epic Hail Caesar. In addition, Lockheed Air is after Eddie, too, as his managerial skills are priceless. Ransom is set at $100,000. Amid twin sister gossip writers (Tilda Swinton) breathing over Mannix's shoulder, a cutting room editor (Frances McDormand) smoking and choking, Baird's hoped-for return, and Eddie's daily trips to confession, will the show go on at Capitol Studios? This clever, interesting and funny film is not the Coens best but still very enjoyable. The cast is the major asset, with Brolin on top as the man who keeps it all running. Johansson, McDormand, Clooney, Fiennes, Swinton, Jonah Hill, Ehrenreich, Channing Tatum and ALL of the rest are just fantastic. The recreation of the Fifties is also superb in costumes, sets, themes, sight gags, send-ups, and more. Finally, as the principal writers and directors, the Coens are worthy of much praise for their risk taking ventures, even when it all doesn't QUITE result in matchless film making. A Happy Hail to the Coens, absolutely. May they never cease crafting their works until its impossible for them to move."

"petergrump1","7","4","14","5 February 2016"," Hail, Casear!; Film of Films!
","The Coen Brothers are certainly some of the greatest living directors working today. Their films have become very famous for paying homage to older films while at the same time managing to change and combine genres giving their reputation as genre-benders. Some examples of this are the black comedy- thriller, Fargo, the contemporary western, No Country For Old Men, and the supernatural horror- drama- black comedy- genre defying Barton Fink. These films are considered some of the greatest of all time and for their new film, Hail, Caesar!, they have attempted to create a film that is every genre of the past at once that can be seen as either a fun homage or a disorienting mess.<br/><br/>Even though the plot and characters are fictional it follows the real life Eddie Mannix who was a Hollywood executive during the first half of the twentieth century best known as a ""fixer"". The story takes place during one day in the early 1950s and Mannix (Josh Brolin) has to solve the problems of the day in the film studio where he works at, most notably the kidnapping of movie star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). However, the plot is rather superficial as most of the movie is watching movies that are being made by people in the film studio. It sounds a bit odd, but since part of Mannix's job is watching movies and making sure they are on the right track that is what a majority of the film is and it is a very clever way in which the Coens are able to create more films within the film. With almost each one being a different genre the Coens create a western, an epic, a romantic drama, a noir, a submarine film and a musical all within the 100 minute run time. The film studio itself feels very alive and fleshed out with everybody always doing something and the film has a constant energy. Characters come and ago sometimes without any background as if the audience is already supposed to know who they are which is rather fitting since most of the characters are movie stars. The film drops you into its world and without a story to guide you through it can become really confusing and disorientating quickly. However, it truly doesn't seem like a film that cares much about telling a great story, but more about writing a love letter to the glamour age of Hollywood. More of a film for the filmmaker than for the audience. Trying to fully comprehend what is happening at all times in the film is nearly impossible and arguably unnecessary it seems more like a film that is better being viewed for all the love and energy being put into it.<br/><br/>On the production side, the film is perfectly cast even though some performances can last only a few minutes all the actors add a certain amount of humor by incorporating a certain part of themselves into the performance. For example, George Clooney plays a naive character due to his movie stardom status who seems to just take everything as it comes to him and it only makes it funnier because George Clooney one of the most respected actors today is playing him. The cinematography by frequent Coens Brother collaborator Roger Deakins is beautiful managing to change every time the genre changes to really add to the experience, When it's a musical the film is very colorful and vivid and when it becomes a noir dark shadows are cast and it begins to rain.<br/><br/>While certainly not the Coens best film, with knowledge of early Hollywood and the types of films that came out of it the film is a fun love letter to the glamour age of cinema that will most likely be enjoyed most by cinephiles."

","Hail Caesar is, granted, not the Coen Brothers strongest film but it is a great love song from the Coen Brothers to an industry that they live in. Its truly a film made by a couple of film nerds to appeal to other film nerds. Much in the way Singin in the Rain was about the movie industry in the 1930s adjusting to a major development in the way of talkies as told by the 1950s; Hail, Caesar is about the movie industry in the 1950s dealing with the pitfalls of celebrity image as told by the 2010s, a time that knows a lot about train wrecked celebs. This film deals with closeted homosexuality (ON THE WINGS OF EAGLES), communism, pregnancy out of wedlock, and being caught up in an image that the studio can't make money off of. Its surrounds a studio ""fixer"" who has to keep up with the humanity of these celebrities and make sure their image fits 1950s sentiments and don't conflict with the goals of the studio that basically owns them. Such as his ability to turn Scarlett Johansson's Deanna Moran getting pregnant by a married director, into a humanitarian effort in arranging for her to adopt her own child. It manages to show what goes on inside the ""golden age"" of Hollywood and that celebrities didn't start being train wrecks in 2005, its just we're much worse at hiding it now.<br/><br/>Also I don't understand why Jonah Hill and Scarlett Johansson had pictures on the poster but Alden Ehrenreich and Tilda Swinton didn't. They had way more to do with the plot and much bigger parts."

","For those of us who enjoy movies made in the Golden age of the silver screen and are fans, you'll love Hail, Caesar! even more as it is the perfect satire to that era, pin pointing certain issue of the time, like Alden Ehrenreich playing Hobie Doyle, an actor so perfectly type cast as a Cowboy that he can't do anything else. One of the funniest parts in the movie is when Ralph Fiennes who plays a director tries to give the Heavy accent buckaroo dialog lessons. Scarlett Johansson playing an American sweetheart whose being forced by the studio to marry, so that she will not have her baby out of wedlock. Then there's the part of the movie which reflects how a lot of screenwriters who wrote some of Hollywood's biggest pictures of the time had interest in the Communist party, which makes me reminisce of the Bryan Cranston starring film, Trumbo.<br/><br/>I'm surprise how little an element of homophobia was mixed into the content, but I guess that is a cliché done too many times.<br/><br/>All of this was being kept in line by Hollywood Fixer, Eddie Mannix played by Josh Brolin, in what seem to be just a normal day at the office, which happens to include the kidnapping of a major movie star, played by Major movie star, George Clooney, just before he was about to finished the final scene of Capital Studios' biggest film of the year, Hail, Caesar!<br/><br/>Advertised in the trailer to be the main plot, the kidnapping feels as much of a subplot as everything else, but does intertwine with the other subplots more regularly, with the main plot being more about the duties of Eddie Mannix in the Star System of Hollywood, so don't get too wrapped up in the plot, because it does not work too well as a linear narrative, that's not the point, the point is that the movie does a brilliant job of reflecting that time and era, with a slightly surrealistic approach that was golden age Hollywood. Even using CGI backdrops that make the film look like it was made in a sound stage of the 1950s.<br/><br/>It's another great Cohen Brothers movie worth getting into."

","Hail Caesar! is great fun, following the adventures of a group of characters all involved with the fictional Capitol Pictures first seen in the Coen brothers film Barton Fink(but, more than a decade later.) At a few times this is its greatest weakness though, jumping from story to story to story without returning to the last one for a long time. Not to worry though, as almost all of the stories coalesce together at the end.<br/><br/>The stories are all linked by the central character, Eddie Mannix, a fixer for the studio who deals with potential bad PR and assorted other problems. Over the course of three days he has to deal with various troublesome actors, religious moral watchdog groups, a pair of nosy gossip columnists, an old studio scandal, and the main story the kidnapping of Hail Caesar!'s star. All of this while having his own problem of balancing his stressful job and a family at home.<br/><br/>Hail Caesar! is a great look at the movie industry back in the waning studio days of the 1950's. I would have dropped the sailor movie bit as it slows the film down and serves no purpose, but for the most part the film is a hilarious hoot that those aware of the golden days of Hollywood will enjoy immensely."

We tend to stick to a few key characters, and it is a shame we have strong actors like Scarlett Johansson who do not receive a lot of screen time even though they make up the ensemble cast.<br/><br/>As this was advertised as a comedy it would have been nice to see more humor in the movie, though even though there are a few key moments that are funny, all of these moments are hilarious. A lot of these moments happen to be focused around a character named Hobie who is an action-star-turned-speaking-actor, and his interaction with Ralph Fiennes proves to be comedic gold. Also, pay attention for a segment with the premiere of a movie Hobie stars in called ""Lazy Ol' Moon."" It makes older movies look like caricatures.<br/><br/>What holds the film together is that while it is made up of an ensemble cast, there are only a few stories to follow, so it is difficult to get lost in these stories. Some of the stories are more enticing than the others, however, but you will find them to be intertwined so it all makes sense.<br/><br/>The direction of this movie still shows the Coen brothers are strong directors. The movie looks brilliant, the art direction makes it very believable that we are experiencing old Hollywood, and there are extremely well-choreographed and well-executed sequences. This is a good Coen brothers films, but it is not that high on the list compared to the rest of their canon.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"
"Turin_Horse","9","2","6","1 May 2016"," A great film!... and misunderstood by quite a few around here it seems.
","In Barton Fink, maybe the best Coen's movie so far, the introspective story of a screenplay writer in Hollywood's 30's is told. Coming from a totally different world, John Turturro's personage is engulfed by the pitiless machinery of the Hollywood industry.<br/><br/>We move some 15 years ahead and we are there again, same place, and pretty much the same story, but told in an totally different way, with comedy prevailing over drama (many of the commentators here seem actually to have entirely missed this last part, I'm sorry for them), and several story threads going their own way or intermingling with each other instead of a straight symbolic story with just 2-3 personages like in Barton.<br/><br/>The film is as much a homage to Hollywood as it is a sharp criticism. The number of references to classical Hollywood (films, actors, stories...) is uncountable, and only those who are true film lovers and have some background in cinema history, and actually history in general, will be able to fully enjoy it (might this be the reason why so many seem to be disappointed and delivering bad, and totally foolish, criticism...)<br/><br/>The screenplay is one of the most intelligent in films about filmmaking. The comedy parts are great, but that's just an aspect of the film, which has a lot more to dig into, although often disguised as a comedy, which may have mislead many fellow commentators around here.<br/><br/>Ave Cesar shows how filmmaking actually is, or was in retrospective back in the 50's; showing for instance the hard work behind a wonderfully crafted scene when we see it on the screen (someone here complained about the scared expression of Scarlett Johansson when role-playing an Esther Williams' alter ego!!!, is it possible he didn't realize that that expression was meant exactly to be like that???). This is just an example, but go see the film, and you will find lots like this. Then add a general tone of comedy, some crazy story threads like the one of the communist group kidnapping poor ""Messala"" (McCarthy was right in the end!!!), and you get Hail Caesar!, for sure one of the best films this year. But do not expect a plain comedy or you may end up disappointed. <br/><br/>A last hint, pay attention to two scenes: the encounter of the Roman centurion with Jesus Christ, look at the color of Christ's hair... then the final speech of this centurion at the foot of the cross and the effect it has on the audience there (the technical staff working in the film)... there is a lot to dig into in those two simple and, apparently, just comedic scenes, as there is throughout the film, but you will have to be a bit insightful to fully enjoy it."

","Such a fantastic film that people just don't seem to get. I've read reviews that complain about the plot, or scenes which do not appear to be relevant, but clearly they do not understand what the film is about. ""Hail, Caesar!"" depicts a day in the life of Eddie Mannix, and the mad, often random events of the film are supposed to reflect the busy nature of his job. Excellent work from the Coen brothers, and an absolutely superb performance from Josh Brolin, who held the entire film together. At times this reminded me of the Big Lebowski, specifically its laid back tone. Perhaps not a film for everyone, but certainly not just for ""film snobs."" However, I'm not sure why they plastered Jonah Hill's face all over their marketing, as he had less than 5 minutes on screen."
"shavixmir","9","2","6","1 March 2016"," Spot on.
","I think a lot of reviewers are missing the point. The film is a cynical look at Hollywood. Every single scene is linked in a sarcastic POV at what's happening behind the screens. <br/><br/>Take, for example, the opening. When Saul of Tarsus is portrayed as an impoverished individual when transformed into Paul (he was a Roman citizen and persecutor of Christians at that point) and the mentioning of ""the Frankish road"" (the Franks weren't about at that time). Then you get the religious debate. The inconsistencies are not important to those gathered in the meeting; just the image of Jesus, how it could reflect on the church and if it's going to alienate groups of potential customers. <br/><br/>Take, for example, the dance scene. Openly gay, yet singing about missing women whilst they are at sea. And the director is gay. Not important in itself, but when linked to Clooney's character getting his break through role by having sex with said director it's an abuse issue. <br/><br/>Another example: The kidnappers are drooping exaggerated dialectic (communist philosophy) reasoning. They believe in something. Their handler obviously doesn't (favouring a dog he doesn't want over a lot of money for the ""Just cause""). It's abusive. And Clooney's character sees their point. But when he voices it it gets beaten out of him. It's abuse. <br/><br/>I think suggesting the film is unhinged or just a string of pointless scenes is not doing it justice at all. It's layer upon layer of shallowness and abuse.<br/><br/>And Brolin's only redeeming feature is that he chooses to keep up the abuse, rather than settle for a job in the nuclear weapons industry. How harsh is that!"

","Hail, Caesar is the Coen brothers doing what they do best. This movie is along the same vein as the big lebowski where the humour is dry but humour there is. From the outrageous musical number to the outrageous plot. People who are bad mouthing this movie are obviously not Coen fans. I love it. I thoroughly love the idea of this film as a sort of insight into the world of movies in the 50s. I read some horrible reviews going in and knew then that it would be a typical Coen film.

"Dan1863Sickles","1","1","2","26 March 2020"," A Movie Only Neville Sinclair Could Love!
","Lots of reviewers have already pointed out how shallow, ugly, tasteless and unfunny this massively annoying little movie really is. What I want to do is examine some of the underlying themes by comparing it to a movie from the early Nineties that I really loved, THE ROCKETEER.<br/><br/>These two movies have so much in common, yet they're very different. The Rocketeer was a feelgood popcorn film aimed at a family audience. Hail Caesar is an art house movie aimed at the elite. Yet both of them are period pictures that both spoof and celebrate classic Hollywood. Both movies feature a main character who is supposed to be a legendary movie star, a sexy screen idol at the height of his career. Both Baird Whitlock in Hail Caesar and Neville Sinclair in Rocketeer are quickly revealed to be very different from the heroic characters they play onscreen.<br/><br/>So here's where it gets interesting. The bland family movie actually presents a much darker, more disturbing, and arguably more honest look at Hollywood than the hip satire. With Baird Whitlock, the Coen brothers cop out. He's not a bad man, he's just stunningly self-involved, childishly naive, weak and silly. It's purely accidental (and supposedly hilarious) when he gets mixed up with a bunch of Communists trying to infiltrate Hollywood. They kidnap him and lecture him on Communist doctrine. And he sits there. Looking confused. And that's hilarious, really funny. Only not. At all!<br/><br/>Now look at Neville Sinclair. He's nobody's pawn. He's a Nazi spy and he likes it. He's genuinely cruel, cunning, sadistic and brutal. He doesn't think twice about hiring mob killers to help him cover up his treason. He revels in his plans to bring down America. And you know what? He's also a sexual predator who very nearly pulls off a Harvey style rape scene with a genuinely innocent and appealing young ingenue. None of that is funny, but see, it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be real, and it is. And it feels even tougher and more honest now than it was in 1991!<br/><br/>I'm a big CLOCKWORK ORANGE fan, and I wish that George Clooney and the Coen brothers could be strapped into their seats and forced to viddy THE ROCKETEER over and over again, until they begin to feel very, very sick!"

","Do you love movies? I mean really love them? The Coen's clearly do and the more I watch this one, the more I love them and this movie too. Yes, it's not perfect. Like The Big Lebowski was for me, it's an acquired taste. Some of the reviews seem to totally miss the point or just not get the heart of it. Some missed the opportunity to truly catch the romance, and I mean Ethan and Joel's lasting love affair with both the art and substance of movie making, and it makes me sad for them. This movie is about the passion and purpose of movie making. It's the ""right thing to do"". That's after all, that's ""what God wants us to do"". Father Ethan and Joel, ""I get it now"".<br/><br/>So watch it. And watch again, and maybe watch it again. I hope you find that, like me, maybe you'll begin to fall in love with movies in a deeper, more affectionate way than you ever have before."

","A rambling shaggy dog story set in Hollywood of the 1950's ... a movie star (George Clooney) is kidnapped off the set of a Biblical epic he's starring in. There are a couple of distinct but related subplots, and all of it ties back to studio exec Josh Brolin trying to put out all the fires while considering a better job offer from Lockheed. Every once in a while, the Coens make a film simply because it amuses them and allows them to exercise their love of classic Hollywood. This is one of those. They stage multiple scenes from films being made by this studio ... musicals, westerns, comedies, epics ... and each is a meticulously recreated pastiche of a 50's film. If you're on their wavelength, it's immensely rewarding. If you're not, it's a bunch of stars gathered together for a plot that ultimately goes almost nowhere. I'm in the first camp ... I loved this."

"aciessi","4","1","2","14 March 2017"," A Pretty-Looking Dud
","The Coen brothers have done just about everything right for most of their careers. Their line of work is diverse, and fabulously off-beat. They find the humor and horror of both real and absurd situations. Hail, Caesar must be another hit, right? I sat through most of the film beside myself. It's a tribute to post-war, old-Hollywood, which is great and all.. but this was marketed as a comedy, and I never laughed. Where were the jokes? The irony? There is plenty of humor to be had at this bygone era, and the Coens didn't explore. The film relies heavily on perfectly constructed, whimsical set pieces and the pretty faces of it's all-star ensemble cast. Glitz and glamour only takes a film so far. If the story and characters are hollow, everything else will be. The critics adored this when it came out last year, which just goes to show you how much these old fossils love gushing over themselves and the industry they represent. This is not one of the Coen's finer hours. I guess if i didn't like this, I better never consider watching Rules Don't Apply? Yeah, sounds like a good idea to me."
"bbrebozo","4","1","2","25 February 2017"," Disjointed
","Was this a comedy? A drama? Who knows! I had a ""Free HBO"" weekend earlier this month, so I took advantage of it to watch Hail Caesar, a movie that sounded pretty good when I saw the trailer a few years ago. But I was younger and stupider then.<br/><br/>Was it a comedy? If so, why wasn't it funny? ""Would that it twere so simple"" stopped being funny long before they finally stopped saying it.<br/><br/>Was it a drama? If so, why didn't it keep me at the edge of my seat? The movie opens with George Clooney's character being kidnapped, and leaves us in suspense as to why. Well, not that much suspense, really. I stayed with this film for over an hour before I finally turned it off. I still don't know why he was kidnapped. And I don't care. And never will.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson was solid as a hard-bitten 1930's type movie star. But George Clooney was just ... George Clooney in a toga. If he had walked into the studio cold and read his lines from cue cards, I don't think his performance would have been substantially different. Or perhaps we were supposed to believe that George Clooney in a toga is an inherently funny premise, and the mere sight of it would keep us in stitches throughout the movie? There were also a lot of pointless scenes. The swimming musical number at the beginning could easily have been cut out of the movie without losing anything. But then again, so could most of the other scenes in the movie. I understand from some previous reviewers that the swimming scene was intended to be a homage to the Esther Williams movies of the 1930's and 1940's. And indeed it was -- if ""homage"" is French for boring pointless imitation.<br/><br/>Because I didn't watch the last half hour, I have to confess that the ending could well be a thrilling laugh-filled adventure that pulls the whole movie together and leaves the audience stunned with the brilliance of the film and its commentary on both Depression-era and contemporary Hollywood. Unfortunately, I'll never know. And don't intend to find out."
"jacobs-greenwood","4","1","2","3 February 2017"," Thinks it's more clever than it is
","As a paean to Hollywood, it hits all the stereotypical notes; in other words, it's not very original. While it seems obvious that the Coen brothers have an affection for this country's cinematic roots, Hail, Caesar! is as shallow as it is glossy in its representation of the studio era, the behind- the-scenes exploits of its actors and directors, and (therefore) the need for a ""fixer"" like Eddie Mannix, who was a real person that's played by Josh Brolin.<br/><br/>The directors have included countless anecdotes to that time's well worn lore, but provide no unique insights or viewpoint. Because many of these references are obscure, they're likely of little value to a general audience; because they're too glib, they may even offend cinephiles. Overall, the film is rather mundane. That the movie's production design was nominated for an Academy Award is also surprising in that it appears to have been crafted to be on the same level of a Universal Studios tour attraction."
"m-guszak-1","4","1","2","8 January 2017"," Poorly Developed Plot and Characters
","Let's be honest, with a movie made by the Coen brothers comes expectations. This movie fails mightily in regards to those expectations. Don't get me wrong, the movie is beautifully shot and Brolin is solid as always in the lead. The problem with this movie is a horribly undeveloped plot and characters that are never developed or really significant at all to the story. You see this big name cast advertised, but for no reason whatsoever. Outside of Brolin and Clooney, practically no other characters are on screen for more than a couple of minutes, or are relevant to the story. Scarlett Johansson is completely irrelevant to the story, as is Channing Tatum. Jonah Hill phones in a bit part that had no point in even existing. The only supporting actor that really shines in their brief time on screen is Alden Ehrenreich, who is terrific. Sadly, he is introduced and then exits just as fast. This was a halfhearted effort by two very talented but bored filmmakers. They really did not have an idea for a complete movie, just a neat idea for a skit, a skit with no legs. I am a huge Coen fan, but this was pretentious and a waste of time.."
"mnpollio","3","1","2","6 January 2017"," Some good scenes and performances, but overall a misfire
","A film by the Coen Brothers is always worth checking out, but contrary to their reputation they can either achieve cinematic brilliance (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men) or excruciating lows (Intolerable Cruelty, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou), and a number of in-betweens. Hail, Caesar is definitely not one of their crowning achievements.<br/><br/>The story is set in the heyday of the big Hollywood film studios and centers on studio ""fixer"" wheeler-dealer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) detailing the various fires he must put out in order to keep production rolling on some the studios future hits. Aside from the usual, Mannix must contend with the ostensible kidnapping of the studio's most popular leading man (George Clooney) from the set of a Ben-Hur style biblical epic by a cabal of Communists and ward off the machinations of twin sister gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton) on the trail of big scandals.<br/><br/>The film should be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it missteps entirely too often and has huge dead spots. The obvious problems with the film hit the viewer pretty quickly. Eddie Mannix was actually a real figure, but the sanitized do-gooder that we see here bears no resemblance to the real thing. Brolin is an amazingly talented actor, but here he is forced to play everything straight as the film's purported anchor, which ends up making Eddie more than a bit of a drag in the central role. In fact, Brolin/Eddie is so stiff here as to be painful.<br/><br/>Worse, the only time the film comes to glorious life and gives us an idea of what a success it could have been, is when it recreates in cheeky fashion some of the set pieces from yesteryear Hollywood. Alas, these moments are too few and far between, as the film gets bogged down in the tedious and criminally unfunny kidnapping plot, which takes up too much screen time and is never as amusing or subversive as the filmmakers believe. Every time we detour to Clooney and his kidnappers, you can almost hear the sigh of frustration from the audience.<br/><br/>An amazing cast has been compiled for the film, but a number of them are wasted. Blink and you may well miss Frances McDormand as a daffy editor or Jonah Hill as a professional patsy. Scarlett Johansson gets a nice homage to Esther Williams spectacles and shines briefly as a tough-talking actress, but is underused. Ditto, Channing Tatum, who dazzles with a Gene Kelly-esque sailor dance routine before being utterly wasted. Clooney hams it up nicely, but he is saddled with the film's worst subplot which pretty much hogties his performance. If there is a standout, it is newcomer Alden Ehrenreich as a Gene Autry-type singing cowboy. Ehrenreich seems to be one of the few acting like he is in a comedy and is perfectly believable as the nice guy rube. Some of the film's few highlights are courtesy of him being forced to step in as a last minute replacement as lead in a British comedy of manners. His miscasting is hilarious and sets off director Ralph Fiennes into spasms of apoplexy.<br/><br/>Alas, the misses far outnumber the hits. The tiresome kidnapping plot that dominates the screen time is ultimately pointless. Between the respectable recreations of old-style Hollywood splendor set pieces, most viewers will be checking their watch. The film is episodic and haphazard - it also needs a decent editor to remove what bits simply do not work. The whole thing culminates into a disappointing viewing experience."

","What do you do when you want to have a hoot, to have a little downtime? Well, you and I might ring a few friends, get a few cans of lager, find a guitar and throw an impromptu party. And what to the Coen brothers do (that's Joel and Ethan to you and I) when they just want to do nothing but let their hair down? Why, they make a film, that's what. That's what being worth several million and having a Tinseltown backstory of commercial success allows you to do. And Hail Caesar is that film. Is it any good? Well, not really, no. In fact, not at all.<br/><br/>Granted - given that Tinseltown backstory and the investors rubbing their hands in anticipation - no expense is spared, and the Coen's latest has high production values, a full stable of stars - Clooney, Swinton, Brolin, Johansson, Fiennes and Tatum pop up (George, Tilda, Josh, Scarlett, 'Rafe and Channing to the Coens, no doubt) - one or two good lines and oodles of great camera shots, but dear hearts it is all for naught: Hail Caesar is just not very good. And it might well have been panned had any others but the saintly Coens been at the helm.<br/><br/>I read just the other day that Hail Caesar was made after the brothers had completed scripts for several blockbusters, you know, the kind of films deemed to be 'possible Oscar winners' - Bridge Of Spies and Unbroken were just two - and the suggestion was that they wanted just to take it a little easy for a change.<br/><br/>Well, Hail Caesar was the result. Bitty, potentially interesting but in practice rather dull, and - am I really going to say this? Yes, I am - pretty incoherent. The budget was an estimated $22 million and the take so far has been almost ten times that, so the backstory gets another chapter and the investors will indulge the brothers further. But for what? There's half a story, and several other quarter stories, none thought out but apparently merely sketched on the back of a Malibu restaurant menu, and then away it was. George, Tilda, Josh, Scarlett, 'Rafe and Channing, most hardly seen except for a few scenes and except for Brolin who plays what I suppose must be described as 'the central character', pretty much phone in their performances before taking off to weightier projects.<br/><br/>The exception, perhaps, was young Alden Ehrenreich, who was able to flesh out rather nicely a part as small as all the others, but whose name I shall keep a look out for (he's still quite young), but even his performance goes no way to redeeming what to be frank is so sketchy it couldn't even be called a vanity project.<br/><br/>Some themes are touched upon much as you and I - who, of course, are just ordinary schmucks - might pick consider picking up a bargain in the supermarket, then replacing it after losing interest within seconds and moving on. This takes place in the early Fifties and there's some slender sub-plot about a gang of Communist lefty writers kidnapping and holding to ransom a big star, Clooney. There's another sub-plot of a young starlet having to be married off somehow given that she will be dropping a kid in a few months, but that also remains resolutely and remorselessly undeveloped.<br/><br/>There's a further, quite baffling, sub-plot about Brolin's Tinseltown fixer Eddie Mannix (the real one was apparently a nasty piece of work, but that's just by the by) being wooed to jack it all in and take over leading Lockheed, the plane makers. Why we aren't told and that, too, is left so sketchy as to be pretty much irrelevant.<br/><br/>So there you have it: the Coens have fun and let their hair down and have a good time. Trouble is, I didn't, and you might or might not either. So if this comes your way, look around for meatier fare before settling in, or even consider taking down a good book from the shelf and do a bit of reading instead.

","At the end of watching Hail Caesar, I turned to my girlfriend and said, ""that was not a movie.""<br/><br/>And yet, it does have much in common with movies. There is a story, kind of. There are characters. There are some entertaining scenes. And yet...<br/><br/>I wasn't actually thinking ""this wasn't a movie"" while I watched it. There was a basic story involving a studio executive handling various emergencies and secondary stories involving a kidnapped actor and a miscast cowboy. There was an excellent cast (although so many actors that few get much screen time), including a wonderful Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists. While it started slow, the movie had entertaining moments, including a fun Busby Berkley-style swim number, an amusing attempt to get the cowboy to deliver a single line correctly, and a first-rate tap/swing number.<br/><br/>But at the end, it just felt like there was nothing there. The movie is built on the very slight scaffold of the executive's decision on whether to move to a different industry, and because you never care about him (he's a classically generic, faceless character), you don't really care what he decides.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is simply scenes from fictional movies, including a Ben Hur variant. I say variant rather than take-off or parody because the attempts seems more to mimic the style of these films than to burlesque them. The result is not quite parody and not quite tribute.<br/><br/>If the Coen Brothers wanted to make a bunch of old-Hollywood style scenes, they would have been better served to simply make their version of an old-Hollywood movie (as they did with Hudsucker Proxy) than to make this odd pastiche."

It is his job to keep everything together, running smoothly, trying to keep actors, directors, and gossip columnists happy. It is a humorous look at the studio system of movie-making in the 1950s.<br/><br/>Mannix is a genuine guy, in the opening scene we see him going to confession, it had only been 24 hours since his last confession. His big sin, smoking 2 or 3 cigarettes and telling his wife he had quit. But all the other characters are quite different from what they seem to be in their on- screen roles.<br/><br/>George Clooney is Baird Whitlock, the studio's biggest star, finishing up filming of the Roman epic ""Hail, Caesar."" But Whitlock is a misfit, a drunkard, and a womanizer. One day his wine on-set is drugged, he is kidnapped, and when he wakes up he is in the presence of a group of Hollywood Communists. Instead of being offended he is curious and quickly begins to see merit in their way of thinking. Mannix has to find Whitlock, they can't finish the movie without him and costs are escalating.<br/><br/>Alden Ehrenreich is Hobie Doyle, himself a star in the western genre, he can ride and rope but he had never actually acted with spoken lines. The studio pulls him to fill in another role where he has to dress and speak in a more formal setting but try as he might just wasn't a right fit.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is DeeAnna Moran who stars in Esther Williams types of indoor water extravaganzas. But off the set she is a rough talker and finds herself pregnant. That would be bad publicity so Mannix has a great idea, why doesn't she just have the baby quietly and then adopt her own child?<br/><br/>Maybe the best performance is by Tilda Swinton in two parts, twin sisters Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker, competing gossip columnists. Then there is Channing Tatum as Burt Gurney, currently starring in a Gene Kelly type of US Navy movie where he sings and dances.<br/><br/>The writer-director's wife, Frances McDormand who is married to Joel Coen, has a brief part as film editor C.C. Calhoun, apparently for the one sight gag where she almost chokes when her scarf gets caught in the film editing machine while she is showing Mannix a film clip. He is able to rescue her by reversing the film machine.<br/><br/>The movie can be enjoyed as light entertainment in a throwback look at movie-making in the 1950s. However some have analyzed it as having much deeper themes. It isn't my favorite of the Coen brothers movies but in total it is very worthwhile."

His current main issue is that one of the studios biggest stars, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by Communist screenwriters. But its all in a day's work for Eddie Mannix.<br/><br/>Quite entertaining...in spells. It's really quite hit-and-miss. The first 30-40 minutes or so, which were mostly background, were great. There was a wonderful sense of lightness and quirkiness about the movie. <br/><br/>However, the plot development wasn't always engaging and was sometimes silly or dull. Worst of all was the main plot, the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock. It seemed implausible and silly from a point and never really got back on track.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) - Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) sub-plot was great: funny, and the casting issues around it seemed quite realistic. Some great moments in other sub-plots too.<br/><br/>At an overall level, what keeps the movie from falling apart is the boundless, infectious energy of Eddie Mannix. Josh Brolin is superb in the role.<br/><br/>The other glue is the Coen Brothers obvious love of cinema and the art of movie making. This movie is a homage to the Hollywood of the 50s and the Coen Brothers spare no effort in recapturing that era. <br/><br/>Good ending which ties the whole story together well. The takeaway message from the movie may be self-serving but it is loving and sincere."

","Witty, pretty, with some great shots, fun acting and a few laughs, but ultimately, it feels like nothing ever happens. This is the most surprising thing about the movie: despite the conspiracy, the abductions, media machinations and long-winded confessions, there's just nothing really going on. Nothing, really.<br/><br/>For someone interested just in acting it might be worth watching, to see Clooney's wonderful performance and to see all the stars switching from the high-pathos acting of the depicted era to being civil. Scarlet Johansson's cameo is an absolute treat and Josh Brolin is, as expected, magnificent. <br/><br/>But for a casual viewer: the movie has essentially no plot, no character development... well, again, there's nothing going on.

","The film ""Hail Caesar"" is an excellent example how someone can take a very thin slice and give it a full body from attention to details embodied by underacting actors and make it very interesting... ...its an extremely thin slice (best way to describe the lack of plot), a story coveted by loose threads and unresolved anecdotes, but by the means of great direction and great actors forced into underacting, they manage to pull of something which is really really interesting... there is a Fargo'sk lack of ambition which eventually turns out to reach far higher than any ambitious act attempting to depict the same or more, the Coen trademark... a flick where the after-movie experience is just as great as the in-movie experience... highly recommended ! Casting alert: Josh Brolin is incredible as the underplayed main play... Spoiler alert: Clooney and Scarlett J. basically plays themselves while Tatum only plays two parts, the drunk, tap-dancing, singing & swinging, homo-erotic Sailor and the patriotic pet- loving Russian Spy... not sure if that says more about Tatum, the Coen bros or Clooney & Johansson... Second spoiler alert: The unfitting musical intermezzo featuring Tatum is actually well choreographed and should deserve a mention of its own... very odd episode, which really seems to have no point, its absolute disconnect from the rest of the story is provocative... perhaps a dozy period in the post-production or perhaps a stroke of pure psychological genius by the Coen bros as it comes at a time in the storyline which actually calls for relief... I guess only a F2F with the Coen fellas would help to clarify if this truly is a stroke of genius or just good luck... The Coen bros are proving their continuous ability to not only adopt Jarmusch's and Lynch's ability to cater for details, but also to entertain like a Hitchcock or Welles !"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","17 May 2016"," The Coens are still sharp and smart, but 'Hail, Caesar!' isn't quite engaging enough
","In tackling Hollywood's Golden Age, the Coen Brothers have made their glitziest film to date in ""Hail, Caesar!,"" but a couple musical numbers featuring Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson are just the commercial selling points of what is actually another off- beat yet deeply philosophical film from the duo.<br/><br/>As such, it's easy to see why ""Hail, Caesar!"" could be viewed as misleading when it turns out not to be the uproarious comedy suggested by the premise of a Hollywood studio fixer whose big movie star is kidnapped by a group called ""The Future."" The first clue of this marketing misdirection is the film's stark opening shot on a sculpture of Christ on the crucifix, followed by our discovery that the big Capitol Pictures epic feature film at the center of this movie is actual called ""Hail, Casear!"" with the subtitle ""A Tale of the Christ.""<br/><br/>The religious imagery makes for an interesting contrast with the film's plot. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the man who makes Capitol Pictures' problems go away. A last-minute star is needed for a high society Broadway adaptation? He ropes in Western star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) and makes it work. Johansson's DeeAnna Moran is pregnant out of wedlock? He has a plan to make the child legitimate. ""Hail, Caesar!"" star Baird Whitlock's (George Clooney) disappearance, however, calls for more desperate measures.<br/><br/>This story plays out as more of a ""week in the life"" portrait of Mannix with some diversions into these other films, like a hilarious scene in which Doyle, a southern boy lacking sophistication, works with director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) on his lines, or a musical number with sailors with not so subtle homo-erotic undertones. Yet this gives the story (and consequently the viewer) problems staying focused. The narrative thread just isn't as tight or compelling as in other Coen films. Even the ending comes as a surprise, in terms of timing, because we never get a sense of the story's arc.<br/><br/>The thematic threads, however, are as sharp and intriguing as ever. In addition the lens of faith being applied to the film from the get- go, the Coens bring in a Communist element in the form of Whitlock's captors, who criticize the old Hollywood studio hierarchy, which of course has a lot of modern-day relevance in both the movie industry and in greater society. The Coens suggest that big movie studios are a microcosm of other hierarchies (including religious ones) and highlight the complex relationship between the large entity that makes everything possible, and the talents of the individuals that it comprises.<br/><br/>That makes ""Hail, Caesar!"" another great Coen film to use in teaching a film class, but doesn't make it among their best films, at least not when you consider all the trappings (i.e. big-name stars and musical numbers) that would lead you to believe it should be among their most entertaining works. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","This film tells the story of a man in Hollywood, who keeps the studio running and the stars happy. We see twenty seven hours if his life, which are already enough to be filled with many entertaining and baffling events.<br/><br/>""Hail, Caesar"" shows many interesting events in the Hollywood film business back in the day. I find the Hobie in the ballroom scene very funny, that Hobie can talk normally outside the camera but not when the camera is rolling! The bit about Scarlett Johansson's character is funny as well. Tilda Swinton's characters are funny too. Though the events are entertaining, there is not much intensity and irony that is often in a Coen brothers film.

"raymond_chandler","8","1","2","11 April 2016"," Hail Tilda!
","I just finished watching ""Hail, Caesar"". This is a new Coen Brothers film which pays homage to the film studios in their waning days of 1950s Biblical spectacle and Western singing cowboy flicks. It follows a classic one-day pattern of starting in the morning of one day and ending about 24 hours later in the morning of the next day. Tilda Swinton steals the movie despite only appearing on-screen for about four or five minutes. She plays feuding twin sister columnists, based on the rivalry between Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. TS is phenomenal, creating two completely individual characters using voice inflection, facial tics, posture, attitude, and costumes (including fabulous HATS, natch!). George Clooney does a sort-of reprise of his befuddled goofball from ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", but he is not as successful this time, IMO. Josh Brolin plays the main character, a grizzled studio 'fixer' who must deal with the disappearance of a big star in the midst of shooting the climax to the titular epic tale of Jesus Christ and a Roman soldier's conversion at The Crucifixion. Josh does a great job, capturing the rhythms of the Coens' zany dialogue and satirical tone, without going completely over-the-top. Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, and Alden Ehrenreich also do outstanding work in this loaded ensemble piece. Other notable actors appearing briefly include Clancy Brown, Fisher Stevens, Frances McDormand, Christopher Lambert, Ralph Fiennes, and Jonah Hill. I loved it, and I look forward to re-watches just for the pleasure of Tilda's acting.<br/><br/>""Hah! Would that it were so simple!"""

","I had no clue what this movie was about when going in. I was quite thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie. Had a simple concept of the main man keeping control of the Hollywood scenario back in the day. Jumped to some entertaining in studio filming with some pretty good humor mixed in. The story was straight forward with a satirical look at things. Definitely worth it if you are not the type that needs straight action and/or intriguing story to pull you through the movie. If all you need is good acting from all and a story that is entertaining and fulfilling, then this one you will enjoy. Some of the later reviews on here are hitting this movie way to hard as they must have been expecting an epic or something."
"Suppiluliomas","8","1","2","30 March 2016"," A refreshing look at Hollywood's studio business in the 50s
","One of the first scenes shows a man sitting in a car watching a house in the distance, rain is falling, a voice from the off says something about the time 5 a.m. and how this is sleeping time for most people but for some it is working hours... With this tribute to the film noir such as ""The Naked City"" (1948) the mood is set. And so it went on with tributes to pictures and movie genres. Epic films like ""Ben Hur"", Esther Williams with synchronised swimmers, Western movies, dancing sailors that have Gene Kelly written all over it. It has it all. Someone had already made a reference to Woody Allens ""Radio Days"". I agree. This has a similar feeling. The Coen Brothers, however, look at it in a satirical, not to say critical way and show the square and bourgeois way of life in the 50s. Illegitimate pregnancy or homosexuality are fatal for a career in the studios, and there is of course a reference to the McCarthy era. It is a great joke, though, that the screenplay writers who had kidnapped the movie star (Clooney) are indeed upright communists. And Clooney, typically cast as the idiot in a Coen picture, ends up studying Marx' ""Kapital"" with his kidnappers. The comedy in ""Hail, Cesar!"" is rather subtle, and the actual story is not at all complex and quickly told. Instead there are scenes, such as the aforementioned dancing sailors, that don't drive the plot forward at all. Maybe that's a reason for the mixed reviews. It didn't bother me. I enjoyed ""Hail, Cesar!"". A lot."
"Rickting","8","1","2","26 March 2016"," A highly entertaining and sadly panned comedy from the Coen brothers
","A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s tries to recover a leading star after a kidnapping. Of course, this is the Coen brothers so things won't be that straight-forward. Sadly, audiences seem to have responded really badly to this. The main reaction seems to have been what Ralph Fiennes and Alden Ehrenreich say repeatedly in one of the film's most hilarious scenes (And the scene which formed the basis for my favourite trailer of any 2016 film): ""Would that it were so simple?"". Hail, Caesar! is a complicated movie which goes in many unexpected directions and most of the actors featured prominently in the trailers only have cameos. Admittedly, HC is a somewhat incoherent movie and there are moments where the pace slackens. But it's still a genuinely good movie. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is very pleasing without being overly flashy and the script is full of clever humour and wonderful Hollywood homages. Like always with the Coen brothers it's never superficial and there's plenty of hidden depth beneath the surface here. It's a very enjoyable, light-hearted and fun movie which I enjoyed and everyone who I went to see it with enjoyed it as well. It may not be your sort of thing, but if you know what you're getting and if the film's admittedly self-indulgent nature doesn't bother you too much you're in for a fun time.<br/><br/>8/10"
"troyputland","8","1","2","23 March 2016"," Hail the Coen Brothers!
","The weird and hugely wonderful Coen Brothers strike again with a movie that's as odd as it is dry. The movie focuses around film studio 'fixer' Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). Any complication the studio has, he will suppress. Many burdens need tackling on this particular day; a star on their latest blockbuster goes, twin reporters working for different papers harass him, an insufferable actor who lacks talent, and an actress lacking romance. Brolin crosses the tees and dots the eyes, linking all the other film's participants into one erratic comedy. The dialogue flourishes, the farce entertains and the production's a blast to the past, with a few hidden easter eggs to boot."
"paulibrasco","8","1","2","14 March 2016"," If you like Burn After Reading, You Will Love Hail Caesar
","First I should point out my bias. ""Hail, Caesar,"" seemed like it was made for me. I love the Golden Age of Hollywood, I love the music, the cast is great, the directors are among my favorite, and I like when movies don't take themselves too seriously. <br/><br/>Because of this, I absolutely loved Hail, Caesar. It seems complicated while watching it - I begin asking questions like, ""What is this even about?"" - but after some reflection I realized the simplicity behind the film. It simply follows a Production Manager offered an easier job and he must choose between the stress of the business he is good at and the safety of a business he doesn't feel drawn to. It is an incredibly simple concept, and about 15 minutes of the film are actually dedicated to that struggle. The rest of the film simply illustrates how complicated, stressful, and whacky the industry was back then. <br/><br/>I truly think creating such a large film out of the smallest struggle is brilliant. The Coen Brothers don't take too much time on plot or seriousness, but for some reason, by the end, the emotional arc and protagonists' decision was much more powerful than in more serious films they have written (Bridge of Spies). <br/><br/>There are some breakout performances and jokes that many might consider stupid, but I am still floored by the beauty of how simple it was. I wish I can give a more detailed review - but sadly I haven't yet been able to comprehend what makes the Coen Brothers' madness and stupidity so brilliant and powerful. <br/><br/>This is the type of film I can watch again and again. It has the makings of a cult classic - but it probably won't reach that point."
"Irishchatter","8","1","2","12 March 2016"," Really good!
","It does tell you a lot of what Hollywood did back then, like regards with covering up famous people's personal mistakes. It does tell how Hollywood is corrupt like always, you'd think that every little mistake was such a big deal and just throw it away because it's not important. Well let me tell you, it made things feel very awkward and closeted for the stars involved. I know movies back then were all lovely but, it would've been better just to stand up for who you are as a person good or bad! <br/><br/>Anyways I'm babbling on like I do in my usual reviews! I really liked the movie! Channing Tatum wasn't that bad of a singer actually and as usual, he was always a great dancer! At least this is something different for him as he normally does hip hop dancing but it's nice to do another type of dance for a change! I was really shocked actually that he was a Soviet army dude all along, I honestly wouldn't have thought of him as anything but a Communist throughout!<br/><br/>George Clooney was absolutely brilliant, he really knows how to play a pretty chilled out guy. Yknow when he was kidnapped by the Communists, I really thought they were gonna kill him because his character was like this 'huge' star but thankfully, no one died in this film so happy out! I was surprised to know that this film is the only movie to not have people dead. Possibly the Coen brothers wanted everyone to live this time so that's why this movie was straight forward to watch. <br/><br/>It's a rather odd movie but I was glad to have chosen to watch this in the cinema with my mother.

"dfle3","7","1","2","6 March 2016"," If you grew up watching films from this era, you might enjoy it...
","The story is set in the 1950s, at a film studio where Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin) is a 'fixer'...if a problem arises in the making of a movie (be it with actors or whathaveyou), he'll 'fix' it. That could include things like getting an actor out of a difficult situation off the set, or...something more dramatic, as we sell when this film unfolds. Expecting to see George Clooney in this movie, for a moment I wondered if Eddie Mannix was being played by him...all old guys look alike, maybe?<br/><br/>As I child, I'd remember seeing movies on the ABC (Australia) about cowboys and million dollar mermaids etc, so if you were growing up when those kinds of movies were being made and you went to the cinema to see them, you might get a lot out of the characters in this movie which play the knock-off versions of the real actors from that bygone era. For instance, I'd say that the character of DeeAnna Moran (played by Scarlett Johansson) is intended to be interpreted as being Esther Williams, who starred in ""Million dollar mermaid"" (about the Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman). ""Million dollar mermaid"" no doubt had some choreographed dance routines done in the water which were created (I would learn in a documentary many years later) by Busby Berkeley...and you get to see that recreated in this movie...or reinterpreted, as I'm no expert on this subject.<br/><br/>Since this movie is billed as a comedy, I have to say I did get a few laughs out of it. E.g. there's a funny scene early on in the movie where Mannix is holding a meeting with various religious leaders of different faiths and denominations about a movie his studio is making (""Hail, Caesar!"") and it's funny seeing how these leaders react to the premise of the movie. Actually, there's a line in the end credits of this movie which relates to this scene.<br/><br/>Also making me laugh was a scene between Wraith Fiennes (as Laurence Laurentz) and Alden Ehrenreich (as Hobie Doyle). Presumably Hobie is meant to be Gene Autrey (I'm not sure because I don't think that I've ever seen an Autry movie). Tongue-in-cheek, the scene is about electrocution. <br/><br/>By the by, speaking of knock-off characters, I'd say that Channing Tatum (as Burt Gurney) is meant to be Gene Kelly. The dance routine with Burt Gurney reminded me of a sketch on ""The late show"" featuring Mick Molloy...demonstrating how anachronistic such fare is in the modern world (this clip might even be on You Tube).<br/><br/>Since this was the era of senator Joe McCarthy, I have to say that I do find it a pity that the film's treatment of this era seems, if not fanciful, then at least insubstantial.<br/><br/>My initial notes for this film gave it a score of 75% but a few days after seeing it now, I'll just dimish my score a tad...if I had of put ""75%"" in the header of this review, my practise is to round down my scores, not up, so the net effect is the same...this film gets 7 stars from me."

The Hollywood system at the time would go to any lengths to protect their stars, and the hypocrisy within that system is laid bare in this movie. There are references to the Hollywood 10, characters who have similarities to Esther Williams, Loretta Young, Gene Kelly and Hedda Hopper; and even the film Ben Hur (the title of the movie refers to a film they are making called 'Hail Caesar – A Tale of the Christ'!). There is an hilarious scene where Channing Tatum (playing a Gene Kelly character) and a chorus of sailors sing and dance to a musical number about missing their 'dames', despite the fact the men are joyously camping it up and dancing with their male companions.

As the film progressed however it's plot splurged in several tangents and became about more characters then the brain can fathom. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed seeing Channing Tatum's music number, it's nice to see he isn't boxing himself into rom com roles, with the addition of a Tarantino film on his resume last year I feel like he's starting to diversify as an actor.<br/><br/>George Clooney was as lacklustre as ever, with all the acting capability of a dry plum.

I couldn't believe the repeated use of the old sword joke, and the scene at the foot of the cross. Was there anything that wasn't as old as the hills? It was the Coen brothers so the stars queued up for their brief appearances, maybe because they were so stereotypical the demands made on their skill were minimal.

"CineMuseFilms","7","1","3","16 March 2016"," This is an hilarious take on 'the Hollywood dream'.
","It is easy to take Hail, Caesar! (2016) as just a thoroughly enjoyable lightweight comedy. But there is much more to this film if you understand the dark history of the Hollywood studio system of the 1920s – 1960s and its demise after a USA Supreme Court found that it breached competition law. The phrase 'genre factory' alludes to that era when big production companies owned permanent movie lots, actors, sets, distribution networks and even cinemas. In common use 'genre factory' is the opposite of 'art-house' and Hollywood has always been sensitive about its reputation for mass- produced formulaic movies while independent art-houses are credited for innovative aesthetic works. Read in this context, Hail, Caesar! steps back for a huge laugh at the studio system and its legacy.<br/><br/>The storyline is based on a day in the life of a Hollywood executive, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) as he moves between scenes of various movies in production. Juggling several films at once, his job is to make sure that the big-name stars are happy and their public image remains wholesome. A staunch Catholic, he struggles with guilt over his promise to quit smoking and goes to confession every day. Across its sprawling film lots, we see scenes from a western, a period drama, a sailor dance/musical, a synchronised swimming spectacle, and the 'big' biblical epic Hail, Caesar! Things go awry when the epic's star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by a madcap group of disaffected scriptwriters and communists, a side-story that lampoons the Cold War communist peril depicted more seriously in Trumbo (2015). While sorting out the missing Whitlock, he also deals with the embarrassing pregnancy of his unmarried aquatic star whose swimming costume no longer fits; wards off irritating twin-sister gossip columnists who threaten scandal scoops; and mentors a hapless trick-riding Western star who must learn to speak in a drama film. It's a mashup style of pastiche comedy that both celebrates and mocks Hollywood genres and movie icons.<br/><br/>This is an hilarious take on 'the Hollywood dream'. The camera overhead and behind-the-scene shots on different sets is the Coen Brothers' way of self-reflectively reminding audiences of Hollywood's unbroken power to fabricate the illusions that are the very essence of the movie industry. Honest fixer Mannix symoblises the manic faith in schmaltzy escapism, the opiate for the masses, produced abundantly in the citadel of capitalism and so loved around the world."
"PyroSikTh","7","1","3","8 March 2016"," An Enjoyable Mess
","The main plot of the movie reads as a day-in-the-life story of Eddie Mannix, head producer of Capitol Studios, as he has to deal with kidnapped actors, potential PR disasters, and unhappy arrangements. However the plot gets muddled when it decides to make a big deal of every sub- plot. Of course the biggest and most peculiar is the abduction of Baird Whitlock by a group of communist screenwriters. It holds the most meat of the movie, and yet doesn't feature into the day-in-the-life approach of Eddie Mannix. He's just simply not that bothered by it; ""Give him a day, he'll turn up"" Instead his side of the movie is padded out with the other sub-plots. Hobie Doyle is plucked from his lineless Westerns and assigned to a dialogue-driven period drama, DeeAnna Moran is dealing with a husband-less pregnancy that would look bad for the movie and the studio, and Thora and Thessaly Thacker compete for the latest exclusive in movie gossip. Mannix is the guy who ties these all together as he attempts to resolve them all (finding that, in the end, they all kind of solve themselves anyway).<br/><br/>As with all of the Coen's movies, Hail, Caesar! does attempt some deeper meaning, although again like all of the Coen's movies, what exactly it's trying to say is buried deep beneath the bizarre and humorous story. It's most obvious angle, and also the principle supply of laughs, is the satire of the movie industry, particularly that of the 50s. It's riddled with movies-within- movies that riff on iconic stereotypes of Hollywood at that time; Westerns with silent protagonists, musicals with tap-dance scenes, religious epics with bombastic speeches, et al.<br/><br/>Below that though is another theme, but if I'm honest, I'm not exactly set on what specifically the theme focuses on. On one hand it's about belief, as Eddie Mannix truly believes in the movies he's making, and that they matter, that the Thacker twins' audience will believe every bit of gossip they type up, Baird Whitlock succumbing to communist beliefs without too much of a struggle etc. On the other hand, this could all be seen as a riff on loyalty and authority; Mannix being loyal to his movies, his directors, his actors etc, Thacker twins being loyal to their audience in supplying them the gossip they desire, Hobie's loyalty to Mannix in tracking down the whereabouts of Baird etc. In truth it all comes off as unfocused. It definitely wants to say something, but the approach it takes muddles up the message on the way out.<br/><br/>Comedy-wise, Hail, Caesar! isn't the Coen's funniest, but it doesn't completely flunk either. There were a number of jokes throughout the film that I did chuckle at, most notably the discussion amongst four religious figureheads is not only the film's high point, but also it's most amusing. They were so few and far between though that I can barely remember most of them, which isn't exactly promising.<br/><br/>Acting was on top form from everyone. Josh Brolin's Mannix is a hard edge who's perpetually worried about doing the right thing and making the right choice. George Clooney's Whitlock is respectable and devoted to his job, but largely clueless to the real world around him. Alden Ehrenreich (who I found out today is the exact same age as me; born on the exact same day) was also pretty great as Hobie, who looks like a fish out of water on an indoors set, unable to speak his lines, and yet with a well-established idea of his place in the industry, doing as he's told, but smart enough to take his own initiative as well. Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Alison Pill, Clancy Brown, Wayne Knight, and Michael Gambon all make appearances of varying degrees, but none of which extensive enough to make any marked impression.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is unsurprisingly beautiful watch. Hail, Caesar? Hail, Roger Deakins more like. There isn't really a lot I can say as Deakins' cinematography has yet to disappoint. He always makes the imagery in any movie he touches pop and stick in your mind's eye. In Hail, Caesar! he uses the subtle theme of movie vs reality and plays it up by making sure all the movie within a movie scenes don't look out of place, even when they have a cinema screen or camera viewfinder border. There's a couple of ""real world"" scenes that are produced as if they're part of a movie within the movie as well which cements the visual goal of blurring reality.<br/><br/>As I said, the Coen brothers either make great movies or awful movies; movies that are tight and focused and know exactly what they want to be, or movies that meander around pointlessly with nothing particularly important to say. Hail, Caesar! falls in the latter category. It lacks focus, it's never quite sure what it wants to be or what it wants to say, and it's large cast and number of sub-plots just muddies the whole narrative, ensuring that no sub-plot and no character really gets the attention they deserve. It's not a complete Coenflunk though. It looks and sounds great, and it's revision of 50s Hollywood tropes and clichés is spot on. When it does take the time to be funny, it garners a few hearty laughs, and the running jokes are sublimely subtle in their delivery. With all that considered, I give Hail, Caesar! an enjoyable 7/10. It won't rock your world, but there are worse ways to waste an hour and a half."

","Joel and Ethan Coen, have they don't it again?<br/><br/>No, I don't think so.<br/><br/>Going back to their earlier efforts Raising Arizona, Millers Crossing, Fargo and The Big Lebowski the brothers had an ability to create weird and interesting characters who carried the narrative as well as beguiling us with their idiosyncrasies. These films were like jumping on a roller-coaster and riding it through the loops,the twists and the turns. Hail Caesar is more like walking through side- show alley and stopping to look at the carnival freaks; each of them interesting on their own but non related to the last and the only thing they have in common is they're in the same circus.<br/><br/>The central character Eddie Mannix is an interesting guy. Played by Josh Brolin he has a fascinating job and you get the feeling he really loves films, the people and the industry. But wouldn't everyone love his job? He's not acting a role, writing a script, directing the talent or producing a picture? His job is to make sure all those elements work together and sort out the problems which could prevent the completion of the productions. This includes maintaining the pure reputations of the female stars, convincing directors they should continue with miscast actors and rescuing his biggest star from a group of communist writers. Just your average day for a god-fearing father of two in Los Angeles 1951.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is the best thing in the film. He's supported by George Clooney in over-acting mode doing his best homage to 1950's Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster dressed as a Roman Centurion. His kidnapping is supposed to be the main story but it feels like an excuse for Brolin to move from studio to studio allowing us to witness an Esther Williams-esque aquatic piece with Scarlett Johannson in the starring role, a Sailor-themed dance number with the excellent Channing Tatum clearly inspired by the great Gene Kelly or a black & white socialite vehicle directed by Ralph Fiennes doing his best Noel Coward impersonation.<br/><br/>I left the cinema asking myself whether the Coens created Hail Caesar as a thank you to all the producers who helped make their pictures? These thankless yet well-rewarded individuals very rarely get the recognition they crave. Other than that I don't get the purpose of the film unless it's to poke fun at the black-banned writers of the McCarthy era or just so the Coen boys could create a swimming pool scene, a singing cowboy piece, a black & white high society drama, a sword & sandal epic or a dance number without going to the trouble of making five separate movies?<br/><br/>Hail Caesar is not a return to form for the Coens in fact it may not make their top ten but it is an interesting walk behind the scenes of the Hollywood studio system of the 1950's."

","There are two things I'm not fond of in movies...nay loathe. One: Tap dancing. Sure I appreciate the art and time it takes to learn this craft, but it has no place in movies. Two: Synchronised Swimming. Again this is a very athletic sport, but bores me to death on the big screen. Hail, Caesar! the latest exploit from the Cohen Brothers has both. So we are not off to a good start and not just snippets, but entire scenes filled with this dross. I get this movie is set in the past when the Hollywood Star system was in place and it pays tribute to the Gene Kelly's and Esther Williams of this world. Josh Brolin plays Hollywood fixer and studio boss for Capitol Pictures in 1950's America dealing with the rise of Communism after World War 2 plus shutting down or creating rumours about his stars sexuality or indiscretions. This is meant to be a comedy, but I could count the laughs on one hand. Tilda Swinton as gossip twins is just corny. Why does George Clooney continually sign up for the Brothers movies? He is a modern day Cary Grant given the right script, instead he comes off as an idiot. This is one of those all star movie projects where the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. Two stars namely Brolin and Clooney were wasted on this film. The only thing abducted in this picture was my ticket price. This is no Burn After Reading, Blood Simple, No Country For Old Men, Big Lebowski or Fargo. Grossly disappointing."

"abouhelier-r","7","1","3","19 February 2016"," Hail, Caesar!
","A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s works to keep the studio's stars in line.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! lines between drama and comedy get blurred, but so do the lines of what makes a good story. Coen Brothers celebrate the movies of this era and have some good-natured fun at the expense of the system that produced them. This film is full of real world specific references ranging across nearly 15 years, beginning with Capitol Pictures based openly on MGM in the 1940/50s. There's a lot of variety in the Coen's formula and an extremely wide range of tones. But all of their stories eventually come down to the question of whether the protagonists have any sort of personal moral compass, whether they follow it, and how the world punishes them if they stray from it. In a blind viewing, the average cinephile could probably identify this film as a Coen Brothers picture, because of their signature: serious people taking ridiculous situation gravely, straight-faced film references, several distractingly famous people taking on cameo-levels roles and George Clooney playing a dummy. The main theme is a man following his code, but also, the craziness of man, the nature of faith and the terror of trying to figure out what path through life is the correct one to take.<br/><br/>This film showcases the greatest cast the Coens have ever assembled. Josh Brolin character is a fast, decisive thinker who doesn't examine his choices once he's made them; though he was really good, funny and likable as Eddie Mannix. Plus, a great performance comes from the 26-year-old Alden Ehrenreich, astonishingly good at playing a bad actor and surprisingly selfless. This film deals more directly with existential questions than most best-known feature films about filmmaking; about the frustrations of the business, most of them feature characters touching on the questions ""Why do I do this? Is it really possible to make art under these conditions? Am I selling out? Should I get out of this business while I can?"". While divided on these questions and the industry in-jokes are nearly always funny, this film is unabashedly in love with Hollywood and regards the 1950s studio system with the utmost scepticism even as it becomes an expression of movie love at its purest.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! delights in the genuine magic of the old studio machine and it luxuriates in the details of this period. As ever it is the details that win us over. This is a very weird movie but in a good way because it's different. The cinematography by R.Dickens is beautiful. Coens Brothers craft seemingly grinds to an even sharper point of perfectionism and clarity than usual. The most sublime moments in the film occur when the behind the scenes machinery drops away, the films being produced become the film we're watching and we're invited to lose ourselves in a state of vintage Hollywood.<br/><br/>Next to these gemlike moments - which the Coens very smart editors of their work as always, refuse to linger on - the story being told here all fades into insignificance : Baird's disappearance is resolve with little tension or surprise which leaves some narrative holes: it's rather an excuse to explore 1950s Hollywood than the other way around. <br/><br/>Overall, Hail, Caesar! is a noising new testament to that old time religion known as the movies. This film is one of the Coen's most serious pictures as well as their silliest."

It's not one of the best Coen brothers film, and is somewhat confusing, but funny. The Coens are just goofing around with this one well-made movie filled with amusingly stylized performances by famous actors that make that movie worth seeing.

I'm happy to say that it was a lot of fun. <br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is a very different movie. It's not at all what you'd expect, but despite this it turned out very well. The ideas are all very funny, and while it's more fun to think about how goofy it is than actually watch it, it's still presented well enough that it stands as a great movie even without the comedy. I was happy to see that a lot of clichés in kidnapping movies like this weren't indulged in, and it really was a very unpredictable movie. <br/><br/>The characters are quite good too, surprisingly. The humor helped to show what each of them is like, and although Josh Brolin easily received the most screen time of them all, it was clear what kind of person each character was from the handful of scenes they were in, which I thought was very impressive. <br/><br/>Overall Hail, Caesar! is a great movie. While it's better remembered than watched, it stands as a great movie even while watching it. The plot is unique and well-presented, the characters are good, and the ideas are, while over the top and goofy, very well suited to the whole film. Most of them are subtle enough not to be annoying, nor are they ever overused. The movie still maintains a relatively serious tone throughout, but the subtle ideas thrown in here and there are fun, and somehow manage to actually suit the movie very well. In the end I'd certainly recommend Hail, Caesar! to pretty much anyone. It's not for everyone, so you'll just have to see it to know."

This fast and even frenetic film is a dazzling tribute to the glory days of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Set about ten years after ""Barton Fink"", ""Hail, Caeser"" follows a day in the life of Eddie Mannix (John Brolin), a Hollywood producer and studio executive whose job it is to sort out any problems that arise, which of course they do in spades. The stellar cast each represent a different obstacle to overcome by Mannix, such as an out of wedlock pregnancy, twin journalists desperate for the dirt, a hopeless casting of a lead, and the abduction of the star of the studio's biggest movie of the year. As Mannix moves from one crisis to the next, we see only snippets of these situations, each more hilarious than the last. <br/><br/>Therein lies the crux of the problem with ""Hail, Caeser"". Each piece of the puzzle begged for just a little bit more, which I suppose is better than getting sick of any one. I felt it could have been just a tad more developed and a little slower, although the speed and superficial treatment did add a lot to understanding Mannix' character. With Richard Deakins at the helm of Cinematography, 'Hail, Caeser"" is a visual masterpiece. Given that I already own every other Coen Brothers film, there is no question that ""Hail Caesar"" will find its way into my collection."

Only the Coen Bros. can pull that off flawlessly and that's exactly what 'Hail, Caesar!' does.Just like Eddie Mannix says in the film 'Hail, Caesar!' is a prestigious film that dives into old Hollywood and shows a glimpse at the curtain of Hollywood movie magic. 'Hail, Caesar!' is the best movie about Hollywood in the 1950s since Sunset Boulevard.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! stars Josh Brolin who plays Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood fixer, that has to find the biggest movie star Baird Whitlock, played by George Clooney, so he can finish filming the studio's biggest movie, 'Hail, Caesar!'. But that's not all this movies about. We have Mannix trying to figure out his life, fix a Hollywood actresses image and getting a cowboy actor to do a dramatic role. This movie is basically about everything. When I heard people saying that this movie was bad and complicated it reminded me of people's first reaction to Inherent Vice. But after seeing 'Hail, Caesar!' I can definitely say that this movie is pretty straightforward but can get weird, Coen Bros. weird. It's a really convicting screenplay with great direction from the Coens.<br/><br/>The performances are great in 'Hail, Caesar!'.This has to be the most star studded cast of 2016. We have the Coen Bros. staples like Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton but we also have Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson, Wayne Knight and newcomer Alden Ehrenreich. Ehrenreich gives the standout performance as Hobie Doyle. His character is an actor who's mostly in westerns and is out in a dramatic role where the director finds out he can't act. It makes for one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But the real standout is Josh Brolin. This is probably Brolin's best role since No Country for Old Men. His character has so many subtleties that make you want to know more about this guy. He has a great scene with a Priest and a Rabbi about the depiction of Jesus in the film that was honestly the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>If I had to say any problems with 'Hail, Caesar!' it could be the ending. I personally liked the ending a lot but I could understand why some people could be turned off by it. It's a lot like other Coen Bros. movies where it ends very abruptly but they do it in a way that's almost genius. I've heard some people complain about some tone shifts but I think it was one tone throughout and it did its job spectacularly with that. It felt like the 50s and had great commentary on filmmaking back then and filmmaking now.<br/><br/>While most people will go and see a weird attempt at quirkiness from the Coen Bros. others will see the genius that is 'Hail, Caesar!' It's a hilarious look at Hollywood and the film industry that will surely entertain."

"bkrauser-81-311064","8","1","4","7 February 2016"," Classic Screwball Coen Joint Certain to Divide Audiences
","One thing is abundantly clear while walking out of Hail, Caesar!, the Coen Brothers' newest screwball comedy, it will divide audiences. Amid the throngs of people who walked away from the screen into the lobby, I couldn't help but notice many different factions all vying to make a point about the movie's quality. Some were upset at the assumed pointlessness of the entire ordeal while some were excited and even elated by what just transpired. Well at least no one left the theater quietly.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is a anarchic comedy detailing a dizzying day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Brolin) the Head of Physical Production and resident ""fixer"" for Capitol Pictures. Beginning during a brooding Los Angeles evening, Eddie goes to confession before going about his business forming, making and protecting the studio's investments i.e. the stars. It's easier said than done however, unseen Studio Head Mr. Skank, wants B-Western Star Hobie Doyle (Ehrenreich) re- branded as a romantic leading man. Meanwhile musical star DeeAnna Moran (Johansson) is pregnant and refuses to marry the father which proves a problem for the studio's squeaky-clean image. Finally there's Capitol Picture's greatest marquee star Baird Whitlock (Clooney), an oaf with a history of Hollywood shenanigans who is ransomed by a cabal of disgruntled Communist writers.<br/><br/>These are the basic premises of the plot but just like most other Coen Brothers' movies, the setups are simply there to highlight the inanity, eccentricities and sincerity of the characters. The screwiness of said characters bring to mind the ensemble cast of Burn After Reading (2008) only the story has the quixotic ambling of The Big Lebowski (1998) and the amiable goofiness of Raising Arizona (1987). Josh Brolin has never done a better job, playing the gruff but likable Mannix. Even when he's tempted to jump ship and work for Lockheed his affection for his work, his co-workers and his family all seem genuine. His likability is rivaled only by Alden Ehrenreich's performance as an honest working man turned cornball tobacci-spitter. Beneath his fish-out-of-water boyishness lies a shrewdness that helps tie the film in a nice little semi-conclusion.<br/><br/>If one were to find a comparable Coen Brothers movie to Hail, Caesar! it wouldn't be any of the ones I just listed. I would argue Hail, Caesar! has the same religious undertones to A Serious Man (2009) as evidenced by the continuous religious iconography and symbolism. Mannix, much like Michael Stuhlbarg's character in A Serious Man is in the middle of an existential crisis and tries to find meaning in a never-ending escalation of problems. Difference is Mannix finds the answers he's looking for. He finds them not in the confessional, nor the easy route at Lockheed, nor in discussions of entertainment culture representing a new form of social control; he finds it at the movies.<br/><br/>There's a pivotal scene near the beginning of the film that feels like the beginning of an old joke. Mannix sits in a room with a priest, a minister, an Eastern Orthodox clergyman and a rabbi. He explains the prestige picture the studio is releasing (starring Whitlock), telling the story of Jesus through the eyes of a Roman centurion. They're asked if anything in the film is offensive to which they vehemently argue. They ultimately agree on only two things; 1. God is divine, 2. The movie is okay.<br/><br/>That pretty much sums up the Coen Brothers' view on movies which like Nationalism, Communism and yes even Religion can be used to inspire and/or control. Generally people ascribe themselves into various tribes based on common attributes or principles. We almost act like Russian nesting-dolls of identity many of us claiming to be for example; Americans first, Anglican second, Fall Out Boy fans third and so on. Mannix doesn't know if he should be a Capitalist first and a Hollyood man second ultimately deciding with repeated slaps to George Clooney's smug face. Showbiz is his tribe and he worships the stories they tell no matter how corny or over-broad or saccharine.<br/><br/>Your opinion of this film will largely be determined by how you rank movies within your own identity. For yours truly, Hail, Caesar! is further affirmation that the Coen Brothers simply cannot make a bad movie. Yet there are plenty of reasons not to like this movie if you're not a filmophile including the Coens' patented quirkiness (which there is a lot of). I suppose in this world, everyone's a critic.<br/><br/>www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

While the movie is very funny and the characters are memorable, the story can leave you scratching your head, especially in the third act. Some of the people that saw the movie with me were questioning what the whole point of the story was considering everything that happens. Hail, Caesar! is not a masterpiece but it is a very fun movie; I would put it in the same vein with O Brother, Where Art Thou? but not the same with Fargo or No Country for Old Men."

But that's pretty much all it's got going for it. First off, there's no story. None, and Clooney's being seduced by commie screenwriters is not a story. Then...what decade is this? Brolin uses a 1930s phone, the musical numbers are MGM late 1940s, and there's a singing cowboy star who would not be a star in the 1940s. THEN - the pastiche numbers.

","Hail, Caesar is a nostalgic tribute to Hollywood movie studios by the Coen brothers that follows a day in the life of famed Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix(Josh Brolin). Covering a myriad of both small and large problems from quitting smoking to saving careers from scandal Caesar is filled with wonderful set pieces, funny arch characters and incidentals but as a whole a scattered mess that doesn't deliver much of a story.<br/><br/>Mannix's day begins rousting a movie siren from career disaster as he pays off cops and cuffs her a few times for her blundering. It's then off to confession where he is racked by lying to his wife about quitting smoking. Then it's a day of keeping religious leaders content, an aquatic star's pregnancy secret and gossip columnists at bay; mulling a job offer with Lockheed and paying off a cabal of commie writers who have kidnapped studio star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney).<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar has a buoyant Hollywood Confidential look that is rich in production design and well lensed by Coen regular Roger Deakins offering up some richly nourish compositions as well as flawless Busby Ballet and On the Town.. Like the rag it offers a variety of stories with characters that come across more as caricatures than real and it dilutes both tension and interest as Mannix moves from one fire to the next while attempting to avoid nicotine along the way.<br/><br/>Brolin's brooding Mannix is spot on but his simmering intensity begs for a meatier plot with higher stakes. Ralph Fiennes and Scarlet Johannes are both broad and hilarious while Francis McDormand in a brief cameo as a film editor nearly steals the film in under two minutes as does Alan Ehrenreich in a lengthier piece as amiable singing cowboy Hobie Doyle. Did I also mention Tilda Swinton playing twin gossip columnists doing the same? Even with the surfeit of entertaining performances the story scatters and it is left up to fans and historians to drain a semblance of interest from the veiled and blatant references to Ester Williams, Tyrone Power, John Wayne, Carmen Miranda, Loretta Young, George Cukor, Clark Gable while using using Paramount and Warner Studios as backdrops to the fictitious Capital Pictures in the film.<br/><br/>With its sleek and colorful mid 20th century look, a half dozen fun performances and some outstanding choreography on land and water Hail, Caesar is filled with entertaining moments but is more a three ring circus than a cohesive story telling and it ultimately disappoints."

It's got its moments, sure, and there's nothing wrong with it on the technical, artistic or acting end of things, but... the plot is just... uncommitted? I said shortly after seeing it that I felt like it couldn't decide between having a main plot and being an ensemble comedy, so it winds up not really committing to either. It's got a main plot, but the film seemingly only remembers to address it every 20 minutes or so. There are also a few subplots, but few of them ever go anywhere. And then there's the padding. So.

It is probably the funniest of all the Coen brothers' films, with unbelievably great comedic performances by Brolin, Clooney, Johansson, Fiennes, Tatum, Swinton, McDormand, Hill and literally all the rest of the cast. There is not a bad performance in this movie. In fact, it is worth seeing just for the cameos. It is also one of the most cinematically gorgeous films ever shot, with amazing recreations (send-ups, really) of old Hollywood production numbers.

"Rendanlovell","6","1","9","6 February 2016"," Solid comedy despite a rocky narrative.
","Hail, Caesar!' is the Coen Brothers latest comedy....satire....thing. These brothers have directed such masterpieces like, 'No Country For Old Men' and 'Fargo'. (I'll stop with these two because writing all their awesome movies out would take far to long.) With all their excellent films backing them up, it was pretty much impossible for me not to be pumped for this movie. Especially with a cast list like this, wow. And after seeing this film, my expectations have been met. Not exceeded but, simply, met. The best part of this movie is, for sure, the dialogue. The Coen Brothers have always been known for sharp, snappy banter that they can effortless form between characters. And they do a fine job of exactly that with 'Hail, Caesar!'. The conversations that form before our eyes don't just flow, they bounce. They move with just the right amount of energy to give these simple lines on a paper, some pep in their step. It's what they do best because they are the best at it.<br/><br/>Their lines can transform an eh actor into a good actor. Because they've already done half of the actors job. All to often in films today we have great actors trying to make an awful script sound okay. Not this movie. 'Hail, Caesar!' has great actors and great dialogue. But the reason that it's so good is because it builds on itself. Each character genuinely feels like they are talking to each other as people. Using back and forth to construct a natural conversation. <br/><br/>It sounds so simple but, for some odd reason, this has become all to rare in cinema today. And since the dialogue evolves in a natural way, the humor lands ninety percent of the time. Because it feels genuine. The humor in the movie never comes across limp or bored because it feels like the people in the movie actually mean it. Yes, I know we are only a month into 2016 right now but this will most likely stand as one of my favorite comedies of the year.<br/><br/>All this is well and good, but a movie would be nothing without a story. While, the story it has is certainly unique, it really isn't that good. Like, at all. Here I would normally point out one or two particular problems with the story but I can't. I can't because everything about the story is bad. The pacing is uneven, the twists make no sense, and (to top everything off) the movie runs for about thirty minutes too long.<br/><br/>Mainly thanks to A LOT of unnecessary fat. The film is obviously trying to be a clever satire of the film making business and it is, but it does way to much trying to be just that. It leaves in scenes that feel like they should've been saved and released with the DVD as deleted scenes. Each time one of these scenes crops up the films comes to an uncomfortable halt. Although, it's often difficult to notice these scenes because of how hilarious they end up being.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers film knowledge and consistent entertainment continues to impress me. Yet, much like a few of their other works, 'Hail, Caesar!' suffers from an unfocused and, frankly, quite a bland story. It's poorly paced and sometimes extremely stale. That being said, this is a fun film. The cast seems to be enjoying themselves quite a bit, having been given a great script to work with. That helps to make this a pretty enjoyable ride although very flawed ride."

To me, this film was love letter to Hollywood that seemed to forget to have an actual story around the various odes to classic cinema that surrounds it. There are some attempted funny moments, and the film sure is gorges to look at, as one would expect from something put together from Roger Deakins. It does for sure make itself highly respectful to that golden age Hollywood scene, capturing all the magic and the wonder that was in cinema at that time, and I always enjoy peeking behind the curtian to see the inner makings. We also have a large cast of good actors attempting to make it all work.<br/><br/>Where this film falls flat is all down to the writing. Basically, there is no story to this movie, at least, not a very good or memorable one, it does not get above the flash, it always loses flair. There are attempts to make commentary on the red threat which was big in Hollywood at that time, but they really do nothing with it, and all the odes feel quite forced and shoved in.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","5","0","1","8 March 2019"," Working more as a history lesson in film than a straight-up comedy.
","I like movies as much as the next connoisseur of film, but clearly the Coen Brothers like them more than I do. Specifically, they like the films made during the ""golden age"" of Hollywood: the 1950's. From action-packed westerns, to Biblical epics, to underwater choreography, to big-budget musicals, these films exemplified a Hollywood that was on top of its game. Unfortunately, as is the case with any great success, it can be hard to maintain over time. In what could be considered a ""love letter"" to a Hollywood of the past, the Coen Brothers bring all these films together in Hail, Caesar! (2016).<br/><br/>While I could appreciate the references made throughout this film, many of them felt quite disjointed. Sure, there's the tie-in to real-life Hollywood fixer, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), but he merely acts as a link between scenes of grandeur meant to show how well the Coen Brothers can follow the homages of the famous films they're parodying. In fact, some of these segments are almost uncomfortably long, with little point other than to show off a well-known genre or style (or to beat a joke to death). As a result, the pacing of this film feels quite staggered and the plot on the light side.<br/><br/>Admittedly, Hail, Caesar! is fun, with some good bits interspersed throughout. The ""red scare"" starting to gain relevance in the timeframe leads to quite a bit of comedy, the meeting to ensure nobody is ""offended"" is hilarious, and even some of the film segments are amusing as well. We do get to Channing Tatum's singing and dancing skills on full display in this film, but it's hardly enough to save it from itself. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated what the Coen Brothers were trying to do here (and it wasn't necessarily to poke fun at Ben-Hur (1959)), but it never felt coherent enough to be good.<br/><br/>Working more as a history lesson in film than a straight-up comedy, I give Hail, Caesar! 2.5 stars out of 5."

"SimonJack","4","0","2","27 April 2018"," Just a little piece of Hollywood under the magnifying glass
","""Hail Caesar"" is billed as a comedy and mystery, but is mostly a satire of Hollywood. It has very little humor in the dialog, and unless one knows history, much of the plot may not make sense. That includes American history of the mid-20th century, and knowledge about Hollywood in the first half of the last century. With some knowledge in those areas, one can follow the plot and appreciate the humor in the exaggerated scenarios. An example of the latter is when some of the Hollywood communist cell take a small boat to deliver an agent and the ransom money to a Soviet submarine that surfaces off the coast of California. <br/><br/>The film covers some of the culture of Hollywood at mid-20th century. But also omits mention of much of it that became known over time. Hollywood had many a scandal over drugs, crime and sex. In the main character, Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), the film tends to idolize the studio head. It puts Mannix on a pedestal for his 18-hour workdays, seven days a week, in which he holds the studio together. So, all of what Mannix does is whitewashed as essential to protect the stars, the studios, etc. <br/><br/>One interesting inclusion is Tilda Swinton who plays sisters Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker. They are supposed to be Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, who were not real sisters. They were the famous Hollywood gossip columnists since the early 1930s. The little stories that Mannix has to play them to print or not print pale compared to the real stuff that the two rival columnists produced, publicized, promoted or buried. <br/><br/>Other things about Hollywood of the time are barely mentioned or not at all. The assaults and murders, suicides and mysterious deaths, adulterous affairs, alcoholism and drug use, car accidents and many other real troubles that actors got into and that Hollywood tried to covere up. There's no mention here of the sex exploits of some studio heads with young actresses that could determine their careers. Enough real news and exposes have come out of Hollywood since before the mid-20th century, to conclude that Hollywood was a sordid sector of society. <br/><br/>So, that's a list of some of the usual goings-on in and around Hollywood at least into the mid-20th century. This film skips or skims over much of that, but not all. It does have a pregnancy out of wedlock that is covered up, with a twist so that it doesn't look exactly like a couple of real instances. <br/><br/>Instead, the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, take aim at the mid-20h century. And specifically, the time of the communist scares and type of film output from Hollywood then. It's somewhat of a social agenda about Hollywood kowtowing to the politics of the day. This is where some knowledge of history helps one follow the script. <br/><br/>The House Un-American Activities Committee was investigating the influence of Communism in the entertainment field. The period was often labeled the McCarthy era, after Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy who said that communists infiltrated the U.S. State Department in numbers, and were gaining control throughout government. McCarthy had phony lists and in the end could produce very few names in support of his claims.<br/><br/>But, public concern was fanned when real Soviet spies were caught or uncovered and Soviet individuals began defecting. This was happening in the U.S. England, Canada and other Western countries. A 1948 movie, ""The Iron Curtain"" is the story of a Soviet code worker in the U.S.S.R. embassy in Canada who defected. He provided information that uncovered an extensive Soviet espionage network in Canada and the U.S. It had been stealing American atomic secrets since the end of World War II. In 1953, the U.S. executed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for their spy activities for the Soviet Union. As with most events in history, some people thought the Rosenbergs were innocent or had been railroaded. But much evidence was uncovered in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union that detailed the great amount of espionage they had done for the U.S.S.R. 
 
This time also was at the height of the Cold War when tensions between the Soviet Union and the West were near fever pitch. At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union controlled Eastern Europe. So most of those countries were under communist rule and weren't free until after the 1990 collapse of the U.S.S.R. The nuclear arms race was on between the Soviets and the U.S. Those who lived during that time well remember the air raid drills in the schools. By 1962, the U.S. and Russia would be near a nuclear war when Pres. John Kennedy ordered a naval roadblock to stock the Soviets from installing nuclear missiles in Cuba aimed at the U.S. <br/><br/>I can't imagine that people without much knowledge of history would find this entertaining or be able to make much sense of it. As one who remembers the political history, I found ""Hail, Caesar"" just somewhat interesting. It was a recap of some bits of Hollywood history. But, it gosed over the real scandals The plot with the studio magnate, Mannix, seemed somewhat contrived. Yet, one could see it was needed to connect the rest of the parts of the film. With very little humor, this movie soon becomes tiring. That's not a very good recommendation for any movie.<br/><br/>The funniest line in the film was by Hobie Doyle, the Western star, played by Alden Ehrenreich. Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) asks him, ""How did you get into pictures, Hobie?"" He replies, ""Got roped into it."""

Interspersed are satires of the era's great flamboyant excesses (including an Ester Williams style water-ballet, a Gene Kelly style song and dance routine, and an over-the-top singing-cowboy Western). These 'films-within-film"" are (IMO) the best part of ""Hail, Caesar"", although I found the thin 'plot' tying it all together to be entertaining as well.

No laughs, but some decent scenes by the musicals and overall chemistry of the cast. Hail, Caesar may be considered one of the Coen Brothers more disappointing films as this film had much hype surrounding it leading up to its release, especially considering the cast. <br/><br/>Though the highlight of the film is the character of relatively new comer and future star Alden Ehrenreich. The leads of Josh Brolin and George Clooney play their typical act. Scarlett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill don't have as much screen time as their names were advertised.

One take is that this film tries too hard at being funny and different that it misses the mark, and the overall plot of the film and setting isn't too engaging."

There were a few interesting/chuckle-worthy moments like when an actor would give a beautiful speech then forget a line; the sense of deflation and annoyance around the set would be palpable. But, IDK, the directors jumped in hip-deep too quickly and Josh Brolin was acting at 100 MPH before viewers even had a chance to get settled in.<br/><br/>The Coen's revisited some of their old motifs (voice-over narration, George Clooney acting clueless, etc.), but none of it worked this time, IMO.<br/><br/>And, the whole Communist subplot was pointless.

"brando647","8","0","3","25 March 2017"," HAIL, CAESAR! is One of the Funniest Movies of 2016
","The Coen brothers bring us back to the golden age of the Hollywood studio system with their 2016 comedy HAIL, CAESAR! On the scale of Coen comedies, I find this one is more entertaining than BURN AFTER READING but never reaches the heights of their (in my opinion) best, THE BIG LEBOWSKI. It's an easy watch with a relatively simple story that relies a bit on the viewer having either nostalgia for 1950s era Hollywood movies or an appreciation for the studio system of decades ago. I fall into the latter category, loving this frenetic voyage back to the 1950s where we're to tag along with studio head Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) to witness a day in his life as he juggles problem after problem. Mannix is an honorable man with boundless loyalty to the studio but the stress has taken its toll on him. As the film begins, he receives an order from the men above him to move famed musical cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) to the studio's latest period drama, much to the classical director's extreme dismay. Meanwhile the studio's star synchronized swimmer DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) has become pregnant out of wedlock, which could become a PR disaster, and the lead actor (George Clooney) from the studio's biblical epic, the titular HAIL, CAESAR!, has gone missing. Mannix races to solve these problems while fending off twin Hollywood reporters (Tilda Swinton in a dual role) eager to break a story that might damage the studio's delicate reputation.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be indescribably fun. It's got a manic pacing that races you through from start to finish and encourages further viewings to catch jokes you might've missed the first time. It's a bright, colorful adventure through the eyes of the over-worked Mannix who moves from issue to issue without missing a beat. It's full of fast-talkers and oddball characters. If I were to complain about anything, it would be that there's so many interesting scenarios playing out over the course of the movie that we didn't get enough time to thoroughly dig in. The Hobie Doyle issue, where a simple cowpoke finds himself tossed into the stiffest of dramas with an auteur director (played by Ralph Fiennes) who is equally panicked at having to somehow teach his new star how to show some class, has some of the funniest moments in the movie but it's relegated to a secondary plot. I could watch an entire movie on that situation alone. Give Ehrenreich and Fiennes a spin off film documenting the making of that movie-within-a-movie. The primary plot thread, obviously, is the abduction of the studio's biggest star Baird Whitlock from the set of HAIL, CAESAR! Clooney can play aloof with the best of them and he's got a comedic timing that isn't put on display nearly often enough. His Whitlock awakens from his abduction in a gorgeous seaside home surrounded by strange men and, not only rolls with it, he comes to believe in their mysterious cause.<br/><br/>Much of the film's fun comes from the madcap journey behind the scenes of the movie studio system of the 50s. Mannix's business takes him behind the scenes of a massive synchronized swimming sequence (a relic of decades past) and, more interestingly, a Hollywood musical. We get an entire song and dance sequence featuring Channing Tatum as the star of an old Navy musical where he and a team of sailors lament their future lack of dames on the high seas to an upbeat tune. I thought it was interesting to see what sort of stuff went into the choreography and camera blocking. It's fun. Everything about this movie is a blast and it's a shame to see it didn't receive a whole lot of love from audiences. I guess you need to have at least a passing interest in the subject matter to find the entertainment here, otherwise it must come across as a lot of fast-talking gibberish laid over a scatter-brained plot that can't seem to find its focus. I wholeheartedly disagree, as I've found HAIL, CAESAR! to be massively re-watchable and I've yet to find myself bored with it. It has a contagious positive vibe in this love letter to a Golden Age of film. Coen fans should find plenty to appreciate here and I hope more casual fans or less-informed mainstream audiences will give the film a chance and find something to enjoy as well, whether it be the performances, the production, or the sense of humor."

","The Coen brothers are geniuses and they once again show it in ""Hail Caesar"". The movie suffers as the directors use it as a mean to an end. What exists is a collage of scenes, with little holding them together and a script that lacks a plot in the classical sense or even a story arc. The brothers use satire and comedy to pass some highly controversial ""images"", avoiding, with the appearance of humor, the censorship all media and entertainment goes through today. Using the lack of intelligence, awareness and critical thinking of the perpetually offended, and of course some very skillful writing, the Coen brothers are able to present us with a brutal and savage portrayal of ""golden age"" Hollywood. Inspired in real events and persons, the filth, moral degradation and political decadence is all gloriously exposed. Particularly shocking and most worthy of compliment is the fearless assertion of the communists' use of film to introduce their political views in the entertainment of the unsuspecting masses. This is perhaps the first time I have seen such a claim in a Hollywood movie, at least told so boldly and explicitly. McCarthyism has long been vilified and the communists whitewashed by history and countless stories of injustices and broken lives produced, of course, by Hollywood. In hollywoodland no one was ever a communist and all were always falsely accused. In the movies, no communist in the ""business"" ever dreamed of using the power of the pictures to indoctrinate. Its obviously a myth. McCarthy had a base of truth and was needed in a time where a war of culture was being waged. Traitors undercover, scheming and sabotaging, could not have been allowed and had to perish. The absolute ridicule of the communists is staggering. Kidnappers! Ransoms! The Coen brothers are madmen! Also worthy of note is how Mannix and Hobie Doyle are the only two moral characters in the movie. Mannix is drowning in a sea of corruption and degeneracy, cleaning up the mess everyone else does, to keep the movie stars as a pure object of adoration for the audience. In the end he does it, not for the studio or for the stars themselves. He does it as a moral obligation, because its what's right. He's a family man, something the screenwriters of today loathe. He is also a devout catholic, another thing loathed by cultural Marxists. Hobie Doyle is a ""good old boy"", happy in his western movies. He's naive, eager to do the right thing as well. He's pure and basically happy to be alive. The Coen put him against one of Hollywood's directors, a suave, cultured man. The clash of the ""redneck"" and the intellectual is one the most amusing scenes and the Coen once again are savages. The director is arrogant, pretentious and superior. He complains that Hobie cannot act. He dismisses his good will and eagerness to learn. Later we find out he is an homosexual with a history of trading roles for sexual favors. Another Hollywood tradition. Another stab under the guise of humor. And so it is. One of the most brave movies in the last years. Its all there. And they never saw it coming.

","In spite of what many naysayers have written here, this is not the Coens least successful film at the box-office (which is the also misunderstood Hudsucker Proxy). It is a different type of film, and thank heavens for the Coens' courage to keep trying new things. A subtle look at philosophy through the lens of a second-rate 50s movie studio, this is actually 5 or 6 movies in one (depending on how you count them), and although humorous at times, it is not a comedy. If a strict, linear action plot is your forte, skip this film.

"oOoBarracuda","10","0","3","27 February 2017"," Hail, Caesar!
","Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) works for the fictitious studio hybrid Capitol Pictures, (that is the only fictitious angle about this film, however). Mannix is a fixer, the one responsible for repairing the issues of his acting stars, keeping the religious leaders happy with the morals of the films of his studio's, and securing the money stays in the right places for film production. Mannix leads a busy life, but he is sure to make time for his daily stop to his Catholic Church's confessional. Despite the Priest's urging that his practice is excessive, Mannix still shows up, desperate to make amends for his transgressions, also to work through his own issues with his faith. During a typical day of dealing with pregnant single movie stars, placating religious leaders, and casting dilemmas, Mannix is dealt an extreme blow that his biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped. Those responsible for the stars kidnapping, who refer to themselves as ""The Future"" promise the safe return of the studio's star in exchange for $100,000. Not only does Mannix have to scrounge up the funds to pay off the ransom, but he has to do it while keeping the situation out of the gossip columns running Hollywood public opinion. All of Mannix's problems may be solved, however, if he accepts a surprise offer in management at the Lockheed Corporation overseeing secret atomic bomb testing. Does Mannix really want to leave behind his chaotic role at the studio, or is such the profession exactly what he needs for the self-discovery he so seeks.<br/><br/>The first and most obvious point to be made about the film is that it looks incredible. The use of color and the cinematography are works of art, leaping off the screen. It is no wonder the film was nominated for Best Production design, as the many large and elaborate sets were astonishing. Filming several movie sets is no small task. but the team behind Hail, Caesar! really pulled it off. Near the opening of the film, Brolin's character is discussing the depiction of Jesus in one of the studio's upcoming films with Priests, a Rabbi, and an Imam Khatib (maybe); this scene could come directly out of a joke, but it is complete perfection and timely in the film. It was a brilliant scene exposing, without a doubt, the faith-based journey the audience was about to take. What was an especially fun aspect of the film were the obvious caricatures of actors, directors, and producers from the studio era. As a fan of classic film, seeing such personalities as Ernst Lubitsch exaggerated on-screen was a true delight. There were also several notable supporting stars in the film it was a joy to see who would turn up next. Ever since I first saw Patrick Fischler in Mulholland Dr. I've wanted to see him in everything and was overjoyed that he briefly showed up in Hail, Caesar!. Typical of the Coen Brother's films, there was some brilliant camera angles to enjoy including wonderful low-angle, birds-eye-view shots and perfect shadow manipulation creating a beautiful film to look at. One of my favorite aspects of Hail, Caesar! was the frequency with which the audience gets to see the film from a perspective usually ignored. The camera is typically trained on the star of the film, but seeing the POV of an extra looking up at Baird Whitlock and all of his imperfections was a nice change. Whether it be a picture, a film, or anything else, I am always interested in what's going on in the background; what is it that is not being shown for a litany of reasons, and with Hail, Caesar! It is that background activity that gets such high regard, a refreshing angle for a film.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of a Coen brothers film is the subtext. Even if I am not always a fan of the duo's work, the fact that each of their films are riddled with subtext create, at least, an engaging film-watching experience. The takeaway from Hail, Caesar!, for me anyway is its subtext on faith and religion. It's clear that the character embodied by Josh Brolin is grappling with his faith throughout the film. He takes time out of his schedule daily to go to confession, he deals with the religious depiction in his studio's films seriously and even has a God-like job himself. Brolin's Mannix is responsible for removing problems and making sure everyone's life is as painless as possible all the while controlling the flow of money and output of his studio. People turn to him when experiencing problems, much like they turn to Christ to help cope. In the end, Mannix is offered a job to help protect the lives of the whole world, furthering his relation to an omnipresent being. Evaluating faith and religion in such a way was a serious strength to Hail, Caesar!. A deeper evaluation of faith and religion should be explored through cinema, as it is the medium with which art is nearly limitless. The Coen brothers, never to shy away from depth in their films, strike gold again with a thorough analysis of faith, and what it means to adhere to a religion. If you examine Hail, Caesar! on its own, rather than an entry in the filmography of the Coen brothers, a deeper appreciation may be able to be experienced for a wonderful film with a rich, much-needed subtext."

","A great movie.<br/><br/>Within this medium of feature films, almost every year we see many satires, parodies, that use references of other works or situations to build their, always around, jokes about such work.<br/><br/>In this, we almost always see productions that may even be funny, but in 99% of cases they are just that, with no other ""layer"" behind everything, and ""Hail, Caesar!"" Is not one of those cases!<br/><br/>The story of the film basically shows ""one day behind the scenes of a studio,"" with a parody of various elements of the film industry, from the life of a producer, decisions made within a studio, and how they can influence the future of production , And etc, always with an intelligent humor, that at the same time makes fun of the situation, showing them in an exaggerated way, also makes a criticism.<br/><br/>Stuffed with great actors, the performances of the film dispense with comments, with impeccable direction at that point, and a script, which, as I said above, is intelligent and very well written.<br/><br/>In summary: ""Hail, Caesar!"" It's a great movie. Smart and funny.

"rmax304823","7","0","1","22 February 2017"," Life At The Top.
","In its subdued way this is a hilarious movie.<br/><br/>Brolin is the manager of a movie studio in the post-war years who must keep things rolling. He's a devout Catholic. His last confession was 27 minutes ago Brolin likes his current job despite the tension but he's been offered a higher-paying position. He hesitatingly asks the priest during confession about the conundrum. Should he keep his current job, which he feels is ""right"", or take the newly offered one? The priest thinks for a moment and replies, ""God always wants us to do what's right, my son. You see, God has given us this inner light --"" ""Yeah, yeah, I got it,"" says Brolin and bolts impatiently out of the confessional.<br/><br/>The narrative has Brolin making a movie called ""Hail Caesar"" starring Clooney. But Cloony is drugged, kidnapped, and brainwashed by a handful of egghead communists, including one mastermind with an absurd foreign accent.<br/><br/>It works. Clooney is released. He returns to the studio and explains dialectical materialism to Brolin in his office. Brolin fumes. When Clooney says something like, ""It's all a game by the vested interests to deprive us of our dignity,"" the scowling manager says, ""It is, huh?"", barely able to stifle his fury, and finally leaps around the desk and slaps Clooney out of it. The actor meekly obeys.<br/><br/>I won't go on about the plot. It's filled with the Coens' usual irony. At the end, Clooney gives a truly transformative speech as the foot of the cross. The entire crew is enthralled by his passion. Then he forgets the last word of the speech and ruins the shot.<br/><br/>It's scored by Carter Burwell whom I admire for his compositional talent and his sense of humor. Brolin's main conflict has been between religion and a coarser conformity. And under the end credits -- while the theater is emptying -- Burwell plays a beautiful rendition of a traditional Russian song, along the lines of ""Kalinka,"" performed by the superlative Red Army Chorus. When they're finished, we hear what sounds like a hymnal from Mitteleuropa. In between there are discreet peeps of a sonar apparatus, presumably looking for an ideological submarine, and when everything else is finished there is the cry of a distant siren."

A great many known actors also appear, in more or less (especially Dolph Lundgren) prominent roles. <br/><br/>Feels a bit like the Coen Brothers and friends had a get together to reminisce about good old times.

","George Clooney isn't an actor I rate particularly high, but, when he puts his mind to it, he really can act. His great performance in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was one example. And here we have another.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the 1950s when, of course, the US was in the grip of McCarthyism. Clooney plays Baird Whitlock, an empty headed star of epic films. He is kidnapped by radicals who demand a ransom of $100,000. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the studio heavy who has to sort this out, while handling pretty boy cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who has been cast (OK, miscast) in a costume drama, fending off gossip columnists, considering a lucrative job offer, dealing with a pregnant starlet, and so on. On top of all that he's trying to quit smoking.<br/><br/>I wonder whether it's easier for actors to play actors playing a part than it is to just play the part. The performances are, in fact, a real strength of this movie. Clooney is engagingly irritating and Brolin turns in a surprisingly sympathetic performance for such a heavy character. I also liked Tilda Swinton in a dual role as two sisters who are rival gossip columnists!<br/><br/>The film captures the magic of 50s movies rather well. Scenes from the various movies being made as the story progresses are shown, including a rousing song & dance number called ""No Dames"" featuring Channing Tatum. When Whitlock is able to return to work, we get a scene that is set at the Crucifixion and gives Whitlock a chance to deliver a monologue that carries real power – until he forgets his lines!<br/><br/>The music is excellent too. <br/><br/>So, all in all, a pleasant, undemanding film experience.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10."
"ElMaruecan82","6","0","3","7 February 2017"," Oy, Caesar...
","""Hail, Caesar!"" was one of the most anticipated movies of 2016 and one of the earliest releases. Being the last Coen brothers' movie made it an event by itself and probably one of the first expected Oscar contenders. Well, are you surprised that it only got a (lousy) Production Design nomination? I am not. Because... let's not kid ourselves; we all know the movie that marked the beginning of 2016 was ""Deadpool"". Sure it is less artsy and subtle than the more gourmet offering of the Coens but the film had the merit to feature a consistent plot, hilarious gags and without trying to be too smart, showcased a level of hip wit and self-deriding fun that ""Heal Seizure!"" failed to deliver. And I'm the first to deplore it.<br/><br/>I know these two movies are as close one another as Meryl Streep to a Michael Bay's script, but they have one thing in common that justify the comparison, they're meant to be fun and they rely on parody. The parody is the key because it works on a material we're all familiar with but then distorts it in order to produce gags based on unpredictability. The trick is to not to rely too much on the spoofed material because not every audience would get the references or because the film serves the references, not the opposite. I'm more familiar with Hollywood history than comic-books heroes, yet I enjoyed ""Deadpool"" more than ""Give'em Hell, Caesar!"", I know it has everything a movie lover should love, it is a love letter to Hollywood, not without that ounce of wicked wit the Coen brothers made a specialty of. This is a film I wanted to embrace with my arms wide open, I love the brothers' movies and a film about Hollywood is the kind of offer I couldn't refuse. But this is 2016, we had ""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Chicago"" and ""The Artist"", then ""Argo"" and ""Birdman"", movies about old-school Hollywood have flourished like cactus in the desert. I even started to reconsider my love for these films because of the way they started a tiresome trend but again, this is a Coens' movie so it's always new even by the standards they create. I saw the film once, I had to see it twice, and then even a third time.<br/><br/>Indeed, if it came from any other director, I would have thrown it already in the trashcan of my contempt but the Coens always get the benefit of the doubt. So how does ""Hell or High Caesar!"" hold up after the third viewing? Well, maybe better than at the first but that's not saying much. The premise is simply brilliant, having a Hollywood office worker whose specialty is to fix things (he's not called a fixer for nothing), and played by the always convincing Josh Brolin made me feel like I was going to penetrate an atmospheric neo-noir masterpiece like ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Then the movie cuts to the titular film-within-the-film, a Tale of the Christ where George Clooney, playing a washed-up version of Robert Taylor in ""Quo Vadis"", is kidnapped.<br/><br/>But by the time we get the identity of the kidnappers, and their political inclinations, the film features a collection of old-school Hollywood pastiches with an Esther-Williams actress played by Scarlett Johannsen in a Ziegfeld Follies act, a Western B-movie actor who's probably a reference to... some B-movie actor and a few other musical numbers. To get things straight, they're all well done, but they don't add anything to the plot except for just being well done, they drag on for so long I suspected they were used as time fillers. Some parts were hilarious though, I loved the scene with Fiennes as a Polish director or where Eddie Mannix talk with the religious representatives and they go into a debate about God. God, that was pure Coen brothers' genius.<br/><br/>But despite the obvious effort to cover all the elements that made the history of Hollywood in the 50's, the Hayes codes, stars' depraved lifestyles, the Red Scare, ""Excelsior"" might be just a tad too sophisticated for its own good. It is probably an intelligent movie in its stylish complexity but it commits a rather silly move by predicting our instant praise on the simple basis that it's about movies. Well, the stunt seemed to have worked with critics as the film but it didn't show with the audience and many viewers dismissed it as the worst Coen brothers' film. Would I? Well, forgetting the premise and some hilarious parts, it is probably the worst in the sense that it simply used Hollywood as a vehicle for gags, but they never made you feel you that it was going somewhere, ""meh"" was my most frequently obtained reaction.<br/><br/>I felt some strong Woody Allen vibes from it, from the stellar cast (also including Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill or Tilda Swinton as the two gossip columnists, twin sisters embodying the Hedda Hopper/ Louella Parsons rivalry) the film might have worked better had it played like Woody Allen's masterpiece ""Radio Days"". The film could have been a ""Hollywood Days"" with many little vignettes and that would have forced the Coens to push the concept a little higher, to make each one as enjoyable and entertaining as the whole of the film. Or maybe they should have just tried to forget about the whole homage thing because the film was never as funny as when it took departure from its Hollywood shtick.<br/><br/>Now, to end on a positive note, if you love Hollywood and appreciate a good love letter with all the archetypes that forged Hollywood legend, just watch the magnificent five-minute dream sequence of ""The Ballad of the Daltons"". As for this film, well you might give Caesar what is Caesar's, but there's not much to give."

Every cast member is complex enough in their performance that they exceed in both dramatic and comedic moments, which includes Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>Its biggest weakness is its lack of a plot, it has one, very small story that does not consistently move forward, instead there is simply one sequence after another of films being made. Joel and Etan Coen clearly fell in love with the idea of recreating 1950s Hollywood that they forgot to tell a story that has a proper beginning, middle and end. <br/><br/>It is also not very funny. I find the Coen brothers very hit and miss with comedy, I favour them using it subtly in their dramas. Full sequences that were clearly made with the objective of making us laugh did nothing for me, it became tiresome for me after a certain period of time as a result of how often the humour bombed. <br/><br/>It is certainly a beautiful spectacle, even if there's not much more to it beyond that.

The action sequences such as the horse-riding, synchronized swimming, dance scenes are good enough to be in the old movies. They were really good and took talent to perform in their own right. That is what makes them funny...right as you are about to fall in love with the scene it falls apart in a twisted, funny, nuanced way. <br/><br/>Burt Gurney...almost sounds like Bert and Ernie...(Channing Tatum) as a dancing communist was so weird that it couldn't be anything but a farce.

","Personally I never always really knew what to do with the Coen Brother's movies, like ""A Serious Man"" for example... The directing is always flawless but the story is colorful to say the least... I decided to buy this DVD because of my current passion for Julius Caesar, the Coen Brothers doing a movie with this subject I had a hunch it would be great... The movie is like two days in the life of fictional character Eddie Mannix, who is boorish and kind of a ""problem solver"" for the studio... The movie is a little bit like ""Pulp Fiction"" in the structure, it's a lot of small independent stories and the link between all of them is the character of Eddie Mannix... For one thing the script is so clever if you're not really a subtle kind of person you're going to miss much of the dialog, it try to be cartoonesque but serious at the same time... For example one of the first scene of the movie is a dialog between manner-less Eddie Mannix and four religious authority figures regarding what is Jesus and is he God, and later we see the character of George Clooney being abducted by a group of Communists, all in the same movie... The directing is masterful, the colours, the sets, the choice of actors and the acting are all flawless and made with artistic sense... Overall it's easily a 10 out of 10, bad reviews come obviously from users who didn't understand anything to the very fast-paced dialog and story, and don't have any sense of humor, which is required to appreciate this picture..."

","We watched this one on the small screen, via Amazon, so we didn't get the full effect of the big production numbers--one of them, an Esther Williams-style ""water ballet,"" clearly descended from the bowling-Valkyrie dream sequence in ""Lebowksi."" My wife tuned out almost immediately. I found it intriguing but not very involving; the jokes are the kind that might make you say to yourself, ""That's cute"" or ""That's kind of funny,"" rather than actually LOL. ""Hail, Caesar""'s comparable to ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" IMHO, in that the main character's basically opaque and not very sympathetic, and practically everyone else is a cartoon or a grotesque of some kind. The brothers' trademark cold-eyed detachment isn't really working for them here, in other words.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Josh Brolin gets full marks for his performance as Eddie Mannix, old-school Hollywood fixer and hands-on production exec. Eddie's to-do list provides the Coens with a perfunctory plot: a starlet's caught posing for ""French postcards,"" the unmarried star of popular ""aquatic pictures"" inconveniently gets pregnant, the erratic lead in a Bible epic unexpectedly goes AWOL, the studio head casts a singing cowboy in a foofy drawing-room comedy<br/><br/>Most of the film consists of skitlike set pieces tied together, as the Dude might say, by nutty disquisitions on philosophy and religion. There are some hits here, some misses--a cell of blacklisted writers explains Marxism to a susceptible movie star (George Clooney) (hit); Eddie consults a panel of squabbling clerics to make sure the Bible epic's ""visual depiction of the Godhead"" won't offend ticket buyers (miss).<br/><br/>I didn't get the sense that the Coens were seriously trying to engage with any of these Big Ideas, as they did so brilliantly in ""A Serious Man."" I wasn't sure what to make of Eddie's obsessive Catholicism (""Father, it's been 27 hours since my last confession"") or the dimwitted actor's flirtation with Communism. The takeaway seems to be that religion and politics are all very well, but when it comes down to it, you just have to go out there, hit your mark and say your lines. (Clooney's character fluffs his big speech when he gets to the word ""faith""; make of it what you will.)<br/><br/>Despite ""Hail, Caesar""'s disappointing lack of emotional impact or intellectual heft, the Coens' reanimations of extinct Hollywood genres are still pretty entertaining; the cowboy shoot-'em-up and super-gay dance routine (""No Dames""!) might be the best of their kind since ""Blazing Saddles."" The cast is spectacular, of course; Clooney always seems right at home in a Coen bros. picture, and we expect Channing Tatum, who plays a Communist song-and-dance man, to display some serious chops; Alden Ehrenreich's ridin', ropin' and shootin' skills are no less impressive.<br/><br/>Long story short, this one's probably best suited to TCM addicts and boomers (like me) who grew up watching stuff like ""The Robe"" on TV and wondering, ""What were they thinking?!"" It's more of a Barton Fink picture, in other words, than a genuine Coen bros. movie, but it's well made and quite watchable if you scale down your expectations."

","From time to time, movies like this are made, by talented directors- producers and including talented actors.

","Jesus Christ and a scooter, sometimes one wonders how it can possibly happen, amidst so many Marvels, that a movie has the guts for a ""But far away in Palestine (Divine presence to be shot)"" card. Welcome to the Billy Wilder forties, with the brightest imbecile in the room, namely George Clooney, the royalty Hollywood does NOT deserve, playing movie star Blair Whitlock playing Caesar in some prestige Christian epic.<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious, and its comic range is so impressively broad that telling the tale would spoil the viewer's pleasure. Blair Whitlock is abducted from the sound stage and studio fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), having a crisis of faith as in any Coen movie, has to get there back on time for his Oscar moment. That will prove difficult and desperately simple in equal measures. Enough said about the plot.<br/><br/>With ""The Future"" being a recurring theme of an intrigue set in the past, the movie has a thing or two to say about the present. From an cumenical meeting featuring the various confessions the movie in production may or may not offend (""The Nazarean was not God!"" tersely states the rabbi), to rumour-mongering gossip columnists (SWINTON, larger than life and twice as funny), the Coen spotlight is merciless. Did things change that much in 70 years?<br/><br/>Wonderful comedy moments erupt from scene rehearsals, with lobotomised extras waiting their cue for the next take of Merrily We Dance, the parlour piece painstakingly shot by Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Scarlet Johansson has a deliciously vulgar turn as a pregnant Esther Williams. To one's astonishment, Channing Tatum steals the show as a sailor doing a flawless Gene Kelly routine filled with gay innuendo, singing ""We might see some octopuses"", in a bar/brothel called the Swinging Dingy, no less.<br/><br/>The nefarious plot concocted by Hollywood's communist writers (all nine of them) is based on ""accelerating the dialectics"", something of a Coen brothers' trademark. Things get hectic by way of a near-death by Moviola, a lasso demonstration and a make out scene that so far only Walt Disney's The Lady and the Tramp had managed to pull off. Lord, they even manage to sneak in a Dutch angle, which made one spit his drink.<br/><br/>Gloriously ending on the stupidest possible scene involving a Soviet submarine, a lapdog and an attaché case full of dollar bills, Hail, Caesar! is a non-stop giggling feast. Caesar finally delivers his Oscar monologue on Golgotha, but he blanks on the last word. This last word – or the lack thereof – wraps things up ideally. Bravo, bros!"

","So here's the new film from the Coen brothers. They have become rare in the recent years, I was always checking out what's next for them and now I'm slightly disappointed with this. I enjoyed watching it, it is one of those you want to rate them better, but you can't for some unidentified reasons. According to my analysis why I was not satisfied fully is the story. I mean the narration was rich, performances were phenomenal and music, locations, all were fantastic, but the screenplay was kind of aimless. The beginning, the ending or even in the mid part it had no purpose, but something like a mockumentary about the film industry of the 1950s.<br/><br/>With the average screenplay, the directors have shown their magic. Very cool presentation, you would enjoy it if you're theirs films fan. But I don't think all his fans would be pleased enough. This is truly a multi-starrer film, everybody was at their best in their retro characters. If you share your experience with others who also saw it, they might ask who do you liked the most. Probably many would favour Josh Brolin, because he had more priority than others who comes under his belt. But George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich also have given a good show followed by Scarlett Johansso and Tilda Swinton. The remaining ones as well not bad, but Jonah Hill was completely a waste.<br/><br/>Since it is about the film industry and its people, brace yourself for some good laughs. There is variety in it like different genre/theme and multiple layers in the narration. Like from moving to the western to the historical subject and then to the musical and many more. It did good at the box office against its budget, only because of the star power it has and the filmmaker's reputation came in handy. Though I hope the Coen brothers would come back strong with another product and it does not take another 3 years. It is not an award winning film, just a good entertainer, but praisable quality.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The Coen Brothers who gave us one of my favorite 90s films Fargo to a crack at Hollywood of the studio era in Hail Caesar. The film had potential for greatness, but it fails in too many places. <br/><br/>The real life character of Eddie Mannix of the real life studio of MGM is given his own studio to run, the mythical Capital Pictures. Mannix had a deserved reputation as a tough guy and a formal Catholic in the Jewish world of Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg. He was a tough guy who knew more celebrity secrets than J. Edgar Hoover. He buried many a scandal at MGM and now he heads his own studio.<br/><br/>You'll recognize the satire on a lot of familiar Hollywood faces from the 30s and 40s. George Clooney as Charlton Heston kidnapped by Communist writers and held for revolutionary ransom was way over the top and sad to say doesn't do either Heston or the blacklist any justice.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand's character of Mannix who is played by Josh Brolin is not easily recognizable. But Ida Koverman who was Louis B. Mayer's faithful scribe also kept secrets well and kept Mayer's life in order.<br/><br/>My two favorites were Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists who had the same scent for scandal as Hedda and Louella did. The second was Alden Ehrenreich as a Gene Autry type singing cowboy. The scene where Brolin puts him into a sophisticated comedy where director Ralph Fiennes is trying to teach him some acting technique is my favorite in the film. Imagine trying to remake Gene Autry into Cary Grant. <br/><br/>You'll recognize a lot of the movie immortals. Some got more justice than others. Channing Tatum is in sailor musical where he's doing a number like Gene Kelly. I'll bet Tatum worked as hard as Kelly to get it right.<br/><br/>Some old timers like me and devoted watchers of TCM will enjoy Hail Caesar. But it could have been a lot better."

","The Coen brothers have been quite successful when switching to different genres by infusing a unique narrative style and their trademark quirky humor. Going by their filmography, the movies that are most likely to succeed in terms of box office performance or connect with the audience are the ones which has either a wow or a shock factor which are sorely missing in Hail! Caeser. <br/><br/>Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a veteran in studio business who takes his work very seriously. When the star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) goes missing from the sets of 'Hail! Caesar' (which is based on crucifixion of Jesus Christ through the eyes of a Roman soldier Autolycus), Eddie has to think on his feet to fix the situation. Between a lucrative job offer from Lockheed Martin, solving issues between a star and a director, fixing a PR issue of a star actress and dodging the media regarding a certain story, Eddie is pushed to corner to bring things under control. <br/><br/>Romancing the yesteryear Hollywood has been the calling for many filmmakers in the past including the Coen Brothers (Barton Fink), probably because one can spin exotic stories based on hot-headed and impossible to handle stars, executives with iron fists, limited exposure to media etc. as the corporate culture, social media and presence of mobile phones could have watered down many potential plots if set in contemporary times. While some have fared well, others have ended in disasters. <br/><br/>To give credit to the Coen brothers - the screenplay was well structured with enough entertaining moments. Their influence probably would have played the antagonist here with many writers and directors taking a similar approach of quirky humor which eventually sets the bar higher and pushing them to redefine themselves. The cameos are not worthy, the actors seemed a little disinterested, the plot neither hurries nor sets you up for a climax when featuring a plot about an abduction of a movie story. However the ever dependable Josh Brolin and the newbie Alden Ehrenreich playing Hobie Doyle are a refreshing contrast to the rest of the movie. The period inspired communist conspiracy angles, casting couches, tantrum throwing heroines, gossip column peddlers are all used to good advantage. <br/><br/>It seems to have everything going for it but just can't quite place what's missing."

It's a plot that's not enough to hold our interest and a plot that never really allows any serious laughs in a film that should've had quite a few and while the film certainly looks lovely thanks to the to be expected great work of DOP Roger Deakin's and the newly announced young Han Solo Alden Ehrenreich shows himself to be quite the find, Hail, Caesar! just never gels into a cohesive whole and feels like an experience of the Coen Brothers parodying themselves into a corner.<br/><br/>Hugely disappointing and entirely forgettable, Hail, Caesar! marks a low point in the Coen Brothers modern day repertoire and will surely go down as one of their greatest missed opportunities when all is considered from cast, setting right through to material that should've suited their unique sensibilities.<br/><br/>Saved from the doldrums thanks to some sporadic scenes of life and colour and some neat cameos from the Coen Brothers extensive list of A-list friends, Hail, Caesar! is hopefully a rare blip on the usually stellar Coen Brothers radar.<br/><br/>2 dangerously positioned scarf's out of 5"

","This is clearly a Coen Bros film, but a very tedious one. I laughed a few times, but mostly wanted many scenes to be over. It reminded me of my experience watching ""A Simple Man"": some few inspired moments, but it doesn't add up and overall is underwhelming. <br/><br/>I understand that it is a meditation on religious worship vs cinematic celebrity, but just because a movie has a theme or symbolism doesn't mean that it is good. The narrative structure is rather poor, and some satirical scenes felt like padded extra time. I left with the impression that the Coens only had enough material for an inspired satirical short film about a 1950s biblical epic, but decided to expand it into a feature length film by making it a larger exploration of the dark side of classic Hollywood and the deification of celebrities. However, characters take center place, then drop off, re-appear into the story suddenly and without reason or narrative build up, and then the shift is back to the Clooney story, or Brolin's character.<br/><br/>Coens' checklist:<br/><br/>-a criminal plot that goes wrong: check. There's even a briefcase. -men in power sitting behind desks: repeatedly, check. -a main character gets punched/shot in the face: slapped repeatedly -morality and religious themes: check -literary and classic film references: check -a hit-man or bounty hunter: not really. Brolin's character is portrayed as a studio's version of a mob enforcer, but that's as close as it gets. -regular cast members: Mrs. Coen, Clooney, Brolin.<br/><br/>Highlights: an inspired discussion between religious leaders over the portrayal of Jesus on film. The revelation of who the kidnappers are and their agenda. An over-the-top golden-haired Jesus. Discussion of the Jonah Hill's character, a professional fake person. Discussion of needing to distrust extras. The actor playing Jesus being asked about his cast status. It (almost) ends with a good joke, in the final scene about Clooney shooting a movie (although the momentum is lost). Alden Ehrenreich's character's date with a Carmen Miranda type. A few mildly amusing other jokes. Tilda Swinton's character had its moments, but this character has been done quite a few times before.<br/><br/>Really tedious: almost every re-creation of movies being shot, and fresh cuts of the movies. They're impressively faithful, the actors appropriate, but they drag, have no pace, don't know when to end, and aren't funny. I am guessing that they were meant to be criticisms of those movies and how they were shot, to remove the glamour and holiness of 1940s/50s films, but they are shot in what appears to be a tone-deaf comedic tone. <br/><br/>Out-of-place: the sub-plot of Scarlett Johansson's character.<br/><br/>Summary: disappointing Coens. I would have preferred the shorter film."

","Hail, Ceasar! is the best movie the Coens have strung together in a long time, but despite all its star power and Hollywood setting, it's still not stellar. The Coens tend to have many more misses than hits (hint, the misses are their pompous movies) but I was genuinely delighted in watching Hail, Ceasar! for parts. It's a light comedy with a few clever moments, sets, and a plot, like Eddie Mannix's watch, that keeps tick-tick-ticking along. <br/><br/>Venerated actors Josh Brolin, Tilda Swinton, and Ralph Fiennes are all here, it's great to see Patrick Fischler still weirding it up. Even Scarlett Johansson, who is *not* a great actress, delivers a solid performance as a loud, bossy chain smoker. Maybe she's playing herself or something, but future archivists of the boring will point to this film and say, ""Here! Finally! The proof that she wasn't *just* a curvy woman with big lips!"" <br/><br/>Also present is the gross, unfunny, weird ""comedian"" Jonah Hill. He has about 90 seconds of screen time and he says about three lines. <br/><br/>Blink.<br/><br/>A standout performance is Alden Ehrenreich. I've never seen him in anything before, but it's obvious he's a great actor. I was surprised with Channing Tatum as well. I always thought of him as being a meathead, but he's not GI Joe anymore. George Clooney is also back doing what he does best: playing an idiot. It comes so naturally to him! I also like that he gets slapped in the face towards the end. I had to TiVo that one.<br/><br/>Is the film without flaw? No, no, no. Michael Gamdon (of all people) narrates the movie in intervals, like the cowboy character from The Big Lebowski. Although I love Gamdon, his entire narration was unnecessary. Showy, even. Maybe the Coens included it for the sake of rounding out their list of ""motifs"" (eg., plots revolving around stolen money, an ""unstoppable evil,"" casting the same stable of actors, pretentious narration, etc) but the narration ripped me out of the moment. I found it patronizing, even. <br/><br/>Additionally, I didn't like the entire element revolving around Jesus Christ. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Jesus-freak: I just don't like making fun of faiths. At the film's start there's a roundtable discussion with a group of Christian priests and a single rabbi. Every character at the table, apart from Brolin's character, is a cliché. Additionally, the rabbi is the only sensible one there. The priests all act like (dumb) mystics. <br/><br/>Christ's golden locks, multiple confessional scenes with bored priests, and the Crucifixion (featuring a a hapless extra strung up on the cross) are all depicted. Nothing too offensive, really, I guess... all tongue in cheek, all in good fun (I guess...) It just annoys me how Christ is the only religious figurehead that you can comfortably poke fun at nowadays. I think the Coens are showing ignorance by making fun of Christ, unfortunately."

No. The Sailor dance sequence was okay, but was too long in this non-plot movie. <br/><br/>The kidnapping leaves Whitlock with impressions that the movie capitalist system keeps the little guy down and he's on board with that. He likes what he hears This and the kidnapping itself takes care of the main plot, if it was a plot at all.

Very moving and could have been used in a legitimate Jesus Christ story. Very moving.<br/><br/>Notables that really don't add much to the movie and why they are there is a mystery because there wasn't much of a plot to get excited about: Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Robert Picardo, David Krumholtz. <br/><br/>After watching this I have to ask myself why was this movie made as it was not entertaining, had no real plot, had no funny or even clever lines. It was more like a cameo-fest with no purpose. To put it frankly we didn't care about anything in this movie. Yes, the acting was good all around, but nothing went anywhere and oh, we just didn't care. See? (3/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","From the duo filmmakers whose works span numerous genres & styles, and include some of the boldest American films released in the past few decades, it's no surprise that many were expecting Hail, Caesar to be an instant classic and although it does have all the hallmarks of a Coen brothers film, it isn't as laudable as their finest efforts.<br/><br/>The story of Hail, Caesar! takes place in the 1950s and follows Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood fixer for Capitol Studios whose job is to keep the scandalous private lives of celebrities out of the press so that their public image isn't harmed. However, when the lead star of the studio's major production is abducted, Eddie ends up dealing with a lot more than just fix.<br/><br/>Written, produced, edited & directed by Joel & Ethan Coen, Hail, Caesar! is a wonderful throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood as the movie skims through productions of historical epics, period dramas, westerns, musicals & what not while narrating its own story, which doesn't pack in enough strength to capture & hold one's attention, and fails to stimulate the senses.<br/><br/>There are a few good laughs here & there but for the most part, it isn't as amazing as its previews suggested. Only one character's arc is fully-fleshed, and as for its numerous homages & parodies, it not only includes the old classics but also many sub-par films of the bygone era. Nostalgia runs high here but the film's main premise doesn't have enough flesh on the bone.<br/><br/>However, the technical aspects are brilliantly executed. Production design team does a terrific job with the set pieces, each exquisitely carved & meticulously detailed, and also succeeds in creating an authentic 1950s film production studio ambiance. Cinematography further enhances the whole imagery with its deft use of warm colour palette, the pacing is steady while the score & songs sync nicely with the unfolding events.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Hail, Caesar! has quite an ensemble in Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & others. Brolin stays true to his fixer character and delivers a strong performance, Clooney is funny as expected, and Tatum deserves a mention for steering through that ingeniously choreographed musical number with stunning effortlessness.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Hail, Caesar! features many idiosyncrasies that one has come to expect from the Coens but the laugh-out-loud moments here are few & far in between. Neither the plot nor the characters are compelling enough and there isn't much to ponder once the credits start rolling. It does work as Coens' love letter to Classic Hollywood cinema but as a comedy & mystery, it's quite stale & stays on the same level. In a sentence, underwhelming."

"seancassidy-32550","6","0","1","30 June 2016"," What should be a BIG movie, feels small.
","This movie seems like the Coen brothers had a fun idea for a movie, some good actors on board and decided to go ahead and make it.<br/><br/>The movie lacks compelling plot points and the story seems too fast paced for it's own good. This fast paced story led to a lot of undeveloped characters. We barely get to know the main protagonist, Eddie Mannix, before a truck load of more characters are thrown our way. This is surprising looking at other Coen brothers films. For example, I felt more connected to John Goodman's character in the movie Inside Llewyn Davis and he had about 10 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>The movie is about Eddie Mannix trying to keep all of his actors in control with the main story following the kidnapping of the studio's biggest star played by George Clooney. This story, being the focal point of the movie, never really takes off and the mystery shown in the movie's trailer does not match what is shown on screen. I can't say this story takes a back seat but others seem to take it's place at points throughout the movie so it never fully peaked my interest.<br/><br/>Although there are some bad points, this is a Coen brothers movie so the elegance and magic is still there. It is thoughtfully shot like any Coen brothers movie and their style never gets lost. There are movies being shot inside movies here which seems like a difficult task for the directors. But obviously, the two handled it brilliantly and that is why I gave the movie a 6 opposed to a lower rating because I am I fan of how a movie is filmed.<br/><br/>The movie seems like a test or experiment for the two brothers. It feels like they put more effort into the shoot rather than the writing of the story and plot. I believe it is called a comedy simply because it is light hearted and no real issues are dealt with throughout the movie. The jokes aren't laugh out loud but I don't think they fall short, they are the same jokes you'll see in any Coen brothers movie, there's just more of them.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie shouldn't have had as many side stories that take the spotlight away from the main story. I think there should have been more build up to the eventual twist. I think there should have been more of the actors from the studio that we see, helping find the kidnapped actor so they could have a purpose.<br/><br/>The side stories are fine when they're told but there's very little shown, like in Inside Llewyn Davis. You have a lot of side stories in this movie that we are told all of the relevant information for and shown just enough. For example, Llewyn's unknown baby, Jean's abortion, Llewyn's dad and even the cat story that seamlessly flows in and out of the main story. <br/><br/>I think the trailer shows what the Coen brothers wanted the movie to be like, a comedy/mystery with all of the studio's stars coming together to find the studio's biggest star while the main studio executive hides the story from the press. This movie would have felt a lot more compelling with a plot more focused and a story more intimate."

","I am not really sure where to begin here. Hail, Caesar! was a movie I wanted to love, but just couldn't. The thought of not liking a Coen brothers comedy still horrifies me, but that's exactly the case here.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! stars Josh Brolin as a Hollywood fixer for a fictional movie studio in the Fifties, and it is his job to privately resolve issues between stars, directors, and the media. This idea seems to be perfect fodder for the Coens to mine, but the movie just never really seems to click into place. George Clooney portrays a buffoonish movie star who is kidnapped by Communist screenwriters. Why? The movie never really makes that clear. Then there are all of the well produced, but overly long stretches showing the various movies in production at the studio, from a biblical epic to a Gene Kelly-type song-and-dance movie. I wanted to enjoy everything this movie was doing, but I never got why we were spending so much time with characters who literally only show up for one scene and then are done. The only real saving grace for this movie is the very funny performance from Alden Ehrenreich as a simple singing cowboy movie star who helps Brolin rescue Clooney. I personally would have watched a whole movie about Ehrenreich's character and had been more satisfied.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I still think there was a great movie idea in here somewhere, but Hail, Caesar! never quite finds it, nurtures it, and brings it to the forefront.<br/><br/>I give Hail, Caesar! a 5 out of 10!"
"tomgillespie2002","6","0","1","21 June 2016"," Lower-league Coen
","When a film-maker builds up such a formidable body of work, it's all the more crushing when their next project falls somewhat flat. The Coen brothers Joel and Ethan have been churning out genre-bending masterpieces ever since 1984 with Blood Simple, and maintained a healthy independent spirit until they were eventually noticed by mainstream Hollywood with 1996's Fargo. Ever since, despite still serving up great work such as No Country for Old Men (2007) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), their filmography has been occasionally blighted by bewildering misfires such as the double-whammy of Intolerable Cruelty (2003) and The Ladykillers (2004). Sadly, they've done it again with Hail, Caesar!.<br/><br/>It's obvious that the Coens hold a keen interest in the old Hollywood system of the 1940's and 50's. They were satirising the world they view with a certain curiosity and perhaps a little disdain back in 1991 with the outstanding Barton Fink. Yet while that film portrayed a bleak, subdued world full of madness and loneliness as John Turturro's titular script-writer struggled with his work and his own demons, Hail, Caesar! is the glitzy, garish world of big-budget biblical epics and movie stars with everything to hide. Studio head Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the man to try and hold it all together, from having to shield his actors' shady pasts from pesky twin journalists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both Tilda Swinton) to handling an organisation of academic-type communists who have kidnapped his biggest star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney).<br/><br/>Working almost like a series of loosely-connected vignettes, the Coens also weave numerous sub-plots into the mix. Mannix must also deal with the issue that one of his leading ladies, DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johnansson) is unmarried but with child and can no longer fit into her mermaid costume. Singing cowboy actor Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a pretty face more accustomed to strumming the guitar and riding horseback, is thrown into a drama role at the last minute, much to the frustration of sophisticated director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). There are smaller roles also for Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand and Jonah Hill in what is an unnecessarily bulky ensemble that the Coens struggle to keep a grasp of. With no real sense of direction, Hail, Caesar! often feels like a collection of clips from separate, better movies.<br/><br/>Despite the narrative flaws, there's still plenty to savour. Those distinctly 'Coen-eque' moments are peppered throughout, with Hobie's awkward first day on set and Channing Tatum's musical tap-dance being particular standouts. Although Brolin excels and Clooney makes for a very convincing wimp, Ehrenreich is the one who steals the movie as the extremely likable dimwit who may actually be the only one paying attention. He demonstrates great comic timing and all the charm of the western idols his character is paying homage to, and he seems the perfect fit for a young Han Solo in Disney's as-yet untitled origin story. The film may have even worked better as a whole with Hobie as the lead and doing away with several side- stories. Instead, it is an unfocused splurge of good ideas rather toothlessly executed but wonderfully performed. Definitely lower- league Coen."

","""It's a swell story."" Eddie Mannix (Brolin) works for a huge Hollywood studio in the 50's and deals with all of the problems that comes up and fixes them. This day he has to deal with a unhappy director, covering up the pregnancy of a popular star and the disappearance of their lead actor in their biggest picture. Eddie jumps from fixing problem to problem while trying to decide on his own future. This is a movie that is almost review proof. The Coen brothers, for as big as they are and as famous as their movies are, are very polarizing. People either love everything they do, or avoid them. For me they are pretty hit or miss. They have done some movies I have really liked like Fargo, Big Lebowski and O, Brother Where Art Thou...but they also did Burn After Reading which I didn't like at all. This one, while it was funny and I did laugh a few times was more like Burn After Reading than the others. The dialog is witty and fast paced, but the actual plot itself seemed to really drag and I found myself wondering how much longer it will go on. Overall, this is not a bad movie at all, but will do nothing to make non Coen fans into one. If you love them you will love this movie, if not you won't. I give this a B-."

","Hail, Caesar!<br/><br/>Disgracefully, in the 1950s only white actors were cast for communist roles in Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this comedy offers some enlightenment on the cultural insensitivity of ""Redface"".<br/><br/>Employed by Capitol Pictures to protect their stars from public scandal, Mannix (Josh Brolin) faces an array of back-lot indignities, including: a pregnant starlet (Scarlett Johansson), an inept heartthrob (Alden Ehrenreich), twin sister gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton) and a leading man (George Clooney) who has been shanghaied by communists within the studio (Channing Tatum, Fisher Stevens).<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers' ambitious but aimless attempt at lampooning the low-end genre pictures of post-war Hollywood and the escalating red menace therein, Hail Caesar does have some noteworthy odes to old Hollywood. Unfortunately, they never coalesce with the larger story, which seriously lacks the siblings' eccentric brand of humor. <br/><br/>Besides, the best way to catch commie actors is to stakeout the pot of borscht at craft services. <br/><br/>Red Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

It's incredibly slow in some scenes too. This must be one of those ""intellectual"" movies that critics like, but the normal man doesn't get or enjoy (while other movies that everyone else likes, the critics hate...go figure...). I won't cast a numbered vote, since I didn't finish the movie, but I'd advise against wasting time on this one.

George Clooney has a great scene with his ""I've seen the light"" speech (in the movie within the movie) near the end.

Eddie Mannix(Josh Brolin) is the head of the production company Capitol Studios. One of his lead actor, Baird Whitlock(George Clooney) gets kidnapped by script writers who wants payback for the stories which they have not been paid for by the production company. Now to every simple plot there has to be a to and fro to keep the audience interested, but the to and fro shouldn't move away from the heart of the story. Here there is so much motion and that the movie never settles. Too many loose ends. Personally for me that was a major problem. My mind never settled. Probably, it was the intention of the directors to not let your mind settle so that we can feel the rush felt by the producer. But it didn't quite work for me.<br/><br/>No complains about the cast. Though, Channing Tatum should move his facial muscles a bit more. It was unclear what he was going for. It is nice to see Jonah Hill starring in movies with such big names in it. George Clooney plays the gullible Baird. You almost begin to sympathize with him at the end. I have always liked Josh Brolin. No complains. Other than them, Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton have extended cameos. Due to which none of their characters settle down. Alden Ehrenreich is pretty good as the person who is a cow-boy on and off screen.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is well held throughout. It clearly shows that all that glitters is not gold. We only see the final product but we always don't get to see the cogs in the wheel. The hustle and bustle makes you dizzy and that is why we love the world of cinema"

","'Hail, Caesar!' was the first movie I saw in the theatre in 2016. Being familiar with 'The Big Lebowski' by the Coen Brothers in 1998, I was expecting something similar here (nuanced characters, satire, clever dialogue, humorous undertone). I found this film to be well put together. While there is nothing particularly memorable about it, I think the heart and care was definitely in there somewhere. I found it to be a thoughtful production with the clever dialogue I expected and humour, however there was nothing very interesting in the way of nuanced characters or challenging plot. I understood the overarching theme as a lighthearted ode to one of the ""golden ages"" of Hollywood, but I didn't walk out of the theatre with much memory of it. It had a mild flavor that lasts very briefly. Sort of like an avocado. Perhaps that was the purpose though."

","Despite its weighty themes, Hail Caesar! ends up as a film that is more style than substance. The Coens tear into proponents of ideologies like Communism and Capitalism. Christianity is also not spared. But ultimately, the Hollywood studio system, for better or worse is portrayed as a necessary keeper who moulds the character of flimsy and air-headed stars. The 1952 film The Bad and the Beautiful had a similar message. George Clooney, Josh Brolin and even some of the other actors act out their parts with a forced glee that is all too evident. None of them really made an impression on me. The film is more of a paean than a rebuke to 1950s Hollywood films and the men who kept everything in line. I wonder whether George Clooney's gullible superstar character was a dig at some of the politically outspoken Hollywood actors of today. The film can be enjoyed for the visuals alone, which are nothing short of spectacular. There are some great thread's on the IMDb message board which provide great explanations to the hidden meanings of some of the scenes.<br/><br/>(6/10)"
"CANpatbuck3664","4","0","2","24 April 2016"," A Good Idea Screwed Up By A Messy and Disjointed Plot
","Looking at Hail Caesar objectively, that's a hell of a cast the Coen Brothers have put together. The cast of Hail Caesar includes: Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Scarlett Johannson, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes with many other actors not even listed. It's understandable though, I'd have to imagine the Coen brothers are among the few directors that if they call, no matter what you pick up the phone and say yes. It was the cast that made me want to watch Hail Caesar, along with some curiosity about the movie being set in the yesteryear of Hollywood (the 1950s). It looked like it could be fun and I went in wanting to enjoy it. After watching it, I'll admit that I don't think I was the target market for this movie but I can only review it from my perspective.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We start off the movie with our protagonist Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) at a confessional, talking to the priest about his sins. Eddie's sins are minor though, lying about quitting smoking to his wife. The priest seems to be genuinely tired of talking to him. Eddie leaves and goes to a house where a young actress for the studio (Capitol Pictures) has been taking indecent photos. He gets the girl out of there, telling her to pretend she was drugged if asked and is able to evade excessive questioning by the police. Eddie is a fixer, he's the guy the studio puts in charge of making things run smoothly. So whether he's dealing with the kidnapping of a major star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), helping famous actress DeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) deal with an unwanted pregnancy or encouraging young western star Hobart Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who is trying to fit into a high society comedy directed by Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), he's always got a full schedule. His job can be so stressful and hectic that while all this is going on, he's pondering a job offer from Lockheed Corp. which would lead to much more stable employment.<br/><br/>The plot summary was hard to write because there really is so much going on with this movie. In fact, my biggest problem with Hail Caesar is that there are many subplots and many small characters that are interesting but I found the plot didn't fit together at all. The movie bounces from scene to scene without connecting to what happened previously. Certain characters have nothing to do with the how the story progresses (Jonah Hill and Scarlett Johansson) and they keep cutting to certain subplots where nothing would happen (We keep seeing Baird Whitlock when he gets kidnapped for 30-60 second bits where almost no progress is made for a good 1/4 of the movie). It was frustrating and confusing to watch. It left me wondering if it was intentionally made to be disjointed or if in the editing process, so much was cut out it just seemed that way.<br/><br/>The other thing that was disappointing about Hail Caesar is that for a comedy, I didn't find it very funny. Again, I'd like to say that I understand that the movie is set in a different cinematic era and that I'm sure it was full of in-jokes and references to that time. Those went over my head and while that's technically my problem, I really wonder how many other people will understand them as well. There were funny scenes (Channing Tatum's dance number was funny and impressive and I thought Alden Ehrenreich was good as Hobart) but calling this a hilarious comedy isn't accurate. I was wondering throughout Hail Caesar who is this movie was made for? It looks great and with the big cast of stars, there had to have been some put into it. But I think with this type of humour, only a small niche of the movie going public will get it. I did laugh at times but most of the movie I was just thinking about how there was too much going on and questioning how they were possibly going to tie it all together in the end (which in my opinion they really didn't).<br/><br/>There were things I liked it Hail Caesar too though. I've already said above how the movie looked great. The creative team seemed to be really romanticizing how movies were made in that time and it was easy to get swept up in that. I thought the acting was largely good too. Brolin was decent as Mannix, Clooney was really hamming it up (he always does in the Coen brother's movies) and I thought Alden was the bright spot. I also liked Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum and Ralph Fiennes. Just be careful if you're looking to watch Hail Caesar for one actor or actress specifically. The screen time that each actor gets varies greatly and while this is an ensemble, certain people vanish quickly (Jonah Hill is in it for 5 minutes tops).<br/><br/>With that gigantic cast and some really solid filmmakers at the helm there was a lot of potential here. I just couldn't get over how messy the plot was and how boring I found it to be at points. I think it's just best to chalk it up to being outside the demographic Hail Caesar was meant for. I think it would have made a better drama about how Eddie had to deal with the darker side of Hollywood and how Eddie couldn't cope with the stress of his job. But maybe that's just me, I hope this movie finds it's audience no matter how small it may be."

The Coen's have a fun story to tell, but it doesn't translate on-screen as this big-fat tribute to the Golden-Age of Hollywood. The Characters are amusing, so are some of the dialogue, but beyond a point, the narrative just doesn't hold. The Coen's Screenplay is surely underwhelming this time around. Even their Direction, though passion driven, isn't remotely among their best. <br/><br/>'Hail, Caesar!' has a tremendous cast & they all seem deliver. Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix, the protagonist, is reliably solid, delivering an arresting performance as the Fixer. George Clooney has never been this funny. He doesn't have a lot of scenes, but whenever he does get on-screen, he puts on goofiness with flourish. Alden Ehrenreich is an actor to watch. He's fantastic! Among the many cameos, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & Christopher Lambert are truly terrific. Wayne Knight is first-rate. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Hail, Caesar!' is a missed opportunity. But we all know the Coen's. They'll be back in no time."

George Clooney is spot on of a actor thinking to high of himself. Ralph Fiennes is...what is the word.... admirable of his ""lock-in"" to the segments and dialogue. So.... in other words... splendid! - The story : Movies in the movie... to create a movie... and then a sudden kidnap. Interesting! Typical Coen brothers. - Entertainment : Some really good moments. - Age : Depends on how the human being is. Suppose it could be from 11 and up.<br/><br/>6,8 out of 10.

"JohnWelles","7","0","1","31 March 2016"," The Coens, '50s Style.
","""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016), directed by the Academy-award winning Coen Brothers, is a light-hearted portrayal of nineteen-fifties Hollywood, where large film studios are all powerful. In amongst the barbs and repartee, the Coens' clearly feel an affinity with the era, and along with their cinematographer Roger Deakins, recreate the visual look of the decade with an uncanny precision. It's the first film in years to recall the Technicolor brightness of American pictures of that time; it reveals a real affection, while still maintaining a clear-eyed sense of the iniquities of the then-studio system. Studio executives control their stars' lives to the smallest degree, while waspish gossip columnists try to discover any scandal.<br/><br/>The Coens add into this mix a number of pastiches, not just of Roman and Biblical epics, but of Westerns and musicals, with a spot-on musical number featuring Channing Tatum as a sailor (in clear reference to ""On the Town"", 1949), one of the film's highlights. Being at heart a screwball comedy means the Coens' darker impulses are kept in check so that even the malevolent group the Future, who abduct George Clooney, are seen as charmingly misguided.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin displays fine comic skill and brings a layer of nuance to his serially perturbed studio boss character, while the ensemble cast match the all-star extravaganzas so popular in the nineteen-fifties: everyone seems to appear, from Tilda Swinton to Scarlet Johansson, Jonah Hill to a very memorable Aldren Ehrenreich as a singing cowboy.<br/><br/>Perhaps one criticism that could be made is that it never becomes more than the sum of its parts: the script, by the Coens, offers a wonderful whirlwind of episodes, jumping from Ralph Fiennes' refined director offering Ehrenreich elocution lessons to a distraught Brolin trying to hide the fact his biggest star is missing. Yet it never quite coheres into an organic whole and by the time it concludes, you're left feeling that it is a rather slight, shaggy-dog story: a lot of fun and frequently amusing, but not one of the Coens' masterworks, a minor work by major auteurs.<br/><br/>However, it would be churlish to deny the film's many pleasures, from Carter Burwell's score to the production design by Jess Gonchor, with costumes from Mary Zophres. It's authentically nineteen-fifties and that alone is reason enough to see it; combined with witty performances and deft direction, it almost doesn't matter that the film is about very little. Enjoy the ride and forget about the destination."

","""Your enjoyment of the film solely depends on your sense of humor, expectations, and background knowledge of Hollywood films of this era"", framptonhollis wrote in another review. How true. I saw this movie in a Dutch theatre full of people not understanding what this was all about. Only a few laughed out loud at what I think were the right moments. Many saw a stupid story and left confused, some even angry about what they'd seen or rather not seen. My wife loves fifties flicks. I love film history, careful staging, fifties detectives, cameo appearances, references to movie and political history. All of that is in this film.<br/><br/>Now do a little thought experiment. Think of an independent production evaluating the value of film making. Glue the 'lockheed' scenes are together. Sure, producing atomic bombs is a more regular job than this 'circus' but there is not much 'good' in that. In the end, we find at the confession film making has a lot of good to offer. <br/><br/>Now project this this critical evaluation in in a lovingly restored, incredibly well-executed showy absurd fifties setting. Does it now all make sense to you, grumblers? Hope so. Because then you can smile all through this film as I did. Escaping from reality for a fine 1,5 hours. And that's exactly what it's made for."
"alindsay-al","5","0","2","23 March 2016"," A average satirical film
","The cast of this film is what drew me to see hail Caesar and now I have seen it this film is very disappointing. The premise of the film sees a film producer trying to locate his top actor who has been kidnapped. Josh brolin plays Eddie mannix the producer and he is great in the film. He was the main character and had the main attention which allowed him to really add depth to his character that this film lacked otherwise. George clooney was good in this film and did the best he could with what he was given as the snooty actor. I also liked the kid who played Hobie Doyle and thought he was a pretty fun character. However, the problem is that there are too many characters that are pointless and waisted especially because of the actors. Scarlett Johansson, Jonah hill, Channing Tatum and Ralph Fiennes are all wasted and underutilised. The story has absolutely no depth to it, unfortunately there are allot of side plots that really don't matter in this film that bog it down. The script has a few funny moments and some well done drama but overall it fails to hit the levels that should be expected from all these talented people. The style is extravagant and over the top and for the most part it does work but most of the over the top parts are pointless and don't add anything to the story or characters. Overall this is a pretty average film that is not really worth a watch."

","If you 1) actually remember Hollywood movies during the late forties/early fifties or 2) are such a movie buff that you have read extensively about the period and/or have watched dozens of the movies churned out in that time period via TV, film clubs, DVD etc, then chances are you will watch this with a warm glow of faux nostalgia. If, on the other hand you're a member of the Academic-pseud axis and feel that movies are obligated to be 'meaningful' 'trope' filled, 'teachable', etc then you will be doomed to disappointment. Perhaps a major problem is that the Coens themselves are not quite old enough to remember the period at first hand and are thus attempting to replicate a period using secondary source material for building blocks. Like early Woody Allen this is a film of 'moments' rather than a cohesive offering but in my case enough of them worked to give me pleasure."
"DavidLindahl","5","0","1","22 March 2016"," Communism or capitalism?
","The Coen brothers, the directors responsible for films such as The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Fargo. In their latest film Hail, Caesar! we follow a movie producer played by Josh Brolin, who during the 50's struggle to make films and at the same time handle difficult actors, directors and journalists. The film has a comical attitude much like their earlier film Burn After Reading, which I didn't really like. My expectations before watching this film, was that the brothers would find their way back to the fantastic comical timing they had in The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Unfortunately they didn't succeed in doing so.<br/><br/>Films about old Hollywood and its filmmaking are interesting and funny because they usually contain a lot of hilarious tributes to people in the industry. Here the Coen brothers makes parody on the likes of Charlton Heston, Gene Kelly and the successful director Vincente Minnelli. Hail, Caesar! fires wildly in all directions. Angry journalist threats, unwanted pregnancies and the constant communist menace. The problem with this is that I don't really know in which direction the Coen brothers wants to go, or what they really want to say. Communism versus capitalism and that not everything is black and white? I guess you should also see it as a sort of parody on Hollywood's paranoia towards communists during the 60's and 60's.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar! is a fun film. The production design and construction of Hollywood in the 50's is very nicely done. It also takes another turn when George Clooney's character in the film is shooting a picture of the old Roman Empire and also draws parallels to communism. I do however doubt if the Coen siblings really meant for it all to blend together in the diffuse way it did. I wonder if they actually had a more clear plan from the beginning. It probably would have raised my grade for the film if its focus and direction were better. However, I still think it is an interesting and funny picture and therefore I still grade it a six."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked like exactly the sort of film that would be made as ""Oscar bait"", and it definitely was one I wanted to see, directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Raising Arizona, Fargo, No Country for Old Men, True Grit). Basically set in the 1950s, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is head of production at Capitol Pictures, and also a ""fixer"", keeping scandalous the behaviour of stars out of the press, the story follows a day in his life. Unmarried synchronised swimming actress DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) becomes pregnant, so Mannix arranges the baby to be put in foster care and then adopt it without revealing herself as the mother, Mannix also has to fend off identical twin sister rival gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton). The studio's major production is Hail, Caesar!, an epic set in ancient Rome, but filming is halted when its leading star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is drugged by a Lurking Extra (Wayne Knight), he passes out and is abducted from the sound stage, he wakes in a beach house and meets ""The Future"", a Communist group, made up of mostly writers, they explain their cause and win him over Whitlock. Mannix receives a ransom demand from ""The Future"", demanding $100,000, he arranges to get the money from the Accounting Department, Thora Thacker meanwhile threatens Mannix to release an article about a scandal involving earlier film On Wings With Eagles, he negotiates for her to postpone the story in exchange for information about the romantic lives of several actors. Meanwhile the studio want to broaden the appeal of singing Western film star Hobie Doyle (Blue Jasmine's Alden Ehrenreich), so he is cast in the latest period drama helmed by posh British director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), but Laurentz complains to Mannix that Doyle is hopelessly inept, but Mannix tells Laurentz Doyle's role is non-negotiable and he should coach Doyle to give a better performance, Doyle himself admits to Mannix he feels the part is outside his comfort zone, but Mannix reassures him. That evening Doyle follows instructions to attend the premiere of one his Westerns, with starlet Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio), he is initially disappointed his singing is seen as comedic rather than heartfelt as he intended, but he warms to it as the audience react positively. Following the premiere Doyle and Valdez visit a nightclub and continue a genuinely developing chemistry, before being interrupted by both Thacker sisters looking for a scoop on their relationship. Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) is the star of a sailor comedy musical film, seen filming earlier with an elaborate song and dance number called ""No Dames"", Doyle spots him picking up a briefcase, it contains the ransom money, Doyle recognises it and follows Gurney to the beach house in Malibu. Doyle finds only Whitlock inside, ""The Future"" members have rowed away in a boat, with Gurney, so he can rendezvous with a Soviet submarine and move to Russia, Gurney boards and is given the money, but his dog jumping into his arms causes him to drop the briefcase into the ocean, it sinks. Doyle takes Whitlock back to the studio, while the police arrive at the beach house to arrest the group, Whitlock tries to explain his Communist leanings to Mannix, he cuts him off sharply and slaps his face numerous times, ordering him to finish Hail, Caesar! Thora then meets Manniz and explains her article about On Wings With Eagles will reveal that Whitlock got the role in the film by having sex with Laurentz, her information comes from Gurney, but Mannix persuades her that he is a Communist and she will ruin her reputation. In the end DeeAnna marries surety agent Joseph Silverman (Jonah Hill), who had agreed to take her child into foster care, and Mannix decides to reject the offer from The Lockheed Corporation of a high-level executive position, and continue working at Capitol. Also starring Frances McDormand as film editor C. C. Calhoun, Alison Pill as Mrs. Mannix, This Is the End's David Krumholtz as Communist Writer, Short Circuit's Fisher Stevens as Communist Writer, Highlander's Christopher Lambert as Scandinavian filmmaker Arne Seslum (most likely the father of DeeAnna's child), John Bluthal as Professor Marcuse and Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo as Rabbi, and narrated by Sir Michael Gambon. Eddie Mannix was a real- life ""fixer"", Brolin plays him well, Clooney is good as the slow- witted good looking actor, Fiennes and Swinton do well in their supporting roles, Johansson gets a good water-based dance routine, and the highlight of the film is Tatum as the homoerotic star in a sailor suit in a flawless bar dance routine. Critics said this film was good fun, but perhaps there isn't much of a story or gripping plot to go with, I agree a little with that, but it doesn't matter, the brightly coloured costumes and scenery is fantastic, most of the slapstick and jokes work, and you really get drawn into the feel of the period, it is definitely a knowing film about what Hollywood would like you to think it is like, a watchable comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Production Design. Very good!"

","I love the Coen brothers. They are responsible for some of my favourite comedy films including The Big Lebowski and Fargo so naturally i had high hopes for Hail, Caeser! Amazing star studded cast, interesting premise and a brilliant trailer. The film isn't quite to scale of those classics but it is a very solid film and i did have a lot of fun watching it.<br/><br/>Hail, Caeser! Is the name of a film within a film that provides the backbone of the movie. Josh Brolin is a top Hollywood screenwriter, Ed Mannix and George Clooney plays his leading man Baird Whitlock. When Baird is kidnapped from the set Ed wonders to himself why?! And that is about all i can say because the trailers are vague and i want everyone to go into this film not knowing too much because i guarantee you will have a better time. Now i did mention the cast is star-studded but by that i mean they all have very small roles. Clooney and Brolin are the only characters who get a huge amount of screen time and the story very much revolves around them, which is fine because they both shine. Especially Clooney walkibg around in an amusing roman get up. Scarlett Johansson shows up and does well as always but for a very limited and almost pointless time. Jonah Hill, he is just a cameo. I was excited to see how Jonah Hill would fare in a Coens brothers film but he appears for probably 30 seconds or less. Channing Tatum is great too though, he adds comedic flair but also has a big role to play in the main storyline.<br/><br/>Can i recommend Hail Caeser to a variety of audiences? Yes i can. Fans of the Coens will have a good time, media students like myself and screenwriters will have a good time and i believe general moviegoers will enjoy themselves too. There are a good few laugh out loud moments and it is a lot of fun unravelling the bigger picture. Like i said, not quite a classic yet, but maybe it can reach cult status in years to come."

","I love the coen brothers. Raising Arizona is one of my favourite comedies, Fargo is great and No Country For Old Men is one of my favourite movies, so going into this I was rather hopeful. I left happy but a bit disappointed. <br/><br/>The film centres around the day in the life of a Hollywood executive, at least for the most part. There are so many different characters and stories going on at once, that the film gets rather muddled. It really needed to just focus on one aspect, instead of multiple stories.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone is great, they really make their characters feel like real people. And Alden Ehrenreich came out of nowhere, he was fantastic.<br/><br/>I feel the set design and the costume design are the best parts of the film. The costumes look like they are from the time period, and so do all the sets and locations. They really make it feel like it is the 1950's. And the films in production in this Hollywood studio are also really well designed and planned out. Channing Tatums major scene in the film really shows how much care the coen brothers put into this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography from Roger Deakins is also excellent. And the score fits the time period perfectly.<br/><br/>However the faults lie in the script and the story telling. It's narratively not engaging and it's not as funny as it should have been. I feel I could push it to an 8/10 if it were funnier, but it wasn't. It was funny don't get me wrong, but it's not as funny as say Raising Arizona. <br/><br/>But overall it's a fun time at the movies and it might get better on a second viewing."

","The trailer makes the movie look spectacular - and the set-pieces on various film sets are indeed hilarious and masterful. The acting - wow - Scarlett Johannsen and Alden Ehrenreich especially are revelations as is George Clooney playing way against type, not for the first time for the Coens.<br/><br/>But the story - where to begin? It's a promising set up. Josh Brolin plays Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood studio's fixer that prevents the stars terrible life choices landing said studio in the reputational mire. But with a lucrative job offer to go to Lockheed Martin, we feel that Mannix will be okay regardless, so the stakes are really low for him, meaning we just don't care when Clooney is kidnapped by a Communist cell, it's just another day in his whacky life that he can jump ship from any time<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, with Mannix embarking on his first fix that we see - stopping a starlet creating images the studio owns the copyright to - we initially feel in somewhat darker LA Confidential territory. I think if they had continued with this tone and really added impossible pressure on pressure to Mannix it could have really given something for him to divulge in those confessional scenes and been a huge - and hilarious - winner.<br/><br/>It's a crying shame that this amount of imagination and recreation of a Hollywood heyday isn't more compelling, funny and more illustrative of why we will always need Movies and Movie Stars."

Joe McCarthy tried to warn us of these SOBs, Arthur Millar tried to warn us of a supposed modern-day witchhunt, but the Coens finally managed to capture them all in full glorious detail. Nothing witchy about them. They love Joe Stalin, they are portly intellectuals who could bore the hell out of a dead sloth, and they conspire against the US of A. Thanks for the heads-up, Coens! I had great fun. Many scenes are brilliant, unknown actors star, stars appear in bit parts. Again, an excellent movie.

The 50s have never looked better on-screen with their incredible direction and charming screenplay. Roger Deakins teams up with the Bros. yet again with some of the most stunning visuals seen this year. It's unfortunate that this film has seen mostly bad reviews, and I can see where most people are coming from when I read through them. But as with all of the Coen Bros. films, the audience is split right down the middle. You either love or you hate, there is no in between. I personally found this to be a wonderful experience, I chuckled countable times throughout and whilst it's not the most complex story, there definitely is one present. I've seen a few people say it's just a lot of random scenes thrown together, but I didn't think it was like that at all. The best way to watch a film is to go in with no expectations. I saw this thinking it was going to be bad because I had read reviews but I came out with a smile on my face. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin and George Clooney steal the screen with their ingenious and genuine performances, given the circumstances of the plot. The advertising may have you believe there's a lot of big names featured in the film - Jonah Hill is one of them - but they only have a short amount of screen time. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant in his scenes with Alden Ehrenreich, truly great chemistry and very simple writing, but the way it was delivered made it seem genius.<br/><br/>Music by returning regular Carter Burwell was just as great as his previous work with the Coen's and approaches with huge choirs and orchestral movements. It feels aged and this is what is so brilliant about his work on this film. It blends in perfectly. Another beautiful score I'll be purchasing.<br/><br/>The Coen's direct in such a complex way, that you can watch their films over and over again and pick up on things you may have missed the first time round. They capture the art of filmmaking in the 50s to a tee. It's a comedy satire, and it's extraordinarily good. The musical & dance numbers are also surprisingly catchy and fun to watch. Overall, it's not hilariously funny - but then it's not hilariously bad, either. It's a nice medium.<br/><br/>My verdict; Hail, Caesar! triumphs in its old fashioned and simple storytelling and will not disappoint the fans. Spend a day in 1950s Hollywood and see this film in cinemas.<br/><br/>Hail, Caesar!, 9/10."

Written and directed by the Coens the story involves a producer who is trying to get everything right in Capitol Pictures, and is faced with a major problem: His star has been kidnapped by an organization called The Future. What this movie is trying to show through the lens of the amazing Roger Deakins is the beauty of filming that was all shot back then in studios. We passed by almost most types of movies: Musicals ""Kelly Style"", Drama, Western and of course the main set was the Hail Cesar one, the kind of epic ""Ben Hur Style"". The movie is full of cameos of very talented actors that were given a screenplay of pure and smart comedy lines directed in a crazy and fun way by the Coens! Josh Brolin took the lead by giving an awesome performance as the producer. What people didn't enjoy in this I guess is those smart comedy moments and characters that maybe only a true Coen fan can enjoy! Not the best Coen, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was by far better but I really suggest it for all cinema lovers."

","A few weeks back I wrote about Bridge of Spies and I was mentioning the fact that I expected more than an OK+ story about the Cold War from a script written by the Joel and Ethan Coen brothers. This feeling was now enhanced by viewing Hail, Ceasar!. The trailer was so promising - the anti-establishment brothers made a film about the Hollywood. George Clooney as the drunken (not even, actually) star in the historic super-production. Scarlett Johansson as the blonde brainless starlet. The bigger the expectations, the deeper the disappointment, they say. The brothers seem to have ran out almost completely of ideas and spices.<br/><br/>Hollywood loves making fun of itself, but never forgets to mix a dose of nostalgia. This is what made The Artist such a huge success, plus of course the French charm. It's 2016 however, and nostalgia should not be consumed in overwhelming doses. Yet, the Coen brothers seem almost to crawl in repentance to the big studios they succeeded to teach in the past a few things about digging for gold in the classical fabric of American stories. There is only one scene where the Coen spin and spirit succeed to remind the good old days - that's the 'ecumenical' discussion in preparation of the Christ movie with the participation of Catholic, Easter-Orthodox and Protestant priests plus one rabbi. It looked and sounded like a good joke. The difference is that we used to have ten or more such good jokes in the Coen brothers films, now it was just one. The social content which is also present in many of their films is now reduced to a parody of the black-listing of the 50s combined with an incarnation of Communist hysteria (in a Malibu villa by the ocean of all places) which is maybe the second good joke in the film. Still insufficient.<br/><br/>In a season that was so deprived of comedies that The Martian got a nomination in the category at the Golden Globes, Hail, Ceasar! is still the funniest show in town, but it's more by lack of competition. George Clooney and Scarlett Johansson looked genuinely bored in a film which should have been fun to make. Josh Brolin is no comedy actor. The ones lucky to get more interesting parts are the amazing Tilda Swinton, and Ralph Fiennes who left me with the dilemma of guessing which film director he took revenge upon when building his character.<br/><br/>I am waiting for the Coen brothers to return."

"smartygirl","5","0","2","28 February 2016"," If you love old movies, you're be disappointed by this
","Hail, Caesar! fails to deliver on its promise of a send-up of the filmic confections of Hollywood's golden age. There are two fundamental problems: pacing and performance.<br/><br/>For an homage to rise above pastiche, the actors need to believe in their roles. They can't mock, they need to be who they are mocking. Most of the actors here seemed to be phoning it in. ""I can do a pretty good Gene Kelly impression."" ""You want '40s dame, I can give you '40s dame."" Impressions don't work in a movie. No one cares about an impressionist. And here's the thing: if you're doing Gene Kelly in ""On the Town,"" you need a better dancer. At least the chorus should have been better dancers. No shame having the background outshine the leads in a big musical number, in fact it's a grand old tradition (see John Brascia in ""White Christmas"" - since Donald O'Connor was too busy and his role went to Danny Kaye, there was no male lead of Vera-Ellen's calibre for the dance numbers). If you watch the actual movies from this era, you'll notice that every dancer is *on*. Every last member of the chorus is giving it 110% every minute that they're on screen. Not a single sailor in Channing Tatum's big dance scene - including Channing Tatum - seems to be enjoying himself. They all look like they're worried about putting a foot wrong. Periodically flashing a smile on cue, but generally a bit serious and glum.<br/><br/>One could argue that Tatum's character seemed distracted because he was actually embroiled in a communist plot, but in that era, no minor or major crisis would stop you from giving it all on screen and smiling regardless. Just ask Judy Garland. George Clooney got it; he bought his character. What he did in the crucifixion scene is what they should have been trying to do the whole film - the performer buying it whole hog and giving a million percent, despite his own apathetic and mercenary feelings about the whole business. And sweeping everyone up in that magic.<br/><br/>And the dames. Tilda Swinton didn't even try. And where was wardrobe? Her clothing could have been amazing if it fit properly, or was at least properly steamed and pressed - especially since the ""lesser"" twin looked more put together. Why was Scarlett Johansson's Deeanna character even in the film? As yet another crisis to make Eddie's day worse? She didn't seem interested enough to care, or make anyone else care. You have to wonder if there was more to this story, if it was initially connected in some way to the plot, but was cut because the story was dragging.<br/><br/>And it was dragging. Oh how it dragged. At some point around the two-hour mark (or so it felt) it occurred to me, all of this is happening in one day. Why doesn't it feel manic? Why is there no pace to this film? It's as though everyone took a Valium on their way to the set. This was especially glaring in the un-snappy '40s dame dialogue - didn't they make the actresses sit down and watch a few Barbara Stanwyck movies for research? They should have. Or, they should have gotten the amped-up court drummer from Danny Kaye's knighthood scene in The Court Jester to come in and get everyone to just speed things up a whole lot. Yea verily yea! If they had picked up the pace, given it that manic sense that was totally lacking, fleshed out the Deeanna story a bit so it was relevant (and fast-paced), that would have also allowed for more contrast with the slower parts of the film - Eddie going to confession, Eddie at home with his family. As it was, it all dragged on with the same lumbering gait.<br/><br/>There were other little annoyances. The makeup wasn't too period (I guess none of the actresses wanted their eyebrows messed with?) although that is certainly also true of period films of '40s and '50s. The ill-fitting wardrobe was pure carelessness on behalf of the filmmakers. The Roman soldiers couldn't march in step. All of these little details seem petty to complain about, but each one takes the viewer a little farther away from the picture.<br/><br/>And there were good moments, too. Heather Goldenhersh as the secretary, and most especially Alden Ehrenreich as cowboy crooner Hobie was brilliant. He looked the part, he acted the part, he believed what he was doing. And apparently he really did learn how to make a lasso out of spaghetti.<br/><br/>Overall, it felt like a series of set pieces. Let's do an Esther Williams number. Let's do On the Town. I swear, every single character seemed lifted from somewhere else - even the cabal of communist writers seemed like a pale echo of Billy Wilder's gang of academics in Ball of Fire.<br/><br/>If you love the old movies, this will leave you feeling let down. Skip it and re-watch Singin' in the Rain instead."
"rubenm","6","0","1","25 February 2016"," Irrational exuberance
","When Alan Greenspan warned against irrational exuberance, back in '96, he was talking about the stock market. But the Coen Brothers could use the same warning. Their best films are brilliant in their simplicity. Examples: Blood Simple, Fargo, Barton Fink. The story can be summarized in a few lines, there are relatively few characters, and the cinematography is sober.<br/><br/>'Hail, Caesar' is the complete opposite. It has an intricate story with lots of different characters. The cinematography is exuberant and sumptuous. But the result is disappointing. The deadpan jokes, the sharp edged dialogue, the mildly bizarre characters that make other Coen movies so entertaining, have made way for slapstick humor and outrageous scenes.<br/><br/>The film is a work of skill, because the Coen Brothers are expert film makers. And the actors are good, although most have little screen time and some are overdoing it. But the film is not extremely funny, neither particularly exciting. The pastiches of classic Hollywood scenes are the best parts, but the story about a Hollywood troubleshooter running from one disaster to the other feels as if the brothers have put too many ideas and characters into a single movie.<br/><br/>It's not the first time the Coen Brothers poke fun at Hollywood. They did the same thing when they made Barton Fink. But that film was infinitely more intelligent, funny and entertaining than this one."

","I enjoyed it while watching it - maybe even immensely. But when it ended, something intruded into my consciousness and I decided it was rather silly and unsubstantial.<br/><br/>You know - making those kinds of judgments can color how you really feel - not that you shouldn't ever make them. But it's lazy thinking. Later, in the company of close friends, I was asked about the movie, and I let the laziness get out and just said it was rather moronic.<br/><br/>As I've been thinking about it more and more, I want to say it was amazing in many respects. The Coen Bros never give you what you're expecting- or what other filmmakers might have done in their place. That's why they're the Coen Bros.<br/><br/>Cloony in one of his great performances. Terrific scenes of movie shooting back in the day. Tilda Swinton in great duel roles. Brolin is beyond fantastic. Fienes also remarkably funny in a small role. Incredibly funny cowboy stunts. Hilarious dialogue. Technically incredible. <br/><br/>The only question is what is this movie saying to us? A fair question. I'm not sure. I have a few theories. So what? It's wonderful.<br/><br/>Hail Caesar. Go see it. Amazing."
"AliceofX","5","0","3","23 February 2016"," Confusing
","Well, this was confusing. Somewhere underneath there is a smart story that is unfortunately buried under several plot threads and a revolving door of characters that come and go before you have a chance to know them. Even the main leads don't leave much of an impression on you and nobody's story is really fleshed out.<br/><br/>That's my biggest problem is just how short this movie feels. It's like a 2+ hour film that got cut to just the basics of the story. It all feels rushed and hasty.<br/><br/>But Hail, Caesar is not all bad. It's an entertaining film with great humour and many laugh out loud scenes. It has a story with some interesting metaphors about religion. An okay film, in short. But since it's the Coen brothers you naturally expect something more. At least something that isn't a confusing mess.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this film to people who are already fans of the Coen brothers style. If you are one of them this film might of be of interest to you, but I'm not sure what it would do to anyone else. Overall it is a mediocre film."

","It's a 7. Plain and simple. It wasn't extraordinarily funny. It did have good moments. It had some fine quirkiness. It was very enjoyable. <br/><br/>But, it wasn't a great Coen movie. They've made better. The setting, the actors, the basic story line were all there. The problem was simply that the script was a bit slow moving and not excessively funny. <br/><br/>The film had a good message (as nearly all Coen brothers films do); but it just did not have the depth of humor that, say, O Brother, Fargo, or others did. <br/><br/>I thought that Clooney was okay - sometimes very funny other times clichÃ©. Brolin was very good but he just didn't quite have the dialogue to make his role exceptional. <br/><br/>That's not to say there weren't some funny scenes nor that it was not enjoyable. It was, but it just lacked oomph! So, it's middling to good. Better than a 6. But no better than a 7."

"darkknight3993-1","6","0","1","10 February 2016"," The politics of popcorn
","Hail, Caesar! is a pleasant stroll through a fake 50's Hollywood studio starring mostly fictional characters who live their lives through the fantasies that their producers create. Though each scene shines spectacularly on its own, the movie never has any weighty moments to really tie the audience in and leave a significant lasting impression. However, the Coen Brothers nail the comedic moments, ultimately delivering a satisfying, and overall entertaining film.<br/><br/>Most of the film is viewed through the lens of Eddie Mannix, a real Hollywood film executive whose job it is to manage the circus-like freak show that is his production studio. Many pressing issues of the time period are briefly covered; everything from the Red Scare to homosexuality has a part to play, but the film never clearly elaborates on these heavier points. Instead, we are shown a series of small anecdotes that are shown to be regular, day to day happenings in the wacky life of the film industry. Since most of the situations ride on the edge of incredulity, the film feels more satirical than historical. <br/><br/>Out of all the amazing actors on this project, Alden Ehrenreich's surprisingly on point portrayal of a pseudo-realistic cowboy movie star really stole the show. Josh Brolin and Channing Tatum played their parts charmingly as well; however, I felt Clooney and Johansson's characters left more to be desired. Even though the rest of the cast had smaller parts than those aforementioned, they all played their eccentrically written parts well enough. The Coen's rapid fire dialogue pulled the film along, but never really provided an interesting narrative to follow. While I sympathized with Mannix's struggle, I never really bought into the Baird Whitlock kidnapping arc, which is what initially seemed like the main plot. Despite narrative-related short comings, clever dialogue and sharp acting really pulled the film together.<br/><br/>Though the Coen brothers hinted at deeper themes throughout the film, the only politics truly explored were those of the popcorn munching flicks of old. Funny, witty, yet shallow, Hail, Caesar! provides a solid hour and a half of entertainment."
"swilliky","6","0","4","7 February 2016"," Great performances and direction as expected from the Cohen brothers!
","The Cohen brothers have another fun and intriguing film with a star-studded cast and even managed to introduce some new faces to the viewing public. The most arresting performance was that of Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix, a fixer or director of physical production for the fiction studio Capitol Pictures. The time period is old Hollywood 1950s and the rise of Communism is a subplot in the film. Brolin really steals the show and adds another great role to his impressive career.<br/><br/>Another cast member with a big name draw was George Clooney as an oafish star who ends up captured by a mysterious group known as the future. Clooney thrives as the moron Baird Whitlock and delivers a humorous performance.<br/><br/>For more of this review and others check out swilliky.com"
