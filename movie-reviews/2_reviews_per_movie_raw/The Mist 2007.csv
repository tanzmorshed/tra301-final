"gogoschka-1","Null","73","89","27 March 2019"," Fantastic Lovecraftian Horror And Hard-Hitting Political Allegory: One Of The Most Faithful King Adaptations To Date
","In the hands of a lesser filmmaker than Frank Darabont and processed through the mind of a typical studio screenwriter (like, for example, Akiva Goldsman), a Hollywood film adaptation of Stephen King's novella THE MIST would undoubtedly have become your run-of-the-mill monster movie: creatures from another dimension devour people trapped in a mall (presumably the monsters pick them off one-by-one, ten-little-Indians style). But the most captivating thing in King's story is not really the plot about the monsters and the ""breach"" into another dimension (although I love that idea): it's how the human characters react to it and what happens between them.<br/><br/>In staying faithful to the source material, Darabont uses the microcosm consisting of the people trapped in a small town supermarket to explore the dynamics and power shifts that happen very quickly within a society when a powerful outside threat appears. Just like King's excellent novella, the film is a hard hitting allegory for how easily even seemingly civilized countries become susceptible to the messages of demagogues when they are faced with a serious crisis. And it not only manages to perfectly capture the subtext and political undercurrent of the novel, Darabont's film also gives the audience a true sense of the Lovecraftian horror King unleashed on the page. As it is, THE MIST isn't just one of the most faithful King adaptations to date, it's one of the best horror films of the new millennium.<br/><br/>P.S.

","On first impressions The Mist doesn't remotely seem like the kind of film anyone should be excited about. The Mist, what? A bit like The Fog, then. Stephen King's The Mist, oh, that makes it even worse. Directed by Frank Darabont, since when did he direct horror films? Okay, so he scripted Nightmare on Elm Street 3 and The Blob, not bad films, but not classics in any sense. Starring Thomas Jane, has anyone seen The Punisher. And, to cap it all, The Mist died a quick death at the US box office. It'll probably go straight to DVD in the UK.<br/><br/>The only reason I bought and watched the film was on a recommendation from a friend. He pleaded: ""You have to see this film. You won't believe how good it is."" So I put his judgement to the test.<br/><br/>And thank God. This is a great horror film. From the opening scene, Darabont sets a tone that's creepy, sinister and beautifully judged. The script is realistic, the character are believable and the direction... Darabont has almost reinvented himself. The Mist is dark, scary and even funny (intentionally). You care about the characters, the scary scenes are scary, and the whole film is carried off with an efficiency, a lack of pretension and a strong idea of what makes a good, if not great, horror film.<br/><br/>And the ending... how dark can you get? I can understand why this didn't do well at the box office. But neither did Shawshank Redemption..."
"Gatecrasherfilms","9","477","696","22 November 2007"," ""The Mist"" is worth watching!
","I've been a member of IMDb for many years now and rarely do I take the time to comment on a film. In addition, I watch, on average, about 10-15 films a month, split among all genres including horror. Lately though, I've been very disenfranchised with most horror films especially with the proliferation of shock/gore/splatter/torture-porn films such as Hostel 2, The latest Saw film, Captivity, etc. Enter ""The Mist"" and I leave the theater saying to myself ""this is why I go see movies"".<br/><br/>Frank Darabont should be the only one adapting Steven King novels and short stories...period. He brings a human balance that's missing in most horror films these days. You can have the most unbelievable, and maybe even the most ludicrous, situations and events, but if you make the characters believable and further peel the layers to expose fear, prejudices and vulnerability then you have the foundations towards making an effective film. I was absolutely gripped during the entire film, and that all-too-rare-these-days sense of dread permeates through almost every scene and left me emotionally exhausted at the end. And speaking of the ending, isn't that what almost everyone is talking about? I'm not going to give anything away, but in my opinion, I loved it. I can see why it can split into camps of ""loved it""/""didn't like it"" but for me it was a great conclusion to the entire storyline of the human condition. I wouldn't have changed a thing."

","I'll start out by saying that I'm a Stephen King fan and thus I may have some bias. I've watched many Steven King movies but have never given one a rating this high. Most of his horror movies are in the 4-6 range with classics such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and The Green Mile ranking 8-10 (although two of those aren't technically horror movies). In most modern horror (like the Saw series) there is a greater emphasis on gore than the horror of the human condition and this movie, kudos to the actors, help weave a tale that disgusts you inside and out without the pure reliance on blood spatter (although granted there is a fair amount of that).<br/><br/>Thomas Jane (leading male and well known from The Punisher) has a brilliant and emotional portrayal of his character in a mind-blowing situation that we feel intimately associated with thanks to his acting and great directing. Laurie Holden (of X-Files and Silent Hill fame) has a more subdued performance but plays her role well and for any X-Files nut (such as myself) it's fun to see her in another movie. The cast is chock full of well known actors and some unknowns that really see and express the writer and directors vision. It pays off: They succeed in pulling you into a traumatic situation made worse with a mixture of religious zealotry, military conspiracy, and small-town ignorance that explodes in your face wondering if your humanity is worse off facing The Mist or the human condition.<br/><br/>There is no spoiler here but I will say this about the ending: It's what makes the movie and makes it so much better than most of the crap put out there in horror land. Yes, yes, getting cut in half and having limbs ripped-off is horrible. However it is the decisions we have to make that concern those we love and respect that can really drive one mad. The ending makes you look at yourself and wonder, if given the same situation, what you would have to do with the information you have available. It makes you think hard about your humanity and your soul and about what is right or wrong in any given situation involving our mortality.<br/><br/>I would suggest this movie to anyone that likes horror or science fiction and wants something a little more intense than, say, Army of Darkness (one of my personal favorites for totally different reasons). This movie deals with serious issues we hear about daily. The mist is just a piece of Science Fiction thrown in to bring out the best...and worst in us.<br/><br/>Enjoy!!"
"hoobits","10","473","736","25 November 2007"," Classic Horror in a Post Modern age
","Let me take a breath... Never have I had such a visceral physical reaction to a film... ever. Not even with Elem Klimov's Come and See. In the last fifteen minutes I was nearly physically paralyzed, and then started shaking, realizing how numb my body was... and I am dead serious. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella goes heads above a 50s/60s monster movie homage. This is grade ""A"" chilling, terrifying, unsettling and utterly hopeless cinema in line with the most cynical and depressing classics from the 70s. The Mist itself and the monsters it brings are just the appetizer here. As all good horror should be, this explores the ultimate enemy, ourselves. In short one of the most beautiful, thrilling and terrible times I've had at the movies.<br/><br/>To elaborate, it isn't a pitch perfect film... Some of the CGI at the beginning is weak, and there are a few lines that can't escape the genre, but other than that this is a home run in every department - The performances (especially from Toby Jones and Marcia Gay Harden), the ingenious hand held camera, which is never used as a gimmick. The sound design, the lack of an underscore... This lends to the great atmosphere and tension Darabont builds. I'm sure you can guess by now this isn't schmaltzy, sentimental Darabont here; this is an angry, maniacal man that rears his head and shouts, ""Everything is lost!"" and then shoots you in the gut. Any fan of Stephen King, The Twilight Zone or Ray Bradbury, will greedily devour this with a great big grin on their face, then feel very sick but so damn happy and then throw up. Best film of the year yet."
"mstomaso","8","232","354","3 May 2008"," The Humanity of Horror
","If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont's (writing and directing) The Mist adapts a horror novella of the same name. King's horror work has been the most difficult material to adapt, but this film is comparable to other genre stand-outs such as The Shining and 1408.<br/><br/>A brief, dramatic thunderstorm is followed by a freak mist that descends on a small New England town. As the mist permeates the town, people congregate in the local supermarket and hardware store to stock up and gather supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane), his son (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor (Andre Braugher) are among them. Tension builds as a steady stream of military vehicles pass through the mist headed south from a nearby base. But serious concern doesn't start until one of the locals runs to the supermarket with blood spatters on his clothing and talking of monsters in the mist.<br/><br/>Indeed, there are horrors outside in the fog, but there are also horrors inside the market - as paranoia, irrationality and religion come into conflict with practical issues of survival.<br/><br/>Unlike many horror films, The Mist examines fear and its effects realistically, looks at the horror created by forces beyond human control and the even more terrifying horror that fear creates through forces that are completely within our grasp - our own fears, our beliefs and our treatment of each other. It does so using a classic formula which is comparable to films like Night of the Living Dead and, more recently, Feast.<br/><br/>The cinematography, editing and directing are all excellent. The acting is quite good - Marcia Gay Harden and William Sadler stood out for me - and the script is exactly where it needed to be for this adaptation.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for King fans and horror fans. Recommended for Sci-Fi fans. Weakly recommended for average cinema-goers who are not generally interested in horror."
"the_li","8","148","222","1 July 2008"," A great film with awesome depth of characters
","I won't go into details as I don't want to ruin this film for everyone, but I will highly recommend it! One warning: Do not watch this film expecting a cheesy/entertaining horror, or even a high-quality entertaining slasher as this film is -all- about the characters and how extreme circumstances can bring out the extreme sides of human nature.<br/><br/>By the end of the film I was literally on the edge of my seat - cider forgotten - with my hand over my mouth.<br/><br/>Masterfully written screenplay (from the original short story by Stephen King) and masterfully directed, anyone who is generally sceptical about adaptations of Stephen King ""horrors"" will be rewarded by watching this, Frank Darabont has done a typically marvelous job (see Shawshank and Green Mile) and well and truly delivered."
"seawalker","8","157","237","28 July 2008"," Wonderful, horrific, twisted and shocking
","Pop quiz. Tell me, what do you consider to be the most successful Stephen King adaptation, made for film or television? ""Carrie""? ""The Dead Zone""? ""Salem's Lot""? ""Stand By Me""? No! Not ""Maximum Overdrive""!! (And if that is your choice, may God forgive you, because I won't.)<br/><br/>All of the above, except ""Maximium Overdrive"" of course, are great pieces of work. But my choice as the benchmark Stephen King adaptation would probably be ""The Shawshank Redemption"", directed by Frank Darabont.<br/><br/>Stephen King has been very good for Frank Darabont. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has become a modern classic and ""The Green Mile"" was nearly as good. I am glad to say that ""The Mist"" is nearly as good again.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is a great film, perfectly structured, but a film that requires patience. It is a film of the slow build and of a gradual getting to know the characters, their obsessions, their fears and prejudices. It was nice to see a King horror film where his great talent of touching on the reality of a small town, has been exploited. It makes it all the more horrific when all hell does break loose, because the people who are getting hurt are ones that you know.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is faintly wooden. Personally I would not have cast him, but all of the other performances are top notch. Marcia Gay Harden's possibly psychotic, fundamental Christian, Toby Jones' short, pudgy, perfectly ordinary hero, Andre Braugher's uptight, big city lawyer and William Sadler's scared, malleable blue collar worker. All excellent.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is not ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in one crucial way. Whereas ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was about hope and life, ""The Mist"" is about hopelessness and death. One thing that they have in common is an astonishing ending. The ending of ""The Mist"" is wonderful, horrific, twisted and shocking. Not anything that I saw coming.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is marvellous. Must see."
"pnarco","8","286","451","2 December 2007"," This King adaptation gets it right
","I was very impressed by this adaptation of Stephen King's 'The Mist'. I have been a fan of the story since it came out and have played the text game and have heard the 3-D audio version of it. This is a masterful suspense/monster movie that puts an ensemble cast into the untenable situation of being in a deteriorating situation they cannot escape from. We watch as alliances are formed, religious paranoia takes hold and, nicely, the movie takes the time to establish characters whom we come to care for before the true action begins. I dock it a couple of points because some of the monsters seemed a little too cgi, and the middle lags a bit, but the much talked about ending is indeed awesome and I was most impressed by the director's decision to keep the music soundtrack down and even eliminate it completely during many of the action sequences. So many movies nowadays crank the music up to 11 to make up for the fact that their suspense scenes do not work. This movie does. I was breathlessly on the edge of my seat for most of it, even though I was already familiar with the story. Highly recommended."
"email-1013","10","116","176","20 April 2008"," A great horror movie and a great deal more!
","Most modern horror movie are simply ((insert expletive here)) these days. They either end up as a PG13 (ooh, scary!) or they end up with the hero winking into the camera and riding off into the sunset.<br/><br/>The Mist does none of this. It is scary, violent and follows through to a logical, hardcore horror ending. The last horror film this good was 28 Days Later (kinda) or the Dawn of the Dead redo (for sure).<br/><br/>I don't need spoilers to get across that if you're a horror fan and you want to see a good kick ass R rated horror flick, you've come to the right place. Hell, even my wife thought it kicked ass and she's a stickler for logic in movies.<br/><br/>Just make sure you're not sitting next to any plate glass windows and you'll be fine! Oh, and if you read original novella, like I did, you'll also be pleasantly surprised because THIS movie is true to the story it came from.<br/><br/>Well done Frank Darabont for directing a great Stephen King adaptation ... how about doing The Stand next?"
"Jonny_Numb","8","297","471","27 November 2007"," A Spectacular Scarefest
","While the cast and crew of ""The Mist"" will herald the Weinstein Brothers at press junkets and the like, the producing duo has made 2007's most refreshingly original horror films (""Grindhouse,"" ""Halloween"") sacrificial lambs to fright-unfriendly weekends (there's a good article on this at Dread Central.com). And while ""The Mist"" certainly commands a 30-foot screen, maybe its best possible fate lies on DVD, where viewers with surround sound and a widescreen TV can live the horrific, harrowing experience without the distraction of an audience too dumb to decipher their ticket stubs.<br/><br/>""What's wrong with Stephen King?!"" one member asked at the climax of ""The Mist,"" certain he had made an alternately incisive and hilarious comment. To which I thought, ""Had you actually read the novella, clod, you'd know that King ended on an (almost) upbeat note."" With home entertainment fast becoming the industry standard, I guess the expectation of a tactful audience is beyond reason anymore.<br/><br/>Despite the running commentary, I was able to see the treasure most of the room missed out on. As a novella, ""The Mist"" islike most of King's workpulpy, scary, and compelling. The film, written and directed by Frank Darabont, is a stunning adaptation that manages to capture the slow burn of dread and desperation that permeates the novella. And while there is an uncanny titular similarity to John Carpenter's ""The Fog,"" this is an altogether different beast.<br/><br/>The setup is simple: after a brutal storm whips through a small Maine community, movie poster artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane""Dreamcatcher"") and his son, Bill (Nathan Gamble) head into town for supplies, accompanied by Norton (Andre Braugher), their next-door neighbor. Once they arrive at a small shopping plaza, a shear mist encroaches upon them, trapping a large number of people inside a grocery store. The utter randomness of this scenario is enough to make one's skin crawl, but it turns out there are prehistoric-looking monsters waiting in the mist. And the inhabitants of the store become increasingly desperate for survival.<br/><br/>(At this juncture, I will apologize in advance for the upcoming comparisons to ""Night of the Living Dead,"" due to the sheer quantity of mentions.) <br/><br/>What follows has a lot of thematic parallels to George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead,"" a B movie whose guerrilla fearlessness and intelligence pushed it into legitimacy and legend. ""The Mist"" is as much about things-that-go-bump-against-the-plate-glass as the way in which trapped humans respond to such a fantastic situation. Like ""Night,"" the breakdown of social order and martial law is addressed; the role of the military comes into play; religious fundamentalism is personified by Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a fire-and-brimstone type who becomes a macabre, sacrifice-minded beacon to the store's desperate. In an era where most of today's horror crowd expects ""Saw XIV"" every time they walk into a theater, Darabont's script is built on a foundation of logic and authentic human action (even when characters do things we know are unwise, their rationale is convincingly fleshed-out) as opposed to manipulative twists and anticlimaxes. The ending is at once ballsy, depressing, and right. Like ""Night,"" ""The Mist"" is less about otherworldly monsters than mankind's uncanny ability to BE the monster.<br/><br/>That being said, ""The Mist"" works as well as a traditional horror film, with several genuinely scary sequences involving mutant hybrids of pterodactyls, houseflies, and spiders, with several Cthulhu-esquire unmentionables to complement their Lovecraftian backstory. The CG is well-utilized and the sharp editing keeps it from being overdone. Darabont transforms the creatureswhich are essentially '50s B-movie fodderinto absolutely convincing visions of hell. This film bucks current horror trends by actually scaring the audience instead of just repulsing them.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is one of the year's best."

"lmbiango","1","221","366","27 April 2008"," RUN!! Don't stare at it and scream!
","I really expected a lot coming into this movie considering it had a rating on this site of 7.5. The entire time I found myself yelling, ""What are you doing?!"" Almost everything the characters did was ""horror film stereotypical"". As monsters ran towards them, they stood there and screamed instead of running. The crazy lady trying to kill a ten year old child somehow had acquired a huge band of followers within 24 hours who also felt that somehow God would appreciate it it they stabbed the child to death, along with the Army guy. It made absolutely no sense why anyone would listen to her at all. They should have duct taped her mouth shut from the beginning. Overall, I was extremely annoyed by how predictable this movie was and how I felt like I needed to dumb myself down in order to watch it. I couldn't think logically about anything that was happening or else I would have turned it off, so I had to pretend that it was convincing just so I could finish watching it. The ending made me totally nauseas. No one would EVER do what this man did. You battle the monsters for days and risk your life repeatedly and then you think that running out of gas means QUIT?! No, you would not shoot two old people, your own ten year old son, and the woman holding him and spare yourself. That is ridiculous. The personalities that these people had we not the type of personalities that would accept giving up, and the fact that they didn't join the crazy lady's band of insanity shows that the man was not a psycho and would not have shot his child in the head and not himself. I realize it was to spare them from the monsters, but no one in their right mind could do that. Every ""mission"" he went on was life threatening, and all of those people put their lives at risk by getting in that car, so why commit suicide?? They wouldn't. It was stupid."
"jaredmobarak","8","239","408","23 November 2007"," You're all right Big BillThe Mist
","I always say to people that Frank Darabont is the only man who can truly make a great Stephen King adaptation. I'm not so sure I have the credentials to state that as fact, but I do anyways. I love The Shawshank Redemption, but never read Rita Hayworth and I read The Green Mile, but still have yet to watch the film. So, I can't quite compare his work with that of the author, however, that did little to temper my anticipation for his first based on a supernatural story, with The Mist. Early buzz was that he completed the hat trick; even with some unavoidable clichés inherent to the genre, he was able to create something unique and terrifying. I have to say that I agree whole-heartedly. The tale that he has spun and the performances that he has wrenched from his actors are nothing short of spectacular. With the amount of tension built up, you hardly have time to notice the somewhat mediocre effects work and token moments of horror tradition. Whereas someone less capable would have tried to tell the tale of humanity versus the otherworldly beasts outside their grocery store cage, Darabont tells it how it really isfear of the unknown turning man against man. There is no scarier monster than the one hidden inside us all.<br/><br/>We aren't given very much background at all. Thrown into the plot by a huge storm knocking power out and leaving destruction in its wake, we don't have much time before we are taken to the grocery store that becomes our setting for almost the entire duration. These are not two-dimensional characters, though, and through their conversations with each other, we glean a lot about who they are. It helps that this is a small town where everyone knows everyone, and they all make sure each other knows it. You have to love the old retired teacher calling you an underachiever right before you go out to risk your life against creatures straight from another dimension. The occupations of everyone plays into the plot course too, from a movie poster artist trying to tell the group that he saw tentacles attempting to take them out into the mist, to a lawyer doing his best to see the practicality of the situation and necessity of evidence before being convinced. They all have one thing in common, though, and that is the need for protection, the need for a herd to follow. As Armageddon plays out on the other side of the glass windows, fear takes hold, pitting faith against rationality, morality opposite ceremonial sacrifice.<br/><br/>Darabont has his cinematographer stay in very close throughout the movie. With extremely tight compositions, we are able to see the emotions and the chaos reflected by each actor's eyes. Everyone handles the pressure differently and the filmmakers don't cop-out from showing us each. The feeling leads to some claustrophobic moments, but also some wonderful action pieces, showing us the brutality and violence up close with no question or ambiguity to what happened. Towards the end, we are given a witch-hunt sequence between the zealots and the pragmatists. It is just a breathtaking piece of cinematic splendor, beautifully orchestrated despite its cruel subject matter and unabashed frankness. If you want to see grotesque, remorseless creatures, just take a glimpse at your neighbor. I'm sure it is there just below the surface, waiting for an opportunity to come up for air and latch onto the coattails of the nearest person crazy enough to think they know the answers and that they alone can lead the rest to salvation.<br/><br/>The acting is simply phenomenal. An ensemble of so many recognizable faces has been compiled and no one misses a step. Thomas Jane is devastating as the father of a young boy doing his best to keep everyone calm while taking stock of the situation in an attempt to find a way out; Toby Jones gives a nice turn as the slightly nerdy store assistant manager who is constantly walked on until his true worth is shown; and Andre Braugher is effective as the foil to Jane, their rocky relationship evolving and devolving as each minute goes by. While everyone is fantastic, it is Marica Gay Harden that becomes the real tour de force. I have never been a huge fan of hers; she is solid for sure, but usually comes off as annoying to me. Here, though, she is the most frightening character on screen. Channeling God's wishes through her demented skull leads to the separation into two factions of the survivors. If this wasn't a genre flick I'd say she had a pretty decent shot at getting her second supporting actress Oscar.<br/><br/>Every note is played to perfection. Overcoming any crutches that the nature of horror/thrillers bring with them, Darabont has crafted an emotionally draining piece of cinema that leaves the audience gasping for air as though they have been kicked in the stomach. While the fights with the bug-like creatures are effective, they only play out as the first step to the battles within soon to come. I credit all involved for keeping the tone where it needed to be in order for success. This is an R-rated tale and it pulls no punches to that effect. Whereas most films of this ilk would take a simple route out of the carnage, we are allowed to watch all play out to its unavoidable end. Maybe the finale is obvious, but evenso, it is stripped down to the basic core of emotions. I knew it was coming yet it was still devastating to experience. Fear makes us all do that which we think we could never do and, if anything, The Mist is a cautionary tale to help us remember that one crucial and unbending fact of life."

","It's sad that this movie had potential to be a good movie but is screwed up by having all that bs religious crap mid way through. Having one illogical religious fanatic is fine because its believable but to actually have that person ask for sacrifices and have 90%+ the remaining survivors comply is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.<br/><br/>She managed to blame the event on some random guy in the military and get people to stab him and throw him out of the store to be ""sacrificed to god"". Then they try to have the young kid sacrificed next. SERIOUSLY WTF. Anyone who can watch that 10-20 minutes of bs and think of this movie as great should be ashamed of themselves.<br/><br/>There were other annoying things in the movie as well but nothing that was too big of a deal but the stuff described above is just unfathomable. The ending which was a unique, interesting ending I just found myself laughing because at that point I couldn't take the movie seriously at all. I would love to see the movie without the religious lady, it would be interesting to see how good of a movie it really could have been.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have even written this if the movie was rated at most a 5.5. But for it to be rated 7.6 is mind boggling. The amount of movies rated less than 7.6 which are much more deserving then this movie is massive. I can think of plenty of movies rated 5 on IMDb that entertained me more and made me less infuriated then this one."

","I've read through a lot of these comments regarding the Mist and I am baffled as to what people actually want from a movie. The movie bombed in the US and, it seems, most of the negative reviews on here are from US or Canadian viewers. But why? Is it because you have all been spoon fed Hollywood happy ending movies for so long? Is it because you want all your movies explained to you and every detail spoon fed to you?! Do you have no imagination? Its a Monster movie. What are you doing watching this kind of movie if you have no imagination?!<br/><br/>Yes, the movie doesn't show you where the creatures come from. But it does tell you. So use your imagination. No, the film doesn't have a 'happy ending'. Why does it have to? Most good films don't - its the provocative shocking endings that stick in mind the most after the credits have finished rolling. And yes, while the people in the store might not be acting as you think they would if the events in the movie really happened, it wouldn't make an enjoyable movie if the 70 odd people trapped in the store spent the two hours of the movie running around screaming in terror, would it?<br/><br/>If you read the trivia part on this web site, you see the director actually shot a scene of the Scientist opening a rift between our world and the creatures to start the movie off but decided to take it out. And by god Im glad he did. I hate being spoon fed every last detail of a story! It adds to the mystery of the events of the film. They didn't show you where the Giant shark in 'Jaws' came from either, but that hasn't stopped it being a classic, has it?!<br/><br/>If you haven't gathered, I loved this film. And everyone i've shown it to has too. OK the CGI isn't quite top notch, but it doesn't matter when the story and the Characters are so strong. And yes, I said characters. Im not sure why people are saying they didn't get to know the characters - You'd rather spend 2 hours getting to know your characters or being entertained with a story. The fact that the film is 2 hours long means you get to know about the characters as the film progresses through their actions. For me, a 10/10 film. If you don't want you films spoon fed to you give this 'monster movie' a try. If you do want your movies spoon fed to you, stick with a Disney movie."

","**This comment has spoilers starting with the second paragraph.** Readers of Stephen King's novellas will remember The Mist as an especially chilling and intriguing thought experiment. How will a random group of people react when confronted with an utterly alien threat, which traps them together in an enclosed place by surprise, one from which there seems no possible escape, and thus makes them confront not only the danger but all the kinds of fears, hopes, and weaknesses human beings have? Other commenters, such as the featured 23 November 2007, have already discussed the good acting, dialog, editing, and tension buildup of what promises to be a solid and actually thoughtful B-movie.<br/><br/>However, Frank Darabont's oh-so-stylishly nihilistic ending destroys the movie, a big alien-bug foot (or Monty Python Foot?) crunching the story. Now nihilistic-type endings can work well, as in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982), with the last two survivors of the Antarctic station facing each other in fear, or George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), in which the last human survivor is mistakenly shot by the police.<br/><br/>Both bring the overwhelming danger to an end that makes the perceptive viewer confront horror that a merely-worldly horizon can't process; Carpenter with isolated, terrified and mutually suspicious survivors, and Romero with a man whose best shot ends with that most real of all possibilities, a random mistake.<br/><br/>In this case, however, it's just too much. The survivors have sacrificed and suffered suitably; all have been forced to confront danger (the monsters), evil (Mrs. Carmody's twisting of religion in brutal, murderous fashion to assuage her fear), random losses (Drayton's wife and the broken window), and the costs of trying to survive (the loss of Ollie Weeks and two others getting to the car). They drive along. They see more monsters, destruction, and death. And they run out of gas.<br/><br/>People have suffered, made mistakes, and died. No one could accuse Darabont, five minutes before the end, of having pulled punches in portraying King's story faithfully and with skill. No one would accuse him of a pollyanna ending if even he had Drayton & Co say try to leave the gas-empty land rover--and some of them die running to the end of the Mist that they don't know is right in front of them. Or if he had preserved King's chilling and uncertain original ending, of Drayton & co. hearing the word ""Hartford"" in radio static and holding it as their word of hope as they drive on.<br/><br/>But to have Drayton, the lead character, despair, at that last moment, and kill all these survivors, including his son, before leaving the car to die and instead being saved, sorry. That's the sledgehammer blow that ruins it. It's over the top and too much. This story is about some people staying rational through it all, confronting the range of human emotions and weaknesses one would expect in such a situation, and trying. This ending is gratuitously nihilistic and ruins the story.<br/><br/>So I say without hesitation: don't waste your time on this movie. Shame on Frank Darabont for taking a thoughtful, intriguing novella and ruining it as a film."

","I had the good fortune of catching this 2 weeks before the national release. Last night (Nov. 8th) at the Alamo Draft House in Austin, TX Frank came out and gave us a real treat.<br/><br/>The film is a real horror movie. When I say that, I mean that it hits on all cylinders that a monster movie should. The dialog can be choppy at times, there is humor but it isn't campy, the monsters are genuinely frightening and sometimes you question the characters decisions. Add all of those elements as well as a very talented VisualFX crew and you get an homage to movies that just don't get made anymore. I felt as though I was watching The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits for the first time.<br/><br/>People familiar with the story know that there isn't really an 'ending'. Well, I won't ruin it for you but Frank gives you an ending that'll stick in your head well after you leave.<br/><br/>If you like movies that serve their purpose you'll enjoy this movie, even if you aren't a horror fan. If you're a horror fan then you'll eat this up and beg for more."

","I've been a Stephen King reader since I was about 8. I've read almost everything the man has written. I'm also a HUGE Frank Darabont fan after what he did with SHAWSHANK and GREEN MILE.<br/><br/>It takes a lot to scare me, but this movie really creeped me out. From the moment The Mist rolls in over the lake toward the small town, I was hooked. Thomas Jane is fantastic in this. In fact, the entire cast knocks this one out of the park because of how realistically they play each moment. Never once did I feel like I was watching acting on the screen. Darabont sets a mood of realism with the hand held shots inside the grocery store and the organic suspense that creates.<br/><br/>Darabont has added some elements not found in the King story, but each one of them is spot on. Especially the end. It will leave you sitting in your seat, awe struck.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film more. The FX are outstanding by Greg Nicotero and Cafe FX. The creatures are great, complex and frightening. The Mist itself becomes a character.<br/><br/>The feeling of dread I got each time a character went into The Mist is such a tribute to how wonderful and masterful this film is.<br/><br/>And finally, Marcia Gay Harden and Toby Jones. Harden's character is so despicable I really began to hate her as the movie went on. But the realism of what unfolds with her, and the group of people stuck in the store, is so fantastic. And Toby Jones as Ollie was my second favorite behind Jane's character. Jones looks like he would be the quiet type, but he quickly becomes the audience favorite.<br/><br/>See this movie ASAP. And a special thanks again to Frank Darabont, Greg Nicotero, AICN and the Alamo Drafthouse for bringing this awesome film to Austin for us to see FIRST!!!!!"

","A small sleepy town. A storm. Some ominous mist. People trapped in a supermarket. Tentacles attacking. Yup, so far is seems so promising. A monster movie which builds up tension slowly, and when the creepers are first shown delivers with reasonable-looking CGI.<br/><br/>But wait. This ain't no shallow monster flick. We need to include room for characterisation. We need give the story some real depth. We need to get people thinking about stuff.<br/><br/>So many messages. Hey, let's show how when people are scared, they may do stupid things. Hey, we could include a religious nut who's crazy. And better add in some country hicks who are clearly stupid and easily misled. And of course, don't forget that big city lawyers are inevitably self-righteous and unwilling to listen to common sense. And let's show how when people care for their children, like really really care, then they will do anything for them including **spoiler for the most stupid part of the movie** shoot them. OMG, so many messages to deliver. This film is so DEEP! <br/><br/>Needless to say, what started out as a watchable horror film for the first 30 minutes suddenly transforms into one of the most irritating attempts at social commentary that's turned up on the big screen in some time. Its subtlety could be equated to being hit in the head with a sledge-hammer. Repeatedly. For 2 hours.<br/><br/>Do these directors actually _watch_ what they're cutting together? How can they not be embarrassed by their own pretentiousness, or fail to realise how low the standard of their shallow, banal drivel actually is? But at least there was good music towards the end. The loud, screaming choral interjection that suddenly bursts forth from nowhere actually had people laughing out loud in the cinema."

"The_Void","8","63","105","8 July 2008"," Another big success for Stephen King and Frank Darabont!
","Films based on the writing of Stephen King have a habit of not translating to the screen very well; although director Frank Darabont made what is often considered the best of the Stephen King films in The Shawshank Redemption - and now with The Mist he's directed what is surely one of the major contenders for the title of best horror film to be based on a Stephen King story! When I first heard the plot description, I was expecting the film to be a cross between John Carpenter's The Fog and modern horror disappointment Feast; and while it does have elements of both those movies, it is thankfully much better than both. The film starts with a violent storm that leaves the Drayton family home in tatters. David Drayton sets off to the local store along with his son and a neighbour; but the town is soon plummeted into trouble when it is surrounded by a malicious mist. It soon transpires that there are otherworldly creatures within the mist and the townsfolk in the local store find themselves battling against the creatures as well as themselves...<br/><br/>The film takes on a real classic style horror feel and never tries to be exceedingly clever or overly gory and that is one of its main strengths. Frank Darabont puts his focus mainly on the tension between the characters and the atmosphere and this benefits the film as there's always enough to keep things interesting - and that is particularly impressive when you consider the thin plot and the fact that it's over two hours long. Thomas Jane takes the lead role and gives a great performance which is nicely pitched between family man and action hero. The rest of the ensemble perform well alongside the lead actor, with Marcia Gay Harden as a fanatical Christian and Toby Jones as the quiet shopkeeper stand out most. The special effects are used sparingly but are very well done and show some great imagination. The creatures that come out of the mist are varied and interesting. There is a lot of talk about the ending of this film and I have to say I'm not really surprised; you'll either love it or hate but personally I found it to be a refreshing end to a commercial modern horror film. Overall, The Mist is an excellent horror film and can be considered a must see for anyone who is a fan of the genre!"

"da_lowdown","5","61","104","7 December 2007"," hope, despair, and that damned ending
","I'm not going to bother giving you a synopsis of this movie. The Stephen King novella has been out there for several years already. I urge you to read it. Should you just read the story and pass on the movie? Well, that depends on whether you should read more anyway, and whether you don't mind sitting through a pretty weak ending. But, more on that a little later.<br/><br/>Most of the original plot points and characters of the original story remain. The setup has been tightened, but at the slight expense of Norton's character development. The mist itself also does not receive the proper build up like in the short story. I love watching movies, but one of the medium's shortcomings is it's inability to get into your head, and characters head, the way literature does. I realize that books and movies are completely different mediums, and you shouldn't compare apples to oranges, but I digress.<br/><br/>What does remain is the building terror, hopelessness, and Lovecraft inspired people eaters. Mrs. Carmody's character receives more focus, but with good reason. Some folks may complain that it stereotypes, and slanders Christians. No, what it does is shine a light on religious fanatics, and their exploitation of people's fears and sense of despair. It attacks fanatics, not Christians. Got that? The same kind of fanatics that talk desperate young men and women into blowing themselves up along with other innocents, or drinking poisoned Cool-Aid in a South American jungle. Several of the characters passingly express their faith in God, but are not presented as lunatics. However, if you can see the Camrody character for what she really is, and what she represents, there is no need to feel offended. But if you took this character as a serious attack on your faith, maybe the shoe fits. Hmmmm. Oops, I digress again. Got ahead of myself.<br/><br/>Actually, one of the things I admired about this film was how well it presented this argument. Frightened, desperate people with no answers to mounting crisis (personal or otherwise) tend to flock to charismatic psychopaths that promise answers and solutions. This can happen to even the most 'normal' person under the right circumstance. Look at what happened in Jonestown, Heaven's Gate, Waco. 'The Mist' illustrated part of this dynamic pretty well. Marcia Gay Harden's performance is so effective, I almost denied her my praise. Some may call it overacting, but, have you ever heard a revivalist on a roll? <br/><br/>Another interesting point the film makes is how you can't expect that reason and logic alone will protect you or save your life. Like in the book, the Brent Norton character refuses to believe the dilemma they are in, simply because it doesn't fall in line with what he knows (or thinks he knows) about the world around us. In his mind, there is no need to fear something that makes no sense to you. If you can't see it, why fear it? This point of view costs him his life. And, at the other end of the spectrum, is Carmody, which I just discussed.<br/><br/>There are a couple of fine scenes of superbly executed terror. The pandemonium that breaks out during the first night when some of the creatures make it into the store, is simply amazing. The scene in the pharmacy had me almost in a fetal position in my chair. Well executed.<br/><br/>***** Major Spoiler Alert -I'm not kidding, turn back now!!!****** <br/><br/>Still with me? Okay, Sounds like I really liked this movie, so far. Right? Well folks, sometimes a game is decided in the final seconds. There's no way I can talk about this movie without talking about the ending. <br/><br/>First of all let me clarify my position on the cookie cutter, happy Hollywood endings that give closure and warm fuzzies to all. I abhor them. Some of my favorite classics do not have happy endings with complete closure: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, 2001 a Space Odyssey. A well crafted anti-ending should leave you with some kind of yearning, or maybe leave you reeling from 'punch in the gut' ending that challenges your intellect. I can see that they really tried for this, but they failed. Why? Well, it boils down to plausibility. You can get away with just about anything in your story telling, but your character's development and the story construct has to lead up to it. You have to convince your audience that their actions are plausible, no matter how outrageous. <br/><br/>Drayton popping bullets into everyone's head almost immediately after he runs out of gas is implausible because of his drive (and everyone else's) to survive just a few hours before. What?! You mean to tell me this guy's will to live turned on a dime that quickly? And no one in the car protested? How could Darabont have made the ending more plausible, thus more effective? How about watching (time lapse over days) them slowly run out of food, water, start to get sick. How about having them pinned down by those creatures for several days to the point that despair sets in. Then the ending would be plausible coming from these characters. And then watching their would be salvation roll in just a few seconds later would have made it even more poignant. Just another five minutes of film would have done it. But the way it was handled, it didn't feel natural, it felt forced and contrived. <br/><br/>I applaud Darabonts attempt at underscoring the importance of not losing hope. How falling into despair can lead to tragedy. If he had pulled it off, it would have been a true knock-out ending.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the ball got fumbled in the final seconds. Such a shame."

","This movie had no story line to it. I kept waiting for something terribly interesting to happen, but nothing did. In fact I found the story filled with nonsensical dead-end subplots that failed to tell anything. Like the whole stuff about it being the fault of the military. How was it their fault, how did they do what they did and how did they get these results. I was hardly impressed with the cheap theatrics and ""special effects"", in fact instead of horror, I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation and the acting of some of the performers.

But, as soon as the characters were stuck in the store, it quickly turned boring. It was a simple man vs. man scenario. You a got a couple of local hillbillies as dumb as rocks.

Well, they seem to avoid all the bugs, and drive until they run out of gas. Then, they all agree to commit suicide. The dad kills his kid, the woman, and the old couple. Pretty crappy ending. The movie was bad enough, then dad just offs everybody for no real reason. Come on... they go through all that trouble to survive, just to run out of gas and BANG BANG BANG BANG. Movie over. Guess there were 5 of them, but 4 bullets. Does Hollywood really think people want an ending like that? It was stupid, what I take as a simple shock stunt by the director. It was tasteless and was inconsistent with the movie and characters. And, lol, King liked the ending. I think he's going senile, his last few books kinda stunk.<br/><br/>Total waste of time.

"caithiseach","5","110","202","22 November 2007"," When the scary parts of a film make you laugh...
","Considering ""Shawshank"" and ""Green Mile"" turned out so well, I expected this superb King story to make a superb movie. I'm guessing that the reason for the delay in opening (moved from November 16 to November 21) was so Mr. King could have his cameo deleted so we wouldn't associate him with the film. That is a mere hypothesis, but it's as realistic as anything in this movie.<br/><br/>Logic issues beset this movie. The mist hangs immobile over the lake by the Drayton home, and there is time to take a leisurely drive into town. But when a panicky shopper runs for his pickup, the mist is rolling toward him so fast he can't get his door unlocked (as if people in Castle Rock lock their doors for a quick trip to the grocer's).<br/><br/>The guy who runs in screaming ""There's something in the mist!"" has a bloody nose from falling but no scratches on his chin and no damage to his clothing. Odd. There is no cell service, no land lines working, no electricity, but by golly the newspaper got printed with the whole Mist story. Was the press cranked by hand? And all those newsboys walked untouched through the mist to make their deliveries. Lucky guys.<br/><br/>Tell me, where did the store get a thousand bags of dog food when there was not much else stocked in the store? How did Jim's mouth stay bloody for two days when the crazy evangelical got smacked across the face, touched her mouth, showed her bloody fingers, yet had no blood anywhere on her face? How could the generator on the loading dock be overwhelmingly loud and smelly except when people talked? There's nothing wrong with having your characters yell over the sound of machinery.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that the poorly designed ""realistic"" touches might have been fine in a movie less serious about attempting to mimic reality. But bad continuity and everyday phenomena that just don't happen that way don't lead one to accept extraordinary phenomena very well.<br/><br/>How often does a lunatic talking in a grocery store get ten minutes to preach without being shut up by a circle of 20-30 onlookers? Almost every monologue (by any character) went uninterrupted for far longer than human nature would allow. Why? The screenplay had things these people needed to say. Way too Broadway and far too unrealistic for a ""real-life"" drama.<br/><br/>What did work well was the gruesome critters, though their scenes were often punctuated by bad dialogue, none of which I can recall other than ""I think we may be facing a serious situation here"" or something like that. The means used to hurt these creatures were often borrowed from ""Alien"" and other shows, so that was detrimental to the scenes as well, even if those methods were the best ways to destroy the beasts.<br/><br/>The ending...not tragic, because it showed a lot of stupidity on the part of a few characters. It turns out that ten more minutes of patience on their part would have been a healthy thing. The irony was far too trite.<br/><br/>There was a lot of silence in the film, no music until one key scene. By then, the music was jarring because of its prior absence. I would ditch it.<br/><br/>In sum, the offhanded ill-treatment of everyday life features became laughable and made what was in some other ways a meticulous film a hard story to dig into, a challenge to find frightening. Go see it, but don't expect to see much of the ultra-realistic King flavor in the actual realization of his excellent story. In fact, you won't see King at all."

","Spoilers ahead! OK, so it begins quite good, with the storm and the mist and everything looks promising. Then comes the tentacles. A little disappointing, but hey, wasn't expecting much in a S.K.-based movie. The big problem is that they looked like they easily could have broken that door but they didn't, and such a door does not close if something gets jammed under it (a safety issue). The different ""bugs"" and ""bats"" are just about tolerable as monsters, although not scary. Then all this religious crap starts. First of all people don't buy into this cultist-stuff just like that, at least not in one night. They will be busy surviving and scouting for threats rather than listening to some nut-case. Second, funny how religious people (read: always the Christians, after all this *is* small-town America, the part of USA that Hollywood just loves to hate) are always portrayed as whack-jobs, and small-town people are just easily misled hillbillies/rednecks while the great liberal artist from the big city is the ultimate good-guy and beacon of reason. The whole movie industry and their writers (obviously including Mr. King) just really like to bash those oh so dangerous Christians, huh?<br/><br/>And then there's the annoying ending. They could have gotten gas from other cars or from a pump before they ran out. One filling it up and another guarding with the gun. Anyone would EASILY risk that before running out. And IF they ran out they could wait for days. Eating a bullet is NOT something that becomes that tempting that quick. Besides, shooting two persons with one bullet is easily done at such close range. The improbabilities are just stacked on top of each other in a neverending pile. It would be no problem to make a better ending but noooo, they had to create a ""shocking/controversial"" and ultimately very UNENTERTAINING ending, making the whole movie null and void. The main character just gives up and SHOOT HIS OWN KID. Worst ending ever. The only good thing is I never paid to see this horse manure."

We enjoy horror because, at it's core, it's an escape. I admire the guts it took Frank D. to make the genre something more.<br/><br/>But he dropped the ball with the ending. Technically the movie is brilliant and well acted. It remains pretty close to the source material. (by Hollywood standards.) But at the end, Frank takes the scripting wheel from the King novella and drives it over a cliff. He has the most contrived and trite ending that is designed to jerk us emotionally. It makes you feel cheated. It's an ending just as bad as any cheesy feel-good sitcom ending. Only it's a tragic opus of coincidence. It's executed poorly, it's a depressed Michael Bay came out of the woodwork handle the last 10 minutes.<br/><br/>I don't need films to jerk negative emotions out of me.

","First of all let me say, I love Darabont, sometimes love King, and like Thomas Jane. When I first heard of the mist I was extremely excited. Great concept, great talent behind it, should be a great film. However, it fails on almost every level. The only positives that I can say about the film is the absolutely perfect cinematography, and the overall very decent acting. Some of it was over the top, but basically pretty good. Now on to the bad points of the film. First of all, the CGI looked TERRIBLE. I really mean that. It looks pre Jurrasic Park. Every time there is a digital creature, you can instantly tell its digital. Why not use practical effects? <br/><br/>Next, we have the terrible character development. I didn't truly care for any of the characters in the film, save for possibly Ollie, the cashier at the store. Characters with no prior screen time would show up, do something completely bizarre, and then basically disappear again with no building or explanation as to why they had done this. The only explanation given is their conversion to religious zealotry, but this happens so fast that it holds no weight. There is no real suspense, and overall, really bad dialog. Top it off with an ending that should have made me want to fall down and weep, yet only made me (and many others in the theater) laugh out loud. One of the most disappointing films I've seen in years. Too bad, considering the talent involved."
"brown945","9","96","183","16 December 2007"," Great movie where the characters actually have substance.
","It seems that Frank Darabont can do no wrong when faced with bringing Stephen King novels to the big screen. He masterfully directed The Green Mile as well as one of the greatest movies, if not the greatest -opinion of course-, film of all time, The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is not another gore fest slasher movie. Granted it has its fair share of gruesome violence, but it is the signature way in which King develops his characters and focuses on human nature and emotion that allows this movie to succeed. <br/><br/>Rather than focus on how the mist got to their town or what exactly it was, the story zeros in on how the people co-exist with one another in spite of occurrences which they cannot fathom nor know how to deal with the supernatural foe. It is a primitive story based on human weakness and King's eternal themes of hope and fear. Fear of not just what we don't know or what goes bump in the night, but fear of ourselves and what we are capable of doing to one another. <br/><br/>Religion is an important element in this story that any theology, history or philosophy student could write a thesis on. When faced with fear of death do you turn to god? Smoke and mirrors. With reference to Castro, who himself made such a spectacle at his speeches that Cubans themselves could believe he was the second coming. It is not religion that is the evil force in the film but the way in which men and women exploit it to make themselves stronger and breed their own hate, fear and insecurity -clearly not a new theme-.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was complex, entertaining and albeit depressing, I found it satisfying at points -those who have seen it know what I am talking about-. If only more films had more substance to them and had some kind message, even if the message was a bit muddled.

","*Thanks to a local radio station giving away free passes I was able to go to an advanced screening of SK's ""The Mist"" last night.<br/><br/>Let me be short & to the point; This film is GREAT!! ""The Mist"" makes Carpenter's ""The Fog"" look like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (& I'm a big fan of The Fog). The Mist is very true to SK's novella with an alternative ending thrown in that is THE most depressing cinematic ending since Disney's ""Old Yeller."" The characters are engaging & the critters that emerge from the mist are THE most disturbing & skin-crawling creations since Peter Jackson's King Kong crevice creatures(HP Lovecraft would be proud). There is a fair amount of blood & gore in the film but it's not over-done or over the top. Suspense & characterizations are where The Mist draws its true power from not SPFX (most of the critters are CGI but it's done fairly well). Overall, I had a BLAST with this film. Director Frank Darabont (who has directed The Shawshank Redemption & The Green Mile)has directed one for the books gang & a film not to be missed or put off till it comes to DVD.<br/><br/>BloodStone's recommendation: Do not miss The Mist.<br/><br/>BloodStone's rating 9.5 out of 10."
"Sojaw","1","52","96","29 April 2008"," Possibly the worst film I've ever seen
","This movie is simply awful. First of all, the premise of nasty creatures being spawned by careless scientific experiments is unoriginal to the point of being funny. Choose a random episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and there is an excellent chance that you will basically see this same movie with much more believable characters and a much less depressing ending.<br/><br/>The second problem is that the characters behave in bizarre ways that simply bear no resemblance to the ways that real people would behave in similar circumstances. Real disasters have a way of bringing out the best in people. Longtime enemies put their differences aside to help perfect strangers. Not so for the comically unrealistic characters in this film. These people seem to -- almost immediately -- lose virtually any connection with reality. Virtually any religious person immediately goes into ""kooky cult"" mode, concluding that (for example) human sacrifice is the way to appease God. Are we really to believe that most persons of faith would resort to killing children within hours of a disaster like this? Come on.<br/><br/>The ""hero"" spends most of the film trying to save people, particularly his young son. Given this, it is completely silly to imagine that he would simply take a gun and shoot his son dead as soon as the car stops working on the way out of town. Why is the car any less safe than the store that they started out in? They are clearly on a major road out of town -- there was no reason to think that their situation was truly hopeless. Therefore, there is no reason why they would suddenly agree to commit murder/suicide. This is particularly true in view of the fact that this group of people had been portrayed as rational and clear-headed up to this point.<br/><br/>The film desperately wants to say something about the frailty of human rationality but this theme has been explored countless times in much better ways. In this respect, this film is no better than any of the many 1950's style B-grade science fiction films that it inexplicably tries to emulate. Worse yet, the utterly unrealistic behavior of the characters causes the film to fail miserably to achieve even this goal. As a result, the ending is pointlessly sad. Instead of successfully telling us something about the frailty of human rationality, it simply leaves the viewer wondering why he just paid good money to watch people die.<br/><br/>That brings me to my third (and biggest) objection: I don't know why some filmmakers seem to think that a sad ending is fun to watch or artistic. Yes, I know that bad things happen in real life but I go to movies to ESCAPE the horrors of real life -- not to be reminded of them. A film like this can be a lot of fun if you get to watch the heroes overcoming seemingly impossible odds. It's fun to watch a triumph in the face of what seemed like certain disaster. When the good guys ultimately lose, however, a film like this amounts to nothing more than watching people suffer. That's not fun to watch."
"conedust","2","17","27","23 April 2008"," Barely Adequate Sci-Fi Horror
","What you have here is an old-fashioned survival horror movie in which ordinary citizens are pitted against giant squishy things from who knows where. A spooky mist rolls into town on an otherwise pleasant afternoon, and from it emerge tentacled horrors, trapping about 20 Mainers and vacationing summer people in a small supermarket. From there, they struggle, and that's the plot in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Because it's based rather faithfully on a Stephen King novella, at least as much emphasis is placed on interpersonal character dynamics as on the bug nasties from dimension 7. Unfortunately, however, none of it rings true. Everything about the film feels stagy and two-dimensional. This is probably the fault of director Frank Darabont, who never met a treacly character cliché he couldn't embrace fully. Meanwhile the invading beasties, while reasonably cool, aren't ever particularly frightening. Darabont is more concerned with mildly thrilling sci-fi action than with building suspense or delivering raw horror. Only in the film's final moments, when the true, Lovecraftian scale of the threat is finally revealed, do we really get a taste of anything genuinely dreadful.<br/><br/>Overall, The Mist feels, more than anything else, like a better-than-average Sci-Fi channel production. You get the same blocky staging, unconvincing sets and obvious exposition. The same cardboard characters running through their cardboard histrionics. The same hokey digital monsters (though, admittedly, executed on a bigger budget than cable TV could ever manage). The only really interesting thing about the movie was the amount of time spent on a subplot involving a messianic crazy woman and her destabilizing effect on our intrepid little band of would-be survivors. This subplot, unfortunately, plays out in just as ham-fisted and obvious a manner as the rest of the film, so what might have been a neat little philosophical puzzle is flattened into a shrill, anti-Christian tirade.<br/><br/>Despite it's many failings, The Mist's ending is its greatest sin. I'd have been perfectly happy if it had ended where King's story did, with our doomed heroes simply riding off into an unknown but unpromising future. Darabont, however, decided to wrap things up in a decidedly grim and Serling-esquire manner. I found the ""shocking"" conclusion insultingly overstated, out of character and borderline senseless. <br/><br/>1/10, but there is one fantastic effects shot towards the end (you'll know it when you see it)."
"ZachRomero","Null","3","3","4 April 2020"," One of my all time favorite horror films
","Frank Darabont returns to the Stephen King well once again and this one is my personal favorite. I have a soft spot for horror stories, I know The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are both much more subtle artistic masterpieces of modern cinema, I watch those films quite often and they tug at my heart strings each and every time. This film, however, is a fantastic character study with a subtly layered screenplay, powerful performances from it's ensemble of movie stars and ""hey it's that guy!"" character actors that also just so happens to include expertly directed gut wrenching sequences of horrorific monsters. It's a truly spooky film unlike most modern horror films. Darabont puts you right there in that supermarket, surrounded by panicked townsfolk and religious nutcases. Not only is the film scary, it's painfully tragic. I don't want to spoil the ending because it's so incredibly powerful so I'll say as little as I can but just don't expect every character that you've grown to love to make it out unscathed. This film has immense rewatchability unlike so many horror films that are meant to shock you momentarily with a jump scare then laugh it off with a quip. This is NOT that kind of film. Yes things get shocking but they're earned shocks and not just a series of the filmmakers shouting BOO!"

","There are plenty of posts out here saying ""It's great"" or ""It sucks"". I had heard good things so went into my viewing very positively. Unfortunately, I found this tedious and annoying. There were a few good moments but they were heavily unweighed by a bad script, bad acting, and bad effects. There is much less suspense than you would imagine in a thriller. But after some extremely wooden acting in the first ten minutes (""A tree fell on our house, oh well"") with a storm that looked milder than the three thunderstorms that passed here in the last two weeks, we get a quick succession of ridiculous scenes:<br/><br/>(1) A guy runs into a grocery store from some fog and yells ""Close the doors, there's something bad in the fog"". People do and suddenly the whole store is in terrified silence. Very realistic.<br/><br/>(2) In the storeroom, a redneck yells at the artist ""I'm tired of all your pretensions"" after about 30 seconds of dialog of which none is pretentious.<br/><br/>(3) The schoolteacher has a gun but they need someone who can shoot it and the second-rate clerk just happens to be state pistol champion. Oh yeah, don't even think about the three soldiers who are in the store as they probably don't know how to use a gun.<br/><br/>(4) A big city lawyer believes that four people are playing a joke on him in the middle of a crisis situation.<br/><br/>(5) You reason that you can probably make it next store to the pharmacy because the one guy who left made it about 200 feet before being horribly killed. But you forget about the stock boy who made it about 6 inches before being killed.<br/><br/>(6) A huge creature (which is never seen again) pounds and pounds on the heavy metal loading dock door when the entire front of the store could be entered in a second.<br/><br/>It goes on and on - just horrible. Never believable for a second and I don't mean the alien creatures, I mean the script for the behavior of the characters. If you enjoy good suspense or horror, avoid this. There is a 25 minute segment (starting about 60 minutes in) that has good action but the rest is bad. The ending has been thoroughly debated and whether you like it or not, it is totally obvious."
"Quinoa1984","8","75","150","21 November 2007"," a near-classic throwback to 1950s sci-fi movies, with an emphasis on cool, creepy monsters and a chillingly human atmosphere
","The Mist is one of the bleakest horror films to come out of Hollywood in many a moon, but with some points that can be taken. This isn't trash or torture-porn, but an expertly crafted piece of sci-fi/horror fiction that can only come from someone as bravely demented as Stephen King (or rather from what appears to be a bravely demented creativity that, of course, knows no bounds). But if you asked me who directed it had I not known Frank Darabont had, I wouldn't be able to say: this is far from the classically-stylized form of Shawshank and Green Mile, and instead resembles what is like a sci-fi channel movie of the week, only much better written and acted. In fact, it's more comparable to the most succinct and terrifying that 1950s sci-fi movies offered, where creepy (and I do mean creepy and gross) monsters and huge insects and things crawl all over and in the darkest places, but it's the human beings and how they react- and how society is reflected ten-fold in the reaction- that counts.<br/><br/>Truth be told, the actual plastics of the film are well-done; the monsters themselves, which are explained only for a moment as a throwaway by a frightened soldier who says this mist and the creatures that come from it are from another dimension and there's some sort of portal or other, are delightfully nasty. They're the kind of huge critters that might have had room in King Kong had PJ had even more time, with the form of an insect or a huge squid or a gigantic crab, can make the audience jump and laugh and yell at the screen. Plus there's the mist itself, which holds a kind of ""big-other"" quality, as is described by philosophers as this other entity that human beings just can't really completely grasp, even when it's staring them right in their faces (not quite as direct as in Boyle's Sunshine with the sun, but close enough), and if one wanted to read into it enough it's a kind of crafty, ingenious metaphor from King on the nature of fear, of terror completely unbound in the unknown, or the little that is known which when confronted (i.e. when they go out to the pharmacy) is about as startling as anything imaginable.<br/><br/>But on the side of substance, this is also a winner, maybe even more-so. There's not much doubt in my mind that Darabont, for all of his faithfulness to the original King text, enriched the material for present times with a classic example of rationalism vs. irrationalism. The premise is this: an out-of-towner (Thomas Jane) is in a small sea-side Maine town when after a heavy storm a mist starts to crawl over the town, and as he goes to the supermarket to get supplies, with practically everyone else in town getting things, the mist comes completely over, a man runs out ""there's something in the mist!"" he says, and the door slams shut. From there-on there's a struggle on the fronts of, simply, what to do: Jane just wants to know what they're up against, how to get to the cars, how to get the hell out; Andre Braugher's character, a lawyer, might be the most rational, thinks it's poppycock that anything is out there even after the encounter some of the men have with the tentacled creature at the loading dock; and Marcia Gay Harding, in one of the great examples of playing a one-note character so right, is a hardcore bible-thumper who riles up those inside of the supermarket to realize that the end of the world is coming ala Revelations, and that she- following not getting killed while standing still by one of the alien-bugs- is the wrath of God. It's the first time in a while have I seen an audience yell and cringe and laugh at how each major character meets their fate, no matter what the approach.<br/><br/>If it isn't quite Night of the Living Dead classic-status, it might be expected- hence the comparison to sci-fi channel movie-of-the-week status, in small part. It is clichéd with certain characters, archetypes, lots of hand-held camera-work, and a melodramatic musical accompaniment. But it's worth seeing on the big screen, if only for the audience-participation sake, and to take in all of that potent terror that is realized from the fronts of effective creature-feature and socio-political drama. And the ending, to be sure, save for Jane's over-the-top reaction, is bewildering, and I mean that as a compliment."

","sometimes you have to catch a film on a big screen, while it is still in movie theaters. ""The Mist"" is clearly in that category. I will be thinking about this scary, moving, smart, and original work for days. I would like to say nice job for the screenplay, and direction, to Frank Durabant. He obviously understands the genre, and how to keep an audience engaged for a few hours, in the dark. There really is not much more to say about ""The Mist."" The cast, lead by Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden, is brilliant. Some of the camera shots are amazing. The look of the supernatural creatures is stunning. The sound design in this film is creepy, and beautiful. The production design, art direction, is great. Every aspect of film making comes together here.<br/><br/>To summarize the story-in a small town in Main, VI, a man/David Drayton/and his son, join a big group of people hiding from supernatural creatures in a supermarket. These bug like creatures are brought to the town by a mist, which envelopes the town, and everyone there. I would describe ""The Mist"" as a cross between ""8 Legged Freaks,"" and ""War of the Worlds."" It is original, scary, dark, serious, smart, and moving.<br/><br/>I have one large problem, though. The ending, which I will not discuss in detail with my comments, is in my opinion to realistic. We go to the movies to escape reality, not to visit reality. However, please do not wait for this film to appear at the DVD store. You might miss out on the chance to get real close to your date, when you get scared and you want him or her to protect you.<br/><br/>In closing, I will be brief. Do not miss this film. Go. I am real happy I had the chance to see ""The Mist"" in a theater. My hope is that you all get that chance as well."

","There is a significant difference between a short story and a movie. An ending of a short story may prove to be a disaster in a film. And I think that's exactly what happens here.<br/><br/>A short story is not required to have a ""happy"" ending. In contrast, a theatrical film which expects a person to get out of their home, travel to the theater, and sit through two hours of cinema, had better have some kind of reward for the viewer. If not a classically happy ending, at least one which furnishes some kind of catharsis or resolution of themes brought up earlier in the film--a satisfying ending, if not a happy one.<br/><br/>This film fails miserably. The ending is unsatisfying, unhappy, and deeply depressing. Recall that earlier in the film, the question of euthanasia was raised and was firmly rejected. In the ending, there seems to be a change of heart. Why? The question does not need an explicit answer, but at least a hint of an explanation. Otherwise, the ending seems totally arbitrary (as it did here).<br/><br/>Beyond the euthanasia issue, the ending seemed extremely contrived. Rescue became available within a minute of the unfortunate killings? Oh, please. It's like deus ex machina, but one minute too late.<br/><br/>In sum, a basically unexplained enemy kills a lot of people in unpleasant ways. No one figures out how to fight back, and virtually everyone dies. The only difference in the deaths is that the bad people generally died first.<br/><br/>I always love Thomas Jane. He's so cute, and so intense, but is always a blank at conveying anything other than what's written in the lines.<br/><br/>If you love Thomas Jane or Stephen King, you may like this film. I can't say I hated it, but it was very unsatisfying."

I don't believe for a second that people start behaving irrational just because they are scared, it takes a lot more, e.g. panic, brainwash or other extremely strong influence for that to happen. This all leads to the worst part of the whole movie where the director decides that it is perfectly normal for a father to shoot his child (in a completely ""safe"" situation by the way), this action is so unbelievable it dropped my rating from maybe 3 to 1.

"freaky_dave","8","34","67","25 November 2007"," Very disturbing with a shocker of an ending that was surprising to say the least
","Based on Stephen King's short novel from his Skeleton Crew collection of stories, The Mist, as directed by Frank Darabont, follows Stephen King's story very closely and was a very good adaption. It was not the greatest King story brought to the screen, that would likely be the Shawshank Redemption by this same director and Carrie back in 1976 by Brian DePalma, but it does the job it set out to do with a twist on the original story's ending which will surprise a few and likely disappoint others. I kind of liked the ending a little, but I will not spoil it for anybody who will see it.<br/><br/>After a freak storm, which knocks out all power and phone lines and destroys some things, a strange Mist follows in it's wake. Looking at this Mist you would see that there is nothing normal about it. David Drayton (Thomas Jayne) takes his young son and a neighbor into town for supplies. During this time they hear sirens going off and see Military trucks driving passed. Soon after this, a man comes running into the store yelling that ""there's something in the mist"" and explains how something in the mist took his friend. People start to panic, and it is around this time that the mist sweeps into the parking lot and quickly envelops everything. The build up is perfect as the human element begins to break down slowly. The first creature is seen only by a few who are doubted at first, but then when some doubters decide to walk out into the mist for help, it is not long after before other people realize that there really is something out there, and it's more than just one thing, and these things are all bloodthirsty.<br/><br/>I loved the pacing of this film and the way Darabont ups the ante by showing us what happens to people when they no longer feel safe. You see the creatures are scary themselves, especially some nasty creatures in the next door pharmacy, but the behavior of mankind when not in control of their surroundings is much worse. Mrs. Carmody (in an over the top but excellent performance by Marcia Gay Harden) as the religious fanatic is quite effective, and the way she draws followers to her as things start spiraling out of control is utterly terrifying because it is likely the way many people would react in such circumstances.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part was pretty good, but there were times when I felt as if the actors were forcing it. Thomas Jayne has a scene or two like this, but otherwise he did pretty good as the lead. Besides Marcia Gay Harden, I was also impressed with Laurie Holden who played Amanda Dumfries, and Toby Jones who played the heroic Ollie. However there were a few scenes, mostly in the beginning, where the dialoque seemed a little hokey. For the most part this improved as the movie went on.<br/><br/>The special effects were quite effective as well. I was impressed with all of them, but the scene in the pharmacy next door was to me the scariest and queasiest of them all. I talked about it above already. Also, most of the creations in this movie would fit in any H.P. Lovecraft story. I believe that was where King got the inspiration for writing this story anyway.<br/><br/>Of course there are deaths, some will come as surprises and some you will know coming before they actually do. The gore factor is not over the top like in the Saw movies or Hostel. This is more a scary film then a gross out film, and I found it to be better then all the Saw and Hostel movies.<br/><br/>I will not discuss the ending much. It will come as a shocker, and like I stated earlier, some will be disappointed and some won't. I thought it was rather ballsy for a director, and I commend him for not leaving it ambiguous like the King story, which I felt was also good. That's all I have to say about the ending though.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is very effective and will have you thinking about it after you leave the theater. It's not up their with Alien, ALiens, The Exorcist, or Halloween (the original Carpenter version), but it comes close to matching 2005s The Descent as one of the better horror films to come out in the past couple of years. Enjoy it at your own risk."

Apart from all this, what I hated most was the religious stereotype. Enough with the crazy Christian characters. How many times are we going to see that cliché in horror films? As much as Hollywood would like the viewers to believe deeply religious people are deeply disturbed, this just is not so. How about this . . . throw some loony lefties in your films for a change?

Further, its the first time I've ever seen a King adaptation that actually gets the weird characters and dialogue right without seeming cheesy or over the top. All the religious fanaticism in his books doesn't really translate well to the screen, and neither does a lot of of his dialogue, so it was refreshing, as a sometimes fan, to see it all work for once. The concept, as well, was truly scary and there are some great jump out of your seat moments.<br/><br/>But, the thing is way too long, and it's too cinematic to really evoke a 1950's monster chiller horror film. And the O. Henry twist at the end is just really too much. As my 12 year old daughter said, it would have been a much better film with a cliché ending. Oh, I know there will be those who say that it was brave of an American film maker to do what he does (and no I'm not gonna spoil it beyond saying there's a twist), but I'll bet once the ""I can't believe he had the balls to do that"" shock wears off, no-one will care.

Having read the written version of ""The Mist"" in Stephen King's _Skeleton Crew_ and listened to the ZBS Foundation's audio dramatization, I was at first disappointed and then sickened by what Mr. Darabont did with the story. In all honesty, I believe that this was the first time that I've heard almost the entire audience (and the theatre was full) ""boo"" a film when the credits appeared. If you haven't read the book or heard the audio version of this story, I highly recommend either. I do not, however, recommend you pay to see this film. If you are determined to see it for yourself, then I recommend that you wait for the DVD. I would have been able to stomach wasting $1.50 on a rental than the $16.00 I paid for my wife and I to suffer through this film in the theatre. Moreover, there are no dazzling effects or incredible sounds in the theatrical release that you'd miss out on by waiting, and you can always turn your television off.<br/><br/>Since you don't know me, I really don't expect you to avoid the film just because I said to. I'll try to give you some concrete reasons without actually giving away the storyline now. The strongest reason to avoid this film is the pointless and rather twisted ending that Mr. Darabont decided to tack onto it. While I admit that Stephen King's original ending left me wanting more, this certainly was not it. I probably could have forgiven some of the other major shortcomings, such as the laughably obvious computer-generated tentacles and the horribly played Mrs. Carmody, were it not for the ridiculous ending. If you've never read (or heard) the story, then stop here. For those of you who know the storyline, here's why I call Darabont's work a gross mutilation of King's story. I was initially encouraged by the opening, as it depicted the character David Drayton working on a portrait that bore a striking resemblance to the gunslinger from King's ""Dark Tower"" anthology. This clever opening, however, turned out to be a prelude to a very disappointing film. Darabont raced through the initial part of the storyline, reducing the entire opening (prior to leaving for the store) to perhaps five or six lines of actual dialogue (that count includes Drayton's ""reconciliation"" with Norton). I initially thought that Darabont was trying to prevent the audience from connecting too strongly with Mrs. Drayton, but the ending eliminated that possibility rather quickly. The other major problem with the story prior to the ending was the aimless nature of Mrs. Carmody's religious fanaticism. I don't know whether to blame Marcia Harden for a virtually lifeless performance or Frank Darabont for writing her an impossible role. Wherever the fault lies, the product was a completely artificial character. She didn't appear crazy, scared or angry, just fake. This is particularly unfortunate, as Darabont turned Carmody's rants into an even more central part of the film than the original story. Harden's lifeless performance, however, pales in comparison to the ending of the film.<br/><br/>If you still want to see this film, and if you don't want to know how it ends, then stop here. As you know, the original ending is very open. David fails to reach his home because of a downed tree and (as described in the book) the survivors go to an abandoned hotel where David writes down everything that happened and the story ends. The reasons for the mist and the fate of Stephanie Drayton are left to the reader's imagination. Mr. Darabont, however, apparently decided that our imaginations weren't qualified to fill in these gaps. Shortly before the desperate run from the store, the one surviving soldier (there were three in the film) spills what he knows just before he is stabbed in the gut and thrown outside by Carmody's followers. Darabont evidently liked the ""extradimensional window"" theory the best, so that's what he went with. The escape from the supermarket was faithful, with Carmody meeting her demise at the hands of Ollie's competent marksmanship. The giant arthropod still appears, although the film version is much smaller (and much dumber looking) than the creature described in the book. In the trip to the Drayton household, however, there are no downed trees, and the audience is treated to a lovely scene where the Land Rover pulls up to Stephanie's dessicated corpse, which is inexplicably pasted to the side of the house (don't ask, because I really don't understand myself). Darabont takes the gore one step further however, when the Land Rover finally runs out of fuel (evidently, they didn't try to refill at a station or siphon from any of the several abandoned vehicles). After fighting to make it this far, everyone suddenly decides to give up at once. They saved Ollie's gun, but it only has four bullets. So, we get to watch (from outside the car) as David shoots his son, Amanda, and the two elderly folks in the back seat. He then jumps out of the car (with blood everywhere of course) in hopes of being killed quickly, only to find that the U.S. Military has effectively eliminated the creatures and is now driving truckloads of civilians out of the area (including the women who went to get her kids at the very beginning). Then came the credits, and the ""boos"" from the audience. As I said, I could have forgiven the other faults, but this ending was both needlessly violent and completely absurd. This is why I recommend you spare yourself the pain, and stick to the book or the very well-done audio dramatization."
"dcpulliam","1","39","80","9 April 2008"," Ending Utterly Destroys the Enterprise
","I read this novella, what, 20+ years ago, and its genius has never left me. I was thrilled to see it was to be made into a film. I didn't have the greatest expectations: monster movies are so difficult to pull off when the creatures must be featured so prominently. So I forgive some of the cheesy rubber looking beasts that invade our world as depicted in the film.<br/><br/>For most of the movie, I can say the sense of dread, foreboding, terror and helplessness is well maintained. And who can say how people would behave under such extraordinary stress and terror? That's part of the story's strength; you can't say the actions of the store patrons are not believable because you've no standard against which to measure it.<br/><br/>But, and I cannot state it any more plainly, the ending of the film is the absolute worst conceptual piece I have ever experienced. Not only is the emotional sledgehammer delivered in the final scene outrageous, the ""tragic"" formula, ironically, requires the assumption of the most ridiculous premises imaginable, far worse than anything else in the film. Are we really to buy off on the idea that they left the store at the exact time that would lead them to run out of gas on the exact road on the exact spot that if they had left 90 seconds later or chatted about what they were about to do a couple of minutes they would've been saved by an armed force suddenly and inexplicably able to exterminate the millions of killer-saurs that flooded thorough the dimension breach? Was it some kind of joke? Was it, ""You'd never buy off on them making it to safety, so take a bite off this!""???? It seemed like a cheap trick a Jr. high kid would try to pull off.<br/><br/>In the interest of full disclosure, I am the father of small children, and the final scene in the truck, with all its implications, is not of the kind to be undertaken so flippantly. I might have given this film 7 or more stars if Thomas Jane had simply raged into the mist to end it. The director's choice of closing is so callously conceived and preposterously delivered it completely ruined an otherwise fine horror movie."
"stokestack","4","18","33","22 November 2007"," Unbelievably bad
","It's hard to believe that this movie was directed by Frank Darabont of Shawshank Redemption. If I had been at this movie alone, I would've walked out 45 minutes in. Or an hour in. It didn't matter how much time I'd invested; I was willing to throw it away to save at least 15 minutes of my life.<br/><br/>You know which way Stephen King movies go: They're masterfully atmospheric, or they're cheeseball productions that should go direct to video. The first scene of this movie gave me the appropriate sinking feeling: Oh, it's going to be one of THOSE...<br/><br/>What's wrong here? Everything from editing and cinematography gaffes to poor storytelling. Characters explode into arguments for no reason; there is no build-up to give confrontations any legitimacy. But the biggest problem with the movie is the use of abject stupidity on the part of the characters to achieve ""tension"" or to drag out boring action so the timing of the scene ""works."" You've seen this kind of thing before: The main character sees and hears something pounding on a garage door, to the point where the door bulges inward several feet and threatens to give way. He returns to the others and reports that he ""heard something."" Like what? ""I don't know. A noise."" Of course, the others doubt him and scoff, but the guy never elaborates. Otherwise perfectly articulate, he just stammers and stutters and the ensuing argument consumes minute after minute of our precious time. YAAAAAWWN. The movie is rife with incidents like these, where people just stand mute and stare as someone else delivers the most boring and uncompelling oratory imaginable.<br/><br/>Even more tiresome are the minimum of three endless sermons given by the religious zealot trapped in the store. What a played out and hackneyed storyline: First merely tolerated, she eventually whips people up into religious fervor and turns them against the heroes. What a surprise! Pathetic. This kind of thing was done far better on Twilight Zone 45 years ago, and sewn up in less than half an hour. Here we get to watch the drivel unspool for almost two hours, with no surprises.<br/><br/>I could let bad special effects go, but bad cinematography needs to be called out. Zoom rears its ugly head as often as the creatures do in this movie, and the result is a effort that often looks like amateur hour. You don't need a treatise on why zoom sucks to notice that it creates a cheap, made-for-TV feel. In fact, made for TV in the '70s, because today's viewers expect higher production value. They don't get it here.<br/><br/>So is there any redemption in this effort? There's one scene where the heroes venture out into a different physical area, and it's not bad. And I respect the end, which isn't what one might expect. But beyond that, there's little recommend here."
"hello_goodbye_01","9","43","90","15 March 2008"," Intense and scary!
","This is a horror movie! Frank Darabont did a fantastic job making another classic. In my opinion, The Mist falls under one of the best Stephen King book-to-movie made films out yet. The movie is intense, it kept me on the edge of my seat through out the entire time! The film isn't clichéd either, it has some new formulas to it to spice the movie up and its a different treat your in for. It's scary and some-what realistic if compared to our lives and it makes yo think...""what if that happened?""... thought. Marcia Gay Harden is simply amazing and her portrayal of Mrs. Carmody, she plays the character with dept and darkness. One of the better movies, worth a watch!"
"jose_charrua_pires","10","41","86","19 March 2008"," I was surprised this movie wasn't in the Oscars.
","This film adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Mist"" is one of the best.Frank Darabont did it with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"". And now you say: ""- Those were not one of those classic horror movies..."" But with The Mist, Darabont reveals himself as a director that has no fear of the reaction of the audience or the critics. He did a good enough job with ""Shawshank"" and ""The Green Mile"" but none was as good as this film. Scary, profund, and with great acting (Marcia Gay Harden as ""Ms. Carmody"") I was surprised this movie wasn't in the Oscars. At least for best FX. And still I am sad because this film didn't received the hype that films like ""Cloverfield"" or ""I am Legend"" received. ""The Mist"" has everything that the others referred above hadn't: a masterpiece ending that makes it one of the best horror films of the year, good acting and excellent filming. (e.g.: the action sequences are filmed in a way that i never has seen before: a kinda of flash zooming.) With ""The Mist"" you feel like one of the people inside the store, trapped by monsters. Don't think this film is another one of those monster movies...it's NOT.It is a movie about the human race and what happens when our lives are at risk. But it has a lot of monsters too!! And in the end, I was gasping for air!"
"shadowsill","1","29","59","20 March 2008"," Not-so-subtle Anti-Christian Undertones
","Just a quick observation from a Christian perspective (anyone else can just ignore, it won't be relevant to you) -<br/><br/>The main antagonist in this is a devout Christian woman (she is slightly more villainous than the monsters from the mist that eat people). While there's nothing wrong with having a Christian villain (Shawshank Redemption did it well), there's a big difference between saying a particular Christian person is evil, and saying all Christians are evil, and this movie seems to lean towards the latter.<br/><br/>Some of the things that were particularly bothersome for me:<br/><br/><ul><li>Initially the sole Christian, she quickly creates a cult following of somewhere around 95% of the people trapped in the store.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Inference: Christians only turn to God in times of trouble, when it is convenient. Christians are fickle. Christians are easily swayed and irrational. <br/><br/><ul><li>She convinces the mob to throw a man ""to the beasts""</li></ul><br/><br/>The Inference: Christians are more interested in damning than saving.<br/><br/><ul><li>A man says she has convinced the crowd she is psychic, because she talks to God.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Inference: A direct conversation with God is not possible. Faith is a sign of a mental disorder.<br/><br/><ul><li>Early in the movie, before she has actually done or said anything evil, she is shown praying. The directing is such that the viewer is urged to think ""how weird"" or ""she must be crazy""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's actually quite a bit more but I think you get the idea.</li></ul><br/><br/>I tried throughout the movie to tell myself ""this is just one bad person, they are not trying to say anything about the Christian faith"", but the movie simply does not allow itself to be interpreted as such. By the end the Christians represent 95% of the store, and every one of them is bad (they are definitively supposed to be seen as Christians because they are quoting scripture and are called ""a congregation""). The non-Christians represent 5% of the store, and every one of them is good (and they are definitively supposed to be seen as non-Christians because of the things they say - ""We start dreaming up ways to kill one another. Why do you think we invented politics and religion?""). Every Christian bad, every non-Christian good? How else can we interpret that? The evilness of this woman is clearly meant to be seen as the evilness inside any religious person. She is not supposed to be evil in spite of being Christian, she is supposed to be evil -because of- being Christian.<br/><br/>Such a blatant attack on faith was unnecessary to the plot and could have been easily avoided. It ruined the movie for me. I'm not saying don't watch it, I'm not saying they did something morally wrong in making this movie, I'm just saying I don't think a very Christian person will be able to enjoy this movie much."

Unfortunately, modern civilization has not succeeded in giving its average people more than superficial perception of human nature or else. Thus the movie works for most. It directly addresses the average man's simple understanding of psychology, underlines it, confirms it. Whatever your joy of the movie, try not to take it seriously in its display of human psychology. It is just the standard Stephen-King-way of making stories interesting and exciting.

"katieblueloveswill","1","30","62","30 November 2007"," Quite possibly the worst movie in horror history? I think so.
","Steven King's ""The Mist"": Hard on the eyes and hard on the mind, plaguing you with this thought for many hours after you watch it: ""Did I actually pay to see that?"" Although I am holding firm on my opinion that this was quite possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen, I will give it the credit it deserves.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is considered one of Steven King's best short stories. I have never read the story, but after seeing this ""movie"", I doubt I ever will. I will give leeway to the skilled acting displayed throughout the film, for a horror movie, it was brought to life and very believable for me. It was, to me, along the lines of, ""I know this would never happen, but it seems to make a lot of sense, in a sick and demented way."" Sure, the thought of flesh-ripping bees and acid-shitting spiders may seem like a great movie to some, but if you're faint of stomach, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. I expected a freakish psychological thrill-ride, not a bunch of blood-craved super-demons ripping people in half and killing everybody. I expected the mist to be some sort of evil satanic gas or something. Not giant aliens as tall as the St. Louis arch.<br/><br/>We actually brought my sixteen-year-old sister Abbey to see this movie with us, and she will not TOUCH a movie if there is any sort of blood involved. So, as you can assume, when the first shot of the razor tentacles ripping open the boy's leg came onto the screen, Abbey was slightly... ""Unnerved"".<br/><br/>The rest of the movie got progressively worse, with more and more blood and flesh-ripping playing out. Now, I have no problem with some good gore-horror. Hostel is my favorite movie. But give me a break, if you're going to make a gory movie, don't give it a cool, bloodless preview. At least HINT to the future audience what they are in for.<br/><br/>The only enjoyable character is the crazy Christian bitch, because she holds the most enjoyable scene- watching her get shot en la cabesa.<br/><br/>And can you say WORST ending of all time? This movie has a terrible ending! I was sitting in my seat, laughing my head off for the whole ending credits, just saying out loud, ""I can not BELIEVE I actually paid money to see this! I could have seen 'Enchanted' and had a better time!"" So here's the down-low. If you're like me, and you enjoy a good horror with a good ending, (Not necessarily a HAPPY ending, but a good one), do not see this movie. If you are faint-of-stomach, stay away. But if you're different, and you enjoy any crappy movie with some cheap gore and suicide, feel free to waste your money."

I mean I thought the director of Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile(Great movies) could at least pull off mediocrity...WRONG. They should have called this movie The Punisher. Horrible CGI to Unrealistic everything, mixed with a burnout cast. At least films such a Battlefield Earth, Batman and Robin, and Tango and Cash have somewhat of a humorous feel.

"jtammyjas-1","2","20","39","25 November 2007"," Stephen King, Master of Clichés
","I finally realized that the King is Dead. I kept hoping that he might rise from the ashes and actually start writing scary stories again. After watching this crapdaptation of his novella, The Mist, I finally realized that he was never really that good to begin with. Literally, every character in this piece of garbage is a cliché. You have the strong, sensitive wasp artist type with his beautiful lakeside home and perfect wife and sensitive boy. Next, add the unbelievably dumb and intolerant hick local mechanic and the feisty old teacher (representing the secular, public employee sector) bemoaning how underfunded the schools are in their obviously wealthy community. What modern horror story would be complete without an unbelievably aggressive Christian fanatic to prey upon the weak minded? She was so over the top that I couldn't help but think that Mr. King was also on the soap box preaching to us about how we're supposed to hate anyone with deep religious convictions. I don't go to church myself, but I was actually offended, especially when the audience was goaded into applause when she was finally murdered by the humble, sensitive cashier. All of this cheap drama takes place in, of course, King's safe little Waspy town of Castle Rock. Maybe he should start a theme park...<br/><br/>The ending was COMPLETELY awful. Although the hero had, at one point, warned about leaving the grocery store before the evil religious nut turned the place into a Jonestown, he ends up doing a Jonestown at the end by killing everyone in the car for their own good. What was so imminent at that point? The giant bug had paid no attention to them; the spiders couldn't get in. Why not just wait? Talk about defeatism! What if the mother in Cujo had taken a similar tact when she was stuck in her old, hot car with her asthmatic boy with the rabid Saint Bernard waiting outside?! A more interesting tact in The Mist would have been for the hottie teacher to rescue the boy from his suicidal dad, have Dad chase her and then have the troops take him out before he catches them. Or not. The movie was still essentially boring BECAUSE WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT A BUNCH OF TRITE, Cliché CHARACTERS?<br/><br/>I gave the movie 2 stars for the fun monster bugs."

The truth of White-collar America being right!<br/><br/>This movie proves WE are not only the voice of reason but great artists as well and in touch with that adorable pop-culture. <br/><br/>Of course WE understand the danger of the situation first and with our course of high-school psychology we are in an enlightened position to tell people: ""It's all right to be scared."" We are not being condescending at all. We are truly concerned, because WE are better people after all.

"zink-paul","5","6","9","23 June 2015"," All the right elements, and yet
","First of all, let me say right up front that this is a very good movie. Not an AFI Top 100, but very good. And it ought to be, as it has all the right components: a seasoned writer/director with several outstanding films to his credit, notably ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption""; a super-solid cast; a good music score (except for the use of that annoying, vaguely Balkan/Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern wailing women chorus to signifying deep tragedy—please, give it a rest already), a depressing visual look suitable to the story, and workmanlike dialog.<br/><br/>Yet with all that, I gave it only a ""5"" score. Maybe a ""6"" would have been more appropriate but I deducted a point for no one having punched Marcia Gay Harden in the chops early on in the film (10 points credit to her acting for that). My fundamental disappointment with this movie is (1) that it somehow never became greater than the sum of its parts, and (2) it was predictable—even the controversial ending, to some extent, and the final final ending, absolutely.<br/><br/>Just as with sorority house slasher films, where you can reliably warn the cute blond NOT to open the door to the room in the attic, in ""The Mist"" you could generally finger which character was going to make it to the end alive or not, almost as soon as he or she was introduced in the story (spoiler alert: it's a horror movie, some people die). You can predict how many of the action sequences are going to play out, what the consequences of excess lighting will likely be, and which characters will rise to the occasion and which won't, (with one exception). In fact, my biggest surprise was a car starting promptly and driving off when needed, rather than the typical horror movie cliché of an endlessly grinding starter and/or tire stuck in the mud.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film did a quite good job of using the considerable acting strengths of the cast to deliver a fair amount of character development with relatively few lines of dialog. The pacing, though deliberate at times, was neither plodding nor frantic, and the unobtrusive and efficient cinematography let you focus on the story.<br/><br/>I'm happy that Stephen King found this film version of his book so frightening, but for me, the most chilling part of the movie was the frozen food section in the supermarket."
"billion_mucks","5","20","40","10 December 2007"," Mist, Haze, Fog...Watch out for Humans Better.
","What to say about ""The Mist""? It pretty much overwhelmed me. Yes, for its truly oppressive finale and it's tension moments. With disaster movies like these the script is divided somewhat into: 1) Society is shown functioning 2) Abnormal events presented 3) Society analyzes the situation 4) Society panics 5) Chaos.<br/><br/>Well, I repeat the word ""Society"" because of one thing. At one point, after the mysterious mist proclaims the entire city, some people are cornered into a supermarket. And there Frank Darabont plays an intense, insightful drawing of the human group, that it's powerfully engaging and smartly written. The voices of reason, common thinking and Christianity are promptly adjusted to the characters, and as tension and problems start accumulating so does the strain between the survivors. Fear not only the monsters, but the enemy within your lair...<br/><br/>I didn't like of the film the painfully hostile image it gives to the Christian people. It's leader, or ""vessel"" in the movie is a crazy woman, fanatic that seduces the survivor gathering into her apocalyptic, biblical disoriented theories. Mass follows this leader that gives all final power to God without logical retribution, but pure devotion. The mass is powerful, and the few left on reasoning and cold logic. The mass convicted, tries to hunt the left ones and blame them for the disaster. Sounds familiar? Yes, Nazism. Maybe Im rushing. I am not Christian, but I entirely respect the religion and didn't want to be raised and convinced of a premature hate to the religion because of one annoying character and a good scripting.<br/><br/>Stephen King wrote the book in which this movie is based. His knowledge on terror and human fear is so vast, and his control over those reading and viewing his books/films make the experience reliable. The ending, well, it's devastating. I liked the movie not only buying the intense tension, but for it's crude report on human mind, chaos and society's guidance."
"mytu02","1","20","40","25 November 2007"," What's in ""The Mist""? Mr. King's Hatred...
","I begin by confessing I am a long-time fan of Steven King's work. And while he has some lackluster stories over the years he generally succeeds at capturing the imagination and delivering a good story.<br/><br/>This story, ""The Mist"" marks an all-time low for Mr. King in my honest opinion. For while it is a well-known fact that whenever Mr. King features a religious person of any rank, they are usually some sort of Christian affiliation, and characterized in a most demeaning way. This, I have always been able to dismiss as Mr. King's childish way of striking out at those he holds in contempt. And too, it never before spoiled an otherwise good story.<br/><br/>This time however, Mr. king has degenerated from the simple cheap-shot, to full blown and RABID obsession. One of the main characters of the movie, and indeed one who nearly dominates the screen for much of the movie is a woman who is Steven's idea of a fanatical Christian, who spouts Scripture (out of context of course) and soon gains cultic control of the others. She then institutes her own twisted system of ""expiation"" via human sacrifice supposedly based on Biblical passages.<br/><br/>At this point, I ceased to enjoy the movie, and began to feel myself growing angry at Mr. King's twisted and hateful denigration of true Christianity. In short: It was the rant of a rabid, religious bigot named Steven King I was duped into paying for the privilege of witnessing. It truly was SHAMEFUL, and something I had hoped would be beneath even Mr. King... but apparently NOT.<br/><br/>When the self-styled ""prophetess/preacher"" woman was finally shot & killed, many in the audience applauded, others like myself muttered ""Thank God that's over."" I was simply relieved that Mr. King's hatefully conceived characterization was over; but I wonder how many in the audience actually identified with Mr. King's characterization, and were receiving some kind of vicarious gratification from seeing her killed? THAT, if anything is what made this movie ""scary"": It's a cleverly constructed propaganda hit-piece, and it's target is normal Christianity which looks nothing like the character he portrayed except in the minds of men like Steven King.<br/><br/>I recommend people save their money, and rather wait for it to come out on cable. In doing so you will be accomplishing two noteworthy things: (1) You will be sending a clear message to writers such as Mr. King in a language they all too well understand, i.e. - MONEY. And that message is - ""There are still lines of civil decency and respect YOU must maintain"" (2) It will save you the grief & anguish I felt at having wasted my money pandering to this man's display of hateful religious bigotry.<br/><br/>Regards."

","'The Mist' starts out well but will leave you literally angry that you were duped into wasting two hours of your life. This movie will leave you disgusted, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>I love horror films, despite the vast majority of them being generally sub-par when pitted against other genres. I will cheerfully forgive cheesy dialogue, tired clichés and wooden acting for the sake of just one good fright. I say all of this to put my review of 'The Mist' in some perspective: if it's even a little scary, I am easily pleased.<br/><br/>The Mist starts out pretty well - it's well acted, if formulaic, creature-feature stuff. The gore 'n' claw special effects are a little silly, but the storyline seems to promise better things to come.<br/><br/>There is nothing better to come. About halfway through the movie the plot devolves into an utterly ridiculous circus centered around the rantings of Marcia Gay Harden's religious lunatic. From there, it really goes downhill fast.<br/><br/>I will not include spoilers; suffice to say that the director suffers a significant lack of character. He sacrifices any redeeming elements of the film to indulge in some hokey, PC political point-scoring, which completely kills the movie. The final scene is as unbelievable as it is irritating - and it is really, really irritating.<br/><br/>To reiterate: 'The Mist' starts out well but will leave you literally angry that you were duped into wasting two hours of your life."

","The first hour was a snore, and then it just got dumber and dumber. The preaching lady was symbolic of Christian fundamentalists and really made fools of them. Only Christian-bashing is allowed these days. Imagine if it were the Koran they were mocking instead of the Bible. Stephen King would have to go into hiding like Salmon Rushdie did. The token Black was a total moron and an anarchist. He was so stupid that I could see Al Sharfton getting on his bandwagon about this one. Bring out his soapbox. How can Hollywood dare to bring back the stupid Black stereotype without complaints? The dialog was moronic and banal. The characters were so farcical that the audience was laughing at them and their lines. It was something to do, at least, because nothing was happening for the first hour. Then those stupid mechanical insects showed up. Kill them with burning mops! This movie was just so dumb that it really hurt to watch it. The Crawling Eye (1958) was much better. Only the last five minutes of The Mist is credible. That's all I'll say about that. If you think the good user comments about this film are real, you are in for a BIG disappointment.

"Crashunderride","1","15","29","22 May 2010"," I borrowed this DVD, and it feels like I should hurt the person who loaned it to me..
","I can think of a few choice words for this movie, but I'm sure most of them would be unappreciated on a public forum, so I'll refrain.<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of Mr. King, I have liked SOME of his work, but I've never liked his books as a whole. That being said I tried not to let that blind me to the movie, and it didn't, I disliked this movie but for many reasons entirely unrelated to King.<br/><br/>Instead I think I'll point out what upset me most about this movie, It's potential. I'm a huge fan of monster flicks, and this one was no exception. Or rather it wouldn't have been, if this were a Monster flick.<br/><br/>This movie had an oppressive atmosphere, a dark backdrop and a huge mysterious monster, these together should have made for a fantastic monster movie, or at the very least an entertaining one. Instead I was subjected to two hours of near uninterrupted boredom. The main problem was that there was nearly 0 monster, and you kept seeing different ones. First it's a tentacle, then its giant mosquito's, then 4 winged imps/bats, then spiders with acid web, thing incorporeal praying mantises...where does this end? Had the film picked a monster and stuck with it, I cant help but feel it would have been much better. Though if it had, it would have only marginally helped, the monsters looked like something I could pick up at my local hobby shop around Halloween, not scary or intimidating, they seemed silly, the only monster that interested me was the Mantis, because you barely see it, and it actually had an imposing presence.<br/><br/>The acting was poor, there are no two ways about that, It took me 20 minutes before I found a character who actually displayed emotion, and when they did I often felt they were 10 minutes too late. The attempt at shoe honing in social commentary was noticeable, you can have messages without hitting us over the head with it, but apparently the filmmakers thought they literally had to TELL US THE MORAL in order for us to get it. THe film does this on several occasions, and it's insulting each time.<br/><br/>The idea that being trapped and scared can bring out the worst in people is sound, it would be easy for people to seek help in such a situation, and as such I have no trouble believing that the one offering them salvation could sway the peoples ideals. But not in such a time, in less than 2 days these people go from decent, caring people, to raving lunatics who stab and sacrifice an innocent man, then attempt to do the same with a young boy. The worst part is, she's not even offering salvation, at no point does she say she can save them, only that this is judgement. I've read the bible, and the faithful are judged too.<br/><br/>The sticking point for many I saw was the ending, and I personally liked the ending, until IT'S ending. In the end the Main character SHoots his passengers, including his son, to spare them having to be maimed by the monsters that surround them, a noble gesture, as he is then forced to carry the weight of their deaths alone until he too is consumed by the beasts around them. Until he isn't, the army rolls in and saves the day, leaving him with nothing. WHY!? What would have been so wrong in having him wander to his death, why torture him that way? I was fine with the depressing ending, I like downer endings, breaks the monotony of all those films who wrap everything up in a neat little bow, but this was just painful, I didn't even LIKE this guy and I still felt like he was being punished unfairly.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The acting was wooden, the monster were silly, the story dragged in 1001 subplots that went no where, for no reason. Main story points were weak, paper thin even, camera work was shoddy, and this film contained a character who contends for the MOST ANNOYING person in recent cinema memory. There were the ingredients for greatness, unfortunately these ingredients were left to rot, and then they served us this."

The director managed to keep the audience on their toes throughout the movie. It doesn't contain much of scary moments. But this has pretty much everything; action, mystery, thriller, horror, science fiction, love, religion and a brilliant ending.

That's not the only problem, for two groups form inside the market, one in favour of escaping, the other for expiation!<br/><br/>As is the norm, King adaptations vary in quality and divisive fan appraisals, so with ""The Mist"" on screen not exactly setting the box office alight, and it even getting delayed releases in Europe, one would think this is one of the lesser King adapted lights? Not so! In fact, it is now proving to have a longevity of worth in horror fan circles. So much so, that the great horror writer at the literary source gives it the full thumbs up whilst giving the ""changed"" ending his full pat on the back approval.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont (director and adaptive writer) is of course the man who previously took King's more human interest stories and crafted much beloved movies out of them, so why was he in the chair to direct a film about alien creatures unleashing bloody dread on small town Americana? Well the answer is why ""The Mist"" is such a cunningly chilly delight. For this not only features monstrous creatures straight out of a Lovecraft/Barker nightmare, but also the monsters of the human kind, where the venality of the human condition is laid bare under duress - and it is frightening.<br/><br/>The alien creatures themselves creep the flesh, ok the effects work sometimes sags under the scrutiny of ""HD"" viewings, but this is nightmarish stuff, none more so than with a quite brilliant and terrifying sequence of events in a pharmacy. Yet it's the human monsters within the supermarket that usurps our creature invaders, where religious fervour and man's propensity for survival comes crashing together for dynamic results - the cast utterly in tune with the material and delivering quality portrayals.<br/><br/>Once the human battles within dissipates, and we come to the resolutions and reasonings of what has caused the creature invasion (hello subtext), we arrive at the much talked about finale. It actually deserves to be divisive, for we don't want yet another horror film finale that has people shrugging their respective shoulders and saying ""fair enough, but is that it?"". If you buy into the all round bleak tonalities that the pic has been serving throughout, then this ending hits all the right buttons. For sure, this is no easy cop out to send you home with a smile on your face, it's brutal, and crucially it's befitting the word of the genre it sits in - horror! 8.5/10"

If you're gonna review a movie, you shouldn't base it upon the ""general impression"" after having watched it, you should base it upon all the thoughts and emotions during each and every minute throughout the movie, and also consider the ""cinematographic"" aspects thereof.<br/><br/>See, it is a typical-apocalyptic-movie. Had it not been for the ending, I would grump for the waste of time about the rest of the movie which is, Let's say ""Hide 'n Seek"". You have a bunch of people surrounded in the mall trying to survive, limiting the entire environment of the movie to a certain mall. Then you have under- powered human beings trying to fight a supernatural prowess. The idea of the movie was pretty simple and anybody can come up with that, also with such plot, but there are a few points here and there which were subtle but valid, and the major point was : Don't mess with Mother Nature, I guess ?<br/><br/>At first, I thought it's a Christian-ish propaganda with that woman's shouting out biblical verses, but then, no, the plot changes. It also explained how primitively lunatic people can get when they are facing the apocalypse. I don't really know if this is exactly a horror movie, because I cannot count how many times I had jump-scares, I suppose only 1, more or less.<br/><br/>The bad thing is, I am used to such horror, and I have seen many things coming a few minutes before, only then did I know it was none other than an average plot.<br/><br/>The pros of this movie would be : The ending and the fine screenplay and script<br/><br/>The cons are too many to cite, I wish they had shortened the movie to 1h30mn instead of 2 hours, removing all the fruitless and underwhelming scenes. Also, the movie tried to build sympathy for people who die, but it didn't work out quite well.<br/><br/>You see, even the ending is flawed, I can't buy why the dude killed ""them"", including his kid... and then ""The Mist"" seems to be resolved and there, you got yourself trolled.

","Not being a huge fan of Stephen Kings work, I entered the cinema with little to no expectations - which was a good thing, as this movie only went to reassure me that the only thing worse than reading Stephen King is watching Stephen King.<br/><br/>The Mist can only be described as being some horrid combination of my three least favorite things - Stephen Kings brand of nonsensical and non believable ""horror"", an episode of Survivor, and an episode of Big Brother.<br/><br/>The film begins with what at first appears to be nothing more than your average run-of-the-mill storm. Heading into town to pick up some supplies, artist Dave Drayton and his son Billy eventually wind up in the local supermarket. Sadly, they remain in this setting for the majority of the remaining hour and a half making for some rather uninteresting scenery and camera work.<br/><br/>It isn't too soon before a mysterious ""mist"" engulfs the supermarket. Only after an elderly man whom bleeding profusely declares that ""there is something in the mist"" do the staff and customers lock themselves in the store in an feeble attempt to shield themselves from the ""horrors"" that await. These ""horrors"" come in the form of some cliché and unimaginative extraterrestrial insect-like creatures, which are comparable to those of A Bugs Life.<br/><br/>From this point onwards, the remainder of the film feels like some giant episode of reality television in the vein of Survivor or Big Brother, and the audience is subjected to watching a bunch of confined dimwits trying to overcome the challenge that is the ""mist"".<br/><br/>All of your favorite stereotypes are here - the redneck, the crazed religious person, the token black, the leather clad bikey, the acne ridden store assistant, and of course, our underdog hero which come in the form of Dave Drayton. Conflict ensures as personalities collide.<br/><br/>You would think that after our poor store assistant Norm is subjected to the harsh cruelties of the tentacles which emerge from the ""mist"" that the others would learn their lesson. Apparently not, and several other would-be heroes suffer a similar fate through random acts of stupidity.<br/><br/>Apart from spewing out over-sized insects, the ""mist"" also seems to sap IQ points from anyone it comes into contact with. This becomes increasingly obvious throughout the film, and climaxes when our store bound citizens conclude that a wall of dog food is an effective means of fending off hostile beings. Then again, do you really expect anything more intelligent from someone who uses an iMac such as our artist friend? <br/><br/>Tension mounts as religion crazed Mrs Carmody splinters the stores inhabitants into two factions through her seemingly never-ending religious babble. The audience is able to breathe a sigh of relief when she finally receives a bullet to her head, effectively putting an end to her unoriginal and uninspiring dialogue and mundane excuse of a subplot.<br/><br/>Eventually our hero Dave and a random selection of townspeople decide to make a break for it. Venturing into the ""mist"", they seek sanctuary in his car. However, it appears that the price of gas is too high for Dave and for whatever reason has decided not to top up today. Which is unfortunate, as it soon puts an end to any motorized escape.<br/><br/>After all hope seems lost comes the only sort of ""twist"" in the story - our hero Dave rather unheroically puts a bullet in the head of all the cars occupants - including his son. Finally (for reasons unexplained) the ""mist"" rather suddenly disappears and all is well and good - except for the fact our hero is now down one son, and I am down the price of admission to this sad excuse for a piece of ""horror""."

Best would be to spend no money and wait till MIST hits cable. You may be very glad you did."
"paradisemags","1","17","35","5 March 2008"," Movie ruined by ending
","I just saw this movie last night, and have to say I really hated the ending. But before we go further, let me explain:<br/><br/>First of all you had to have seen the film to understand everything stated bellow.<br/><br/>Despite what one may say about the rest of the film; bad soundtrack, some bad acting, unconvincing CGI, It is an excellent film. It does run kinda slow in some places, but overall it gets you VERY involved with the characters. It traps you and by the time you get to the face off between Ollie and Carmondy, You are pretty much emotionally involved, making this scene in particular a very climactic moment.<br/><br/>But the ending... Let me say I was really satisfied with the film. It seemed that for the first time I would see a movie where the US army or superman or some other half ass-ed force would NOT save the day. Finally it was the end of the world and no one could do ANYTHING about it. Had the ending stayed faithful to the Novella, the film would have been a truly innovating and excellent story. I would have seen it again and probably had bought it on DVD. It would have been right up there with Shawshank and Green Mile as good Darabont stuff. But the ending to this film is just disgusting and morbid. While it IS innovative and shocking, it just isn't satisfying. It makes me feel like I just WASTED 2 hours of my time, it was something I could have done without. <br/><br/>Darabont is an excellent director, he is a true artist. But that is what makes the ending to this flick an even bigger insult. I, for example, am a painter. I can paint a person and make it look like a photograph. I'm THAT good. but what if I were to use all my skill to paint a little girl getting raped? or a little boy being mutilated? Even if the paintings were done with superb technique they would still be trash! That is what Darabont did to us with this film. He used all his skill to create a disgusting, awful film ending. It was dismal and unrewarding in every sense. I don't pay good money to leave the theater in a bad mood! the damn thing was just BAD because the ending destroys it! Period!"

","A ridiculous premise is made worse by unrealistic reactions and made for TV special effects.<br/><br/>The premise: A gateway to another dimension has been opened by the military (as they do), unleashing a fog filled with mutant creatures (although we only see glimpses of latex tentacles and cgi insects). The reaction: The residents hold up in a grocery store with only plate glass windows as protection.Constant warnings of dangers are ignored, a religious fanatic is allowed to start a rebellion, and the finale is so bad it made me angry. Despite 2 hours of harrowing ordeals the ""hero"" makes a ridiculous decision at a time of relatively low threat, making himself responsible for the only truly awful event of the movie."

","I read the story over 20 years ago. I waited that long for what I thought would be a good adaption. Instead, I was given a film with a sufficiently rewritten ending that the entire point of the story was changed. Sometimes this works Without giving anything away, in the original ""Poltergiest"" it's as if Steven Spielberg has put the film to rest and told Tobe Hooper to wrap it because he was going home. The last 15 minutes of the film are some of the best horror ever done. In Spielberg's version of Kubrick's ""A.I."" you can tell where Stanley would have ended the movie, and where Spielberg HAD to tack on a cute ending. In ""The Mist"", Darabount is given one of King's best stories and changes the entire point. Want to see what I mean? Read the book. then see the movie. Then cringe in disgust."
"indigoazure","1","16","33","28 November 2007"," Another Garbage Film (may contain spoilers)
","This is just one more in a long list of bad movies made in the past 10 years. Who noticed the writers were on strike when they've been on strike for the past 10 years? <br/><br/>This movie had all the reflections of a psychopathic society. The overly religious woman was exactly like the religious idiot in Silent Hill and tons of other movies with one dimensional characters.<br/><br/>Actually every character in this movie besides the little short guy with the gun was one dimensional and worn out. I felt he had a little more to him because he came across as sincere, made a real effort to live, and had a skill that was unexpected. I imagine that most of the people who like this movie are young people who didn't grow up during times of great movies.<br/><br/>And the end? Talk about no ability to problem solve. My thoughts are ""why are all the characters in movies, cavemen these days?"" I mean, western culture is always pumping up the ""superiority of man"" and yet western art reflects a species who barely try to survive tragedy and usually don't. I wonder how we ever made it this far being as weak as people are in films these day. But more importantly as weak as writers imagine people to be. <br/><br/>I mean really... can't figure out a solution? ... kill yourself. Can't make sense of the situation? ... kill other people. Scared to die? .... Get delusional.<br/><br/>What? Who raised these people? Oh I forgot, it's just a movie, but wait... someone wrote it.<br/><br/>I'm also sick of not being able to watch a thriller or horror movie anymore without religion being thrown in. It is starting to feel like an brainwashing attempt. I knew this movie was over as soon as the woman started spouting a bunch of religious messages and people were actually listening to her and letting her continue. <br/><br/>I thought about commenting on the things in the ""mist"" but they were just too stupid for me to waste time on. Seems like they were really only there anyway, to lure you into a religious brainwashing session.<br/><br/>I found myself desperately wanting to watch a movie, skipping past the religious monologues to get to the ""meat"" of what was really happening and wanting for those people to make a real effort to survive.... Never happened."
"f-hentschel","2","11","21","20 January 2008"," How much stupidity is possible?
","This movie deserves two stars (rather than just one) because of three reasons: first, there are two or three jokes in the dialogues that are obviously funny by intention; second, the makers came close to a strong ending before falling back into the cheap pseudo-moralistic vein of their narrative; third and most of all, the screenplay which certainly is one of the worst I ever saw, manages to be so messed up that I almost enjoyed myself (sadly, though, in the second half of the movie get's lightly better so that it isn't even funny anymore).<br/><br/>Obviously, the idea was to develop a kind of drama among the people in the supermarket. However, this would have demanded a screenplay much more thought-out than this one. The positions as presented in the movie couldn't have been more unconvincing and simple-minded. The screenwriters might have learned a lot by reading Jean-Paul Sartres Huis clos (or even by watching The Blair Witch Project).<br/><br/>And by the way, if anybody wants to teach me a lesson in morals, he or she should first study the relevant texts by Aristotle, Petrus Abaelardus, Thomas Aquinas, Voltaire, Immanuel Kant and others. In this movie there is only mindlessness and stupidity. How far, far away are masterpieces like Night of the Living Dead, the (original) Texas Chainsaw Massacre or even Hitchcock's Birds that unmistakably served as a model for this unworthy successor."

"eggflip66","6","15","31","9 March 2008"," B-grade cinema called and want their movie back!
","CGI or no CGI. It felt like a mix of b-grade and even c-grade with a small dose of Hollywood. I am a movie buff. I watch a lot of movies. I watch many movies daily, and I like to think I have good taste when it comes to any movie of any genre whether it be a drama or a horror like this one.<br/><br/>Now I'll get to the point. I try to keep an open mind even with all movies, even the blatantly bad ones or even the films I don't really personally like, as I can admit when they are well filmed or acted brilliantly regardless of my opinion on the actual plot, like No Country and There Will Be Blood for example. Those movies I hated but I can respect them for their brilliant acting and work of camera and hidden themes etc. The Mist on the other hand, well let's just say I'd have more respect for a 10 dollar hooker with a yeast infection. I can at least say I didn't waste my money on this rubbish movie. But that being said, now there's 2 hours of my life I want back.<br/><br/>The acting is so unforgivably bad and a lot of their lines are so incredibly uncredible you can just never get attached to any character as everything everyone in this movie just felt contrived. I mean sure, you wouldn't come across a situation like this in real life, but I refuse to believe that's how people would act if a monster in the mist actually ever did appear in my town. How can citizens be so dumb? So putting the sub par acting aside, I'll forgive Thomas Jane just once for choosing a bad movie because I honestly believe it was mostly the scripts fault here and not so much the actors. I'm not even going to go into how bad the CGI is because I don't want to get attacked by people who will try to tell me you don't need good cgi to enjoy a movie. I am aware of this fact, but I still have to say that in today's world of technology how is it possible for a Hollywood blockbuster to have such incredibly lame CGI? Oh and the ending of this movie just made me want to punch my friend in the face for making me sit through the whole thing.<br/><br/>What more is there to say really? Except to wonder over how the rating for this weak movie obtained a score over 7 on IMDb when it should be less than 5. I have a feeling it has to do with the fact Stephen King lent his name to this abomination and come on, we all know a Steven King fan is not a reputable source as a movie critic. So unfortunately there are an abundance of King fans out there and who will rate anything he has done highly just because they can.<br/><br/>Comparing to the last monster movie I'd seen this year, Cloverfield was rubbish but even that had more cinematic qualities going for it than this waste of a motion picture. In the end I recommend seeing the Fog, 1980 John Carpenter classic. Now that is what a horror movie is supposed to do. Scare you, not make you laugh and cry for the wrong reasons. In The Mist I was laughing at the monster moments and crying during most of the dialog. It really was that bad and right up there with the Fog remake from 2005 only somehow less scary.<br/><br/>B-grade movie enthusiasts however will probably think this is somehow the greatest movie they have ever seen in their whole lives."

","Ever since I read The Mist (1980), I've been waiting for the movie. I just knew this time it would be great - that they (the producers) would finally get one of SK's stories right. After 30 minutes into the movie, I wanted to walk out (son persuaded me to stay until the bitter end) - frankly, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen!!! No, I take that back - The Blob is the worst movie I've ever seen and The Mist rates right behind it!! I could not believe my eyes!! None of the characters portrayed in the movie were believable and didn't seemed to match the characters in the novella (except for Marcia Gay Harden's Mrs. Carmody - she got that right!). How could they get it so wrong?!! I bet Stephen King is embarrassed. There was only one good special effect towards the end that was worthwhile (the giant walking monster) AND they changed the ending!!! The ending is not the same as in the book and in my opinion, the movie ending was depressing!! My disappointment is overwhelming as I've been an SK fan since 1974. The only reason I can think that The Mist has gotten such excellent reviews is because most young people today (teens, 20's, 30's) have not seen the old B Horror Flicks that I grew up with. You know, The Bad Seed, The Birds, The Crawling Eye, etc. The mutant insects/animals were right out of a bad B Horror flick - I was so disgusted. There was no imagination whatsoever in bringing SK's mutants to life. No suspense. It was just dumb, dumb, dumb. Wait til it comes out on DVD. ....sigh.... The only SK movie that has been done right is The Shining with Jack Nicholson - at least that movie was believable and had me on the edge of my seat. The Mist made me want to run screaming down the aisle tearing my hair out!!! God forbid if they ever get ahold of The Gunslinger!"

","""The Mist"" rivals ""Dreamcatcher"" as the least scary, most unimaginative and rehashed Stephen King adaption ever, which is somewhat shocking considering both movies were directed by Oscar-nominated directors. But perhaps their credibility is actually the problem here (not to mention Stephen King's crusty imagination)--maybe these directors simply can't direct Horror, which is a genre that must necessarily forgo melodramatic pretension in favor of more visceral storytelling. It doesn't help that the melodrama itself sucks, cluttered with cookie-cutter characters spouting utterly phony dialogue and making inexplicable decisions seemingly for the convenience of the plot. If the movie delivered scares, the melodrama might be forgivable, but failing at both is inexcusable. <br/><br/>Look, just because Stephen King lies about retiring and continues to churn out crappy pseudo-horror stories, doesn't mean every single one has to made into a crappy movie simply to cash in on his reputation. I mean, ""The Mist"" is totally devoid of anything original, thrilling, or the least bit creepy. The ""mist"" in the movie is more or less just fog, which makes it hard for the characters to see. I, for one, find it hard to see why Frank Darabont or any of the actors wanted to be involved in this film, which (to be frank) has got to be the low-point of all their careers so far.<br/><br/>There is nothing sinister, supernatural, or creepy about the ""mist"" itself. The movie alludes to some trite symbolic significance, and tries to unnerve with crude portrayals of religious fanaticism, but to my utmost disappointment, the threatening element was not ""mist-ical"" at all. Believe it or not, it was....GIANT MAN-EATING BUGS!!!! OH MY GOD!!! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
"fedor8","Null","12","24","12 March 2009"," ""This pathetic attempt at a joke has gone far enough"". I totally agree with the black lawyer.
","Stephen King is the Ed Wood of the Modern Movie Age.<br/><br/>In German ""Mist"" means ""s**t"", and who are we to argue about the prophetic nature of Germanic languages? This pile of Stephenkingsian crap is yet another amalgamation of ultra-clichés that we've seen about 1000 movies, except that it actually manages to be a notch dumber than even the most cretinous 50s B-movies. I take it back: Stephen King is not the Ed Wood of anything - for that would be insulting even to Ed Wood's ""talents"". Rather, he is the Paris Hilton of the horror genre: deluded, dirt-dumb, perpetually grinning, and adored for all the wrong reasons (non-reasons), i.e. a major cult figure in an age of rising stupidity. Forget Eco or Asimov: it's only King's moronic scribbles that the riff-raff can truly appreciate.<br/><br/>SK doesn't even try anymore, if he even ever tried at all: he's been repeating himself for decades, but almost no-one seems to care. His novels/movies are like pop music: God forbid there should be a hint of originality in there somewhere, occasionally: his fanatically devoted, low-IQ fans would run away from him like the plague if that were ever to happen. TM doesn't omit any clichés: a small town being besieged by monsters, an unconvincing over-the-top religious nut, the survivors bickering over nothing, large insects, silly large spiders, the bad bad military experiments, etc. What's worse, this laughable malarkey-feast lasts a good two hours - which is about 90 minutes too long considering how unoriginal, retarded and thin its story-line is. Time is being wasted on totally irrelevant, dull scenes which SK probably throws into the ""character development"" category. The problem is that King's grasp of human behaviour is child-like at best... There is more character development in a bird-dropping.<br/><br/>At first, no-one wants to leave the store, not even to help a woman find her kid. (At the end we find out that she survived. No explanation whatsoever is given as to how she might have achieved this impossible feat: it goes against all logic - the ""logic"" that King himself established in this confused mess of a movie.) Yet, only a while later, a sizeable group of people are raring to go outside. Idiotic. This illogical group is lead by a black lawyer who refuses to believe the story of Squidy's attack. We all know what (defense) lawyers are, but they're not imbeciles; at least not as dumb as Stephen King himself. (Particularly hard to achieve.) So what does our ""bright"" hero, Thomas Jane, do to convince the lawyer? He does not show him the bloodied shirt. He does not tell him that a young man was dragged off and killed by Squidy. He just says ""you must believe me"". Idiotic.<br/><br/>The sole purpose of King's characters bickering retardedly is just so King can have his precious ""conflict"": that magic word in movie la-la-land. Conflict at any price. Conflict that will make you laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Ed Wood's hilariously inept plea for acceptance of transvestitism is peanuts compared to King's sorry attempts to pepper-up his horror stories with ""relevant social/political messages"". This dumb little monster movie makes mention of abortion, stem-cell research, education funding (King the Education Expert), military spending (King the Foreign Policy Maestro), and even Fidel Castro! (No doubt a friend of King's.) It's a major movie disease in recent years (only second to nepotism): no genre seems to be safe anymore from the simplistic preachings of semi-educated ""know-it-alls"" who don't realize their infantile (mis)understanding of the world's problems don't amount to a hill of beans. Besides, Steve, if you're gonna preach, then don't sandwich your idiotic/twisted morality and Leftist political messages between Squidy the Large Man-Killer and mosquitoes that suck blood: it just makes you look even more foolish...<br/><br/>Oh yeah, Steve, you forgot to mention gay rights, flag-burning, welfare reform, and health care funding. But I guess we'll have to seek Stephen's brilliant opinions on these issues in his other books/movies. What a shame... I was so looking forward to learning everything there was to know about the political and social climate of today's America, from an intellectual of King's calibre. What a mind, what class.<br/><br/>What an ending! I disagree with the pervading view that it's depressing: I think it's HILARIOUS. King writes about people as if he's only joined the human race yesterday, from planet Gamma X Retard.<br/><br/>What nonsense: 1) After the soldier gets stabbed THREE times with a large kitchen knife - in the belly - he is then thrown out of the store, but instead of falling to the ground he walks around as if he'd been scratched by a nail-polisher! 2) There is a burn victim (the way he gets burnt is an unintentionally comedic highlight in itself), but there are no pain-killers at all in this entire store, just aspirin. However, the store has enough dog-food to feed half of Brazil... 3) People are extremely frightened of the ""mist"" from the very start, and in normal circumstances half of America's population believes in alien abductions and Sasqwatch - and yet(i) everyone is suddenly skeptical that Squidy really can exist! 4) The speed with which the survivors are ready to accept Harden as Christ's prophet is ludicrous: yet more evidence of King's laughable lack of understanding of humans and society. (He must have obtained all his ""rich world knowledge"" from watching ""Oprah"" and Bugs Bunny cartoons.) <br/><br/>I loved it when King spoke through the old lady: ""too many bombs, too little spent on education"", she says early on. Is Stephen referring to the kind of ""education"" his cretinous books and movies serve in enriching and improving America's peanut-butter culture?"

","I will be the first person to admit that I patiently waited for this film to make its way into the theater. Although I have never read the novella by Stephen King, for which the film is based, I've heard enough about the story from friends to anticipate a masterpiece. What could go wrong? Frank Darabont, Mr. Shawshank himself, was in the director's chair. Instead of great film like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, Mr. Darabont has delivered what is perhaps the biggest turkey of the year. Being a horror fan for nearly 40 years, I can't remember when I've walked out of a theater with such disappointment. The religious references that pervade this film are so overwhelming, as to cause nausea. I felt like I was being preached to at every corner. Understandably, Marcia Gay Harden's character is supposed to be portrayed as some whacked out religious zealot, and even that portrayal I can overlook, for her performance, along with Thomas Jane, is the only good thing in this film, for their acting is superior. But, when I watch a film, the last impression that I want to be left with, is a feeling that if the characters only had more faith, perhaps their deaths (at the hands of Thomas Janes character)could have been avoidable. The use of a hymn-like score chiming in just as Jane's character anguishes about the lives he just snuffed out, is plain ridiculous. Plus, after all of the time spent trying to flee the supermarket and remain alive, why would these characters be in such a rush to end their existence so quickly? This ending betrays the very nature of the characters that we have been led to care about. I understand that Stephen King approved this change in the ending. Shame on you Stephen. All in all, 1 out of 10."

","First off, my favorite sub-genre in horror is the Monster/Creature genre. So when I saw the tentacles grab the dude in the preview I was all excited. ""Alright, The Host and now this. Fantastic."" Well, sh!t. This movie let me down in almost all facets. The story goes like this: Gigantic electrical storm. Next day the mysterious mist is noticed, but no one is concerned. Main characters head to Food Store to pick up supplies etc. There they run into a man with a bloody nose who said an acquaintance was just taken by something in the mist. Some nice scenes take place pretty early on including the generator scene and some nice Mist rolling over the surrounding area. Bang, suddenly the movie hits a gear that was just incredibly unappealing. <br/><br/>There are zero scares, unless you count the cheap scares; loud noises, scares you see coming a mile away but are made to make you jump no matter what. For a movie that revolves around Mist and not knowing what's out there, and realizing how low it reads on the Tension-meter, is astounding. But instead of focusing on the creatures and the mist, they have to add the evil human characters. That entire sub-plot was a draining part of the story. I just didn't care in the slightest what she was saying, how people were reacting to her or anything. Just completely useless in my book. Show me the big creatures, give me some serious suspense, show me some blood! Well, you don't get much of it, and probably half of the blood you see is human caused. Weak. Besides the story being a letdown, there were also many others aspects I disliked. The characters overall were very unlikable, most likely because they were just cliché, been there done that stuff. Come on now, they had a elderly lady used for comic relief! Thanks but no thanks, if I wanna see that I'll watch some cartoons. You've got another character, who stole the show acting wise, playing the bagger. But guess what, he's the most intelligent one in the store, not to mention he won states in a target shooting contest. See where I'm going? It's like that.<br/><br/>I don't want to complain all day about the CGI, or the lack of scares, or the lack of creatures (again, bugs and flying things we've all seen before) but it's so damn tough not to. I was incredibly letdown, and if you're a serious fan of horror, you should see this flick as nothing special. It's just a completely average affair. But for a wide-ranging audience, I think it'll fit the bill. Nice job Hollywood you did it again! When creature movies are done wrong, they're done very wrong. I think I'll pop in The Thing later on.....now that will deliver everything this movie lacked. And the funny thing is, in the beginning of the movie, you see a painting of The Thing."

I was not prepared, however, for the ridiculous plot structure followed by a complete meltdown of the main characters. I don't want to give away any of the plot details for those who have not seen it, and actually, I'd prefer not to have to remember the story any longer than it takes to finish this post. Let me just say that some carefully constructed and seemingly reasonable characters suddenly forget their own basic nature and behave in an arbitrary way just to satisfy a Stephen King-Frank Darabont urge to play a tasteless joke on the audience. This may work in short prose fiction, but not in expensive trip to the movie theater for an overblown mixed genre artistic mess."

At first you think maybe it's intended to be a parody of the genre, because it is so terribly written and acted, but then it all gets even worse and you're half-way through the worst film you've ever seen. If you need specifics, well then you've missed the point of this review. IT IS A WARNING, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! Rather than listing the films flaws, it would be easier to list its merits. It has none. At all. Perhaps if you have less than a college education, you MIGHT be able to stomach it...but I find that unlikely.

The atmosphere created for us was not one of scared desperation and defeat, but one of annoying, dense individuals, which led us to simply not really care what happened to them.<br/><br/>The ending when it came, was I suppose meant to leave the watcher with a sense of shock and disbelief, it certainly did that for us but not in the way I think it was intended to.<br/><br/>I did not get sucked into this movie, which I tend to do with most, I felt as though I was constantly on the outside of this film, watching with an ever increasing critical eye."

","...one stinker of a film. <br/><br/>I think Darabont should have kept working on the script for another couple of years because the first half of the film is almost unwatchable. Cutting out almost all the material from the beginning of the novella (the wife gets about 3 lines of dialog), David and his son and neighbor get to the store about 6 minutes into the movie and then the mist comes. There was no time to care about David Drayton or his son...or his wife...and there's certainly nothing throughout the duration of the film to make me care about him. Thomas Jane, who I thought would be pretty good in this, was bland as eggshell white paint. Andre Braugher is all wrong for the annoying neighbor role but then again most of his dialog is awful to begin with. Marcia Gay Harden tries to bring a Tammy Faye Baker spin on Mrs. Carmody...and it works for a little bit but, boy, it gets really old really fast. In fact, a lot of Darabont's buddies (Jeffrey DeMunn and Bill Sadler and the like) return in supporting roles and they're just not good. Only Frances Sternhagen as Mrs. Reppler feels right in her shoes. The camera work is pretty awful. I saw the boom in at least 10 shots...and the film was being shown in the correct ratio 1:85...nice! The build-up to the tentacle attack plays just as poorly as it did in the novella, and the tentacles look like Playstation 1 graphics. It's so incredibly bad. However, things pick up in the second half with the bug and pharmacy scenes. Those 2 sequences are really good...but they're too little too late. Don't get me started on the new ending. First, since Drayton's wife was in 2 scenes and had about 3 horrible lines (maybe other scenes were cut for time...or more importantly because she couldn't act), I really didn't care if she lived or died. Second, the shocking new ending is just as awful as people feared. I heard about it...thought it was interesting at first...but it's just so against the grain of the underlying theme of hope...AND it's pathetically short-sighted. Nobody thought about the gas running out? They couldn't have looked for a gas station? They couldn't have tried to jump into another vehicle at some point ? I was with my parents who were liking the movie a lot more than me and after the shock-ending came my mom turned to me and said, ""That ending was really dumb."" Amen, mom. Amen."

","When it comes to adapting written works of Stephen King to the big screen nobody has enjoyed greater success than Frank Darabont. In 1994 he parlayed King's The Shawshank Redemption into a score of Oscar nominations, and repeated the feat with 1999's The Green Mile. King has even gone so far as to anoint Darabont as the filmmaker he trusts most to faithfully render his work into movies. As such it should come as no surprise that his visioning of King's 1980 novella The Mist is about as faithful as a movie can be to the source material, but in this case that's not always a good thing.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with King's story, the movie recounts the events resulting from the aftermath of a severe thunderstorm that hits a small Maine town, which finds itself enveloped shortly thereafter in a dense mist that brings with it a horde of mysterious and deadly creatures. Townsfolk gathered at a local supermarket to stock up on supplies to get them through what at first seems like little more than a prolonged power outage, find themselves barricaded within as the creature concealing fog rolls in. From there the story alternates between the shoppers trying to survive against the various carnivorous entities that have them under siege, and the interpersonal drama that takes hold as a religious zealot in their midst does her utmost to convert the survivors into her own version of Jonestown, and it's on this component of the story that the movie stumbles  though not fatally.<br/><br/>If there was one facet of King's story that screamed out for re-work, it was the sub-plot involving the bible thumping Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) which rang hollow in the novella, and doesn't fare any better here. While it's understandable that in a story populated with archetypes there's a need for foils to provide narrative momentum, choosing a religious nut-case as the vehicle is about as unconvincing as having some white haired nutty professor pop up in a lab coat shouting ""it's alive"". Don't worry, that doesn't happen. Fortunately, both Darabont's screenplay, and King's story upon which it is based, have the good sense to forward the plot at a quick enough pace so as not to allow things to become bogged down in a stereotypically bogus anti-religious tirade which, at times, flirts with seriously derailing this movie.<br/><br/>Eschewing leading actors and instead opting for character players, The Mist doesn't disappoint when it comes to acting and effects, both of which are of high caliber. Devotees of King's original story may find themselves taken aback by Darabont's decision to pen a decisive ending to the tale, rather than the open-ended conclusion chosen by King, however in an e-mail to the director after reviewing Darabont's ending, King gave it his unequivocal endorsement saying if he had thought it up at the time, he would have used it.<br/><br/>It's rare to find a creature-feature that actually delivers when it comes to fear factor, however The Mist is a wonderful throwback to those movies that scared the jeepers out of us as kids, and had us sleeping with the lights on, and a chair propped up against the closet door.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont can safely add yet another successful Stephen King adaptation to his list, even though it's safe to say there won't be any Oscar nominations headed his way over this. One can only wonder what their next collaboration will yield."
"christopher1960","6","11","22","23 November 2007"," Mostly faithful to book, but character development and ending disappoint.
","Having read the story and listened to the unabridged audio many times, this film version leaves me flat. Character development of David, especially the removal of the narrative style of the story in the book, hollows-out the characters, leaving the relationship of David and Amanda out altogether (which had been one of the best parts of the story). The death of Norm portion in the loading dock/storeroom was especially faithful to the story, however, and shines as the best portion of the film. The suspense of the scene is carried off well as is the pharmacy scene. Yet again, the book makes the pharmacy seem to have been a smaller store than depicted with the addition of the MP death by baby spiders scene being wholly gratuitous. The race to David's truck was nicely carried out, with the reverses well played. It surprised me that the screenplay author felt it necessary to leave out the faint hope of Stephanie Drayton yet being alive by the return to the Drayton's house and the discovery of her body there. A constant in the plot had been of David visualizing Stephanie working in the garden as he had left her on that first morning. This was a source of guilt on David's part because of the developing relationship with Amanda. But, the most galling portion was the murderous end of the movie! This was a complete opposite to the book, which had the survivors holed-up in a hotel some distance from their hometown at the end of the novella. A feeling of hope was given in the book, whereas the movie left one with a feeling of pointlessness, especially when the woman who had gone to find her children early in the movie turned up alive and well with her kids. When the book had her as one of the first to die. Overall, a movie that showed promise at first, but leaves a lot to be desired at the end. SK's books are always a lot better than the movies accredited to them."

Rating 9/10
Positive Points: Since everyone loves bringing up the ending all the time, I'll discuss that first. The ending is depressing and makes you challenge your morality and decision making. During the entire movie, you completely agree with the protagonist. He makes every rational move, given his situation. You always feel like you would do what he does, which ultimately comes to bite you in the ass in the ending. The acting is a perfect mix of 50's camp and modern realism. The film is basically what 50's horror was trying to be and it's executed perfectly. The film has a cool threat and the themes and morals are engaging, thought provoking, and challenging. The Christian lady is annoying as hell, but she's SUPPOSED to be annoying. You're supposed to hate her. I'm sick of people giving this movie bad reviews because it's making them feel the emotions it's trying to make them feel. The Christian lady is supposed to annoy you and the ending is supposed to depress you.
Negative Points: The effects aren't that good, even for the time, but they're serviceable for the story. The movie isn't about the effects however, it's more about the story so this is a minor complaint.
Final Verdict: Overall, an amazing and impactful film that isn't afraid to take risks and challenge its audience.

","The Mist is a very interesting film that is based off of the genius that is Stephen King. Throughout the movie, I laughed, cried and was grossed out. I loved the idea of the creatures coming through the mist and I loved the setting of the supermarket, which hasn't been seen too much in other scary films. The bugs were kind of nasty, but were played out in the movie in very different ways. They were kind of corny and some of the deaths were just laughable. I also cried at the end, a very sad ending for some of the people after the truth of the mist comes to light. There are many emotions to the film, but it's solid enough entertainment that's worth a watch. I'm also a big fan of Marcia Gay Harden, she is an amazing actress in everything that she's in.

"michaeljharvey","6","12","25","4 June 2008"," Pretty good, as far as Stephen King adaptations go
","Let's be honest, Stephen King stories have not had very good luck when it comes to big screen adaptations. For every ""The Shining"", there have been 10 terrible movies. I was pretty leery about seeing ""The Mist"". I had enjoyed the novella and I wanted to see something that would do it justice. This film does a pretty good job, although I'm not sure it deserves its current lofty rating here on IMDb.<br/><br/>The plot is rather simple. A mixed group of survivors are trapped in a supermarket as a mysterious, deadly mist suddenly rolls in. No one is really sure where it came from, although theories abound. Some think it's the end of the world, Biblical style. Others think it's an industrial accident. Still others are convinced this has something to do with the research being done at a nearby military base. Very quickly the survivors learn there are weird monstrosities lurking in the mist. Creepy, prehistoric predatory creatures. They also quickly learn that any trip into the mist usually results in a gruesome death within minutes. There is no communication with the outside world, so the survivors are left to speculate how far the mist has spread and if any one else has survived.<br/><br/>Over time tensions begin to get the better of the survivors and civility breaks down. Some turn to a religious zealot for answers, others look to our hero, David Drayton (played by Thomas Jane), others simply commit suicide. At this point, the movie becomes more of a disaster movie with some movie-monster special effects thrown in. It's a study of how quickly society can break down when the normal routine and rules are removed. The movie also raises interesting questions about making decisive, life-changing decisions when it's hard to have a clue what the right answer might be. Do you stay in the supermarket, with an increasingly violent group of people, and hope help is on the way? Or do you try to formulate an escape plan and risk the mist, where no one has survived for more than a few hundred feet?<br/><br/>The psychological aspect of the mist is what's truly scary and isn't explored nearly enough. The actual monsters in the mist aren't all that frightening. Giant spiders, giant lobsters, giant insects, pterodactyl-like flying creatures... They all seem like rejects from a bad science fiction B-movie. The ""military research gone wrong"" angle also fits nicely with B-movie tradition and seems a little tired and ridiculous. The movie is far more enjoyable as a disaster movie, rather than a horror movie.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is surprisingly downbeat and nihilistic. What if our hero, who seemed so confident and in control all along, was just guessing like everyone else? What if he made some disastrously bad decisions, through no fault of his own? That's the end of this film. It seems the cowardly people, who were afraid to take action, are the ones who probably survived. All along we are so focused on the character flaws of the supporting characters, we fail to see that perhaps the hero might be just as flawed."
"Misfitfiend1989","1","12","25","19 April 2008"," The biggest load of dross I have ever encountered
","I am utterly disgraced that this film seemingly made the top ten most viewed rentals in the US. This film is in no way original, and at some points was utterly impossible to watch. I found myself not wanting to hear the characters bleating on about God and there seemingly small town problems and skip ahead to the parts where it seemed there was some remote action.<br/><br/>From the minute go I wondered why another ""creature the mist"" film was being made. Though I do realise this is based on a novel by Stephen King. The director could have at least picked one that was remotely interesting.<br/><br/>I think the only good thing in the film was the ending. I mean when the credits appeared on screen. The final sequence of this film was appalling, and totally unrealistic. Where the hell did all those emergency services come from. When the characters had been running around in the mist for the past hour and a half, only to see an ecosystem that was mysteriously found through a ""stargate"" type portal.

","There are a few important warnings I have about this film. It's incredibly violent and at times pretty gross...so exercise caution before watching it. Additionally, the character Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) will likely offend many religious people. <br/><br/>The story is set in a New England town. A weird mist descends on the village and a group of people are trapped inside a grocery store. When a teen tries running from the store to get help, he's torn apart by a multi-tentacled monster....but only a few people see this happen. A Some of the rest of them don't believe the story about the tentacle monster in the mist and make a run for it...and disappear. Soon, regardless of whether the rest of them believe or not, they believe SOMETHING god-awful has occurred....and gigantic evil bugs begin attacking. And, it only gets worse...thanks to human nature which takes an awful situation and makes it so much worse....including a weirdo religious nut who VERY quickly (too quickly) develops a cult-like following. What's next? It only gets much worser!<br/><br/>I like the angle about human nature tearing the group of people apart...this is the best aspect of the movie in my opinion. However, a few of the characters (particularly the amazingly unsubtle Mrs. Carmody) are ridiculous and over-the-top. Subtle, it sure isn't! Additionally, after a while I simply got tired of seeing the violence and ugliness...especially since it goes on for more than two hours. I must admit, this is NOT the sort of picture I normally watch....and it's very likely others might enjoy (?) the film more than I did. Thoroughly unpleasant, albeit a bit thought-provoking when it comes to folks reactions to the menaces."

","This movie delivers a longer lasting terror than is expected from it after watching the trailers. Apart from the conventional graphical demons, the movie builds over a wonderful story with a well chosen cast. The original script is based on the novel by Stephen King, but has been modified by the director/writer Frank Darabont. A young artist David Drayton(Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) are trapped in a supermarket with a group of other terrified people, when an alien/demon attack unleashes on the city. But the movie catches attention when this fear forces these people to turn against each other. This movie also delivers a comment on human nature, human relationships and their impact on the decisions they make. Even though the basic idea of a monster attack on city is clichéd, but the movie wraps it with some very creative writing, and thrilling story telling. I would rate the movie as a 'Good Watch'."

A small group of survivors are trapped in the local grocery store and in there they try to wait out the freak storm that has enveloped their town but slowly and surely with all civility out the window, they all begin to turn against one another.<br/><br/>LOOK UP horror movie in the dictionary and you would probably find a poster of this film.

","I never thought I'd say I'm glad I didn't go to the theatre to see The Mist. I just didn't get the chance, and in retrospect, it's a good thing. I didn't even rent it when it first came out - I held out 'til I found a copy of the 2-disc special edition with the Black & White version and actually bought it, sight unseen.<br/><br/>I watched that version with my friend Jordan the other night. Beautiful cinematography, well lit (he must have shot it with both versions in mind), and solid, if not great, acting. The pacing is perfect, the special effects are great, the thrills and chills do not really disappoint.<br/><br/>So why the low rating, you ask? Simply put: the script is bad. It's not that it sucks like a piece of Sci-Fi Channel one-word-title garbage, but nonetheless, it's very weak. Predominately in the characterization department. I didn't care about a single character in the film, mainly because I didn't get the chance to *like* them. At all. I want to *care* about the characters who are about to get skewered by a giant crab, but...nope, it's not there at all.<br/><br/>Oh, the acting is fine, it's not great, but it's decent enough. Thomas Jane doesn't have much to do, neither does Laurie Holden or, most woefully, Andre Braugher. They do the best with what little they're handed.<br/><br/>No, the fault is in Darabont's script. And man, I never thought I'd say that. Not after he wrote the screenplays for The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. Both of those have a depth of characterization that's almost unparalleled in film history. And yes, I know The Mist is just a ""cheap horror film."" I'm not saying it has to be as deep as Shawshank. But I wanted *something*. Lack of characterization. That's flaw #1.<br/><br/>The second major flaw is with Marcia Gay Harden's character. Now, I've resigned myself to Hollywood's love for the ""Religious Right Nutjob"" character. I don't enjoy it, but I've come to accept it as a trope. Here, though, it's simple abominable. The most over-the-top, heavy-handed, beat-you-in-the-face portrayal of that stereotype I've ever seen. It wasn't just bad, it was *forced*, and it failed utterly. My friend and I sat through the thing wishing that this supposedly-""Christian"" character would die the most awful death possible. Jeez. Frank, give me a break, will you? The third, and fatal flaw is this: the ending. I haven't read the novella, but I do know it doesn't end quite like this, and while I applaud Darabont's attempt to provide more closure for the audience... It's just so bloody wrong. I was tracking with it until the last 90 seconds or so. And those 90 seconds ruined the entire film.<br/><br/>Now, I'm a cynic who does not believe that humans are inherently good, and I'm fine if everyone dies in a film (not saying that happens here). I also appreciate a good dose of healthy nihilism in my movies. But how *this*... Good fracking grief, it's just too much. Take the depressing ending of Spielberg's film A.I., multiply it by a factor of 10, and you might get close to the way this ends.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont, what were you thinking? Like I said, I'm down with nihilism, but this is just too much of an extreme about face from the redemptive worldview of The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. There's a level on which it works, but... Good God, this is just too much. I felt like I had my guts wrenched out with a serrated backhoe. I can't believe I enjoyed Cloverfield and The Fog remake more.<br/><br/>The final verdict: What could have been a great horror film was made merely ""alright"" by a lackluster script, which was in turn completely ruined by a truly abysmal ending."

Along their way, they see a heavy mist and later, military convoys, police and firefighter trucks, ambulances heading toward it.

The problem is, nothing is really good or even great about this movie, either: <br/><br/>Rarely did I feel true suspense during these 2 hours, most of the time it felt somewhat empty. The obvious ""comment on human nature"" does work out somewhat, at least I really disliked the ""preacher"" character. Other than that the ""comment"" is one done at least a dozen times, and half of the time better than in this movie. Furthermore the movie failed to capture me in any significant way, perhaps mostly due to the dialogs, which sometimes seemed really stupid or incoherent. Overall it was an ""okay"" 2 hours to spend, but I've definitely seen far better movies than this one and somehow I regret seeing this one even more than a really really awful movie, because it just left me ""empty"": nothing to feel good or think about and nothing to be really angry about."

If I had it to do over again, I'd watch the movie, but I'd spend $1 and rent it on DVD.<br/><br/>My wife and I went to see this instead of ""Beowulf"", or ""No Country for Old Men"" Thomas Jane gave a good performance, as did Marcia Gay Harden.<br/><br/>By the way, my wife disagrees with me, she liked the movie."

","I have read Stephen King's novela about The Mist, and the ending, ruined the whole point of the story....because in the book, David Drayton discovers that the creatures cannot see you but only smell you so in the truck they are safe, and after they escaped the Supermarket, he drives for a long time, in nothing BUT MIST and monsters, until he comes to a hotel....and this is HIS story, which he leaves behind, for anyone that may find it in the future, while his son, Amanda, and the old couple sleep, he write's this ALL down, With their future being unsure, but braving the odds, they move forward, into The Mist. <br/><br/>The ending in the movie is SO wrong and unfair to a wonderful story of courage which with the original ending would have equaled it to some other GREAT movies like ""The Green Mile"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption"". <br/><br/>But if you want to have an extremely tragic ending for a change, why not watch Carry, at least the director stuck to the story...... This tragic ending in ""The Mist"" was not in good taste AT ALL.<br/><br/>It sure does not compare to other great King movies like ""The Shining's 1997 version"" or ""The Stand"" or even ""Storm of the Century""<br/><br/>I love thrillers and Horrors, and when I saw this movie came out I so wanted to see it, but when I did, I was so angry and very disappointed, I felt cheated for my money, take it from me DO leave 10 minutes before the end, cause the end is NOT worth it and if you are part of the majority, you will be angry too.<br/><br/>They could have done SO much better with this movie if only they had taken their time, the next movie they do on the King's stories, perhaps they should take more time and put more effort into it, and not make it look like a rush job, READ THE NOVELA ""What happen Mr. Director, were you almost over budget? is that why you did not put the proper ending to this story?

"roddenii","3","9","18","26 November 2007"," Darabont Destroyed a Chance at a Classic
","I cannot understand why folks equate a horrible ending with a Horror movie. Nor can I understand why anyone would believe changing the ending of a classic Stephen King sci-fi/horror adventure like The Mist makes it better. Especially since the film was doing wonderfully till the ""surprise ending"", which went completely, and ludicrously, against David Drayton's character. I enjoy well made apocalyptic horror movies; the Descent was fantastic (original cut); remake of Dawn of the Dead; the original Night of the Living Dead, etc, lets go on forever. But the original The Mist, which I've read many times, and listened to in 3-D audio, was a classic open-ended adventure story, with elements of horror. I had a lot of hopes for this movie. Like many King fans, I've been waiting for the original story to be made into a film since I first read it in 1983. It had a great, every-person's hero in David Drayton, and Thomas Jane was perfect to play the part. I loved the atmosphere, and I marveled at how well Darabont was getting the original story down tight as I watched it. I knew in my head how it had to end, because I've seen it in my head over and over again over the years. A muted hope for he and his son.<br/><br/>When the last five minutes began (and I knew nothing about a last act change suggested by Darabont), I kept thinking, no way. He is not going to do this. It makes no sense at all. It's not artistic, it's just ignorant, hackneyed story-telling, a ""surprise"" ending simply to disturb people. But he did it. Sure enough. Spoiled a perfect movie experience by going for a sucker punch to the gut. You bet it's startling. You bet it's cold. You bet it's horrible. And you can bet that if Stephen King had tried to sell that ending to a publisher 27 years ago, they would've sent it back post-haste. Why? Because David Drayton's character showed absolutely no prior indication during the story of having this fatalistic flaw. No foreshadowing whatsoever. From the word go in the novella and in the film, David is a caring, compassionate, and brave human. As a father of two, I can tell you that he would've sat there in the front seat of that SUV with his child until they were all so weak from thirst and hunger that he would've been barely able to lift his head, let alone the pistol. It is more logical, given his character, that he would have made some attempt at freedom. He would've reasoned that suicide was the very last choice. Not come to a stop and then within five minutes blow everyone's brains out. And it is very unlikely that all four adults would be on the same page when it came to the end-all solution the movie portrayed. I'm pretty certain the feisty old lady in the back seat would have shot a spray can full of flames in David's face before she let herself be killed.<br/><br/>So here was a chance at having a B-horror/sci-fi modern classic on the same par perhaps as The Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Quatermas X-periment, only to have it end on a false and hopeless note.<br/><br/>So for those of us who are disgusted with having waited over a quarter of a century for this story to be made into a big screen film, the same existential joke Darabont played on David Drayton, he played on us. It's over. Too late to go back. Never should've put our faith in a Hollywood director who thinks cheap, low blows make for good endings. What a drag."

The Mist is horribly outdated in Stephen King's style and thoughts--it is shot in a reality-TV format That even sports fade outs where chapters or commercial stops should Be. No one wants to genuinely freak-out or repulse the audience Anymore . . . at least in The Mist's attack in the generator area. The Audience was laughing more than anything else. It was a shame. I hope The gunslinger Dark Tower will not be shot in the same way even though Stephen King favors low standard reality-TV entertainment and sold the Dark Tower's rights to the makers of Lost for 19 dollars at a Convention in New Jersey--the guy was painting a Gunslinger poster Before the storm hit, and the Aesop's Fable moral of the story is . . . . wait!

"rbruckner","6","22","54","13 January 2008"," Could be worse, but not much
","Well, i saw this movie last weak in a sneak preview, and was really surprised it had such a good rating (especially because it seemed that everybody in the cinema hated this movie). At first, the idea behind the story isn't that bad, but in my opinion too much inspired by dawn of the dead and half-life. Some people are trapped in a supermarket and threatened by an unknown power from the outside. It could have been a really haunting movie about a group of people in an extreme situation, with some suspense added by the supernatural powers from the outside, and somehow it really tries to be this movie. But there are 2 big reasons, why this doesn't work:<br/><br/>1.) Most of the characters act too stereotyped, and after some dialogs you think: ""Did he really say *this*"", and thereafter: ""Yes he had to, he's the classical hillbilly/snob/leader/whatever"". You're getting either annoyed by the stereotypes, or you have to laugh about them. So you can't take the movie seriously anymore, which destroys the whole atmosphere the setting could have constructed.<br/><br/>2.) There's an religious fanatic, and you are hating her after she said two sentences. And the director let her do several monologues about several minutes, which are that annoying that they really keep you from enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>So i gave this only 2 stars. It was technically well done, but i would strongly recommend to watch dawn of the dead instead of this one (the remake), because the situation is quite similar and the people act much more realistic."

","I just got done watching this, and I must say that I am impressed. King's story has actually been expanded on in a way that enhances it, instead of just ripping it to shreds for a few more bucks. The interplay between the characters was very well done, and it felt authentic. Some viewers have taken offense to the way a religious person was portrayed here, and her actions upon the rest of the group. Unlike some, I know that this was a MOVIE, not a smear campaign. One could call their ability to tell fact from fiction into question, but we'll let that go for now. As it stands, this was hugely entertaining, and a great cross-section of humanity in crisis. I actually like the ending, as it forces you to see the true face of Horror. (No, it's not the Giant Walker. It's human failure.) Definitely worth buying, but I would wait until the special set comes out, if there is one."

That's about all there is to this movie. Oh, except for the tagged on ""Oh, crap! what have I done!"" ending.<br/><br/>Typically, for most modern horror/science-fiction films, there is no imagination involved in this production. Tension between the clichéd characters is noticeably forced, the strategic choices made by this group of dunderheads would have a group of baboons howling with laughter, and you could find better monsters in the pages of old comic books like ""Tales to Astonish"". Come on, toothed tentacles, big hornets, pterodactyloids, spiders ( ...not spiders again, my god ), and a giant, long-legged, tentacled cow-something that walks around mooing like a foghorn. Why don't these guys try something new... like giant comb jellies or flying toasters.<br/><br/>At least the Sci-Fi channel has silly titles like ""Mansquito"" that are clear cues to lower your expectations and/or stock up on beer.

","So a lot of people have pointed out that the screenwriter, Frank Darabont, also wrote the film version of The Shawshank Redemption. What a lot of people don't know is that the ending we got in that film wasn't the one Darabont wanted. See, in his original script, Andy got trapped ten feet from the end of that 500 yard sewer pipe, and drowned in liquified human feces. Then Red hanged himself from the same rafter Brooks Hatlen used to kill himself. Then Warden Norton got so rich, he was able to buy eternal youth and marry six supermodels and live in a house made of cocaine.

The plot was fine, but I didn't feel like the movie came alive at any point.<br/><br/>The acting was decent enough, and the directing and editing was so-so. But to be perfectly honest, this looked more like a B-movie (script, plot, editing, settings) than what I expected after Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile - which I both enjoyed immensely.<br/><br/>In fact, I was bored for most of the film. All the scenes where a proper scare _could_ have been included, got ruined to obvious build-ups, and actors screaming before the visual part hit.<br/><br/>To me, this was a below average scare film. Can't even begin to compete with Tale of Two Sisters, The Ring etc. And it was a big letdown from Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile."
"justusdallmer","4","8","16","25 January 2008"," One of the worst scripts ever
","*** Spoilers !!! *** First the good things: overall this piece of junk is quite entertaining. It says that the army is evil, that fundamental Christians are evil. The hopeless end is nice, as shocking. - But it was difficult to sit through the first 90 minutes of this rubbish, without laughing out loud all the time, and thus disturbing the audience in the theater. It was hard to stay quiet... I wanted to make fun all the time: 1st) the dialogues were the silliest, most stupid ones I remember in any mainstream, multi-million $$$ trash. Well, there are some Ed Wood movies with similar bad dialogue... 2nd) The wife (thank god she disappeared quickly from the movie - her grimacing made me sick!) and the boy were the greatest over-actors ever - again, I thought some high school pupils were trying to imitate Ed Wood. 3rd) type casting was pushed into its extremes - the characters looked so typical as if they had been animated for Japanese television. 4th) the characters acted so unbelievably stupid as if their brains had been sucked out already by all those bloodsucking freak creatures. 5th) the delayed tentacle melt-down. WHY did it wait so long? 6th) the „good“ soldier (typecasted as „The-guy-in-„Pearl-Harbour“-Josh-what’s-his-name?-Lookalike“) looked like an alien, with all this make-up, eyebrows and expressionist expressions. 7th) the fact that none of the characters knew the „Alien“-movies. Didn’t they live on planet earth before this mist?!?<br/><br/>And here I reached the point to mention good movies which were ripped off by this bad mist-movie. Better watch these movies again, instead of „Mist“: 1st) „Alien“ and „Aliens“ were copied. James Cameron’s team should sue Darabont for using his ideas and copying the images.<br/><br/>2nd) Romero’s „Night of the living dead“ and „Dawn of the dead“ also saw „normal“ people trapped by bloodsucking beasts („Dawn...“ even took place in a supermarket, too). But I believed what their characters were doing and saying. In Romero’s stories they had no better choice to react. There was logic. But in „Mist“ I always fell out of the movie, because the characters were so stupid, acted so out of story and logic: they acted without relating to what was happening around them. They even say „Let’s get out of here“ or „Turn off the lights“ or „Use the axe“ or „How can I persuade you?“ or „I will find a way“ - but they don‘t DO it. They ignore what they said a second ago. A good movie imitates life: there is no delay, no talking - just doing. In „Mist“ there is: NOTHING. The action always had to stop and wait for the stupid characters to collect their brains. And the characters shout then they need to be quiet, they switch their lights on when they should hide, they kill themselves when they should fill up their gas tanks...<br/><br/>And Romero’s movies had Afro-American HEROES, while the family-father was the asshole. But in the ugly, racist, old-fashioned „Mist“, the Afro-American Single is the asshole, while the WASP family man is (intended as) the good guy. At least, in the end, the wonderful white guy gets the punishment for all (t)his stupidity: so I also got my reward for sitting through this movie scum.<br/><br/>3rd) De Palma’s „Carrie“: I guess that the annoying and endless „fundamental Christians bashing“ is Stephen King’s influence; but „Carrie“ 1 + 2 were more than sufficient to let us all become Pantheists or Atheists.<br/><br/>4th) Hitchcock’s „The Birds“ also had a group of passersby-people hiding in some kind of paradise (a pub), while greedy animals tried to eat them. But this part of the „The Birds“ only lasted a few minutes, before Hitchcock was clever enough to blow the pub out of the story (in a big explosion) (the following story „family in their home“ is not what „Mist“ is ripping off). While „Mist“ stayed nearly two hours in the supermarket, annoying us with unnecessary love affairs and repetitive, seemingly endless religious preachings - so annoying that the audience in my theater applauded when the preaching finally stopped.<br/><br/>Better watch this turkey award candidate at home, so your laughter won’t disturb anybody."

"MOOVYZ","3","9","19","22 November 2007"," Almost a TV version... Darabont finally disappoints!
","I am a huge fan of Frank Darabont. My number 1 movie (and number 2 on IMDb)is the Shawshank Redemtion. Also in my top 10 and very high here as well is The Green Mile. Both are adaptations of Stephen King short stories but more importantly, both are non-horror short stories. This was Durabant's forte. I've never seen a good version of a King horror and this one misses as well. His horror work should simply stay on paper.<br/><br/>The film starts OK with Thomas Jane as a husband and father in Maine. A wicked storm blows in (lliterally blowing a tree in to his art studio. After assessing the damage with his former-enemy neighbor Jane runs into town with his kid in tow and his neighbor to get some needed supplies.<br/><br/>AT this point the movie is fine. Good characters, good acting, good dialog. But then the Mist rolls in and everyone get a bit freaked out. Why, they've never seen fog? But of course they must already know that this is no ordinary mist. The next few minutes build a bit of tension but that immediately goes away when they *** Spoiler alert** roll up the grocery back door. Here come the creatures and boy are they ever creatures. But what are they? One with huge tentacles, one that looks much like the water tentacle in The Abyss. Someone dies and the group goes into the market to describe to all what they just saw. Only the others think it's a joke. This is where the film really strays away from what would be real reactions and goes into several character developments that just don't fit and don't work.<br/><br/>Soon there's more creatures and once again they don't fit or work. Clearly looking like robots or man-made CGI creatures, followed by more and more. Blah! These creatures don't look real, not from this planet yet no one ever says ""what is that?"" Then the movie breaks up into 2 groups, the religious fanatic based group led by a ""diturbed"" woman (who no one would EVER follow). The other group is made up of our here and the only normal people in the group.<br/><br/>Off we go into human sacrifice and warring factions... all the while we have little or no idea what's happening and few are asking those important questions.<br/><br/>I will stop here as I won't ruin the one redeeming, but predictable aspect in regards to how it ends. You see it coming and it's your typical King bizarre, in your face, ending.<br/><br/>Overall, this looks like a made for TV miniseries complete with frequent fades to black for commercials (edited for TV already, now that's thinking ahead!)The dialog is just not what people would be saying. The actions of the people caught up in this tragedy are also not what people would do. The creatures look man-made and fake. The tension is just not there.<br/><br/>I rate this a 3 out of 10 only for the few good performances we see.<br/><br/>I simply can't believe that my favorite Director got caught up in this one. Having made my favorite and perfect movie once in Redemtion, it's unfathomable that he could also churn out one of my all time worst. I nearly walked out and I NEVER do that! Wait for video, if at all. This is real junk."

"jcbutthead86","10","7","14","27 October 2012"," One Of The Best Horror Films Ever Made. Frank Darabont and Stephen King at their best.
","The Mist is one of the best Horror films ever made that works as a Horror Film,Monster Movie,and Character drama. Terrifying,bleak,and filled with hopelessness,The Mist is a Horror classic and one of the best Stephen King adaptations with a stunning ending you will never forget.<br/><br/>Based on Stephen King's novella,The Mist tells the story about people in a small Maine town who are trapped in a supermarket when a huge mist surrounds the market and town unleashing deadly creatures from the mist that attack and kill people. Now the people in the supermarket have to figure out how to survive the mist and creatures and stay alive.<br/><br/>One of the many things I love about The Mist is that not only is it a monster movie,it's a great commentary on people and society when things fall apart. The film is filled with a sense of dread and darkness that you don't see in many Horror films these days because most Horror films that come out these days are glossy and pretty. The Mist is not glossy or pretty,it's an ugly nightmarish film that makes you feel like you're in the film and with the characters good or bad. Claustrophobia is always an important element in a Horror film and the claustrophobic setting inside the supermarket is put to great use in this film. When the people are the supermarket in the beginning of the film,you feel safe and secure,but when The Mist and creatures arrive,you feel the walls are closing in on the characters and that they're trapped. As a you're watching the movie,you feel like the characters are isolated from the world and that The Mist had taken over making the viewers feel like they're in a apocalypse of doom,death and darkness. Probably the most frightening thing about The Mist is that not only the creatures that come out of the mist but the humans inside the market. When the mist comes it not only becomes a great horror film or monster film,but a great character drama,focusing on how the characters react to the situation and how they deal with it and this is one of the things that sets The Mist apart from other modern Horror films. Instead of fighting the monsters and helping each other out,most of the people start to turn on each other and become divided into groups becoming monsters themselves attacking and killing each other when ever they can. The Mist and Frank Darabont gives us a terrifying study of human nature and that human beings will be responsible for their own self destruction and the way the human characters act in the film is haunting,disturbing and scary. I have a feeling the late,great Rod Serling would've loved The Mist because the film reminds me of The Twilight Zone especially classic Twilight Zone episodes The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street and The Shelter. At 126 minutes,The Mist moves at a fast and rapid fire pace and never slows down until the very end. The film's screenplay by Frank Darabount is great and stays true to Stephen King's novella with scenes and dialog that are from the book with a few differences and a little minor alterations. The ending of the film is one of the boldest, greatest,jaw dropping and shocking endings in movie history. How Frank Darabont convinced the movie's studio to o.k the ending is stunning to me and it's one the reasons The Mist is a classic. I won't tell you how it ends but I'll you this:the ending in this film is not for people who love happy and uplifting endings,the ending is dark,tragic and very unforgettable. Not since John Carpenter's The Thing and George Romero's Night of the Living Dead has a Horror film ending been so bleak and hopeless. No matter how many times I've watched The Mist the ending still gets to me.<br/><br/>The cast does a great job in their roles. Thomas Jane is excellent as David Drayton the man who tries to take charge when things are falling apart. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant as religious zealot Mrs Carmody,not only one of the best villains in a Stephen King film or book,but in my opinion one of the best villains in film history. Harden's performance is absolutely bone chilling and disturbing and Oscar worthy. A brilliant performance. Laurie Holden does a great job as Amanda,a woman who helps out and sides with David. Andre Braughter is fantastic as Brent,a lawyer who is skeptical about the events and doesn't believe the things that are happening. Toby Jones is wonderful as Ollie a store clerk who becomes a man of Action. Darabont regulars William Sadler(Jim)and Jeffrey DeMunn(Dan)are great as always in their roles. Frances Sternhagen(Mrs Reppler),Nathan Gamble(Billy Drayton),Alexa Davalos(Sally),Chris Owen(Norm),Sam Witwer(Private Jessep),Robert Treveiler(Bud)and David Jensen(Myron) do fine jobs in their roles as well. If you're a fan of the TV show The Walking Dead you will see a few of the actors(Laurie Holden,Jeffery DeMunn,Melissa McBride) who are on the show. <br/><br/>Frank Darabont's direction is fantastic bringing a gritty and dark tone to the film. In the other Stephen King films The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile Darabont's direction and lighting were bright,clean and straight forward,but in The Mist the direction and lighting are chaotic and dark and intense with Darabont using hand-held photography and a semi-documentary feel to the film almost feels like an independent movie. Great direction from Darabont.<br/><br/>Mark Isham's score while not used much is effective fits with the film's dark tone. Dead Can Dance's song The Host Of Seraphim is haunting and eerie and blends wonderfully with the films tragic and sad ending. It's a song that will stay with you.<br/><br/>In final word,The Mist is a Horror classic that will stay with you after watching it and if you love Horror,Frank Darabont,or Stephen King see this film. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","A mysterious mist descends on a town accompanied by loud sirens. Something's hidden in the misty fog, and people are heard making death screams. Horror a la King demands we have some average folks herded together in a small place and face the crisis; this time a grocery store is used. <br/><br/>King's characters are usually much more believable and sympathetic than we see here. This town is populated with an array of psychos, under-achievers, and dimwits. Everybody that goes to buy milk at this particular grocery store likes to argue with each other. There's a religious zealot character that's written so far over the top you have to wonder if a nun gave Stephen a spanking when he was a kid. King makes her the fulcrum of the story, and the film never recovers from this poor construction. She incites mob hysteria, panic, hostility, and murder. Only a few people resist her, and even those individuals act as whack as she does. Nobody thinks clearly, everybody acts stupidly, and the audience is given no reason to empathize with any of the characters; very likely, you'll root for the mist creatures. Violent acts are shown to be the solution to any disagreement. Military covert operations and the monsters are thrown in almost as an after thought.<br/><br/>The full measure of King's character-study of society in Mist can be summed up as follows: ""Everybody and anybody is an idiot."" No deeper than that. That's the biggest problem with this: there's such a pessimistic view that it grates quickly. Grisly deaths are just offered up as proper come-uppance for the victims, as if King believes the zealot is right, after all. The ironic twist at the end is especially indicative of this.<br/><br/>With more honestly written characters in a film predicated on character study, this film could have worked. As it is, King attempts a social commentary dimension that he can't handle. It makes him look foolish."

"MattBirk","8","4","7","13 March 2015"," One of the Best Creature Features of the 21st Century
","A movie with more than one nightmare occurring at the same time, The Mist demonstrates that humans are just as brutal as the monsters that stalk us. I have to admit that this movie was a challenge to watch, not because of copious amounts of gore (which it doesn't have), but because of the religious lady who made their situation so much worse than it already was. She slowly starts unraveling the band of survivors with her constant monologues about God and the rapture, and how blood must be spilled in order for them to survive. Her character was so over the top, that she has to be considered one of the most annoying and difficult characters in movie history. <br/><br/>But that may just be the genius behind the movie, focusing on the many people turn to religion in times of crisis no matter how ludicrous it may seem and then pitting them against rational thinking characters. This type of social and religious commentary makes the movie work on multiple levels and helps the movie avoid becoming just another creature feature with a large body count and CGI overkill.<br/><br/>The Mist mainly focuses on the characters trapped inside the store and their tale of survival, not from the monsters outside, but the people on the inside tearing them apart internally. But don't get me wrong, there are plenty of crazy monsters lurking in the mist and we get to see plenty of them throughout the movie, and they are terrifying! The abilities or traits that certain creatures possess are terrifying, all sorts of nightmares are out there just waiting for them. <br/><br/>This was an interesting movie, entertaining, yes, but also challenging because the movie tries to have smart characters front and center, but they are held back by not so smart characters. And I of course need not to discuss the ending, it's already been written down in movie history as one of the most shocking endings ever. The Mist certainly is one of the better horror movies of the 21st century!"
"nglennh","1","7","15","25 May 2008"," Are you KIDDING?!
","I warn you, this film was made-for-TV (seriously, time the fade-out and in's. one every 10 minutes or so), and even by those standards was painful to sit through. It's claim to fame is a pathetic attempt at a punch-out ending. This movie touches on several subjects of human nature that about 500 other films have already covered, so... Mr king, I don't really need any more ""deep messages"" as I've seen 'em all before. As for it's terror factor, I've been more frightened by a fuzzy-wuzzy hamster. <br/><br/>***Spoiler Warning!!***<br/><br/>But given all it's directorial and editing shortcomings, this movie's real failure is it's ending. Let me break it down for those of you considering this film. The character development simply does not make sense. The supporting characters in the film each have a specified, stereotypical role. They are thin and lifeless. The main protagonist, on the other hand, spends the whole movie with such a strong will to live. His whole persona is built on that drive for survival. Then after facing monsters, aliens, and a crazy mob of religious zealots he is finally brought to his knees by an empty tank of gas. That's right. Ran outta gas. Nothing to do but give up on life and put a few bullets into my kid. His actions are simply unrealistic given how his character is portrayed for the first 2 hours. I'm not complaining that it wasn't a happy ending. Far from it, I love unconventional endings, but this one was an absolute failure. The protagonist was not driven to a point of desperation severe enough to justify blowing his kids brains all over the car seat."
"desolator144","1","18","49","24 November 2007"," Not even close to a modern movie
","Everyone's saying how classic this movie is and how like the 1950's it is. Well I'm 20 and it sucks. It's predictable and stupid just like old horror movies. They may have been fun and entertaining back in the day but now they're idiotic. I can't believe they tried to pass this off as a modern movie! When you compare circumstances, results, and even lines, it's exactly the same as that other Stephen King movie with the weird guy and the storm and island community and the ""give me what I want and I'll go away."" Seriously, it's like he recycled that exact storyline. If you saw the entire movie you really know what horribly recycled part I'm especially talking about too. The only difference is that THIS movie isn't quality enough to be shown on the sci fi channel. Aside from the story, the acting and script is so far from true to life human interaction and dialogue, it's laughable. They couldn't even make a simple, short argument scene remotely realistic. If gorillas could talk, the argument they'd have was in this movie. For the entire movie the audience around me made it obvious that the decision was unanimous about what we wanted characters to do in every circumstance and they always did the opposite like a bunch of idiots. They weren't even people, they were props to tell the story. It was like you wanted to scream ""tell her to shut up"" or ""run, dumbass!"" or ""just do it this way!"" or ""if you don't do this, that will happen"" but they never did because that just wouldn't fit in the plot. Absolutely horrendous writing. The movie is rated R because it's grosser and gorier than Saw and Stephen King should be locked up forever for making the ending the way he did just for its cheap shock value. Everyone walked out saying ""That's awful! That movie sucked!"" I have no idea how the hell it currently has such a high rating. What's wrong with you people?! Don't ever see this movie."
"nankipu","9","11","27","13 November 2007"," Stephen King finally done right!!!!
","First off, we all know that King never translates well to film. We've seen one disaster after another as his stories fail to impress us in the cinema. Well, this changes that trend, at least for me.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with the original novella, right away you will be annoyed by how quickly you are rushed through the set up for the story and characters. it's like being taken by the arm and ushered through. However, that is only the first twenty minutes. Once past the establishing exposition, the film settles down into a reasonable pace.<br/><br/>David Drayton (Thomas Jane), after surviving a devastating freak storm with his family, surveys the damage on his homestead. Almost casually his attention is drawn to a strange mist on the river by his home. His neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braughter) has neglected a large diseased tree which in the aftermath of the storm has crashed through the front window of Drayton's home. Drayton and Norton have a history of animosity that includes an unspecified lawsuit that Drayton won. Not wanting to make more problems, Drayton confronts his neighbor civilly, asking for his insurance information. In an attempt to keep good blood Drayton and his young son Billy (Nathan Gamble) take Norton into town to buy supplies.<br/><br/>The local grocery is packed and they have no power. As Drayton and his son wait in line, a local man runs into the shop covered in blood screaming about monsters in the mist.<br/><br/>So it begins. The film centers on the patrons trapped in the shop. The characters are fascinating, and very well played. Special attention should be paid to the obligatory religious nutcase Mrs. Carmody, played with hate-inducing vigor by Marcia Gay Harden. Also, to shopkeeper Ollie played by Toby Jones. His is a staple King character: the unassuming little man no one really thought much about who proves the greatest hero and the strongest spirit of all of them. Jones really seems to understand this character and his performance is a stand-out of the cast. My personal favorite character is Hattie played by Susuan Malerstein. From what i have gathered, this is her first trip in front of the camera. She plays a wonderful, feisty grandma (another King staple) trapped in the shop and ultimately fights the monsters right next to the best of them.<br/><br/>The special effects were handled by KNB, Greg Nicotero's company and as always he does not disappoint. A combination of practical and CGI effects give us the ""monsters in the mist"". I saw very few seams in the CGI and blue screen, and the ones I did see were very hard to notice. I only saw them because I'm a nerd and I look for them.<br/><br/>The film has a different ending from the novella, played through from the original ending. It makes sense as a natural progression from where King left off in the original story.<br/><br/>Most of the camera work is hand held which adds to the realism. It is almost a documentary, cinema verite if you will and pulls you into the story. The characters are a little flat, like in many films of this genre, but yet you sympathize with them.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is non-existent. The majority of the film plays out without any music at all, adding to the realism. What music is in the film is used sparingly, including an inspired choice of a track from the goth/emo band Dead Can Dance.<br/><br/>Overall, and without giving too much away, I highly recommend this film. I can't say enough how much i enjoyed it, or how this is the best Stephen King adaption I've seen since Carrie.<br/><br/>you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss 10 bucks goodbye and want to see it again"

","If only I had seen the B/W version first, I would have marked it higher! The movie was good, not great but good. You see it in color and you lose so many things. But man when you see it in B/W… Wow it is a whole different movie. I know that many people can’t stand watching a movie in black and white and prefer it in color, but if you get a chance watch it in B/W. you will see a different world. This is for the people who can appreciate B/W movies! I love B/W movies because they seem more real than the movies that are coming out today. When you see movies with special effects after 2 or 4 years you think how fake the sequences seem. But old movies seem like they are from another universe, where everything is allowed. You see Bigfoot, but you can believe that it is really him in the screen not a green screen. This is the illusion of that the old movies create. That is the illusion that the B/W version created for me. But for those who don’t like this version and prefer color you will find it quite interesting. I liked it a lot. I am a big Stephen King fan so even if the movie has a little bit to do with his book I want to see it! This movie is really good and I enjoyed it a lot. The idea of the book was so crazy and the movie was insane too so I had a really good time watching it! I think Frank Darabont, the director, did an amazing job putting it all together and took him few days to finish it (37 days if I am not mistaken)."

","In Frank Darabont's 'The Mist', we find ourselves locked inside of a grocery store with about 20 or 30 other people. And there's a catch...<br/><br/>You can't leave, or else you will die.<br/><br/>Stephen King's original story captured the minds and imaginations of hundreds of thousands of people, including mine, with the thought of monsters in a mist. You're being attacked by monsters, you know that. But what do these monsters look like? You can't see an inch in front of your face in the mist.<br/><br/>Darabont, the masterful director behind such amazing films as 'The Shawshank Redemption', and 'The Green Mile' made a great film once more.<br/><br/>It captures the claustrophobic feeling, the thought that once you run out of food, then what will happen? What if the plate-glass window in the front of the store breaks? What if these things get in? And just to put the cherry on top: watch out for the religious nut, Mrs. Carmody.<br/><br/>The film has one downside: the music towards the end. To me, that's the only thing.<br/><br/>Yes, it's true the ending is depressing, yes, it's hopeless. But if you think it's too hopeless, too depressing, then you've got to spend sometime on a place I like to call earth.<br/><br/>In the words of Jim Morrison, ""No one here gets out alive.""

","I really liked the concept of the movie, and the monsters really kept me into this, but I could not stand for how the characters reacted to the situation. It seemed like every time something happened, they would all go into shut down mode and just complain that they were going to die. Even when someone finally motivates them to do something, that movement is crushed quickly and again the people are depressing and lifeless. On a good note, the characters in the movie acted more like real people would (i.e. barricades and torches), but if people acted like they do in the majority of the movie... I would have shoved them out for the creatures to get. I think I could have dealt with some of the bad story line if only the ending had been different. You kind of get the feeling like ""Ah-ha they are finally doing something"" to thinking ""WTF!!! Why would they do that!?"" most of the way through the movie.<br/><br/>I can't say I am not glad that I watched this movie, I just wish I hadn't wasted money to rent it.

"alan_smithee_2008","4","6","13","5 April 2008"," A superior film ruined by the ending
",">>> SPOILERS THROUGHOUT -- PROCEED WITH CAUTION <<< <br/><br/>I rented ""The Mist"" with high expectations. I'd read the original Stephen King novella some years back and enjoyed it greatly, both as a gripping exercise in terror and a chilling study of how quickly regular people can descend into savagery when denied their basic needs and freedoms. For the most part, Frank Darabont's film adaptation did not disappoint. I found it highly faithful to King's work, maintaining the character dynamics, ominous mood and emotional power of all the key scenes. With a single (but significant) exception, Darabont's vision is an impressive accomplishment in its own right.<br/><br/>The movie is nicely shot and builds its suspense carefully, balancing scenes of intense horror with the requisite calmer moments. I particularly enjoyed how viewers, along with the principal characters, are forced to question whether the greater threat is the ravenous creatures outside in the mist or the evil stirring within their own ranks -- an evil personified in a show-stealing turn by Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody. In lesser hands, this over-the-top character could easily have become a laughable caricature, but Harden brilliantly captures Mrs. Carmody's slow transformation from dismissible kook to murderous zealot (and even injects some touches of dark humour, my favourite example being her ""if I needed a friend like you..."" line to Amanda while exiting the washroom). Based on Harden's performance, I had little trouble accepting why so many of the captive shoppers would fall under Mrs. Carmody's sinister, seductive spell. I found myself riveted by most every second of her screen time, from her part in the shocking sacrifice of the young G.I. to her own climactic death scene.<br/><br/>The other characters are effective as well. Thomas Jane ably anchors the film with his solid portrayal of David Drayton, while Laurie Holden, Frances Sternhagen, and King movie regular Jeffrey DeMunn all add fine performances in supporting roles. André Braugher is also juicily officious as Norton, the skeptical attorney. But my vote for most appealing performance belongs to Toby Jones, who brings a mild, unassuming heroism to the role of Ollie Weeks. His sudden death at the hands (er, ""claws"") of the lobster-creature was a truly despairing moment in a movie with more than its share of jolts and gore.<br/><br/>In short, I found myself deeply engrossed in ""The Mist,"" and was fully prepared to add it to my ""Top Ten"" list of favourite films from the past few years... right up until the ending. I don't know exactly what kind of ending I'd been expecting, other than I'd heard it was different from the original and that Stephen King himself wished he'd thought of it when writing his novella. All I can say is, thank God he never did, because while King's finale holds out at least a sliver of hope for the survivors, Darabont's is the bleakest, most dismal movie finale I've seen in probably twenty years. I find it frankly incomprehensible that the director of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (itself with plenty of grim moments, but ultimately an inspiring testament to humanity) could possibly have settled on anything so horrifically depressing. It is also -- to quote Annie Wilkes, another King creation -- a cheat. I can only think that if Darabont had allowed the film to run for ten more seconds, we might at least have gotten the closure of watching David Drayton throw himself under one of the oncoming tanks to complete the cycle. As it stands, the ending is just empty, pointless, and childish. It makes you wonder what the &%#*$^! the point was in getting emotionally involved with these characters and their hellish ordeal in the first place.<br/><br/>It's really too bad. I sensed that ""The Mist"" is one of those films that would have grown richer and more satisfying with repeat viewings, to uncover more character nuance and symbolic elements (like the mist as the human unconscious -- what is obscured, unknown, and feared -- and the three-way tension of reason (Norton), faith (Mrs. Carmody), and the common man (David Drayton)). But for my part, I can't imagine ever sitting through it again when I know there's nothing worthwhile waiting for me at the other end.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10 (averaging 8/10 for the first 116 minutes and 1/10 for the execrable ending)."
"mnpollio","3","6","13","17 March 2008"," A promising effort that derails completely
","I freely admit that I was a fan of the original novella on which this film was based. It has widely been considered one of the best stories in the Stephen King pantheon and there were a variety of rumors circling for years of prominent filmmakers promising to adapt it to the screen. After two successful prior King efforts, writer/director Frank Darabont seemed a promising choice, but there turn out to be problems with this choice. Darabont is a wonderful director with intimate character-driven stories, which was shown to good effect in both The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. However, Shawshank was a straightforward drama. The Green Mile, despite some elements of the supernatural woven into the plot, was anything but a horror film. Darabont tries his first shot at one of King's out-and-out horror stories and the result is a bust. A situation made unfortunate by both the promise of the set-up and the people involved. King's novella focused on a group of people who endure a freakishly severe storm and then take refuge in a local grocery store as a mysterious mist closes in bringing assorted horrors with it. While King's source story had its ragged spots, it worked well as an in-your-face scare story with an ambiguous ending. By contrast, Darabont ultimately wants the film to be something a lot more than what the story was, so instead of a rousing jump-out-of-your-seat scare film, we get a patchy social commentary. The end result is unevenly paced and packs a lot less impact than had Darabont just gone ahead and filmed the thriller aspects as the focus. Instead, we get a couple of mildly suspenseful encounters with assorted creatures (rendered with mixed results by CGI) and far too many scenes of tense human confrontations within the store that veer from sweaty whispering to over-the-top shrill shouting, none of which are a fraction as fascinating or insightful as Darabont apparently believes. The cast is made up of solid, reliable actors, which largely do well with their roles. Thomas Jane is a handsome and talented actor, but he is still waiting for his breakout role, and this is not it. He elicits sympathy as the focal character, a father concerned with the safety of his young son and the wife that he left back at home, and wisely eschews overdoing the action elements. The only time his performance fails to ring true are during his final histrionic moments. Laurie Holden is appealing, but does not have a lot to do here. Better still are Toby Jones and Frances Sternhagen (the latter largely underused). By contrast, the only major acting misstep comes from Marcia Gay Harden chomping the scenery as a borderline psychotic religious fanatic who makes matters worse inside the market. While I find the character largely believable (let's face it, people like this are becoming more and more common in the world), a little bit of her goes a long way and a character that felt like a supporting role in the novella seems expanded on film beyond reason to promote Darabont's new social commentary designs. Arguably the saddest part about the film is that it does succeed in a modest way until its final moments blow it completely out of the water, much in the way that the film Blow Out fell apart in its final moments, when its lead character acted in a totally incoherent and inappropriate way. While I have nothing against films, particularly horror films, having downbeat endings, it needs to grow naturally from the story and not seem to be there only to shock. The final moments of the film find a handful of the survivors fleeing the grocery store lest they become sacrifices for the religious fanatics and making a run for freedom in their car. A scant few minutes later they decide to commit suicide en masse, with Jane's father shooting his young son in the head, only to have...wait for it...the US army roll by a few moments later appearing to successfully drive off any monsters with their tanks and flame-throwers. So, in other words, any characters that have generated rooting interest end up dead as basically a punchline. Unlike a thriller like Seven, where the shocking conclusion seemed appropriate and to add to the film, The Mist serves up a pitch black ending that ultimately serves no purpose, seems tacked on, and features characters acting in ways completely at odds with their personalities. Why leave the store at all? They could have surrendered themselves to the fanatics and it would have made more logical sense. And having the army roll through to save the day sheer moments later in a perverse gotcha incredibly draws more attention to the stupidity of it all. Some viewers at my screening actually burst out laughing at how inane it was, which I hardly think is the reaction Darabont was hoping for here. Unfortunately, the ending has the tendency to tarnish any of the successful elements that happened before and leaves a really bad taste. It is ironic they chose this route along with a Thanksgiving/Christmas release time because I was completely at sea as to who they thought would give this climax good word of mouth - and judging from the dismal box office returns, apparently it was no one."
"aaronstewart87","1","6","13","10 February 2008"," The Definition of Predictable
","I will outline my thoughts in bullet points The beginning highlights the fact of a tree destroying a house - no explanation - when you realize it's related to the mist it does not explain how it happened and why it was so significant Normal chaos to the prototype stereotypical normal people and escalated too predictably.<br/><br/>Supermarket for safety theme has been done and in this movie was poorly percepted.<br/><br/>The things from the other portal planets where just pathetic. They really over emphasized the definition on aliens and the effects where rather old fashioned.<br/><br/>When the aliens break in the chaos is so pathetic it's funny. People try to light a mop on fire and as predicated, knock oil into the fire. People have trouble shooting stalling I can't write more I'm angry I thought I was watching alien when they started using humans as objects to give birth to their kind.<br/><br/>The idea of the military being at fault was far to obvious and seeming as though it was highlighted so much in the film they should have elaborated on it earlier.<br/><br/>The ending scenes were better as it became slightly more realistic in accordance with the situation.<br/><br/>I did not how he tried to reach for the gun and stalled when during that time he could have got out and taken the gun and driven away.<br/><br/>When they come across the giant bug the stare for a while and I noticed there normal birds. Um How? Did they survive that attack of the aliens? When he shot his friends and family it was far too obvious it was going to be the army. I said it before it happened and when it unfolded I laughed so much as I was correct with another predictable scene.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie takes the ideas and themes from other movies and has tried to roll it into one with the new underlying theme of a portal which constitutes the new theme for the movie. The only things separating this movie from other movies is the very fact of an alien portal. The have tried to make horror by old fashioned tentacles etc and big cockroaches. So dated My final thought is that this movie is the very definition of predictable and more importantly WHAT THE HELL WAS WITH THE MIST IT WAS NEVER EXPLAINED IT WAS SO IRRELEVANT.<br/><br/>I give this movie two points for effort and two points for trying to drag out the mist mystery - a good tactic for making people stay and watch until the end"
"Pavel-8","7","6","13","28 December 2007"," Do you have any hope at all in humanity?
","I haven't read any of Stephen King's books or stories, but I have learned two things from his movies. He possesses phenomenal insight into the human mind, and he is a freak. ""The Mist"" proves both points fully with a simple story: a mist engulfs a small New England town, and a few dozen of its denizens are isolated in a grocery store, forced to deal with enemies both outside and inside the store, both strange and familiar.<br/><br/>The best and brilliant parts of ""The Mist"" are the explorations into the psyche of the various trapped townsfolk. If someone's character is truly exposed when under pressure, then the extreme circumstances of this movie strip souls down to their essences, with frightening results. There are heroes and villains, leaders and followers, stalwarts and cowards. In previous uses of King's source material, writer/director Frank Darabont burrowed into the heart of hope in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and delved into faith and the supernatural with ""The Green Mile"". Both movies placed normal people into extreme circumstances, and did so exceptionally well. In that general thematic regard, Mist is similar to those two excellent films. More specifically though, it varies greatly, stressing the negative aspects of humanity rather than positive traits. Along the way, plenty of complex issues arise, and they are most frequently addressed with a rough, dull blade that gashes boldly through the moral fiber of civilization. The results are rarely pretty, but always compelling.<br/><br/>Lest you think this is a philosophical art house movie, let it be known that as a horror flick, independent of any deeper meaning, ""Mist"" consistently entertains, with a handful of superb knuckle-whitening scenes enhanced by an excellent cast. But a dark decision in the final act makes it impossible for even the most casual moviegoer to completely ignore the thick subtext of King and Darabont.<br/><br/>What prevents ""The Mist"" from being a great movie is the frayed nature of that subtext. While the story is rife with interesting points, the commentary fails to coagulate into a comprehensible bigger picture. In a sense though, the fractured themes better befit such a moody picture, one that strikes its audience at many levels, leaving the mind spinning in a mist of its own.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 7 of 10 for a movie far smarter and deeper than the glut of recent horror releases."

And the director has been really the only director who has done a good job of adapting his stories into movies. So It was with great displeasure to see such a bad movie. CGI was terrible, I was not very scared or held in suspense. Overall I feel like this is another run of the mill crappy suspense horror-wannabe. Not trying to turn people off from seeing this but with such a great original story, it could have been done so much better. I read the story and thought ""They HAVE to make a movie about this one day."" And I was really excited.. maybe my hopes were too high?"

If you took the five minute rants of misquoted and twisted scripture bashing out of the dialog, there would nothing left of the script but a silly ""I don't know what's happening"" movie. I am seriously disappointed that Thomas Jane would be in such a movie and I seriously hope that Hollywood is not making it the new wave to mock and blaspheme God just to sell a movie. The fact it stuck to stereotyping the ""crazy misquoting Christian"" as the local nut job, the ""underachiever"" as the hick, the black city lawyer as arrogant, the woman who was watching children as a whore, the red neck element and of course, no one working at a grocery store has a high intellect... the ending was just plain terrible.

","I've only written a couple of reviews on IMDb over the past few years, but I can't let this movie slide. I feel an obligation to warn people who appreciate good horror films to not see this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, most of the scenes would not have worked if the characters involved had had any common sense whatsoever. For instance, they constantly walk or stand still when they should be running. This happens over and over. I lost track of how many times I yelled, ""get out of there, you idiot!"" or ""why are you just standing there!?"" at the TV. I don't remember the last time a movie frustrated me so badly. I guarantee this movie will tick you off about every ten minutes throughout the long, aggravating 2 hours and 5 minutes.<br/><br/>And what will tick you off the most is the ending. The last few minutes take a disturbing and shocking turn for the sole purpose of being shocking and disturbing, completely disregarding what any normal people with any common sense would actually do. It's nothing but shock value and it will frustrate you to no end. It pretty much destroys what little chance this movie had at being at least a B rated horror flick and instead turns it into a depressing, aggravating waste of time.<br/><br/>I'm a Stephen King fan and I've read the original ""The Mist"". It's been a while, but I remember that it was creepy and that I liked it. However, the movie adaptation is a tremendous let down."

","As I like to say, Stephen King is a good psychologist and this movie proves it once again. His books are the basics among the new style horror movies, but no director has managed to put it on screen as well as Frank Darabont. In order to see an evolution, this movie continues the critic bought to our sick society by Darabont in his masterpiece ""The Green Mile"". Based on a very common subject nowadays, the alien invasion and experiments gone wrong, ""The Mist"" is above because of the critic given to our sick society. A movie that involves many religious conflicts and shows us how one person can change everybody's opinion in a bad way only by true faith. However this movie shows his best part only in the last two minutes, so don't bail because you cannot understand. Unfortunately this movie is not for everybody because the atmosphere is horrible and not anybody can stay in the seat until the very end. Have a good watch and don't start swearing at the end like i did."
"rayato","10","7","16","31 March 2008"," An Insanely Underrated Horror Masterpiece. Rent It!!!!!!!!
","There are many possibilities why 'The Mist' tanked at the box office. Maybe people didn't want to see a horror film during the holidays. Maybe people didn't think Frank 'Green Mile' Darabont could pull off a horror flick. Maybe everyone just thought it was the sequel to the horrible Tom Welling flick 'The Fog'. Whatever the reason may be, I really hope this film gets the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>The performances are top-notch, surprising for a horror flick. Standouts include Thomas Jane as the protagonist and Marcia Gay Harden as the crazy religious lady. I think Harden deserved an Oscar for that film because she's probably the most hated character in a film in the past year (yes, she's even more evil than Anton Chigurh and Daniel Plainwiew).<br/><br/>The CGI wasn't bad. The tentacle scene reminded me of 'Deep Rising'but it was actually scary. That's the other thing about 'The Mist': when you start watching the film, you don't suspect the horrors that will ensue. At. All. And the most terrifying thing about the film is not the monsters but how the characters act when faced with certain doom.<br/><br/>As for the controversial ending, I gotta say it was rough. It wasn't as off-putting as the final scenes of 'Funny Games' but it was unexpected. And the aftermath was even more unsettling.<br/><br/>Overall, I did not expect to like this film as much as I did. If you want to rent a REALLY good horror film you can't do better than 'The Mist'.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"aharmas","10","7","16","1 December 2007"," Darabont and King Might Have Just Made The Perfect Horror Film
","Darabont and Stephen King joined forces together and landed at #2 in the list of the top 250 films of all time in this website, and that other movie constantly shows up in many of the most admired and beloved films ever. Subsequent films haven't been of the same quality, but their latest collaboration is certainly as close to a masterpiece as anything that came out in 2007. This is a film that others will have to be measured against.<br/><br/>Here is a film that strikes a perfect balance between the graphic and special effects elements with an insightful, philosophical, and incisive look at the complexities of human nature when confronted with its deepest fears. A small town in the state of Maine is suddenly enveloped by a mysterious mist, an element that hides something that could be highly dangerous and might harbor the final apocalyptic moments of the human race. Darabont builds the tension from the opening moments of the film, as he introduces a freak storm that is a harbinger of more horrific things to come. He is in firm control of his camera and his crew, as the odds are stacked against the people of this city. They have found refuge in a small supermarket and are as safe as they can be for the time being, but tensions are brewing within the group, and little by little religious fanatics and pragmatists find that there is a very thin line between sanity and madness.<br/><br/>This is when this movie truly takes off, the exchanges between actors of the caliber of Marcia Gay Harden, a woman who is a zealot and truly thinks what is happening is a sign the end is near. Before we know it, she has whipped the crowd into a frenzy that produces devastating results. On the other side, the group led by Thomas Jane is finding that actions just have to be taken soon, or the end will truly be near.<br/><br/>Watching Gay Harden's character descend into the very logical madness she believes is truly frightening, even more frightening than the creatures King has managed to conjure this time out. The effects are used sparingly and are very effective, as the monsters come out at key times in the film, striking the humans down and festering whatever strength they might have.<br/><br/>In the end, and the end of this film is truly apocalyptic in its intensity and message, we might be led to think that hope lies somewhere at the end of the road, but watching the measures taken by man when facing the end is indeed devastating. Getting to this very emotional conclusion is an exhausting and rewarding journey; experience the cathartic moment will wipe the audience of whatever resistance they could still have. All of this is accomplished by Darabont's excellent direction, and a very haunting score by Mark Isham, a musical genius whom we don't get a chance to hear very often.<br/><br/>There are a few original moments in ""The Mist"", but we have seen a lot of it before, and hopefully detractors will admire the fact that Darabont has paid tribute to some of the finest films ever made in this amazing film. You will gasp even more as you recognize classic references to ""Alien"", ""The Thing"", ""The Fog"", ""Children of Men"", ""Poltergeist"" and a few others horror films.<br/><br/>It is truly my hope that the members of the critic unions and the people who award that standard of quality for film-making look beyond their preconceptions of the themes that should be recognized at the end of the year. Here is a very intelligent and insightful movie that forces to look inside of what believe, or what we are, and what might eventually become when faced with the truth. The beauty and the power of the word is very evident here, as is the use of light and shadow to portray the demons that we all fears, and of course, the film manages to utilize the talents of their actors to create feelings and images that otherwise would be just average and taken into the realm of the sublime.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is a great movie!"

","Gawds how I wanted to give this a full 10 stars! I've waited 20 years for this movie to be made!

The CG monsters and bugs were actually a little better than expected -- and did not detract from the experience. The kick to the gut came at the end...and that is truly what it felt like...a big-ass kick in the gut.<br/><br/>If Darabont wanted to evoke an emotional response in viewers he succeeded: I've never felt more sick and cheated in my life. I sat there wishing I had never come into the theater. I KNOW King himself endorsed the ""new ending"" but that horrible ending changed the entire timbre of the story. In my book, Darabont's ending is senseless and needlessly morbid. It does not add to the movie in any way; in fact I felt the operatic finale was over-the-top cheesy! Unnecessary.<br/><br/>If the last five minutes had been different I would be voting 10 stars right now. Thanks for ruining 20 years of anticipation, Mr Darabont!

","The Mist is a thrilling film about a town swept over by, well, mist... and the movie focuses on a supermarket that has roughly a hundred trapped local citizens, along with a few out-of-towners. Everyone is confused about what is going on, but a few people stick out as they try to pressure their ideas onto others. Some are petrified of the mist while others believe it's the work of God trying to warn them.<br/><br/>This movie was extremely entertaining. It kept my attention thru the entire 2 hours. First, there's no ""dilly-dallying""; the movie starts off right with a storm. The mist slowly forms over the lake by the horizon once the storm settles. The local run to the supermarket for supplies, but soon upon arrival, the mist swarms to the store and traps them inside. Some try to escape early but are torn away like mice to mice traps. The mist evolves as the movie goes on to these vial creatures that take over everything outside. As days pass, the people become desperate and that's when they try new plans, only leading to more danger.<br/><br/>Here are the strong points of this movie. You don't know what is in the mist for a good part of the movie, which lets your imagination take over. In my opinion, that is much scarier. Another thing is that the mood is set very well: police cars speeding across the supermarket, the bull horn, the rolling of the mist towards the supermarket; the director did a remarkable job. The last thing was the psychological warfare amongst the people at the market. A quote from the movie was a reply to someone who asked why drastic measures needed to be taken, and he said ""People are civilized, but when you take their possessions and put them into the dark, they will listen to anyone who says they have an answer"". This movie isn't just about the mist, it is a metaphor for how trouble or error will only be acknowledged when it occurs. We can be civilized today when everything is normal, but once something happens we are lost. We turn to whomever gives advice or a solution because we are so wrapped up in misery that we will try almost anything to get it back. The Mist is a perfect scenario for this occurrence.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 from me, you don't want to miss this if you have the opportunity. Even reading the book if you could would be great."

He constantly and repeatedly abandons his only child in order to play the hero. He willingly gives his child over to absolute and complete strangers. Towards the end we get a half hearted ""sorry"" from him but they idea that a father would abandon their child constantly when in a disaster scenario is ridiculous unless Drayton is a sociopathic character. He also never seems to care at all about his wife who is all alone. He makes a break for her at the end but that's the first we see him care about her.<br/><br/>There is little to no support for the reactions of the characters. They all decide that the mist is evil and shouldn't be entered well before anything bad happens to prove that they shouldn't enter. Basically a bunch of shoppers just freak out over some fog. They happen to be correct but until multiple bodies pilled up, any normal human would not react how they did.<br/><br/>Most of the characters break out in rash and illogicao anger to manufacture drama.

No, instead they do everything else (most importantly scream) before they eventually close the door. the guy that tries to use the axe uses it to cut the tentacle but not away from the kid but directly where he can hit him. Why?? And in general they act in an unbelievable and illogical way. They are surprised when they realize that the front of the store is made of glass as if they didn't know that already.

This is all well and good and hold some interest, if not a lot, but when it draws to an end, I am sad to say, it destroys any regard you might have had for the characters or the one who created them. It actually makes you laugh in its idiotic attempt to bring... gosh, I don't even know what it tried to do. I'm just telling you, be aware, this movie is one of the worst you will ever see. So please don't even bother... unless you appreciate the kind of meaninglessness most people try to escape when watching a movie."
"j_gordon","4","9","23","10 December 2007"," A weak attempt at a dramatic film
","I was a little skeptical to watch this movie because it sounded a little too much like ""The Fog"" which was a huge disappointment. But I gave it a chance due to the fact it was based on a Stephen King novel (it couldn't be *that* bad, could it?) and it had an overall high rating here on IMDb. It started out pretty decent, and had potential to be a good action/thriller monster movie. The CGI was pretty well done, and it even managed to hold my interest for the most part, but the last 30 minutes or so basically ruined it all for me. It tried too hard to be dramatic and epic, from the choice of music to the acting of the lead character. I was laughing to myself during some of the most ""emotional"" scenes because it was so awful. He played a good role as the Punisher mostly because his lines were all cold and emotionless, but he was a bad choice for this movie. Despite his bad acting, I can even say that I am not sure *anybody's* acting could have saved this movie from the terrible ending. Without going into any details, I will say that I am by no means a sucker for happy endings. I can appreciate the sad ones just as much as the happy, but this one was incredibly idiotic. I left the theater disappointed and surprised so many people enjoyed this movie. I am glad I used a free movie ticket to see it and didn't actually spend any of my money."

","It's official: Stephen King and Frank Darabont hate humanity. It's almost impossible to fathom that these two were responsible for the life-affirming ""Shawshank Redemption"" when you consider their last two collaborations: the covertly vile and morally misguided ""Green Mile"" and now this bleak and hazy endeavor. Here they go back to King's roots in this horror tale of a mysterious mist that falls on a small town and the group of people trapped in a grocery store who must survive the monsters lurking in the fog. Leading the cast are Thomas Jane as the artistic everyman (a stock King character), Laurie Holden as the pretty school teacher, and Nathan Gamble as Jane's emotionally distraught little boy (another King archetype). Also along for the ride are Toby Jones as a spry and sensible grocery clerk, and Andre Braugher as an irate out-of-town lawyer.<br/><br/>Darabont is a director of considerable skill, and it's pretty amazing what he is able to do with a small budget in his depiction of some truly horrifying monsters and well orchestrated bouts of gore. He builds suspense, creates likable characters to root for, and crafts a fun, scary ride for the better portion of the film. Like in all the best horror films, the creatures are symbolic for modern society's ills. Here the filmmakers explore the current ""culture of fear"" that has been created in the wake of 9/11 by politicians and religious zealots. Like most of King's works, humans are even scarier than the creatures as seen in the character portrayed in great over-the-top style by Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden. Her fire and brimstone preaching quickly divides those trapped in the grocery store down the lines of those who will be paralyzed by fear and turn to barbaric ways disguised as religion, and those who will do anything to fight for the right to survive. For the first one hour and forty-five minutes, the audience is treated to a well crafted, allegorical little monster flick, a throwback to those great creature features of the 1950's.<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT!!!!! DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU PLAN TO SEE THE FILM WITH AN OPEN MIND!!!!!* <br/><br/>With less than ten minutes to the credits rolling, Darabont decides to bash his political message into the back of our skulls with all the subtlety of the blunt side of an ax. ""The Mist"" is impossible to talk about without talking about the ending. After keeping the nut-jobs at bay and effectively escaping the grocery story, five of the characters travel in relative safety inside a car to see how far the mist has conquered and if anyone else survived. With the mist still all enveloping, the car runs out of gas. <br/><br/>Nothing Thomas Jane's character says or does (with the exception of promising his young son that he will never let the monsters get him) lead the audience to believe he would do what he does when it seems that all is lost. All throughout the movie he fights and overcomes his fear, yet at the last minute, without even a second-thought, he does the unthinkable with a gun, four bullets, and five people, and is left to wallow in his own misery. His character, and those other people in the car, didn't deserve that. Had he stayed true to his character, before agreeing to shoot everyone in the car after it ran out of gas lest the monsters savagely eat them, he would've stepped out of the vehicle to check things out one last time before giving up. Then he would've seen that the mist was now harmless and heard the army trucks coming. Or had the monsters come and eaten him, as they all feared, then there would still be the four bullets for the four left in the car. Instead we have to suffer through this complete betrayal and are left with images of the writer and director shaking their fingers at us, ""See, you idiots! This is what could happen if you buy into this culture of fear. You become the monsters!"" <br/><br/>Well, I don't buy it. Next time, boys, don't try to be so profound and just deliver us a good monster movie. We know you can you do it. You were so close here. You're really good at writing horror stories, Stephen, and you're an ace behind the camera, Frank, but sadly through ""The Mist"" your disdain for mankind shines brighter than your collective talents."

","Everything that happens on set is stupid and every character deserves a punch in the face. This movie got me anxious and uneasy, in a very annoying way, not the usual horror one. Sure it's an emotionally moving film, but not in an entertaining way. I LOVE horror and shock movies, but this one is just plain painful to watch for a lot of wrong reasons.
1995 CGI, boring monster designs, uninspired location(s?), terrible ending, but the worst thing are stereotypical characters that you're gonna hate with all your guts. I've passed most of the time just hoping them to die the soonest possible.
I wouldn't recommend watching this movie to anyone."
"jackharding89-1","8","4","8","27 September 2008"," At last- a refreshing throwback to the good old American horrors of yesteryear. The Happening, bug off
","Fish and Chips, Ant and Dec, Zig and Zagnot quite the intro' you were expecting, right? Well I certainly hope not. But some things, I'd think you'd agree, are just meant to go together. Add to that list Frank Darabont and Stephen King: the touching, pleasantly out of character page turners of the latter so remarkably reworked in the timeless, superseding film classics of the former. For his third King rework, though, writer/director Darabont's ditched the potent period prison play (see Shawshank Redemption, see Green Mile), opting to grapple with the author's forte: horror. But The Mist is far more permanent, profound and disconcerting than its banal B-movie look and title would suggest. Not only is it somewhat of a religious experience (keep an eye out for the iconography), but it's also a revelation. <br/><br/>In retrospect, the film's form and plot line are as simple as they come: a cryptic mist, veiling a brood of oddball beasties, herds a colony of model Americans into a small-town grocery store. ""There's something in the mist!"" barks a bloody-nosed dweller as he stumbles through the store doors. ""Shut the doors,"" he cries. ""Shut the doors, my god!"" And so, it begins. The archetypal movie Americans vs. a pick and mix of quirky creatures hell bent on taking office. <br/><br/>A cast of relative unknowns star, then, alongside a host of newcomers, non-professionals and unfamiliar faces in this terrifying adap' of King's original tale. The blend of chaos and camaraderie between the characters proving crucial to the tone and impact of the film as Darabont's hand-held, moving cameras bob and weave through the well orientated cast, rack focussing from one plane of depth to another as they bicker over who (or what's) to blame. Terrorists? Scientists? Nature? God? Who or whatever the culprit, survival would appear salient for our classic film players: the valiant leader (Tom Jane at the top of his game), the mental preacher (Marcia Gay Harden at the top of hers), the realist, the klutz, the blonde, the needy kid, the plucky gran', the non-believer, the unsung hero. They're all in there, and more. <br/><br/>All told, The Mist is stylistically nostalgic. A sci-fi/horror hybrid with odd sprinkles of humour that recall the cult classics of Jack Arnold, George A. Romero and John Carpenter. Only better. Yes, better. Darabont's delve into untried territory is a massive achievement in horror movie making. The Shining? Not quite. Darabont may be a maestro of the screen adap' but he's no Stan' Kubrick. There's no disguising The Mist's potential as classic of the horror genre, though. This is a writer/director who's knack for tying an empathic rapport between character and audience pays up front both where and when it matters. Shawshank was a dream. The Mist is a nightmare. But in all the right ways: a murky, tantalizing terror-jolt with added substance. High-concept with a weighty sub-text and a damn low-budget. Darabont's more concerned with probing the humanity of horror than the gore and the guts and the winged, slithery, tentacled fiends hurling themselves at the glass panes. As far as CGI goes, you have and will see better (in fact it's laughable on occasion) but when a film's set-up is this well conceived, it's all right for the special effects to take a back seat. Example? The Birds. Example? Jaws. Another? Alien. Add to this list The Mist. A film rapt on how bloody timid and fragile we humans are in the face of fear. ""As a species we're fundamentally insane,"" utters the unsung hero. ""Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up ways to kill one another,"" I wouldn't go that far, mate. ""Why do you think we invented politics and religion?""Good point.<br/><br/>In spite, then, of its old chestnut line up and rather rushed and ""hazy"" start, from the moment the smog rolls in - swallowing the entire township in one swift gulp - The Mist just gets better and better as it creeps and crawls towards an unruly final third that'll haunt, shock and astound, disturb and confound. And like all great movies, there're plenty of leftovers to chew over. This is a film with something to say whose final stance over matters will lure countless back for seconds, no question.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont has sculpted ominous camera-work, a forbidding score, top performances, lurid tension and shock after shock into a modest macabre with a killer ending to rival that of anything I've ever seen on film. Horror film fans will be pushed to find a more riveting two-hours of pure entertainment than this: a cynical and paralyzing portrait of the humane and the inhumane that certainly isn't satisfying, but it grips like a vice all the same. In a word: mist-ifying."
"rxracer","1","4","8","3 September 2008"," Mist....ifying
","This movie is a sad example of how someone with zero understanding of the human psyche can wreck what could have been a great film. I'll admit I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure if this adaptation stays true to it. I respect Stephen King, so I'd like to think the similarities are limited to the general overview.<br/><br/>An all pervasive mist conceals a horror within. It's unbelievable, but that's what horror movies are about. Sounds cool right? It could have been, except that the writers decided to make EVERYTHING unbelievable. From the crazy religious nut (who you'd normally cross the road to avoid) managing to convince all but a few of the shops residents to join her in stabbing a security guard and sacrificing him, to a father mercy killing his entire family in fear of the mist horror getting them first, without waiting until danger was truly imminent (at the time the mist horror was nowhere to be seen), or waiting to see if help will maybe come, or waiting any great length of time for anything at all. He just pops em. If you didn't know any better you'd think he was late for an appointment.<br/><br/>A lack of realism is expected with horror movies, but only from certain quarters. When it comes to regular human beings, we just don't do things like mercy whack our entire family until it is absolutely, positively, 1000% necessary. Given the complete inconceivability of someone doing what he did without even the vaguest attempt at finding an alternative, it was the worst ending to a movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I'm astonished this movie has gotten the IMDb rating is has. I use this place to preview movies all the time, and this is easily the most over-rated film I've seen here so far. And I'm equally amazed Stephen King let this thing out. The guy is an iconic writer, so I'll just assume they snuck it past him when he was taking a nap.<br/><br/>A lot of people may convince themselves this is good because it's got Stephen Kings name on it, but I can't."

","Oké, the movie is great, let me just say that. I love all the Stephen King movies and was awaiting this one. For the people who still need to see the film, there are no spoilers, but a glimpse of the ending. Finally I saw it. And the ending was shocking. Really. I don't mind a 'not so happy ending', but this is to much. Any normal filmwatching person will be shocked. And there is also something that bothers me. How come they risk everything throughout this film, but when it counts... And also, because of this ending I find the film less believable. On the other end, if it had the ending I thought it would be sappy or (in my worst case scenario: even more shocking, but I would find it more believable). I just finished watching it a few minutes ago, so tomorrow my opinion may be different, but now you got me in the full emotion of the film. And to be honest my tummy still hurts a wee bit.<br/><br/>p.s. sorry for the grammar, English is not my first language."
"jmbwithcats","8","4","8","1 July 2008"," The Mist is more cautionary than we acredit
","The Mist is a movie based on the book by Stephen King, which was inspired by H.P. Lovecraft and The Lord of the Flies. Perhaps even Dawn of the Dead. but whatever influenced it, it must be said it has equally inspired others as well, among them one of the most popular PC Games ""Half Life"".<br/><br/>The Mist brings into focus a military experiment gone awry. Where portals, doorways, windows to other worlds are opened, and what lies beyond is unleashed upon mankind. But it is much more than that. It is a story of faith, and man's worst enemy: ourselves. It talks of the survival instinct but in so that it can lose a fight against our own lack of faith.<br/><br/>So a buddy of mine came over today and made me watch the DVD of this today, even though I watched the movie when it first came out.<br/><br/>Definitely upon second viewing I enjoyed this movie so much more.<br/><br/>The pharmacy scene is incredible. The tentacles ripping chunks of the Sherminator felt visceral. The acidy spider webs were freaky, and it just all worked better for me.<br/><br/>You start out at home, go to the grocery store, to the pharmacy and back to the grocery, then to the finale. This movie really was well-rounded with a lot of story. The actress who played the religious woman was awesome, especially in the scenes where she was talking to God or to the creature who spared her life, that was sweet.<br/><br/>When the military man at the end is explaining what the military was up to, he basically spells out the plot to the game Half-Life, awesome game by the way.<br/><br/>Bernie Wrightson (who designed the Impossibly Tall Creature) said his design was inspired by an illustration from a Lovecraft book that depicted a mass of tentacles atop a bunch of elephant legs.<br/><br/>I think the message was that mankind will bring about it's own destruction. We know curiosity killed the cat, but we rarely think about what it does to us."

","This movie may be one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever brought on screen. Regisseur Frank Darabont, who also directed the great movies Shawshank Redemption (short story by SK) and The Green Mile (book by SK), did it again.<br/><br/>Some people may say that the story is weird. But even the craziest story can make a good movie if the actors are playing their roles convincing. And - hell yeah - they do. I went through so many emotions watching this movie, I really was exhausted afterward. Marcia Gay Harden is doing an incredible job, you just have to hate her. It's these emotions which pull you through the movie, and not one moment gets boring.<br/><br/>The sometimes nervous camera shots and the good soundtrack add to this feelings so you really get dragged into the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects aren't special, but thats not important because all the stuff that happens in the mist is just there to create the special situation inside the store. This isn't a movie about monsters, it's a movie about people in extreme situations.<br/><br/>Please, Frank Darabont, do some more SK movies ;) 10/10"
"Matt_Layden","7","6","14","19 June 2008"," Writing This Review....My Jaw Is Still On The Floor From The Ending.
","After a freak and powerful storm, Drayton, his son and their neighbour ride into town to grab some supplies from the local supermarket. Upon arriving at store, it seems almost everyone in town had the same plan. A man bleeding from the nose runs into the store screaming about something in the mist that attacked him and took his friend. The mist rolls in and everyone is trapped inside, scared of leaving because of the creatures the dwell within it.<br/><br/>When I saw previews for The Mist, I wasn't too impressed. I thought it was going to be another run of the mill Hollywood horror film that wouldn't be scary, thrilling, gory, tense or have any characters that I could give a damn about. That was even with Darabont behind the camera. After finally seeing it, I sit here wrong on all counts. The Mist is just as thrilling and scary and tense as you want it to be, yet it falls short in many areas, mostly out of frustration on my part.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane isn't the best actor around. When you fight fight sharks and John Travolta how far can you really go into a character. Here he gets the chance, being a father who must take care of his scared son, act as a leader in the store and ultimately survive the horror that awaits him outside. Now he does try here, but it comes off as some twilight zone B movie acting. Which is, what I can only assume, is what Darabont wanted. His screaming in the film's conclusion is hurtful, both in terms of acting and in sorrow for the character. His son is given nothing to do but cry and be scared, which you can guess is exactly what a little kid would be in this situation.<br/><br/>The tension created is great, the mist rolls in and everyone is stuck inside. We don't know who or what these things are, but we know we are in for some scary things. Then we actually see them and that tension goes down a bit. In scenes in which the creatures interact with the humans, it comes off as fake and cheesy. By itself, it is quite neat, but still not truly horrifying. I felt like they missed a chance with some tension in the audio department. It starts off nice, with an alarm alerting the town of danger, but after that we get things that are few and far between. For instance, while we are in the mist, to build tension we could have heard the creatures crawling around. For people at home it would be great with surround sound. The only instance I remember them doing this was in the pharmacy.<br/><br/>I like that we don't know for sure where these things came from, and the sci/fi element is a neat addition. If we were full blown told what these things were and where they came from it would ruin the ambiguity of the whole film. This film stands out for me because of the way it was shot, very surreal, hand held and in the moment. If everything were nicely panned and smooth flowing, it would feel to fake.<br/><br/>I have two gripes, which is why the film is rated lower then what this review if praising it for. One, for those who've seen it know where I am going, is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but you will either like it, or hate it. Which is ironic because I am on the fence with it. I applaud them for throwing a curve ball and showing us something that is so anti-Hollywood, but I felt cheated. You don't invest two plus hours into these characters and then pull off something like that. I called the ending....as a joke. I didn't expect it to be true. It's not really a twist, but what happens is shocking.<br/><br/>Second, the characters. I have never hated so many characters in one film. The Jesus freak stands out as one of my most hated characters in cinema history, right up there with Franklin from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I know she was suppose to be hated, but I just couldn't stand her at all. While watching the film, I put myself in some of the characters shoes and I would have never let that woman done half the stuff she did. Also, how do 90% of the people in there fall victim to her babble? I could understand some people following her, but with her reputation and the amount of hate people had for her it was too unrealistic to see so many do her bidding. Whatever happened to people banding together to defeat evil, not turn on each other. Are we as humans so disgusting that when we are thrown into danger we kill one another. That isn't what America would have you believe, especially after the 9/11 attacks. I literally got up out of my seat and cheered at one scene, which finally shut her up.<br/><br/>The Mist is a hard film to like all the way through, it pulls you in so many different directions that you feel uneasy about it as a whole. It is skillfully made and 2/3 of it is horror classic. Yet it doesn't fulfill what I wanted it to, which is a shame because I really liked it."
"JoeB131","1","6","14","27 March 2008"," Expiate the Weinsteins
","I was just wondering what would happen if a couple of Christian film makers produced a film where a Jewish character was portrayed as a hypocritical fanatic who was willing to kill people in a crisis and use the bible to justify it. I think we'd know what would happen. There would be unkind comparisons to Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, or worse, Mel Gibson (Gee, what happened to HIS career lately?) after which the aforementioned film makers would be run out of Hollywood on a rail.<br/><br/>Yet the Weinsteins can make a film portraying a Christian in such an evil and cartoonish way, and it's perfectly acceptable.<br/><br/>That was just one of my problems with this film. The others are too numerous to list. First, there is the typical portrayal of small town folks as stupid bumpkins easily led and manipulated. They do the most illogical things in a crisis. No one ever thinks of turning on a radio or a TV and trying to find out how widespread the crisis is, or using a cell phone to try to call out.<br/><br/>Then there is the ending. I am going to tell you the ending in the hope you don't see this. After putting all of our sympathies with the few survivors who don't follow the Christian fanatic, they run out of gas in the mist, and choose to kill themselves rather than be killed by the monsters. Except when the protagonist survives, the army shows up and drives back the mist, meaning he killed his kid for nothing. Yes, the Weinsteins give one last flip of the bird to anyone who invested any sympathy to the heroes of the film.<br/><br/>Can't blame Steven King for that part, his ending actually was more upbeat, at least allowing the potential the heroes survived. <br/><br/>I have seen a lot of bad movies, made with a lot of heart and a little sloppiness. This is an expensive movie which insults its viewers."

I went in excited to see it since this has long been one of my favorite King stories, and figuring that a short story would leave plenty of room for accuracy in the movie. I was left very disappointed. Special effects were cartoonish at best. The filmography played like a made for TV movie (even included the obvious commercial breaks which really messes with continuity in my opinion). Last but not least, anyone who's actually read the story will be very angry with the plot changes. Definitely not worth paying to see in a theater, maybe barely worth the time it will take to watch it when it is released on regular television.

","After two masterful adaptations of Stephen King by Frank Darabont, I was a bit surprised to see him directing ""The Mist"", a story from the more ""classic"" line of King's novels. I wasn't sure what to expect: the wonderful stories of ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Green Mile"", or the flops of many other adaptations. The greatest trouble with the film is that we get both. I expected great character-development from Darabont, but he gave us only bits and pieces, as if never really clear of what his purpose was: making a classic, scary horror or a drama about the people involved in unexpected and terrifying situations. The dramatic scenes were solid, the actors (part underused, somehow plane and uninteresting, except the wonderful Marcia Gay Harden) did their job well, the tension expected was there. Not much going wrong with the horror as well, although nothing out of the ordinary. Good effects, good scares, but most from the ""I've seen it all before"" category. BUT...scenes changed without any consistency between the two styles, they hardly managed to connect to make the movie a whole, resulting in a constant confusion of events expected to come. Don't misunderstand me, I like to guess at times, as a matter of fact I like when a movie doesn't tell me everything, allowing my imagination to work, but here it was like parts of the film were simply cut out to reduce it to an acceptable runtime. Well, maybe that was what happened. All in all, ""The Mist"" is not a bad movie, and is definitely one of the better based on a Stephen King novel. As a Frank Darabont piece though is below par, not rising to the expectations, destroyed by a cynical ending, that tries to amplify the drama, the tragedy of the heroes, but falls way over the top. Anyway, by then I didn't really care all that much about them. Worth watching once, but nothing more than maybe a 6 out of 10."
"Nightman85","10","5","11","6 March 2009"," A bold and powerful horror film, a must for King fans!
","Over the years Stephen King's shorter works (his short stories and novellas) haven't always made for the best big screen adaptations. Recently however King's works have been done some good justice (this year's 1408 being a fine addition) and now this stunning film version of King's novella The Mist, which may just be the best and brightest King-based film in many a day.<br/><br/>Following a violent storm, several residence of a small Maine town head off to the local grocery market where they find themselves trapped by a massive cloud of mist. As fear and paranoid grow among the locals it soon becomes evident that monstrous creatures lurk outside, but that's not the only threat. <br/><br/>The Mist is one fantastic tale of unknown terrors and human evil. Director-screen writer Frank Darabont does an excellent job of capturing the chilling effectiveness of the novella. Not only is the film pretty faithful to the original story, it also adds some effective elements of it's own, such as a jaw dropping conclusion to what was originally an open-ended story. The creature FX are gruesomely well done, the suspense and claustrophobia are quite intense, and Darabont's documentary-type camera work makes the film all the more realistic. There's also some great doses of sweat-inducing action to be had. Adding even more to the story are the well-drawn and heart felt characters, which make the film's bold climax all the more powerful.<br/><br/>The cast is quite good. Thomas Jane is endearing as our unfortunate hero, Marcia Gay Harden is a chilling villain as the religious fanatic, and Laurie Holden is solid as a new-comer to town. Toby Jones, William Sadler, Frances Sternhagen, and young Nathan Gamble round out a great supporting cast.<br/><br/>All around The Mist is a fine horror film. It isn't a schlocky, clichéd, or pretentious popcorn scare fest, but an intelligent and deadly serious journey that possesses far more than just gore and shock. It has genuine depth and that alone puts it above most modern genre movies.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","About 30 minutes into the new horror film ""The Mist,"" you begin to wonder if writer/director Frank Darabont was ever hugged as a child.<br/><br/>By the time the closing credits start to roll, you've substituted ""hugged"" for ""regularly placed into a burlap bag and beaten."" In a way, ""The Mist"" is something both extremely familiar and entirely different for Darabont, who made his directorial debut in 1994 with a little movie called ""The Shawshank Redemption."" By following up with the excellent ""The Green Mile"" in 1999, Darabont had established himself not only as a great screenwriter and director of hope-filled, dramatic period-prison films, but as one of very few people to ever faithfully adapt a story by Stephen King, let alone two, with great success.<br/><br/>But although neither of these eloquently composed films is without its moments of sheer brutality, let's just say that there are certain things in ""The Mist"" that make The Sisters and ""Wild Bill"" Wharton look about as threatening as Mr. Rogers or Bob Ross.<br/><br/>That's not to say Darabont's third King adaptation, this one a straight-up jarring horror film laced with multiple throwbacks to the cheesily tentacled B-level monster flicks of years past, lacks any great performances, artistic merit or social relevance. It's absolutely filled with them.<br/><br/>But just as importantly, ""The Mist,"" along with this summer's ""1408""itself based on a King novellaproves that Hollywood horror is not only limited to ""torture porn"" or the remaking of genre classics. A little thought-provoking originality, along with some disturbing, realistic psychological and sociological terror, can cut an audience much deeper than simply relying on gruesome violence or scantily clad young teens in peril to do the job.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is as much about religious fanaticism and the hysteria-induced evil that humans are capable of harboring when frightened and without technology than the bloodthirsty contents of a widespread fog that rapidly approaches a small Maine town. After enduring a violent overnight thunderstorm, David Drayton (Thomas Jane, in a far, yet exceptional cry from his ""Punisher"" days), his young son (Nathan Gamble) and neighbor, Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), drive to the crowded town supermarket to stock up on food and supplies. Once there, a local man bursts screaming into the store, his clothes bloodied, claiming that something hidden in the impending mist has ""taken"" people.<br/><br/>The townspeople quickly realize that the supermarket is suddenly engulfed entirely in whiteness, and the doors are immediately sealed. Over time, three opposing factions begin to form within the store: a group headed by paternally protective David and store supervisor Ollie (Toby Jones), attempting to find a safe way to escape; one led by the rationalist Norton who rejects the hoopla and wants to venture outside to search for help; and a steadily growing huddle influenced by the ramblings of a fanatic, Bible-quoting doomsayer (the freaky Marcia Gay Harden).<br/><br/>Of course, Darabont wants us to question which is more dangerous: terrified humans with no answers blindly following a ridiculous solution that only complicates matters, or the otherworldly beasts that wait beyond the store's glass windows. The film is extremely effective in evoking a strong sense of claustrophobia, and a great deal of that can be attributed to Darabont's decision to hire the filming crew of TV's ""The Shield,"" specializing in grittiness and hand-held camera-work. His choice to keep the monsters mostly hidden until we least expect it is also instrumental in the film's effectiveness.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" makes troubling events all the more devastating by drawing us into the lives of its characters and emphasizing their humanity, only to rip our hearts out during its subsequent brutal scenes. The much needed comic relief is valuable.<br/><br/>Many audiences have been polarized by the film's ending, unexpected, ironic and unflinching. I thought it was brilliant, staying with you long after the lights come up and serving as a great capper to the boiling pot of suspense Darabont had established throughout the film.<br/><br/>***.5 out of ****"

","In The Mist a thick layer of mist descends on a small town trapping some locals in a large food store. They quickly find out that there are monsters lurking in the mist and as always with survival horror the humans turn out to be just as dangerous as the creatures outside.<br/><br/>The Mist is a simple story but it's told really well and even pulls out a surprising and thought provoking ending. This is the kind of horror movie they used to make before they realised most teens will sit and watch just about anything and a few blaring noises will make a cheap substitute for real scares.<br/><br/>I really loved this movie, it's not really scary but the characters are interesting and the different monsters they encounter are great. One of the best horror movies I've seen in a really long time."
"paula_78","2","5","11","6 May 2008"," What a piece of crap
","This is such a B class movie -but pretending to be much more-, very cheap, lousy script. Probably the worst Thomas Jane performance, who has a very poor character, very disappointing. Everything is so obvious. Anyway, you know nothing good is coming when you see the first tentacle, and I hasn't many expectations of this, that's the worst. The only good thing, I have to admit, was Marcia Gay Harden performance, very intense and believable. None of the characters are developed in any way, and the explanation of this weir mist, that makes all the action take place, last a line at much and it's the greatest clichés of all. Don't waste your time with this fiasco, if you enjoy the genre go watch John Carpenter's The Fog, a real master piece."
"lual","10","5","11","14 April 2008"," One of the best horror movies of all time
","Note: I have added the ""spoiler notice"", even though I will not reveal the ending. I will mention its impact on me, though, which, for some, might already count as a spoiler.<br/><br/>It is so difficult to get a horror movie right. Quite often, in my opinion, the idea of the horror subject is more frightening than the execution. This applies especially to haunted house stories. But here.... I have to confess, I have rarely ever felt horror as strongly as I did while watching this movie.<br/><br/>I haven't read the novella on which the movie is based, but after watching the movie I listened to a radio dramatization and read some stuff on the net and from that I gather that the movie follows the story pretty closely, mostly deviating from it at the end by adding a coda.<br/><br/>The story starts quickly, driving the plot forward and the tension builds up gradually. What I really like about the movie is that while there is the ""attack - pause - attack - pause""-rhythm that is typical for horror movies, there is no denouement here in the pauses. While the monsters ""plan"" their next attack, it is the humans who drive the action further and in many ways, the story that unfolds here is much more frightening than the monster attacks. The monster stuff is there for the blood and gore, the human story provides the real terror that leaves you chilled. It is this rare combination of different kinds of horror that makes this movie stand out so much.<br/><br/>The characters are also completely believable. There is only one scene in which a character seems to react the way he does because of the genre conventions. This is when Mr. Norton strictly refuses to go back to the warehouse to look at the remains of a monster. I felt this to be the only forced moment in the movie where the reaction was not natural, but had to be like this to keep the movie and the tension going.<br/><br/>Mrs. Carmody is a pretty risky character that could easily have gone wrong. But with this script and especially through the outstanding performance of Marcia Gay Harden she remains credible and real. I can't believe how many people view this as bashing of religion or Christianity. Mrs. Carmody in my opinion is not a symbol of religion but of orthodoxy and radicalness. If a Christian is offended by her portrayal, I think he should probably check his own motives.<br/><br/>Now, for the ending... What an incredible, courageous, terrifying, ruthless ending. When I watched the movie in the theater I couldn't believe what I was watching. This ending, while it is just the icing on the cake, is what will make this film be remembered for a long time. I can completely understand why people hate this ending. It goes against movie conventions (if you haven't seen the movie: don't worry, it is not an open ending, the story gets completely resolved) and will crush you on the floor without picking you up. This part you will have to do on your own. The point is, that this is not just a sad ending, but it stresses the unnecessarity of the actions the main character has taken. And by then giving us just a short look into the face of a woman who had taken a chance early on in the movie and was supposed to be dead but had instead survived, it makes everything even more unbearable.<br/><br/>Usually, when a hero dies in the end or something sad happens to him, there is always some sort of closure that what he did was right or that he was a hero of some sort. ""The Mist"" denies the viewer this feeling. Instead, it leaves us with a feeling of deep deep pain and uselessness. People who hate the ending and maybe feel betrayed by it, probably mostly hate the fact that they have been lured into identifying with the supposedly wrong character. This guy is not an everyman who goes out of the story with his head held high, but one who makes a mistake, an understandable mistake, that will ruin him forever.<br/><br/>A great movie!"

","After a horrific storm that came out of no where a mist rolls into a strip mall where residents are stocking up on goods to tide them over until the power comes on. Unfortunately there is something (actually things) in the mist and they are hungry.<br/><br/>One of the most profoundly disturbing horror films I've ever seen. I'm shaking all over. This is a masterpiece of visceral horror. Its black as night with almost no hope. As the film progresses people turn on each other, egged on by Marsha Gay Harden as a religious zealot. Its a frightening thing.<br/><br/>The fear and terror comes not so much what we are seeing (frankly I really wish that there had been less CGI since its a little too clear at times its not real) rather from the oppressive mood thats created. There is a minimal use of music so its just the sounds of the people and the mist and nothing to block it out. The scary scenes are not the way cool monsters its the lack of monsters, its when nothing is happening or when people are fighting or simply discussing. Who needs to see the things that go bump in the night? Not perfect, the film still shakes you up. It left me profoundly disturbed and uneasy.<br/><br/>See this film if you want to be shaken at your core.<br/><br/>And yes the ending has been changed from the story. The ending is a black as any American film I've ever seen. Even if you can guess the end it will still leave you shaken."
"bumbletbw","10","5","11","11 December 2007"," The Kind of Excellence You Should Expect
","Yet another King/Darabont collaboration. If you've seen the trailers, then you know the premise. A mist encompasses a small Maine town containing hordes of unknown, man-eating beasties. We follow a supermarket full of people as they try to deal with the situation. That's all the set-up you need. <br/><br/>This is the best film in theatres that no one is talking about. After having been out for three weekends, it has yet to crack the top 5 in the US box office. Amateur and professional critics alike are undeservedly pegging this film as a monster movie. Yes, there are monsters in this movie, but this bill of fare is not simply cheap schlock. There is much more going on here than cheap scares and flesh-ripping gore, and from what I can tell, that seems to be the biggest complaint. <br/><br/>""The monsters aren't scary enough,"" ""The special effects don't look good."" ""I didn't like the ending, it's depressing.""<br/><br/>That's the difference between this film and the bubble-gum horror that audiences have been subject to and come to expect from the genre for far too long. This movie isn't about the gore, it doesn't need cheap scares and squirms to frighten the audience. This isn't Saw. It doesn't need hyper-realistic CGI monsters to be frightening. That isn't what is supposed to scare you. It's fluff.<br/><br/>This movie is about the demons within mankind. Sure that sounds trite and at times it is, but that doesn't negate the fact that it's still a true and effective theme in literature and film. This movie is about what fear can do to the Average Joe when there is no one to enforce the rule of law. This movie is Lord of the Flies in a supermarket with a backdrop of Lovecraftian paranormality. That's why it's so effective. You could change the venue and the outside threat and this story would remain as poignant and powerful as ever. This is the kind of social commentary that is especially pervasive and effective in this genre of film and literature. This story ranks with Planet of the Apes and Fahrenheit 451 and I think it will be remembered with a similar fondness for a long time to come.<br/><br/>Forget the imaginary monsters on the outside. Be scared of the very real monsters on the inside.<br/><br/>This is the best new film I've seen in years. Go see it."
"srelf2","9","5","11","1 December 2007"," An Allegory for Our Times
","This movie was INTENSE! And, a very important allegory in this time of fear which has lead to the use of torture, loss of civil liberties, paranoia, mistrust of neighbors, resorting to cruelty and violence, misuse of science, misuse of military authority, perversion of religion, distrust of the outsider, etc. Stuff we really have to deal with as a society now or go under. It's a clarion call in the guise of a horror flick. Yeah, the special effects weren't always top-notch (even though some of it was pretty original and effective), and there were a few events that didn't quite work, so I gave it a 9. But it's a solid 9!<br/><br/>But it is also great in its picture of human courage and cowardice, and character rising to the occasion. On the other hand, the sheep-like character displayed by a good number of the survivors was true to human nature as well. The question the movie sticks in your face is: Which side would you be on? And, are your so sure about that? SPOILER FOLLOWS - Classical drama calls for a hero that is flawed, and certainly the main character is flawed. That is what makes him human at the same time. That the rescue may not come in time makes this movie's ending depart from the bedtime story quality of flicks like ""War of the Worlds"". It is absolutely the case that in survival situations one may lose hope after going through hell and having the rug pulled out from under what you thought was your last resort. The ending serves as a lesson about not losing hope as others have stated here, and as a wakeup call."
"gburkholder","6","5","11","29 November 2007"," Major Disappointment
","I have been reading Stephen King's works for the past 20 years. I first encountered ""The Mist"" in the early 90's and always considered it the finest of his ""too long for a short story"" group of writings. I love the depth and complexity of the characters in the story. Needless to say I have been highly anticipating the release of ""The Mist"" movie, especially after I heard that Frank Darabont was adapting and directing. His work on Shawshank and the Green Mile are by far my two favorite adaptations of King's works, I would even go so far as to say that the Shawshank movie is superior to the written work. For the first two hours I was pleased with the overall effort of the movie, it was both entertaining and frightening and stuck to King's basic plot. This is when the Mist ran out of gas for me both in 4X4 the main characters were riding in and my desire to ever watch this movie again. The decision for David Drayton to end all four of his traveling companions lives without much (onscreen at least) discussion or debate not only seems out character for the five passengers in the vehicle, as all seemed to be the strong willed survivor types who never gave up. To see them meekly shrug their shoulders and seemingly say ""what else can we do"" is just wrong. The book's ending left us hope that these hard fighting characters could be saved. The movie's hope was blown away with four gunshots designed to shock the audience, but in opinion the shots just killed the movie."

It makes you see people for what they are really capable of given whatever circumstances are at hand. This movie has haunted me for three days now and I cannot stop thinking about it. Stephen King really outdid his self this time. The idea of not knowing what is out in the Mist and not knowing if you are gonna survive is haunting enough, then throw the psychological things in the mix and you have one terrifying story. This movie sends chills up your spine and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. There is one scene with spiders, (giant spiders) and I thought I would pass out it was so awful. King doesn't discriminate, no matter who you are the creatures may get you. That makes this movie even scarier!! See this movie, just don't go home alone afterward!!!"

","Frank Darabont has created a horror film that will send shivers down your spine. This is what great horror ought to be- a film riveting with allegory and yet containing a visceral sense of terror all throughout the run time. Darabont deserves the tag of being an underrated filmmaker with a penchant for Stephen King's works, and The Mist is one of the finest of his works. The story concerns a small town that gets engulfed in a strange mist of some kind. In the mist are strange creatures that bite. The town gets trapped inside a mall as the creatures wreak havoc. The horror is straightforward, and it is a credit to Darabont's talent that we are totally engrossed in what is happening to the characters trapped in their own city. Some scenes are awe inspiring and I won't say anything else. If you enjoy horror films, if you enjoy well made horror films with allegorical themes- you should not miss The Mist. This is great horror filmmaking. This is great cinema."

"butterman_1999","9","2","3","26 June 2019"," Easily one of the best King adaptations
","I am certain the numerous reviews on this site have all explored and expanded on the various elements of this film, both narratively and thematically, and so I will not waste anyone's time re-hashing words of praise or views of criticisms.<br/><br/>Darabont's third forray into adapting a King story (in this case, a novella) also seems to hit a home run. With his own screenwriting adaptation of the source material as well as the abilityu to have kept the original ending he wanted without succumbing to production and studio pressures to make it more ""Hollywoodesque"" and thus appeal to a larger demographic of common moviegoers, Darabont has indeed created a tale which I myself can only describe as true horror.<br/><br/>Yes, horror has all too many faces, from constantly re-booting teen slashers to marathon speed running zombies, all the way to the mutant killer fish shark dinosaur hybrids and everything under the sun (and the moon!), horror has been established as a garanteed cash-in for producers, quick to send into production the next carbon-copy of a remake of a plageirzsed idea in order to get a quick profit during slow blockbuster weekend gross profits.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD - READ ONWARDS AT YOUR OWN, well, spoilers!<br/><br/>While the majority of the film obviously plays in the horror vein of ""killer monsters"" lurking outside in the mist, it also explores another thematic often favored in horror, and that is the concept of isolationism. Humans trapped in a confined area are bound to turn on one another, as as one character ever says in the film itself ""put more than 2 people in a room and sides are being taken"". This added threat is also an added layer of terror as now the protagonists are struggling for survival not only from the external menace, but the one created within their own confinment.<br/><br/>However the true horror is revealed during the final moments of the film, the final moments of the last act, and the infamous ending no one wanted to be filmed, but which is perhaps both the only real solution in a scenario which has played out the way it did during the course of the film, and one which truly changes this film from a very, very good horror film into a ""real"" horror film. I will admit I both weeped and clapped while sitting in the comfort of our living room.<br/><br/>END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS------------------you are sfae now!<br/><br/>My rating is literally between an 8 and a 9 out of 10. Since there can only ever really be one true ""10"" out of ""10"" (i.e. a total masterpiece), and this film has very little noticeable flawsit really cranks up there amongst the best of the best for sheer audacity.<br/><br/>I do advise that this film is not for everyone. I am almost willing to claim that this film will alienate someone, somewhere, as numerous questions about self survival, sacrifice, and self preservation from a variety of perspectives will not be pleasing for every/any one to watch."

This comes as no surprise as Darabont is also the writer for the latter. <br/><br/>As much as The Walking Deads boorish drama dragged down many of the seasons- this isn't much different.

"jdhb-768-61234","9","2","3","13 November 2017"," Where are the real monsters ?
","'The Mist' is a really surprising film, one that is tense and horrific without having the usual gallons of blood and gore. Yes, there is some blood and some gore, but a good part of the film is taken up with watching the way in which a group of people trapped in a store react to their situation. Most are terrified, some find God, but others refuse to believe that there's actually any danger. The mysterious mist that surrounds the store hides who knows what ? <br/><br/>As the film progresses, the tension rises. Some of the people decide to chance their arm and venture out; their fates vary. Others are influenced by a religious fanatic who gradually convinces them that the mist, and whatever it contains, is God's work and turns them against the 'non-believers'; violence ensues and one begins to wonder whether those inside the store are just as monstrous as what lies outside. The discovery of the origin of the mist adds yet another element to the story.<br/><br/>The film limits the use of background music and also of special effects. Some nasty creatures do appear but a good part of the horror is due to not seeing too much, just the results of interaction between people and the hidden monsters and knowing that something very nasty lurks in that all-pervading mist.<br/><br/>This a very good horror film, one of the best I've ever seen, and its ending is probably as shocking as that of any film ever made; as realisation of the truth dawns, it becomes truly heartbreaking. It's a well earned 9 that will keep most viewers pinned to their seats and some hiding behind the sofa."
"tiskec","7","2","3","13 November 2016"," Mystified of the Mist
","This is one of Stephen King's better movie adaptations. I enjoyed the movie a lot. There was just one thing that boggled my mind. How did the woman that walked off from the store, in the beginning, come across the United States army without being killed? Also, why didn't she tell the Army about the people that were trapped in this grocery store? This just doesn't sit right with me at all. What a b*tch hey?<br/><br/>This brings me to my outlook of the movie. A man and his boy, take a trip to the market with their pain-in-the-ass lawyer neighbor, to compensate him for damage caused by the property. When they get there, this mist covers everything. They can't see five feet in front of them. Literally, it's that thick. The power eventually goes out in this store, and they head for the generator, which seems to be clogged from the roof. When they get to the back room, this teenager's testosterone filled idiocy, thinks it's a great idea to go out into the mist and unclog the generator on the roof. Well, without telling you the juicy parts, lets just say the mist is filled with giant insects; yes they're huge. They sprung loose from a dimensional portal the military was experimenting with on the mountain, and it leaked onto the town. Some of these poisonous bugs gave me the eebie-jeebies. Man. Especially when this nest of spiders hatches inside this guy in a pharmacy they eventually venture to for antibiotics. <br/><br/>As I said earlier, this lady decides to just up and walk out of the store. She had to get back to her child, and asked if any gentleman could escort her. Nobody did, so she just ventures off and disappears in the mist. Then you don't hear, or see, her throughout the whole movie, until the end. She apparently was lucky enough to run into the U.S. Army, and they collected her and kept her safe. I still don't know why she didn't tell them about the people trapped in the market. Maybe it was revenge, or because she interpreted that everyone only thought of themselves or didn't care? I don't know. Without giving away the ending, she is seen by one guy from the market in the end among a bunch of U.S. Army soldiers. The look he gave her is just full of dread. He couldn't believe it. <br/><br/>I really liked the dialog in this movie. It's one of the more realistic in King's movies. The movie isn't rushed, and besides for a couple, most of the decisions argued among the characters is logical. --""Those of you who actually want to do something about this, let's work together. Those of you who want to stay and stack dog food..well."" <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie for a one time watch to those who enjoy horror/suspense. I really liked it."
"paul_haakonsen","7","2","3","6 March 2016"," There is something in the mist...
","This is actually one of the better Stephen King novella adaptations to make it to the screen. And for me it is because ""The Mist"" is so heavily influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft to the very core.<br/><br/>What works out so well in ""The Mist"" is the build up of suspense that director Frank Darabont managed to establish and the slowly unveiling of what is going on and what is lurking in the mysterious mist that engulf the town.<br/><br/>Granted I haven't read the book, so I have no idea how close Frank Darabont stayed to the original work. But whether or not he stayed true to the book or strayed from the it, it hardly matters, as this is an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Without going too much into details about the storyline, then ""The Mist"" is about a group of people getting trapped in a supermarket as a mist swallows up the town, and unseen horrors are lurking in the mist, killing anyone who ventures into the haze.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie were quite good, well-detailed and carved out with personalities and differences. And it is the combination of this good character gallery and the talents portraying the characters that make for a memorable movie experience. Thomas Jane carried the movie quite well, but most impressive was Marcia Gay Harden in her role. Laurie Holden, Andre Braugher, Toby Jones, Jeffrey DeMunn and Frances Sternhagen also really added a lot to the movie.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is not the type of horror movie that will leave you scared senseless, nor is it one that will have you jumping out of the chair every so often. No, this is the type of horror movie that runs on suspense and build-up.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie were quite good and added a good amount of believability to the movie. The creature designs were quite good and very realistic, well in the scenes that they appeared to be real. However, the tentacles that assaulted the supermarket, well they could have been re-touched, because they were quite poor compared to the rest of the CGI throughout the movie.<br/><br/>All in all then ""The Mist"" is a good horror movie that has a good story, good characters, good action, good effects and a good hold on the audience. The ending to the movie, despite being corny, was a nice touch."
"estebangonzalez10","7","2","3","29 June 2015"," Darabont and King reunited once again.
","""You don't have much faith in humanity, do you?""<br/><br/>Frank Darabont's third adaptation of a Stephen King novel proves without a doubt that he is the best director at bringing the writer's words to film. The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile were both fantastic films, although not the typical horror novels you'd expect from King. The Mist however is much closer to the horror genre we'd expect from him, and Darabont manages to successfully adapt his work for the third time. Not that there haven't been other successful King adaptations from other director's such as Kubrick's direction in The Shining, Reiner in Misery and Stand By Me, and De Palma in Carrie, but most of the time the adaptations don't seem to work as well. But when it comes to Frank Darabont he has always managed to impress us with the way he brings those novels to the big screen. I honestly have no idea why I never got around to watching this film considering how much I loved Darabont's previous work, but I think much of it had to do with my confusion over the 2005 film The Fog. The name of that film was translated in Spanish as ""The Niebla"" which was the same name they gave The Mist so I thought I had seen this film before and hated it. When I finally realized these were two separate films I decided to watch it and what a pleasant experience it was. The Mist is a fantastic homage to 50 and 60's monster horror films, but at the same time Darabont seems to be reminding us that no matter how dangerous and ugly these things might be, the true enemy is our own humanity. No matter how much fun the ride was, the ending is what will really stick with you. You will love it and hate it at the same time. <br/><br/>David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is an artist who is working on his latest Hollywood poster painting from his comfortable home in Maine. He is unexpectedly interrupted by a storm and quickly seeks refugee in the basement with his wife and five year-old son, Billy (Nathan Gamble). The next morning they see the damage the fallen trees have left on their home and along with his son and their neighbor Brent (Andre Braugher) they head to the market to buy supplies. There is a heavy mist that seems to be approaching and while they are on their way to the market several firetrucks and army vehicles seem to be heading towards the opposite direction. Once they arrive at the supermarket the mist has already caught up to them and a few minutes later an old man named Dan (Jeffrey DeMunn) runs in half scared to death claiming that there is something in the mist taking people. There are more than 50 people in the market who begin to panic and they decide to close the doors and wait inside for help. David decides to check the generator along with some of the men there including a store employee named Ollie (Toby Jones) and a client named Jim (William Sadler) but what they experience leaves them completely horrified. Some sort of gigantic creature's tentacles begin to slide under the loading dock door and the men immediately have to shut it. There is no doubt in their minds now that there is definitely something out of this world in the mist. According to Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), the town's religious fanatic, they are all experiencing God's wrath for their sinful nature. At first no one pays attention to her, but as the strange creatures begin to creep into the store, she begins to have more followers. David will not only have to look out for what is terrorizing them from the outside, but worry about the growing hate that Mrs. Carmody is sowing in everyone's hearts. <br/><br/>In a way, The Mist is sort of The Walking Dead reunion since there are three actors from that series (Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Melissa McBride) in this film. It comes as no surprise since Darabont is one of the producers and directors of that series as well and DeMunn has always worked with him in his other King adaptations. If you are a fan of that series, you will definitely want to check this film out because there could be a clue as to how that series might end. Darabont always has a surprise in store and he is deeply influenced by his good friend Stephen King so you know you can't expect a clichéd finale. As much as I enjoyed this film I did feel that the two hour length was a bit tiresome at some points. The film could've been cut a good 20 minutes and the experience could've been much better. The Marcia Gay Harden character also got on my nerves and I think they gave her too much screen time. The religious fanatic element was an important plot point but Darabont emphasized it a bit too much. The Mist is still a lot of fun and it delivers several suspenseful moments. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","The movie is pretty good until the end, where the director deviates from the book and felt the need to have an edgier (more depressing) ending, where the book ending would have been fine. If you don't want to be depressed at the end, stop watching it at the point where they start driving thru the fog. That's where the book ends, and should have been where the movie ends.<br/><br/>I guess I have to write 10 lines. The group trapped in the store contains a bunch of typical King characters, mind-gaming the others to turn on the group who ""brought this on us all"".

So much for Stephen King's work. I won't spoil the ending (though you may wish I had). It left me angry. (I know, ""it's just a movie."") It was totally painful to watch.

","Stephen King's novella of the same title gets a decent adaptation in ""The Mist."" After a strong storm, a large mist quickly surrounds a town, trapping dozens of people in a supermarket. Terrifying creatures roam within the mist, hunting and killing anyone who ventures outside. But danger also lurks within the refuge of the supermarket. As the hours slowly tick by, the people form opinions on what is happening and how to survive it. Three separate groups start to form, and one will overpower the others, ushering in a new level of violence and bloodshed that will rival the horrors within the mist.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Mist"" is the scene when 5 survivors trapped in a vehicle make a shocking decision. More on this below.<br/><br/>I have read the novella and thought it a brilliant piece of writing. But the movie version is...far from brilliant. Two things prevented it from being great. First: Thomas Jane is completely wrong for the part of the main character. His superhero looks had no place in this story. The main character was a regular person forced to do extraordinary things under a tremendous amount of pressure and fear. Jane was completely out of his element as he wasn't believable at all when he tried to look afraid. I was expecting him to suddenly walk around with his Punisher shirt on, blasting the creatures with a large, automatic rifle and saving the whole world. Second: the ending. I understand some of the logic that went to the decision that was made in the vehicle; but there was another option. And the aftermath of that decision? Depending on your values and point of view, you will either be horrified and stunned, or start to laugh. And the fact that the ending can produce laughter tells me that it was the wrong ending to put in this movie.<br/><br/>The creatures were great though.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoment"

","The novella had been noted numerous times when discussing the inspiration for many titles in the industry, I had no interest in watching this film until many regarded this film to have the most depressing/disturbing ending.<br/><br/>Being one who finds interest in being disturbed/depressed, I was intrigued to watch this film.<br/><br/>The film displayed its quality through its cinematography and camera-work, which was very note-worthy. However, this aspect diminishes as the first act ends.<br/><br/>The first issue I noticed was the acting and casting choices, I'm fed up with big Hollywood films always choosing the 'hottest' actors to play the most mundane roles. And that proved to be a great offender for this film.<br/><br/>The acting for the majority of the film is terrible, the only exception being Toby Jones's performance which fit his role. Every actor didn't display much emotion in their face especially when in the most deepest emotions a human could be.<br/><br/>The visuals are very bland, the typical Horror colours are utilised. Although the biggest drawback to this aspect are the CGI effects, which aren't convincing and look abysmal. Some of the CGI effects don't include any lighting to blend the CGI in with the environment, leaving the effects to appear non-existent in the scene.<br/><br/>There are a few practical effects that look convincing, however they're barely in the film, and become very noticeable due to the terrible contrast between the CGI and practical effects.<br/><br/>The biggest offender to me is the script, the characters have barely any character development, so your investment and care in them are nearly non-existent. In addition to this, these characters make the most inhuman decisions they could possibly make in the context the film displays to us.<br/><br/>All of these aspects helped create a dumb Hollywood film that was unintentionally entertaining, the dumb decisions and actions that took place in these scenarios made the film hilarious and annoyingly dumb. The stale, unrealistic, and synthetic acting ensured hilarity in the scenes that attempted relate-ability and emotion.<br/><br/>However, despite the overwhelming amount of problems the film redeems some of its problems with its twist ending, the music and tone is perfect for the situation. The ending was what saved this film from being an unintentionally hilarious Hollywood horror."

"gondogeorg","1","13","39","15 March 2008"," Definitely one of the worst ""serious"" horror movies ever!
","Just watched this crap of a movie and I must admit that even the loads of bad reviews that the film has received so far are not enough to describe this miserable piece of cinema.<br/><br/>All of the lead characters are exceptionally annoying. First of Grayden, played by pretty boy Thomas Jane. An artist, who turns out to be the ""sheep"" leader of the caged supermarket customers, who people follow without a doubt.....After a while his leadership is overtaken by an even more annoying religious zealot, who manages to convert all these farmer idiots to kneel down and pray to god for mercy, since the day of judgement has arrived. She even convinces the crowd to kill an innocent soldier, who admits that the military has somehow opened a door to another dimension, which is used by all these monsters (which were not original at all!. Unfortunately, we never get the chance to understand how and why this happened. The rest of the cast is also annoying, not just the acting, but the way they handle or react in certain situations (probably the script is responsible for that). <br/><br/>A few scenes to explain you my concerns:<br/><br/>1) Why does it seem to me during the whole movie that Grayden considers to have an affair with that blonde chick, when he represents at the same time the honest and righteous hero??? Because he knows his wife has died in the mist anyways???<br/><br/>2) How stupid can the black guy be and not check if the chopped off tentacle does in fact really exist? Instead he is suspicious against Grayden and swears the hell out on him, although they just seemed to get a long pretty well 5 minutes earlier.<br/><br/>3)Why did the Tentacle Monster in the beginning not just smash the windows instead of trying to enter from the back by hitting against a massive garage door.<br/><br/>4)Why does the giant bug not sting the religious zealot, but just crawls up her breasts, looks her in the eyes and decides not to??? Does it mean the fury is right and her ""deep"" connection to god saves her from these beasts?<br/><br/>5)Why do they stay in the pharmacy, stare at and kill these endless number of spiders, when they could instead just run back to the supermarket.<br/><br/>6)Why does the annoying son and the blond chick suffer a hysterical attack when Grayden just grabs the pistol from his trunk, which takes 3 seconds??? It seems as if they think he would just get it to shoot both their heads off.....(which he actually does in the end - see later)<br/><br/>7)Same scene....Why does he wait until the spider crawls all over the car and not just starts the engine, accelerates and therefore kicks the spider off the car. And why does the spider actually run all over but doesn't attack?!<br/><br/>8)OF course the scene at the end. How could Grayden possibly be that irrational and kill all the passengers including his OWN SON!!! Any sane person would wait and hope that the misery might dissolve, but no: He cannot wait to get rid of the people. Well, maybe he did the right thing in the end, since therefore this miserable movie came finally to an end.<br/><br/>9)The choral music/chant during the last 10 minutes of the movie was also totally inappropriate. That kind of music is OK for an epic historic movie, but not for a horror movie without any depth or message at all.<br/><br/>10)And why the hell would a producer finance a director to film such a piece of ....<br/><br/>Sorry, that is my honest opinion and it seems I am not the only one who thinks like that"

The opening scene on the lake is a film-killer - horrible location. Check out that BUSY highway bridge in the background.

The acting is atrocious - cartoonish.<br/><br/>King fans, like myself, have waited years for this adaptation.

And to think that ignorant people will walk away from the movie and actually believe that is an accurate representation. It should have been called, ""Stephen King's Warped View of Reality."" And after being subjected to over an hour of ridiculous proselytizing, I am shown what I take to be some sort of shock value ending as if that will erase the whole first hour and fifteen minutes. Was that supposed to be suspenseful? The only suspense I received was wondering what kind of crazy bullsh*t the ""christian"" was going to do next.

Nah, actually that would be way too entertaining for a good analogy, and certainly far more intelligent. And with better dialogue.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief usually takes a good ass-pounding by Hollywood horror movies, but here you have to not only watch a whole grocery store full of idiots behaving in the most implausible ways imaginable (or unimaginable), but you get the added bonus of them being the most spectacular collection of annoying, detestable character clichés ever assembled on screen. Oh yeah, you ALSO get to have them speaking with those quaint Stephen King-trademarked rural Maine colloquialisms that have become soooooo FRIGGING worn out it makes you wish you could travel back in time to convince Doubleday to NOT publish ""Carrie.""<br/><br/>Most of the time if I disagree with someone about a movie, it's c'est la viewe all have our secret shames of bad movies that we just like for some reason. But The Mist was so moronic, so vacuous, so insultingly devoid of logic or believability in plot, dialogue, motivation, and character, that it's not enough to just criticize the movie. It needs to be personal.<br/><br/>A lot of people complain about the dismal ending. It actually made me cheer. Before the mist even finished rolling in I was rooting for the monsters. My only wish was that Frank Darabont and Stephen King were in the car too, and that there was an ABUNDANCE of ammo.<br/><br/>P.S. This movie getting a 7.6 on IMDb pretty much explains how complete dreck like Full House and Home Improvement ever lasted so long on TV, and how George W. managed to hang around long enough to doom the planet. <br/><br/>And in case the real twist of the movie escaped you, then here's the spoiler: the universe WE live in is THE ACTUAL horrifying ""alternate universe!""

","*SPOILERS PRESENT* This is by far one of the worst movies I've seen in some time. Stephen's King's liberal politics spills over into an atrocity of a film. The acting in the film is very good, and should be commended. However, the liberal left wing bias throughout the whole movie is palpable, and just downright disrespectful to the audience, it's so evident that while at the movie theater I could overhear several audience members vocalizing their disbelief at the political undertones. Stephen King makes an obvious attempt to place his political views into the film as characters, and stereotypes. He wrote the film to portray the 'locals' as a group of redneck hillbillies which are pawns to a lunatic Christian woman. Stephen King uses this stereotype to set the Christians as evil in the film, he works as hard as he can to make all of the Christians appear to be dimwitted, violent, and outright ignorant throughout the entire film. Furthermore, the political undertones continue on to the military with the blame falling on them, to which they are promptly ostracized and thrown into the mist. Stephen King wrote the film in a way to blame all of these problems on the military, and all of the problems internally in the grocery store on Christians. I don't consider myself to be a very politically minded person, and I have a pretty tough skin when it comes to Hollywood and it's politics, but in the end the movie was completely terrible, it lacked interested, it seemed to go nowhere, few questions were answered, and at the end I felt like the only thing I witnessed was Stephen King pandering politics. The movie has an absolutely abysmal conclusion which any 13 year old child could have concocted in 30 seconds just before the bell rang. All in all, the CGI is horrific, the writing/scripting is biased, and the entertainment value is poor. The good parts of the film lay with the actors, the film has excellent acting.. which is probably the only thing worthy of mention."

One can't help wondering if Jane was disappointed when he saw the final cut of The Mist -- I certainly was.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine how people will react in this kind of a fantasy situation, but one hopes they will do better than depicted in this film. The dialogue is as unnatural as the spooky things outside in the mist -- and just as inhuman. In fact, the dialogue was the scariest feature of the movie -- scary to know that professionals are getting paid to write this drivel.<br/><br/>The special effects were good, and the action scenes were exciting. Some characters' reactions to the extraordinary events were, however, simply foolish and laughable. You can always tell when dialogue is failing when the audience laughs at a point where they're not supposed to be laughing. This happens several times in the movie.<br/><br/>The film is not totally unwatchable, but you definitely won't be missing much if you skip it.

"Jeddia","10","5","12","23 November 2007"," Raises the bar for King adaptations
","One of King's most famous short stories is brought to the screen with all of its terror and humanity intact. Darabont, known for the dramas - Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile - has now raised the bar for adapting King's horror stories to the big screen.<br/><br/>The Mist is about two kinds of terror - that of the supernatural and that of the human capacity for primal regression in the face of ultimate fear. A group of small town folks trapped in a local food-mart when the mist rolls in try to survive. The terror outside, in the mist, becomes only one of the problems they face as those trapped inside turn to ""leaders"" who believe differently about what is happening. The result is an obvious homage to ""Lord of the Flies"", but suits its purpose in the horrifying landscape King creates.<br/><br/>Darabont handles the saturating sense of dread and despair with a deftness that has been embarrassingly absent in nearly all of the previous attempts to bring King's stories to film. What's absent in The Mist are the standard clichés, thin characters, and inexplicable human behavior that are prevalent in most horror films.<br/><br/>The script is nearly indistinguishable from the source material save for very small details, some minor modern updates (cell phones), and an added ending (the short story lacked any real ending). It works on every level for both the fans of King and those who are new.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. Way to go Frank!"

I'll leave that open.<br/><br/>So, a bit of simple logic: They would easily have survived if they weren't just that shockingly stupid... Let's compile a recipe for bad things happening in ""The Mist"": First, you have to ignore every warning there is and walk out into the mist to get your upper half separated from your lower half. Then you have to be stupid enough not to feel the tremendous amount of pain you experience by intense friction from a rope to your hands and just hold on to it (come on, he would have had blisters as big as his stupidity after that). Also, you do NOT IN ANY CASE separate the religious nut case scaring everyone from the rest of the group. It would just be impolite and we can't have that, can we? After that, what you do is absolutely NOT say anything having noticed that the insect-like creatures are drawn to the light while EVERYBODY is lighting every available lamp and lantern... Well, why would you? Lastly, after emptying the whole tank of a car getting away you just shoot everyone into the head because it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the car and continue on foot when everybody is still unharmed. So after mixing these ingredients and ingesting the whole thing all that's left is to go puke and forget about it as quickly as you can.<br/><br/>Luckily, the boy died young and didn't have to endure the stupidity of that town any longer.

","I've watched this movie a number of times now and enjoy it just as much each viewing. It has all the classic ingredients of a good horror: contained location, unknown protagonist, eclectic group of people. What makes this a stand out for me is that the horror is not necessarily what's outside in the mist, but what's inside the human heart: cowardice, stupidity, hopelessness. Also noticeable in this movie are the roles given to lesser known character actors who make the whole film very real and pertinent. In some ways, this is more an apocalyptic movie than a horror, as dystopian films and books tend to concentrate more on the impact of the breakdown of civilization within the human heart rather than just gore/slasher monsters. There are monsters in this film, but like the main characters, I'd rather take my chances in the mist with them than stay with the humans remaining in the safe zone. Another feature of this film that is easy to spot is that comes from a very good novella to start with (Stephen King). So many films have shed loads of money thrown at them but fail because of bad writing. I highly recommend this film for those who like their horror less gore and more thought provoking."

","""The Mist"" is more about human psychology than about monsters or aliens. Some of the graphics did seem B-grade, but the plot simply keeps you hooked on.<br/><br/>In many ways it is more interesting/disgusting (in an embarrassed) way to watch how even grown ups will react when put in real tight situations.<br/><br/>The fact that most of the movie is done in a local grocery store with little or no background music only adds to the eerie and lifelike atmosphere. <br/><br/>A part of the ending was guess-able, but the other wasn't and in many ways was indigestible.

","You know those cretinous B-movies that use the tired cliché of the irritating moron determined against all reason to visit the dark and spooky basement armed only with a broken flashlight and a screwdriver? Well this cretinous B-movie has a whole supermarket full of those morons.<br/><br/>Here the morons find themselves under threat from CGI bugs and giant CGI tentacles, which are reasonably convincing but are cleverly concealed by a mysterious smoke effect. And all of which are taller than knee height.<br/><br/>So our morons choose to barricade themselves in the vulnerable plate-glassed front of a small town food store using hundreds of bags of dog-food piled up to knee height from where they signal their presence to those waiting CGI monsters by the waving of flashlights and the shining of powerful arc lamps.<br/><br/>The convenience of so very many bags of dog food can only be explained by the total absence of dogs.<br/><br/>At the back of the store there is a loading bay with a solid roller-door in which they could more securely have barricaded themselves, but unfortunately this area had already been used as a plot device for a clichéd moron with a broken flashlight and a screwdriver earlier in the film. He died.<br/><br/>Our morons then try to battle the terrifying CGI bugs attracted to their light show by setting fire to their store with mops and buckets of petrol, but fortunately none of them appear to have cigarette lighters, or know how to operate one and they only succeed in setting fire to one of their own number. Who dies.<br/><br/>So seeking for further tension a lady moron has to leave the store to be eaten by CGI monsters because she has left her children at home. All the other store morons unchivalrously refuse to accompany her to be eaten. But then after she's left, a group of the darker-skinned store morons who just finished refusing to leave with her now insist that they have to leave the store because it's all just a white-skinned conspiracy. The remaining white morons try to awaken them to the clumsy transparency of this plot manipulation but they leave anyway. And die.<br/><br/>Then some of the whiter morons who previously refused to leave, and then tried desperately to convince the others to stay decide they also must now leave to visit another store where they spend some time screaming and gibbering at CGI spider-bugs and getting killed before remembering that they have the power of movement and can return to the first store. The trip is not a complete waste however, since they return with a comic book which was unavailable in their own store.<br/><br/>Unfortunately in the minutes they were gone, the morons left behind in the first store have formed a religious movement and are now determined to force outside some of those who went to the other store as human sacrifices to placate the CGI gods, including a hapless young soldier whom they repeatedly stab. Until he dies.<br/><br/>This is particularly tragic as he was friends with two other hapless young soldiers who were found to have hung themselves in the safety of the loading bay after realising they were in a cretinous B-movie. They were dead.<br/><br/>As a result of all this, the morons who first refused to leave, then fought to prevent anyone else leaving, then left, then returned, then didn't want to be forced outside now decide it would be best if they left after all. Again.<br/><br/>So they leave and wander around the parking lot for a while shouting loudly to each other and waving their flashlights to attract the giant CGI bugs. Then they all die.<br/><br/>Awesome!"

"jadeitejewel","9","4","9","13 February 2009"," A movie that crept up on me and socked me in the stomach - warning, spoilers
","What a surprising, powerful movie. We rented this thinking it would be a lighthearted beastie feastie movie - I read the novella YEARS ago and had a basic idea of the plot. The monsters are good substantial B-movie monsters, the situations are good substantial B-movie situations, but the acting in this film just lifts everything to another level. I really, really enjoyed every performance and I don't think I've ever seen such great work in a movie of the caliber I thought this was. Despite obviously exploring group dynamics and human relationships in the face of extraordinary situations, there was nothing I didn't expect to see in the first however-many minutes. Then the last maybe ten minutes of the film snuck up on me and knocked me off my feet. There's a marvellous, visually stunning shot of one of the creatures (and what a creature! Hats off to the creature designer! Wow!) and the atmosphere for those twenty seconds or so is incredible, and then that ending! Call me dopey but I really, really didn't see that coming, and it was made so tremendously powerful by the performances, especially of little Nathan Gamble and Thomas Jane. Billy said whoa and so do I. What I would have given maybe 7 stars, suddenly became a 9-star movie in the final ten minutes. I thought I was in for a fun and silly movie evening and got a visceral, emotional sock in the solar plexus instead. Everyone involved in making this should be really proud of themselves."
"Caps Fan","7","4","9","4 February 2009"," Generally mediocre, but what an ending!
","Another review arising from a spontaneous DVD purchase of a film based on a Stephen King story.<br/><br/>Some have compared this to John Carpenter's 1980 effort ""The Fog"", which I liked, though many didn't. The broad outlines are similar  a small American waterfront town is engulfed by a mysterious mist/fog and a group of figures, some heroic, battles for survival against the hideous monsters the mist/fog conceals.<br/><br/>Carpenter's film is wholly supernatural, but this story has a  sort of  scientific explanation, which, it must be said, only partly works. A selection of stock characters whose types we know from other King stories  religious nut, skeptic who won't believe anything even when his nose is rubbed in it, various rednecks and lowlifes, manly hero  are added to the brew.<br/><br/>The monsters work best when we don't see them clearly  when they are spectral figures looming through the eponymous mist. Seen close up, they just look silly. The performances are no better than satisfactory, with the exceptions of Marcia Gay Harden, whose religious loony is enjoyably nauseating, the always reliable Frances Sternhagen in a small role, and Toby Jones as the apparently timid supermarket employee who shows a surprising strength when the chips are down. Script and music are adequate.<br/><br/>With all this and a rather routine roll of gory killings, this might have ranked as just another mediocre film version of a Stephen King work. But then come the closing ten minutes. The conclusion simply left me gaping at the screen. It is savage and the dreadful irony of what has happened is possibly the most frightening thing about the whole film.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10, of which at least 2 come from the ending alone."

","Most of Stephan King's movies have been victim of bad criticism. Bad adaptation of the book, another King's cookie cutter movie, not scary, predictable...... The Mist was quite a surprise for me. The movie created the illusion of I was also trapped in the super market with them. It made me think and wonder what those people going through this mysterious traumatizing circumstances, and what I would and should do. One of the reason this movie turned out be better Stephen King movie is it was about us. It was not much about the mist nor the monster in it. It was about monster in us (human nature, mind, behavior, instinct, invulnerability, insecurity that turns us into the monster to herm and kill in order to survive in extremely traumatizing survival circumstances for best or worst) I think because of strong acting from each casts (especially from Marcia Gay Harden and Thomas Jane) brought up this movie to next level like something equivalent to Lord of Files has accomplished."
"bob the moo","Null","4","9","13 July 2008"," Effective and gripping modern horror (SPOILERS)
","A severe storm in the Maine area leaves a small town all getting supplies and equipment to repair their homes in case of another brace. The busy department store is thrown into confusion whenever a local man runs into it shouting about ""something"" in the mist that has been sitting on the lake and mountains since the storm. Suddenly the town (and the store) is engulfed in the mist and screams can be heard from those caught in it. Nobody knows for sure what is happening although strange noises can still be heard from outside. An attack on the store by a hideous creatures leaves them in no doubt that they are in peril, even if the reasons are less clear  God's wrath, mass hallucination or what. As the noises increase, the tensions rise within the crowded store with factions forming and threatening to ignite the situation.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that makes me approach a film with caution then ""Stephen King's"" being before the title is one. Fortunately the reviews were positive enough to make me go along to check this out and, with some reservations, I'm glad I did. With almost no build up to speak of, the viewers find themselves trapped in the same department store as the characters with only the fact that we know this is a genre film to give us a bit more insight into what is out there in the mist. From this point what we get is an extended and professional film version of an Outer Limits episode where the monsters hidden inside the mist are of as much interest as the monsters hidden within the humans in the store. Darabont recognises that they are both of equal importance with his script and direction and some of the more scary moments are to do with the actions inside the store rather than those outside. This allows the tension to be raised on all fronts and it makes for an urgent and engaging horror film that skips across the two hour running time as if it was nothing.<br/><br/>On paper the cast suggest this is a lesser film but this is not true so much as it being a lower budget affair. Jane is an effective lead and sells a lot of it  surprising to me since I've never been that impressed by him. Braugher was a bit of a disappointment to be in regards how little he does and how soon he leaves the film. Harden dominates the film with an really good performance that drives the film's subtext of criticism of religious extremism. She prevents it being hammy or aver-acted by the total realism she brings to it, you never take her less than seriously. Outside of these two it is very much an ensemble piece and pretty much everyone does just what they have to do in a cast that includes plenty of solid names such as Sadler, Holden, Owen, Jensen and others. As director Darabont does really well to keep things tense. The trivia section tells me he used the camera crew from The Shield and you can see the effect; technically I'm sure they are used to tighter schedules but the are also very good at making the camera a device to add the sense of urgency rather than just capturing images. Technically the weakness is in the effects, which is to do with the budget. However what helps this is that we never really get a good look at anything in particular and, when we do, there tends to be a lot of action to prevent us worrying about it.<br/><br/>The film ends on a bleak note that prevents any sort of upbeat feeling. Personally I would have liked it to have ended without the final ""reveal"" because I didn't think this offered as much as a bleaker, more open ending would have done (eg just Drayton walking out into the mist). This would have left us his anguish but also offered no wider hope for the world  as it is, his situation is diminished slightly in importance by the ""twist"" being about the bigger picture. It does still work though and it leaves The Mist as an effective, bleak, interesting and scary horror movie. Goodness only knows why it did so little business in the US because, aside from some content that comes with the genre territory, this is a really effective and gripping film where the tension and horror comes from outside and inside with both given equal importance."
"douglaswilliamsmith-1","10","4","9","6 July 2008"," WOW what a surprise!!!
","I'm not above taking in the cinematic equivalent of big mac and fries now and again, and this is what I was expecting from 'The Mist' - a gloriously cheesy, morbid blood-fest to delight both with gore as well as ridiculousness.<br/><br/>Wow: I had to sit in the cinema 5 minutes after the credits rolled in sheer shock.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - a few of King's works have been made into cinema's best films ('The Shining' and 'Shawshanks' come to mind), but of course any c i n e a s t* knows the majority of movies 'based on Stephen King' can be savoured only by those few who have a soft spot for the awful tradition of Ed Wood.<br/><br/>However, King's great films have been based on his great works - and any student of King will tell you 'The Mist' was rent-payer: probably one of those works that Mr. King would cheerfully tell you he ground out in a hurry to pay the collector before they came to throw him, Tabitha and his newborn out on the street sometime in the 70's. It's a short story (now called a 'Novella' because King's so famous - believe me, when it was published it was a 'short story') with the plot that a bunch of people are trapped in a super-market being attacked by a bunch of creepy monsters.<br/><br/>Seriously - that's the plot.<br/><br/>So I cheerfully tripped into the cinema after a day on the beach ready for a laugh only to be drawn into one of the most compelling, profound and disturbing films I've seen since 'Monster' (sorry, no pun intended, the last great film was called 'Monster' I can't help it). I'm still trying to figure out whether this film is really a '10' or just a '9' that seems like a 10 simply due to the thrill of being so surprised (but hey, 9's pretty good if you're just paying the rent, right?).<br/><br/>OF COURSE you're saying 'doh, you call yourself a c i n e a s t* and you didn't know you were about to see a Durabont?' to which I can only say 'doh, how could I have know Durabon would try to make something out Mist? <br/><br/>The film takes you down the darkest of roads, where you think you know who's side you're on, but finally shows you that courage and hope are never goals you've achieved, but need constantly to attain again and again. The claustrophobic, paranoia-ridden setting of all the real action seamlessly shifts during the course of the film from a mundane location to a microcosm of American itself as it is perceived today - under siege - with the characters personifying the responses, escapes and denial mechanism Americans of all classes are turning to to deal with the situation they perceive they are in.<br/><br/>Amazingly, the film corresponds almost exactly to my own (and I venture to say any King fan's) visualisation of the story - where the worst monsters are not the creatures besieging the people but the people themselves. The story is closely followed, that is, up until the very end, when the full force of the film's moral message strikes, and you realise the the supposed heroes of the film have also taken their own monstrousness with them - the seminal point being when a gun is retrieved in a cliff-hanger moment. Durabont has made this simple, collateral occurrence in King's work to the doom of the ostensible heroes in the horrendously deviant ending he has given to the film. Thinking of current affairs during the film, it occurred to me then that - just as Barack Obama says Americans are turning to 'God and Guns' in their despair - there are more than one way to fail the challenge of being human.<br/><br/>It is then that you find the true heroine of the film left early on, only to return, mutely and momentarily, to bring us to the sudden realisation that courage consists of facing any monsters there are for those which you love, and of not losing hope.<br/><br/>Having said that, I should warn real gore fans that the monsters are crap - none of King's morbid fantasy has been kept (well, perhaps the tentacles at the beginning and the big thing at the end). It's like Durabont purposely wanted them to correspond more to the common man's nightmares than Kings unsettlingly unique visions in order not to dilute the film's moral force... I really missed the 'crazy racing stripes' on the spiders...<br/><br/>*IMDb's spell-checker doesn't recognise the term 'c i n e a s t'... how droll..."
"clemtine","6","4","9","25 June 2008"," One of the most disturbing endings ever.
","A chilling tale that starts out as a psychological horror thriller and ends on a philosophical tone. Frank Darabont adapts another Stephen King story and further proves his skill in translating the great master's visions to the screen. The premise may seem cliché to some but don't worry, this isn't one of those hacks that just make you go on counting how many people are still left. This film raises some questions that will make you think and it is often too realistic on a very political note. It is similar to Cloverfield in the way that nobody is really aware of what's happening. It's like you are also one with the people and trapped in the thick white fog. It is successful in delivering very unsettling scenes and sometimes it's not even because of the creatures in the mist. This probably has one of the most disturbing endings in film ever. Be warned, if you are touchy about religion issues, you may want to skip this. Overall, highly recommended.

","OK, I would like to first say that I LOVE Stephen Kings books (not so much the new ones) but classic Stephen King. His past books are fantastic!!! I especially loved this short story when I read it and was thrilled to see they were making a film out of it. *sigh* The disappointment was so great!! Basically the movie does follow most of the book very closely. I enjoyed that. Usually when I watch a movie that is based on a novel I am watching it to see the book come to life, not to watch something completely different. As I recall, in the book, they escape the grocery store and continue on through the mist. They never come out of it but they survive until the end. That is the best type of ending. It gives you a chance to imagine a happy ending for them or a horrible one. It give the reader a chance to continue the story. Now the ending of this movie was ridiculously stupid. The whole thing behind the movie was about human nature, how we would place blame on others for our misfortunes. The same is with the movie. In both there are those that rise above our apparent primitive nature and protect the ones they love and escape or die trying. Like I said, in the novel this happens and we can imagine the happy ending. In the movie, not so much. So they go through all the trouble, they get away from the majority of the bloodthirsty people in the supermarket, for what? So they can drive a little ways, run out of gas, and he has to kill everyone in the car? That's stupid! Oh, and conveniently the mist clears up seconds after he does this. What kind of moral is this? You help the ones you love and care about and die and the evil people prevail and are rescued? Whatever. I'm sorry people, but only the twisted would enjoy this ""new"" ending to the story. I'd be curious as to what King actually thought of it."

","Small spoiler<br/><br/>In the goofs section it says that it is a continuity issue as to what direction the Army vehicles are coming from--I disagree.<br/><br/>I felt that it was established that the Army base everyone was whispering about in the beginning was on the opposite side of the town. If this were the case it would make sense that the Army vehicles would go through the town and clean that up, working their way out to where Drayton ended up. Also, on the rescue vehicle, if you're paying attention, the woman who leaves the store to get to her children is on the refugee truck, I think this strongly hints that they went through the town first.<br/><br/>All in all I thought it was a great film...I can't say whether it was a good adaptation or not since it's easily been 12 yrs since I read the book, but I think the fact that as the movie progressed more and more people got up to leave because it was so terrifying (not the monsters mind you, but the PEOPLE) is a great vote of confidence for this film."

","I was completely surprised by how good this film was. Not only did the trailer they've been pushing for months seem corny, I was hesitant to watch more CGI monsters and crazy fundamentalist Christians...<br/><br/>What I found instead was a tightly crafted nightmare about the human condition and society, rather than the (cheesy) CGI beasts. Not only that, but the reason for the ""mist"" that arrives is a daring attempt at Lovecraftian themes which mainstream films NEVER deal with seriously.<br/><br/>I suppose it can be argued that because I went in with low expectations, I am more likely to give the film a higher rating than it ""deserves."" But after careful consideration I firmly believe this film worked hard for its ""7 star"" rating, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a crafty thriller with more under the surface than the standard Hollywood fare.<br/><br/>Heck, any film that can take a boring Steven King story and make it 2+ hours of thrills is aces in my book!"

","If I could summarize this movie into two singular words it would be; ouch, and wow. I would first like to start off about talking about the ""ouch."" When I came out of the theater It felt like I just got punched in the stomach. Not a lot of movies can do that to me, but this one left me utterly stunned, and not it a bad way. The reason I felt so, was the ending. There has been a lot of flack for the ending, people complaining ""oh it wasn't like the original, what a travesty"" bull crap, but for me that couldn't be further from the truth. I think people are forgetting some other movies that had the same problems but are now considered classics. One is A Clockwork orange. A lot of people were upset that the movie didn't end the same way as the book but look at the attention it gets now. Just for people that go watch movies that were adapted from books and expect it to unfold just as they read it remember, its called adaptation for a reason, its the directors and screenwriters ideas that are formulated from the book. Meaning its not going to be exactly like the book. But i digress. The second emotion I felt after the movie was wow, wow because I cant believe how great a movie could get such bad reviews. To me(and I know people will scoff) but this was the movie of the year(at least of the ones I've seen). I saw a little movie last week, you might of heard of it, it was called No country for old men. Now that movie had awesome, terrific reviews. The only thing I felt when I came out of the theater was I want my 10 bucks back and are all the people who loved this movie blind. The only thing great about that movie was the cinematography. Dialog:complete crap it was just pulled from the book, pacing:I was more entertained with Pulp Fiction at that had some slow pacing, Characters: the only thing I kept thinking was, ""I could care less what happens to them"". I know that all reviews are not fair that critics are influenced by other critics and the studio or personal agendas, but if your going to be a critic call it for what it is, you should be impartial. I almost missed out on my personal pick for the movie of the year because I trusted the critics. Which is why I now will never listen to them again. So personal opinion if you want to see something that can make you feel real anger, real despair and emotion not, something force fed before you even enter the movie, go see, The Mist."

Be forewarned, you will either love or hate the ending, which is different from the book, but a pleasant surprise.

","King's books and short stories transfer well to film. The Mist is a story about creturs from another dimension, and peoples reactions to the new dangerous environment. The story is similar to a socialology study, with subplot about people over reacting to extremes. I guess that is why the military is trained to react in a cold, not to panic condition. The characters, become suspicious of one another. Character start blaming one another, becoming judgmental of each person, and start to using violence etc. Well acted and directed. Each scene leave the viewer interested in the next scene. The brutal ending leaves the message about people's breaking points. A tragic ending where the protagonist becoming irrational, and makes a emotional decision. 9 out of 10. Do not miss this film."

","This reflects my opinion, so read it as such before you sit and fume! People are upset because there are not enough creature scenes. The same people were ticked off because PJ's King Kong had too many creature scenes! Darabont was not trying to make a creature feature, at least not in the conventional sense. He was rather trying to show the brutal creatures humans can be when stripped off their societal masks. Did he succeed? Yes!!! I was creeped out by the hysterical preaching of the lady, the stoic expression of the stabber, the crowd as they make a human sacrifice (Wicker Man, any one?), talk about people being disposable. No one in the movie was a pure black and white character. Excellent shades of grey. See the movie so I don't spoil it for you. You will either hate the ending or will be left with an indescribable pathos, as I can't say I loved it. It was one of the few movies that left me speechless at the end. I hated the ending of Million Dollar Baby, because yes, I do believe that life is sacred and should not be extinguished through so called mercy killing. So, in my understanding Darabont was taking a stand against mercy killing. The final kicker for me was the woman who is shown at the end atop a military vehicle who had been pleading with the shoppers to help her home is safe and sound with her children, while the 'hero' (again I love the shades of grey) responds to her plea that he has to look after his own son, and ends up killing him with his own hands. What an amazing example of how self-serving nature is not the best means in a desperate situation. I don't know what I would have done in his situation but it surely made me think of moral choices from a different perspective. I thought it was an excellent movie that had enough gore for me, but the real sense of the movie comes through the human players. One of the best movies of 2007! I am not your typical artsy fartsy critic because I enjoy movies like POTC, Shrek, etc. too"

","I was really surprised by ""The Mist"". The commitment is all there---every actor, every off-set hand gave everything they had---and the direction, pacing, writing, all of it works. It's so rare that a movie really scares you; horror films have turned into gore-fests because people have run out of ideas...they're not asking themselves what really scares them. But this movie is all about fear: it doesn't merely provoke it, it thinks about it, and reveals it as a threat perhaps more dangerous than the beasts outside the supermarket. After the movie my friends and I debated the meaning, recalled our favorite scenes and argued over the ending, which worked for me. This is a tale-around-the-campfire kind of movie that, at bottom, works because it's so much fun."

","Knock 20 minutes off this film and I'd have enjoyed it more and likely given it 7. For that reason, I'd recommend catching it on video.<br/><br/>The good. The creatures are cool. The overall premise is interesting and dreadful. The dynamic between the lead(artist) and the neighbor guy(lawyer type) starts off interestingly enough. Both are recognizable actors with decent on-screen appeal.<br/><br/>The bad. Dialog. Bad, slow, phony, pretentious, unconvincing and way too much of it. Canned Hollywood characters for the most part. Any decent relationships that develop are quickly discarded. The numerous whispered conversations do nothing to enhance the overall feeling of dread. The goofy attempt at group behavior analysis actually takes away from the scary factor. Chop out 20 minutes of this trash and you have a more watchable movie.<br/><br/>We get several minutes of a foul-mouthed, apocalyptic wack-job. She cusses, rants and raves and reads scriptures all while zombifying the poor locals and pressing them to the brink of human sacrifice. This kind of stereotypical straw-man seems a fixture of Stephen King's work, reflecting his apparent personal contempt for religious folk. Over the top in this flick, in my view, and rather distasteful.<br/><br/>Oh and the ending was uh...different.

","I wrote the Summary before I checked to see when the story was published. I never read the novella; however, the story overall is King-like from my other experiences.<br/><br/>Unfortunately (at least for me), this plot was neither suspenseful nor horrifying. The characters were cardboard, stilted, and annoying at best/worst (which added to the pre-1980 appeal). Actually, the logical inconsistencies throughout the movie made the ending somewhat unsurprising, even predictable, since they obviously had to deliver a ""shocker"" to rescue the rest of it - which I think is largely why they ended it the way they did. Having said that, it was the only thing I found truly King-like, and was the main redeeming part of the film - even though ironically, that was not Mr. King's original ending! It worked though - since the ending boosted my score, also, bringing my rating up to ""2."" (Addendum: See vote upgrade comment to follow)<br/><br/>Another reviewer labeled this 'Horrendous,' and I found most of those observations matched my own. Indeed, this was a movie during which I found myself checking my wristwatch to see when it might end. The first time I did this was when I saw - eghad... tentacles. Wow that is sooo scary. ...and again when I saw - oh no... big bugs. Someone save me. The movie ""Alien"" made it so that big bugs just aren't scary anymore - we're desensitized to that. Let's move on now...<br/><br/>I will agree that the bugs were secondary to the overall focus, which involved stupid people. For me, this movie did not deliver ""horror"" since it was a relief and almost cathartic to see stupid cartoon-like characters being cleansed from the gene pool, which might be what Mr. King intended all along. In that sense it was an uplifting movie after all. I'm upgrading my score to a 5 based on this recent revelation."
"mshavzin","2","3","6","29 September 2016"," an illogical mess
","Besides the less then stelar opinion of mankind presented, the movie has nothing to offer. The most egregious insult is the fact that the stupid woman that went out into the mist that killed everyone because her kids were alone made it out safe. HOW? By some magic that protects idiots who think kids are the most extra special thing ever? Garbage. And how did everyone not realize they were dealing with animals from somewhere else? It seemed pretty clear that the mist was the atmosphere they needed, so if they worked on getting rid of the mist itself, maybe they would have made it. Also, the idea that religious people crack up is old. And boring. I bet most religious people would stay logical and good natured longer then some liberal kiddie. Just waay too typical."
"Leofwine_draca","9","3","6","29 August 2016"," Modern-day monster fest is a minor classic
","I had a MIST Christmas in 2008. I read the Stephen King novella in the run-up to the holiday, got the DVD as a present, and watched it on Boxing Day. The story is superb and I was hoping the film would hold up; I'm pleased to say that it does. The box states that this is one of the best horror films ever made and, while I wouldn't go that far, it's certainly one of the best I've seen in the last decade and hands down beats the kind of moronic torture porn currently being churned out in cinemas.<br/><br/>Essentially this is a '50s B-movie with a modern day setting. The story will be familiar to any horror fan: a group of characters are holed up in a single locale and must face attacks by deadly creatures from outside. It's been popular since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and I'm sure it will be popular for decades to come. This is a splendid version of the story, blessed by some fantastic CGI creature effects – you'll truly believe that these monstrosities are living, breathing creations. The mix of character and action is spot on and the story is slightly slower paced than most modern blockbusters, letting us get to know, understand and care about the characters before exposing them to horrific situations.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent. Thomas Jane's every man hero is his best on screen acting to date, while Marcia Gay Harden is the most frightening thing in the film – and she's not even a monster! I've never liked Laurie Holden much but she does a good job here, while character actors like William Sadler and Toby Jones put in terrific turns. The end of the original story by Stephen King wouldn't have translated too well to screen, so they changed it here, opting for an absolute gut-punch that I won't spoil, suffice to say it must be one of the darkest moments in a film I've ever witnessed. Kudos to Frank Darabont for taking a relatively unknown King story and running away with it, creating a modern-day classic in the process."
"chocolateboyshivi","8","3","6","24 August 2015"," The most tragic horror movie you will ever see -
","This movie delivers a longer lasting terror than is expected from it after watching the trailers. Apart from the conventional graphical demons, the movie builds over a wonderful story with a well chosen cast. The original script is based on the novel by Stephen King, but has been modified by the director/writer Frank Darabont. A young artist David Drayton(Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) are trapped in a supermarket with a group of other terrified people, when an alien/demon attack unleashes on the city. But the movie catches attention when this fear forces these people to turn against each other. This movie also delivers a comment on human nature, human relationships and their impact on the decisions they make. Even though the basic idea of a monster attack on city is clichéd, but the movie wraps it with some very creative writing, and thrilling story telling. I would rate the movie as a 'Good Watch'."

","I got a copy of The Mist to watch at a party with my best friends, expecting some cheap horror movie rip-off of The Fog... but by the end of The Mist, we were all shocked, in a good way. This movie has a deeper side to it and to really let it sink in you have to watch it all the way through.<br/><br/>The movie starts off rather strangely, with a lightning storm that seems to not have much relevance to the plot until later. Dave Drayton goes to the supermarket with his son Billy and neighbor/friend Brent... apparently a military project has happened in the night that the public doesn't know about, says Brent. While in the supermarket, a heavy mist settles over everything and the large group of people inside are forced to barricade themselves in against some very otherworldly attackers, from giant octopus tentacles to oversized killer insects. Soon tensions run high, especially when the nutty religious fanatic lady trapped in the group starts convincing people of some bad ideas.<br/><br/>Okay, sure, some of the effects were kinda lame, like the giant octopus tentacles, but still, this movie has a good enough story to still be well-worth watching. It's the ending that really leaves an impression, more than the rest of the movie, and unlike most apocalypse movies that feature commandos shooting at zombies or superspies fighting off the end of the planet, this film features a truth in the fiction, it depicts the madness and mayhem that would ensue should the world ever really come to an end.<br/><br/>I also recommend watching Testament (1983) and Dawn of the Dead (1978) if you're looking for movies similar to The Mist."

","Even after all these years, Stephen King's material continues to be an ever-flowing source of terrific horror entertainment. Based on his novella, The Mist is one freaky, thrilling, and terrifying experience that pits a handful of people (and by extension, the audience) against a plethora of some of the scariest and most unnatural monsters imaginable. The film really hammers the fear into the audience, as characters suffer some rather frightening encounters and horrific deaths. It gets even more unnerving as characters bicker and fight amongst themselves. There are some cases where you might get wound up by the characters' infighting, but it'll be the film's ending which will prove to be the most polarizing aspect. While the novella just ended inconclusively, the film pulls out one heck of an ironic twist in the last moments; it is a cold, brutal, hard-hitting finale that you'll either love or hate (and it'll either make or break the film for you).<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple, and not much different than something like Dawn of the Dead; it just swaps out zombies with Lovecraftian monsters. What really makes it work is, first of all, the characters, who are all adequately developed and full of emotional intensity. You get a good feeling for who these people are and how intense their struggle for survival really is. In light of such adversity, the film also does an excellent job of underscoring the themes of civil order as it breaks down. The film ultimately becomes a microcosm depicting the end of the world, not overrun by hellish monsters necessarily, but overrun by a primal cult of irrational and fearful human beings. Between the scary monsters and the crazed humans, I couldn't tell you which one is scarier.<br/><br/>The film has quality photography and editing. Acting is pretty swell, and the writing matches up pretty well with the original story. This production makes the best use of its sets, props, and costumes. Some of the special effects don't hold up very well, but are imaginatively rendered. Music is pretty decent.<br/><br/>With its surprise ending, you'll either love or hate this film. I for one love it, and consider it one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)"

It appeared that director Frank Darabont decided not to update the dialog from the book, making seemingly ever line of dialog feel fake and dated. Not only did the film show the monsters too soon, but it showed too much revealing the shoestring budget the film was produced on. Seriously, half the theater laughed when the ""squid"" showed up in the first half hour. The plot was non existent, making the film seem as if it was adapted from a play ( most of the film takes place in a drab supermarket) I kept hoping things would get better but after Marcia Gay Harden's 3rd over the top ""end of days"" speech I had enough.

The story and the movie do this well, giving us only a glimpse of the true horrors out in the mist and never giving anyone a sense of what kind of world was out there.<br/><br/>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER The story and the movie move along together, with the small group of survivors setting out in a car, but the story ends with the giant thing crossing their path on the road and the characters realizing that, oh no, this is it - it is a whole new world and nothing is going to be the same again.<br/><br/>To me, that was the magic of the story. That OH NO moment right at the end.<br/><br/>But the movie completely changes it and makes the whole thing much more bleak ... and even depressing. I mean, I get the point of the ending, but one of the best things about a King story or novel is that the horrors don't always get resolved. We are left to wonder what might be. To resolve the matter in the movie, and in the very depressing way Darabont did, upset me.<br/><br/>I will say this, if I had never read the story I would give this movie a solid 7, at least (I still would think the ending is just too bleak).

It was painful to watch and I found myself envious of the people who decided to walk out of the picture.<br/><br/>There's very little explanation of the mist...

Of course not everyone likes the same movies but if you don't like - 10000 BC - I Am Legend you know what I mean, then don't watch this bad bad movie. Okay first of all the characters are very stereotypic and the actors seems to over dramatize their roles in eager of an Oscar - which unfortunately succeeded for Marcia Gay Harden. She was the one who really annoyed me during the whole movie and I don't understand how she could win such one. Second, the special effects are very poor and lousy. I don't understand how so many people find this movie great ?? In Denmark this kind of movie would have the label ""American"". Many movies are of course American but only the bad movies where it has been filled up with a little romance, a little father and son relationship, a little etic and morale, and OF COURSE a little about beliefs and religion gets this label. Disgusting."
"Buzz_act","2","4","10","29 July 2008"," One of the worst films I've seen this year
","First off I'd like to say that I'm not a huge fan of the ""The Green Mile"" and whilst I like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I personally think the film is overrated. That being said I can understand and appreciate why people would like or even love those movies.<br/><br/>I can not however, understand why people here are giving Frank Darabont's newest movie such good reviews or why its holds the rating of 7.5 which it clearly doesn't deserve. This movie is truly awful, one of the worst that I have seen this year.<br/><br/>The characters have barely any substance to them and are not endearing what so ever. The plot drags on in a mundane and pointless manner and the acting is spotty at best.<br/><br/>Whilst this movie steals moments from great films (most notably ""Aliens"") and a great music score from the ""300"", it completely fails to capture the same (or in fact any) sense of urgency, tension, awe and perhaps most importantly in a horror movie; fear.<br/><br/>This may in part be due to the characters insurmountable stupidity. I would like to say that it is reminiscent of cheesy 80s horror movies where the protagonist moves toward the blood curdling screams but unfortunately their stupidity is much worse than this.<br/><br/>As well as this there are points in the movie where the set completely changes in a matter of seconds with no real explanation as why. This added to bad characters and the shoddy acting from the cast playing them makes the whole thing unbelievable and quite frankly totally ridiculous.<br/><br/>The reason why I am giving this film 2 out of 10 instead of 1 (the lowest score you can give) is due to the ending. It is fairly original and coupled with the absurd nature of the rest of the film, is at the very least funny.<br/><br/>This is however no where near enough to save the film. Take my advice and instead of wasting two hours of your life with this terrible movie go and watch paint dry instead. You'll end up being much more fulfilled."

"jetbentmanner","1","4","10","29 March 2008"," Commentary on Steven King and his awful film ""The Mist""
","I agree with the Germans....<br/><br/>I rented ""The Mist"" thinking I'd be in for at least a semi-decent sort of horror flick by Steven King. I think I realize now that my first mistake was thinking that something written by Steven King would actually be good. What I recognized first was the God-Awful Dialogue that plagues the entire screenplay. Did everyone go to Pseudo-Colloquial English Grammar School? From demonizing Christians, to murdering innocent people, to offering human sacrifices, to making completely idiotic ""subtle"" remarks about the government, this movie has it all when it comes to repulsiveness. Also notable is Steven King's idiotic, communist ultra-liberalistic pessimism which shines through the majority of the film. I don't understand why so many people think that the ending was even remotely good. He shoots his son in the head. If anything this proves that King has no confidence in human character, and he's also leaving out man's ability to overcome extreme threats and man's will to live at all costs.<br/><br/>Every character is completely godless save for the raving lunatic woman who only quotes (out of context) the Old Testament and Revelations, completely ignores any part of the bible containing Jesus, and congregates all of the other godless grocery buying sheep into killing an innocent soldier over this so called ""Arrowhead"" Operation. At the end of the film when five characters remain (including the protagonist, his son, a beautiful woman, and an elderly man and woman) they run out of gas and decide that the only thing to do is have the protagonist kill them; just moments before the ""military"" rides on through. This has got to be the most godless, immoral, troglodytic, cynical ending to a film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>King has the tendency to forgo doing any actual research about anything he composes. I think that he must sit at home and contrive short stories and novels based off of tabloids. A few questions about the validity of what I'll call ""King's Research:"" Why is that all of this evil that is unleashed is the Army's fault? Why is it that the Army is wearing BDUs (instead of the ACUs which have been around for years)? What's the deal with this Military Policeman who wears a uniform that hasn't been used by the army in over 30 years, drives a Jeep that the Army hasn't used in more than 20 years, and knows everything about the happenings of the nearby ""Army base"" just in time to apologize to the main characters? I don't think I need to go on any further about this atrocious vomit of a film.<br/><br/>The problem that King makes through the film is his attempts at social commentary. These ""remarks"" are effectually misgui- This movie makes people look retarded.<br/><br/>My final word is: Don't waste your time watching ""The Mist."" If you do watch it, and you're an intelligent person, then you will have wasted more than an hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back. Don't see ""The Mist.""<br/><br/>Elements of other films in ""The Mist."" See if you can find them:<br/><br/>1. Event Horizon<br/><br/>2. Cujo<br/><br/>3. Aliens<br/><br/>4. Dagon<br/><br/>5. Godzilla<br/><br/>6. The Langoliers<br/><br/>7. Kraken<br/><br/>8. Every Other Steven King Film"
"blue_zipadeeduda","1","4","10","29 March 2008"," Stephen King is so rich.
","Stephen King did it again. Within 20 minutes the mystery is over and you start seeing giant tentacles and goat-spiders everywhere. And who turns out to be the real monster? Humans!!!! WOAH! We're such a bad race. The only good part is when Tom Jane shoots his whole family in the head (including his ten year old son) to spare them from the monsters, only five minutes before the army shows up to save everyone. I especially enjoyed hearing people in the theater laughing when this happened, in the bootlegged copy I watched. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this tripe. Keep it up Stephen King, when will we get to see your killer lamp blockbuster? Or the pack of gum that chews you? Will it be the army's fault again? Or a terribly obvious supernatural force? Or BOTH??? Just don't forget to include one of your contrived morals about the duality of the human spirit, and the monsters in all of us. You should have sprung for a thousand typewriting monkeys, instead of just one. ooooOOOOOOOoooooH!"
"lightsleeper23","1","4","10","25 March 2008"," Might be the worst ending in movie history...
","I won't go off on it too much because it seems that a lot of people on here agree with me and have already said most of it better. <br/><br/>I watched the special features on DVD, and seeing the conversation with Frank Darabont and Stephen King shocked me. To see that King also liked the ending didn't surprise me a whole lot, it was actually pretty King-esquire, what bothered me was hearing Frank reveal that not only did he insist on the ending being not changed in the slightest, he actually took a smaller budget and less time to film just so he could implement this horrific ending.<br/><br/>I believe what Darabont did to the ending was not only in bad taste, but an insult to movie fans. An ending like that isn't just bad, it's a slap in the face. It's like saying, ""here, THIS (SLAP!) is what you get for driving to a theatre and paying $40.00 for three movie tickets, $12.00 for a small popcorn, investing two hours of your life, getting to know lots of characters, coming to care about them, and oh yeah, supporting me and my family. (SLAP!) one more time. Have a nice day.""<br/><br/>And to those people who like the movie and think the only reason we hate it is because ""we don't want to admit a movie affected us this much...?"" To you I say this: This movie DIDN'T affect me, I didn't even watch most of it. Luckily I was warned by a caring friend about the ending and watched parts of it on his DVD. The whole movie theatre thing was hypothetical to prove a point. From what I have seen of it, the movie itself didn't look very good either. <br/><br/>Something is wrong with Stephen King lately, and I think he's lost his mind. First this, and now he actually let Eli Roth get hired to make Cell into a movie. The same Eli Roth whom he once said he didn't like because his movies were tasteless violence with no substance? Really Stephen? I just don't know about him and his projects anymore. I just don't know. I may stop being a fan."

"butterflyeleven","3","4","10","30 November 2007"," Horrific Conclusion
","I am a long-time fan of Stephen King and have read all of his books, so naturally I cannot pass up an opportunity to see one of his amazing works on film. The novella ""The Mist"" in King's ""Skeleton Crew"" is one of my favorite of his short stories. The movie was satisfyingly accurate...until the end. While many of King's novel endings are inclusive (and yes, sometimes irritatingly so) nothing could have prepared me for the literal feeling of sickness I left ""The Mist"" with. The ending was not inconclusive, it was one of the most horribly written conclusions I have ever encountered. I was shocked, to say the least, since Frank Darabont has written/directed some of the ONLY screenplays I trust to even compare to the writings of Stephen King. Both ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" were awesomely matched to their books, which is why I am so disappointed and horrified by the ending of ""The Mist."" Minus the ending, the movie was both accurate and entertaining. To be two such amazing writers, I am confused as to how Darabont and/or King thought that this was the best conclusion for the film. There's a possibility that I would have been equally impressed by a 20-minute documentary on flies in an outhouse."
"KevinAnderson1","Null","4","10","26 November 2007"," Truly Amazing, A Real Classic Horror Flick...
","I wonder, how does anyone start writing 'bout such a great flick. Where to begin? I mean, when I first saw the trailer I thought this movie was going to be another cheesy wannabe horror movie but Oh man, what was I wrong. I never thought nowadays, that I would be sitting at the cinema with a girl grabbing my hand so tight, and me myself doing the same thing to her hand. The scenes were so tense and exciting that I just wanted to leave the theater And stay there at the same time. Why did I want to leave? Well for the simple fact that during the whole movie, I thought I was one of the characters, afraid of what was coming next.<br/><br/>The actors ALL did a great job, especially Marcia Gay Harden as the Christian psycho. How many times did I want to slap her to the face. Thomas Jane really got up a notch in his acting ability. He really played his part convincing and true. Just all the actors did a fine job...<br/><br/>Now the ending, before I saw this movie, I read a few comments on this board and some people said they were disappointed by the ending. I wonder, what was wrong with it. I mean, was it wrong because the ending almost (in my case) made you cry? Like you really wanted to jump out of your body and run away like Forest? I truly believe that the ending was just PERFECT. The last minute was breathtaking.<br/><br/>You rarely see a movie where you actually feel like your one of the main characters.<br/><br/>So folks, really, believe me, when it comes to horror movies I'm rather criticizing than praising them. But The Mist is just a top notch quality movie. Don't miss it at the cinemas 'coz you'll regret it big time!<br/><br/>Rate: ****/****"
"desiplaya","Null","4","10","25 November 2007"," Another Darabont Gem
","Another Stephen King adaptation and done, once again, by Frank Darabont.<br/><br/>I read the story a week before I saw it so it was fresh in my mind. It sticks closely to the book up until the end. Darabont is awesome, as always, when it comes to adapting King's works. He builds up the tension and suspense throughout the movie at a great pace. You're not given much background into the lives of the characters and the origins of the mist, which is explained towards the end quickly.<br/><br/>All the actors do a very good job. I don't know why people are complaining about it. Out of all the actors though, Marcia Gay Harden easily steals the show with her character of the Bible thumping Mrs. Carmody. By the end of the movie, you will really HATE her and want to kill her yourself. Kudos to Harden.<br/><br/>The monster effects aren't all that great but I didn't go see the movie for the monsters. Yes they look cheesy but it's alright by me. People are complaining that they showed the monsters too early. In my opinion it's perfect where they are and it matches up with the story.<br/><br/>The ending was simply shocking. Not how the story ends but I liked the movie ending more. It's not ambiguous like the ending of the story. It's shocking and depressing yet as one reviewer said, it evokes a lot more emotion than the book ending. Don't go thinking that you'll get a happy mushy ending like most Hollywood endings. Stephen King said that he loves the movie ending and would have written that for the book if he had thought of it first and I agree with him. Some people will hate it and say it totally ruins the movie and doesn't line up with the character while others will love it. Either way it's a ending that'll stick with you long after you're done watching it.<br/><br/>I'll be looking forward to the next Darabont/King movie.<br/><br/>9/10"

","i have to respect frank darabont for giving us shawshank redemption. it was a very good film. but, it was an almighty fluke. the green mile was good, the majestic was terrible. a good film lives or dies by characterisation and performances. this is how a film draws you in and i always say if your rooting for the bad guy or you just don't care what happens then the film has failed. with the mist i didn't care!at all! from the opening exchange between husband and wife i could tell the dialogue was stunted but6 also forced, this was fairly bad acting and it only got worse. The mist was obviously aiming at some sort of social allegory, this was completely unambiguous and the abysmal acting thrust it so far down the viewers throat it was insulting. when the ranting stopped it was time for the action and this is where the film slips from bad to turd. the editing was infuriatingly slow and basic. there was also a lot of shouting when silence would have done the job i have had enough of insulting this film as it is simply not worth it. but i just have to say the ending just didn't fit the tone of the rest of the film. it tried for impact but ended being stupid.<br/><br/>one good bit was right near the end when the music kicked in and you see something very big but thats all ill say"

","The Mist - translate this title into German, and you get literally the best description of what you are about to see, if you decide to watch this movie (125 very long minutes). It was, without a question, the most terrible and oppressive horror-film I have ever happened to experience until now. I can't tell if it was the awful acting or the incredibly boring plot. Maybe it was the constant use of stereotypes (which by the way, were unsupportable pushy when it came to showing the mans natural behavior in panic-situations and group dynamics...) or the incomprehensible storyline, or the predictable ending that made ""The Mist"" without a doubt the worst and unsuccessful movie I have ever seen.

","If you are looking to torture yourself, see this flick. I don't know, I guess some people liked it, but I am not even that sensitive and thought it was just terrible. Basically they spend the entire movie trying to survive, protecting the protagonist's child, and then kill off the kid senselessly in the last 5 minutes, along with the other characters who have any value, except of course, the protagonist. I don't get it. That's not even the way the novella ends! I mean, this movie is not for people who have kids, or nieces/nephews, etc. the acting was pretty sub-par, and also, they painted Christians as cult-leading freaks. The whole movie was kind of type-casted, really, the sweet blonde teacher, the heroic Dad, the young couple in love, you get the idea. And parts of it didn't make sense at all. Like in the last 5 minutes you see the woman that leaves the store to go be with her kids, how did she survive? I thought about walking out 15 minutes before it ended, and I should have. The whole movie I was holding out for a redeeming ending and felt gypped. Ugh."

"gengar843","9","6","18","22 November 2007"," From Lovecraft to Cloverfield
","EDITED REVIEW:<br/><br/>Stephen King likes to pretend he doesn't believe in traditional religion but he obviously does. He just likes to rain on everyone's parade. Whether this is a personal cruelty or just a joke, it still comes off as crass and, frankly, forced.<br/><br/>In THE MIST, a main character, Mrs. Carmody, a fundamentalist Christian living in Maine, of all places, preaches that what comes in the titular mist is vengeance from God. Stephen King makes it clear it certainly is. In fact, King is obviously angrier with misuse of technology than with misuse of the Bible. The end of Mrs. Carmody is savage in a way that appeases people who just want her to shut up, not really people who don't believe in God. What Mrs Carmody is saying is not truly out of the real of possibility, it's the way she says it. She's vulgar, curses a lot, and it seems obvious she is bipolar. This then is King's little joke, that you'd have to be literally mentally ill to be fervent. The next level down for King is fear. If you shiver for your life, you'll follow anyone. This many be true, but this is more a commentary on charismatic leaders than on religion. That Mrs. Carmody's message is at the right place and time to sway the shaken crowd isn't an indictment that she's looking for someone to lead, but rather that for the first time in her life her own faith seems to be showing itself. I don't see how anyone can fault Mrs. Carmody for that, but, like I said, she acts more like a demon than an angel, so it's not a great surprise that she gets hers.<br/><br/>As for the character David Drayton, played by the great Thomas Jane, he is the antithesis of Mrs. Carmody. He begins with a sense of fairness, as when he helps his neighbor, Brent Norton, after the thunderstorm, and watches it dashed to pieces, as when Norton accuses Drayton of trying to make him look foolish rather than trying to save his life. Of course, the deepest fall for Drayton is at the end, when he commits the ultimate acts of faithlessness one minute too soon. We can talk about whether it was murder or assisted suicide, mercy or thoughtlessness, but there is no doubt that whatever faith in himself Drayton had disappears in that moment, and he now realizes he should've had faith in the Almighty to rescue him, even if not in Mrs. Carmody, who obviously was not going to save anyone. <br/><br/>This brings up an interesting question: Did the people in the supermarket ultimately survive? If they did, was it not by the crazed and herself-murderous Mrs. Carmody that they did. Alas, we don't know. What we DO know is that the character played by Walking Dead alumnus Melissa McBride DID survive, and seemingly was rewarded for her own courage, if not faith. Speaking of Walking Dead, THE MIST is written/directed/produced by Frank Darabont, co-creator of that winning series, Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath on WD), and Laurie Holden (Andrea on WD), a veritable what-what!?.<br/><br/>The beasts from THE MIST are Lovecraftian, and the premise is slight, that the military has released them into our dimension from another, through an unknown scientific process. THE MIST predates CLOVERFIELD by one year, but these monsters and their sounds seem awfully familiar. Is it possible the films take place in the same timeline universe? Watching them back-to-back, there is a feeling that CLOVERFIELD is a continuation, as perhaps beasts which escaped destruction in Maine, although CLOVERFIELD seems to indicate those might've come from another planet.<br/><br/>The pace of this film is well-suited and there is little filler. The characters are briefly-delineated but sufficiently so. There is a feeling of anxiety but not rushed. The effects are well-done and the atmosphere is pretty great.<br/><br/>9/10"

Since this is an adaptation of a book (by Stephen King), I can't fire on the story but only watch this if you can handle gruesome deaths and a seriously messed up ending. The ending was what ruined the movie for me, I'll try not to give any big spoilers but what happened was character A kills 4 people (one of whom is his family) to free them from the pain of living in a world infested with monsters, BUT ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE WORLD IS RESTORED BACK TO NORMAL 5 MINS LATER!

Little side note, I watched this movie for the first time in 2014.<br/><br/>There is just nothing good about this movie. All the characters are just plain unreasonable stupid. Their decision don't make any sense at all and they get in to fights for, honestly, no reason. Even if the mist is playing with their minds, it's still unreasonable. Adding to this stupidity and lack of character development, this movie is not scary at all. It's kind of like another splatter movie. I get that it is somehow mysterious to not see the evil that is lurking in the mist, but once these atomic insects show up, everything but satisfaction or horror is setting in. And the worst thing is the ending, or maybe even the best part. I get how dramatic that scene is supposed to be, but it's just so hilarious that just 5 seconds, after he gets out of the car, the army shows up. This scene is just utter bullshit.<br/><br/>Anyways, there is so much more I could say about this movie, but I'm still kind of surprised that this gets so much praise in the comments.

","My title can be said for the characters in this movie, as well as the audience. As the summary says, it's a movie about survival. This movie had its jumps, scares, and it wasn't predictable. Better sound (both music and effects) could have added more suspense. The actors are all familiar faces.<br/><br/>I disliked three major things, the first being what I like to call a karma-plot, where they portray characters based on their upcoming fate. That's the best I can describe it without using examples that may insinuate on specifics of the movie. The second thing I disliked was laughing at the screen with simple suggestions. ""Why don't you just...?"" over and over again. The third thing was the self-shot drag-outs like in the movie Thin Red Line. The movie is based on the short story by Stephen King, and the short part is what gets dragged out.

It's essentially a study of social behaviour and how people communicate under extreme circumstances.

This pseudo religious theme hanging over it is ridiculous. The IMDb rating is insanely high. If you honestly like this movie.. well then thats your good right I guess, but I was about to say something different.<br/><br/>Here an excerpt:<br/><br/>Started out normal, first introduction of characters was a bit dull, noticeable was somewhat poor acting.<br/><br/>dialog between neighbors was poorly written, including in the car. But lets see how this turns out.<br/><br/>Then the scene in the supermarket. I don't know what people think of this, but it was horrible. Long, boring, ridiculous dialogs, and insane scripting. Some actors are able to act, but the dialog made them look horrible. scripting-wise; I don't understand who wrote this.<br/><br/>Funny moment was when protagonist went to the generator to shut it of and then hurt his hand or something and then fell and was just overall extremely clumsy. and does this scene lead to anything? no, totally unnecessary. why was he back there anyway? to get blankets? really he had no reason for being there.<br/><br/>Then they want to open the door to the mist they were all scared about not an hour ago. just to get the generator running (why, its daylight).

Lets get out of here and face certain death! oh yeah thats because they assume the crazy lady is gonna need sacrifices.<br/><br/>Well what do you know, the crazy lady conspiracy turned out to be true. crazy rednecks all turn psycho within a day. Good to see the true heart of America at his best.<br/><br/>Lets cut in a long car scene with no dialog (thank god) and choose the worst misplaced song ever to carry it.<br/><br/>""Lets just see how far the tank takes us"".

You can even scout a bit first.<br/><br/>Oke out of gas, were not out of the mist yet. Lets go through our options. Nah lets kill ourselves right now. OK lets do it. Bang bang bang bang.<br/><br/>(at this moment I was thinking to myself: for the love of god don't let the mist dissolve now. its a crap ending but at least its an ending)<br/><br/>and of course within seconds the mist is gone and the army arrives. sigh sigh mega sigh!<br/><br/>the end.

I hate children suffering and it lulled me into a false sense of security as i've been told that Steven King rarely lets kids suffer! How wrong I was! If you not sensitive about kids then this is a great film, If you can get over the bad effects. I just feel that nowadays instead of a good scare, they now have to try shock people to get a reaction.

"zaisjr","4","3","7","24 February 2010"," Not as good of representation of human nature as some say.
","I'm not sure if it's because of Stephen King's name being affiliated with this movie, but the movie does get a little bit of hype. This movie is supposed to be about human nature. It's trying to show how humans would typically react to such a strange and awful event. For a movie that is trying to show human nature, it failed on many fronts. This movie is basically supposed to be ""War of the Worlds"" meets ""Lord of the Flies"". But Lord of the Flies was much better at showing human nature. Matter of fact, the children in Lord of the Flies showed more intelligence than the people in the Mist. I have been in survival situations before and can tell you that this movie doesn't do a good job of portraying humanity. It does have some truth to it, but plenty of fallacy. Here are my points for why this movie fails. 1. Mrs. Carmody. Yes, in crazy situations religious zealots will start preaching. But here's the thing. All of these people are scared and start becoming religious. Yet, do you see any of them praying? Nope. Not one. Just preaching. When religious people are scared, they start praying. Also, only a select few idiots would fall for her preachings about the end of the world. Most people in America know that she was missing 99% of the prophecies of the apocalypse. Even with a Bible present, nobody called her out on her errors. 2. The doubters (those who doubted there were monsters in the mist) claimed that a mine accident probably caused the deaths of people in the parking lot. Soooooooo everyone who goes outside afterward makes NO attempt at covering their mouths nor faces. Not one attempt. In the beginning a man dies within a few yards of the store. Instead of claim it was a monster, they say it was gasses. So they go outside without protection. Right. 3. Right from the beginning people wondered if this had something to do with the military. Trapped in the store are three military men. Nobody thinks about questioning these men until it's too late. Matter of fact, the military men don't even follow their training. Any soldier will tell you that these characters were wasted in the movie. They didn't use their training nor were they used as a resource. 4. Okay, so you think there are monsters in the mist killing people. Actually, now you KNOW they are killing people. So what do you do? You go outside, stand straight up, and walk incredibly slow to your next location. For crying out loud, even the soldier did this. Why? You are on the defense. Why the heck are you making yourself into a large slow-moving target? 5. The ending. I won't go into specifics. But the protagonists of the movie will do anything to survive. They are willing to take risks to survive. They will even kill other people in their way in order for them to escape. The ending was quite out of character for all of the protagonists. I understand the irony and purpose of the ending. But I would have expected that sort of ending to have happened to the people in the grocery store who stayed behind. Nope. Instead the protagonists broke character. The ending will make you very very angry. I promise. <br/><br/>I compare this movie, after seeing what it was really worth, to ""30 days of Night"". Great premise. Great suspense. Poor characters. Poor ending. Thanks for reading."

","The good: Excellent acting, great direction, superior character development and dialog.<br/><br/>The bad: Horribly bleak ending, and I mean bleak beyond words.

Essentially, the evil inside (the fruitcake Fundamentalist) was just as dangerous as the evil outside. Although the movie established the 'evil inside' as a fruitcake early on, she's obviously merely a vehicle to convey the film maker's prejudice against Christianity. No significant alternative religious perspective was portrayed: just one hyper-fundamentalist inciting the weak-minded and fatalistic towards frenzy and slaughter.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a terribly wasted effort.

","I'm so sick of horror movies that kill characters based on their perceived ""moral"" standing. Extremely good or extremely evil, either way you're a goner! Throughout this type of film there is a sensed god that is making these decisions based on some imperceptible right-or-wrong doing of the doomed characters. What did they do to deserve their horrific ends? The biggest teller is always when 2 relatively young people make out. It's a sure sign that the girl is gonna get hers in the next scene! And the ending! Yowsa! We are somehow supposed to feel horror at the fact that this poor loser just killed his own son and 3 other friends to keep them from dying at the tentacles of some alien creature (and frankly not that much worse of a death), come to find out he didn't have to? If this truly had happened, how long do you suppose the idiot would have spent yelling at the side of his car before he grabbed one of the soldier's weapons and offed himself? Maybe another 3 seconds? Shouldn't that have been the real end of the movie?

If you're surrounded by evil, do absolutely nothing and you should be OK. Morally bankrupt!"
"infortunatus","3","3","7","5 October 2009"," Just rent something else.
","What can I say? I don't get scared by CG. In fact, films relying on CG generally don't entertain me. I like things you can touch. Having said that, this film would have been even more laughable if it been made with rubber beasties. This film had potential, but it felt like a TV movie with a TV script at times. The CG Monsters that we couldn't quite see were not interesting. I fully understand that we're supposed to see what the characters see, and feel a kind of ""What on earth is that thing that I can't quite see properly?"" feeling. But the only feeling I got was boredom.<br/><br/>Despite this, as so many of you have written before me, it does try to explore human nature in a ""no-win"" situation. Who are the heroes and who are the fools, how we deal with impending death and stuff. True, the ending was interesting, and kinda thought provoking. But calling it a horror is stretching it a little. I mean, it felt like a 50s monster flick like ""Tarantula"" or something, with over-sized lizards or Plasticine monsters. These films just play on our simplest of phobias, for example spiders and bugs, and then they fill in the gaps with ""cheap shocks"" that are just meant to make you jump out of your seat.<br/><br/>Before I finish moaning let's just think about ""The Thing"" from 1982. Most of you who wrote reviews before me probably failed to notice that at the start of ""The Mist"" we see the film poster for ""The Thing"" on the wall of the main character's workroom. Now then, ""The Thing"" had a tag line, it was ""The Ultimate in Alien Terror,"" and at that time it was pretty close to the mark. If they were paying homage or trying to draw a comparison between these two films, I'm afraid the ""The Mist"" just pales into insignificance. The music, the atmosphere, the horror, the suspense, the creatures, the thrills, and the ending of ""The Thing"" were far superior in every way.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I doubt it'll be remade in 30 years time like ""The Fog"" from 1980. Actually, now that I'm really thinking about it, just go rent ""The Fog"" instead, it's far scarier."

","I can say with all honesty that I didn't enjoy this film. A fairly B-grade horror film with creatures from another dimension, the usual annoying villains that populate some of Stephen King's books, in this case a religious zealot.<br/><br/>Trouble is I couldn't get the ending out my mind. The nightmare vision of the giant creature towering above the van. Then the awful decision by Drayton and his scream of anguish at the end.<br/><br/>I didn't like the ending. It was depressing. How can you enjoy something like that? However, it was a sting in the tail of the movie, and ultimately that is a sign of effective horror isn't it? Effective horror is meant to shock, effective horror is meant to have the viewer care about the characters involved in the action, and what happens to them. The Mist achieved that.<br/><br/>Another of King's short stories adapted into film ""The raft"" had a similar effect on me. I hated it, but I didn't forget the end in a hurry. Same as Pet Semetary. A whole novel spent developing interesting characters that all die horrible deaths, and undeaths. <br/><br/>It is certainly different to the sentimental endings in movies such as I am Legend, which destroyed an interesting book by Richard Matheson.<br/><br/>Maybe films like the mist are effective examples of the horror genre, which more and more I find is not my cup of tea."

"varundelpiero","9","3","7","26 January 2009"," Everything a Horror Movie should beand more
","Frank Darabont's THE MIST is perhaps the third best adaptation of a Stephen King novel/novella after THE GREEN MILE and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, and is quite likely the best adaptation of a predominantly horror-infused work from the 'Master of Horror'.<br/><br/>From the intro, THE MIST grabs the viewer, and doesn't let go until the climactic ending sequence. Even the quiet, 'safe' moments are filled with a palpable and real tension that few of these modern horrors fail to provide.<br/><br/>The acting is quite solid, as even the 'small-part' characters seem realistic and well-drawn. Thomas Jane does a more than adequate job of playing the strong and rational protagonist. Opposite him, Marcia Gay Harden is extremely effective as the Bible-quoting, holier-than-thou prophetess, foretelling the impending Apocalypse and unstoppable Doom. It is her character that invokes the biggest emotional response from audiencesafter the creatures, of course.<br/><br/>THE MIST is not just a good horror movie; it is a fascinating study of fear, paranoia, hopelessness, religious fanaticism, and the human response. This is a compelling and thought-provoking film that will surprise many viewers. A special note must be made about the ending: while many viewers complain that it was in poor taste, or unnecessary, I wholeheartedly disagree. The atmosphere, music, and the very events of the ending propelled this film from good to great. It is also worth noting that Darabont deviated from King's ending, which turned out to be a welcome surprise from someone who sticks rather strongly to the source.<br/><br/>The only thing preventing me from giving this film a perfect 4-star rating is the half-hearted 'explanation' of the events. Darabont, whose strength lies in creating atmosphere and mystery, would have done well to leave this up to the viewer to decide on and speculate upon. Nonetheless, a 3.5 star rating is a deserved one. The film also warrants a 9/10, and should appear in my Top 150 at 138. Highly recommended."

"orangutancousin","3","3","7","3 December 2008"," I'm definitely not a fan.
","I understand that The Mist was a powerful horror experience for many - I've heard more than one person calling it one of the best horror movies in years - so when I saw it, I admit I was disappointed. I'm not going to be an a*s and throw around words like 'overrated', because I'm sure supporters of The Mist do have their reasons for loving it, but I nearly hated the whole thing.<br/><br/>The Mist started off promisingly enough. The first 20 minutes set up the atmosphere and characters very well. However, the movie suddenly turns horrifically cheesy during the first creature attack. I was laughing when I'm positive that I should've been scared. This continued throughout the rest of the movie - The Mist takes itself very seriously, but for the most part, I found the whole thing fairly laughable.<br/><br/>The performances in The Mist aren't anything to rave about, either. I've heard almost unanimous praise for Marcia Gay Harden's character, but I thought her performance was awful - way too over-the-top campy for a movie that's supposed to be serious, scary, and thoughtful. Also, I hated the religious commentary that came along with Marcia Gay Harden's character. I'm all for intelligent commentary on the growing number of close-minded, bitter, generally un-Christ-like Christians out there, but the commentary found in The Mist isn't mildly thought-provoking or interesting, just irritating and untruthful and pretentious.<br/><br/>*MAJOR SPOILERS! DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE YET!* Oddly enough, the most controversial, much-loathed aspect of The Mist (the murder/suicide scene in the car), was actually what I thought was the best part of the entire thing. It was the only legitimately shocking, horrifying, and haunting part of the film - but the VERY last scene where the military comes was awful. Thomas Janes's acting was terribly awkward, the music was way over-the-top, and I found it infuriatingly contrived and simply a cheap way to get a reaction from the audience."

","""I have nothing against religion...but religion cross-pollinates with politics. In both cases there's always somebody standing by to say, ""we have the answer."" - Stephen King <br/><br/>We've seen this type of film before, but it does several interesting things which I found refreshing. Firstly, it's a direct assault on all those Christian fundamentalists who salivate over Darabont's earlier film, ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Secondly, it's a pretty interesting study of mob dynamics. Thirdly, it works as a nice counterpoint to Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"".<br/><br/>Following 9/11, we had a slew of films which tried to be ""socially relevant"" by dealing with themes of ""terrorism"" and ""fear"". America was under attack by some faceless enemy and so Hollywood directors responded by smuggling little socio-political themes into what would otherwise be brainless popcorn flicks.<br/><br/>Spielberg's last few films offer perhaps the simplest way to observe this trend. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a loud and thoughtless film which served only to regenerate ugly pro-nationalist ideology. America is good. The enemy is bad. Die for the motherland.<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" was Spielberg's justification of the Patriot Act. You may wiretap our phones and spy on our lives, so long as you're righteous and moral. Then with ""War of the Worlds"" Spielberg painted America as being the victims of technologically advanced ""sleeper cell terrorists"", the aliens embedded within our own home soils, ready and waiting to strike. Finally there was ""Munich"", Spielberg's big ""let's forget about the past and all get along"".<br/><br/>In Hollywood, Spielberg (because of his phenomenal shooting speed) is usually 2 years ahead of the curve. So when he hit us with ""War of the Worlds"" in 2005, it took a further 2 years for other artists to create terror allegories of their own. ""No Country for Old Men"", ""In the Valley of Elah"", ""Cloverfield"", ""The Mist"", ""Dark Knight"", ""Lions for Lambs"", ""Michael Clayton"" etc etc. All these films tried to be serious by injecting faint 9/11 subtext. Most will age badly because they're so short sighted.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is basically an R rated ""War of the Worlds"". Both films begin with a mysterious and violent lightning storm, involve strange creatures attacking a family unit, and end with a ""shocking"" scene involving a son. Darabont includes several nods to Spielberg's film: giant tripod like creatures, rolling clouds of dust/mist, family vans, ominous alien horns, military convoys etc.<br/><br/>But while both films have a similar structure, both artists have completely different interests. Spielberg loves building action sequences. Darabont, in contrast, loves dialogue and characters. While ""The Mist's"" action sequences and CGI effects are pretty inept, the human interactions are quite riveting. For Darabont, human beings can be as bad or worse than the alien nightmares that hunt them. He's interested in mob dynamics and how human beings regress and organise themselves under extreme stress.<br/><br/>Darabont also rights the wrong at the end of Spielberg's film. While Spielberg couldn't resist bringing Tom Cruise's son back to life, Darabont has his hero shoot his own son dead. Better to die to a family bullet than at the hands of the enemy.<br/><br/>With this killing, ""The Mist"" presents the flip-side of Darabont's earlier film, ""The Shawshank Redemption"". ""Shawshank"" was about maintaining hope in the face of adversity. ""The Mist"" is about the consequences of losing hope.<br/><br/>In ""Shawshank"", Tim Robbins begins to despair, but slowly regains faith. In ""Mist"", the hero loses all hope and kills his family in order to ease their suffering. After their death, he learns that they would have been saved had they remained hopeful just several minutes longer.<br/><br/>Tim Robbin's has become a sort of a poster-boy for Christian fundamentalists, who see his trials in ""Shawshank"" as a kind of Christian suffering. He's persecuted, but faithfully absorbs his worldly punishment. He knows that if he waits just a bit longer, he'll be freed from prison and rewarded for his faith. In ""The Mist"", the main ""evil"" in the film is a crazy woman (Marcia Gay Harden) who uses fear as a religious tool. If the townsfolk have faith in her, she says, they will be freed from the evil monsters. Ironically, at the end of the film, this crazy woman is shown to be right. The townsfolk who obey her, ultimately survive.<br/><br/>But Darabont's point is that hope is a natural thing and should not be prostituted to religion. Religious hope requires prerequisites (ie following a murderous, crazy lady). So the film presents two scenarios, and labels them both wrong. Following the crazy lady is wrong (patriotism/religious indoctrination) and giving up all hope is wrong (defeatism/suicide). Thus, Darabont is drawing us toward the third option. The townsfolk would have survived, had they simply stayed quietly in the store, like Tim Robbins, silently hopeful. <br/><br/>But Darabont isn't only preaching hopeful inaction. He preaches hopeful action as well, by inserting a symbolic mother figure who bravely steps out into the Mist, hoping to find her child. Significantly, everyone in the group refused to help this mother. She stands alone, and thus has the strongest faith. At the end of the film, we see her with her child.<br/><br/>The fact that Christians have protested this film and shown great disappointment in the way the Marcia Gay Hayden character was treated, just goes to show how successful Darabont was in countering their false reading of ""The Shawshank Redemption"".<br/><br/>8/10 - Shot on a low budget using a cheap TV crew, ""The Mist"" works as a cross between ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""War of the Worlds"". Yes, the CGI ""action sequences"" are crap, but the human drama is pretty effective. PS- the film needs to be watched in black and white, as originally intended. It's far more effective when viewed this way.<br/><br/>Worth two viewings."
"robert_de_brose","10","3","7","26 July 2008"," The Mist is a metaphor
","When I see the Mist coming over the city, in the movie, I cannot help thinking about the mist that surrounded people close to WTC when it collapsed in that awful day in November 2001. From that mist too monsters, desperation and hopelessness have spread all over America and, fed by lies and fear, they haunted and preyed upon humans all over the globe, luring them into accepting any promise of salvation that could give them hope of safety. Since then how many innocent lives have been sacrificed to appease the Moloch our leaders have made us believe in? how much have we surrendered of our freedom and our rights into the hands of others we thought might give us some solace and guidance in dark times? and how terribly we have been deceived! The Mist has not been lifted yet, and it does not hover over only one country, over America only, it enshrouds us all and it bids us enter it and see for ourselves and take our chances rather than believing in the messiah next door. When all lights go out the only hope we have is to try to illuminate the path with the light of our reason and our humanity, which pays no regard to borders or countries."
"kabeile","9","3","7","21 July 2008"," I was really blown away!!!
","I just watched THE MIST on DVD and I was totally blown away, by what I had just seen. First I have to say, that it was probably good, that I knew nearly nothing about this movie. The only thing I knew, was (from a TV-trailer) that it was about a father and his son, hiding with other people in a supermarket from unknown things in the mist outside. <br/><br/>I can tell you - knowing this was enough for me, not to go to the cinema to watch this one. The first ""no-go"" was the ""Stephen King's"" in the headline: How many good movies have you seen, that were based on King's books or short stories? One (""THE SHINING"") or two (""MISERY"") good ones out of thousands that were really bad. The second reason was, that the plot sounded like a bad mixture of ""THE FOG"" and ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" (because of the supermarket...). So I first didn't even think about watching this one on DVD. - MAN, WAS I WRONG!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>THE MIST is one of the best horror/thriller/whatever - let's call it ""suspense-movies"" I have seen in years. Not only was it gripping, nicely shot and well acted - also the development of the characters and the issues that were raised in the context (group dynamics in a closed setting under fear, the threat of religious bigots...) of this movie were really on top of its genre.<br/><br/>I won't say too much about the glorious but also tragic ending. I think for me it only worked so well, because (as I said) I hadn't read anything about this movie. So I was expecting something completely different (and really boring) such as a dumb end-fight or the self-sacrifice of the father. The final conclusion came totally unexpected and made the film even more worth watching (you know - dumb endings sometimes can spoil a good film in the end, or leave you with a foul aftertaste in your mouth...)!<br/><br/>The only thing that can be criticized, is that there is some bad cgi in a couple of scenes and that some parts could have been even more thrilling, if you wouldn't have seen the monsters (or parts of them) so early and so clearly. <br/><br/>To sum it up: A great movie, that I can highly recommend."
"predator72","7","3","7","8 July 2008"," Not as good as the novella but that doesn't matter
","First, to get a few of my gripes out the way. Firstly, I wish there could be more build up. In the book we get a lot more conversation between Drayton and his wife which makes him a more developed character. Also, we get one of my favourite scenes: the live electric wires. The importance this has to the later themes of danger and risk would have worked really well in a movie. Finally, an extended build-up would give us the time to really locate the movie. That would have made the conflict between locals and out-of-towners more concrete; something that was really glossed in the film. Secondly, I feel Norton was miscast. He just isn't dislikable. It's not like Darabont was concerned about the rating: Stephen King's dialogue really makes Norton dislikable; whereas in the film, he is one of the weakest characters. Finally, sometimes the film felt like it was moving from set-piece to set-piece. Some slower, more sinister scenes would have brought out the menace of the novella. However, with the exception of a few pointless scenes, such as the romance, this is a pretty darn good horror. When I first read the novella, my thought was that this would be really hard to pull off as a movie: how do you not make the monsters not become farcical by about half-way through? The obvious answer, and the answer Darabont takes, is to focus on the human conflict going on. Personally, I think there was still too much focus on the monsters sometimes, but hey, a director's gotta satisfy the immature 15 year olds on the market. This is a pretty scary ride, in a 'Stephen King movie' way (Carrie, Green Mile etc - looking at the scary side of the human psyche). The emotional intensity is carried through by great camera work.<br/><br/>However, at the end of the day, most of the success of this movie is down to Stephen King's original vision. The new ending is as good as the old. But beyond that, Darabont hasn't really added anything."

","Stephen King's ""The Mist"" is probably one of the better adaptations in the last decade. It has great actors, a great storyline (almost exactly like the original story), a great script, and great views on life.<br/><br/>David Drayton and his son go to the grocery store after a horrible storm knocks out their boathouse and part of their house. While in the store, a mist engulfs everything and a man warns everyone that there's something in the mist. That's when everything spirals downhill for the characters.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane delivers an amazing performance as a leader, a hero, and a caring, protective father. He shows both strong sides and weak sides to his character.<br/><br/>Nathan Gamble, who plays the son, gives us a true, believable performance of a child experiencing the horrifying scenes being shown to him. Even though he is young, he is a very respected actor in my book. Dakota Fanning could use some lessons from him.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden, as Mrs. Carmody, might remind some of Jack from ""Lord of the Flies"". She uses her character to show that religion might not always be the right way to turn in difficult situations (no offense).<br/><br/>The script was great (with a few exceptions in the beginning of the movie with some bad dialog). The ending, though different from Stephen King's, was almost traumatizing to watch; however, it's also one of the more reasonable/probable endings.<br/><br/>The CGI is kind of bad unfortunately. At the beginning, it is laughable, but by the end you don't notice it as much.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Mist"" is an amazing movie that will make you think deeper while being mind-blowingly scary. ***** out of *****"

I love the Kings work, but this let me wondering , what was wrong with him to end a movie this way. I will go see the next big thing he puts out . I am a fan of the kings works.

","Simply amazing. I too watch dozens of films a month. Every once in a while I come across a truly amazing gem. This was one of those gems.<br/><br/>This wasn't a film about horror. The horror veil is there merely as a medium for King's work, as other posters have iterated. It was a message, a glimpse as it were, of our own society in one of its darkest moments. The entire broad spectrum of humanity played out in this one single film. Bravo! to the director, screenwriter and all the other people involved for a brilliant adaptation of a story I must read one day.<br/><br/>Day to day life is nothing more than one ""challenge"" after the other. How we deal with these challenges, is what define us as human beings. What keeps us going, from challenge to challenge, is hope. Steven King's message to us was a simple one - never lose it."
"njadric","4","3","7","17 May 2008"," Cliché movie for the masses
","Now, i have to believe Stephen King didn't write this. That is, the director (movie script writer) did a bad job making the novella into a movie. It's so full of clichés, it's basically a cliché movie.<br/><br/>Not knowing what the movie was supposed to be, it takes bits from so many different sci-fi horror movies. Made to please the casual viewer... Let's see: there are monsters which look, act and sound the same in dozens of other movies, a pretty standard main character (tall, dark athletic male with family), army experiment went wrong, a stubborn guy who always manages to find people like him,... The list goes on. Oh, and not to forget the tall as a house monster which is waiting for someone to leave the building, but just can't seem to figure out how to brake a glass window for a human treat. Then there's bugs coming out of bodies which are enveloped in some web...<br/><br/>All in all, it's an OK movie. Not very scary, quite predictable in fact. Maybe because it's structure came mail-ordered from a company named ""Sci-fi horror movies script - Now with standardized variations"".<br/><br/>I'm saying, watch the movie (it is a bit too long, although) and if you turn of your thoughts, you will enjoy it. However, Stephen King should not be pleased with this adaptation. It just... Should have been better."

","SPOILER ALERT: Before you read any further, I'm going to talk about the ending. If you don't want to know how it ends turn back now. You have been warned.<br/><br/>I loathed the ending of this book. Not only was it inconsistent with the King ending, it was inconsistent with the characters. They were willing to fight and sacrifice, but in the end they just give up? No try for gas? No one willing to wait it out and shoot when the end was in sight? Especially the father - how do you shoot your own son? How do you not die trying to save him after risking your life three times for near strangers? It just made me mad. I'm sure that some think it is 'cool' for a movie not to have a happy ending, but there was nothing satisfying in watching a man snuff his own son after zero effort to try anything else. It was one very disappointing night."
"mhmunim-1","10","3","7","26 April 2008"," Rarely do you see films of this calibre (May Contain Spoilers)
","It very rare that I give a film a 10 out of 10 and it is even rare that I feel compelled to comment upon it. Yesterday I watched this film and have to admit for the two hours I was held captive by the tense and suspense rich story line. The director has done a fantastic job of bringing Stephen Kings story to the screen.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago I watched Cloverfield which left me pleasantly surprised at how good it was, I can honestly say this film has topped it. Usually when a film has monsters they tend to be cheesy puppets of or shoddy CGI, I'm glad to say that the creatures in this film were amazingly designed and displayed. Like Cloverfield the monsters wern't the main focus of the film but the how they came to be was scary nonetheless, mankind destroying themselves by playing with things they have no control over.<br/><br/>Putting the monsters aside for a second like cloverfield, the film really concentrated more on the human emotions. At the beginning we see the common urge to band together against an unknown enemy but then come to realise how that erodes as fear sets in. Its message is without structure and rule men resorts to their primal urge and yearns for anyone or anything that can bring some reason to the madness no matter how tenuous.<br/><br/>The film works simply because of the impacting story it tells of peoples emotions namely love, fear and anger. What would any of us do in a situation like that, are we truly animals when common society laws and rules no longer apply.<br/><br/>The most hated character in the story for me was the religious fanatic who at the beginning everyone ignored but as things became worse how she slowly became the leader of an unthinking mob and claiming that God spoke through her. How she uses God to wreak her personal hatred and flame cruelty to the people she should have been helping. Her ultimate fate I believe in my own opinion was truly deserved.<br/><br/>The soundtrack they used ""The Host of Seraphim"" made my heart ache when it was coupled with the cinematography, rarely have I seen something so beautiful and haunting.<br/><br/>The main character of the film was simply a father trying to protect his son and then later help everyone in general. Thomas Zane in this role really excelled and you can't help but feel for him at the end of the film when he realises in the midst of hope he destroyed everything he had. I pray that none of us ever has to make the choice he made.<br/><br/>To conclude this film is beyond exceptional the story told made me hope that if ever I was in a situation like that then I would pray that I made the right decisions"

That's all I will say on the ending. <br/><br/>So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, and if you were worried I might tell you something you didn't want to know then, rest assured, that's all I will say on the ending. <br/><br/>As for the movie, this is a VERY good film. <br/><br/>The acting is superb, you could totally connect with the people, and you genuinely worry about them. These people are very real people. I'm an avid Stephen King fan, and I have always been amazed at how SK depicts people and their personalities, and this movie stays very Stephen King the whole duration. <br/><br/>I absolutely enjoyed how all the characters interacted, and how they changed. For better or for worse. <br/><br/>About the gore. Oh, man. I was horrified. A killer horror film. i was cringing, shouting, covering my eyes, and going 'ewww'. If you like a good horror film, man, this is for you. <br/><br/>The story, YES. VERY good. As I've already stated, very good characters doing exactly what their character should do if they were in that situation. Nothing is too shallow, nothing is too superficial, nothing is too Hollywood. There is a sense of realism there that just sucks you into the story. Although most Stephen King stories aren't too realistic, they do have the realism that puts you right there on the scene. Whether it be through his writing, or through a good director who can translate it into a good movie. I believe that is what happened here. <br/><br/>If you are sick of Hollywood horror, and sick of 'the cute chick can live' plots, and sick of everything magically taken care of for no reason, and sick of shallow characters, and sick of 'you got to show some boobs in a horror flick' mentality (although boobs never hurt anyone, they are overdone) then this is the movie for you. <br/><br/>This movie made me back into a believer of good horror films. Yes, it can still be done. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, go watch it. trust me, if you like horror, you will love this one."

Horrible deaths, murders, unbelievers, and a father's all-encompassing love for his son all make their fair showing.<br/><br/>The movie was great. I've read the story and the movie wonderfully adapted it to the screen, almost scene for scene.<br/><br/>I believe it accurately captured the look of the ""creatures"" based on how I imagined them, too.<br/><br/>The location was spot-on to what my brain had conjured, also.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden surprised me with her exceptional portrayal of Mrs. Carmody, eagerly devolving (evolving?) from simple troublesome fear-monger to fire and brimstone Inquisition prophet.<br/><br/>A few things were missing such as the radio that David found his ""hope"" on (which guided the written ending), the fact that he actually makes it back to his house and finds out what happened to his wife, and he actually saw what the thing with the gigantic legs looked like. But the ending... ouch. The novella left everything open, folks driving toward a possible, or possibly not a last bastion of humanity and safety. That's a Stephen King ending. No explanation. No resolution.<br/><br/>The movie holy sh*t it slapped me in the face with the ending. It was probably the most cliché part of the movie and it hurt to watch it in more ways than one. I was totally not expecting it to end the way it did.

And the movie would end.<br/><br/>The tank shows up AND THE MIST CLEARS!<br/><br/>What? What? Are you serious? He runs out of gas at precisely the spot and at precisely the time that the military is going to be coming by about 15 minutes later? Just long enough for him to form the suicide pact and kill everyone and have them show up 30 seconds later? The military saving the f*cking day with flame throwers and gas masks? Holy sh*t! The woman who left the store to get to her eight year old kid actually survived? How? She walked through the mist? What's wrong with you?<br/><br/>The mist f*cking goes away just like that?

I feel cheated, so here is a real review.<br/><br/>I really like Stephen King and I was looking forward to an unusual story with a couple twists and turns. It's unusual for sure, but the plot wears thin very quickly, as we quickly learn there isn't one, other than that the cast are trapped in a supermarket surrounded by a bizarre mist and outside there are creepy crawlies who kill people mercilessly if they come outside.<br/><br/>The point of story (I think) is to show how mob mentality develops and how a scared crowd will follow anybody who can explain something terrifying they don't understand. In actual fact the characters are just way too over the top to suspend disbelief. The silly arguments just add to the tedium, and on occasion they are so contrived they provoke laughter.<br/><br/>The tempo is slow and there were plenty of yawns from the audience. For those who stick it out, there is a twist at the end, and it's never been done before (with good reason), but frankly, it doesn't do the story any favours. The ending is just too bad to describe. Go and see this movie if you are a fan of bad horror flicks. If you are looking for a story with a moral or a point then this is definitely not for you."

So now you how I feel about this writer/director combination, going in to this film.<br/><br/>My expectations were modest, and they were greatly exceeded. This is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time! I would rank it up with Misery and The Shining as the best of the Stephen King adaptations.<br/><br/>I found myself very much drawn in to the story, very uncertain and fascinated by what would happen to the protagonists. The obviously-computer-generated monsters didn't spoil things too much because ultimately their menace proves to be secondary. Director Frank Darabont has the good sense to allow strong writing and acting to trump the slightly-above-average special effects.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is well-cast in the lead. I don't quite buy him as an artist, but he is very effective as the slightly vulnerable alpha male, trying to get himself and his young son out of a nasty predicament. Marcia Gay Harden plays one of the most odious villains you will ever see on screen, every bit as loathsome as Kathy Bates in Misery.<br/><br/>For the two hours this movie ran, time was suspended for me.

The dynamics and changes that occur over this time relate to the human need to survive, even if certain questionable actions are sanctioned to meet this imperative.<br/><br/>That said, Frank Darabount's adaptation of the Stephen King novelette, meets the criteria of a scary, even disturbing view into the dark side of human nature, and has monsters and creepy crawly things that are very threatening. The ensemble cast was convincing for the most part. I had moments of trepidation when Thomas Jane's character was in sorrow in pivotal emotional moments, but for the most part did well in the lead.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend it for its watch-ability, scary situations, and it's a must see if you enjoy downer endings, (man this one's got a doozey)."

","I was expecting great things from the Mist. As a young boy, the short Stephen King novel was one of those stories that I read time and time again. Even back then, I can remember thinking ""This would be great on the screen!!!"". OK, admittedly, I knew it would lose some of it's worth when transferred out of the pages and into the box office, but as an already formed idea, it was hard to see how anyone could mess it up. But they did. And oh my, how they messed it up.<br/><br/>From a pretty promising start, The Mist soon descends to the typical book/movie crossover - i.e: Trash. I keep asking myself, how did the director manage to screw this up so badly?<br/><br/>The characters are poorly formed and although the acting is OK, there are times when one feels so infuriated by the character development, it spoils the whole movie. Honestly, I couldn't care less what happened to anyone in the store. And did we really need so much focus on Christian fundamentalism? It's such an over-riding factor in this movie, it almost blurs the rest of the plot. When I watch a movie like The Mist, I want to be frightened, I want to be thrilled, I don't want to be sitting in my seat fighting back the urge to vomit at some pathetically veiled stab at religion. If religion or fundamentalism is a problem for the director, I have a message for him - GO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT IT. DO NOT USE IT TO SPOIL A GREAT IDEA. YOU WERE GIVEN A GIFT. A SURE THING. YOU DROPPED THE BALL.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the CGI was OK. Other people may rave about it in this review forum but I really can't say that it was anything that held my attention for too long. Most of the story was true to the original, although again, there were times when the poor character development made you wonder how people got themselves into certain predicaments - for example, people being led out to their certain death with hardly any coaxing.<br/><br/>But then we come to the biggest negative in this movie. The ending. Even if this had been a great movie (which it wasn't), the ending would have destroyed any positivity that came before. Some people may see it as clever, I just see it as a massive cop-out. Not only that, but not even a particularly smart one. Maybe there was a message in there somewhere as some have stated - but the message to me read ""Ever Been Cheated? You have now"".<br/><br/>All in all, I give The Mist a massive thumbs down. It could have been something great. Really it could have. But instead, it's a mess. I couldn't even recommend it as a popcorn movie - it isn't even mindless entertainment. Just a great idea that became overwhelmed by somebody's misguided urge to try and look smart."

","A friend and I watched this, somewhat skeptical, King flicks tend to get slaughtered sometimes, and I was STILL not over how horribly Tommyknockers, one of my very favorite King novels, turned out.<br/><br/>The Mist did not disappoint though. Being from Maine, the characters and plot and setting seemed very familiar, even as the situation inside the supermarket degenerates and people flock to the crazy bible lady. I know it's only a movie, and not to say bad things about back home, but the way the people stupidly followed the crackpot seemed just a little TOO real, for me anyway. It hit too close to home. I could, HAVE seen people back home react this way in situations. And it scared the hell out of me. This movie made me shake uncontrollably. That just doesn't happen to me. King is a very astute observer of people.<br/><br/>This was a true horror movie. The creatures were radical. King's exploration of how different people react and interact in crisis only amplified the suspense and terror.<br/><br/>There were several themes to this flick, a little of The Tommyknockers-style messing-with-technology-you-don't understand, after all, this happened because of the military and their experiments with other dimensions. How different people interpret things based on how superstitious they are, how little it takes for seemingly reasonable people to become monsters...<br/><br/>It wasn't bad enough to be surrounded by an array of hungry prehistoric-looking creatures from another dimension. We find ourselves trapped in a supermarket with bible-thumping superstitious sheep. Myself, I would have been one of the first out the door, like the guy who's lower torso was pulled back on the rope. Seriously, it's preferable to being trapped in a supermarket with the religious nuts.<br/><br/>""God demands a blood-sacrifice!"" The dual-terror is unbearable. I can't help see the similarities in the almost incomprehensible monsters, and the people turning to superstition and violence, and I think this was King's intention - to show how similarly incomprehensible and horrible they are. The creatures were outside, AND inside, in a way...<br/><br/>The ending was too horrible for me though, too upsetting. I know it's just a movie, and I know it's irony, but I can still hear the screaming, the screaming of a man who's just shot four people, including his own son, essentially sacrificing himself by using the remaining 4 bullets to spare the others from being killed by the creatures, a very selfless and noble thing to do. Which turns to terror a few moments later, as the rescuers finally arrive, too late. Screaming, screaming, I can still hear his screaming...<br/><br/>This is true horror."
"whatsupdoc_55","10","3","7","24 February 2008"," Instant Classic! Pleasant surprise! Darabont & King rule!
","I went to see this movie on a day when I just wanted to go out. I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a fantastic horror movie. It has everything a fan could want in it: great visual effects, creepy mood, scares, suspense, dramatic tension, & a few delightful surprises & twists. I genuinely got caught up in the mood and was scared! One word of advice, to get the full effect, you'll want to see it on a BIG SCREEN -- either, in the theater or on a High Definition Big Screen TV. That way, the atmosphere will surround you and you'll enjoy the full effect of the horror; the same goes for SOUND. This is one of those pictures when surround sound really makes a difference, adding to the feeling of claustrophobia and being ""surrounded"" by a dangerous evil. It is directed flawlessly. The director, Frank Darabont, works well with Mr. King and elevates the story to top quality in every respect. Darabont, as a filmmaker, has a way of visualizing things which is equal to King's power as a writer. Their 3 projects together so far (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Mist) testify to this. I found it as enjoyable as I did ""The Green Mile,"" their last collaboration. The DVD is #1 on my Wish List. This movie does not disappoint. I consider it an instant classic & must see. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

","Okay I lied, there is some gore!! But King and Darabond bring the thrills of the unknown and a psychologically enthralling roller coaster ride, to movie theaters near you! Rivaling the intensity of The Shining and with the creeps of 28 Days Later, I am noting this movie as one of my favorites! Incredible cinematography and sociological undertones.<br/><br/>The characters develop with entertaining intensity and the plot thickens, the doom sets in, you feel their desperation and fear. A villain is effectively made, yet it as obvious, as you might suspect! The end of the movie isn't for Disney fans, yet a lot of moral lessons can be learned from analyzing the characters interactions. Facing adversity is a daunting task, and this movie not only inspires but renews my faith in modern Hollywood."

","BING-O! After sitting through some mediocre Stephen King adaptations this month, I wasn't expecting much from this. Well, holey dooley! ""The Mist"" is easily my favorite movie of the year, and maybe my favorite horror of the 00's. I cannot remember the last time I left a movie theater feeling so depressed, emotionally exhausted, and just plain drained (127 minutes long!) because I was so invested in the movie I was watching--and a horror movie to boot! ""The Mist"" is R-rated horror for grown-ups: no shaky came here, no annoying teen TV stars, no bad dialogue, and no obnoxious music. At the half hour point, I was turned off by some Sci-Fi channel caliber CGI and I wasn't sure I was going to like where the movie was headed. But it was only uphill from there. I wish that scene was shot differently, but the FX throughout the rest of the movie were impressive and really it's just a perfect horror apart from that. Thomas Jane is flippin' awesome as always, but Marcia Gay Harden is the real star here. She takes a role that anyone else would turn into an irritating caricature and she NAILS it. It's really one of the most brilliant genre performances I've seen in a long time. Too bad ""The Mist"" appears to be a bomb at the box office. It could have set a precedent for well-written and mature scary movies filling our multiplexes. Oh well. It'll be a cult classic in a few years time."

","I liked this film a lot. It built up the suspense really well. Al of the creatures in the mist are creepy as hell. All of the scenes with these creatures are really disturbing and kept me on the edge of my seat for sure. really scary stuff. I read the novella a few years back and really liked it a lot. I was really happy to see that one of Stephen kings horror novels has transitioned well to the big screen. I really really really hope that Frank will continue to direct King's stuff. He really does it justice. With that said, i thought the ending was very good, for all you wussies out there who felt like it was sacrilegious or some BS like that. I think King's ending was good, leaving things ambiguous, but i also liked this ending too. I'm glad to see that some really good horror movies are coming out recently. I feel like this one worked perfectly in building up the horror, and it really draws you into the characters, which is essential to a horror movie if you really want to build suspense. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good horror movie."
"paul-2686","2","5","15","13 May 2008"," stilted attempted to be a ""deep"" horror film
","Hard to believe this is the same director who gave us Shawshank! I wish Darabont had just tried to entertain/scare us, instead of trying to add depth to this horror film. The characters are all paper-thin walking clichés, but not for lack of trying to make something more out of them  trying much too hard. Most of them talk like they are trying to make a philosophical point to the audience.<br/><br/>Much of the action of the film concerns their shocking degeneration under pressure, and this is one of the main complaints about the film I've read in other comments: people don't think that's realistic. But that's not the problem.<br/><br/>Here in Vancouver in 2006ish, we had a ""boil water advisory,"" and ACTUAL FIST FIGHTS broke out at local stores over bottled water. Fist fights! There was no actual water shortage mind you ... we were just supposed to boil before drinking it. But people actually attacked each other. For real. Welcome to the human race. We really DO get violently bonkers under pressure.<br/><br/>So the crazy human behaviour wasn't really the problem with the film. But the plausible psychology doesn't forgive clumsy, irritating dialogue, plus several other problems:<br/><br/>* Generally goofy-lookin' monsters. Too rubbery! Can't we do better than that these days?<br/><br/>* Inconsistent monster powers! Monsters that can rip some poor guy's chest off ... but then a moment later can hold 'em off with a broomstick!<br/><br/>* Giant spiders? Really? Arg. It's been years since I read it, but I could pretty much swear that there were NOT giant spiders in the novella.<br/><br/>* The old monsters coming out of the body cliché is irritating enough in any movie that isn't Alien(s), but this film did NOT need to do that, and actually went out of its WAY to do it. Groan.<br/><br/>* Completely irrational ""don't go in there"" character choices.<br/><br/>Etc. Just a bunch of stereotypical lame horror movie stuff ... with a failed attempt to be deep and meaningful spread all over it."
"guidon7","1","5","15","8 December 2007"," Gruesome and Gory
","A little background here. I first became an avid film fan nigh on to 70 years ago and it is perhaps due to the changes between generations that there appears to be a wide gap between what I perceive to be a good film and what today's viewers accept as such, this at least shown by the glowing praise from viewers here (I have not read all the comments, however). After the 1930's/1940's my attendance began to decrease to the point that in 2007 I have seen only two films. The second was ""The Mist"", and the reason I wanted to see it is that I read Stephen King's story a number of years ago and believed it to be then, as I do now, one of his best efforts. As I remember the storyline, this film generally follows it, if my memory serves me correctly. However, I was repelled by the filthy cursing throughout, by the extreme violence, and the fact that it is nothing but a bloody butcher's pen to boot. Undoubtedly, the main purpose of this film is to shock the audience, and although it may not have as much effect on today's ""conditioned"" moviegoers, it certainly was successful in my case -- I was disturbed by it for some time afterward. Certainly horror writer Stephen King is by no means a stranger to blood and violence but I can't recall reading any of his writings as manifestly gruesome as this film.<br/><br/>Also, the Christian religious fanatic, reading passages from her bible and inducing her adherents to kill, could very well be construed by some as an anti-religious/anti-Christian message aimed at the audience.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would like to have something positive to say about this film, and in this regard I would mention only the special effects, gruesome as they were. However, it is my earnest hope that there may be some rating attached to ""The Mist"" that will at least prevent children from viewing this extremely disturbing film with no redeeming qualities."

"claudemercure","8","4","11","6 April 2008"," excellent horror film marred by misguided ending
","Stephen King hasn't had much luck at the movies. I think the main reason is that the movie people usually get distracted by the flashy scary stuff in his stories, and entirely miss the careful characterization that makes readers care about what happens.<br/><br/>They didn't forget about it this time, though. I wouldn't call myself a Frank Darabont fan (director of two other King-based films – Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile). The first two times, he took solid stories and rendered them mushy and cliché-ridden (I realize I won't make a lot of friends around these parts with that statement). The Mist isn't perfect, but it doesn't suffer from those flaws. For most of its running time, it's an excellent horror movie – intense, and grounded by realistic performances and dialogue. (Plus some cool creatures.) But it does stumble at least twice. The first time occurs when a bunch of characters have a conversation the purpose of which is to tell the audience about the movie's subtext. Thanks, Frank. I mean, we are idiots, after all.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem is the misguided ending (what follows discusses tone but doesn't spoil specific plot points). I don't care that Darabont deviated from the original story (I'm not a stickler for ""faithfulness""), but what he comes up with fails on multiple levels. The final moment of Twilight Zone-style heavy-handed irony is bad enough. But just before that, Darabont gives us a scenario that strains credibility so badly (the level of the characters' despair does not remotely justify their actions) that it becomes obvious it was contrived purely for shock value. Adding insult to injury, he seems to think he can pass off his cheap shock ending as something deep simply by slathering Dead Can Dance's portentous ""The Host of Seraphim"" all over the tail end of the soundtrack (it's a great tune, but out of place here). Instead, it only serves to expose the pretensions of someone who would try to infuse a giant-bug movie with unearned depth.<br/><br/>So, this is a very good scary movie... if you tune out in time."

Turns out there is something very toxic about the mist, but I wont spoil it.<br/><br/>The acting is good, film quality high, It has realistic people and tension, and very few vomit inducing scenes where parents drool over their kids (a few but they get a pass) In most of these types of films, they start off OK, a couple of bad guys die or get tortured, but then devolve into a Lifetime network ""ITS FOR THE CHILDREN"" story, when the FAMILY and the CHILDREN walk off into the sunset, having defeated the evil doers, violins blazing. Gaag.<br/><br/>This is the only American horror flick I recall seeing recently that doesn't CHICKEN OUT at the end. We see the characters develop, the good guy with the kid, the independent bitchy chic, the smart black guy, the a hole guy, and the nutcase. They fight together and with each other in a realistic way. <br/><br/>I am blown away by the way the writers didn't leave their nuts at home when they filmed the ending.

The writers felt they had to give the movie closure, for the viewer, when anyone who has read the story would know not to expect much closure. By doing what they did, they ruined the movie, and made it a worthless addition to Stephen's repertoire. If I were Stephen, I would deny ever having been part of this movie. It's meant to scare the crap out of you, not make you believe in alien creatures. They're so much scarier when we don't know what they look like. So yeah, not a fan of the movie."

","I am a HUGE Frank Darabont fan. ""Shawshank Redemtion"" and ""The Green Mile"" are two of my all-time favourite movies. But I was terribly disappointed in this movie. I'll begin with what most people will remember and/or praise: the ending. I think it was VERY predictable (I swear I knew what was going to happen as soon as I counted the rounds) and it really didn't have any Impact on me at all. The whole deus ex machina ending was lazy and really kind of stupid. Now why didn't the ending have any impact? Because I couldn't have cared less about the characters. I think they were all shallow and I didn't care with them or care for them. The performances were mediocre at best. I don't think that bad cgi means a worse watching experience but I wanted to note that the special effects were rather bad and heartless. The whole movie was alright to watch, but I didn't have any connection to it and labeling it as ""horror"" or even a ""thriller"", is quite the exaggeration. The hand-held camera (which I see praised a lot) is nothing special and kind of sloppy, although one could argue it fits the surroundings. All in all I don't understand this movie's rating at all. Not really worth watching."
"johnny10-204-45246","9","2","4","5 January 2015"," Surreal and nerve-wracking. A horror movie that really works
","This film passed me by until recently when i caught it on DVD. From the opening frame however, i found myself locked into it and remained so throughout. When the first creature appeared however, I nearly rolled my eyes in despair as it seemed a bit too obviously CGI, but it quickly got better very quickly and the rest of the creatures were extremely effective and really quite terrifying. Many people on here have commented upon the ending and i have to say that it caught me by surprise and was very shocking and upsetting. I do however feel it was a bit rushed but can appreciate the dilemma the director was under as if he had dragged it out it would have lost a lot of its impact, so it was a rather brave move on his behalf. My main gripe is in thomas janes wooden performance. He kinda gets away with it throughout the film but the ending needed more passion and anquish and he didn't doesn't produce it. The ending therefore is both flawed and very effective. It certainly stays with you after the film has ended though thats for sure.<br/><br/>What i loved about this film was the ultra-surreal and dark atmosphere it captures. The grainy looking cinemaphotography and hand-held camera work has much to do with this and a fine job was done by those guys. The sense of hopelessness is palpable and the image of the gigantic creature walking across the landscape, in combination with the stunning musical soundtrack, has surely got to be the most Gothic moment ever created in a film. A real 'end-of-the-world' scenario which is extremely gripping and moving. All in all then, apart from a few gripes, this is a really interesting piece of work and highly recommended."

The movie depicts a realistic image of what happens when people are caged in a store by the unknown.

"asda-man","8","2","4","5 January 2013"," Primeval with the cast from the Walking Dead
","Of course I'm joking with that above statement! For those of you who don't know, Primeval is an incredibly bad TV show in the UK about dinosaurs that come out of worm hole thingies and a bumbling group of secret service people go out to dispatch of the beasts humanely. It's really bad, uses every cliché in the book and has most definitely run its course. The Mist surprised me, although I wouldn't call it one the greatest horror films of the decade, it's certainly one of the greatest creature features, but I could think of at least 20 horror films (I think) that are better than this one that came out between the years 2000 and 2010.<br/><br/>The Mist is sort of like a very well-made B-movie, and I mean that in the nicest possible way. We all know what happens, a bunch of people get trapped in a supermarket as a dangerously thick mist engulfs the town. It would be stupid to leave anyway because you could'nt see where you're going, but it would be even more stupid to leave after Dale from the Walking Dead (beardless!) runs in screaming that there's something in the mist which took someone! Everyone's sceptical, but a few more people are not when they get a rather nasty surprise in the store room! Some people may completely disregard The Mist as being silly, but these people simply do not know how to have fun. Who can't say they weren't entertained when the supermarket was stormed with giant mutant fly things?<br/><br/>Besides, The Mist offers so much more than a standard creature feature. It's a comment on humanity and the state of today's society. Immediately the supermarket is segregated into different groups of race, religion and hierarchy. It's the wonderful screenplay that's the real star of the show, giving a fascinating insight into how people could and probably would act in such a situation. It's almost reminiscent of George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead or/and Day of the Dead. There's some wonderful characters who you can either root for or wish for them to get eaten (*cough* *cough* Bible nut *cough*) it's the relationships between people which mean that there's rarely a dull moment in The Mist's two hour running time. Although, I did feel that it was perhaps over-long and some of the dialogue scenes could've been reduced or cut out completely.<br/><br/>The directing is quite stylish and sometimes feels very candid, which gives the film a needed realistic edge. The CGI effects could annoy some people as they were a bit iffy at times (not as bad as Primeval!) but they're certainly not the worst effects I've seen, and they didn't distract from the film itself. Some of the beasties were quite nasty-looking and the huge ones, covered by the mist had a particularly eerie edge. I could'nt imagine (nor want to imagine) what I'd be like in that situation. I'd probably be in a corner shipping myself! There's quite a lot of beast action and it is wonderfully entertaining and refreshingly unpretentious.<br/><br/>Now, the ending wasn't as mind-blowingly shocking as most people were making out. I'd say that the endings to say, 5150 Elm's Way and Eden Lake are in respects more shocking, nevertheless for an American horror film it certainly had balls! I did really like the ending, it was unrelentlessly nasty and painfully ironic and haunting, but I would've probably liked it even more if it was less hyped up. It'll certainly put the less-experienced American viewer out of their comfort zone!<br/><br/>In the end The Mist is a hugely enjoyable creature feature with a hefty/heavy focus on people and characters. It's probably better than I imagined it to be and is much better than the disappointing Stephen King adaptation of 1408. Whilst it isn't up there with Carrie, The Shining and Misery, it can still sit in the ""very good"" category of Stephen King horror adaptations. I really enjoyed it and people who say they didn't probably secretly enjoyed it too! I would recommend that you see it, but I think that most people have seen it by now!

"LeonLouisRicci","4","2","4","1 October 2012"," Pedestrian To The Point of Ponderous
","This is nothing more than an average monster film with stereotypes and mega-stereotypes involved in a disastrous situation. You have seen this done many times and this is nothing new and the characterizations are frustratingly familiar.<br/><br/>The monsters are effective and scary enough but the tense predicament is pedestrian to the point of ponderous. The script is in trouble when you have one of the players lay out exactly what is going to happen and it happens exactly as stated. This is dumbed down and downright dumb. Not the intelligent, creative work of a movie-maker and story teller involved here.<br/><br/>There is not one surprise in the behavior of the participants or one twist that is fresh and fanciful. It is really a rather slim story, and that is mostly side stepped, and more insulting without insight than it ought to be. The ending is ridiculous and does not ring true to the characters and seems tacked on for shock. But it is, considering the rest of the unresolved plot, a typical, lazy way to make one think that it is oh so deep and oh so thought provoking. That voice far out there in the mist is Rod Serling...and he is not pleased."

","i really enjoyed this movie. just watched it for the second time since it was released. i can honestly say it is imo the best film adaption of a novella i have ever seen. the acting was just outstanding, and the horror, while tame by today's standards of goreporn. was genuine and suspenseful. i cant recommend this movie highly enough. everything just works. the ending and subplot of where the mist came from is even better then the original novella. a must watch for king fans. while the cgi does indeed not age well it is sparsely used and in fact to great effect in some instances. this is not an effects movie. it is a character movie and a what would you do kind of movie. i have seen a lot of crap made out of books to movies, and this is just above the cut. if your thinking of getting it in any form, do so. if you don't like it i will give you a dollar."
"TheOriginalBane","10","2","4","1 February 2010"," Excellent adaptation, gripping horror, and not the rubbish that some people claim
","Firstly, you may have read some other reviews slating this film. I will reply to some of the more common themes:<br/><br/>(1) Anti-Christian. Seriously, get a grip. The religious fundamentalist fanatic (not your everyday Christian) is the main foil throughout most of the movie. She discredits the new testament, slanders modern Christians, and goes against pretty much everything Christians stand for these days. This is obvious. She says it. Others say it. By that mote, you have to be purposefully ignorant to claim the film implies all Christians are like her.<br/><br/>It shows what happens when fundamentalist fanatics prey on the fears and desperation of people in an extreme situation - in this case, trapped in a mall, with a strange mist full of monsters just outside the window, and no hope of escape.<br/><br/>It does not show that Christians are just waiting for the right time to re-ignite the witch hunts. So basically, to those commenting that it IS: get a grip, and stop being so blatantly ignorant and full of self-importance that you can't see that it ISN'T.<br/><br/>(2) Bad acting I liked the acting, personally. I thought everyone did a bang up job. I particularly liked the Ms. Carmody, Ollie and Frank characters. I guess that's a matter of opinion though.<br/><br/>(3) Unrealistic This covers a number of points really, but the most commonly touted is the actions of the people in the store - from thinking it was all a joke, to going to the pharmacy, to most turning to the zealot.<br/><br/>OK, some people deny things because they cannot comprehend them being possible - this explains why the lawyer shrugged the creatures off as a joke and headed out.<br/><br/>Going to the pharmacy was a desperate act to get much needed supplies. Again, people do desperate things in desperate times.<br/><br/>When you're trapped, with no hope, and no answers, and are getting increasingly desperate, a lot of people turn to someone who claims to have the answers and solutions. Charismatic, confident people. You've heard of Hitler right? Yeah. Exactly. Also, a lot of people are saying ""they wouldn't do that after just a few hours"", or some going as far as saying ""one day"". It's two to three days, for a starts. And this situation is about as extreme as it gets - so yeah, that's easily long enough.<br/><br/>(4) The Ending This is the biggest beef, and, honestly, I can see why some don't like it. It's a real kick in the teeth, head shoved in the toilet, gut punch kind of ending. <br/><br/>The fact that minutes after running out of gas, they turn to suicide, is something that is debate-ably against character - though you have to remember they've been striving for days, have been driving for miles and hours, have witnessed the true monstrosity of the creatures (RE: massive monster towards end), the mist is seemingly never ending, Frank has found his wife has died, they've seen school buses with dead kids inside, etc. That creeps up on you. They were, I assume, also aware of the dwindling fuel as they were driving, and this gnaws at you as you slowly watch hope slip away. So I urge you not to think of it as ""omg we're going to escape, drive!"" to ""ah well, ran out of gas, BANG BANG BANG BANG"" but instead think of it as it is - the slow draining of all hope.<br/><br/>Back to the ending itself, yeah, it's nihilistic. But I liked it. I thought it fit the tone of the film, thought it was a clever, emotional ending. But again, this may be a case of opinion.<br/><br/>(5) Bad CGI OK, this is the only one I agree with on some level. I don't think it's the worst CGI since time began, as some claim, but I thought it was lacking somewhat. Not enough to make it a horrendous film, and certainly, with the strong acting, gripping tension and horror, and clever plot, it didn't dampen my enjoyment of the film at all."
"turbobond","10","2","4","12 November 2009"," Won't clean house at the Oscars, but a superb King adaptation
","On its merits as a piece of film alone, I might give it 6.5 or 7 stars, five being indifferent. But because the makers took one of my all time favorite Stephen King novellas and made it into a truly entertaining movie, I have to give this all the love at my disposal. The performances were consistently good and occasionally great -- looking at you, Nathan Gamble -- with a complete absence of cringe-worthy characters or lines. Of course the mist helps, but there were some superb bits of special effects work in there too. The writing allowed for the rapid yet effective establishment of a wide range of characters. Though more than a handful of stock conventions were employed -- light the blasted mop already! -- most were lightly weighted enough to feel more accessory than pivotal. And besides, King invented a lot of these clichÃ©s, so his movies are free to include them as far as I'm concerned. The film conveyed an even pacing that built convincingly to a series of profoundly intense mini-crescendos. At a few points in this movie, I was overcome by a visceral reaction my body usually reserves for only the most intense films, and at least once I was compelled to shout something at or with a character. You could do much worse than this movie for a horror, action or drama film to fill two hours of your life. Eagerly looking forward to the next Darabont/King collaboration."

","I'm not some weak-suck fanboy, but I loved this movie. People, it's a monster movie for pete's sake! It's not supposed to be Melville. You people seriously have nothing better to do than pick this very entertaining movie apart for gaps in logic, etc.? It's a freakin' scary movie! All you naysayers can go back to watching your pretentious art-house flicks and overrated David Fincher movies. Thomas Jane is cool, Stephen King is cool, human nature IS dark, and, if it came down to it, I would have euthanized my kid, too. The feeling of hopelessness that the Thomas Jane character was obviously feeling came across to me just fine. I like King's ending, too, but why are people to hatefully opposed to the ending we've been given in the film? Darabont was just looking to leave the audience with some closure (as King's ending might have infuriated casual movie-goers). Is everything that happened in the film logical? Of course it isn't! I'll reiterate: IT'S A FREAKIN' MONSTER MOVIE!! It's supposed to be fun, you goons! Sit back, relax, eat some nachos and watch the scary bug creatures. Stop taking everything so seriously, stop writing whiny reviews and write your own monster movie full of logical plot turns and deep, human characters. Maybe then you can please yourself and leave us fun-loving horror fans alone! And now, I stick my tongue out."
"wing6704","10","2","4","1 December 2008"," A Masterpiece
","Frank Darabont is one of the greatest storytellers of our time and this film continues to prove that. Many have judged this film harshly when it sets out to do exactly as intended. Despite low box office sales I really hope he has the chance to continue his great work.<br/><br/>I have watched both versions, the black & white cut proving more successful, to me it completes the film and I have to put it on par with the likes of, John Carpenters 'The Thing' and Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds', both films I absolutely adore. It's such a shame that the colour version removes us from the overall feel of the story, it made that much of a difference and almost destroys what could be the ultimate perfect movie experience. I have no doubt in my mind that this (Black & White) feature will mature to become one of the great Horror film classics of it's time, it's just a shame it will take time to prove it's worth.<br/><br/>Great characters, fantastic casting and superb atmosphere. I admire Frank Darabont for sticking to his guns and retaining the ending. I only wished I could have seen this in Black and White on the big screen.<br/><br/>I only wished we could have seen Darabont's Indiana Jones script on screen ;)"

Take the hardcore se7en final scene and multiply it by 10. that's what might happen to you too! Simple, devastating and completely unexpected. Be prepared for one of the most groundbreaking finale.

","In my teens I read the novella on which this film is based. It was a miserable experience which only young-reader-stamina got me through. It featured many familiar King motifs, but unlike his better novels proceeded to whomp the reader over the head with them for a good 200-300 pages.<br/><br/>The Mist the movie does exactly the same. A very VERY simple idea of a supermarket under siege by something unspeakable is dragged out over two interminable hours. Unpleasant characters squabble and bicker, no black humour is present and while there are undoubtedly parallels in modern America (the sheer glee with which your religious right hopes for apocalypse) the point is made and made and re-made to the point of redundancy.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, none of this is in the remotest frightening. There is no sense of dread in the mist, no suspense and quite honestly no point.<br/><br/>Add to this an unnecessarily grim ending, and you've got two unpleasant hours of your life passed. Yawn."

Do you really want to spend what is supposed to be a 90-minute escape listening to someone talking damnation for about 45 of those minutes? This movie provides no escape at all. It is a failed attempt at social commentary, wrapped up in the horror genre and is just not worth it, regardless of whether or not you find the ending satisfying.<br/><br/>Please do not spend a penny on this.

","""The Mist"", based on a short story by Stephen King, focuses on David Drayton (Thomas Jane), an artist who lives in a small seaside Maine town with his wife and son. After a severe storm passes, David and his son go to the local grocery store to get a few things while waiting for help. Also in the store is David's neighbor, Brent (Andre Braugher), whom he has a personal conflict with; Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a religious extremist known for being a bit loony; Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), a friendly town resident; and countless others. When one of the town locals comes screaming in the grocery store about ""something in the mist"", everyone watches in awe as a thick mist envelopes the store - a mist that carries deadly creatures with it. Trapped inside the small grocery mart in what seems to be an apocalyptic disaster, the large group of residents begin a struggle to survive the otherworldy creatures invading-- as well as survive each other.<br/><br/>One of the best horror films to come this year, ""The Mist"" is a dark and frightening story that was translated very nicely to the screen from Stephen King's original short novella. It differs from the story in places, but it sticks with the main themes. I went into this film with fairly moderate expectations, and luckily I was blown away. I typically don't go for ""creature features"" - I find them to be completely unrealistic and often quite corny. However, I felt that the creatures presented in this film, while they are monstrous and alien-like, are scary. They aren't over-done, and are presented in a manner in which they are actually frightening, unlike some obnoxious CGI creations that I've seen before in other films.<br/><br/>The film begins rather quickly, and as soon as the grocery store setting is introduced, the terror kicks in. After the mist arrives and we become aware of the monstrous creatures lurking outside, the film turns into somewhat of a character study interlaced with science-fiction/apocalyptic horror, and the combination works out perfectly. As the will to survive takes hold of each of the many people trapped together in the grocery store, they resort to desperate measures to save themselves. William Golding's literature classic ""Lord of the Flies"" immediately entered my mind while watching this, especially with the religious zealot character, Mrs. Carmody, who preaches and persuades, gaining a group of weakened followers in her fanatical beliefs. This results in a stand off between Mrs. Carmody and her followers, and the more logical characters who are searching for ways to survive. The dynamic between the characters in the film is extraordinary, and the hysteria and desperation are deep themes for a horror film.<br/><br/>Acting here is top-notch, and the cast has their work cut out for them, all playing characters pushed to the point of desperation. Thomas Jane leads the cast as our main character, a brave and protective father. Laurie Holden is excellent as the good-hearted, idealistic Amanda, and Marcia Gay Harden gives a powerful performance as the crazed Mrs. Carmody- I wanted to literally punch the woman in the face throughout the whole film, so that tells me that the collaboration of the writing and Harden's performance were doing something right. Andre Braugher (who starred in the 2004 mini-series of King's ""'Salem's Lot"") is also good as David's strong-willed neighbor. As for the film's ending - it's not ambiguous like the story's was, but I'm not sure if it was a good or bad thing. Tragic, yes, it's that for sure, as well as shocking and upsetting- but I cannot decide what my stand on it is. I suppose it's fitting, and it was cleverly written, but may be too much for some to take.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Mist"" is a powerful science-fiction thriller that most genre fans will likely enjoy. It's a tense, frightening, and claustrophobic creature-feature/horror movie - but underneath all of that, it's also an examination of the human condition when put under terrifying situations, and what group hysteria and desperation can lead people to do. All around well-acted, well-directed, and highly engrossing. The end may be a little controversial, but it was tragically and painfully clever. It's a horror movie that you won't want to miss, and it ranks as one of the best so far this year. 9/10."

","Have to add my voice to the growing throng of viewers who thought the ending spoiled an otherwise reasonably satisfying movie.<br/><br/>I read the original novella years ago and to be honest didn't care too much for its nebulous ending.<br/><br/>However, Kings original ending would have been infinitely preferable to the downbeat one tagged on this adaptation.<br/><br/>It's perfectly possible to have successful indefinite endings on movies (think ""The Birds""), and downbeat sucker punch endings can do work too (think ""The Wicker Man"", the original version). Movies do not have to have happy ending to be satisfying for the viewers, however, if a movie is going to have a downbeat ending, it ought to at least adhere to the internal logic of the movie and be consistent with the characterizations that have been developed up to that point.<br/><br/>The key point is satisfying for the viewer. Such is not the case with this movie. The ending makes you leave the theater sickened, depressed, wanting to slap the director, and wishing you could turn the hands of time back to before you saw it so you could forget it.<br/><br/>Spoiler: It might have been possible to end the movie with David Drayton wandering off into the Mist looking for something to kill him after he'd used up the (conveniently) last four bullets putting everybody (including his son) out of their misery (not that they were miserable really, just trapped in a truck), maybe. Even though this ending would have the Drayton character going against everything he stood for in the previous two hours of the film and even though it goes against the survivor-ist mentality of the rest of the people in the car and woefully disregards their ability to siphon gas from other roadside vehicles, or get some from abandoned gas pumps, etc... That ending might have worked if handled deftly. Unfortunately Darabont takes it one step further and literally rubs salt in the wounds by having the army show up moments after Drayton has pulled his Jonestown stunt, so the one character whom you've followed from the beginning of the film is driven hopelessly insane by his own actions - cute huh?<br/><br/>Consider the many reviewers that have given this movie one star simply because the ending was so bad. I have to agree. Were it not for the ending, I would be giving the a seven or an eight.<br/><br/>What kind of an audience was used to test market this? If Darabonts intention was to sicken and depress and instill hatred for the director in his audience, then he was successful. As far as I'm concerned, the only entertainer who was able to pull that trick off successfully was Andy Kauffman."

"PWNYCNY","6","4","12","22 November 2007"," Devine retribution or just a stupid accident? Also, beware of the final five minutes.
","Let's discuss the ending of this movie. Without revealing the details of the ending, this movie's ending is, to put it politely, remarkable. Most of this movie is like a train going full speed ahead, destination unknown. The audience is going for a ride and things are happening really fast and everything is hectic. Then the train suddenly arrives at its destination, and there's nothing, complete zero. That's the way this movie ends. Why this movie's creative team chose to do this is for them to explain, but most good movies have memorable endings that fit logically into the overall story, but here, in the climactic final moments of the movie, the part of the movie that's supposed to make the entire movie worth watching, the story takes a sudden detour that is so contrived, so utterly and obviously inconsistent with the rest of the story and so inexplicably predictable that it causes one to reasonably ask: why? This movie violates the first and second laws of movie-making: 1. Never make a good movie with a bad ending. 2. A bad movie may have a good ending, but a good movie never has a bad ending.<br/><br/>Now regarding the element of religion in the story, this is one of the movie's strong points. The story offers a strong and compelling portrayal of how religious teachings can be used to whip up hatred, fear and promote violence. Here religion is used as means of terrorizing people, sowing the seeds of discord and inflicting mental anguish. It's much easier now to understand how, for instance, during the Middle Ages, when seemingly inexplicable disasters occurred, like the plague that killed millions, people, suffering and groping for answers, could start looking around for someone to blame, using religion to justify the most horrendous acts. And this kind of stuff still goes on today.<br/><br/>This is one of the better sci-fi movies, no question about it. Except for the ending, which is weak, the movie presents a powerful story that raises questions. Is the mist and what it contains an act of God? An act of man? Or a combination of both? Is it an experiment? An accident? Or what? But most compelling and entertaining was not the special effects or the unique story, but the performance of Marcia Gay Harden. Ms. Harden is the star of this movie. Her powerful and dominating performance transforms this movie into a cinematic masterpiece, a word which is not used lightly here. I expected another idiotic Hollywood scare 'em movie. It's tempting to reveal details of the story, but suffice it to say that after you watch this movie you'll never take insects for granted and whenever you see the fog, you may wonder: what's it hiding?<br/><br/>Some other comments. Amazingly, unlike most Hollywood movies, especially of the sci-fi genre, this movie offers a story that actually has substance. What happens when people find themselves in extreme life-threatening situations that overtake them without any warning? This movie offers a stark portrayal of how religion can be used not as a source of comfort and support but as a tool of terror. When bad things happen to be people, is this divine retribution? Unbelievable as this may seem, this movie actually explores this subject, which for Hollywood movie is absolutely astounding. Were the deaths of millions of people let's say for instance in World War Two a man-made catastrophe or was it punishment inflicted on humanity by some higher power for past transgressions?"
"bc_viewer","1","3","8","12 March 2016"," Awful
","Awful film - who knows why this still has such a high rating on IMDb. Maybe some die-hard Stephen King fans wrote the positive reviews. I'm certainly not about to read a single Stephen King novel or novella based on this and I'm compelled to rate and review to stop someone else making the same mistake that I did in thinking that a rating of over 7 is generally worth a watch.<br/><br/>The basic premise is a bunch of people are holed up together while bizarre and dangerous creatures roam outside in the mist. The CGI is terrible (I know it was a few years back but surely there was some decent CGI around in 2007?!), the plot has no consistency - various different creatures are seen and it's hard to believe the one first seen just doesn't crop up at all later - the explanation for where this mist and the creatures have come from is terrible, barely elaborated on, with little imagination evident and the ending, for me, left a lot to be desired. Usually I love horror and I'm not adverse to sci-fi, and admittedly this had jumpy bits and gory bits; however, there were not enough believable scary moments (better CGI and special effects would have helped with this) and not enough character formation and decent dialogue to make it a decent drama. <br/><br/>There was scope for a potentially meaningful social comment on how humans change under stress and survive adversity but it is totally spoiled by the fact that it's dominated by a religious fanatic, so in my opinion all it serves to do is fuel stereotypical and negative attitudes towards religion. There's a terrible element of romance at one point, it's so predictable and between 2 characters who you haven't yet started to really care about, and then one of them dies almost immediately! <br/><br/>Having said all that, I did watch it 'til the end. I'm terribly curious."

Now for the ten line filler requirement..How they portrayed Christianity as insanity, then showed how instead of people coming together to try and preserve humanity, they just turned to abnormally ignorant. they showed how occurrences ""wouldn't"" happen. So lame, the creatures would have came regardless of any kind if so called mist. They relied more on blood guts and gore to attract the audience. Poor writing of escapees some make it, some don't? Really? The creatures were so dominant no one would have survived, which threw the movie off even more. Terrible choice of music, so the enormous creature trekked across the road, where did it come from, what contained it all this time."

"maxschrek5","Null","3","8","20 January 2011"," This is the worst movie ever!
","I hate this movie more than anything. It is just awful. It had the potential to be good but it kills that potential in the first 30 minutes. It alternates between boring and just stupid. The characters have no memorable traits, everything scary is also predictable, and it has the worst ending ever! Here's how it goes: everybody is trapped in the store and the crazy religious lady wants to sacrifice the little boy (a question, why is everybody following her? Wasn't she the laughing stock of the town at the start?). But our heroes escape (I don't remember any of their names, their was Thomas Jane who only had one expression, the little boy, and an old guy and a blonde chick). But then they realize that all their families are dead so Thomas Jane kills them all to save them from the monsters. That could have worked, but here's the kicker! The army shows up and it reveals the people who stayed at the store were saved. So, the evil people who were lemmings to the crazy lady and were for human sacrifice are saved but our hero has lost his family and friends just because he was one of the only people who wasn't bats**t crazy. THAT""S A GREAT MORAL! If you think for yourself and rebel against evil people, you will lose everything and your life will suck. So who is the hero then? The responsible people or the bats**t crazy lemmings led by the crazy religious lady?! Bottom line: THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE! And Frank Darabont, I have only seen two of your movie so far (Shawshank Redemption is overrated!) and nothing will raise my opinion of you after this travesty. YOU STINK!"
"Samiam3","3","3","8","12 September 2009"," Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish
","I'd like to put full blame on Frank Darabont for the rubbish I saw, but equal blame should go to Stephen King. This is the dumbest story I think he's ever created. Sci-fi is not his cup of tea. After I saw Dreamcatcher, I thought that was bad. The Mist makes it look award worthy. This film is to horror/sci-fi what the Stone Temple Pilots were to grunge music. The story pilfers from so many of its predecessors, including the Mummy, Dawn/Night of the living Dead, Aliens, you name it. Praise for this film is misleading. If it is fun you are looking for, stay away from the Mist.<br/><br/>Like all King stories, this one is set in a town in Maine. It begins in the living room of David Drayton a painter of movie artwork. It is a dark and stormy night, stormy enough to uproot a tree which crashes through the window. The next morning, after he and his wife inspect the damage and decide what to do, David goes grocery shopping at the local supermarket, taking his son with him. As it turns out, everybody at there is talking about the storm, and the damage it has done. But that is only a wrist slap compared to the disaster which is about to follow. All of a sudden, a strange mist engulfs the mall, and in runs a local with blood on his clothes. Shaken and panicking, he claims that there is something in the mist, and it has killed someone. The doors are shut and locked in a futile attempt to keep the unknown out. What follows is a boring series of creature attacks causing everyone to skriek, panic, argue, and point fingers at each other. David (eager to get his son to safety) must find a solution, before it is too late.<br/><br/>The whole movie is a gimmick: badly written, badly acted, unscary, and even incompetent with visual effects. Actually, the biggest problem I have with the Mist can be summarized in one word...subversive. The Mist has anti-religious/government themes which are perfectly fine, but the film takes it too far over the top, which interferes with good story telling. Representing religion is Marcia-Gay Harden, whose performance is the worst of the year. Thomas Jane in the lead role isn't so good either. Jane is the wrong actor for an emotional character like a struggling father. He works better as your basic all American hero, which he was in Deep Blue Sea.<br/><br/>It is kind of hard to figure out why people praise this movie. What I saw was disappointing and is not something I recommend to fans."
"TTho","2","3","8","26 October 2008"," Horrible ending, ridiculous continuity
","The nonsequiters, plot holes and poor continuity drove me crazy. Critter cracks a window. Two seconds later the actors look at the same critter through the crack-free window. The storefront gets blown out, but they panic over keeping the front door closed! They'd be neck-deep in monsters for the rest of the movie, which would make it blessedly shorter. Since rope-guy made it 20 feet out front before becoming a bite-sized snack, Drayton decides he can make it to his car, which is closer. But what about the tentacles that snatched bag boy right off the loading dock? They're safer out front than in back? Drayton begs people not to go outside, then he does it TWICE. The religious evangelista's gross put-downs to the substitute mom are completely out of character. The previously unseen couple shares a romantic moment, which makes clear that they are both about to be toast. Then after all that we get the uplifting ending which is, again, completely out of character. I could see that happening if they had monsters all around, but they're just sitting there. I assume they're being apologists for what allegedly happened in the hospitals after Hurricane Katrina? I'd be shocked if the director has kids, and if he does, I feel sorry for them.<br/><br/>I give it a 2 instead of a 1 because it did create tension, Toby Jones created a totally original character and Thomas Jane was a good leading man. Marcia Gay Harden was way over the top, though. The monsters were okay; I've seen crab-monster before but can't place him. Will have to check the credits (not).<br/><br/>This movie would have been a lot better with a team of sarcastic robots taking jabs at it. If MST3K comes back, this movie should be its first victim."
"nothinbutchris","2","3","8","23 July 2008"," This was just awful...
","I'll get to the point, shall I? This was, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. When I looked on IMDb after watching ""The Mist"" I was utterly speechless when I saw that it received a very high rating. The story-line was terrible, the mist appeared without any real explanation and disappeared just as erratically. The ""monsters"" were just plain ridiculous looking, and most of the dialogue was farcical. The reasons for me giving such a generous rating as two stars are that there was some very good acting from some of the cast, particularly from Nathan Gamble and Marcia Gay Harden. Also, there were some highly entertaining scenes, most of which included the religious fanatic played by Marcia Gay Harden. But, as a whole, this was a monstrosity, and a debacle of modern day cinema."
"luke-346","9","3","8","5 July 2008"," A very courageous horror film. Well done!!
","As any film fan will know, if Frank Darabont adapts a Stephen King novel and directs it then you should really sit up and take note. For those that are unaware, Darabont wrote and directed the Stephen King adaptations The Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile and now he brings to us The Mist, which is ironically a return to roots for Frank Darabont who started out writing on 80s horror B Movies. The Mist is a film about a group of townsfolk whose town becomes engulfed by a terrifying cloud that traps them inside a glass-fronted convenience store. The cloud contains strange creatures and various monsters that could quite easily kill the humans, should the mist make its way into the building.<br/><br/>As the characters converse inside the building they are forced to get along as best they can, shades of Lord of the Flies springs to mind and, characterized by their behavior, they begin to take sides and split into factions. Superbly written and wonderfully acted, all the characters portray a sense of realism that is rarely captured when trying to represent such hostile environments. Furthermore, being that we live in an age when reality TV and manufactured environments are created to imprison volunteers for the amusement of others, a film like The Mist has more bearing on our conscious than perhaps the makers envisaged. This connotation with contemporary sources of entertainment provides the audience with the ability to register and humanize with the townsfolk much more easily allowing for their dilemmas and disagreements to have an increased impact, which in turn intensifies the horrific nature of their circumstances.<br/><br/>The best performance of the film is by Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Mrs. Carmody, a religious nut that achieves a leadership through her constant preaching. The manner in which she plays Mrs. Carmody leads me to believe that she is a much underrated actress as during this film I truly despised her. The anti-religious notions that are ever present throughout the film are tainted with malevolent undertones and fanatical ideologies that brilliantly portray a level of fear rarely touched upon in contemporary horror. The Mist tells of religion as being fundamental to some peoples grasp of hope and that with it even the most apparently sane individuals will result in ""lynching"" others to achieve savior. It is an austere representation of religion that serves as a reminder to us all of its capabilities. The fact that the religion being pilloried in The Mist is Christianity has been dwelled upon too much by some critics, this choice of religion is merely fitting given the films location and setting, any other choice would have been inappropriate.<br/><br/>The Mist is a fine cult horror, so much so that it does not deserve to be viewed in a cinema. It is a film that would play out much better watched at home on your own TV. It is an intellectual film that will no doubt cause debate to ensue following the final reels. Ultimately, and as with previous Darabont ventures, the film is about hope. Its narrative is strongly embedded in the characters belief that there may be way out of their predicament and that their fate is not yet sealed. This is beautifully illustrated at one point in the film when one of the groups, which have emerged from the townsfolk, must make the decision of either staying with the brainwashed, or venturing into the outside mist; it is a choice of facing one of two fears  fellow humans or the unknown. Their fate sealed if they stay, but perhaps not if they leave.<br/><br/>The film is pessimistic in its outlook and serves as wonderful reminder of the importance of hope to us all. The ending has gained a lot of criticism, but I believe it to be by far one of the best endings to a film I have seen in a long time. After it had finished the despair and anguish I felt was in direct correlation with the characters and the story, thus the film had achieved its goal. I whole heartedly admire a director that has the courage to go against a studios wishes and audience expectations and provide an ending that is a bleak and daunting as the 120 minutes that have preceded it. Frank Darabont has stuck with the continuity of the narrative themes and left us with perhaps the starkest metaphor for hope ever to grace contemporary cinema.<br/><br/>Finally, The Mist is a contemporary B Movie, which is no surprise given Darabonts history in the area but also it is a wonderful social commentary that so happens to take its shape in a horror film, that also happens to be a Stephen King adaption. After seeing The Mist, Darabont has gone up a notch in my estimations as a director and writer. I thoroughly recommend The Mist to anyone that likes to leave a film feeling depressed, but immensely satisfied."
"frezeframe","2","3","8","20 April 2008"," I think this is a fair review:
","-This is for those who have seen the film and didn't think it was the ""Best movie ever"" First of all, let me say that the director Frank Darabont is a terrific director and has made two of my top 100 all time favorite films... The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.<br/><br/>However, this was like watching Ken Griffy Jr. step up to the plate, swing and miss. I was extremely disappointed. I was told that this was scary and that the ending was one of the best endings EVER. I don't take that too lightly, especially when it's written on the cover of the DVD. I know it was a horror film, I know it wasn't supposed to be taken too literally, but come on... people don't behave the way they behaved in The Mist. Here are a few things that made me write this comment- 1. There's no way they would have let Marcia Gay Harden (who was one of the few good actors) have that kind of power over them. Whether she was a profit or not. And if she did have that power... surely she would have gotten the gun, or been aware that someone might try to shoot her if she held up our ""protagonists"" at knifepoint with her new posse (consisting of the town folk who had no business being in a posse) 2. The dialogue was tough to sit through. It just seemed forced and unrealistic.<br/><br/>3. The characters were rough as well. With the exception of the two leads... they were mediocre actors who were following lines in a script. There was no depth to the characters and hardly any subtext. The subtext that was provided was pointless.. because the ending showed us that the whole movie was kind of pointless.<br/><br/>4. The army guys. Hated them. Their characters sucked. Sorry Frank, but they sucked. What they just decide to hang themselves in the back room?? Are you kidding me? And for being military men, they sure were cowardly. And for being fresh out of boot camp... they sure knew an awful lot of information about this ""mist."" Were they military ingelligence? No they weren't. They were about to go on leave. They were fresh out of highschool kids.. and they knew the details of this secret military operation. And how do they deal with it? They hang themselves? Way to go. If the characters were smarter, or likable, or more significant, er.. believable... then maybe we would care when they die. The way it was, I found it hard to care about them because they seemed fake. The actors sucked too.<br/><br/>4. The ending. OK, fine. I know it sounds good on paper... kill everyone. But really? Why not wait till the monster is right in front of you, or until you have no other option... or why not have a confrontation with the monster? Or how bout just end the movie by saying the line ""there's 4 bullets left"".. and not show it? The audience invested in these characters, then bam.. everybody's dead except for our hero and the viewer is left feeling like crap... not to mention- feeling like our hero was a total pus#y. It was really depressing, and not worth sitting through the whole spectacle of this ridiculous plot, to not have anything come out of it. - I understand wanting to do something different. And it was. It just didn't resonate at all with me. Stephen King didn't even write the ending that way. He stopped it after our hero says there's four bullets left. He left it up to the imagination. Did they make it or not? I don't know, it just seemed too easy to me to kill everyone. It was a cop-out.<br/><br/>So, great director... just a sh#t#y movie. It happens. Steven Speilburg made AI, the Coen's made Intolerable Cruelty and Frank Darabont made The Mist. I hope he gets his groove back for Fahrenheit 451. That's all"
"freedvd2","1","3","8","27 March 2008"," A climax in the wrong way ...
","It was suspenseful .. horror .. entertaining on the edge of the seat. Not even a stephen king reader and hated the ending. The one group fights through the movie to overcome the ""Vessel of God"" (image to point at religious fanatics) just to drive off past King's ending so the father could shoot the 2 old people .. the woman who comforted his son .. and shot his son. All to survive 30 secs for the military to come. At that point I don't care what the director was trying to say. That went from good scifi horror flick to desensitized violence we've come to numb ourselves in life and on the screen.<br/><br/>If this was signed off by Mr. King, I've lost some respect for the man that I even hardly know about. Pretty sad to praise a movie that makes a father shoot his son!!!"
"woodyns","8","3","8","11 March 2008"," The first human that should be cloned is Frank Darabont
","Rarely I give a rating of 8 for an excellent movie takes a 7. The mist is above excellent and I give it 8/10. If you are looking for human eating creatures with hyped effects and lots of blood and people killed left and right, don't waste your time getting into the mist. The mist is grade A movie, characters are strong and suspense is built in a way that makes you live each one of the characters.<br/><br/>It is a great way to expose human nature and how people look for anyone or anything that gives salvation or even hope. How people can do bad things when put in extreme situations. When you think you are doing the right thing, it might turn out to be the wrong thing to do.<br/><br/>Besides the message that was passed to the audience quite well, effects are good and not exaggerated, and the creatures are awesome! Everybody or at least 90% of people know what is coca cola, if you don't watch the mist you won't know what a good horror/suspense movie is."
"moviegeek310","8","3","8","28 December 2007"," Extremely Disturbing yet Well Made
","Before reading this review and if you're even considering seeing this movie I'm going to say this straight away; if you get queasy or are easily scarred during movies, read no further, this movie is not for you. But if you're still thinking it looks interesting, I'll tell you the plot, and then maybe you'll reconsider.<br/><br/>This film is based on a novella by horror mastermind Stephen King, and follows a group of people who get stuck in a supermarket after a large mist covers the entire town. At first they think it's just a harmless bit of fog but they soon find out they're dead wrong. In the mist lives creatures, horrible monsters from another dimension who one by one take someone every night and kill them. But one guy played with gritty realism by newcomer Thomas Jane is determined to get out and when he does he stumbles upon unspeakable horrors. <br/><br/>Still find it appealing? I thought not. Director Frank Darabont who made King's other books ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" into masterpieces has created a grotesque, disturbing film about the things humans will resort to when confronted with fear. Kind of like ""Lord of the Flies"" complete with a sacrifice, which is definitely the most disturbing part in the film. And I'm not saying that this movie is badly done, no, this movie is extremely well made, and a truly horrific movie but its not because of the giant mutant bugs, but because of the characters.<br/><br/>In this movie is a character that, without a doubt, will become the most hated villain of the year; it's a religious lady played by Marcia Gay Harden. Though it bothered me that the villain was religious she isn't religious in a Christian sense, she's a demonic extremist who believes the only way to appease the creatures is to kill the non-believers and offer them as a sacrifice. It is truly sick and twisted. <br/><br/>So I don't recommend this film to anyone unless you're a gore-loving fanatic. And it doesn't even end happy, the end sequence is shocking and depressing and will make you leave the theater feeling in the dumps and like you've been pounded repeatedly with a sledge hammer. <br/><br/>For entertainment value I give it 2 out of 10. But for being well made, engrossing, and truly scary I give it 8 out of 10."
"adamdonaghey","4","3","8","29 November 2007"," Yet Another Misguided Stephen King Adaptation...
","There's always certain characteristics in a Stephen King adaptation that never seem to change. For one thing, you can always count on a decent story and on top of that, you typically develop some emotional concern for the protagonists along the way. The Mist doesn't veer from those characteristics. And, while I haven't actually read Stephen King's novella, I'm sure I would enjoy it after seeing the film adaptation. As a whole, however, I really didn't like the film at all. I really thought the screenplay was amateur and hokey, when it clearly wasn't trying to be. The film really wanted to be intelligent and even eminent, I think. I mean, the underlying morals and lessons are all too important and certainly a bit urgent, given the world we live in currently. But with the dialogue so badly written, I really can't give it the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was the acting, but after some deliberation, I've come to terms with the fact that it's completely the fault of the writers. The circumstances and logical conclusion the characters come to in certain key instances really seem flawed and misguided. There's nothing more irritating than watching characters in films who are clearly supposed to be logical and reasonable, make illogical and unreasonable decisions, even though the film seems to think they made the right decisions. I'm not sure if any of that really makes any sense, but the bottom line is there's a fine line between creating a character who makes mistakes and a character who makes mistakes but those mistakes are totally ignored by all other characters, circumstances in the film and the film itself.<br/><br/>And for those of you who have seen it--or if you haven't, take a second look at this after you have--I suppose you think I'm mostly talking about the ending. But I'm not because the ending works. It doesn't matter what I would do or you would do, or what the right thing to do is done. That's not what's important. What's important is whether what was actually done is believable, or not. In this case, the ending was believable. I believed all the characters involved in the final climatic scene were truly to that point. Would I have made that decision? Probably not. But the fact that they did didn't brush me the wrong way whatsoever. It was a shock and I was certainly surprised, but it worked really well and I think without that final scene, the film would have been a complete flop. So, I suppose it goes without saying, if the mistakes and/or illogical or unreasonable decisions are ignored, the film simply doesn't work (and there are a lot of points in the film that I feel didn't work for this very reason); but on the other hand, if the mistakes are acknowledged, then the film generally works because of it. By and large, this film just didn't work for me."

But two things bothered me: one was the constant push of the religious woman. nothing against religion, but the way it took over the movie, it seemed to ruin it for me, turning it into one of those koolaid-cult type movies. the second point that bothered me, which isn't as big as the first, was that you never got to see the big creatures as clearly as the small ones. but thats just my opinion lol. i like to see the full extent of their imaginations within the movie. like that monster in the mist that kind of looked like a mantis, but you could only see it like a shadow. i would have loved to at least have seen it once fully."

","THE MIST THE MIST: Dimension/Mgm/Ua 2007 color 122 mins. Horror-Thriller Thomas Jane, Jeanne Tripplehorn, William Sadler, Laurie Holden, Alexa Davalos, Sam Whitwer and Nathan Gamble star. Written By Stephen King Directed by Frank Darabont Rated R for strong language, violence and gore.<br/><br/>What to say about The Mist hmmmm... Well I hated 1408 the last King adaptation and I liked Shawshank but didn't think much of the Green Mile both directed by Darabont. I'm definitely a Thomas Jane fan I had a huge crush on him in Deep Blue Sea and Laurie Holden of Silent Hill and Alexa Davalos of Chronicles of Riddick kick major ass. But that first trailer was so lackluster it looked like a bad TV movie and than came the second one and it was more enticing. The fantastic reviews starting popping up calling it one of the best films of the year and such so I started to get a bit more excited. But had to remember that 1408 got good reviews as well and I hated that. So I went into The Mist with decent expectations hoping it wouldn't be like The Fog remake. It wasn't. The Mist is one of the most hardcore, intense horror films I've ever seen it's also the best film of the year and one of the best films I've ever seen. The Plot setup is simple and can be seen in the trailer. A storm comes and people race to the local foodmart to pick up supplies just in case there is another. They become surrounded in the mist and must fend off creatures that live within it. Creatures that range from giant mosquitos to giant acid spewing spiders and leech like tentacles amongst others. This is a monster movie people. The most realistic monster movie ever made. And it will make you shake. it's scary, disturbing, emotional and thought provoking. I'm not sure what to make of the film's finale. I have only to say that it affected me on a deeply profound level rising the film above sheer entertainment value and making it a piece of art. The acting is fantastic especially from Thomas Jane whom gives a surprisingly emotional performance, the minor characters are also quite involving and do more than hold there own. With special kudos given to Tripplehorn as the person you will most hate in any movie ever. Gamble as Jane's son and Laurie Holden who does an awesome job as a new addition to the town. The film is layered with twists and subtexts. The cinematography is richly direct, realistic and dreamlike at the same time and the direction is artistic and comendable and the screenplay is powerful. Only the spfx seems lightly flawed but are easily forgiven by the film's incredible execution. The Mist has many things to say and I couldn't quite take all of them in but it's the type of film that you have to keep seeing and discussing because it's not one to be dismissed lightly surprising for a monster movie, huh. The best film of the year, The Mist is brilliant.<br/><br/>*****/5"

","I confess that I am not the biggest fan of Stephen King, but I have read a number of his books, which for the most part I find entertaining and fun, but usually not all that thought provoking.<br/><br/>Most of the time, that is. I was, however, quite impressed with the film adaptations of Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption, and I did not realize that the same director, Frank Darabont was responsible for this film as well. Apparently Mr. Darabont and Mr. King bring out the best in one another. This film is advertised as a horror film, and it does work very well as a horror film, on a level similar to The Birds or The Thing (there is a poster from the latter film in the first scene of Mist that serves as a kind of homage, if you are familiar with the John Carpenter poster from the remake, and I'm certain we were meant to notice it). Having had a couple of hours to digest The Mist, I have to say I was much more impressed with the film as a kind of allegory, or statement about humanity. It serves as an excellent example of how we treat each other, secretly or even openly respond to opinions of others, and the animosities that we often hide from each other just below the surface.<br/><br/>Just as in the films The Birds and The Thing, a cross-section of people with various backgrounds, in this case, blacks, whites, teachers, artists, religious fanatics, working class Joes, etc, are trapped together, isolated from the rest of the world. They need to trust each other and work with each other to survive. Because of their lack of trust and unwillingness to work together, however, this may prove impossible. I think it is an excellent statement about the times in which we live and I believe as time goes on, this film will be seen as a classic. Check it out, by all means and see what you think. If you have an open mind, it should give you a great deal to think about."

","""The Mist"" has always been one of my favorite King stories, I'm not much for short-story reading but this one was really above the cut. When I heard the director of ""Shawshank"" and ""The Green Mile"" was behind this adaptation I was genuinely excited to see it, and after nearly two hours of an excellent horror film, the director twist the tale and spoils the effect.<br/><br/>The issue I'm commenting on is the end of the story as told by King who gives a grim, but hopeful final few paragraphs letting reader know that hope is alive and well.<br/><br/>Director Frank Dermont destroys hope.<br/><br/>The last minutes of this film screw up horribly. First, our main character kills his little boy just as the child opens his eyes and see's what daddy's about to do. Then, out of bullets and unable to kill himself the man awaits death at the hands of the mist monsters. But know, the military comes and the man is saved, just after murdering his own child. What's worse, we get a shot of a small religious cult formed in the grocery store where 90% of the film takes place being rescued, driving by, smirking, as if to say, see, if you put your faith in God, all would be well.<br/><br/>The film becomes an allegory for Christian faith, suddenly it's not ""Kings: The Mist"" but Kings Left Behind.<br/><br/>The director murdered, twisted and ruined the end. One of my favorite King stories, ruined on screen."
"watchthe-shootingstar","1","4","13","28 December 2007"," This movie, plain and simple sucked.
","It was irritating, from the beginning to the end. cliché after cliché, and what's worse, is that everyone one of these clichés (country town in the middle of nowhere, army base, ""Aww shucks"" white people, stupid swearing teen, crazy religious lady etc) are drawn out and made the main themes of the movie, especially the crazy religious lady who preaches, LITERALLY- not the first scene, not the second scene, but in ALL but two scene in this movie. They were not even humorous clichés, as the characters took their stupidity so seriously to the point where it was irritating. The acting is very predictable and stale. It has a few gory scenes here and there, but not even close to being frightening only laughably ridiculous. I squirmed in my seat not from fear but from pure boredom and annoyance at the films repetitiveness, predictability, sappy dialogue, and drawn out, boring, ""put-me-to-sleep"" plot and characters. Speaking of characters, most annoyingly was the supposedly heroic leading man's helplessness against a crazy old lady who somehow managed to brainwash everyone in the store, (except for the ""good guys"") in less than 48 hours. To top it all off, the music was HORRIBLE. Deep, depressing organ tones, with an Enya like choir moaning in the background carried on for about 10 minutes at a time. I literally had to plug my ears and grit my teeth at the theater to avoid simply walking out, because despite all this, I DID want to know how it all ended. But alas, not even the ending is satisfying as none of the questions are answered and you don't witness how, or even IF, the giant monsters are destroyed, it simply ""just ends,"" almost as abruptly as the Sopranos.<br/><br/>It's not scary. It's boring. It's sad and surprising that it's a Stephen King film. And ultimately it's a waste of time and money."
"brenttraft","4","4","13","2 December 2007"," Stay Out of ""The Mist""
","""The Mist"" is not an especially bad film, but it offers nothing that hasn't been done many times before and is nothing special.<br/><br/>This is a run of the mill, ""B"" horror film. The monsters are good but the characters are bad. The director does not seem to be able to make up his mind whether he wants to make this campy or if he wants to play it straight up. While there are a couple of funny parts, this is mostly not scary and none of the characters are likable. Thomas Jane is not really a movie star and he cannot carry the film.<br/><br/>If you liked ""The Host"" and ""Slithers,"" you might like this film more than I did. Otherwise, avoid ""The Mist."""
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","4","13","27 November 2007"," I loved The Mist, the ending still has me screaming!
","I saw the trailer for The Mist a while back, I thought it was just going to be a rip off of John Carpenter's The Fog, but after hearing some great reviews on IMDb, I got excited and my boyfriend and I decided to see it tonite. The beginning was starting off pretty slow, so I was thinking that this was going to be an average thriller, but about twenty minutes into the film, things really pick up. Things get scarier, more intense, The Mist had my digging my fingernails into my boyfriend's arm. I don't think we've had a better Sci-Fi film in a long time. I was thinking about how much this movie kind of reminded me of ""Night of the Living Dead"", where everyone gets so scared and tense that they quickly turn on each other. It had a very similar ending, it just had me screaming. I can't give the ending away, but believe me, this is a movie not to be missed.<br/><br/>In a small town, David, his son, and his wife have just been through a horrible storm. David and his son the next day decide to go to the grocery store, where everyone is a buzz of the horrifying storm. But something even worse happens, a man comes screaming across the street, begging them to close the doors, he has blood on his face, he's screaming how his friend was just killed by a mysterious mist. The mist has now surrounded the grocery store. After trying to figure out a way to save the food, a bag boy is killed by a vicious creature in the mist, the group now knows how serious this is. But things are getting worse with the local religious nut, Mrs. Carmody, she's turning this situation from horrifying to savage and turning everyone against another. But David along with a group full of people know that it's now or never.<br/><br/>The Mist is one of the most horrific movies I have ever seen. It had me jumping every second and shaking, the great thing was that it wasn't a movie that had things or loud noise jump out at you, it was so natural, the whole setting and story just gets under your skin. A big round of applause towards the actress who played Mrs. Carmody, I couldn't believe how much I just wanted to jump into the screen and just kill her, but she was that convincing, she gets to you. Everyone did a fantastic job in this film, it's truly horrifying and will get to you. The scene where they find out about the marine knowing something about the monsters outside was one of the most intense scenes that I have seen this year in film. I promise you, this movie is going to be in the Sci-Fi classics for generations to come.<br/><br/>9/10"
"MetalBoi","10","4","13","24 November 2007"," Not since Aliens has such a Movie Perfectly Bottled Fear in its Purest Essence
","Wow. Holy f-ing s---. I can't remember a movie that got me saying that phrase aloud so many times in a theater full of people. And there was a little girl sitting next to me too, but I guess if her dad thinks its cool for her to see a movie like The Mist, I don't think he's one to complain about my language... Anyways onto the review of The Mist. This is not a normal B movie monster flick, but with Frank Darabont directing I would think not anyways. I haven't read Stephen King's novella this film is based on but this is one hell of a roller-coaster ride. What makes it so good is that the film makes you care for the poor people that are stuck in the mess of being surrounded by mist full of monsters ready to devour them at any moment.<br/><br/>The human reaction to their surroundings and infighting that results from their situation is what makes this film stand out above the rest of your every day horror films. Plus the protagonists groups excursions into the pharmacy next door was very reminiscent of the classic scene in Aliens when the Space Marines sweep the Alien hive in the main processing station has a scene captured that oh sh-- effect of knowing something terrible is going to happen and then WHAM! it does. Actually the scene was a little too familiar if you catch my drift(POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Cocoons, live body being exploded from organisms from within, acid webs? LOL) But if your gonna rip a scene off might as well rip it from a classic.<br/><br/>In conclusion SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
"revsolly","1","4","13","24 November 2007"," Not the worst...but
","I was looking forward to a Sci-fi movie that would be thrilling and, maybe, a cut above. To some extent, that is what I got.<br/><br/>However, there was a lot more in this film that I wasn't expecting, and had no need for.<br/><br/>While the special effects were good and the feeling of terror genuine, this film also took the time to launch into an anti-Christian tirade (what Hollywood movie doesn't do that, these days?). I forgot that this is one of Stephen Kings favorite subplots.<br/><br/>Firstly, the proliferation of foul language was unnecessary and detracted from the movie. Surely, there are more than just a few people who are able to operate in a crisis situation without spouting curses with practically every other word.<br/><br/>As an acting role, Marcia Harden did a splendid job of showing a quirky person who, in the face of unbearable pressure, quickly descends into madness. However, Stephen King saw fit to intertwine her descent into madness with Christianity, thereby embracing another false stereotype that Hollywood loves to indulge itself in. Mrs. Carmody was shown to, in one moment, spew the Old Testament and Revelation with equal spittle while, in the very next moment, spewing invectives and obscenities. The shallow characterization got so bad that, when she was shot by one of the store employees, several people in the theater cheered and clapped.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending was, at best, convoluted. Yes, I can understand that these people did not want to die in the same manner that they had seen others die. However, at the time of their ""agreed upon"" suicide/murder, they were not under any kind of attack. As a matter of fact, we learn just scant minutes later, that this is because the Army is moving in and driving the beasties back. Are you telling me that the people couldn't at least wait and see if they were going to be attacked? They had to die right then!?!? This could have been a better than average movie. I guess there is some consolation in the fact better it was better than The Langoliers. And now, it has Skyline to keep it from hitting bottom."
"sweatpants15","1","3","9","1 July 2017"," Awful
","Let me start by saying that when it comes to movies, I am very easy to please. I'm perfectly happy with a semi-plausible story and one- dimensional characters, as long as it entertains. (Case in point: I genuinely enjoyed the movie ""Doom""). I don't ask much from movies, just this: Don't treat me like I'm stupid.<br/><br/>Which brings me to ""The Mist"": I absolutely hated this movie. I didn't mind the plot at all -- in fact it seemed quite promising, and I enjoyed the movie for the first 45 minutes or so. But eventually the mind-numbing stupidity of the characters dragged this movie down to the point of farce, with each successive turn to gore seeming like a more and more desperate attempt just to keep the audience interested.<br/><br/>Everyone is well aware of the cliché behaviorisms of horror movie characters, but that's nothing compared to the ridiculous decisions and reactions showcased throughout this movie. By the end, I was flat- out heckling the main characters:<br/><br/>""Hey guys! This sure is a horrifyingly dangerous situation. We should probably wait around for another minute or two before trying to escape it!""<br/><br/>""Say, I foresee that this small annoyance might actually turn into an existential threat in a day or two."" ""I agree. Let's try to ignore it for as long as possible.""<br/><br/>Fittingly, the movie's iconic glass storefront provides the perfect example of this inexplicable behavior. After recognizing it as their one major point of vulnerability, the characters proceed to essentially build a sandbag wall along the bottom half of the glass, and... that's it. The top half is left completely untouched, without so much as a couple strips of duct tape to keep it from shattering - - as if all those terrifying monsters would be unable to negotiate a three-foot stack of dog food.<br/><br/>It's hard to convey the full essence of this inexplicable behavior without providing significant spoilers, but after watching the movie for yourself you should be able to pick up these threads over the entire movie. I don't recommend doing so of course -- I'm angry enough that I can't get this two hours of my life back."

","Having recently watched 1408, I was pleased with King story lines and looked forward to another truly scary movie. Unfortunately, to the average viewer, this film won't hold up to the test. Sure, there are decent moments, and the insect like monsters from ""another dimension"" are scary looking, but there aren't very many suspenseful moments, and the pathetic attempts at social commentary make one wonder what the point of the movie really is. I probably could have enjoyed the points King was trying to make about a crisis bringing out the worst in people if things weren't so annoyingly portrayed. The movie succeeds at the point, it gets a reaction from the viewer (in the case of the people I watched it with, frustration), but the mediocre acting and poor special effects do nothing to help enhance what is otherwise a lackluster and preachy ""horror"" movie."

","Sometimes it happens - some director who used to be good creates something awful so you even can not believe it. How come? How, HOW did he do THIS? Why? May be he was sick and somebody was directing instead of him? May be he was forced to direct this?<br/><br/>Everything was awful: script, acting (from the most of the actors except Jane) but bad acting was a result of the bad directing not because they all are bad actors. The idea was not so bad but everything was done so badly... Overly long, boring, almost absolute absence of logic how people behave themselves, how they suppose to behave, react in these particular situations, often overly dramatic and so on and on... The worst CG and FX I've seen in a long-long time...<br/><br/>Such a big disappointing..."
"em89072002","3","3","9","26 November 2007"," Don't expect a creepy/scary horror flick
","The best thing about this movie are the previews and trailers that advertise it. It's an interesting premise with tremendous possibilities, but unfortunately the movie doesn't hold up to these enticements.<br/><br/>Don't expect a creepy/scary horror flick. The movie is based on a story from Stephen King, and it has more of a surreal/supernatural vibe like many of his other stories turned movie: ""Dreamcatcher"", ""Storm Of The Century"", ""The Langoliers"". These last two movies have similar story setups like ""The Mist"" where a group of random people find themselves pitted against some supernatural entity. However, in the ""Storm"" and ""Langoliers"" the people work together more or less and try to understand what they're up against in order to survive. In ""The Mist"" the curiosity factor is missing and the larger group splits into smaller factions: macho dolts, religious zealots, and the ersatz family unit plucked from the aisles of the grocery store.<br/><br/>The movie is predictable not only because outcomes are clearly setup on a linear path ahead of time, but also because the characters repeatedly tell you what is going to happen and then it happens just like they said. For example, a man is told not to go outside because it's dangerous and he will get killed, but he goes outside where it's dangerous and he gets killed, several people say that if something isn't done about the religious fanatic she will turn the crowd against them, but they don't do anything and she turns the crowd against them, and this connect-the-dots method of story telling goes on and on throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie pulls out all the stops and goes way over the top. It becomes very preachy like religion leads to fanaticism and the military is evil (whether there's any truth to these notions is irrelevant, it's the dumbed-down manner in which these ideas are presented that makes the movie so annoying). The characters act very stupidly too. When a group of people come under attack in the pharmacy, they continue to stand around waiting to be picked off instead of immediately running away which would seem much more realistic. Another disturbing aspect of this film is that it lacks a discernible time line; whether it's been a matter of minutes, hours or days between events is unclear. Some measure of time would have been useful in understanding the characters actions. If the characters completely give up hope after only an hour they're idiots, but if they give up after days with no hope in sight then their actions might be more understandable. <br/><br/>This movie saves the worst kitsch for last. Think family unit out for a Sunday drive with grandmother and grandfather in the back seat, mother in front passenger seat gently caressing a young sleeping child in her lap, and dad diligently driving. Suddenly they run out of gas. So, dad pulls out a gun, loads four bullets, and aptly blows his passengers away without the slightest objection from any of them. So much for their desire to survive. Then dad steps out of the car and is rescued by none other than the military.<br/><br/>Quite a disappointment."

","Greetings again from the darkness. With the greatness of ""Shawshank Redemption"" on his resume, writer/director Frank Darabont's name will forever be associated with film greatness. Hooking up again with a Stephen King (""The Green Mile"") story, Darabont takes aim at the monster/creature/sci-fi films of the 50's and 60's (think ""The Blob"" not ""The Fog""). While this one has significant human nature editorializing, the actual frights are few and far between because mostly what we see are some stupid looking bugs that can be killed with a mop handle.<br/><br/>The hero is Thomas Jane (""The Punisher"") and a couple of his nemesis are played here by Andre Braugher (""Homicide"") and a scene-chewing Marcia Gay Harden as the religious fanatic, who seizes her moment on the mountain top. Also joining in the food store fun is Laurie Holden, who spends most of the film taking care of Jane's wimpy son, William Sadler as a total buffoon, and Alexa Davalos (very good in ""Feast of Love"") who demonstrates what the bugs are capable of.<br/><br/>The two best performances are from Toby Jones (""Infamous"") as the sharp tongued, sharp-shooting grocery clerk and the great Frances Sternhagen, whose character could make a fine little film unto herself. Of course, this film is not about the acting ... it is about the frightening monsters in the mist. Exploring the fear of the unknown, the effects of trauma and stress and expediency at which the religious fanatics seize on weakness. And yes, this is 2007, so there is a story line that bashes the military. I believe a similar type story line exists in 83% of films released this year.<br/><br/>While not the best work from King or Darabont, it is a satisfactory monster movie that pretends to look deeper, but is actually pretty shallow."
"secretagent_007","10","3","9","23 November 2007"," The Mist never misses
","The streak of awesome Frank Darabont/Stephen King collaborations continues with The Mist, based on King's novella of the same name, and happily unrelated to The Fog. The story also inspired the video game Half-Life, which is a personal favorite. Having spawned a great movie and a great game, maybe I ought to read this story someday It starts off simply, with a terrible storm one night that knocks over trees, takes out the power, and sends most of the local populace into town for supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane) brings his son to the grocery store and notices a large cloud of mist over the lake. Not long after arriving at the store, the same cloud of mist overtakes the entire area and with it comes fear, paranoia, and really creepy noises. After some reports of people being taken or killed by things in the mist, and after some amount of discussion, everyone decides they have to stay inside the grocery store. Even without the mysterious presence in the mist, I'd feel rather trapped in that store since you can't see more than five feet in front of you. In fact, I have to give the filmmakers special acknowledgment for making the best mist/fog/all-encompassing smoke I've ever seen in a movie. Silent Hill had some good-looking ash, but it was merely visual. The mist in this movie takes on a soupy quality where it simply appears hard to move through. And the sound design, implying all manner of creepy beasts out there, takes it to a new level.<br/><br/>It quickly becomes clear that the noises in the mist belong to real creatures, not the peoples' collective imagination. Flying, crawling, tip-tapping, slithering things that seem projected directly out of H.P. Lovecraft's brain, only better. All of the monsters have disturbingly human features too, which is just amazing. A foot-long flying slug with a nasty stinger is scary enough, I'd say, but you give that thing a face that looks like a skull but with more teeth and you're approaching brilliance. Hear me now, readers. The monsters are great. The monsters. Are great.<br/><br/>But there are other monsters too. These also look human, but that's only because they are. As more creatures show up and more people die, more of the survivors go a little bit nuts. They're afraid and want answers and a solution to their predicament, which is understandable. They find their answers in a local ""unstable"" woman named Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) - a Bible-toting doom-sayer. As the days inside the grocery store go by, she convinces more and more people that this is the End of Days and the demons outside are God's punishment. The situation grows more desperate by the minute and people start taking sides. And before you know it, the side that wants to sacrifice people to the monsters outside has got numbers on its side.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is a good leading man, as usual, but the stand out performance belongs to Toby Jones, who played Truman Capote in that other movie about Capote a couple years ago. His transformation from meek cashier to sharpshooting bad ass is a pivotal counterpoint to Mrs. Carmody's own transformation of the people in the store. It's a picture of brains vs. mysticism. Hard work, courage, and persistence vs. fear, hatred, and the blindest faith I've ever seen. Social commentary gets a thumbs up from me, but there are one or two scenes that push it too far before Mrs. Carmody's inevitable rise to power. Just pieces of dialogue and bits of action from the players that don't seem to fit the picture. In real life, I believe Mrs. Carmody would have been bound, gagged, tarred, feathered, and made to wear a dunce cap real soon after all the End of Days nonsense. But that's not the point. It's not supposed to be about what people would do if they were trapped in a store by monsters, it's about what people (in general and in groups) do when bombarded by fear. Do they overcome it or do they sink below it? Replace the constant, unebbing mist with the constant, unebbing threat of terrorism and you can start to understand how this movie relates to the real world. Do we confront the fear ourselves or do we place our faith in someone or something else to rescue us? Let it be said that there are things - sounds, images, emotions - in this film that I never thought I'd experience in a theater. It is supremely bizarre without ever losing focus of its human story or of its connection to our world. There is a little too much social analyzing going on, creating large gaps between the really impressive creature sequences, and also a problem or two with its ending. Mainly that I saw it coming about ten minutes before it actually did. Still, despite any flaws within, I can't recommend you see this movie enough.<br/><br/>http://www.movieswithmark.com"
"headfulofghosts126","6","3","9","21 November 2007"," A faithful adaptation, but only pretty good
","I love the novella this film was based on. It's one of my favorite Stephen King stories. And I was incredibly excited that Darabont was finally able to bring it to the screen. I knew that no matter how great it was I probably wouldn't be able to get into it as much as the original story simply because what your imagination cooks up is always scarier than what a filmmaker can show you.<br/><br/>That being said, The Mist is successful in a lot of ways. There is some genuine suspense, tension, and horror in the film. A lot of the sequences are extremely well crafted and executed. While the acting isn't consistently stellar, there are some standout performances and moments. It follows the story beat for beat until the very end (more on that later) and does a great job translating from page to screen.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the quality of the effects. The monsters looked pretty fake most of the time. The incredibly high level of tension that's built up is often released the second we get a good look at one. Most of them look like they were created for a video game.<br/><br/>The novella benefits from the interior monologue that the film obviously couldn't give us. And even though the time frame is accurate, the film moves a lot faster (naturally) which makes it feel less desperate and frightening.<br/><br/>I'd like to talk about the ending so be warned that massive spoilers lay ahead. Skip to the next review if you don't want to know...<br/><br/>...last chance...<br/><br/>Alright... here's the thing... David not being able to go back for his wife in the novella was a stronger narrative choice. Realizing she's probably dead but never getting that closure is heartbreaking. Turning that car around without knowing for sure is just devastating.<br/><br/>And then of course there's the addition of running out of gas and now what do we do. I liked that. I liked that a lot. And I totally buy the decision they make. Some people have said the moment doesn't play out long enough to be believable. I disagree. Think about everything they've already seen and what they've gone through. They know this is a hopeless situation. They can hear their impending doom right outside the windows. The thing is, I don't feel their needed to be time to wrestle with the decision because for them there was no decision. The choice was clear. They were at the end of the road. They went as far as they could and really, what was the other option? They had no way of knowing a solution was right behind them.<br/><br/>That's why I thought the film should have ended a few minutes before it did. After we hear the gunshots and see David in the car with the bodies.<br/><br/>Because when the army shows up it's just a slap in the face. A tacked on addition that robs the previous moment of its power and resonance just to try and be ironic. Instead of feeling like ""Well... there's no other way it could have ended"" it's like the filmmaker saying ""Haha! Look!"" So instead of leaving the theater unnerved and trying to wrap your brain around the fact that he had to kill his son, you leave thinking ""Oh why didn't he wait just a few more minutes???"" and to me that's just not as strong. It's cruel just to be cruel. It didn't feel genuine. It felt like a great big cinematic middle finger to the audience.<br/><br/>The controversy of the ending aside, the film ranks as pretty good and not great for me. I don't regret seeing it but I can't help but feel a little let down and that maybe there was a better movie in there somewhere."
"phizzle21","2","2","5","4 November 2019"," Did Frank Darabont's simple-minded twin brother hide in ""The Mist""?
","He probably dragged his more talented brother into the fog and took over his place in the director's chair. Otherwise, I would have to come to terms with the fact that the same person who made ""The Shawshank Redemption"" directed this train wreck.<br/><br/>What starts with a promising - although not very innovative - setting for a horror flick, soon shows to be a complete face palm of a movie (2 out of 10 stars).<br/><br/>All the ingredients for a decent horror movie are there in theory: remote town, confined location, diffuse outside threat of unknown origin, random group of neighbours and strangers locked in together. However, they just do not come together. In my opinion, the blame for this lies with the script and the direction, each credited with half of the work. The characters are all cardboard and either completely under-developed or way over the top. Their behaviour is just non-sensical and at times completely random. The CGI is insanely bad (even for a 2007 medium budgeted film). The monster-design is just laughable and uncreative (tentacles, bugs, spiders....yawn!). The acting (indlcuding the lead character) is probably the worst, I have seen all year. The dialog and direction are so heavy-handed, it feels like a school's play.<br/><br/>I read in some professional reviews that the movie was an ""important"" allegory on real-life, that the ending was ""daring"" and ""the most shocking in a decade"" etc. These critics just made me laugh in disbelief.<br/><br/>***Spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>A non-exhaustive, random list of all the stupidities:<br/><br/>1. At times, people are immediately torn to shreds, as soon as the fog surrounds them. When it is convenient to the story, however, large groups of people can venture out into the mist without being harassed for ages, even when they are screaming and making noises.<br/><br/>2. Why would the guys (in particular the litigator neighbour and his followers) not believe that it is dangerous to go outside, when there are obvious signs (such as the guy who came running, bleeding and in panic, who had just lost his friend, or later the severed tentacle). The people telling them, have clearly no sane reasons for not telling the truth.<br/><br/>3. Why would anyone want to try and go outside, after they have seen what happens if you do?? In the first supermarket scene, NO ONE wants to go with the woman who wants to see her kids, because they all notice that something is wrong out there. Then, suddenly, they all want to go. (This woman, btw, is seen in the last seconds of the movie to be still alive, which is just not plausible at all.)<br/><br/>4. The whole movie builds around the premise that A FULL GLASS FRONT of several hundred square meters is an insurmountable obstacle for these monsters. But wait, the monsters tried like crazy to bang in the garage door in the back... Give me a break. After the flying baby-elephant-birds get in by accident, why would the monsters not charge a full-blown attack on the windows? IN particular, as they seem to be attracted to light and everybody is giving their best effort to hold every available light source in the windows all the time.<br/><br/>5. The main character and his friends try everything to keep people from going outside as certain death awaits you there. Then, however, suddenly they decide that they need to urgently go outside themselves. SEVERAL TIMES. Right, when it is convenient for the plot.<br/><br/>6. Did I mention the bad acting yet? And the dialog?<br/><br/>7. The whole idea of men actually being the real monsters is so in your face and cheap, I wanted to vomit.<br/><br/>8. People change their minds and sides in this movie like their underwear. E.g. the sort of retarded guy with the baseball cap. One second, he is with the reasonable crowd, trying to talk sense into people and stop them from getting killed. Then suddenly, he is with the religious lunatics, demanding the boy as human sacrifice?!?<br/><br/>9. Speaking of the religious lunatics. This whole storyline is just plain stupid and too broadly worn. Clearly, this Misses Jesus is not in her right mind. Still, scene after - painfully boring - scene, they let her preach and continue to spread her rubbish. Everybody just makes fun of her at first. In the end, however, she has gathered a huge cult following (where did all these people come from, btw?) who mercilessly kill the soldier and are even willing to sacrifice a boy!!<br/><br/>10.

THE ENDING: So, after the fuel has ""suddenly"" run out (which they could have easily prevented), they decide to commit suicide within a matter of minutes. After before, they have endured all the craziness at the super market for days. And the main guy did everything he could to survive and protect his son. Within a minute, the hero shoots them all, including his own son, without second thoughts or further hesitation. Then, he just starts screaming like a maniac. And within, at the most, one more minute, the whole mist suddenly clears off and there are hundreds of military everywhere. Who, by the way, do not seem to take notice of him."

"Tweekums","9","2","5","2 October 2016"," A bleak tale of monsters in the mist
","As this film opens a storm strikes a small Maine town damaging the lakeside property of protagonist David Drayton; an unusual mist is visible over the lake but they don't give it much though. David then drives into town with his son and his neighbour to pick up some supplies. On the way they see several emergency vehicles as well as military vehicles from the local base; again they don't give the matter too much thought. Once there they get their supplies but before they can leave the supermarket a man runs in shouting about something dangerous in the mist. Within minutes the whole area is engulfed in a thick fog and the store shakes as if there was an earthquake. One person goes out but all the people inside hear are screams. David and some others go to work on the generator and when they open the back door a tentacle reaches in and grabs one of them. When the others in the store are told what happened some don't believe it and one woman, Mrs. Carmody, decides what is happening is clearly what was foretold in the Book of Revelation. After some arguing the former group leave and disappear into the mist. Soon more creatures appear; this time giant insects drawn to the lights. Some get in and by the time they have been driven back another person is dead and Mrs. Carmody is more convinced than ever that it is all the work of a vengeful god. People start to turn on each other and it isn't long before Mrs. Carmody and her followers decide that somebody must be sacrificed of course one is never enough. Eventually David and a few others decide to make a break for it but will they be able to get to his car and even if they can is there anywhere left to go to?<br/><br/>This film, based on a story by Stephen King, is one of the bleakest I've seen for some time; not because of the creatures that keep picking people off but because of the way it shows people turning on each other as soon as thing get bad even before they have the slightest inkling of just how bad they will get. The people don't come together; instead they form factions and turn on each other. The fact that most of the film takes place within the crowded shop adds a sense of claustrophobia. The creatures are suitably scary; giant insects and similar creatures are somehow more frightening than strange monsters. There is a slight sense of mystery about where they came from but there are plenty of hints that mean it isn't a total surprise when we find out. The film concludes with an ending that viewers will love or hate; I can't imagine too many people being neutral on the matter as it is so incredibly downbeat. The cast does a solid job; Thomas Jane impresses as David and Laurie Holden does a fine job as the woman who helps look after his son. There are also good supporting turns from the likes of Toby Jones and Andre Braugher but it is Marcia Gay Harden who stands out as the religious zealot Mrs. Carmody; a character more disturbing than any of the creatures. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good horror movie and doesn't expect a happy ending."
"CRJtheFirst","4","2","5","27 February 2016"," Terrible, but not for all the reasons people say
","Let me start off by saying that I didn't mind the ending, which everyone here really seems to hate. I also actually admired the anti-religious message, because it accurately depicts how cults and religions are started. That's all the things good about this movie.<br/><br/>It starts off showing us the poster of 'The Thing' in the background, one of my favorite movies of all time. This shows it desperately wants to emulate that movie's feel and boy, does it fall flat. I could predict every death before it happened, just watch out for people looking confusedly into nothingness.<br/><br/>The scares in the movie are 96% reliant on jump scares, which are the microwave burgers of scares. And if the movie relies on it being scary, that's a bit of an issue. It also would help if the movie had any likable characters (I counted one, the older lady). The main character is your boring, standard good looking father who just wants to look after his annoying son. The other characters are either too boring to remember or stereotypes, so no-one really to root for.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled. This isn't nearly as good as 'The Fog', 'The Thing', or hell even '28 Days Later', which I also disliked. Give it a skip."

"Screen_Blitz","9","2","5","17 December 2015"," Frank Darabont's The Mist is terrifying, visceral cinematic tale based on the works by Stephen King
","Stephen King has been held as the master of horror in the world of literacy. Love or hate him, there is no doubt that his works have left an impact on both writers and filmmakers everywhere. This horror novel 'The Mist' is the subject of this terrifying sci- fi/horror endeavor, and is operated by the hands of Frank Darabont who helmed the American classic 'Shawshank Redemption, another film based on King's works. Like Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' (which King was disappointed with) this film sees Darabont taking liberties from King's acclaimed source material and using it for appealing cinematic horror advantages. His solid direction more than works, it excels the film into a thought-provoking, frightening experience that will hold no bars on haunting viewers long after the end credits roll. Even those with a strong muscle against the spookiest cinematic pictures will find themselves curling into a fetal position. The story has not a married man descending into mental insanity and wielding an axe, it is something shockingly more terrifying. This film is set in Maine and follows David Drayton (played by Thomas Jane), a husband and father who takes his eight- year old son Billy (played by Nathan Gamble) and his neighbor Brent (played by Andre Braugher) on a trip to a local convenience store for supplies after a violent thunderstorm causes damage to their house. Soon, the trio along with the rest of the shoppers are alarmed by sirens that go off and the sight of a bloodied man running into the store shouting ""something in the mist!"". Within minutes, the entire town is swallowed by an enormous fog, trapping everyone inside. It is not long before the shoppers learn the sinister secrets of this mysterious phenomenon when a horde of otherworldly creatures break inside and begin preying on them. <br/><br/>This is not quite as much of a monster flick as it is of a survival film. After all, the main focus surrounds a large group of confused individuals trapped together coping with confusion what on to do under terrifying situations. Nonetheless, Frank Darabont holds no restraints in showcasing the characters' terrifying fight for survival which ends in a series of bloodbaths as the grotesque- looking beasts preying on human flesh. So you do not want to grow emotionally attracted to any characters, because some of them may not last long. And if you bear a weak stomach to gory imagery, take caution because there will be some things you will likely wish to unsee. Furthermore, Darabont proves to be more than capable to maintaining an ominous atmosphere that leave audiences alternating between curling up in their seat and loading their heads and thoughts of what the characters are feeling and what they would do if they were in a similar situation. The visceral tension uproots not just from the blood-thirsty creatures terrorizing the store, but also between poor shoppers themselves. If that isn't enough, there is another antagonist beside the monsters on board, and that Marcia Gay Harden's character Mrs. Carmody, a religious extremist who perceives the unsettling event as the ""End of Days"". Harden packs a punch with her performance, electrifying her role with pure fortitude and heart-thumping humility. If the film deserves any Oscar nomination of any kind, it would most certainly for her in the supporting role. The scariest aspect of her character is that she is mentally unstable and is so buried into her spirituality she is willing to put others in grave danger to preserve her faith. Above all, the tension is powerful, the danger is harrowing, and the atmosphere is purely gut-wrenching as the story builds to a finale that leave many viewers shocked to the core. <br/><br/>The Mist is a purely terrifying horror experience that rests in the front ranks of one of the scariest horror pictures Hollywood has delivered in recent memory. In an alternate of words, it marks not only an astounding effort by director Frank Darabont who embraces Stephen King's absorbing source material, but an inspiring cinematic endeavor that truly knows what scary is. If there is any caution to taken before sitting through this film, it is preparing yourself emotionally for the ending that can only be described in one word: Haunting."

","Frank Darabont directed this controversial and compelling film adaptation of the Stephen King story that stars Thomas Jane as David Drayton, who notices a strange mist hovering over a lake near his home. Later on in a grocery store, the mist has spread, and after an earthquake, it becomes obvious that something is alive in the mist, perhaps many things, that are also merciless and murderous, and the resultant fear of the isolated shoppers leads to a paranoid mania involving the religious Mrs. Carmody(played by Marcia Gay Harden) prompting those not under her spell to make a daring break for it, but tragedy awaits... A film made famous by that ending, which is just a punch in the gut. This film fully explores the idea of horror, and however you choose to interpret the meaning of the ending, it will not be easily forgotten.

Quickly it becomes apparent the true monsters are not outside the supermarket but are, in-fact, inside it.<br/><br/>The film stays true to the novella while taking some artistic liberties and adds to the story.

"georgestaggidis","1","2","5","11 October 2013"," Simply bad...
","OK, every movie has a protagonist. The movie is more or less based on the protagonist who is supposedly the wiser or stronger than the rest. This holds up well till about the middle of the film. After that, you just start to wonder how smart is this guy really or, rather, what's wrong with the plot? If you know what is out there is on a killing spree, you don't go out there. As simple as that. You do what you can to ""hold the line"" as best you can till help arrives. That is your best shot. You don't go on a road trip with your car...<br/><br/>Also you have a lawyer who doesn't want to look at evidence?? Lawyers seek and thrive on evidence. So, the lawyer acting like ""no i don't want to see the evidence of the monsters, which is in the storage room 10 feet from me"", and acting like nothing bad is going on, just isn't believable (even if we're watching a movie with extra-dimensional monsters!)<br/><br/>And in the end of the film.... What kind of an ending is that? First of all, what kind of a person shoots his own son? Even if they are going to be eaten by monsters. Take your chance! Even if it is very small! At least then the blood of your son and of your friends wouldn't be on your hands! And there is a slight percent you, your son and your friends, might actually live!! Like the lady from the beginning of the film who actually made it, with her kids, even if everyone thought she would die (she is on the truck at the end of the film with her kids). Small chance is better than no chance, anytime!<br/><br/>Second of all, and that was hilarious, almost like a comedy. The mist clears up 5 minutes after he has killed his son and friends??? This isn't only ironic, its absurd and a joke...<br/><br/>All in all, the plot leaks...badly...and the holes in the plot just make you wonder why you are watching the film in the first place."
"Ishamaeli","2","2","5","14 July 2013"," It's Evolution meets The Happening, directed by Ridley Scott.
","The fear of the unknown is the central focus of The Mist, along with the psychological effects of a random group of people being forced into a survival situation in an enclosed space. (Think Lord of the Flies but with a tangible outside threat; the outcome is pretty much the same, however.) A curious mix of characters creates added tension - Marcia Gay Harden's performance as the intensely religious Mrs. Carmody is superb - and promises an interesting study into human nature when faced with an unknown threat. Unfortunately, the premise soon deteriorates into bad CGI and illogical actions taken by the central characters.<br/><br/>The Mist is clearly trying to do the same thing that The Happening did heaps better a year later, the difference being that while the explanation for the events in The Happening is plausible (if quite far-fetched), The Mist takes the easy way out of the plot it's twisted around itself by tacking on a ridiculous explanation for the mist and the monsters. Granted, I reckon it could have worked if it had been written into the movie better, but as it is, it feels like a cop out.<br/><br/>It could be that Mrs. Carmody's religious fervour is meant as a warning against extreme beliefs and mass hysteria, in which case good, though it's a tad heavy-handed. Other than this, the main characters are hardly sympathetic; the kid, Billy Drayton (Nathan Gamble), is the most likable of them all, with the refreshingly sensible Amanda Dunfrey (Laurie Holden) as a close second. Frances Sternhagen deserves a special mention; her character, the elderly Irene Reppler, is one kick-ass grandma.<br/><br/>All in all, The Mist is a good idea turned into a terrible, boring movie that tries to score points with unimaginative gore and the shock value of psychological weirdness. The ending would be its redeeming feature - if only the rest of it weren't so bad."

This was a very good adaptation of the novel and he characters were portrayed well. I do have a few complaints though. As opposed to the novel, you get very little background on the characters. A moviegoer who hasn't read the book would be confused by this lack of background. The action scenes are also a problem in my opinion. They are few in number and could be lengthened slightly to add a more dramatic effect to the movie. Aside from these personal complaints I think the movie was a very well done adaptation."
"walter-plitt","4","2","5","3 June 2013"," Lost in the mist
","I inadvertently bumped into this movie because I was told that it possessed the reminiscent mood of classic Lovecraft's stories. This film is essentially a pastiche of a sequence of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" with a group of people trapped and under attack by a supernatural force. This film has the eternal cliché of people trapped in places like supermarkets and shops, to avoid explanations as where the bathroom is, or where we will find food and water.<br/><br/>This film aims to honor the great John Carpenter and because of its inefficiency to establish a convincing rhythm, it abuses of unnecessary, stumbling fade outs. This movie spends five or ten minutes of small talk between characters that soon after, are slaughtered , disemboweled by stupid fanatics or ""bitten by mosquitoes from hell"" and make the audience wonder ""Why you spent time telling this particular story?"" To create a ""realistic"" mood and to build a screenplay with the appropriate""density""? The construction of characters should be a natural and fluid process for the development of the script, not a ridiculous and vulgar parenthesis that leads straight to nothing (or the grave). Speaking of the grave, the director, near the end, must be thought ""What can I possibly create for this thing now, not to be remembered merely as a bad horror and suspense movie?"" Then he had the most brilliant idea - to create the most manipulative and stupid end imaginable, comparable only to that one, where the character wakes up to realize it was all a dream. Many supposedly well educated people (by the internet), take this kind of thing seriously and think this ridiculous form of ""shock treatment"" is somehow memorable. It is just as memorable as an example for writers to analyze the subject ""how to kick everything into space when nothing goes right."" The use of fog is obviously a way to reduce the costs of ridiculous CGI monsters. With no doubt, Stephen King is the ultimate synonymous of silly horror books and movies, with the exception of ""The Shinning"", because Stanley Kubrick was able to transform anything into gold ."

And so do the characters in the movie. It all starts whit a storm followed by a very strange unnatural looking mist followed by an Earthquake. Just before the Earthquake someone comes running in bleeding and screaming: ""there's something in the mist!"".So they all lock themselves up in the supermarket and have no clue what happened or what to do next.<br/><br/>At first they start fighting over the fact that some talk about monsters and others say its bullshit but thats just the beginning.<br/><br/>Its when they all saw and met some monsters that the movie becomes really interesting.

","I really got a kick out of this one! Based on a novel by Stephen King, and filtered through the lens of the director of the Walking Dead, this feature sticks the spotlight on a group of townsfolk holed-up in a supermarket to avoid the extradimensional invaders outside. Despite the b-movie premise, this film is elevated by some memorable, enthusiastic performances (check out Marcia Gay Harden as Bible-thumping Mrs Carmody), and an excellent psychological edge which sets the townsfolk against each other. Indeed, the herd mentality and fanaticism of the townsfolk poses just as existential a threat to our protagonists as the creatures intent on eviscerating them (so much so, I hoped the invaders made chili con carne out of most of them).<br/><br/>Oh, yes...after two tense hours, the movie has a conclusion that kicks you in the teeth---twice!"
"StevePulaski","9","2","5","11 May 2012"," Consuming like the fog itself
","This is my first viewing of Frank Darabont's The Mist in about five years and the first time I have watched it in black and white. If there's anyway to watch the film, it's to sit down, deep in the night, and watch it completely drained of color. Seeing it in theaters, the idea was creepy, but adding black and white to it makes it an entirely different experience. The film opens with a three minute introduction with Darabont himself explaining how he has had people say that it would be ""cool"" if The Mist could be made in a colorless fashion, to replicate and pay subtle homage to the classic Universal monster films that inspired it. As anyone would believe, marketing a black and white horror film, in a day and age where special effects and bright, vivid colorization is the norm, the idea would flounder with audiences, likely wouldn't resonate too well, and probably wind up doing middling numbers. Just before the film begins, Darabont states that this is the version he recommends you see. The colored version helps illustrate the ideas and events in a more compelling and plausible way, where as the black and white version seems to be more concerned with atmosphere and implausibility. It knows it's a campy, downright outrageous monster flick, but in the mean-time, it almost feels like we're watching two different films; one concerned with realism and monsters and the other concerned with intelligence and depth.<br/><br/>Seeing both, I believe I could write two separate and very different reviews on each, but I refuse. I can sum up my ideas coherently into one. Stephen King's novel ""The Mist"" remains my favorite by him for its simplicity, its depth, and its exploration of characters pushed to the limit. It's a ""what would you do?"" kind of picture that is equal parts claustrophobic horror and psychological thriller.<br/><br/>The film is centered around David Drayton (Jane), a movie poster painter with a wife and young child named Billy (Gamble). After a wild, rambunctious storm blows through their town in the Stephen King locale of Maine, David is forced to confront his neighbor Brent (Braugher) whom he's had a contentious relationship with over the years. The three of them head out to the grocery store, hoping to pick up some food and supplies since they are in the mix of a power outage. Their shopping trip is unexpectedly interrupted when a man runs in screaming with blood running down his face that something is in the mist that is currently blowing in. The scene where the mist flows quietly into the area, before consuming the supermarket in its entirety is masterful, sort of noir-istic in its black and white form, yet far too short. A trip to the storage room, the workers and David discover that something really is in the mist. Something with six large tentacles, among a wide variety of other undefinable beasts that seem to be composed of parts taken from other familiar insects. Whatever the hell they are, they are creepy, mysterious, yet intriguing and limitless.<br/><br/>The remainder of the film takes place in the store, as the townspeople try to comprehend the fact that unrecognized beings are preying on them from the outside and the fact that they are trapped in a store full of people they don't truly know. One of the most annoying characters is Marcia Gay Harden's Mrs. Carmody, the ultra-religious, god-fearing fanatic who preaches how ""we the people"" asked for this with our constant disrespect for God and his teachings. While I hated her character back then, and in black and white she's still a distasteful witch, Harden plays her in an undeniably brilliant fashion. It isn't easy to bring so much passion and soul to a character so unlikable, but it works because of the gifted material and script given to her. Thomas Jane, a rather under-used actor, plays his role as the main protagonist well, and handles the stressful situation with realism and integrity. One character that seems to get the unfortunate cold shoulder is Toby Jones' Ollie, as one of the store's employees. Sometimes, when he is on screen, he invites a strongly ominous presents almost as gripping as the thick fog outside.<br/><br/>What Darabont knows how to do is to trap his characters not only geographically, but mentally, and always bring up the ideas of hope and fear by structuring substantial teams with the characters. I was constantly reminded of how The Shawshank Redemption (almost every director has their own masterpiece and that is Darabont's) portrayed the drastically different characters and their unique views on life and how they handled being confined to four walls and cynicism. There were teams in the prison, and there are teams in The Mist. The civilians turned radicals, as well as the collective group of people who just want to try and remain civil and try to keep everyone else in a state of calmness. Unfortunately, that rarely works out, especially during a riveting third act.<br/><br/>The ending, I must say, whether seen in color or black and white is one of the saddest in any horror film in the last decade. One would think the absence of color would drown the value of emotions, but frankly, it could be argued that it intensifies them by making them seem bleaker, more abstract, and even more joyless. I'd like to hear what color Darabont believes has greater effect on the ending.<br/><br/>The Mist is a strong piece of film, frightening to comprehend, sometimes maddeningly explicit in its monologues, and incorruptibly entertaining throughout. If there's one thing we should've learned by now, it's that Maine is not a safe state to inhabit.<br/><br/>Starring: Thomas Jane, Nathan Gamble, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, Andre Braugher, Toby Jones, and Melissa McBride. Directed by: Frank Darabont."

","Without spoiling much for those who have not watched it, i will say that if you can withstand Marcia Harden's irritating character for the major portion of the film, the ending, is definitely going to move you to tears and how is where the magic of the movie lies. It might seem to be just another horror flick but trust me, its not. And the climax...my oh my, it is the one you will never be able to forget, so just sit down and watch the story unfold...and trust me you will not regret it. Stephen king has written a million stories and a lot of them had been made into movies, but this is by far the best i have watched, well apart from shaw-shank redemption. I would also like to mention the performance of Thomas Zane, who stands apart in this movie from all others and gives a dominant performance, especially the end scene where he showcases what a fine actor he is. Apart from that, i think Toby Jones, the actor who plays Ollie was also a major feature of this film. Too bad, they killed him so unceremoniously. So watch this, and i assure you that you will never have to watch torture porns to get your chills and thrills. This, my dear folks, is how a horror film should be."
"smccar77","6","2","5","14 March 2011"," An overlong film unreflective of the author's or director's talents
","""The Mist,"" is an adaption of a Stephen King story by a director now famed for these adaptations. Unlike, Shawshank or Green Mile, Mist is a supernatural horror film. One may expect that taking on a theme more typical to King would lead to a highly entertaining film. Unfortunately, the result is overlong and never escapes a ""b"" movie feel.<br/><br/>Clocking in at two hours, Mist lavishes time on creating a moody and oppressive atmosphere of unknown horrors. Firmly situated in the creepy context are the typical cast of King stock characters. The film focuses on the interactions of these characters more so than on the monsters or ominous fog. The result is a drawn out and rather predictable exploration of how a highly caricatured ""humanity"" deals with an abnormal situation. The assumption seems to be that by giving developed exposition to stock characters, a sense of realism and an important message can be established. The problem is that stock characters are by definition shallow. By creating easily identifiable character types, the audience is relieved of the need to analyze character action. For example, the ignorant country bumpkin will always respond in a bigoted and violent way. Developing such a bumpkin does nothing to the expectation that said character will ultimately respond as expected. In fact, lavishing time on hollow stock types eventually highlights just how poorly developed these characters are. The effect is a film that is populated by annoying people doing highly predictable things.<br/><br/>In fairness, the film does end with a twist. Unfortunately, some of the dramatic weight of the twist is removed because of the characters. Having been methodically ushered down the garden path, the final actions are somewhat inevitable, expected, and emotionally bland.<br/><br/>As a whole, Mist is a technically accomplished movie. The editing, camera work, stylization and direction are all highly competent. The problems arise with the writing and the story itself. Both writing and story rely so heavily on stock characterization that the film comes off as a modern take on a 1950's horror ""b"" film. All attempts to create a more realistic sense of foreboding are overshadowed by shallow characters puttering about in predictable ways.<br/><br/>On a personal note, this film strikes me as being a wonderful introduction to someone wholly ignorant of both horror film and/or Stephen King. The reliance on stock characters is well done, as long as one is not overly familiar with such character types. Unfortunately, finding such a specifically ignorant audience is a very tall order. Therefore, the mist will highly impress a scant few, and merely satiate the horror tastes of the masses. 5.7 of 10 stars."
"B-Sleazy","8","2","5","7 November 2010"," More about human horrors than the supernatural...
","While I'm not the biggest fan of Stephen King's writings, several movie adaptations of his works can be counted among my favorites. The Shining, Carrie, and Stand By Me all deliver on character depth and story. While the same holds true for Frank Darabont's adaptation of The Mist, it does not shine (sorry) quite the same as those classics.<br/><br/>As the tag-lines and other movie materials suggest, the film focuses more heavily on the horrors of humanity inside than the monsters outside the windows. Considering how little the film relies on generic archetypes, we are surprisingly allowed thorough opportunity to identify the various major characters and their roles in the story. While there are but a few unexpected developments in the relationships between the characters, it's the unrestrained demonstrations of the devolution of humanity that make this film interesting. As the story continues and tensions grow, we become just as concerned about the characters as we are about the story itself.<br/><br/>While the leading actor, Thomas Jane, certainly disappoints in his attempts to come across as...a human being, Laurie Holden and various supporting cast members make up for it. Much attention is lavished (and rightly so) upon Marcia Gay Harden's role as the religious zealot-cum-cult leader, Toby Jones has to be noted for his stand-out performance. Based on his body-type and initial demeanor, many would expect him to play the underdog role. However, he plays the character with an in-control, take-charge attitude from the start, never having to come from behind, while still maintaining a very approachable, caring personality.<br/><br/>Practical effects and visceral monsters are the responsibility of Greg Nicotero and KNB Efx, and perhaps they should have been relied upon more heavily, as opposed to turning to CGI. CGI is always (to me) a disappointing element in every film that contains it, however, I must note that I was surprised to learn that certain elements which I thought to be physical items, were actually CGI accents on the dressed sets.<br/><br/>The music serves its purpose in the film, supporting the growing paranoia and fear, but it doesn't really stand out or draw any kind of notice. The camera work becomes looser and more ragged as the story develops, effectively mimicking the emotional and mental duress of the characters.<br/><br/>In short, people go crazy, monsters are scary, Thomas Jane is possibly a robot in real life, and this isn't a bad option for spending a couple of hours of your life.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, no spoiler, but the ending was more satisfying than I could have possibly hoped."

I know many people were disappointed by the end of the film, but in my opinion, this ending made the movie unique. Yes..maybe it could be even better at some points, but there will always be people complaining about things they didn't like in the movie. I believe it touched the perfection.

"lewiskendell","8","2","5","21 August 2010"," One of my favorite horror flicks of the 2000s.
","""Well...we got four. Four bullets.""<br/><br/>The Mist is probably my favorite Stephen King adaptation. When military experimentation opens a door to another dimension, a small town in the northeast U.S. is swiftly and completely blanketed by a thick fog. A fog inhabited by terrifying creatures that may mean the end of everything. A group of people trapped inside a supermarket must then try to survive dangers both external and internal. <br/><br/>Since this is based on a King story, you know that there's going to be more to it than just monsters killing humans. Conflict between the people in the store is just as much of a threat as the horrors of the mist, and outsiders versus the town natives and misguided fanaticism brought about by fear are two of the major themes of the plot. It's nice when a horror movie is interesting beyond the usual shocks and gore, and that's one of the strong points of The Mist.<br/><br/>I thought the creature designs were good, if not amazing. They looked suitably frightening for the most part, and the actors did a good job of reacting to the beasts, which is always important with CG creatures. Another strong (and very King-esquire) point was the ending, which was absolutely fantastic. I think this would be worth seeing for the ending, alone.<br/><br/>The Mist gets a full recommendation from me. It's horrifying (if you have a aversion to spiders like me, you will be permanently scarred), and has that trademark Steven King vibe that elevates it beyond typical horror. It's been a few years since the first time I've seen it, but it still was just as entertaining the second time around. That's about the best compliment that a horror movie can get."

"imdbbl","Null","2","5","24 June 2010"," Bland and boring
","After a vicious storm wreaks havoc in their small town in Maine, artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) heads out to the town supermarket for some much-needed supplies with his young son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor, Norton (Andre Braugher), in tow. Their trip soon turns to terror when a menacing white mist settles in, leaving this group of locals and out-of-towners fighting for survival against an unknown, bloodthirsty enemy. When the local religious zealot (Marcia Gay Harden) begins to convince the group that the mist is punishment from God, Drayton and his cohorts realize that they may be trapped inside with an enemy just as dangerous as whatever is lurking outside. Tension runs high in this tale as the trapped group faces difficult moral decisions. Should they stay and wait out the terror, or make a break for it and risk suffering a terrible fate? <br/><br/>The Mist is an incredibly bland film. There's that mysterious atmosphere and a little bit of tension because of the unknown but nothing really that excites you. The film also has this claustrophobic sensation, not because the action takes place in the same spot during the entire film but because the plot is always the same. There's all kinds of nasty cgi monsters, some little, some big, some with wings, some with tentacles and then there's the group of civilians who have to defend themselves and this goes on for more then an hour. Plus, the film isn't scary at all, more disgusting and nasty then anything else. At one point the film turns into a morality play but by then I was completely exhausted and fed up.<br/><br/>The acting was solid and the film was well directed, but as I said, the script (which is inspired by a Stephen King novella) doesn't do anything for me. We've seen this kind of story hundreds of times, it's just not that effective anymore, at least for me.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Foxbarking","4","2","5","22 May 2010"," I Wanted to Like this Movie
","About halfway through the mist, I was thinking it was a solid IMDb 7 star movie. However, as it went on, my rating kept falling. It's very strange because I actually felt bad about not liking this movie. However, after it was over, I feel I am being extremely generous giving it four stars.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is a little too slow for me. Generally, this is not an issue as I prefer movies to have time to work on the plot and character development. Also, Mrs. Carmody needs the time to gain the power and the followers that she developed. However, for me, this is not what happened. The drawn out scenes were the action scenes and I think they spent too much time on those.<br/><br/>In contrast, when Mrs. Carmody actually becomes the powerful and leader of the fragmented group of people, her reign is cut very short. Don't get me wrong here, though. For me, Mrs. Carmody's demise was the absolute best part of the movie. Once the credits started to roll, I had to rewind to that part and watch it again.<br/><br/>So, perhaps it's not that the pacing is slow, but that it is slow in the wrong places and fast in the wrong places. Several times, I found myself drifting away from the film and concentrating on other things in the room. This is definitely not the effect the movie should have had on me.<br/><br/>Finally, I disliked the ending very much. It was a brave concept and could have been done a lot better. I like the idea of what happened (not as a person, but as a writer and trying something new), but it was done incorrectly. Less than two minutes pass by after David kills everyone in the car before the mist clears up and the soldiers show up. I found this highly unbelievable. If David had passed out in the car and woken up hours later and seen everything, that would have worked great. However, two minutes passed. It was hokey and I cannot really recommend this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the biggest disappointments I have ever had with a horror movie...and that is saying a lot."
"Diego_rjc","8","2","5","1 March 2010"," Darabont and King do it again!
","Stephen King. You probably know him. The 62 years-old American author is one of the best writers in the horror genre. His novels, novellas, and tales have been adapted to the big screen more than 100 times. All-time classics like Brian De Palma's 'Carrie' or Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' and many others are all based on his novels. Frank Darabont. You probably don't know him. He is the guy behind two of the best King's adaptations - the 1994's 'The Shawshank Redemption' and the 1999's 'The Green Mile'. And back in 2007, six years after after Darabont's last picture ('The Majestic'), he decided to adapted another King's novel, 'The Mist'. Well, he did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>'The Mist''s story is focused on a small group of people that are trapped into a supermarket after a giant mist covers the whole town they live in - a small city in Maine. Afraid of what is outside, they lock themselves into the market - only to find out later that there are blood-thirst creatures hiding in the mist. Among these people, there is David Drayton, a local artist (Thomas Jane), his son Billy (Nathan Gamble), Mrs. Carmody, a very religious woman (Marcia Gay Harden), Brent Norton, a lawyer (Andre Braugher), etc. While 'The Mist' could be defined a a monster movie, it shows more of human relations than anything else. The movie's story is all about how people react to the unknown and the unexplainable. This script, focused on character development ans study, is great, with a excellent storyline and development. The only problem me and most of the critics is the movie's ending. Frank Drabaont completely changed Stephen King's original ending - and for worse. Of course I'm not gonna spoil it here, but Darabont's ending is just plain stupid and doesn't make sense with the rest of the movie. Only if he had sticked to the original ending...<br/><br/>The acting here is average. Of course this isn't the kind of movie where the acting is the strongest point, but they did a nice job. At least the movie was well-casted, and while you get a few members doing a good job, like Marcia Gay Harden and Nathan Gamble, in a good performance by a child, others are too normal, like the own Thomas Jane. Of course there isn't no one really bad here, but no one is great either. Nothing award-worth.<br/><br/>The directing here is absolutely perfect. This movie wouldn't be the same without Frank Darabont. His directing is calm when it has to be, frenetic when it has to be, sentimental when it has to be, and scary when it has to be. That, combined with a incredible unique style, utilizing all the directing resources, and with a perfect editing, making the movie neither too long or too short make his direction work perfect. The movie''s budget wasn't big. This is proved with the lame special effects and the bad sets. But Darabont did what he could with it. The soundtrack here isn't marvelous either, but sets the mood when it has to. When thing that bothered me was the cinematography - the movie could have a more dark mood.<br/><br/>Overral, 'The Mist' is a great horror movie from 2007. Of course it's nothing compared to the previous Dabaront/King cooperations, but it holds its own rights. The script has some really good character study, but it's ruined by the bad ending that Drabont changed from King's original story. Darabont's directing is great here, and the acting is average. Good thriller, a really nice addition to the horror genre.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This movie is one of those films that I'd highly recommend that people see once and then never see ever again. It all starts out innocently enough with some standard horror movie clichés, some other film references and even a feeling of campy tension. Then things start to go downhill immediately. Even after the downhill slide starts, I was still on board, thinking (hoping) there'd be at least a somewhat happy ending. When Marcia Gay Harden's character is observed ""talking to god"" in the bathroom, one gets the sense that this won't be a regular scary film. By the time the shopkeeper utters the phrase ""Welcome to Sesame Street. The word of the day is exculpation"" I knew this was way different than what I'd hoped. It all continues on in a gory but yet still somewhat entertaining direction, then somewhere along the way this movie just gets grim. I'm skipping a lot of detail, but believe me this is a good thing. By the end of this film, your hands won't be in the popcorn anymore, and you'll have some serious questions about why you decided to sit through this film at all.. <br/><br/>This film gave me bad dreams for a couple of weeks. So in a way, I guess it's a truly scary film. Be warned, however: It is bleak.

","This is a very good film. It takes the trouble to introduce us to the characters and is not afraid to allow people we had not expected to die. To do so. This is important because it keeps on us on our toes and as vigilant as the poor suffering folk in the terrifying tale (well, almost). From small beginnings this grows pretty big. The critters are nicely gruesome and I particularly liked some of the creepy movements and scurrying about. Almost as scary are some of those struggling to survive. I loved the blue collar/ white collar divide, I liked the way the black/white issues were raised and I felt like cheering at the way the evangelical dregs were both anticipated, articulated and generally derided. What I personally didn't like was the whining little kid. I'm probably in a minority of one here but a crying little seven year old adds nothing. I can see the awful creatures battering themselves about the place. I can see the panic in people's eyes. I don't need this to be illustrated in the tears of a child. Indeed, as much time was devoted to caring for and coping with this little mite, his removal would have left time to fill. Sow why did the lead not have say an adolescent daughter to protect - from the horrors and the male gaze? Anyway, I feel I protest too much - very enjoyable film with heart stopping ending."
"vip_ebriega","10","2","5","10 January 2010"," Not some ordinary monster movie.
","My Take: It's King done right. A first-rate and riveting adaptation.<br/><br/>If you describe THE MIST in your own words, it would be nothing more than a big-budget B-movie. The setup is there: Strange creature began to come out of a mysterious mist, caused by a military cover-up gone awry, that covers up an entire town, sending a few lucky townsfolk to take refuge in a small grocery store. And yet, there lies he question: Who are the real monsters? The creatures outside, who grab and kill anyone who dare come outside, or the people inside who have their own different agendas and beliefs, and are growing sick of each other? THE MIST is unlike any monster movie I've seen in years. In fact, it's actually pretty frightening.<br/><br/>If taken in its own B-movie merits, THE MIST works pretty well. There are ample amounts of scare and gore, and the special effects have their way of jumping out of the dark and scare you. But director Frank Darabont, who has since made a career out of making superb adaptations of Stephen King novels, wanted more out of the thing and comes up with arguably the best in its genre in years. The thrills are effective, but they are more psychological than visual, as the effectiveness of the frightening moments don't really rely on the special effects, but one the effectiveness of its performers. Thomas Jane (his second time out in a King adaptation) plays David Drayton, the hero-of-sorts of the movie, who leads the sane (or more accurately, stable) side of the trapped townsfolk who must find a way to save their skins, whilst the rest of the group as domineered by the fanatical Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes God has made her His vessel.<br/><br/>Darabont and his effects crew use some relatively low-tech effects than the typical horror/monster fare, which means the CGI monsters here are not as effectively real as in other mainstream efforts. But this proves that the technology doesn't always have to be up-to-date as long as you utilize them well on screen. Besides, there are other elements of the story worth talking about than the effects. While other movies of this sort tell about how humanity will struggle as one in the face of danger, THE MIST does the opposite. It theorizes that, if disaster strikes, the rules are thrown out the window and the law of the jungle applies (According to one character, humanity as a species is fundamentally insane). Even the ending, which will downright turn off a few number of audiences expecting the typical Hollywood fare. The dark, twisted ending doesn't really symbolize anything per se, it's there to close what already was a dark and twisted movie; it intends to stay long in you long after the screen goes black.<br/><br/>Not everyone will like the ending, or perhaps even the entire movie for its often negative view of humanity in peril (yet on that side, it portrays it with frightening speculation). Even the negative view of religion in times of peril (which, shown here, is not too different from pagan sacrifice) will shock believers to the core. But rest assured, everyone will be talking about THE MIST afterward.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

Surely, a very promising start with potential for a great fantasy/horror movie.<br/><br/>What do we find instead? An incredibly slow development -the story takes about an hour to start-, overacted and two-dimensional characters engaging in unrealistic and random behaviour, long and boring dialogues that lead nowhere, and a handful of CGI scenes trying to cover all the mess.<br/><br/>This isn't a horror movie at all. It's just another nonsensical gore/action movie with the doubtful honor of having a very promising start and an incredibly disappointing...everything else. Instead of exploring any the exciting paths the script could have taken, it sticks to the most uninteresting, unimaginative and well-worn storyline. With a such a good idea for a movie it's almost like if they did it on purpose.<br/><br/>It makes me wonder why do they spend millions of dollars in CGI if they can't even find a decent screenwriter to make the film appealing to real horror fans, or at least to anybody who goes to the movies to see more than just another chiched film about some monsters killing people."
"smellthecult-com-1","10","2","5","27 November 2009"," Monster movie with soul
","Based on a novella by Stephen King first published in the anthology Dark Forces this is, quite simply, an astonishing movie. Directed by Frank Darabont, a man with a clear love of King's output (The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile were also adaptations of King's work), this is bleak, thought provoking and challenging movie making. <br/><br/>The plot: A small town in Maine (where else?) suffers a severe thunderstorm, with trees blown down and general chaos wrought. The following day, the locals are packing the supermarket, picking up supplies to clear up the weather borne detritus when a mist rolls into town from the nearby hills, with one man racing into the supermarket, blood dripping from his face, claiming that there is 'something' in the mist. The natives are skeptical, right up to the point when tentacles emerge and snatch one of their own from under their noses. The place is locked down, with stocks piled up against the glass front of the building but, within, a new threat emerges: a vehemently religious woman who claims it is God's vengeance for our impure ways. <br/><br/>Tense, with an atmosphere so sharp you could shave a fourteen year old's scrotum with it, this is less a monster movie and more a focus on the extremes we will go to when pushed. Several things about this movie stand out and elevate it above standard 'creature feature' status, not least of which are the performances. A cast of relative unknowns deliver excellent, believable portrayals of normal folk in peril, and the heart strings are plucked throughout, though in an intelligent, logical way, not in a 'make's you want to puke out your own kidneys' sense. <br/><br/>Darabont makes fine use of lighting and, crucially, the score is an accompaniment, not the dominant feature, adding substance to scenes rather than overwhelming them, something that the Michael Bay's and Zack Snyder's of this world would do well to note. It's impossible to talk about this movie without mentioning the ending (I won't ruin it, but skip the next sentence if you'd rather know nothing) which is nothing short of astonishing. Poignant, heart wrenching and with such humanity it brings a tear to the eye, something few, if any, horror movies achieve. <br/><br/>Whilst delivering the goods in terms of gore and violence, this movie is so much more than that and one I would recommend to all, not just the usual sick in the head blood fiends.

Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>The story takes place during an alien infestation, but that is something that I would call a detail, although the aliens are extremely well rendered; it is character driven to the extreme, showing more than anything else the way people (re)act during a crisis.

All of a sudden as night falls, horrifying creatures come out of nowhere and start attacking people and eating them alive. Marcia Gay Harden as a psychotic bible-thumping nutcase warning everyone that the mist is the apocalypse. Everyone is trying to survive and make it back home alive. Some escape unharmed, others take the quick way out through suicide and others just get attacked and pulled out by the creatures. Coming to the end of the movie, if David Drayton just would have waited another 5 more minutes, he and his son and his friends would have been fine instead he uses the gun and kills his son and his three friends with no more bullets to kill himself after the fact that they have escaped and made it out to his truck and drove until it ran out of gas and after he realizes that the mist is clearing and the Army is coming through to clear out any remaining creatures and taking people to shelters for food and other medical help and needs he feels like an ass after just killing his 5 year old son. Yeah they drove by his house and seen that his wife never made it out alive and then all of a sudden he kills whats left of his family.....the last movie with Thomas Jane in it that hes the only surviving member of his family that I have seen was the Punisher. How many more movies will he do that he's the last survivor in his family? Otherwise The Mist is a great movie with a messed up ending."
"Greatornot","4","2","5","23 September 2009"," Very Uneven Movie
","Although somewhat entertaining , I felt this movie lacked . A military experiment gone awry, but never explained. Did Mr. King have a brain hiccup? The movie based on a short story is something I have seen again and again. This was nothing more than a rehashed mid 60s sci fi movie, only done on a more simple level. It was too long a movie that left out many details . The movie sort of borrowed from 'The Lord of The Flies'. As time progressed you had the stranded in the store taking a side. Go with the evangelical lady , whose dialogue consisted of biblical quotes, or side with the seculars, who just want to escape from this horrible situation. I had no problem with these scenes that portrayed this. Furthermore this film was shockingly familiar to 'Maximum Overdrive', another Stephen King film based on a short story, that was done in the early 90s...Only the villain were machines, not mutants. From an originality standpoint this film lacked bigtime."

","I loved this movie, a truly great horror film. I thought this would be another crappy ""theres something in the mist"" movie but it turned out to be a sick and dark horror film. This film had me captivated right up until the last 2 minutes. Why, why such a dark and terrible ending. The main character kills his son and three others just moments before being rescued by the army. This is extremely sad, why would the director do that to the main character, who was the most logical and nice person through out the entire story. I would give it a 10 out of 10, if not for this ending, so it deserves an 8,for how good the rest of the movie was."

But anyway, I couldn't believe it, but after I had read it from start to finish, I could honestly say that it was not as good as the movie. The Mist in the hands of Frank Darabont is one of the best horror movies ever produced. Its dark ending is a lot different from that in the book, and I thank him for it! Whilst the book gives you no real punch to the stomach, the movie ending is..well, I cried...and I never cry..except for when I watch The Mist..^^ This movie is extremely well worth all the money that is spent on it, and I am HOPING that they will make a sequel explaining and giving a deeper meaning to what happened, perhaps even traveling to the other dimension, although Stephen King did not write one...I believe it could be great in the hands of Frank Darabont! A must see for every horror lover out there..It's not a slasher, it's not even a real monster movie...it's about two worlds colliding, and the ending is not a Disney one, but everything can't be cotton candy and fluffy clouds..WATCH!"
"onyx-1","8","2","5","22 May 2009"," What made this movie amazing
","OK this movie, for the first 3/4 of it, drags along as a pretty standard ""The giants bugs are attacking!"" Burn them with fire!"" story. The only really interesting non-clichéd thing in the 1st 75% is the crazy religious lady and how she manages to convert some of the people in the store into her little death cult. <br/><br/>So why did I give a movie 3/4 of which is average at best 10/10? Yes the ending is just THAT good. The protagonist feels superior to the crazy followers of Mrs. Carmody. He never thinks HE'D do anything insane when faced with a terrifying situation but of course in the end when he faces his moment of truth he does something so insane and monstrous that it is hard to even believe.<br/><br/>The real monsters in this movie are in the human psyche and the ""hero"" is certainly not immune from them. The ending shows so clearly the futility of believing that we are all purely sane and that we aren't capable we aren't capable of heinous insane actions with the right triggers.<br/><br/>Some viewers might have thought they'd THEY'D never do anything like that (and thus squarely missed the whole point of the film) but for the rest of us this movie present a jarring reminder to never say never...We are all just humans. that is our greatest blessing and our greatest curse."

","After so many disappointing adaptations of Stephen King works,Frank Darabont has shown yet again why he is hands down the best writer and director doing King films.His first two features(he did a great short film The Woman In The Room back in 1983)Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile were both outstanding dramas set in prisons,although Green Mile had supernatural elements. I wondered what Frank would do with a full throttle King horror story.Well,he hit it right out of the park! The Mist has been a favorite story of mine since Dark Forces in 1981.Mr Darabont give us as well-scripted and directed an adaptation as we could want.The performances are all solid.The standouts are Thomas Jane as David Drayton,Toby Jones as Ollie ,and of course Marcia Gay Harden,in a terrifying and Oscar worthy turn as the fanatical Mrs Carmody.<br/><br/>The creatures are like things from a nightmare by way of an acid trip,and are really scary.Good work with CGI and makeup effects.

"buchanan17","6","2","5","13 May 2009"," It could have been an excellent horror film but...
","Unlike most reviewers here, I am not giving it 10 or 1.<br/><br/>Most of those who give it 1 either don't like the ending, or don't like the overblown religious fanaticism.<br/><br/>I don't like either, but the rest of the film is excellent, and if these two elements had been treated better I would have given this a 9 or 10.<br/><br/>First the religious stuff. I don't believe that whatever happened, 90% of the store inmates would have rallied to Mrs Carmody's rantings. In fact, she would have been silenced by more than the old lady throwing a tin of beans at her. Grossly overdone and unbelievable, even for religion-mad Americans.<br/><br/>And the ending... well, I have no problem with what actually happens (i.e. not a nice cuddly ending), but to think you'd drive for hours at 10mph through the mist and then give up just as you run out of petrol. No, daft. You tried that hard and then give up. Please.

","I thought this was a great horror movie and very worthy of it's 7+ overall score. As a fan of the more traditional horror genre, not the gore-fest teen movies that have seemingly replaced it, this fitted the bill perfectly. It was scary, funny, gloomy and shocking in equal measures. Specifically, I was left shocked by the ending and took a good couple of hours (and cigarettes) to come back down. I understand that everyone's opinions differ on movies, that's why we watch them. But I feel sorry for those crying 'poor CGI' or 'not enough info about the monsters'. Fear not, some low-life will probably pick up the baton soon and do a prequel for you that explains everything. Either that, or you could grow an imagination. So, if you fancy a scary night watching a movie that could have been made late 70s, early 80s, and you've not seen 'The Mist', give it a whirl."
"bitchyrita","7","2","5","17 March 2009"," ""The Mist"" delivers
","I had low expectations for this based on ""The Green Mile"" collaboration between King and Darabont, which was awful. I was more than pleasantly surprised. ""The Mist"" is a pretty good modern horror film, even if it has a lot of flaws.<br/><br/>After a violent storm, several locals of a tiny Maine town head to the local grocery store, and they get trapped inside by a massive cloud of mist. Psychological fear and paranoia grow, we start to see that gross monsters are out there, and there's more than just that terror to be afraid of.<br/><br/>A lot of people criticized the ending as disappointing, but I loved it. It was unpredictable and it wasn't catering to the feel-good endings we almost always get from Hollywood. It helped make the movie great. The cast was good, too, especially Thomas Jane. The creatures CGI could also have been better. Otherwise, this is one of the better horror movies in recent years."
"Eternalkid","9","2","5","21 February 2009"," Sublimely human sci-fi horror
","I have read a lot of Stephen King, and I have seen a lot of cinematic adaptations of his work.<br/><br/>When these are done well, they are masterpieces or at the very least, far above average films. Into this category I'd happily throw in The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Stand By Me, The Shining, Dreamcatcher, The Dead Zone and possibly one or two others, Pet Sematary and Cujo.<br/><br/>When adaptations are done with sub-standard actors or direction, the on-screen effect can be dismal or outright laughable. In this category, led by The Stand and It, there are sadly too many to contemplate. 1408 is an exception here, in that it had a great cast and a budget, but misses its mark. So I was delighted when I watched this new offering from King (the novella upon which it's based is top of my list to read now, and the notion that it inspired ""Silent Hill"" has only made me feel more awed at King's mind) and the writer/director that gave us Shawshank and Mile.<br/><br/>THE MIST...<br/><br/>Is ominous and haunting from beginning to bitter end. I'm shocked that this film has received such a high rating on IMDb (7.4 at time of writing) given that most audiences do not like bitter ends. And that is all I shall say about this film's finale, which is nothing if not psychologically disturbing and chilling.<br/><br/>And despite this ending being different to that in the novella (which I have read about), it is nevertheless very much in keeping with the King style. To me, it even adds to the sense of lunacy, desperation and unforgiving tension which the story offers.<br/><br/>The story, in which a mysterious, monstrously murderous mist envelops a small US town, is told with admirable restraint: a welcome quality in any effective horror film, by which a film allows the fear inside the viewer to fester and grow, aided by his own imagination. Apart from one or two contrived visual frights, the scenes with monsters in the fog, as well as those of people attempting to brave the killer mist, are incredibly tense. <br/><br/>Screams don't come when you expect them. Deaths are gruesome and aplenty, and though on the lower end of the gore scale, the human reaction to death in its various forms here makes them more realistic. The creatures, partially hidden by the mist, seem more terrifying than if seen in any other weather or time of day. The mist intensifies the sense of uncertainty, and in some cases enhances the mind-blowing magnitude of the monsters.<br/><br/>The monsters themselves, and in particular the bellowing bony behemoth at the end, are superbly and imaginatively crafted. Their presence, which grows throughout the film in both volume and size induces the fear one would expect from one's worst nightmares. Some of them come across graphically as intensely other-worldly as I have seen on screen.<br/><br/>The acting in general is superb and for a horror film, surprisingly human. Characters are shown to have not just fears, but intelligence, love, loyalty, madness, friendship, anger, faith, courage, stupidity, violence... at the first sign of a ""monster,"" the characters actually debate whether telling others what they have seen is worth it, given how unbelievable it is. The paranoia and ignorance of the small-town mentality is also scarily exposed, latching onto medieval beliefs in their hour of darkness. As is the general question of whether Man should play with things he does not understand (an issue that was also intriguingly raised in Jurassic Park). <br/><br/>The film is nearly a perfect sci-fi horror: it even pays tribute early on to John Carpenter and The Thing, which is, to my mind, still the best in this genre. The last lines of Childs and MacReady in The Thing are echoed in this film (Childs: ""What do we do now?"" MacReady: ""Why don't we just wait here for a little while... see what happens..."" - In The Mist Drayton says: ""Let's uh... see how far the... the fuel takes us, huh?"" And those could have made a very different, though equally pleasing, end to this flick). <br/><br/>I watched this film yesterday evening, and 24 hours later, I have it running around my head still, in particular its brutal ending, with its eerie music, that gargantuan creature, and the unearthly freakish noise it makes.<br/><br/>My hat off to the writer and director, who eschews a happy ending for a truly horrific one. If an Apocalypse ever comes - I pray it is nothing like this one. A must-see for horror and sci-fi fans."

A mysterious mist wrap the city and you don't know why but is not good. Well, The Mist lasted for me 20 min. Once you know what is out there the movie lose everything. I've seen recently Silent Hill and the mist there provided more atmosphere than here. Especial Fx aren't good neither, even bad. Actually, the horror is inside the store. With Marcia Gay Harden (Mrs. Carmody) performing than good that you wanna kill her in her second line. Reading the book you feel claustrophobic, you want to get out of the store watching what's happening inside too but you are scare of what's outside. I didn't get that feeling neither in the movie. I didn't care at all.<br/><br/>It's predictable, lame, flat and it didn't get me at any moment but hey, is just me. The final twist, I have to admit, took me by surprise, you don't expect it at all.<br/><br/>If I would have gone to theatre to watch it I would have felt swindled.

","A surprisingly evocative film, and probably not something you'd expect to see under the title 'The Mist' or of the horror genre. Although, superficially, you've got a fairly decent monster- fest, don't be fooled, this film is so much more. Ultimately, it takes a long, hard look at how fallible we are as humans; despite all of our advances, our basal and primal nature will always be the one to drive our survival, no matter the cost. <br/><br/>Our message from King, which is driven home in a deft and utterly ruthless manner is that the true creatures of the dark are the ones we find inside ourselves, which is displayed poignantly throughout the film. And the most touching of all, is probably the knowledge that it is always darkest before the dawn.<br/><br/>A must see."
"Xyphoid_Corporation","8","2","5","17 January 2009"," Best horror without a lot of gore
","This is one of the best horror-movie I've seen in years. Maybe I'm biased, because I like most Stephen King stories. But this movie is in my best-horror-movies-without-a-lot-of-gore list along with ""Needful Things"" (also a Stephen King story), ""The Ring"" (the original Japanese version) and ""Cube"". Most of these movies deal with real horror: human behaviour. What will people do in certain situations? Before I go on I want to state that I also like horror with a little more gore, like ""Saw"" for example.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" tells us how far people will go when they find themselves in a situation that is scary and/or confusing. I think that the group of people in the movie is a reflection of today's society and that King is trying to show us what we might do when the world is really going to hell and society falls apart. I used ""might"" and not ""will"" because not everybody will react the same, but this is a pretty believable scenario (the reaction part, not the monsters in the mist part) and it teaches us that sometimes it's better to act according to instinct and feeling, like the woman in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't give it a 10/10, because the special effects look cheap at some times, but luckily there aren't many scenes that have special effects. The ending is great, but the reason for it to end this way should have been written better.<br/><br/>If you like horror-movies where you have to leave your brain turned on, than, check out ""The Mist"", else stick with ""Saw""."
"davideo-2","9","2","5","17 January 2009"," Another rare successful King adaptation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is a successful New York commissioned painter who lives a quiet life with his son in a small American town. Following a fierce storm the night before, his new piece is ruined and he is thrown into some turmoil with his neighbour Andre Braugher (Brent Norton) another recluse with NY connections, which are resolved when he offers to drive him to the store. But this turns out to be the worst thing he could have done, as a huge mist appears out of nowhere and everyone in the store finds themselves trapped inside. It soon becomes clear murderous alien invaders are lurking in the thick fog outside and, trapped and couped up together, tensions mount among those in the store, stirred up most by a fanatical religious woman named Mrs Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) whose theories behind their predicament end up causing some to take her side. The voice of reason in a sea of hysteria, David must draw on all his resources and get himself and his son out alive.<br/><br/>Give most film makers a script adapted from a Stephen King novel/short story and chances are they'll co*k it up like nobody's business. Give one to Frank Darabont, however, and he seems to have an unusual knack for making them work, from The Shawshank Redemption (one of the greatest films ever made), to The Green Mile and now this effective horror film. Not receiving quite so much press exposure at the time of it's release, it pretty much came and went on it's arrival in cinemas but sometimes it would appear this is the case with the really good films.<br/><br/>Once again, this is one of his works I've not got round to reading (not even sure if it's a novel/SS) but in this case, it's no less effective and easy to appreciate as a film on it's own. Darabont, with his style of camera lens, eerie lack of soundtrack and generally effective plotting, has crafted a horror with a creepy sense of atmosphere and impending doom, with a suspenseful main story with plenty of unexpected twists and turns. For the type of film it is, maybe it goes on a bit too long, but Darabont was never one for short and sweet, and sticking with it to the end is your best shot.<br/><br/>Jane, a star I've come to associate more with action films, does a much better job than expected of carrying the lead role, delivering a startling emotional out pouring at the end, but the star of the show is Harden as the preachy, twisted, demented religious nut, who manages to twist people's minds more than make them resent her. There's plenty of great support, too, from Laurie Holden (from The Majestic), Braugher, Bill Sadler and Darabont veteran Dan Hedaya. That's not to mention some superb special effects in the shape of the slimy alien creatures, as well as the Del Toro esquire fly things that invade the store at one point.<br/><br/>Another King/Darabont smash, you might not be able to see through The Mist but you should definitely try and see it. ****"
"johnnyboyz","7","2","5","10 January 2009"," Hazy, mysterious and with a distinct kick; The Mist holds up as a rather impressive 'last stand' film with a couple of things going for it.
","I wanted to love The Mist, I really did and that feeling dawns on you about half way through when you realise it isn't perfect and there are a few niggles but if you're in the right frame of mind and you're going with it, it offers an adrenaline fuelled ride of the horror and of the dramatic. As it turns out, I liked The Mist more than I did love it but it's still the sort of film you can engage with on certain dramatic levels that that hit particularly high notes of both terror, suspense as well as out and out horror. Take the incidence in which it has been established venturing outside is a death-wish and yet certain characters are forced into going out into the mist because of prior events. It's as basic, basic as routine as you like 'don't go there  but they have to' scenario that we've all seen many times before and yet you sit there, watching it and loving every tension filled second of it.<br/><br/>Don't let me make The Mist come across as a guilty pleasure, because it's anything but. In Frank Darabont, the film has an extremely competent filmmaker and one who began his C.V. of most accessible Stephen King adaptations with a character filled drama set in a prison before branching out into another character based drama set in a prison of sorts but incorporating elements of the supernatural. Now he has this: a film that prods the needle a little further into the direction of the supernatural and away from the character study a tad although we don't really mind all that much once everything gets going. The Mist is probably Darabont's weakest King adaptation of the three discussed but again, do not allow it to sound like a criticism.<br/><br/>The film is the sort that the trailers would have spoil for you, indeed I can remember one of those ridiculously fast TV spots popping up prior to its release not so long ago and revealing a little too much; I can only imagine how much a trailer might have given away and consequently spoilt at the time. That said, the intrigue of the mist and what it is and why it's there act as a wonderful back-boiling element to a film gradually establishing characters to whatever degree it sees fit and uneasy relationships others may have had in the past. One such individual in the film is David Drayton (Jane) whose house is partially destroyed by a falling tree that came as a result of a thunderstorm. He finds himself and his son holed up in a convenience store with a bunch of other innocents as odd mist descends, soon gobbling up the store's car park and general area.<br/><br/>The unique selling point of the film is in its ambiguity revolving around the mist. The film is everything from Night of the Living Dead to Deep Rising all the way through to the relatively recent Dog Soldiers in which individuals are trapped within a 'base' and must submit to the film adopting a last stand arc. The difference with The Mist is that rather than zombies or werewolves, the film tears up the piece of paper detailing all known/necessary 'beasties' to lay siege to the setting and gives us a series of wonderful creatures fresh from the mind of Stephen King. To tell anyone what actually comes out of the mist would be both a cruel spoiler but also nigh on impossible to describe which is an achievement in itself.<br/><br/>The Mist actually beds into a nice recent cannon of films detailing everyday people encountering fantastical monsters, following on from Korean film The Host and Cloverfield. I suppose the difference between these and previous films such as Eight Legged Freaks or From Dusk Till Dawn lie in their approach to the post 9/11 situation. Very early on in the shop, the camera flicks and switches and moves in that bizarre, hand held fashion you get when you watch amateur footage shown on news networks that was shot on location soon after a known attack. The feeling you get is distress and panic at the fact you don't know what's going on and neither do the characters. The added kick is as routine as you like: don't show the threat unless absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>The film does not branch off into a realm of politics but that's not to say it doesn't include a fair amount of what it feels is necessary. Early on, an elderly school teacher blames the American government of concentrating too much on building weapons rather than using the money to improve the educational system and the characters connected to the military are presented in a mysterious, ominous and shadowy light. What's additionally eerie is the getting across of a religious individual as the primary source for antagonism within the group, something that starts off as a relative annoyance toward them but escalates to something much larger in an impressive manner. <br/><br/>The Mist is, above most other things, just a cracking good ride. It carries that B-movie feel and that sense of overacting at times but it works for the film when things get rather frightening once encounters with the creatures crop up. Darabont recognises his inspirations early on with several paintings of films-past of this ilk and manages to steer clear of any blatant, unwanted product placement despite the fact the film takes place practically throughout in a convenience store full of goods. The Mist is a frightening at times and dramatic at other times production that keeps you gripped in that way a truly enjoyable horror films can; it isn't up there with the greats such as The Shining and Halloween but it isn't far off."
"sddavis63","9","2","5","8 January 2009"," Taut With Suspense And Very Frightening At Times
","From the opening scenes, ""The Mist"" grabs you and pulls you into a mystery, and the pacing of the story is brilliant, as the mystery is gradually, bit by bit, revealed and explained in a way that ensures that the viewer never loses interest. Throughout, this movie is taut with suspense, and unlike many so-called ""horror"" movies, this one is even pretty frightening at times and it all leads up to a conclusion that is both absolutely shocking and horribly sad, because in the end you know that David (Thomas Jane) did the only thing that he possibly could have done in the circumstances (and it was actually an incredibly noble and heroic act) only to find out that it was absolutely unnecessary, leaving you to wonder how in the world this guy is ever going to be able to survive what has happened.<br/><br/>It isn't necessary to speak at length about the plot here, except to say that this is a pretty fascinating study of how a relatively small group of people react to being forced to confront a horrific situation from which there seems to be no escape. What lengths will they go to? What depths will they fall to? All the characters are interesting to watch. My only real criticism of this movie might be the character of Mrs. Carmody. The performance from Marcia Gay Harden was very good, but it seemed to me to be something characteristic of a handful of Stephen King stories - the addition of unnecessary content that sometimes distracts a bit from the horror of what's happening. I could see value in adding a character who would rally an increasingly uncontrollable mob around them. Why the character had to be a fundamentalist religious nut was beyond me, and she did start to grate on me after a while. Aside from that one point, though, I thought this was an excellent movie, the best horror movie I've seen in a very long time. 9/10"
"rumbleinthejungle","7","2","5","6 January 2009"," Very good adaptation.
","I have just finished the short story so it was fresh in my mind when I watched this film tonight. I must say, I was not disappointed. The short story, if you have not read it, is very good. I have no patience for King's long winded work but his short story collections are brilliant. Check out 'Nightshift' to see what I mean.<br/><br/>The adaptation of 'The Mist' to the big screen does alter things in several ways... but nothing is the worse for it. There is some exposition of the origins of the Mist in the film whereas there isn't anything spelled out in black and white in the book. This is fair enough, as people more often or not complain if they aren't given enough background in a film. I for one don't mind being left in the dark with certain elements of a story if the meat of it is really good. That's just me though.<br/><br/>But.... what is this thing that we are talking about anyway? It's a horror/thriller and in that the film succeeds and then some. Frank Darabont has done his job and done it well. Him being a big fan of King's work has no doubt helped some as the crucial parts of the story (certain lines and imagery) are all included and he brings the story to the screen in a very skillful and loving way. Mrs. Carmody is presented as an attractive, middle-aged women here - not like the stained tooth crone she is in the story. But she's still freaky and you will be rooting for her demise. The much hyped ending is very good. Probably the best thing that the director brings to the table. The creatures are cool. The scene in the pharmacy had me thinking of the part in 'Aliens' where the marines first stumble into the nest. Great stuff. And bravo for the lack of a bombastic soundtrack - nothing ruins the mood more than an intrusive score. The occasional sub bass rumblings and minimalist low organ notes say more than any pompous score ever would.<br/><br/>Check this film out - you won't be disappointed, especially if you dug 'Cloverfield'."

There are lots of horrific, even harrowing scenes, the character development is interesting and the special effects are never less than good.<br/><br/>So I wasn't totally disappointed, but I did feel that the film's downbeat tone spoiled it. Frank Darabont is well known for his adaptations of Stephen King stories, but his two previous films - ""The Shawshank redemption"" and ""The green mile"" - had hope and optimism, despite being tragic.<br/><br/>The mood of ""The mist"" is relentlessly bleak. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, but I'm not revealing anything you won't already know by saying that it isn't a happy one. Yes, it's both clever and ironic, but I agree with some of the previous posters - it feels to me like a cheat. In my opinion, it would have been better left ""open"" - unresolved, as in the novella. <br/><br/>I watch all films hoping for a positive, life-enhancing experience, and Frank Darabont's have given me that so far. I feel a bit let-down and disappointed by the depressing outcome of this one."

","Actually there's nothing out of the ordinary in the way this movie begins, and you think you've got it all figured out right from the start. Then there is twist upon twist - and yet the ending remains shocking! This is something as unusual today as a movie with an important message. Many films claim to have a message of this kind but few of them do. It has something important to say about hope, personal courage and not letting your fear get the better of you. In short: Having a little faith in the future.<br/><br/>For example: David, does not opt to accompany the woman who has left her two children at home alone, something that perhaps we, the audience, would expect our hero to do. Had he done this he may have been able to save his wife as we see in the end when the woman returns with her unharmed children. Mrs Carmody actually shows some courage and resolve (faith) when attacked by one of the giant insects and thus survives without being stung. Amanda Dumfries gradually loses her faith in the fundamentally good in humanity and gives up, despite her natural inclination towards optimism. The irony is blatant in a key scene at the end when David risks his life reaching for the gun that will finally seal his fate and the fate of the ones he is trying to protect. The most dangerous enemy of him and his son turned out in fact to be neither the monsters nor the psychotic sect-people from the supermarket, but he himself.<br/><br/>I never thought I would get this much out of seeing a commercial horror movie, and though I firstly found the ending horribly dark and depressing it later struck me what hidden optimism there is. It says ""give it another go, wait and see"" and, frankly, I think it should be seen by anyone seriously thinking about ""giving up""."

","Well, this movie first scared the guts out of me, then topped it with despair and when I thought it won't get any further it gave me the worst - regret of things that might have been done and haven't been, or things that should not have been done but were nevertheless, done. I was glued to the screen all the same, almost wishing I had the will to scratch myself off and stop watching it, stop it right now, and go have some hot tea or maybe something hotter for my nerves. Especially at the time of night I was watching it. The very fact I'm writing this at the moment (and I got out of bed an turned on the PC to get to IMDb and get some more info on what this all was about) speaks of the effect it had on me.<br/><br/>Despite and in spite, or maybe for the very reason I'm quite out of age horror movies are supposed to be scaring people, I admit I was. Quality make (even though I doubt I'll watch it another time - for the very reason the summary relates of, and I won't look for the book it was made after either. Or maybe I will, but not too soon. Nah, surely I will, first thing tomorrow :D).<br/><br/>Stephen King at his best, and the movie matched it, screenplay, direction, actor work et al. - all in its place, no exaggerations, no heavy stress on computer graphics, and here and there catchy little details, like mark of a blooded hand just by the sign 'out' with an arrow on the glass door. Top notch! <br/><br/>This movie is capable of getting inside one's head and doing things in there - 10 out of 10, from the man not in love with the genre very rarely stopping by the shelf with the label 'horror' on it at all"

","When the lady who had been spewing biblical doomsday quotes and cursing anyone who dared to doubt her piousness or whose piousness she doubted, ever since things went wrong, finally went nuts, was hailed as the prophet because she did, demagogued the crowd, and made human sacrifice to the monsters unknown, I was almost certain that this film was lampooning the intolerance and the ridiculousness of the religious (and political) right and hallowing the rationality and the clear-headedness of the almighty and invincible American (upper) middle-class (especially the sea-board educated liberals).<br/><br/>""Damn."" I thought, ""I should've seen that coming the first moment I saw how that blue-collar, common, vulgar, uneducated, stupid, cowardly, no-good manual labourer even dared to question the judgement of our great hero artist."" Then I continued enjoying the show, not only because Marcia was doing a dead-on satire of the 'politics of fear' but also because I, along with the more enlightened part of the American public, was quite sympathetic to what I, at that moment, thought to be the politics of the director.<br/><br/>Just when I was thinking what an important message that this supposedly 'horror' film was sending and savoring the words of wisdom from our heroes about how blind the 'mass', which, of course, were below our sane, sophisticated, and heroic ones, could get when they were in a panic mode, the ending came.<br/><br/>And bammmmmmmmmm! Everything that you thought you saw unravelled, and reincarnated into a paradox neither could we explain nor did we want to believe. All this time, we thought the ones who were supposed to be the heroes remained as sane as their reason allowed them to be, which no one can say they did not, wrestled with the calamity the most fiercely among their fellow men, which no one can say they did not, and, in every circumstances, made the best guess according to the cards they were dealt, which no one can say they did not either.<br/><br/>Even when the artist pulled the trigger, it was for the best, since they were without supplies or weapons, their car was out of fuel, no aide was in sight, and it was the only other way to die aside from being consumed by the bugs from another dimension. The artist did the noble thing, like a leader should have done, plunging his hands into blood, taking the guilt, and prepared to offering himself to the suffering that others would rather die to avoid. And then, the mist cleared, and the tanks of the military victoriously arrived, along with the lady, who no one thought to be rational to run into the deadly mist alone and was deemed most assuredly dead, and her children, the reason that she so foolishly left the smart.<br/><br/>In the end, the demagogued, the foolish, the stupid, and the insane survived, while the heroic, the reasonable, the rational, the enterprising, and the sophisticated perished.<br/><br/>When the self-deemed superior ones made the comment about the blindness and stupidity about the mass in panic, what they did not know is that they were indeed, as the no-good manual labourer so unknowingly presciently said, not better than the mass. Yes, they did everything they were supposed to do. But they were still in a panic. As they themselves succinctly put, when commented on the stupid mass, - ""You scare people badly enough, you can get 'em to do anything. They'll turn to whoever promises a solution, or whatever."", they, the supposedly intelligent ones, were also scared enough and, thus, could not escape from their truth either. When they were saying ""As a species, we're fundamentally insane."", trying to illuminate their fellowmen's ugly nature to make sense of their inferior behaviours, what they seemed to forget was that they were also part of the species. When they were scornfully watching their kins descending into lunacy, priding in their own 'saneness', what they failed to see is that, in the big picture, they were all the toys of their fear, only with different symptoms. When what you can do is not based on reason but a wild guess, fate rules. It always beats man, who perpetually lives under its whim. And it treats man mercilessly, no better than the bugs man were trying to kill.<br/><br/>Which leads me to think of the wise words of the Great Turtle Master in Kung Fu Panda - ""One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it."".<br/><br/>Which leads me to think of the current financial crisis.<br/><br/>Alan Greenspan, the Maestro, the master of the universe, the wisest of all the finance wise men, whose ass both parties had been so desperately trying to kiss, before he retired with glory, had been adopting an easy monetary policy for years, which increased the money supply, which placed in the hands of the banks so much more money that they were willing to lend to anyone even if they know the person cannot pay back. He aimed for a boom but America got a depression instead. Well, he is just trying to do the obvious, the right thing, predicting the future based on a wild guess, but fate beat him, which he should have known full well that he was no better than any of us when playing a game against fate.<br/><br/>Not to mention W's Iraq fiasco.<br/><br/>They were both trying to do the right thing, the logical thing, yet they both forgot that they belong to the mankind, they are fundamentally insane, and they are scared. This is a lethal combination that guarantees a show-hand with the fate that often beats man. No wonder they both met their destiny.<br/><br/>It simply reminds me again of the Great Turtle Master's wise saying.<br/><br/>And let's just hope the next president of America is, at least, not as scared as those men who would often meet their destiny."

What emotions would you go through. What would you do if you had a child to protect. How would fear affect people in a survival situation. How long would you have faith in hope. This is all about the human. But then thats what monsters are anyway-expressions of our fears. Of our dark side. The ending. They got the ending just right. Right down to the soundtrack after the music has finnished. Its not spoon fed to you.

","I saw the DVD on the shelves here in Europe and I heard a lot of good things about it, so why not?<br/><br/>It was a good decision to bring it along. To be honest, The Mist is not a very original movie. Oh no, it's a monster(s) in the mist, it's killing us, we have to do something etc etc. But, I like the way it has been executed. Sure, you have to deal with some clichés like the crazy religious lady. But, it was one of the stronger points of the movie. It was all very convincing; the way she looks, talks and of course manipulating the other survivors in thinking this is the judgement of God. For me she is one of the highlights. <br/><br/>But, it also shows the weakness of this movie. Although executed well enough, you just know what's gonna happen. Of course, the people in the supermarket are the real monsters instead of the things outside in the Mist. Of course the crazed fanatic will have the majority of the people on her side. And we all know that those guys from the military know more about this terrible disaster. <br/><br/>The ending is splendid though. Gruesome and ironic. Sure, there are are better horror/monsters movies out there which are more original. But looking back at the Mist, it's quite good. Happy I saw it on the shelves."
"Coventry","8","2","5","31 August 2008"," There's something in the mist and it ain't gorillas!
","Whenever writer/director Frank Darabont takes on the repertoire of success-author Stephen King, you can rest assured a good movie will come out of it. Just look at the rating and prestige (especially around this website) of the previous collaborations ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"". But hey, wait a minute, those movies were actual dramas that dealt with human emotions and serious issues like imprisonment, whereas ""The Mist"" is obviously a more straightforward horror flick dealing with miscellaneous types of monsters! Well yeah, this is an entirely different film than the other two, but there still are many similarities as well. Basically you could claim ""The Mist"" is a prison movie just as well, only the setting concerns a supermarket instead of an actual penitentiary, and the menacing eerie monsters on the outside quickly become submissive to the claustrophobia and fear of your fellow man that grows inside the walls of the supermarket. So yes, Frank Darabont delivers a much more brutal and horrific film here, but it nevertheless remains a highly sophisticated and intellectual movie that easily qualifies as one of the most intense and successful genre-accomplishments of the past ten years.<br/><br/>The story opens with the inhabitants of a small town licking their wounds after a severe and destructive storm. Multiple people, among them artist David Drayton with his 5-year-old son and neighbor, intend to quickly go to the local supermarket for extra supplies but they never thought it would become their final trip. Whilst shopping and talking about the storm with fellow townspeople, an ominous and nearly impenetrable mist embraces the supermarket and isolates the building from the rest of the world. Everyone is trapped inside when it turns out the mist is infested with surreal and hideous monsters, like gigantic tentacles, flying reptiles, over-sized bugs with lethal stings and virulent arachnids. Meanwhile, the tension inside grows equally unbearable as David and a handful of others get in conflict with a bunch of religious freaks led by the uncanny Mrs. Carmody. This is possibly the most powerful aspect about ""The Mist"": the increasing suspense within the supermarket and between human beings mutually is at least equally  if not more  disturbing and petrifying as the sequences where a couple of brave souls risk to set foot outside the store and into the unknown. The absolute ""coup-de-grâce"" of Darabont's script comes at the very end, with a climax that is possible the most offbeat, unpleasant, depressing and anti-Hollywood I've ever seen in a reasonably big-budgeted and prominently produced film. Come to think of it, ""The Mist"" rudimentary features everything you could possibly expect from a good horror movie. The opening sequences are straightforward and don't waste any time building up towards the essence of the story, the middle section is genuinely frightening and keeps you guessing what's going on and who the next victim will become, and then finally the ending is an extremely unhappy one that leaves you with a sour taste in your stomach. That doesn't necessarily mean ""The Mist"" is entirely without flaws, of course. There are a couple of sad shortcomings, including the explanation of the bizarre events and the tacky use of CGI-effects. The story eventually reverts to the oldest cliché in the book to clarify the mist's origin (gee, do you think military experiments are involved?) and the film also proves that giant movie-monsters are most menacing when they remain unseen. The gigantic insects and particularly the pink tentacle nearly downgrade the film towards the level of a campy  but nonetheless amusing  80's B-movie.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" definitely also benefices from a talented cast of versatile and devoted actors and actresses. Many of them are friends and regular choices of director Frank Darabont (Jeffrey DeMunn, William Sadler, Laurie Holden) but they all perform splendid jobs. Thomas Jane is excellent as well in the leading role, but undoubtedly the most praise goes out to supportive cast members Marcy Gay Harden and Toby Jones. Harden plays the aforementioned ""leader"" of the continuously expanding group of people who believe the events are a punishment from God. She's truly creepy in her role and you, the viewer, will definitely feel the urge to walk into the screen and eliminate her yourself. Toby Jones is particularly terrific since his character Ollie gradually develops from a measly shop assistant into an unlikely and brave anti-hero. His odd looks and small posture are clashing with his constant calm and sense of rationalism. Jones' performance is a truly impressive one. ""The Mist"" is a great film and a worthy contender for the honoree title of best Stephen King horror adaptation."

","This is one of the best movies made from a King novel. The first 110 minutes is simply excellent. The last five is terrible. They simply had to cut it off. This ending is the worst possible: David and four of his fellows leaves the store and traveling with his car discover that the mist has consumed everything. After a few days (?) they meet a really huge creature and after running out of gas decide to finish their lives. But there's only four bullet for five people. David kills his fellows and gets out of his car to be taken by the creatures. And suddenly the mist starts to dissolve. Then dozens of survivals starts to appear from the road they just left behind and the army shows up as well. And the mist disappears. It is TERRIBLE.<br/><br/>A much better ending could be something like this: David gets out of the car and walks into the mist. And the movie is over. We don't know if he will be taken by the creatures or what happens with the rest of the world. Or an even better one: they have five bullets for the five survivals. We cab hear five shots as David kills the others and finally himself. And that's it. I hope there will be an alternate version with one of these endings."

","The acting is good, the intensity is good. The characters and the relation to them is excellent. The story is very good, and the ending is very original. The biggest downfall, which is very common these days is the bad use of CGI. Where suspense and horror could have been created by ""not showing"" what was in the mist would have been better in parts. For example, where aliens are shown amongst the mist, it is more scary and intense. If it was absolutely necessary to make some aliens completely visible, which i don't believe it was, then they could have used old fashioned creature effects or simply better CGI. The worst was the tentacles scene which made me laugh out loud. It was truly awful. Before that, i took this movie seriously. After it i couldn't help but notice the bad CGI. If that scene had had the guy pulled out into the mist by something unseen it would have been better. I really though progress had been made with CGI, note its excellent use in Transformers, but this really was poor! How can a film be scary with such fake looking monsters like that!! It reminded me of Dreamcatcher, which i thought had an intriguing and gripping storyline until the ridiculously pathetic CGI came into it. Please somebody stop the excessive use of CGI, its ruining our movies more than the excessive releases of identical ROMCOM movie plots"

Everything takes place in a supermarket which is filled with the regular cardboard characters you've seen in every small town setting.

We all know that is an adaptation of the master of horror Stephen King's The Mist' ( which i have not read but for what i have been told, it seems that it ends up very different comparing to the movie, as for the movie ending, Darabont asked King what he thinks about it and apparently King was so enthusiastic about it that he really sustained the idea ) The plot is not an original one. We've seen many movies with people trapped in a warehouse or a grocery store, and we've seen lots kind of bugs attacking them or at least pretending to do so. What really shocked me was the ending. Yeah, the one everybody's talking about. So the ending was like ... why did you have to rush ? Couldn't you wait 10 more minutes ? So i'm giving this an 8 cause it was pretty suspenseful though it kind of lacked of action. It's still worth the money."
"scschell","5","2","5","14 April 2008"," Almost Great
","""The Mist"", based on the novella by Stephen King, has a small group of people holed up inside a supermarket after an all-encompassing impenetrable vapor cloud rolls through the entire town. It doesn't take long before a local man bursts through the doors in a blind panic, blood on his face and clothes and ranting about ""something in the mist"" that dragged his friend away. From there we are led on a moderately-paced ride of suspense as strange and frightening creatures emerge from the fog, the death toll increases and the main characters make a last ditch effort at escape only to meet a fate worse than what awaits them outside the safe confines of the supermarket.<br/><br/>For those that have been reading all the customer reviews (positive and negative alike), the ending has already been spoiled (and had it not been, I would've had no qualms about spoiling it myself  it's THAT BAD).<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I think it speaks for itself. Let me just say that it's like slapping down $40 for a great steakand then getting food poisoning. I did feel pretty sick to my stomach, steak or no steak, after watching the last ten minutes. It's artistic license at its worst.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed to see a talented director like Frank Darabont make a mockery of his previous efforts with an ending designed for maximum shock value. Instead of giving the story the dignity that it deserves (and King actually SANCTIONED this new and horrific twist), Darabont instead has managed to churn out a movie capped by an outrageous denouement that has absolutely no artistic merit. For fans of Darabont's previous work (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile), be forewarned  you will have the distinct urge to turn the other cheek at his future releases. Anyone can shock and/or surprise, but if they do so with proficiency and artistry, they are to be commended. There is nothing commendable about what Darabont has done to rework one of Stephen King's best stories. On paper, ""The Mist"" remains a masterpiece. On film, it is a near disaster.<br/><br/>Having gotten that out of the way, I feel should I point out the movie's strong suits. The first is the design of the creatures that wander through the mist, especially the larger ones. Two giants who make appearances first at a halfway point through the film then the other in the last fifteen minutes are quite a wonder of conceptual design. The screenplay is also good but I do feel that some of the characters are extreme, the religious fanatic in particular played by Marcia Gay Harden. Of course, every good story needs a good antagonist, someone whom the reader constantly wishes would receive their comeuppance. To quote from another of Darabont's films (The Shawshank Redemption), ""His Judgment cometh and that right soon."" Second is the wrenching performance of the film's lead actor Thomas Jane as the film's protagonist David Drayton. Although I hated the ending, I thought Jane gave a commendable portrayal of a man tortured by his decision. Also noteworthy is Nathan Gamble as David's son Billy  his performance was neither trite nor maudlin in the least. Harden is a bit much with her fire-and-brimstone rhetoric as the sanctimonious Mrs. Carmody while the rest of the supporting cast blend in with one another.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the film is excellent up until the last ten minutes. Had a different ending been used and the ""gotcha"" ending (to quote another reviewer) became an alternate ending, I would've been much happier with it and would've even considered adding it to my collection of DVDs at home.<br/><br/>What a shame"

I was really waiting to see this and finally I decided to do it: I was almost trembling remembering that many, many King's books were horribly adapted to cinema (It, The Dreamcatcher, Pet Sematary and many more) but hoping it would come out something good like The Stand or Carrie or Misery!! All was good, following the book quite literary, all the actors (obviously different from what I imagined) were quite good and 'sets' were really 'real'!! Acting was quite good, not exceptional but has no major flaws, and dialogue were not bas as many say! I said: ""Ok, it's a perfect representation of the 'short story'"" but, passing the half of this movie, I began to fear for the ending. I said to myself: ""All is going too good, they will surely be able to ruin this greatness at the end...""!!! and, obviously it happened!!! one of the greatest point of the original 'short story' is the end. Simply. Truly. No other words. When in the final 10 minutes I began to understand I was right: I had to fear for what came in ""moviemakers""' minds... OK for the Pr-final scene (the one in the car) but then... arghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! What happened????????????? what.the.f**k.happens?????? I was left speechless while the credits rolled... what did they do to 'my' finale????? where is the novel left in a gas station, where is the radio transmitting the single word 'hope', where is the sense of abandoning, the 'isolation', the unpredictability of what comes next??? With this finale they were able to make this movie pass from a good post-apocalyptic, dystopia's movie to a simple sad, ""oh my god why did I do that?"" movie... it was frustrating that such a good book/movie was ruined by this inexplicable and meaningless change of finale: if it was good, fantastic, why the hell changing it with a stupid, ordinary one? I give this a 10 until 5 minutes from the end and -2.000 for the end!!!

All of the characters, including the lead, are either one dimensional or stereotypical. The religious zealot is a case example. Children of the Corn anyone? This movie offers nothing other than some cool CGI effects, bad language and a few gross out moments. If you want some real tension and fright, rent Alien or Pitch Black and see how it's supposed to be done.

Most of the movie is in a supermarket and sure enough you'll see around 60-70 people running around like idiots. However this is still entertaining to see as the audience is brought into the film and starts sharing feelings with the characters. You can feel the tension as a group of people find themselves dealing with something unknown, beyond their grasp, and yet still maintain focus and hopefully survive.<br/><br/>More to the point, there were a few scenes that were too long.

"actionfilm-2","4","2","5","30 March 2008"," Big budget Children of the Corn
","The Mist has a great 30 minute intro but then stumbles and falls into Children of the Corn territory. What could have been a suspenseful monster/horror movie becomes a 2 hour exercise in leftist ranting. The Mist makes the same mistake that Tom Cruise' War of the Worlds film did by bogging down the momentum with Tim Robbin's lone unstable character , in the case of The Mist it's a religious lunatic named Mrs. Carmody, whose theology comes from the academy of cult leaders. Since I suspect some viewers (and obviously the filmmakers themselves) believe this to be an accurate and typical portrayal of Christians, since the filmmakers take an extremely serious approach to the story, and since so much time is devoted to this character, I'll offer a few examples to contest this ridiculous stereotype upon which the film has built part of it's real world foundation. For instance, the female David Koresh claims God demands a human sacrifice, to appease him I suppose. Well, here's the problem, the God of the Bible never required human sacrifices period. Remember, God only tested Abraham. Secondly, the gospel describes Jesus as the lamb of God making the ultimate sacrifice once and for all, so that mankind may be saved. By Mrs. Carmody offering up a sacrifice, human or otherwise, it negates the purpose of Jesus having come in the first place.<br/><br/>The Bible that the supermarket psycho so fondly quotes from describes a few of the events leading up to the end times, and if one of them had been a giant bug attack I think odds are it would have rated a mention, yet she comes to this conclusion 60 seconds after the mist appears! A lone biker type tells crackpot Carmody off and is quickly dispatched. Now according to polls, some ninety percent of Americans describe themselves as Christians, so you would think a few of them would be left in the store to point out the rest of the holes in her warped theology. Or maybe we are to assume no one in the store is a Christian since they fail to recognize her rantings as cult minded nonsense, in that case what does this say about the secular part of our society. In any event the small town folk follow like sheep because as we all know, in Hollywood films small town folk are required to be weak minded. The military men in the barricaded store don't fare much better in characterization. They are barely to be found when fortifying the store, much less when the battle begins. Instead we discover the evil military is responsible for this whole mess and rather than stand, fight, and go down swinging in true military fashion they slither away into a dark corner to end their cowardly lives. Only in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Some discussion is given between characters into man's inherent nature as being pretty evil and nasty and in the next breath religion and politics are criticized for their contribution to evil and nastiness. I certainly can't speak to religion and politics in the general sense but as flawed as they are, if the American democratic system and the Judeo Christian religion are responsible for anything its for being a stabilizing force in today's world and also the most charitable anywhere. To suggest we may be better off without them is like offering an anvil to someone whose parachute just failed.<br/><br/>Credit is to be given to performances in this film. I'm sure everyone wishes Andre Braugher had stayed around longer, but in order to stay true to Hollywood film fashion the filmmakers demand that the African American character be among the first to go. Thomas Jane gives a solid performance and is quickly establishing himself as a dependable lead. The rest of the cast perform first rate with what they are given. Creature design is somewhat interesting with the giant Cathula like beast quite effective though little screen time is given to it. The nihilistic ending has received a lot of criticism, but quite frankly, the entire film could be described as such."
"Aaron1375","8","2","5","27 March 2008"," Overcomes rather weak at times looking beasties with a good story about what fear and the unknown can do.
","Yes, this movie has monsters in it...for the most part giant insects. They are, however, the weakest link in this film as they look only a bit better than say a creature from one of the sci-fi channel's original productions. I think they should have used computer generated graphics a bit less, especially when the creatures got a hold of something and this flaw could have been overcome easily enough. That being said, the story and the characters make this one and they make it rather good. I also have to agree with what is said on the DVD box...it does have a rather shocking ending and horrifying too. I hated it, yet I hated it not because it was bad, but because it did what a good horror movie is supposed to do, shock you and make you think about it thereafter. The story, nearly straight from the original short novel by Stephen King. The main differences was that there was not as much setup before the storm or during as there was in the story. That and the ending. Other than that and the military men playing a bit bigger role it is a very by the book movie. There is a storm and a father and son and neighbor go to the store to restock some groceries. However, there is a mist coming and it quickly envelopes the store and makes those inside hesitant to come out as a man runs wildly in the store talking of things in the mist that took someone. Well fear takes over as the father quickly figures out there is something about the mist and a scene of a brave, but foolhardy bag boy proves there is something in the mist. Unfortunately, not all those in the store believe this and even more unfortunately some people in the store believe this is the end of times brought on by an angry God. So paranoia and fear take a hold and general chaos is in the air. Played out very well, but man the ending. I am imagining Stephen King, the master of horror seeing it for the first time and saying ""Damn, that is dark""! Dark, disturbing, and very effective."

","There's something very wrong in ""The Mist"". And I don't mean the weird not scary CGI beasties that pop out exactly as expected to gobble up the supporting cast of Frank Darabont's terrible adaptation of Stephen King's novella. No, I'm referring more to the unsure, sub-B-level acting and unintentional-laugh-filled script.<br/><br/>Too bad none of the characters is remotely...well, a character, let alone believable. About forty minutes into the film (which, at two hours, takes longer to watch than the original novel does to read), right around the time someone trips over the bucket of kerosene, it becomes painfully clear that there's no one to root for in the film. Sadly, Mr. Darabont has a surprise of an ending lined up, but the film doesn't come close to earning it. ""We're in the middle of a disaster"", one character notes midway through the mayhem. This is the one moment in ""The Mist"" that the audience is likely to identify with."
"Superunknovvn","8","2","5","9 March 2008"," ""The Mist"" should have been an instant classic, but it's just a solid monster movie
","Easily one of the most intriguing short stories Stephen King has ever brought to paper, ""The Mist"" was one of the most anticipated King-adaptations in a long time. Longtime fan and friend Frank Darabont was the one who finally got his hands on the project. He had already adapted two King-stories (""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"") to much critical acclaim (justified or not), so fans were pretty hyped up about him working on this beloved material. In hindsight another director might have been a better choice for this movie that is more horror related than ""Shawshank"" or ""Mile"", but we'll get to that later.<br/><br/>Some people have argued that the ""less-is-more""-approach would have been better for this kind of movie, because the less you see of the monsters, the more your imagination can run wild, and the scarier the movie will be. I'm glad that Darabont didn't go for that approach, because that's not what this story is about. Fans of King's ""The Mist"" wanted to see the monsters in all their creepy glory and Darabont really tried to give us that.<br/><br/>The problem is that the CGI is nowhere near as good as it should have been and the movie absolutely depends on convincing special effects. It's not like it couldn't have been done better. ""The Thing"" still looks absolutely stunning and that movie is over 20 years old, so why couldn't ""The Mist"" be as convincing? Thankfully, the monsters do look better once they are surrounded by fog, but the first horrific exposure of giant tentacles is just laughable and even the fog coming over the little town looks cheesy. This flaw really drags the movie down to a point where you can either dismiss it as a failure immediately or decide that some moments are still pretty cool. Either way, the special effects should have been worked on. This way they look half-finished and frustratingly cheap.<br/><br/>The effects are not the only thing that seems cheap. The dialog is also pretty painful to watch at times. The tension in ""The Mist"" arises only partly from the monsters on the outside of that grocery store. The conflicts within the group inside the grocery store are equally important, so it's almost as hurtful that the interaction between the characters seems wooden and clichéd. Although the lines in the script were adopted almost word for word from the original short story, they don't work in the movie. What seems believable on paper doesn't necessarily translate that way to the screen. Darabont may have thought it was the safest bet to include as much as possible from the original short story (an unnecessary sex scene aside), but in this case some adjustments would have been a good thing.<br/><br/>That said, the movie does get a lot better after the first 45 minutes or so. Somehow the longer we stay with that group and the more we watch insanity arise on the outside, the more we get sucked into the story. The characters get more realistic and the creatures are positively creepy. It's a good thing Darabont included all the terrifying stuff from the short story and he did most of it justice.<br/><br/>The much talked about ending isn't all that important to be honest. The story just goes on for a bit longer and ties up some loose ends. Sure, it may not be completely plausible, but it's a better way to end the movie than just going to the credits in the middle of events. The new ending doesn't really fit the mood of the rest of the movie and seems a bit tacked on, but at least it comes as a surprise.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont could have screwed up this great story a lot worse (just thinking of what they did to Bradbury's ""A Sound Of Thunder"" makes me shiver). A bit more style and finesse, a better chosen cast and, most of all, perfected CGI would have been enough to turn ""The Mist"" into the unforgettable classic that it should have been. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. Like the other Stephen King adaptation of 2007 (""1408""), ""The Mist"" can't compete with the short story it is based on, but it's still quite entertaining to watch."
"brennanhm","8","2","5","8 March 2008"," The Mist is an excellent film that speculates on human nature during a supernatural crisis
","As a plume of mysterious Mist from a lake approaches a small town several dozen people find themselves trapped in a grocery store. The last man to enter the store has blood streaming from his nose and claims hysterically that there is ""something in the Mist"". What I liked most about this movie was watching how different people react to a crisis that has no logical explanation. On one hand, you have a group of people who think rationally and refuse to believe something supernatural is occurring even when faced with evidence. On the other hand, you have a fearful group, led by a religious fanatic, who will now believe anything that is preached to them (which I think reflects truthfully on how people, in the real world, can be controlled if enough fear is instilled in them). Watching these groups argue, scream, and fight (sometimes quite violently) with each other is very interesting because it speculates on how people would behave in a frightening and inexplicable situation with no outside communication. This movie reminded me a little of the novel ""Lord of the Flies"" because it portrays how human behavior degenerates when isolated from society. As for the ending, it could be described as shocking, sad, or just plain stupid (possibly laughable). But I, for one, liked it. Mainly because I thought it was atypical and unpredictable. Bottom line: Watch this movie!"
"Boba_Fett1138","9","2","5","18 February 2008"," An original movie that works on many dimensions.
","This movie is being praised basically everywhere, which made me all the more skeptic about watching it of course. I mean, how could a movie set in a supermarket, surrounded by fog, could ever be an exciting or tense horror flick? Well, you better believe it that this movie is a exciting and tense one to watch and it's all being presented in a very original way as well.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie is directed by Frank Darabont should had already given away that this is a great movie. Darabont made the 2 successful Stephen King adaptations ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" prior to this movie. Suddenly I am also less worried about Darabont making a ""Fahrenheit 451"" remake, which is in the works. ""The Mist"" is his third movie based on a Stephen King story and it's the first horror based one. Now, I never have been a too big King for but his story for ""The Mist"" seems like a genuine well written one because it's an horror movie in an unexpected way.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Mist"" such a great and already almost classic movie is because of its approach. What ""The Mist"" does very well is that perhaps the biggest danger and horror doesn't come from outside, in the mist but from inside the people in the supermarket. This movie is a perfect study of human nature and it's not afraid to show the dark side of mankind. It's an highly original and approach of an horror story. Finally a real clever made horror movie, that also makes you think. This however all doesn't mean that the movie also isn't effective on its more generic horror elements, such as scare moments and 'monsters'. Also on that level the movie knows to impress and is it just as effective. <br/><br/>It chooses a realistic approach of things and therefore also picks a realistic visual approach, with sort of hand held looking quick shots and by showing things only from the perspective of the main characters. It throws you right in the middle of things, which of course also really adds to the overall effectiveness and power of the movie. In that regard the movie is also truly original. Because the movie tries to remain as realistic and 'small' as possible, the movie also doesn't a cast with big selling names in it. Because of this, you also don't know who will survive in the end. Normally you know this already when a movie has some big famous names in it. It keeps the characters all more real. It makes the story totally not predictable and far from just another generic piece of horror. The movie also really doesn't end in a generic kind of way.<br/><br/>The movie also features some good looking special effects. Normally special effects and horror are a bad combination but in this case the movie truly benefits from its special effects. There are all, again, featured in a realistic and they are obviously not put into the movie to impress its viewers but to help to tell the movie its story.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is really as good as everyone makes you believe it is!<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"gavrooney","5","2","5","20 January 2008"," truly brilliant but apparently divisive
","The credentials of this movie are fantastic and the more I think about it, as a whole. the more I come to admire it as a breath of fresh air in the horror genre. The pure humanistic nature is brought about brilliantly with dialogue and through acting. The monsters are intriguing, scary, and typical of King's writing. The mist and the directing of the various scenes give great atmosphere and a palpably terrifying experience for those involved.<br/><br/>As far as i can see the only reason this movie hasn't gotten ranked higher overall is because of some people's feelings about the ending. First off I suppose it's a matter of opinion but I think it's a totally honest, brutal and fresh approach to movies. All too often have I seen movies with the same lame endings and I think one of the great merits of this film was its end. I've read comments admitting that the movie was wonderfully made but that the ending was terrible so they gave it 1 or 2 stars. I won't say too much about it but to me, that seems entirely unfair and I think after seeing the movie, most people would agree"
"DICK STEEL","10","2","5","15 January 2008"," A Nutshell Review: The Mist
","With a title like The Mist, you probably won't be faulted if the first thing in your mind is that it's one of those run of the mill horror movies, like The Fog and The Haze (ok, so I made the last one up, it's actually a recently made short film competing in Berlin). And the trailers do suggest strange shenanigans happening inside a mist shrouded town, so in the hands of any mediocre storyteller, it's so easy to make them go Boo. Based on the novella by Stephen King, The Mist turned out to be unexpectedly excellent, with audiences whooping for joy both at the right and wrong places.<br/><br/>Granted, sometimes Stephen King's materials do make uninteresting movies when adapted incorrectly and helmed dubiously, but Frank Darabont has proved himself with his previous King works like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, both good movies in their own right, with excellent casting. Here, a cast of mostly unknowns carry the movie, and the direction doesn't rely on gimmicky tricks to frighten you, but in its measured, calm and at times standard by-the-book style, it brings heightened tension every step of the way.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane, whose last movie I saw was The Punisher, stars as David Drayton, a comic artist whose house was smashed in one night by a tree during a bad storm. The next morning, he leaves his wife, and bringing his child and neighbour, they journey to the local supermarket to get supplies for home repairs, but not before realizing the army whizzing away at top speed. The pace picks up and within 10 minutes, the shoppers in the supermarket find themselves locked in as a mist descends upon them, with a frantic man running back to warn everyone that there's something within the mist.<br/><br/>If we're talking about a cliché story, you'll probably get wave after wave of attacks on the shoppers inside the supermarket, as they barricade themselves in for a fight for survival. However, all that turn out to be secondary, as the story becomes clear that it's not about it being a horror movie, but a social mouthpiece about a couple of topics, all of which centres upon fear, and holding a mirror unto ourselves. We are afraid of the unknown, and chances are it will lead us to make irrational decisions, sometimes firing from the hip. The movie will constantly probe you into questioning how you would respond to the given situation, whether you'll break under pressure, or be able to maintain a sane mind in formulating survival plans.<br/><br/>And in the unknown, there would bound to be a Bible-thumper. Truth be told, I thought that the character Mrs Carmody (sounds like ""comedy"", played by Marcia Gay Harden) will be one that the censors here might be touchy with, given how she was portrayed in extremely negative light. In times like these where there's a huge question mark hanging over you, there will be those who turn to religion for answers, and sometimes they may drift into the fanatical zone on the words of false prophets. Then I realize that this of course could be left as a warning against extremism, that it doesn't, most of the time, solve problems, but create them, and in the false name of god, makes it easier to do so too, in persuading others to join in the lost cause.<br/><br/>Naturally, the preservation of self also takes centerstage, and does so very early, almost from the start - how we think of others having ulterior motives against ourselves, and just how much would we contribute for the greater good, or toward fellow friends and acquaintances. And this rams itself in with a key ironic scene, that sometimes, on positive karma, you may be rewarded for the good things you've done for others. There was a tinge of sadness, pity and sense of woe in the ending, and I enjoyed every minute of it, even though you may have guessed how it would turn out to be. As a friend put it, neither of us expected Frank Darabont/Stephen King to have the brass balls they had to pull it off, but it just had to be to evoke those emotions, making it all the more powerful, and wretched, at the same time.<br/><br/>Despite it being devoid of a soundtrack until the final moments, I thought it was highly effective in not having one, letting ambient noise play a primary role. It allowed all our senses to be focused on how things were developing during the movie, without having music to emotionally manipulate our thought process and opinions. There are moments that you had to judge, without being biased by any particular soundtrack playing over the background. But fret not, interspersed nicely between scenes of questioning, are the scenes of the usual action-adventure that you'll come to enjoy, often times squealing together with the characters (and depending on the audience, them too) as the unfortunate faceless/characterless few start to succumb to the out of the world creatures.<br/><br/>We've waited for a long time for The Mist to descend upon our shores, and now that it finally did (almost, at a GV Surprise Screening), it didn't disappoint a bit, but surpassed all expectations. Highly recommended."

","In an absolutely astounding year at the theaters with some incredible 9 outta 10's and 10 outta tens out there it's great to still see some incredible movies coming during the typically slow time. Even if they aren't cleaning up at the box office they shouldn't be ignored. I had really high expectations for this film adaptation of one of my favorite Stephen King novellas. I suppose that if anyone could do the story justice director and writer Frank Darabont would be able to do it having previously adapted two very successful King films. It has been some time, more than a year or two since reading the short story so I had the benefit of not being overly influenced by the book. The Mist was shocking, twisted, depraved, haunting, beautifully filmed and one of the best action drama, sci-fi horrors of the year hands down with some truly incredible special effects the likes which haven't impressed me this much since my first viewing of Jurassic Park. The acting was spot on even if it was almost campy and overdone it just fit the film. This was Stephen King movie-dom at it's very best. The eerie isolation, the small town, the close knit neighbors and the religious fanaticism. And the fact that Darabont wrote a completely new ending that is downright disturbing and twisted and even King himself heralded as terrific makes it all the more worthwhile.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane (who I have always thought has an amazing performance in him) does a terrific job as the rugged alpha male hero of The Mist. He is the perfect Stephen King leading man...flawed but yet perfectly heroic in every way. Jane commands the screen and his performance draws you in to the very last moment. In a perfect world he would deserve an Oscar Nomination (even though it'll never happen.) When I first saw Marcia Gay Harden stumble onto screen in a very vivid and lively religiously fanatical performance I thought 'Oh man, she is overdoing it a lot' but then as the story unfolded and her character came out more I realized that this was Mrs. Carmody, her character. Overdone, fanatical, loud, sanctimonious and dangerous. It turns out Harden gives on hell of a performance and may indeed deservingly so get an Oscar nomination because she is the perfect anti-villain and is amazing. She is the perfect 'in-the-flesh' adversary for Jane's David Drayton. Laurie Holden is also very good as the female heroine. She's strong and gutsy and still looks good and plays her part very well. To me these were the stand out performances and I wish I could go through each person because there were some really terrific supporting cast members including Jeffrey DeMunn, Toby Jones, and more. If anything The Mist is a sure fire nomination for Best Ensemble Cast.<br/><br/>There isn't a single moment of lag in this film which clocks in at a deliciously perfect 2 1/2 hours and doesn't try to cut anything out to save time. Just when you think the climax must be over the ending completely blows you away as the desperately try to flee The Mist. In one of the most stunning displays of special effects and jaw dropping movie moments you get to see the Beast that lies in the mist and it is AMAZING!! The film moves at break neck speed and I haven't found myself whispering at the screen this much in a long time 'Look Out' 'Oh my gosh' and so forth. This is just a truly breath taking film and unfortunately it won't likely get it's just rewards or even make a lot of money but I have to encourage any King fans, Horror/Sci-fi fans or just anyone looking for a truly great film experience...you must see this. It's one of the best this year hands down and period. 10/10"

What if fear demands a solution better than compassion and love? <br/><br/>The Mist gets under your skin and makes you wonder the choices you would make in a life or death situation.

In my decade on IMDb, I have only rated five films with a 1/10, a list of the worst films of said decade, indeed, some of the worst films I have ever seen. Well, make that six films. The Mist is an intensely stupid and insipid film. It's fan rating of 7.9, at the time of this writing, speaks only to American stupidity. In short, the screenplay was more humorous than frightening, but humorous in a sad, pathetic way. The characters in the film were also jocular, acting (as do characters in just about every horror film) in ridiculous, pitiful ways to their circumstances. The only redeeming moment in the entire film is when the moronic Ms. Carmody was finally dispatched, all too late. In short, unless the holiday season vomits out another truly idiotic effort, The Mist will easily rank (literally) as the worst film of the year. 1/10, avoid this movie like the plague, it's two hours of your life you will never get back."

","3/10 is a little harsh, and mostly reflects the chasm between my expectations of this movie and the end result. A horror movie - a *Stephen King* horror movie - with a 7.5 on the IMDb? I had high hopes. Talk about a disappointment.<br/><br/>I read this short story about 10 years ago, when I was a kid, and I loved it. I don't know if I had low standards back then, or if this movie fell horribly short, but something was very wrong here. You should never be watching a movie and thinking of the protagonist ""hurry up and die or something so I can get out of here"".<br/><br/>There's two things to compare to when judging this movie -> other movies, and other Stephen King movies (they are two very different entities).<br/><br/>Special effects and acting -> maybe a 5/10 for a normal movie, 9/10 when comparing to other Stephen King movies (I've seen them all). No complaints here.<br/><br/>Scariness -> 7/10 compared to other movies, 5/10 compared to other King movies (judging from what people I was with said. 0/10 in my opinion, but I never think movies are scary)<br/><br/>Directing -> 3/10, 3/10. The camera jerks around quite a bit, and zooms in quickly on action, it gives the movie an amateur homemade feel - the kind that worked well, in, say, Cloverfield - that is very out of place when used here.<br/><br/>Character Development -> 5/10, 5/10, pretty much non existent, characters are painfully one dimensional -> there's the crazy religious lady, the hero father, the scared kid, the black guy, the dumb maintenance guys, ... well it goes on, the point is everyone can be summed up in about 3 words.<br/><br/>Dialog -> 5/10, 5/10, very poor, seems like lines were maybe cut out of various tabloids? Taken from reality TV? I don't know. Wouldn't have been a big deal, except for when the 1-D characters are trying to have an important philosophical discussion about the goodness of man, you just can't help but roll your eyes.<br/><br/>Writing Fails -> Normally, I wouldn't say any of this warrants a bad review, especially in a horror movie (who needs character development?) The problem is that the writer had a choice -> focus on the action, or focus on the psychological aspects. There's nothing wrong with either choice, but you need to be able to back it up -> if you want to focus on the psychology of the characters (as the movie did), you need some character development and intelligent dialog, and the movie had neither. A debate about philosophy? The meaning of religion? They ruin the movie, they are about as home here as they would be on MTV. Everything seems painfully trite, pretentious, and out of place.<br/><br/>Directing Fails -> I don't think it's fair to compare a movie to a book, they are two vastly different mediums, but this situation really calls for it -> the book had this sort of ""creeping doom"" feel to it, the story moved slowly along, very slowly building the horror, until it was on top of you, surrounding you (do I need to say this is analogous to the mist itself?) The movie just sort of drops you into the mist, leaving you wondering ""how did I get here?"" and ""why should I care?""<br/><br/>Movie Fails -> Clichéd drivel.<br/><br/>Again acknowledging that it's not fair to compare this to the original story, the fact remains that I think you would enjoy reading (or re-reading) the story far more than watching this piece of junk (and the story's about 100 pages, it should take you about the same amount of time)"
"Maciste_Brother","1","3","10","2 November 2008"," The Birds + Lord of the Flies + The Giant Claw = The Mist
","I won't beat around the bush here, THE MIST is a terrible film, terrible on EVERY level. The fact that this was released on the big screen in 2007 is a testament on how Hollywood doesn't know how to make good movies anymore.<br/><br/>What's bad about THE MIST?<br/><br/>Bad story. We've seen this storyline a million times already: people stranded in a single setting with something evil out there terrorizing them. THE BIRDS is a classic example. Other examples include stuff from Stephen King himself. Remember THE LANGOLIERS or MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE? Then again, maybe one shouldn't. The characters try to cope with the menacing threat outside while dealing with their own demons between themselves. How profound. The characters behave ONLY in clichéd or boneheaded ways which sets off a continuous stream of forced confrontations and suddenly the film felt like an adult version of LORD OF THE FLIES, with people splitting into two camps and one trying to control the other.<br/><br/>Bad special effects. I've seen more convincing FX on MIGHTY MORPHING POWER RANGERS. If you're going to make a movie about scary creatures you better make sure those creatures are convincing. None of the CGI monsters were convincing. The whole thing reminded me of THE GIANT CLAW, with the cast in that movie acting with straight faces even though the monster was basically a silly Muppet. Here, the effects looked rushed and ill-defined and yet everyone was crying, dying, fighting, praying over these funny CGI monsters. The end result is not a very effective drama but more of an unintentional comedy, such as THE GIANT CLAW.<br/><br/>Bad editing and lighting. The lighting was so bad. In many scenes, actors are seen carrying flashlights or candles to illuminate their surrounding even though everything around them is clearly visible to us. And for a big budgeted movie, the editing was sloppy. It's almost as if they didn't give a damn. <br/><br/>But worst of all is the acting. The acting from everyone was woeful, with Thomas Jane being the worst. Jane, who started his career in beefcake roles, is no actor and this film shows it in spades. The acting from everyone is so embarrassing that I wondered if Ed Wood directed this movie.<br/><br/>The controversial ending is equally laughable with the army coming to save the day from these inter-dimensional creatures, with just tanks and flamethrowers. That's it? I mean, even Japanese monster movies made 40 years ago were more creative than this.<br/><br/>The title for this film shouldn't be THE MIST but THE MISS."

","Bad filming (trying to make it look documentary with non-steadycam shooting, and daft angles)this story (unusual for king, whose style usually is a fair lead-in to a disappointing ""well, i had no idea how they could win so the monster left"" ending - and in the book they are just driving away with no conclusion: in this Frank Darabont installs an ironic {although telegraphed} ending) Maybe it does owe much to Carpenter's Fog; but the producers would have been wiser to spend the money ( a fraction of it) of an adaptation of James Herbert's Fog instead. What with the poor meta-narrative, the poor acting, the inconsistency of plot (they all stay in the supermarket for safety, then they seem to forget the threat when they need to unblock a vent! And they see the insectoids are attracted to the little lights in the window, so they turn them off and light floodlights! The main character predicts what will happen with the fire-and-brimstone-cliché preacher nutter, yet is surprised when it does happen! and they leave the supermarket with hand held lights; immediately after the bug attack!!{yet when they drive, the car is illuminated like Vegas, and not one bug comes to them then!} duh!!) and the amount of actors with incomprehensible lisps: this film is a dire and painful waste of time.

In classical Stephen King style, extraordinary things happen and are not explained or worse: the explanation is ""...cuz..."". The clichés in this movie are horrible: aggressive lawyer, smart ass city man, cute crying kid, sweet motherly teacher, nerdy grocery store clerk, hysterical religious nut.<br/><br/>Spoilers (not that there's any fun to be spoiled...) The story does not make any sense. Monsters appear, they are strong but they can't break through plate glass windows. The monsters are invincible and numerous, but the army just shows up and solves everything in 5 minutes. Monsters appear out of nowhere, but they think of cutting down phone lines. The whole preacher thing is an insult to religious people (and, being an atheist, I have no sympathy but this is way too much). The first monster is a cheap rip-off of several low-budget movies of the 80's.<br/><br/>The ending will go down in history as one of the dumbest cheap shot I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I could try to rate this movie on my crap-meter but the needle is stuck in the red."

The movie itself was OK, kind of a classic movie done in a modern setting, the acting was pretty good as well. But the ending simply was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Frank Darabont had 2 good movies in his career, this was a sad attempt at a 3rd, all because of the ending. If you really want to know why it's such a horrible ending.

The actors are all believable. Marcia Gay Hayden is wonderful in that role. I never liked Jane but he proved me wrong as he was totally convincing acting his part.

Uh oh, what's this, this movie even throws in the ""crazy nutter religious lady"" that nobody would listen to even if somebody paid them. It should also be known that The Mist follows the other rules of todays horror films such as making the characters completely unlikable as well as unmemorable.

","I really enjoyed this movie! I would have enjoyed it more had I not been sitting next to a handful of immature viewers who laughed at inappropriate times (like when a person dies...I'm thinking 'would they laugh like that if it was a real life situation!?') So, their inability to take seriously the human nature elements of this film, instead laughing at them, kind of threw a wet blanket on an otherwise great experience.<br/><br/>All that aside, I loved how the mist kind of did what the ocean did in 'Jaws'. Like in Jaws, you never knew what exactly was out there or where and when it would strike. I loved that about it. It plays on your imagination.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS <br/><br/>The ending really reminded me of a 'Twilight Zone' episode where your heart just breaks for the main character...like the one where all this man wants to do is read, then something happens and he is left all alone on earth with all the books, and then his glasses break...its that kind of ""Oh man that is so terrible for that guy"" kind of ending.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't really care for was the Mrs. Carmoda subplot. At first I thought it was Hollywood's latest attempt to trash the image of Christians. But after watching the movie I realized that most people will see that character as an inaccurate representation of what a Christian (if they are legitimate) should act like. Yes, there are some Christians out there who act like her and make the legitimate ones look bad, but I think people know this and won't think much of her tirade.<br/><br/>In all, great King movie, like Shawshank.

Go see it just for her if nothing else. It was great fun to actually be at the movies where the audience reacts and rolls with the punches for a change. I recommend finding the loudest, most crowded theatre available. There were a few monster movie clichés and stereotypes, some undeveloped threads and a few dumb actions by the characters, but great fun overall.

Basically, all attitudes of the dozen or so main characters are completely extreme (or cliché) and their respective behaviors too rash to the point of stupidity. Their only purpose is to create the series of complications in the movie. there is nothing to invest in them, and I had real trouble worrying about any character. I felt like cheering against them, save the Draytons. Also, while the main conflict between characters is intense, I felt that it simply became tiring rather than suspenseful. Lastly, I didn't find the ending inspired or thought-provoking. In fact, I anticipated the ending and felt no ""twist"" or irony, which I suspect was the ultimate goal.

","This one just happens to be based on my all-time favorite Stephen King story, and it doesn't disappoint. (Well, there IS one moment early in the movie- the scene where Thomas Jane as the hero is trying to hang onto a stock boy who's being pulled through the loading dock door by a tentacled monster- where Jane's plea for help is oddly flat, without any sense of urgency, but that one small moment- pivotal though it may be- can be overlooked when one sums up the totality of the movie.) Having spent far too many lonely nights stocking shelves in supermarkets (and watching rats in the stock rooms nibble and urinate on bags of rice), I found the setting inspired. (I felt the same way, having worked in warehouses most of my life, when I read GRAVEYARD SHIFT.) The cgi actually make sense in THE MIST: Practical Effects might not have been as convincing, as insects tend to move very quickly, although the preponderance of mist and darkness would've lent themselves very well to Practical Effects. One of my favorite lines comes after the biker-type has been torn in half and Marcia Harden as a bible-spouting religious fanatic begins to cause some un-needed trouble. Says Jane: ""I'd like to leave before people start drinking the Kool-Aid."" This is exactly what I'd intended to do in a year-long serial story I submitted to a local paper- to be titled THE STORM-, but the story wasn't selected. The pharmacy run is fast-paced and effective, with almost non-stop action, but it's the subsequent scene, wherein we learn that the military had discovered a ""view"" into ""another dimension"" (called ""The Arrowhead Project"") that's the cause of all the trouble, that things start to come to a boil. This sets up the stunning ending, which has to be one of the greatest twist endings in the history of Horror Movies. THE MIST has it all. Highly recommended."

","If I were to rate my favorite Stephen King movies it would be 1.) The Green Mile (yes The Green Mile is first, it's my list). 2.) Shawshank Redemption. 3.) Misery. After these three it would be The Shining, Carrie, Dolores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Cujo and The Mist in no particular order (although I might rank The Shining above the rest). All this is to illustrate how highly I think of the movie The Mist.<br/><br/>The Mist took place in a rural Northeast town, like so many Stephen King movies do. The town was hit by a vicious storm. Shortly following the storm came a mist and the mist brought some creatures that no one was ready for. The movie follows a group of townsfolk of about 40 or 50 that hunkered down in a supermarket to avoid the mist and its wrath. The people in the supermarket splintered into groups. The most vociferous and eventually the strongest group was the religious group led by Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden).<br/><br/>This movie was about nether-worldly creatures but at times that took a back seat to the drama in the supermarket. There were some stomach turning moments, some hair raising moments, some angering moments and somber moments. But the real standout part of this movie was the religious aspect. As death and destruction is being wrought upon them and Mrs. Carmody continues proselytizing-her numbers grow and so does the mania. No doubt, viewers were divided into two distinct groups. Group no. 1: ""Oh yeah, that's what religion and those religious nuts are all about. They're all cults."" Group no. 2: ""OMG! Another religious nut hijacking a religion and making a cult."" Whichever group you belonged to you were still compelled by the drama of it all. Marcia Gay Harden did a spectacular job and proved why she was an Academy award winner in 2000.<br/><br/>The Mist kept me intrigued the entire movie. The movie was well directed and well written. The CGI wasn't great but it was above average. The movie was only enhanced by an ending you must see. The end, for me, propelled the movie from a 6 or 7 rating to an 8."

","The Mist, based on Stephen King's The Mist, is a science fiction horror film. It is about a thick swirly mist that envelopes the town of Bridgeton, Maine. The people in the local grocery store get stranded as monster creatures prowl through the outside mist, looking for prey. The story brings out desperate events as a result of what one can do in extreme circumstances.<br/><br/>The Mist, cast in 2007 is directed and written by Frank Darabont. Frank Darabont had also worked on Stephen King's Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption. Cast featured on The Mist are Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Samuel Witwer, Toby Jones, Nathan Gamble, Andre Braugher, Frances Sternhagen, Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn and Melissa McBride.<br/><br/>The Mist puts more of a take on the characters portrayed in the movie rather than the sci fi monsters. Desperation, impatience and fear can all lead to a deadly combination. This thriller will keep you guessing the whole time.<br/><br/>Why do I say that this would be an ideal vacation? Because in my opinion, if aliens attacked the earth and covered it in a thick mist, I'd probably take a day off to relax. Oh, by the way - pay attention to the cast, many of them end up appearing and even starring in The Walking Dead."

","I am not one to usually write reviews, but I had to on this movie. Book adaptations scare me, as most directors and writers are not quite able to capture the spirit the book held. I think that is why this movie is something different to me.<br/><br/>First off, this is not a movie that requires a lot of back story, you are taking a journey with the characters, and you develop bonds with them feeling like you are there watching over their shoulder, almost as a character yourself.<br/><br/>The acting... the acting is above reproach. Not going to give anything away, but I can't find a single actor who did a sub-par performance. Marcia Gay Harden and Sam Witwer are two actors whose performances truly stood out to me, and of course you have the Walking Dead's Laurie Holden, Melissa McBride and Jeffery DeMunn working side by side with the Punisher's Thomas Jane.<br/><br/>And, of course, without revealing anything, the ending. The infamous ending. I love the ending in how it compliments the feeling of the story, but I can't watch it. It is so well done, and so wonderful in how it brings a finality to the story, but I always stop the movie right before. That being said, it is most worth watching, quite simply for the pure brilliance of it.<br/><br/>This movie tests boundaries, and pushes limits and is most definitely worth a viewing.<br/><br/>""As a species we're fundamentally insane.

","""The Mist (2007)"" is most definitely a Stephen King story. It on the forefront is a horror tale of monsters coming from some unknown rift in time and space to inhabit our world. However underneath the horror lie incredibly rich characters, engaging dialogue, interesting set pieces, and above all else a deeper meaning.<br/><br/>This is a dramatization of humanity that breaks down society into some rather broad stroke characters who are pitted against each other in the same way we find it necessary to segregate and attack all those who do not agree with our group mindset.<br/><br/>The controversial ending of the film tells us in a very provocative way to not give up on the human race because no matter how difficult things may become we will persevere and make it through. David Drayton gave up on everything he held dear and as a result lost everything.<br/><br/>The Mist may not be for everyone, it is a fairly intelligent movie which most people seem interested in avoiding when it comes to the horror genre but if given a chance and time to reflect upon its many layers I have absolutely no reservation in your most thorough enjoyment."

","I wasn't impressed after reading the summary and watching the trailer of The Mist. I'm not a fan of King and find any post-The Shining movie quite bad. However, because of the high score here, I decided to give it a try. Once again, a piece of rubbish receives inexplicable praise. This movie is terrible. It got the exact same elements you will find in any other modern King adaptation (weird creatures, the military and some hysterical people). Now, I understand that The Mist tries very hard to create antagonists and individuals normal people can relate to by boosting stereotypical personalities to the extreme, but this is ridiculous. I don't need to watch a religious fanatic portrayed like that, I already want them to stay well away from me without the need to go through a piece of thrash like this one. I also don't need this film to torture me with idiotic human behaviour because I can already see it by having a look through the window. Alright, The Mist have a couple of OK moments. That doesn't save it. I'm fed up with these movies showing the same things, the emotional (and shallow) stuff and the good guy who has to go through great sacrifices due to his do-gooder nature. Seriously, a slight change in the monsters doesn't make for a new film every year Mr King."

I made a special trip to the store to buy this ""scary"" movie. I didn't read King's book, but I read the jacket for this movie. And I bothered to log in after watching this movie to tell you that the film adaptation is not even close to what is claimed on the jacket: masterpiece, scariest movie of all time, thriller. That would be a big ""No"", ""No"", and ""No"". Stephen King wrote in ""On Writing"" that even when you are writing fiction you still have to write the truth-- Oh my god; this story come up short on King's aphorism. Whether it was the novel or the screenplay, I don't know (because be sure I will not read the book after sitting through this ridiculous movie)but I will tell you that in this miserable piece of fiction the truth was overlooked again and again and again. In simple terms, the thriller portion was dulled away by literally in-credible scenes and situations. This so-called thriller horror movie was a giggle fest of silliness.

It started out OK and I liked the cast but it very quickly descended into farce. For a start the things in the mist were pretty unconvincing and as soon as I saw them I knew the film wouldn't scare me. The reason for the mist was glossed over in a matter of seconds with a really unconvincing and pathetic explanation. Finally the ending was one of the cruelest things I have ever seen in a film. It was totally unnecessary, I would rather have seen them get eaten than that. I really wanted to like this film as I feel Frank Darabont is a huge talent but he fell short this time.

There were also a few times were it would look like the movie was setting up an interesting plot for certain characters only to kill them off 2 minutes later which to me was very aggravating.<br/><br/>If the ending had been different I still would have said a 6 or 7 out of 10.

","Arriving in the UK a considerable number of months after it appeared in the States, this is the third adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King story (the previous two being The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile). Darabont clearly has an affinity for King, because his three films are all not only faithful to their source material, they are also excellent films (which contrasts strongly with the many, many very poor adaptations of King's material).<br/><br/>The Mist tells of a group of people trapped in a supermarket by a mist which has suddenly arrived from nowhere - or, more precisely, by the savage and bloodthirsty things which lurk, tantalisingly out of sight, within the mist. It is a simple, claustrophobic tale of suspense and uncertainty, one of the main features of which is that among the group of people taking refuge is one who is every bit as big a monster as those things lurking unseen outside (played wonderfully by Marcia Gay Harden).<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is the nominal hero (or, perhaps ""everyman"" is better in this case), a poster artist who, to my delight, is painting a poster as the film opens showing Clint Eastwood as The Dark Tower's Roland (a quick plug for King's Dark Tower books here!). Just as much a hero is the unlikely Toby Jones in a terrific, but no doubt undersung performance.<br/><br/>The monsters here are downright nasty, very well realised, and wholly convincing.<br/><br/>King's novella ended on a note of uncertainty. Darabont reaches that point and takes us further forward, leading to one of the bleakest endings I can recall in a mainstream movie.<br/><br/>This film works on all levels - horror, suspense thriller, slashfest, character study, social commentary. Well worth a couple of hours of your time if you don't mind gore and scares."

","I saw this movie twice when it was in the theaters, and now can't wait for the DVD to be released. I waited over two decades for King's story The Mist to be filmed. I read the story often, usually during heat waves in summer. It had the easy, vivid writing style of books like Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby, and not as dense as some of King's other books. When I heard a movie version had finally been made, I feared it would be turned into a parody, filled with a teenage cast. Well, I was amazed at the production. It's an old fashioned monster movie made for adults. It captured the story quite well, although the ending was a double shock, and better than the novella's ending. I don't understand why so many Christians seem upset. The Mrs. Carmody character never mentions Jesus or even the Bible! She's more like a demented new-age mystic. I think the Christians are unduly paranoid. ""Imps from hell! Pallid horrors!"" Indeed! This movie is just a well done monster movie about an absurd series of events and how people might realistically react to them. Fun and scary!"

The Mist doesn't carry the same... overall feeling at the end that the other two movies did, but it is definitely worth watching. The only problem that I found with the movie is the ending which is controversial. There are many people who like it, and many people who didn't.

","The basic plot of the film is that there are monsters on the loose trying to kill everyone. However, there is so much more to this film. The deeper meaning of the film is fear.<br/><br/>This film is very allegorical. I would argue that the grocery store and the town are a microcosm of America. The monsters represent terrorists. Mrs. Carmody represents conservative republican fundamentalist Christians. David Drayton represents the liberal Hollywood elite. The conflict between Mrs. Carmody's group and David Drayton's group represents the divide in America between the red states and blue states. Mrs. Carmody tries to sacrifice David Drayton's son. This represents young soldiers being ""sacrificed"" for the war on terror. The symbolism in this film goes on....<br/><br/>The actors are excellent and unknown to most people. This helps the viewers lose themselves in the film. People will either love or hate the ending. I like the ending because I think it is in keeping with the film's message of what fear can do to people. I also think it symbolizes how America may destroy itself with fear. As President Roosevelt stated, ""The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself."""

","This was a good sci-fi flick that had some pretty decent startles to it. The plot development was good and the relationship evolution of the 'stranded' town folk was a typical example of the ""Lord of the Flies"" syndrome. Parts of it are a bit slow but these parts are punctuated by scary jolts. I was intrigued by the premise, as it came to light, particularly because of what I've been reading about 'String Theory' as well as 'Dark Matter' at Wikipedia. Some aspects of the film kind of reminded me of ""Eight Legged Freaks"". If you have a phobia about bugs you might want to pass on this one. The acting was passable and the ending had a nice twist to it. I don't know that it was worth the $8.50 I paid to see it in the theater, but I definitely RECOMMEND it as a DVD rental, or wait 'till it comes to the budget theater."

But, that not withstanding, this is one compelling piece of film. <br/><br/>It teaches many lessons, should the movie-goer care to hear; lessons like: Don't cling to dogmatic prattlings out of desperation, Don't allow your government to conduct experiments that we, the people, are not aware of (it's OUR MONEY!), Don't go through life believing that friends are failed enemies, and Don't give up without a fight...we will endure if only we demonstrate positive resolve. This film demonstrates just what happens when we possess a firm dose of negative resolve. EEE GADS! <br/><br/>All in all? This was dark, and wonderful. It runs a bit like Storm of the Century and Maximum Overdrive in the scenario, but does NOT end like either. This ending is fantastic. It shows us what Stephen King adaptations SHOULD be...and CAN be, with the right director and dramaturgist. This is suitable for Friday/Saturday night viewing, but NOT for the kiddies!

But after I saw the movie especially the ending, I'm glad I did not because I would have known how it ended. Even thougth I had an idea on how it would end, I was not 100% certain. At first when I saw the first monster attach the bag boy and I saw the special effect, I thought Oh no, not another bad Dreamcatcher bad special effects alien. But then when I saw the face on those mosquito and spiders, I was like cool!!! I loved this movie. I thought it was great. Yes one would say it had a lot of drag with all the talking, and yes maybe that's true, but still, the line in the movie was true, it shows how people react when put in that situation, when put in a position of having to decide ""what should I do?"", a situation of fear. I was so hopeful when they got in the car and tried to get out of the mist. I so wanted them to see clear land. That is what was so shocking to me, I was expecting them be free from the mist. I was shocked that the old man and women want to kill themselves. I could not believe that the father would kill his own son who he is suppose to protect against anything. How dare he end it. How dare he not try. But yes I would suppose that once they saw that huge creature at the end that that would have seem like that was it... that was the end of the world. But to think that in the end, if he just would have waited one more day, or stayed at the mall the 4 would have lived. But no, now the people in the mall are going to live. Can you believe that? The women who left the store early on and the people in the store are going to live and the man with his son, the women, and the 2 old couple who fought for their lives died. That is not fair. I think that father is not going to live that long anyway. I'm sure the grief of killing them will cause him to take his own life. If he just would have waited!!! As I left the movie I was depressed. But yet still amazed that King had the mind to still think of all these ideas. That is why he is great. I loved the praying mantis."

","I always enjoy movie versions of Stephen King's books, and Frank Darabont has already proved with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile that he is the man when it comes to adapting Mr King's stories to the screen. He completes his hat-trick with this great movie of what some might believe to be one of King's lesser works. Everything is spot-on from direction through to the excellent committed acting performances of a well-cast group of actors, which only leaves to beg the question: why, oh why, when he decided on which ending to choose did this one not remain for a DVD alternative ending? *********SPOILER ALERT**************SPOILER ALERT********************* After all that the characters had been through, and after all they had seen, I thought they might have deserved a little more than a bullet through the head as soon as the car ran out of gas. This action did not even make logical sense. Drayton had reserved the bullets for the last possible resort when all other hope was lost, but the car coming to a standstill surely did not mean the loss of all hope. If the monsters of the mist had been approaching the car from all angles and were starting to break through the windows, then yes, fire away. But not at the first opportunity just because the car stopped, because who knows, if they'd just sat tight for a couple of hours, or even a day, maybe the mist might have begun to clear, or maybe the army might have turned up in tanks to rescue them. The fact that both events happened within a couple of minutes of our hero doing the unthinkable only proves how ridiculously hasty his actions were, and consequently how ultimately dissatisfying the ending was. It was, as another Stephen King creation, the late great Annie Wilkes, would have said,.....""oogie""."

There was nothing that hasn't been done many times in numerous low grade films. The religious zealot role was predictable & overdone. The ending failed for me and actually irritated me. It tried to push emotional buttons but came off as laughably trite. ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Stand By Me"" are the only films based on a Stephen King work that have turned out to be good films.

It's not long before all sorts of mighty fake looking creepy crawlies come slithering their way out of the mist, and before the people themselves begin going a bit buggy (excuse the pun). None of them is buggier than a crazy religious fanatic played entirely too well by Marcia Gay Harden, who whips the more susceptible into a terrified frenzy with her doomsday babble and becomes a bigger threat than the giant gnats and spiders buzzing around outside. Another group of more rational folk ally themselves with the square-jawed, perfectly stubbled Thomas Jane, who plays a loving dad whose primary concern is his young son. This is the group I'd want to belong to, and it also includes Frances Sternhagen, who starts chucking cans of peas at Harden, to the applause of the audience I saw this with, and the terrific actor Toby Jones, ****SPOILERS AHEAD**** who finally shoots the demented lunatic in the head, again to enthusiastic applause. This wasn't as gratifying to me as seeing her head getting ripped off by a giant octopus would have been, but I guess it's the next best thing.<br/><br/>The movie flirts with greater themes, such as the nature of humanity, the existence of God, etc., but it wisely doesn't veer too far onto any of these paths. Stephen King, despite what Darabont seems to think from his previous films, is not the person to go to for intellectual musings. Darabont makes his film fairly streamlined and sticks to the point, which is to see how and if our merry band of survivors will escape with their lives. I won't ruin the ending for you, but I give the film credit for having the balls to stick with a majorly downbeat ending, even if it did leave me wanting to kill myself. And please heed this movie's R rating -- this is NOT a movie for kids, unless you want your children to be psychologically damaged, in which case go and enjoy.<br/><br/>The film's special effects team can't resist the urge to show us the monsters in all of their tentacled and slimy glory, but I couldn't help but think how much more effective the movie would have been had we never actually seen any of the creatures, and instead had let our imaginations do the work for us.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","Say what you will, but I'm sticking to the title of my comment. It's been a while since a movie played me like the piano, and Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"" managed to permanently etch itself into my mind for numerous reasons. But I'll skip most of them and name just one: it has one of the most memorable endings I've ever seen. The whole movie is pretty good, but the ending made it a great one. The last 5 minutes are simply WOW! This is because Darabont manages to easily add a surprising new aspect to the already multi-layered story and characters...it is undoubtedly the most powerful one in the whole movie, and it fits the mood of the last act PERFECTLY.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason to change the original book ending was, the director knew exactly what he was doing! He successfully avoided the lame, ambiguous anticlimax of letting the viewer decide the fate of the survivors for him/herself...and I have to admit, I really thought I saw that one coming.<br/><br/>Instead you see exactly what happens and how the story ends. Darabont knew there were already too many things left unexplained as it was, so he concluded what he had at his disposal...the human character. This ending is where I got the inspiration for the title of my comment because that's exactly what ""The Mist"" taught me! ...this is where I part, dear reader. If you haven't seen ""The Mist"" yet, you have something to look forward to:)"

","When I go to see a Stephen King movie, I expect to find a multitude of well developed characters thrown into an incredible situation. This is exactly what was presented in THE MIST. Not only did the people in the store react believably, but the acting itself was superb. Marcia Gay Harden's character was perfectly aggravating and the other powerful characters such as Ollie are what really brought me into the center of the action.<br/><br/>Aside from the social mastery of the film, the atmosphere was genuinely terrifying and each creature will make you shiver. The plot develops with plenty of conflicts and leads to a tense climax, which is followed by one shocking ending that will leave you wondering if you were ever on the right side.

","I just got back from watching this great horror movie and what a thrill-ride. Writer-director Frank Darabont has made this movie, like a horror should be made, just like Hitchcock, you build the suspension and don't show anything until you have to. <br/><br/>We don't really see what is out there in the mist until mid-way through the movie, which makes you want to scream at the characters on screen, when they do something stupid or when the creatures attack. My heart is still pounding from the excitement and I'm sure your's will be too. I was kind of disappointed with the ending though and I'm you will be too, but what a movie!"
"Rathko","7","2","6","26 November 2007"," One of the Best King Adaptations
","I read 'The Mist' when I was 12 years old and it begat a lifelong love of the horror genre. It was with great trepidation that I sat down to watch Darabont's movie adaptation, thoroughly expecting it to be completely butchered. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The movie is never as scary as the novella, and the suspense never quite reaches the excruciating heights of King's original story. Darabont fails to play up the unbearable tension (and razor-wire webs) of the spider infested pharmacy which I still vividly remember from the story even after 20 years. There's a nice pseudo-documentary feel to the shaky steadi-cam photography, replete with tight zooms and jump cuts. The creature design is top-notch, though let down by flawed CGI work  especially in the initial loading bay attack. Toby Jones stands out as the most unlikely of heroes, and Marcia Gay Harden makes an excellent bog-eyed sociopath  channeling the Queen of Deranged Christian Fundamentalists, Piper Laurie, in De Palma's 'Carrie'.<br/><br/>But though faithful to the original story and written and directed with some artistry, there's something about the film that falls flat. It lacks the sheer sense of dread of 'The Shining' or the tension of 'Misery'. It's not horrifying or suspenseful enough to become a classic of the genre and for all the time that is spent trying to develop characters through long dialogue sequences, it doesn't add up to the kind of intimate dramatic character portraits that we find in 'The Exorcist'. 'The Mist' lies somewhere in the middle  not quite scary enough. Not quite dramatic enough.<br/><br/>As for the new ending  I didn't mind it so much. It smacks a little too much of the ever-popular gimmicky twist revelation that has become a staple of the horror genre, but I give credit to Darabont and Dimension Films for allowing such a downbeat finale to make it to the final cut.<br/><br/>'The Mist' is one of the best King adaptations to date, combining a quality ensemble cast, quirky scenarios, and occasionally startling visuals to make for a good, though flawed, horror movie."

Heck if you want to make a Stephen King Short Story into a movie, do a couple of them I say and sell em as a double feature.<br/><br/>Overall though The show delivered on it's promise to be creepy and to ""Tweak the mind."" I had this story read to me when I was about 12 years old by an English teacher (Mrs. Wilcox) who edited the bad words but left in all the thrills. That I remember the tale from clear back then (I'm 36 now) speaks to the impact it had.<br/><br/>On a General level the show lived up to my expectations and exceeded them on many levels. The SFX were amazing - the Creatures Horrific - the director didn't go 'Too' crazy on buckets of blood and gore yet it wasn't watered down either. The acting was done well - a good amount of the dialog could have been cut out and still delivered the tale without losing anything.<br/><br/>24 years after hearing the story read to me I was fuzzy on the details. However when it came to the end, I was just sure that Stephen King hadn't written it that way. I was right, and though the ending gives a nice emotional punch to the solar plexus - more reminiscent of European movies - I really wish it would have ended like Stephen King had written it.<br/><br/>And that's my take - Great movie that should have been shortened and stayed a tad more true to the authors original vision.<br/><br/>Thanks,"

","WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS <br/><br/>Frank Darabont has a talent at making Stephen King films good if not better than the novels/novellas. I myself am a big SK fan but a lot of his movies turn out to be crap, but Darabont really has the touch. This is probably the best SK horror film I've seen (better than the Shining) and second only to Shawshank. This film is unpredictable with many twists and turns and possibly the most shocking ending I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The cast in movie is spectacular, Thomas Jane may not be to well known but he does a great job playing the hero. Marcia Gay Harden is definitely my favorite, the audience actually applauded when she died. Andre Bruagher may not be in the movie for long but in the short time he is there he does an excellent job.

","The Mist<br/><br/>Frank Darabount has done a great job directing two previous Stephen King films, The Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile. The Mist is no exception. It is definitively one creepy film.<br/><br/>After a freak electrical storm cripples a small coastal village in Maine the night before, artist David Drayton, his wife Stephanie and his five year old son, notice a strange mist emerging from the lake, which David shrugs off. They walk around their property surveying the damage and notice that a neighbor's tree has fallen on their boathouse, destroying it. David and Billy pay a visit to Brent Norton to discuss payment of the damages and the three decide to venture into town for supplies, leaving David's wife behind. <br/><br/>While there however, they notice that the mist has followed them into town, trapping the small group of people in a supermarket, including David, Billy and neighbor Brent Norton. For three days, they are terrorized by strange creatures, which could be the result of an experiment gone awry at a nearby military base. <br/><br/>This film sucks you in from the beginning to its unexpected and twisty ending. Marcia Gay Harden in her standout performance as Mrs. Carmody plays a religious fanatic who whips the desperate group into a frenzy. The rest of the excellent cast including Thomas Jane, Toby Jones and Andre Braugher do a fine job portraying a bunch of desperate people with nowhere to go. The story is based on the novella included in the anthology, Skeleton Crew. Worth seeing if just once."

","In response to the previous comment, do not say ""way to go Stephen king"" unless you have actually read the novella, not just sat on your but for 2:20. The terrible ending in this movie is nothing that Stephen King would write. His stories have morals and lessons as well as gruesome horror and soft core porn. He would not make an ending like that EVER. The screenplay writers wrote it for cheap shock effects. Stephen King's novella The Mist ends in a Howard Johnson hotel with Drayton and his son together, alive, and hopeful of rescue. In other words, Stephen King does not write cheap shocker endings. He puts his characters in incredibly difficult situations, and often shows how they survive and cope, helping each other along the way."

","This is one of the better Stephen King adaptations out there. It's very similar to the novella and gets most of the plot points and characters right. It helps that the source material isn't as long as other King stories. The movie does feel like a made for TV pilot at times but it doesn't detract from it too much and it's understandable since the budget was tight. The creepy scenes work well, although some of the monsters are a little goofy but I guess it's meant to resemble classic monster movies in a way so it's fine. The core of the story and the human drama at the heart of it are very much the key to this story and the atmosphere of uncertainty and desperation can be felt throughout. As for the ending, it is interesting. I myself prefer the original ending. I prefer the fact that we never know what happened to David's wife in the book as he keeps thinking how he can't afford to go and check. I also prefer that the book seems to say that the monsters have taken over and there is no way they can be defeated as it ends with no scenes of soldiers killing off monsters, instead having the surviving characters trying desperately to survive by moving from location to location, knowing that sooner or later their luck with run out. However, the movie's ending is very bleak and I appreciate the change as it makes the two versions a bit different. Overall, a worthy adaptation even if the novella is better and it proves once again that Frank Darabont is good at adapting Stephen King stories."

","The Mist is a masterpiece of horror filmmaking. Hauntingly atmospheric and yet full of action, deeply thematic and with logical characters you root for. The Mist by celebrated director Frank Darabond is a testimony that a well made horror film is as good as any. Thomas Jane plays an everyday man trapped in a small town's shopping mall as their entire world is engulfed in a white mist on normal morning.

"TheMovieDiorama","5","1","2","27 February 2018"," The Mist tries to create a thrilling atmosphere, but ultimately is just mediocre.
","I've tried to open my eyes up to one of Stephen King's later horror films, but alas with every watch I just feel underwhelmed. A strange elusive mist overshadows a small town where various civilians are trapped in a supermarket. However, within the mist are strange gruesome creatures so it's up to the trapped survivors to try and escape. The situation that is presented is an allegory. Humanity itself is self-destructive. With many different personalities in one secluded location, there's bound to be cliques, differing views and struggle for power. This is where the film succeeds. The paranoia undertone that the narrative conveys is the thrilling element. Utilising the strength of fear to persuade and corrupt others into an idealism. How is that portrayed here? A flipping religious lunatic preaching to the crowd. Oh yes, is it a sly dig at religious conversion? No, I don't think so. It highlights how humans destroy each other, and provides the plot with an antagonist that incredibly infuriated me. The monsters are just there to provide tame scares in all it's horrible CGI glory. Sure they look creative and provide some gruesome aspects, yet somehow I was bored. I wasn't particularly thrilled. I just felt incredibly annoyed at how damn easily people can get corrupted, which in fairness is what the plot was going for. I found the acting to be incredibly mediocre, particularly in the first two acts. Every line of dialogue was monotonous. A few good gory scenes involving mini arachnids bursting out a living person or acid web to the face. Then...the ending arrives. If I wasn't infuriated enough, this was the icing on the cake. I absolutely hated the conclusion. Depressing? Yes. But damn coincidental and convenient if you ask me. I understand the purpose, that even good souls ultimately destroy others. But...urgh. The trapped environment and intelligent narrative is what excites me, everything else was absurdly mediocre. Just...the ending...I despise it."

","Following a devastating storm, a small town in Maine finds that the eerie mist swarming into the neighborhood holds a deadly secret inside that attacks anyone around them and forces a small band of survivors trapped inside a supermarket to hold off the creatures.<br/><br/>This one here is an incredibly frustrating King work. A lot of what makes this one so uneven is due to there being a lot to really like about it, a few points to love about it and then there were elements to utterly loathe about it. The film is at it's best with the way the mounting hysteria over the situation with them trapped within the supermarket and how the groups resolve their problems and start new ones which was pretty good and makes for a realistic feeling to the story, detailing how it all breaks down and what the group resorts to in order to keep their sanity. Likewise, that in turn leads into the films' best efforts in the first few attacks with the unknown creatures inside the mist killing off the victims as they refuse to believe what's out there and rush foolishly into the area which makes for a series of fun times out in the cargo hold and the different attempts to reach safety outside and then encountering the different creatures and their powers were all good points. The flying insects and them trying to keep them out as the different creatures break in resulting in a series of great encounters trying to clear them out of the store, and the insane battle in the pharmacy during the pitch-black interior is a rather stark and creepy experience fighting off the array of creatures that gives this one a ton of impressive points. The final few battles and escapes to get out, the blood and gore and the way that the creatures are dealt with are all loved points here as that all leads into the stellar finale which is an absolutely unforeseen and shocking in what goes on as there are some rather disturbing parts in this section. Along with the fine creature effects, these here are the good parts to really love about it although it does have a few issues to be had here. The film's biggest problem is the mere appearance of the religious babble that gets spewed in here which is so wrongheaded and rather off-putting it just makes the viewer feel like not watching it all that often. Yet another big issue here is the length and how overlong it feels, with the rather overlong sections in the middle really making it feel it's length somewhat. While there's plenty to like here, these do hold it back.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and intense themes of children-in-danger."

","In this film, the life of a small village in the North of the United States is shaken by a mysterious white fog, seemingly unnatural. Quickly, the people realize that something terribly deadly lurks in the fog. Directed and written by Frank Darabont, based on a Stephen King's novel, is the remake of ""The Fog"", 1980. The cast is headed by Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden.<br/><br/>This film is excellent for those who like a horror movie where the greatest danger are people themselves. In fact, despite the horror hidden in the fog is the main antagonist and the greatest element of fear, the way people loses their reason throughout the film is something that we see in horror very often. Sometimes, especially in desperate situations, other people may be more dangerous than the things that cause us fear. The script cleverly explores that connection between fear of the fog (and what it hides) and the alienating effect it causes in people. The film contains several scenes of action and suspense, and scenes that aren't recommended to sensitive public. The end of the film is absolutely baffling and disturbing, one of the most unexpected end I've seen on terror. The cast were up to the challenge. Thomas Jane dominates the film with a very complex and human character, with whom the audience easily create a link. The opposite happens with the character of Marcia Gay Harden, an evangelical fanatic that soon reveals herself absolutely detestable. The tension is guaranteed by photography, which often purposely shakes, and a subtle but annoying soundtrack. The special, visual and sound effects are spectacular."

","I just want to start by addressing the many reviews on this site already and interpret why I think there is such a big mix of love it or hate it. The ending is quite intense. Intense for this middle aged father of two. I don't even know what I would do in such a situation. I know that I would truly be in unfathomable pain to deal with such a loss and knowing how it came about. Only to realize that it could have been avoided. And I think that is part of why this film gets some really negative reviews. People just don't like the truly tragic ending. I was taken back and at first I didn't know what to think. But that was the point...to stir an emotion. That is the impact of this film. Whether you felt heartbroken or not just means it's a great film. It left you feeling a tightness in your stomach and it's an effective movie in that sense. It just left people with a feeling they weren't comfortable with. <br/><br/>Now to why I believe others may give this a bad review...age of the viewer or parental status. A younger person or someone that does not have children may not truly understand the emotion that is unloaded at the end of this movie. I think a lot of people went in expecting to see a monster movie and what they got was a horror tragedy. The creatures are just a vessel to the really scary part of this movie and that is human emotion and how we react to each other and to a desperate situation. <br/><br/>This movie left an imprint on me...whether or not it was a good feeling is really not the point only that it indeed left one. So if all you're after is a campy monster movie, you can skip this one. If you're fan of Stephen King and you want a movie that will stir some emotion as Stephen King often does putting children in the mix of a really bad situation, then sit back and prepare to be crushed."
"Wirxaw","6","1","2","22 February 2015"," Good acting, bad writing.
","I'd like to start by saying that the movie isn't bad. The acting is good, the tension, the realism - it's definitely a worthwhile thing. Even if the premise is pretty cliché, and the explanation is even more so - the movie isn't among the copycats or ripoffs. Although I wouldn't call it a horror. Thriller\Drama - yes. And absolutely no Sci-Fi. I believe King himself drew the line between Terror\Horror and other definitions. Well, ""horror"" being chilled to the very bone - does not fit the definition of this movie. Pathetic clichés of arachnophobia, tentacles, insectophobia, as well as amorphous things people could've been surprised at in 19th century - it just doesn't get the job done in 2000s. Maybe in games...<br/><br/>However, all of that is tolerable. It doesn't make the movie bad, it just doesn't make it outstanding.<br/><br/>What, for me personally, killed the ""whole"" impression of the movie - is the depiction of religion. There is a thin line between good acting\writing and just making the watching process so painful that you cringe. Browsing the internet\going to churches - that's one thing. But the movie is supposed to entertain, and boy was it painful to watch.<br/><br/>And then there was the ending. Well... it's fake. It's so damn fake I can't even describe it. Feels like the writers wanted to squeeze out every ounce of tears and drama from the viewers, they purposefully twisted it. The hero, throughout the ""whole"" movie, was fighting for logic, morale, was trying to save a person dying from burns, and sacrificing more people just for the sake of it. He saved everyone he could, he did everything he could... And in the end... he would just... Not spoiling it, if somebody will bear through this movie - they ""have"" to feel the stupid, stupid disappointment of this ending. That just doesn't make any sense at all. I'd be happy to give this movie 8\10, making it a bland, but very compelling thriller\horror. But with the religious overacting and the ending, I'm afraid I'd feel generous just by giving it 6."

","Movie poster artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane), together with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and assorted others, is trapped inside a supermarket the day after a huge storm. This storm, which may have something to do with an Army project dubbed ""Arrowhead"", has created an ominous mist that blankets *everything*. That makes it scary enough to venture outside, but the mist is also concealing monsters - horrible, ugly, predatory monsters. While a short amount of time passes inside the supermarket, people start losing their minds, forming little groups while some get spurred on by religious fanatic Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden).<br/><br/>The best way to view this creature feature is with writer / director Frank Darabonts' preferred black & white version, which is intended to function as something of a throwback to the b & w monster movies made by Universal and other studios in the 1950s. Here, the special effects come off the best and the atmosphere is undeniable. Darabont, adapting the novella by Stephen King for the screen, does well at creating tension and suspense. Once the things start to crawl out of the woodwork, the sense of mystery dissipates, but at least there is some good action to enjoy when this happens.<br/><br/>Carried over from Kings' story is an overriding dose of social commentary, specifically the idea that humanity ceases to mean much in times of extreme stress and danger. This may seem to some people as being very cynical, but this viewer can't help but agree.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not all of the dialogue is that hot, and Darabont appears to have used the worst possible take from most of the actors in most scenes. They've been much better utilized elsewhere. Harden does the best she can, trying not to turn Mrs. Carmody into an outright cartoon character or caricature. Jane is okay in the hero role but his hysterics at the end are utterly laughable. Frances Sternhagen is great fun as feisty old lady Irene Reppler, and Darabont works with some of his reliable old hands such as William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Brian Libby. If fans of 'The Walking Dead' go and watch this now, they'll recognize ""Carol"", a.k.a. Melissa McBride, as the mother in the supermarket.<br/><br/>The ending here, significantly changed from the novella, is a matter of debate among many fans. Some find it all too effective and disturbing.

","When I first watched The Mist, it was shortly after its 2007 release. Little did I know that the name Frank Darabont would soon become much more famous. So it is no surprise that the creator of The Walking Dead would cast three familiar faces in The Mist, those being Melissa McBride, Laurie Holden, and Jeffrey DeMunn. <br/><br/>Watching The Mist a second time allowed me to appreciate solid character and plot development, something both unusual and refreshing in a horror movie. We experience the humanity, pain, and panic of a bunch of people in a small northeastern town thrown together by a supernatural creature which is both frightening and deadly. Each of the characters respond differently, some not believing while others lose rationality, but all are forced to confront separate developing factions from within, while trying to survive the attacking monster from outside. <br/><br/>Kudos to the actors whose characters represent each end of the behavioral spectrum: Toby Jones, whose character Ollie is the voice of reason while trying to control chaos, and Marcia Gay Harden, whose character Mrs. Carmody goes off the deep end with a distorted view of The Old Testament's form of punishment for the sins of the people. Add to that the main character of David Drayton, played by Thomas Jane, who simply wants to save his son from this unspeakable horror. Where David Drayton winds up at the end of the movie was a shocking twist, and a great addition to a very well done horror flick."

Disappointingly, this films ending lacks the pitch black social criticism of Romero's ending, wherein - of course - the ""establishment"" rescuers ended up killing the films heroic survivor. Instead, in this version, the rescuers are merely too late to stop our hero from doing something horrific, yet they are seemingly quite successfully at saving many others. Thus, in the end, the ""moral"" of THE MIST seems to simply be about the power of fear to make us behave toward each other in terrible ways. Sure, there's an important message there, but it lacks the political bite of the message in the film that it borrows from, thus making it feel inferior. And by substituting creatures-from-another-dimension for zombies, the film also loses an additional, dread-inspiring, man-against-himself element.<br/><br/>But enough with comparisons to NOTLD, you say? OK, but there's also this... by setting the story in a supermarket, King has also borrowed significantly from another Romero film, DAWN OF THE DEAD. And sadly, it does so without including any equivalent to DAWN's darkly comic social critique. In short, THE MIST can't help but be compared to these other films, and these comparisons can only leave it lacking. Though I enjoyed THE MIST, and would certainly watch it again, I very much wish King had found a more fully original structure to hang his story on."
"DoomDealer","7","1","2","12 March 2014"," A missed opportunity
","It is hard to believe that this film was directed by Frank Darabont, the very same man who directed two of the best films ever made, namely The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, The Mist is in many ways a very good film, but it could have been so much more. It's nowhere near the same quality as his other two milestones mentioned above. The plot isn't very original (I might even say, Stephen King took quite a bit of inspiration from John Carpenter's The Fog), occasionally it's frustrating, a little bit too slow-paced, the special effects are average at best and the end is just - dare I say it - ridiculous. It's the sort of thing you come up with if you're actually stuck for a decent ending; you just make one up. You then either go with whatever comes to mind first or you try to think of the most ridiculous or outrageous thing possible. Same here. And not only here, but the film adaptation of Stephen King's ""It"" smacks of the same problem. Perhaps it was just a desperate attempt to come up with something that will stay with people regardless of whether or not they actually liked the film itself. If this was their objective then they've certainly achieved it. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the ending will be the only thing you'll remember about this film. <br/><br/>Darabont clearly did not have the same sort of budget for this film as he did for the other two, and he clearly didn't have the sort of high profile writers and producers; he certainly didn't have any high profile actors for this. David Jane, William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn are great and carry the film very well, but they're not of the same calibre as Tom Hanks or Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>The Mist is very good. It's not one of those films that will make you feel like you've just lost two hours of your life that you'll never get back, but it's certainly not a blockbuster either. <br/><br/>Watch it and enjoy it ... just don't expect too much."
"brandonmouser","7","1","2","27 July 2011"," Loved everything but the new ending
","In my opinion, ""The Mist"" is one of King's best short stories, and happens to be my personal favorite. Darabont is an awesome writer and director, and for the most part the film itself is awesome. The character development is effective, casting is good, the special effects and creature design are excellent, and the film is well-directed. Probably Marcia Gay Harden's best performance. Thomas Jane did well, too, and the supporting cast was wonderful.<br/><br/>If you've never read the original short story, you'll probably love everything about this film. I was a little disappointed that David and Amanda's sexual encounter was removed (it seemed to de-King things for me) but this is something easily gotten over. However, the new ending is AWFUL in my opinion. At the end of the movie, I felt like someone made me a flawless ice cream sundae and then spit in it for no good reason.<br/><br/>First of all, you have to realize that the scariest aspect of the original story is that there was no end, no easy solution, no happy ending. The story ended, but in your mind the characters kept going--off into who knows what. No one was in control and survival was the only goal. On the other hand, Darabont's ending, which was an annoying ""gotcha"" twist, ruined this part of the story. We learn the ultimate fate of the main characters. We learn the ultimate fate of the world: government has things under control. ""The Mist"" went from being a never-ending, mysterious horror to a temporary disaster, essentially stripping it of its power and imagination.<br/><br/>That brings me to my next point: the original story is pretty cynical towards the status quo. The military-industrial complex causes a problem that it cannot fix. Akin to nuclear or biological war, our government has basically destroyed the world beyond comprehension. So, there was a moral to King's version. Unfortunately, the new ending also denies us this moral. Darabont's ending shows the government in control, regaining some moral high ground, cleaning up its mess and restoring law and order. Anarchy was never there. This more nationalistic ending will be very disappointing for people who loved the original.<br/><br/>Third, it really goes against the character development to have an ending where all the survivalists commit suicide. We're led to believe that these people have courage, skills, intelligence, etc., and we witness them using these abilities to escape both monsters and a human mob...only to kill themselves when they run out of gas? I think it's more likely that they would make a run for a building or remember to fill up...<br/><br/>I know that King endorsed the new ending, but I don't care. Sorry--he's simply wrong about this one in my opinion, and anyone who loved reading ""The Mist"" will probably agree. Darabont: (You have redeemed yourself with The Walking Dead) we still love you, but what were you thinking? I was hoping they'd release a DVD with an alternate ending, but I haven't seen one to date, so this is what I recommend to make this film go from OK to AMAZING. Just turn the television off a few minutes early. Watch the film, love every minute of it, daydream that a sex scene happened, and then be ready to turn it off as the truck drives off into the mist in absolute uncertainty, just like it did in the original story..."

","Stephen King strikes again.. the Mist. Frank Darabont directs this one based on a steven king novel. i thought Marcia Gay Harden was the perfect choice for the radical Christian lady spreading her ""word"" of god in the grocery store. Thomas Jane in the lead , i got so used to him in Punisher, it took awhile for me to get used to him in this role. as far as the movie itself goes, it's definitely not for everyone there are very strong religious views in this movie, basically the premise is that a ""mist"" comes down from the mountain and envelops the town, there is a little mystery of what caused it, you see national guard and police fire vehicles going to what appears to be the mountain,, there is mention that maybe the army caused this mist, an experiment gone wrong, then there's the belief that it's one of the signs and it the end of the world, what is really annoying to me is that every year you get movies that come out in pairs ie happening and mist.. like they want you to compare the two, i have been a stephen king fan for over 20 years and enjoy his work immensely, i enjoyed this movie very much and highly recommend it to anyone as long as you're not to squeamish."

I pay the cost of the disc, say goodbye to the store clerk and i go on my merry lil' way.<br/><br/>I get home, fix some dinner, pop in the DVD and start watching. Well... By the end of the movie, my plate was still half-full and the food is completely cold now. I almost didn't eat anything because i was so engaged into the damn movie! This movie kicks ASS! I'm a major horror buff and i haven't been on the edge of my seat from a movie for ages, but ""The Mist"" put me there in about twenty minutes, until the credit roll! What a thrill ride! Wonderful character development, great acting performances, and one hell of an unexpected ending. Unlike most movies nowadays this one actually takes it's time to build up the story and characters. That's really a rare treat! The ONLY thing i have to criticize is that the monsters sometime look a bit... fake. Well, of course they are fake, but you know what i mean. But in all honesty it didn't even bother me after a while because i was so into the movie that i couldn't have cared less.<br/><br/>I was alone in my living room, and i actually went ""What??"" ""Noooo!"" ""Are you serious?!?"" to the TV! I can't even recall the last time i did that with a movie! So no, i'm not telling you anything about the movie itself. It has monsters in it. There. Now go buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever! Just watch it if you love horror and/or suspense movies. ""The Mist"" is AWESOME!"
"Captain_Couth","8","1","2","4 March 2009"," Stephen King's film adaptations: The Mist
","The Mist (2007) is a very entertaining film from Frank Darabont. I was surprised by how well this film was. Because Frank Darabont directed it, I thought it would be another weepy flick like The Green Mile or The Shawshank Redemption. Boy was I wrong. I would rank this at the top of Stephen King's movie adaptations. It not only stayed very true to the original source material, but it improved on several things (Mrs. Carmody was hot instead of a being an old crone being one). The story is one of survival horror, a strange mist comes into town bringing with it something wicked and terrifying.<br/><br/>I wished the theatrical release was shot in black and white (When Stephen King wrote The Mist he always pictured it being shot in Cinemascope and in black and white). Darabont also felt the same way but shot the film in color for commercial reasons (but the two disc DVD has a black in white version!) A very awesome flick that's a scary, creepy and a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>Highly recommended"
"simoesfelipe","6","1","2","2 December 2008"," The Real Hero
","The movie compares the mist with the path we're taking for our world nowadays, with all the disregard for the environment. People only talk that we should take effective actions to stop global warming, but few actually do something about it. People often choose the ""easy way"", turning themselves to religion explanation and blaming others for what is happening. You'll be surprised to learn that the real hero of this movie is not Thomas Jane's character David, but the woman who gets out of the supermarket in the beginning of the movie to rescue her child. She's the only one who really faces the situation. Even David gives up in the end, believing that they could only survive as far as the fuel of the car took them to. The movie makes us think about how we should act in the future. Do we want to face the situation and find a solution to our problems or ""leave the window open"", saying we'll ""fix it later""?"
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","2","2 December 2008"," Probably the best adaptation of a King story to date...
","Major Spoilers: <br/><br/>Frank Darabont's adaptations of Stephen King stories seem to be as successful as Mick Garris's are pedestrian. Here he departs from the prison movie  although there are plenty of imprisoned characters here  to deliver an intelligently written and presented horror film. This is no stalk-and-slash film. There are no cheap scares, and the judicious use of hand-held cameras lend an immediacy and believability to the fantastic story that unfolds. The film is two hours long, but the time flies and, despite some occasionally suspect special effects, the set-pieces really hold you on the edge of your seat. The creatures here are so fantastic and bizarre, the room for invention and imagination so vast, that you just don't know what horrors are going to befall the unlucky shoppers in the small town supermarket suddenly shrouded in a deadly mist.<br/><br/>I read King's novella a long time ago, but it was so entertaining that I still remember it well and, although this film is probably as good an adaptation as it's possible to make, there were a couple of things that didn't quite work for me. Although Marcia Gay Harden is excellent in her role as the religious zealot Mrs Carmody, she is far removed from King's portrayal of the character. If I remember correctly, the character in his novella was old and overweight and wore ugly glasses, while Harden's interpretation is too Hollywood. Give her a makeover and she could dazzle as she sashayed down the red carpet. I think King's idea was that both Mrs Carmody and her outspoken views were mildly grotesque to ordinary people in the 'normal' world, but that grotesqueness is slowly eroded in the minds of her fellow captors as the layers of normality in their world are stripped away by each successive attack from the monsters in the mist.<br/><br/>Secondly, the ending doesn't work for me. There is no ending as such in the novella. We leave Drayton and his new family somewhere on the mist-shrouded road, heading for Bangor, Maine, spurred on by the briefest, dimmest snatch of dialogue heard amidst the static coming from their car radio. The twist ending that Darabont manufactures certainly has its momentary shock value, but once that has passed you start wondering why Drayton is so quick to kill off his fellow travellers. I suppose it is near impossible to end the movie the way the novella ends  at least without a narration from Drayton  but it still rankles a little.<br/><br/>Despite these relatively minor gripes, this is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. There aren't many mainstream Hollywood horror flicks that find time for philosophical debate in the midst of all the carnage, but The Mist manages it without the moment sticking out like a sore thumb. It also offers as much to fear from the people inside the supermarket  and the fickle dangers of human nature under stress  as it does from the monstrosities crashing into the supermarket's plate glass windows"

","Firs of all, i'd like to say I saw this movie quite a long time after it came out and i had heard a lot of mixed reviews. I would also like to say that I am a big Frank Darabont fan but agreed with the majority when I thought that he could only do prison drama's because The Majestic was terrible. This film has a fairly simplistic plot and story, what attracted me to it was the fact that it wasn't about people trying to defeat or kill whatever it was in the mist, it was just people trying to survive in trying times. After about 30 minutes I couldn't stop thinking about William Golding's The Lord Of The Flies. It has the same premise and even some of the characters are similar. It moves at the same pace and invokes the same feelings. I think Stephen King must have had Lord of the Flies in mind when he was writing the novella and Frank Darabont when writing the screenplay. I found the acting to be as good as anything else I have seen this year and the directing was top notch. While the direction was great it was very different to Darabonts earlier films. The one negative point I have to make about this film is the graphic's. I understand that this film was relatively low budget but you can tell that this was'nt really the area the production team focused on. Although some could argue that the bad special effects are in keeping with the genre. All in all, this was a very good film<br/><br/>8/10"
"thefrohmen","8","1","2","2 July 2008"," Worth Buying for Some
","Note: I have re-done my old post due to the fact I felt it contained too much personal input not necessary to the review (and I know I was being a little contraindicating). I now intend to try and use facts as much as possible instead. ___________________<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like the Tommyknockers film, but I do like most of the other Stephen King movies, such as the Shining and Pet Cemetery. I'm a devote fan of Mr. King's novels. I decided to take my father, since it looked good and he enjoys King movies.<br/><br/>The characters and the scenario as a whole were fantastic. Completely plausible. The creatures did a good job scaring the hell out of you and causing you to look behind your back every second. <br/><br/>The film is pretty grim, but it does have its moments when you can afford to laugh due to some funny jokes. However, the only part I disliked was the ending, which I found pretty damn stupid and dark.<br/><br/>That being said, here are my simple list of pluses and minuses: 1) The acting is super and you can really hate the antagonist zealot. 2) The monsters are life-like and made me creeped out. 3) The special effects (mainly the blood and whatnot) are in large amounts and very realistic. 4) The story follows the novel pretty well. 5) There isn't too much fighting, yet enough to satisfy you. 6) These actors really get into their roll. 7) The infightng remains true to the usual King ""Humanity VS Itself"" theme.<br/><br/>The only negative things I have to say are: 1)The ending is really dark, and I found it lacking in taste. 2) A few people weren't to the full extent of their characters. 2) Sometimes there could have been some more fighting, such as showing the military battling said monsters.<br/><br/>All in all, it still gets an 8 for a good piece of work. Acting, effects, and directing are good. My hat off to the director for taking this large task and making it enjoyable experience for me. Whether you like it or not, I personally loved it. I pray that if they make a sequel it will be at least as good (or better!)"
"three_am","8","1","2","13 June 2008"," A memorable Stephen King short story
","I read this short story in what feels like a decade ago. It was not that outstanding to me, but seeing it as a motion picture worked for me. I can't shake the feeling of complete and utter despair after just watching it. (The ending scene will do this to you.) All the elements were there for making it a well produced movie. The special effects were adequate, the acting was believable and worthy, and the plot was straight forward and simple. It was an entirely ""what if"" story complete with WTF moments and dialogue even I would have said if I was in the same situation and this is what truly makes the movie. The ending scene will take some time to erase from the brain and memory simply because it ended on a truly depressing and gloomy note. I won't spoil the plot to anyone but would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed The Host and Cloverfield. Stephen King writes a mean and lean sci-fi/fantasy short story from his Skeleton Crew collection. I would love to see them make The Jaunt a movie too.<br/><br/>5 of out of 5 stars from me."

I can't give it away but it will blow your mind! <br/><br/>The acting is very solid the whole time with power house performances from Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden and Andre Braugher. I loved the story and was genuinely creeped out by it the entire time. There is great gore and some great creatures, however, I felt that the CGI bogged these down a bit, but that's the only thing I can really complain about.

"dmark-10","8","1","2","12 May 2008"," Uneven, but genuinely affecting
","Having enjoyed the original Stephen King ""novella"" (more like a short story) as a child, I looked forward to seeing this movie, despite my lack of enthusiasm for movie monsters (especially those generated by computer software) and horror in general (haven't seen a decent scary movie in twenty years.)<br/><br/>After a fairly effective setup, the appearance of the first monster (or part of it) was quite disappointing. The cartoonish CGI did not mesh well with the realistic bloodletting. The story required menacing monsters to create a sense of dread and to give the characters believable motivation for their aberrant (and often abhorrent) actions.<br/><br/>Then the one-dimensional characters (basically unchanged from the short story) started up with the talky pathos (also straight from the outdated source material) and I was ready to turn it off.<br/><br/>Things improved drastically on the appearance of the next round of monsters. Thrilling action sequences and genuinely scary jolts ensued. The on-the-cheap CGI improved with each new species of creature. The smaller ones that are seen close up are truly menacing and the larger ones that appear shrouded in mist are certainly dread-inducing.<br/><br/>Interspersed with the monster attacks were shrill arguments between the ensemble of characters and an all-too-fast build-up to a Lord of the Flies style splintering of the survivors into two distinct camps.<br/><br/>At two hours, some have said that the movie is over-long. I think the opposite is true as the inevitable polarization and breakdown of the mini-society happens unbelievably quickly. Nevertheless, I was glad to see that part come to a climax.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that I knew what they would find, when the protagonists' camp debarked from the grocery store, I was as involved as I could possibly be in a low-budget monster movie. The subsequent sequence featured masterfully disturbing imagery and perfectly suited eerie music. Thirty years of desensitization to on-screen horror went right out the window. One particular image was so shocking that I am sure I will never forget it (you'll know it when you see it.) Suffice to say that five minutes was all it took for an enjoyable B-movie thrill ride to turn into a classic. Unlike the recent crop of yawn-inducing remakes and pseudo-snuff films, this is a real horror movie. The genre isn't dead after all!<br/><br/>The penultimate scene with the largest of the monsters is exactly as I imagined it in the story. That really should have been the ending (and basically was in print.) The on-screen ending seemed contrived to me, and far too depressing (it is hard to believe they got it past test audiences.) It was a gutsy move by the filmmakers as they had to know it would make for a commercial failure (indeed, the movie flopped in theaters.) It took additional hubris to release such a downer of a movie at Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>All-in-all, though less than the sum of its parts, The Mist is quite an accomplishment, made even more amazing when you consider the outdated and somewhat trite source material."
"iamstyx","9","1","2","11 May 2008"," Everything I hoped for.
","I'm a big Stephen King fan and have read most of his works. Yes I do agree not all his stuff are great, and he tend to repeat his themes quite often. 'The Mist' is based on one of his short stories that I happen to like a lot. The first time I read it I immediately started to wonder what it would look like as a movie. The problem is few Stephen King stories have adapted well to the screen, especially the ones when the man himself acted as director. Let's face it, King should stick to writing...<br/><br/>Clearly, by judging from his previous King adapt-ions, Frank Darabont is a man who knows his stuff and how to transfer the mood and tension from Kings writing to the cinema.<br/><br/>The Mist is dark, foreboding and everything the short story is. It was exactly like how I imagined it. I mean almost every single detail was there. Sure he took some liberties with the script, but overall it stays very true to the original story, well apart from the ending. I wont really say anything about that, but I guess you will either love it or hate it.<br/><br/>Overall Frank Darabont delivers again with his first adaption of a horror tale. As someone said earlier, he should be the only one allowed to work with Kings stories, and I really hope he keep doing so."

","Really fine effort by Darabont. Its the kind of Stephen King story that is really difficult to translate successfully to screen. This story could easily have turned out to be a cheap forgettable horror trip like Tommyknockers or Langoliers for example, but Darabont manages to avoid this.<br/><br/>The suspense is razor-edged throughout and considering the premise for the movie - massive spiders, huge tentacle'd monsters and dinosaur like birds - that is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>I wish Darabont would direct more of King's tales - he seems to have the knack of doing them well.<br/><br/>A solid 8 out of 10 for me."

","There have been only been a few horror movies in this millennium, that have actually been somewhat memorable to me. They go by he names SAW, THE DESCENT, and now THE MIST. What do these movies have in common? Perhaps it's because they were all directed very well and actually gave some chills down my spine or maybe they were all original in their own way. Anyways, The Mist could even be my new favorite horror movie.<br/><br/>I'll admit right away, I'm not a huge fan of horrors. Usually they are a crappy PG 13 horror with no scares or they just throw as much blood and gore as they can which doesn't even help entice the story. Yes, The mist is very disturbing and you will see someone cut in two or wrapped up in a web but it just makes the movie even more frightening.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane (might remember from the Punisher) was perfect as the lead in this movie. He was so likable in the first five minutes of the movie that you cared for him and hope that he does make it through the entire movie as in some horrors, you want the lead actor die as soon as possible because of how stupid they are. Marcia Gay Harden, who I can't stand, played the perfect villain. Maybe it's because I can't stand her and hated her character in the first line that she delivered but they really couldn't of picked a more disturbed woman who thought everyone deserved what they got from The mist.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in a shopping mart. All the customers are scared to leave the store as a giant mist has devoured the city. people turn on each other as they go crazy from being isolated so long from the mist. Sides are also made. This movie keeps your interest all they way through.<br/><br/>What really made this ending as for what made SAW to me was the ending. The ending for the mist was so disturbing but yet so perfect and will haunt your mind for weeks after you watch it. Kind of like the ending of American History X.<br/><br/>So you horror fans who are trying so hard to find a decent horror, the Mist shouldn't disappoint. Even though I would consider it more as a Sci-fi drama, I'll also call it a horror to give myself hope that their is still hope that horrors can be just as effective again as they once were.<br/><br/>THE MIST 9/10 or A"

","Most horror movies are lame excuses for freak/gore shows. Now here's a movie that I can genuinely say will make you feel horror of the sort that rings ""The Horror! The Horror!"" in your head. The way humans crack up under the circumstances and Frank Darabont's excellent touch to the ending will make sure this horror lingers with you long after you are done watching the movie. I feel Frank's main treatment of this excellent Stephen King work is more with an attempt to investigate human condition rather than just making a routine chill and thrill fare. His class as a director comes through as it becomes apparent that more than the unknown of the outside world, we ought to be more afraid of what we don't know of ourselves - of what we could do or turn into when vulnerable. And that, is the greater horror, the greater monster.<br/><br/>9 on 10, since I feel that apart from Marcia Gay Harden, the other performances though good, were not great. Needed a Jack Nicholson."

"sagan-1","8","1","2","1 May 2008"," A very good metaphor!!
","These were two days for monster movies. Yesterday, ""Cloverfield"" (loved it) and today, ""The Mist"". First off, ""The Mist"" is a very good movie. The acting is very good, the mood created with the fog is superb and the creatures are good, also, but these last are only accessories to the story, in my opinion. Stephen King is a sucker for cabin fever, and how well he portrays it. Frank Darabont has already shown to have a keen eye in translating King's stories to the big screen. But now, most important, the metaphor. This story brings about a very subtle reality in which we live in, a very thin line between civilization and chaos. Let's take this back to sci-fi from the 40's or the 50's. By know, the year 2000, we should have already settled on the moon, been to Mars, have a better world, etc, etc. But none of that happened. Instead, we live in a world where on one side there's war, death, disease, famine, fanaticism. On the other side, there's civilization (assumed...), richness, well-being, comfort. How thin is the line between these two? Very much so. Are we really, on this supposed civilized side, so able to carry on the flag of our values if this same civilization was to collapse? Are we, as people, any better under stress than those so-called ""uncivilized""? How would we justify our actions under another scenario? These are subtle questions (not so subtle, sometimes) asked and shown throughout the movie. Some of them have very strong mirrors in what's happening in the world today. And as most stories of the sort, it takes a great danger to unite everybody, no matter color, creed, flag, against the common foe. But are we really able to do that, come the time for it? Are these only faint shards of hope to make us believe that, as a character from the movie says, we all share an inheritance of good, underneath it all?<br/><br/>I believe so, but sometimes i'm led into questioning my belief. And that's what i found out as best in this movie. And i think that there is no criticism in the movie about religion, but about fanaticism, and how embedded it is in our nature. Unfortunately.<br/><br/>Please, if you haven't yet, watch this movie. Indulge yourself onto King's view of human nature. And no, he doesn't have a solution for it. The solution is in our own hands. Something we should be considering, instead of burying our heads in the sand."

","I had wanted to see this film for a long time, and was not let down. Like many others, I am a King fan on both page and screen, ""The Mist"" scores on all levels. Okay, I understand some people's problems with the CGI effects, and I had the same problems as well, but the CGI was not used constantly or whenever something frightening was happening. What we are left with is old school horror... First building characters that the audience can identify and care about, then putting them in the most horrific circumstances imaginable. Director Frank Darabont delivers this to us in heavy doses, as I sat on the edge of my seat through most of the film. I also believe the mood of a horror film is important, and Darabont sets it up quickly and elevates it throughout the remainder of the story. I think it would have been just as creepy had they not shown the creatures (perhaps even more), but I can't complain about how it turned out. The acting is superb by everyone involved. Down to the smallest extra, the cast gave an exceptional portrayal of what people might act like in such a predicament. In the end... This is ""Horror 101"", and the best King adaptation I have seen in quite a while. Highly recommended to those who are looking for a quality evening with some priceless horror."
"hudiefanny","8","1","2","30 April 2008"," The Mist-The Unknown
","The Mist, I watched this movie quite a few days ago. I could not say that it's a great movie; however, it did inspire me into sort of thinking. What's in the mist? This is a question that has been asking throughout the whole movie, by people stuck in that town supermarket and by the audience as well. Is it important? Yes and No. I'm not trying to play any literal game. What I mean is that the things in the mist scared people but what people were scared about is far beyond the mystery hiding behind the mist. They looked more frightened when they were waiting than when they were fighting with the huge insects and queered birds that broke in through the window. People tend to be tough and optimistic if they know clearly about what they're handling. No matter how hard it is, they'll finally figure out the solutions. But when everything's just ambiguous in the mist, the horror expands to the extreme. What terrifies us is usually the unknown rather than the horrors we know. <br/><br/>Quite a few people lost their mind out of dread. That's exactly why they choose to believe in that moonstruck woman. She pretended to master some godly power which those people didn't understand either. The unknown vs the unknown. They thought she might be able to confront the unpredictable disasters concealed in the mist and save their lives. When a person runs into something that cannot be explained by common senses and gradually loses his confidence, he has to turn to some other believes to keep him spiritually secure and make him consoled. It's a wrong and perilous way, which will eventually lead its disciples into insanity and destruction. The cost for temporary delusion of feeling better is losing all senses and giving in to inhumanity. <br/><br/>Yet David and some others remained with reasonable judgments, especially David who even became a leader or hero of this small group. So was the lady who seemed to be a little bit crazy at first when she insisted in getting out of the supermarket right away and going home for her little daughter. But at the end of the movie, her staying safe with her daughter besides her in that military truck proves that she made the right decisions and took proper actions. She did it and it worked. The different ending for her and David might be caused only by a little luck. She's luckier than David, I assume. I bet she would choose to stay in the supermarket as David did if she took her daughter with her and David would definitely go back home for his family if he left his son at home with his wife. I'd like to appraise the lady as a winner of life but hate to hear someone calling David a loser. He's not. David tried every chance he had to save his son and even some strangers. He's human being so that he had his weakness. They were both courageous and strong-minded. What were their sources of courage and strength? Their parental love. That's what we say that people's value does not lie in what we acquire from life but in how we're needed by others. Giving is better than getting, sometimes. <br/><br/>Let's leave the movie alone and look back into our really lives. Are we ever frightened by something unknown to us? About career, about love, about family, about life, about future, and even about ourselves? What shall we do to face the horror deep in our hearts? Following somebody else blindly, committing suicide under the unbearable stress, hurting others to make ourselves feel a little bit better, being carried away and destroyed in despair, or staying firmly with our belief and trying to find some way out with our greatest efforts and courage? Do we know what we're fighting for rather than only what we're fighting with? I know my answers. Do you?"

"Bifrostedflake","9","1","2","26 March 2008"," A new classic piece of horror!
","I must begin by saying, that I HATE adaptations. Ninety nine times out of a hundred, a book to movie adaptation will just inspire hours long of ranting from myself about how much the movie cut from the plot.<br/><br/>However, in this case, I have to say that I was very impressed. 'The Mist' is one of my favourite Stephen King stories and I was more than pleased with the adaptation.<br/><br/>The suspense throughout the movie is laid on thickly, which at some points can be uncomfortable to sit through. Without having to rely on jumps and gore, The Mist creates a reminder of the tension that horror movies used to be so good at.<br/><br/>While the characters are likable and the dialogue isn't heavy with undertones, the simple idea that the monsters outside, can become the monsters inside you, is one I can get on-board with.<br/><br/>The main players, Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden are generous and do not try to steal the screen away from excellent supporting actors such as William Sadler, Jeffery DeMunn and Frances Sternhagen. Performances across the board were generally compelling to watch, at no point did I ever think; that guy was better in _______ film. The rawness of the film made it feel more like we were watching a snippet or real life. No matter how extraordinary the circumstances.<br/><br/>Some die-hard fans of the novella, may be unhappy with some of the directors choices, but overall, I felt it was an excellent way of spending two hours."
"rhinocerosfive-1","8","1","2","25 March 2008"," How about a little tolerance, Hollywood?
","THE MIST is really, really scary, and overall the best Stephen King adaptation since THE SHINING - though it works for opposite reasons. Where Stanley Kubrick bends the story to the medium, Frank Darabont stays remarkably faithful to the novella, which has as its primary strength a nice lack of explanation. This movie is mostly uncomplicated, creepy all the time and shocking when it needs to be. <br/><br/>But man, am I sick of seeing every Christian portrayed as a goddamn psychopath in every goddamn movie. I have Christian friends, Buddhist friends, Muslim friends, Jewish friends, Hindu friends, you name it - and none of my friends is one trauma away from claiming divine authority. In fact, though I was raised in a very small town, I don't think I've ever met anyone so irrationally fundamentalist as to fly a plane into a building, or call for human sacrifice to appease the tentacles. Do extremists exist? We know that they do. They have TV shows, and sometimes they get to be president. But why is it so rare for Hollywood to reflect the majority of observant Christians who are tolerant, intelligent, humanist, and compassionate? For these personal peeves, and although Marcia Gay Harden is a fine actress, I tired of the religious mania angle well before that part of the movie was over.<br/><br/>However, it must be said that the movie moves, and anything you don't like - except horror - is replaced by a new dynamic within a few minutes. The outstanding cast, including Andre Braugher and Frances Sternhagen, roots us in a reality all too awful, and it's hard not to care about characters this well-drawn, in scenes this well-directed. When Bill Sadler started screaming at those giant spiders, well, I forgot my issues with the movie's politics and started screaming too. Actually I started jumping up and down in my living room. I don't know what I would have done if I'd been in a movie theater. Too bad the Weinstein company didn't advertise this thing strongly enough to let me see what that would have been like.<br/><br/>I do have an issue with the end of the movie. Please note spoiler alert above.<br/><br/>The novella ends with the Land Rover headed out into the misty unknown, without resolution, with hardly any hope... but some. I think this would have been a fine ending for a movie. The DVD version I watched ends with Tom Jane's mercy killing of his own son, just before the cavalry arrives. This strikes me as a rather perverse and cynical ending for what is otherwise not much of a morality tale. Looking back, though, there is a strong thread of misanthropy throughout the film: one of the most sympathetic characters declares that he has no faith whatever in human nature, and we aren't given a lot of contrary evidence. Okay. But why? Are we so depraved as a species? Are there so few of us capable of moral judgment? It is a telling joke that Darabont's hero, his most gallant and clear-headed character, is... an artist. This smacks of holier-than-thouism. But if that's the agenda, why make the artist commit an error as terrible as those of the fire-and-brimstone crowd? Is this incoherence, or simply a vicious new worldview from a formerly unrepentant sentimentalist?"

"jedp2","8","1","2","9 March 2008"," Directorial Triumph
","Since I first viewed ""Carrie"" on the big screen, I became an instant fan of Stephen King and his work because of the detail to his characters. I relentlessly pored over ""Salem's Lot"" then ""The Shining"" and appreciated the intensity of ""Cujo"" as a diversion from the Man vs. Spirit to the Man vs. Nature, or the specific animal in that instance. Of course the Man vs. Machine was melded against an unknown spirit in ""Christine"" and ""Maximum Overdrive."" But one thing I've noticed in quite a few of King's works is the tendency to sputter on the ending especially on his longer works like ""The Stand"" which I started one Sunday night long ago and called in sick that Monday to finish the 1,000+ page novel I was so engrossed in I couldn't put it down.<br/><br/>Noticing an earlier review, I was alerted that the director of ""The Mist"" and ""The Green Mile"" were one in the same, ""Mile"" being in my top ten all-time movie favorites and now I will always look to see if this director is interpreting another King work for the screen. I'll still watch it if he doesn't, but I will make time for his movie because he is a great complement to Mr. King's end game dilemma of sorts. Better than the first iteration of ""The Mist"" but not by much. The ending--although different from almost any other King or non-King movie I've ever seen--sealed the deal for me: heroes are not always infallible even when they have best interests at heart . . . just like in real life."
"the_ghostman0","6","1","2","8 March 2008"," If only the ending was different....
","I honestly did not even imagine to sign up on IMDb until I watched this movie. It was great and all UNTIL I watched the ending.....that was a BIG let down for me.<br/><br/>I'll start off with the pros: The movie had a lot of action, suspense, fear etc. I honestly did not feel that amount of fear or feeling for the characters since I first watched ""Aliens"". The director very nearly copy's the book's events with certain tweaks to make it even more enjoyable. If your a big fan of ""Aliens"", you'll certainly love this film....UNTIL.....<br/><br/>THE ENDING!!! *Dun....Dunn.....Duuuuuuhhh*.....I must brutally say that the ending was a HUGE turnoff for me. I went let out anything from the story, but all I can say is that if the ending was a bit more....lets say....logical and less cheap emotion, this film would've been the best I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>However, I have a lot of forgiveness when it comes to films, if it gets me spooked or if it gets my imagination flying, then its a good one. This one had it almost done until the end came about. That itself drops down a lot of stars for this rating. I am going to be generous though and give it a rating of 6.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: If your just looking to get your psyche revved up, or just simply don't care for meanings and just want a good ol' darn action/suspense/scifi/horror film, this one is just for you."

I'm sure that a studio meeting with Mr. King involves him looking around the room, seeing if there are any unattended scripts, or LOOSE OBJECTS that he can base a story on, and walking off with a big FAT check... that's just sad.

So bad cliché and so annoying than believe me or not, there was a round of applause when she finally got a bullet in the head.<br/><br/>To finalise, it was a disaster, total waste of money and time and in spite of the good ending it all summed up to being one of the worst movies of all times for me."

","Frankly, I was really amazed to see this film get a good rating on IMDb. I went to see this film with a friend about a week ago, and we were amazed at how terrible this movie was. I can honestly say it was the worst movie I've seen at a theater in years. The acting was incredibly sub-par; it seemed almost like a high school play. The overly dramatic one-liners and the overall mediocre characterization of the people in the supermarket made the film laughable, at best. Literally, as we both laughed in shock numerous times throughout the film. The storyline -- well, it's Steven King, so I suppose I shouldn't say anything too bad so as not to offend fans. I guess he's just not my cup of tea, though I didn't expect anything this terrible. Overall, even with the plot aside, I would not recommend this film to anybody with even the slightest good taste in movies."
"capunk2441","2","3","12","1 December 2007"," Cheesy Graphics...Bad Acting...Plot Holes...and a $10 Refund.
","I do have a respect for the accomplishments that Stephen King has done, but ""The Mist"" needed to stay in the vault. The movie is set up great and does a great job of grabbing the audiences' attention and curiosity of what ""lies in the mist."" The movie quickly takes a turn for the worst when the worst display of effects in the history of the big screen were shown with the monster. These effects should not have even been approved for the Sci Fi's channel Movie of the Week.<br/><br/>The movie than tries to move the story along by involving a ""religious fanatic"" prophesying destruction of the world. This side story has no relevance in the movie and just causes irritated noise to the already distressed story.<br/><br/>The end hope is that the whole movie will be saved by a ""Michael Jordan"" ending. However, anyone who has ever seen a Stephen King movie could have predicted how it was going to end. My advice to Mr. King: Continue to keep your visions on paper, and let the film experts transfer it to video.<br/><br/>If you do decide to see this movie, find out what your local theatre's policy is for returns and, if possible, see it during matinée pricing."
"MysteryZombie","10","3","12","23 November 2007"," Truly Amazing.
","Alright so from where i sat this movie was amazing. It stuck really well to the Stephen Kings story until the ending, for those who have read The Mist. I read it maybe a year ago, and loved it. But thats the Novella, to the movie.<br/><br/>The Mist is about a group of survivours who take shelter in a local grocery store, when a mist starts to consume the town and its surrounding area following a large storm. Like any group of people they, begin to divide off into their own smaller groups, some want to stay, others to go, and well some just take comfort in knowing it's Judgement Day. Which is exactly what SK does in his story. If you have ever seen George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead it's much like that but on a larger level based on people. Anyways strange monsters start to come out of the mist that has overrun the town and surrounding area. Now these monsters I thought would look cool and they did just not the way I expected. They had an old school cheesy effect to them, which was awesome, I read somewhere that Stephen King wanted the story to be a kind of drive-in theater type of movie. So cheesy monsters fits there. In the end the movie plays out life (2 or 3 days) in the store, between the groups. The ending I think is much better than SK's rather than leaving it totally open to the reader, its taken in a much more ""Holy Cow"" type ending. I won't give anything away but its good, and in shocking.<br/><br/>The acting is awesome, I love Tom Jane and he didn't disappoint me at all. The rest of the cast was incredible and played their roles very well. The boy who played ""Big Bill"" was amazing, I think he is very talented. The effects again were good. Now a lot of people think this is a jump from your seat horror but its NOT. So don't go in thinking you'll be scared, I read the story and didn't really feel like it was that kind of story where you're intended to be scared.<br/><br/>If you liked the novella, go see this, if you like SK go see this, if you like good cinema go see this. You won't be disappointed at all. For those who have read The Mist, expect a much, much, much different ending. This is where people get mad and say they hate the movie, expect it to be different and see if for what it is.<br/><br/>10/10. One of my favourite movies ever."

","For those of you wanting a slasher movie, this isn't it. This is a really well done thinking persons horror movie that would make even Alfred Hitchcock envious. Not only does it have the obvious in-your-face monsters that everyone expects, it also has the more socially accepted and possibly scarier ones like secret military science projects and religious fanatics. Anyone who watches horror movies knows that the story has to be somewhat believable to be scary, or you walk away with an ""I got ripped off"" feeling. I guarantee you will not have that feeling if you watch this movie, and I also guarantee the feeling you get will stay with you long after you leave the theater."
"kwll-2","10","3","12","22 November 2007"," Amazed
","Got to get this out of my system. If you go to horror/apocalyptic movies looking for happy endings, it's time for that follow-up head examination. One more thing. Religious overtones in the movie were not some contrived addition of the movie's creators. If you read the novella you would realize that Mrs. Carmody and her religious stance are as tantamount to the plot as anything besides the mist itself. After reading some of the bashing comments, I had to make these points because common sense apparently isn't that common and reading with comprehension seems to be a lost art.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, I can say that in the past I have been a fierce defender of Kubrick's deviation from the Shining book in favor of what will work to scare in a movie. I had to do an about face here because I found myself dying to see the story on film the way it was written.<br/><br/>For the most part I did. There were tons of lines that I remembered verbatim from the novella that were faithfully reproduced here. Yes, there were scenes that were not reproduced. Quite a few of them I agree with, because they seemed to have been added into the book for reasons that would not necessarily justify the added length of the movie had they been added.<br/><br/>I was skeptical about Jane as the lead character at first, having remembered him last in The Punisher. I didn't think he could be uncomprehending enough to pull off this role, but he did rather well. I think it could have been done even more convincingly, but it was not a detriment. The other characters, from Amanda to Ms. Carmody to Norm the bag boy to Norton and Mrs. Reppler, were played to perfection by the respective actors. The sense of hopelessness, dread, and fanaticism was played up brilliantly, leading to a truly claustrophobic and harrowing exercise in fear and dread.<br/><br/>The CGI was as good as it needed to be, considering the bizarre creatures that were encountered. And the mist itself was as impossibly white, impenetrable, and oppressive as I had always dreamed it would be if someone decided to make this movie.<br/><br/>The ending? If you're gonna rewrite, this is how it should be done. Bear in mind that I walked into an end of the world film expecting just that. Not expecting some poppycock happy Hollywood template. I got a mind-blower. It was an absolute gut punch, as someone else so accurately put it. Sums up how the mist robbed the characters of their sense of hope and turn the unknown into the insurmountable quite nicely thank you.<br/><br/>I will watch this movie many, MANY more times. And then I will buy the DVD the day it comes out and repeat the process. For the thinker, the movie buff who enjoys the complications and unseen undercurrents that a presented situation contains, this movie can't be missed. If you are looking for Bambi or dark comedy or anything besides dread, fear, and utter hopelessness, do us all a favor. Don't buy the ticket. Nobody likes a whiner - LOL"

Did Darabont think he knows better how to end this story than Stephen King? Darabont's ending SUCKS and is an example of the worst ""Murphy's Law"" tripe. In the book, they are driving into the unknown -- with hope -- with a chance. You never know if they make it out of the mist or run out of gas. A perfect ending which eloquently characterizes the book -- and the mist -- itself.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but this is a failure. Save your money. If you thought you were going to see ""The Langoliers"" -- be prepare to be disappointed."

There are so many horrible films (i.e. The Heartbreak Kid) that I could barely sit through and wish I could've got my money back for, but this one was fully entertaining and one of the true times I actually thoroughly enjoyed myself in a theater. The movie starts off and immediately pulls you in. I don't know what else to say but that it is great. My favorite part of this movie is the ending. It's about time a movie ended with a horrible sad ending!!!!! I thought for sure Thomas Jane was gonna save the day somehow and then the credits were gonna start rolling. It blew my mind. I highly recommend this film. Thanks for reading my opinion."
"suspiria10","9","2","7","25 November 2007"," S10 Review's The Mist (2007)
","One of Stephen King's best tales finally gets a chance at the big screen. Taking point for his fourth King project, Darabont smacks another out of the park. After 'Shawshank', 'Green Mile' and now the 'Mist' I think he shows great command over the great literary world of King.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of small town residents trapped in a supermarket after a massive storm levels the area. But things go weird when a mist engulfs the town and the monsters within threaten to bring the apocalypse.<br/><br/>'The Mist' is an excellent and mostly faithful adaptation. Of course there are tweaks and embellishments here and there most notably a different, darker ending. Darabont assembles an ensemble of recognizable faces (even if you can't quite place a name to them) and several are even King film vets (Thomas Jane from 'Dreamcatcher', Bill Sadler of 'Shawshank Redemption', Jeffrey DeMunn of 'The Green Mile' and Frances Sternhagen of 'Misery' and 'Golden Years'). This gang knows how to pull off King and they do it well. The effects for the most part are excellent the CGI scenes are often helped by the mist but a few of the clear scenes in the market were a bit off. Mix the fine production, acting, atmosphere and more than adequate effects together and you get an adaptation that is faithful to the source and a damn fine scary time at the gigaplex."
"jamhorner","9","2","7","25 November 2007"," A Very Poetic and Disturbing Horror Film
","Of course on first glance many people might think this is a rip off of John Carpenter's The Fog, however as much of a cornerstone The Fog is in American horror, The Mist is more poetic, captivating and emotional then Carpenters' Fog. The top reason why I think this is so is because King just doesn't write about the long going battle between good and evil, but also because he explores the biblical concept of good and evil, paranoia induced fear and how humans quickly turn from civilized people to savages. With a great leading and supporting cast and a money conserving set, this movie, along with The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and The Stand, is one of the best Stephen King adaption in a long time. This is something that I was waiting to see.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden, who plays the town's delusional Catholic believer, is so believable as a Christian tyrant who invokes fear into everybody and who believes that the apocalypse is afoot. With an excellent combination of hand gestures, tone of voice, emotion and feel, she really goes above and beyond with her performance. Thomas Jane, who plays David Drayton the father of Billy Drayton, acts relatively calm throughout this horrible mess. Of course, at points his sedated acting can be too calm when the action and the scene calls for a more panic feel to it (i.e. the garage scene). Though, when the tension rises he puts %110 into his performances. He does a really great job with his character. Besides these characters, there are several great performances by Laurie Holden, Toby Jones (adds comic relief), William Sadler (Green Mile), Frances Sternhagen (Misery) and Nathan Gamble (Babel).<br/><br/>Like many SK novels and novellas, this one had a great religious undertone that works and is proved on more than one occasion. The central biblical themes of the movie is the belief in God and to accept him as our Lord and Savior, as seen on numerous news channels where people beat that concept into young children. The most alarming theme in the film was the idea of sacrifice to prove our devotion that was demonstrated by a very powerful, haunting and disturbing scene in the entire movie. Among these there were other small themes of Catholic ideology and the famous story of betrayal by Judas. All together, they were very good themes that were finally brought up in the most distressing way.<br/><br/>One critic said ""This is the bloodiest movie ever produced."" Obviously he is not an avid horror watcher. Granted, there were a few bloody scenes, but the scariest thing would be the monster attack scenes, mainly because we can't see anything. This movie effectively tacks us back to that ere when horror movies were solely based on imagination and mind over matter, this movie does a great deal to horror. The idea that something is out there in the mist, and we can't see it, we hardly know what it is, it attacks with surprise and fear and you can't do anything about it. Unlike typical ""Mist / Fog"" horror movies, there is no ghost or centralized monster, in this film there are multiple things attacking the store. What's also scary is the idea that you are trapped in a cramped store and you can't escape.<br/><br/>For the most part the camera angles were tight, focusing on the character that is talking, there are occasional wide shots and establishing shots as well. For my taste I think that the tight shots add to the tension and emotion to the movie, it gives you a sense of ""tunnel vision,"" a feeling that your cramped and uncomfortable, a feeling that works very well with the feel of the movie. What I think is amazing is that the wide shots and hand held shots all coincide with the foot market, that everything takes place inside the food mart. Some of the camera angles, for some scenes, were frightening and intimidating. This is a type of cinematography that we rarely see in Stephen King movies.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is ONE of the BEST Stephen King adaptations yet, coming from the guy who brought us the captivating Green Mile and the inspirational Shawshank Redemption, this isn't his best work, but still a very horrid and emotionally torn film. Considering other great Stephen King novels have been butchered by directors (examples: Golden Years, Thinner, Tommyknockers and Desperation), this movie does an excellent job capturing the tension, themes, feel and horror of one of the greatest horror writers ever."
"Kaprice","7","2","7","24 November 2007"," Not what I had expected, but it touched some good points
","** IT MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS ** I cannot give it more than a 7/10 because it wasn't what i had expected. Although there was enough gore in the movie, it wasn't by all means scary as the trailer let me believe...but i'll cut to the point.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a mist. Yes there are various critters around(although you only see about 4 types of them really good). And yes there is a crazy woman saying it is the Apocalypse. But unfortunately she begins to be a bit too annoying by the middle of the movie. I believe the most satisfying moment for the entire crowd watching was when she's removed from the picture. But these are all surface things.<br/><br/>What I came to realize once I was out of the cinema is that the movie actually touched a lot of subjects, some of which are contemporary: religion can be dangerous if misinterpreted, people can be easily manipulated given the right circumstances, the army might have a bit too much power, and that fear can make people lose their minds.<br/><br/>The ending, by itself was totally unpredictable and sad, however once it got by that point(you'll know what i'm talking about) i could almost see what was about to happen in the last 2minutes. It was so unbelievable that it was funny to a certain extend, by I'm sure there wasn't one person in the theater who didn't ask him/herself 'WHY?!?!'.<br/><br/>To conclude, if you go to watch this movie, don't go with any expectations and you could very well enjoy it."
"MLDinTN","7","2","7","24 November 2007"," a horror movie with good character development
","This movie was above average, but I think the ending was too horrible/depressing. Apparently this wasn't the ending in the book, and I think I would have liked the book's ending better. No one wants to think about what David did in the end, especially, to his own son. I mean, couldn't they have at least waited several hours to see if help would come.<br/><br/>Mrs. Carmody was a great character, especially towards the end after she has won over most of the supermarket. She turns into the evil one. I'm glad she got what she had coming when she started saying ""take the boy."" Other people in the store played their roles as well. They just weren't in the background. And with so many people, it was not confusing thanks to a good script.<br/><br/>The blood and gore is more than you usually see in a Stephen King film. That's another plus for me.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: One of the better horror films I've seen in a while. Much better than some slasher flick like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes. Worth seeing."

","""The Mist"" first and foremost finds itself in a rather peculiar position. You see, the novella by Stephen King has been suggested as having inspired the video game ""Silent Hill."" In turn the video game ""Silent Hill"" lead to a movie by the same name. In turn, this adaptation of ""The Mist"" seems to owe a lot of its inspiration to the movie version of the video game ""Silent Hill."" So, if you liked ""Silent Hill"" the movie, its a good bet you'll like ""The Mist."" The story I think has been told before, but here goes: an artist and his wife and child manage to make it through a bad storm. In the aftermath of the damage to the home, the husband and son head into town, taking along the sometime friend sometime foe neighbor to pick up supplies.<br/><br/>While in town, a mist (go figure, eh?) envelopes the store, and a man shouting about something in the mist lead the people inside to close up the doors and remain inside.<br/><br/>As always happens in these movies, first it begins by grabbing one person (the stock boy as he's trying to go out to clear the generator so that it won't backup), and then it has its fill of the neighbor and his band of cynics who venture out to get help.<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, a religious fundamentalist (played admirably by Marcia Gay Harden) recruits the majority inside the store to offer ritual sacrifice to appease the vengeful God that she claims to be representing as a vessel. A minority inside the store plan first to get some medicines from the pharmacy next door, and then finally they plan to leave before the flock turn on them.<br/><br/>The visuals in ""The Mist"" aren't really all that impressive- amongst the creatures inhabiting the mist are large winged insects with sharp stingers, large spiders with webs that burn through clothing and skin, a giant preying mantis like creature, winged creatures that look like a cross between a bat and a dinosaur, tentacles from a creature we never see, and so on. The reality to all of this however is that none of these creatures actually looks real.<br/><br/>Now I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Certainly the way these creatures lay waste to the hapless inside the store is creepy enough, but perhaps if they looked more authentic, the movie might take on a more disturbing tone than it already does.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending, for all the commercials are a buzz about this ending you don't see coming. Having said that, I will say this about the ending: it is one of the most depressing I've seen in a very long time, and it would seem it is also illogical as it plays out.<br/><br/>The movie has a more interesting human component than ""Silent Hill"" did, but its visuals aren't as original (perhaps after the movie ""Silent Hill,"" visuals such as these never will be as original or as authentic) and so its level of creepy allure fades pretty quickly. Its worth a look if you'd like to try your luck with these types of scares, but don't go in expecting the same quality of film as ""The Green Mile"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption."" There's a reason why this film settles for Thomas Jane instead of Tom Hanks."

","Although it has been a very shitty year for horror movies, The Mist is still a great find. The action does not take long to begin and the characters are all great. I'm kind of a sucker for monster flicks, so I was really happy to see that there some very unique and truly disturbing creatures hiding within the mist. Like many Stephen King stories, the best part of watching the film is searching for King's interpretation of the world we live in. This really stands out in The Mist; King deals with religion and thoughts of a coming apocalypse. A lot of people don't like this part of the movie because they view it as ""Christian bashing."" Christians who think that need to calm down and realize that people are not stupid enough to believe that every Christian is like that. And if you are that stupid, well, now you know, and knowing is half the battle. Another thing people are bitching about is the ending. I'll try to say as little as I can about it, but it is amazing. People go to movies and they want what I like to call a ""Hollywood Happy Ending."" The Mist keeps the tone going throughout the entire film. So the ending is as dark and twisted as the rest of the movie."

I was so disappointed with the ending I still can't believe it. I loved the movie until the ending. When the last fifteen- twenty minutes of the movie happen it all goes down hill from there. I can't even explain how disappointed I was with the ending, which was sad and disturbing. I can only hope that the DVD has alternate endings.

"MrGKB","7","2","7","21 November 2007"," I'm not really sure what people were expecting...
","...from a screen version of Stephen King's downbeat novella, ""The Mist,"" but I'm here to tell you that writer/director Frank Darabont doesn't wander very far from the fold of King's vicious little horror. There's going to be plenty of argument about Darabont's altered ending, that's for sure, but the rest of the adaptation is pretty much faithful to the original tale. Expiation, indeed.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is not going to be a popular piece of entertainment like ""The Green Mile"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption."" It's a flat-out nasty horror movie, very similar in spirit (and substance) to George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" and that classic's many cousins and numerous antecedents. It will suffer from not being released when it should have been (can you say Halloween? I knew you could...), although I suspect it'll do reasonably well on home video in the midst of wintry desolation. It's just not what one would call a reaffirming film, and sure as heck isn't joyous holiday fare.<br/><br/>The plot line is slim, as it was in the novella: a group of Maine townspeople are trapped in a grocery store by a preternatural mist within which lurk all manner of otherworldly creatures inimical toward humanity. Our hero, Thomas ""The Punisher"" Jane, heads a capable cast that includes Marcia Gay ""Mystic River"" Harden religiously chewing scenery with fine Piper Laurie/Ellen Burstyn enthusiasm, Laurie ""Silent Hill"" Holden suitably vulnerable as the terrified-but-resilient surrogate wife, Nathan ""Babel"" Gamble equally vulnerable as the terrified-but-not-quite-as-resilient son, along with a host of capable character actors, including William ""Trespass"" Sadler, Toby ""Infamous"" Jones, Frances ""Cheers"" Sternhagen, Alexa ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" Davalos, Chris ""American Pie"" Owen, David ""The Reaping"" Jensen, and Sam ""Battlestar Galactica"" Witwer, whose main purpose is, by and large, to serve up nice, gruesome helpings of monster mash, steaming fresh.<br/><br/>Darabont's script is tight, almost overly so, excising much of the novella's build-up to disaster, despite the two-hour running time, and as mentioned, fairly faithful to the source material, ending notwithstanding. ""The Mist"" has a strong documentary feel to it, due to TV veteran DP Ronn ""Huff"" Schmidt's roving lensmanship and Hunter M. ""I got my start with Darren Lynn Bousman!"" Via's concise editing; Darabont's prudent sculpting of King's pessimistic-yet-hopeful study of ordinary human beings under extraordinary pressure keeps things moving along to the inevitable heartbreaking climax.<br/><br/>I say inevitable because my intuitive opinion is that King's original ending wouldn't have worked cinematically; audiences would have screamed for a more concrete resolution. Darabont's grim finale is right out of the Romero playbook, the one he copied from the ancient tragedies, and drives a deeper nail than King did with his ambiguous fade-out. I suspect King realized as much himself when he publicly favored Darabont's change. The message is still the same: stick together and don't give up hope. Darabont simply offers a pointed reminder of what can happen when hope is lost.<br/><br/>The fx work by CafeFX (along with make-up fx from the ubiquitous KNB Effects Group) is mostly excellent, although in retrospect, I would have liked to have seen a little less of the behemoth monster. Some things really are just better left...indistinct. Visual nods to John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" King's own serial masterwork, ""The Dark Tower,"" and Mike Mignola's ""Hellboy"" will please devoted fanboys, but this is definitely not one for the kiddies, folks, unless you're that brand of monstrous parent that likes to traumatize their brood to ""toughen them up."" KNB and CafeFX serve up plenty of grue, including a horrendous mutant insect sting, some nasty burns, flesh-ripping tentacles, acidic spiders, the odd stabbing, shooting, and garroting, a Lovecraftian crab monster that somehow made me think of ""Starship Troopers,"" and a suitable variety of other creepy-crawlies guaranteed to give children nightmares and make young girls cuddle up to their dates for reassurance.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: decently done adaptation of one of King's more straightforward yarns, but nowhere near as memorable (except for that gut punch finish) as Darabont's other King retellings.<br/><br/>(this review slightly edited after second viewing 11.24.07)"

This film was so strong in the writing that bad special effects did not even tarnish it. As for the ending, WOW. During the last 10 minutes I was a little angry/disappointed - I knew what was coming, and there was no need for this drawn out homage to the survivors, but the rewrite is phenomenal, I'm not saying it was a complete surprise, but the end was so brilliantly crafted that pure empathy was achieved and raw emotion was extracted from an otherwise unbelievable scenario. This is true horror. Not the jumpy scary parts where the violins slowly scale up to a low scratch emphasizing the attack of a monster, but the thought of doing what David does, and what happens after that is horrible.

I have to admit I am always up for something new (if the author is comfortable with it) thus I really appreciate the new ending; it is brave, dark, and creative.<br/><br/>The movie itself has great pacing, moving both slowly (no ghoulies jumping out immediately, making the movie boring after 5 minutes..a la every Wes Craven or John Carpenter movie ever)and quickly in moments of tension. The acting is natural and fluid; the movie is cast with real people (especially if you live in Maine). I find most horror movies terribly boring and tedious, whereas this movie got me pretty riled up. Even the folks in the theater with me got excited. The last time I went to a movie where people applauded was...well...it was a long time ago.<br/><br/>Perhaps what got me the most excited were the many Dark Tower references.

Did the creatures come from Roland's dimension? Was Carmody one of Flagg/Fannin's cronies?

Poor character development is often a weakness of horror films, but here the film creates unlikable characters and then insists on developing them, making sure these unlikable bastards get all the screen time in the world to talk nonsense and make your life miserable as you helplessly sit in the theater seat and scream at the film to kill these characters off already. And then comes the anticlimax and the most unsatisfying ending to a film imaginable. Not only is it unbelievably stupid and illogical, but it makes sure what little emotion you may have had invested by the end of the film was dissipated with a big middle finger to the entire audience. Everything this film did with an intriguing premise was misguided."

","I like being scared and this movie starts off with some good scares,nifty gore and a genuine feeling of fear and high tension. Up to a certain point I was thinking man this is good scary fun and then it degenerates into so much crap starting with the religious psychopath,the endless whiny drivel of certain characters who could not act if their life depended on it.,case in point who the hell cast Thomas Jane?. The movie is rushed to a quick conclusion which is different from the books ending and will leave you really angry. I don't get Stephen Kings comment that the movies ending is the one he wished he had written. If you didn't like the ending Mr King then why write the damn ending you did. IMO, most of Stephen kings adaptations are boring mind numbing crap anyway which tells you about the source material but what really pmo off is that when one of them is actually good, they ruin it with bad acting,badly written dialog and deviate from the source material including changing the ending. Thomas Jane should be banned from acting forever- watch the last few minutes of the movie and you'll see what I mean."

The performances of the supporting actors in the many scenes of fear, panic, and pandemonium are all excellent.<br/><br/>What is not excellent is the dreadful, abominable, nasty anti-human ending.<br/><br/>The credibility of this ""monsters from another reality"" story is handled with such detail, and precision, that the nihilist ending which was seemingly tacked on by a total stranger to the production, was in all senses of the word, PAINFUL. Unbelievable. Dastardly, in fact.<br/><br/>Up to the last few minutes of ""The Mist"" I was ready to give this flick ten out of ten stars, but the savagely inhuman ending scuppered that notion.

The strong, decisive and heroic father decides to execute his friends, the sexy blonde who can barely contain her yearning and desire for him, even as she knows that his wife has been killed by the monsters ? He kills his own son ? It is nonsensical, no, it is worse than nonsensical, it is anti-human.<br/><br/>The character, the action-oriented hero, so brilliantly crafted by the first 9/10ths of the story collapses at the end, just because the car is out of gas and they can still hear the monsters ? What ?? The way ""The Mist"" ends is an abomination in modern American film, a dreadful conclusion to an otherwise magnificently played monster epic. It cancels out the sacrifices made by the other characters, the ones that the heroic artist inspired with his unflagging courage !! I hate this film, now, and any respect I had for the screenwriter or the legion of producers who worked on it, evaporated with the bloody end of this monstrous monster drama. <br/><br/>The principals who cooked that up should be pilloried or horse-whipped or maybe forced to watch ""Legally Blonde"" non-stop over a very long, long week-end.

Well, except for the ""low budget and tight schedule"" thing. Darabont has no feeling of right proportion at all. He lacks it like any FM radio DJ who sits in a wrong chair. Marcia Harden overtakes the plot like some hungry creature from the Mist, making it her own movie inside the movie itself. Thomas Jane looks like he is being lost ""by default"". Not a hero, not a father, but some kind of deeply troubled half-brother who barely knows the kid, but ""takes responsibility"" when needed. The ending sequence with the howling of Lisa Gerrard (Dead can dance), slow-mo ride and four bullets for five people urges the spectator to shoot himself for allowing this half-baked production to get into his mind for more than 2 hours. Because if there is no logic, which was obviously sacrificed for the sake of Ending, then there is a little excuse for such ""adaptation"". It is nerve wrecking for the nerve wrecking sake.

Hostel Part II was bad too, especially with not much of a storyline, just a ""Next Generation"" kind of plot but did have some clever kills so I'll give it credit. Then, there's The Mist. What do we have to say about this film, folks? Honestly, I don't even know where to start bashing this film. The acting is awful, the storyline is unfaithful to the book, and you'll end up wishing The Mist had taken every last member of the cast, including Thomas Jane, who's the only recognizable face in this B-film.

","Being a big fan of the book, I was equal parts excited and worried to see how the screen adaptation would play out. As most novel based movies go, the final product is decent, but not without problems.
First and foremost, the premise of mist harboring an unknown evil is incredibly original and allows for a great character-driven plot to unfold. The acting is all spot on and the music and sound design are some of the most immersive I've seen.
The biggest problem with The Mist is how poorly the CGI holds up. Since the plot needs to be compressed down to a reasonable length, it means the creatures are seen more than they otherwise would, which makes the technical problems all the more apparent. The compression of the plot didn't bother me that much since I was already familiar with the characters, but people who haven't read the book might be overwhelmed with the amount of stuff happening at times.
While not a perfect adaptation, The Mist is still an enjoyable movie experience for fans of thrillers."

","This horror movie about isolated people in a grocery facing unknown horrors outside is the opposite of what Stephen King usually does.
Generally, King captures three dimensional characters, or at least attempts to give ""credible characters in incredible situations"" more than most Hollywood writers.
But here we get the opposite. These characters don't even come close to being one dimensional. They're simply seen from a demon possessed point of view of one person.
This one simply rationalizes how the others behave. They don't behave in any realistic way, though he tries to look calm.
It's obvious that this character is a true human monster simply deciding how others act out of his own convenience for the Hell he wants the world to be.
Trouble is that the makers of this movie don't make that clear enough for the feeble minds already totally brainwashed by Western culture's dark ages of Psychiatry, and that means this movie is part of the problem, not the solution."

Not often do you find a horror movie with an ending that can live up to the perfection of the rest of the film, but THE MIST does just that. Another excellent part of the movie was the build up/tension. It really does put you in a specific world and it keeps you engaged with the characters and the problems facing them. A great part about this movie is the characters however. The way each character is displayed in comparison to each other is genuine and intriguing.

David and Billy and their neighbour Brent Norton go into town. There they discover that the mist contains some frightening creatures, creatures intent on killing humans.<br/><br/>A so-so horror movie, directed and written by Frank Darabont and based on a novel by Stephen King. Darabont's first two movies were brilliant and among the best films of the 1990s. I am, of course, referring to The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. In 2001 he directed The Majestic, also superb, yet criminally underrated. <br/><br/>Unlike his first two movies, The Majestic was not based on a Steven King novel and was not written by Darabont. For The Mist, his fourth (and, to date, last), he goes back to his original formula -<br/><br/>adapt and direct a Stephen King book/short story.<br/><br/>The result is not close to being in the same league as his first three movies. Largely a common-or-garden creature-horror film, this has nothing of the depth of those three movies. There are a few interesting themes - mob mentality and religious zealousness to the fore - but these are at best tertiary to the horror-thriller element.<br/><br/>The plot is not helped by some incredibly irritating characters and a general feeling of disengagement.<br/><br/>Due to the themes, ends up slightly better than your average horror movie, but that doesn't say much.

"zkonedog","9","1","3","7 March 2017"," Monsters vs. Human Nature: Which Is Worse?
","At its core, ""The Mist"" (based on the Stephen King novella) is a classic ""humans trying to survive against monsters"" tale. However, thanks to King's brilliant storytelling, a human element is introduced into the mix that takes the film to new psychological heights.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Mist"" tells the tale of a small American town suddenly attacked by a variety of bug-like creatures. After a terrible windstorm causes the town's residents to gather in the general store for supplies, they all find themselves trapped in the rather confined space as a curtain of mist blankets the entire city. Whenever someone ventures out into the mist, however, they do not return alive.<br/><br/>There are two reasons why this film is so interesting/entertaining:<br/><br/>First, the special effects and alien creatures will have you on the edge of your seat. One almost has to wonder if they did not inspire JJ Abrams' creature in the later ""Cloverfield"" picture, as the films are very similar in that regard.<br/><br/>What truly sets the film apart, though, is that it is as much about humanity as it is about monsters. As the bewildered townspeople struggle to determine their next move, all their personalities begin showing in crisis mode. There is the religious zealot, the rednecks ready to fight at the drop of the hat, the natural leaders, and the ""lemmings"" willing to follow the loudest voice in a mob-like mentality. In typical King fashion, it is a tale of humanity's struggles more than the paranormal aspect.<br/><br/>Overall, then, ""The Mist"" is a great ""monster flick"" also including large doses of human drama. It was a great Stephen King story, and the transfer to the big screen is almost impeccable. Unless you are a bit squeamish, you will find this interesting on both the ""horror"" & ""psychological"" levels."
"scorfield-51711","5","1","3","15 September 2016"," 'There's Something in the Mist'
","""Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another. Why do you think we invented politics and religion?""<br/><br/>There are many worse Stephen King adaptations which have failed to translate effectively to the big screen, and though this production fares better, ultimately it disappoints. With such a lauded track- record in having previously brought King novellas to a cinema audience, Frank Darabont appeared to be the ideal choice to repeat his success here. Yet, though this constituted a virtual 'labour of love' for the director, his adaptations to date had not been from the author's signature works of horror, and there are occasions when this becomes apparent. Darabont had been waiting to film this short- story for twenty years, and was so committed to his alternate ending that he even rejected a studio offer that would have doubled his eventual budget, unprepared as he was to accept the caveat that his ending be sacrificed. One consequence of a more limited budget may help explain why the standard of CGI effects would prove so underwhelming. This is unfortunate given the level of suspense created by the fear of the 'unknown' terrors lurking in the mist enveloping the rural Maine community. One wonders whether the director's desire to release a black and white version was in part driven by an attempt to mask the poor quality of the film's special effects. However, it is an appealing proposition as it would identify this production more closely with the'B-movies' of the fifties with which it shares many characteristics. What is clear to this reviewer is that much of the criticism levelled at this movie can be attributed to a failure to capitalise on the initial frisson of fear and imagined horror at the spectral presence beyond the curtain of mist. Darabont should have more closely followed the dictum of psychological thrillers in 'less is more'. This approach he apparently, and successfully, did when taking on board the advice of cast member, Andre Braugher, to ditch explanatory scenes behind the genesis of the eerie mist and its hidden hordes. In terms of the acting on display, the cast of terrified townspeople trapped within the confines of the local supermarket feature several of the director's regular actors, all of whom deliver reliable performances. There is also solid support from the likes of the aforementioned Braugher and Toby Jones, with even Thomas Jane, counter to this reviewer's expectations, proving to be effective as the reluctant hero. However, the film's standout performance is that of Marcia Gay Harden as the messianic religious zealot, Mrs Carmody, convinced that the horrors outside have been sent to wreak retribution on the sinful human race. Overall, though, there is a lack of character development which undermines the movie's aim of illustrating how individuals exposed to the highest levels of fear and stress can subvert their rational thought processes. One result of this has been many reviewers questioning the plausibility of the depth of loyalty shown to Mrs Carmody's apocalyptic fervour. In this respect, the film would have benefited from taking more time to establish a greater sense of desolation and despair, as the promptness of conversion of the majority of the trapped townspeople lacks a certain degree of plausibility. Returning to Darabont's chosen ending, though King has himself stated his wish that he had ended his novella in the same fashion, it is not as satisfying as it could have been. As opposed to the original work's open ending, there can be no question that the film's bleak final act of desperation fails to wholly convince. Having fought so much to defend his son and neighbours, Jane's character's actions to save them from a far worse fate arrives at a juncture where such hopelessness and despair still appears rash. The director's decision to incorporate the haunting track of the 'Host of the Seraphim' by the artist the 'Dead Can Dance' was inspired but could have added to the ambiance of fear and despair if it had been used as a recurring musical motif throughout. Overall, a missed opportunity where Darabont could have focused more on his consummate skills in concentrating more on investigating the paranoia and in-fighting which blight our more reasoned responses to fear and danger."

Simple plot regards a mist that invades a town and a group of people trapped in a supermarket from some unknown creature bent on making this an unpleasant shopping experience. From there everyone becomes fast food because they are too stupid to remain alive. This film might have been much more interesting had the mist in question just been someone's bad bout of diarrhea and stench. They could solve the plot at the light of a match. That might have solved this plot to had anyone had the decency to burn the script. Frank Darabont does his best and is aided by special effects that are mainly enclosed by the mist. Darabont has made far superior films such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Majestic. Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, and Andre Braugher are the bunt of a bad joke here. Nobody in this travesty is in for a very happy ending and that is the film's final disappointment.

"petarmatic","7","1","3","14 March 2014"," What a horror!
","I liked this horror film. It was very interesting and innovative, with a lot of interesting twists and turns.<br/><br/>Plot is interesting, it is not of course about mist but rather about the people and their acting in the stressful and unpredictable situations. It really well portrayed how some people can not handle these kinds of situations. Especially is interesting religious woman. When people have no escape they revert to religion. When they can not explain unexplainable they revert to religion. All the time there is someone who will try to escape that way, however the only escape she achieved was that a bullet came into her head.<br/><br/>Acting is different from an actor to another actor. I will not single anyone out, because they succeeded to work well as a crowd.<br/><br/>All in all if you like Stephen King, like I do, you should see this film. It is a lot of entertainment."
"grobu-fr","7","1","3","15 January 2013"," Morally disturbing
","Though everything has been said more or less about the Mist, and its ending, I'd like to have a go at it. I find it disturbing in various respects, which is probably fulfilling the director's intent. More terrifying than gore and monsters is the desecration of a father's promise to his son. The boy is the embodiment of what is sacred to most humans, an innocent being to love and protect at all cost. Killing him for fear he might die of a more horrible kind of death, is a first bitter and deeply unsettling step in the desecration. Realising that this gesture of despair came at the wrong moment, when the boy could have escaped this nightmare and live on, is a twisted irony, a tragedy in which viewers' empathy is being cruelly played with. A wicked fate is making fun of the price the father paid to ""protect"" his son, the highest and most painful price a parent could possibly pay. For nothing.<br/><br/>But there's more.<br/><br/>I can't help wondering what happened to the folks at the store. It can very well be that they have been liberated by the army, and that that bunch of sordid bigots were on the happy-ending side of the movie. I suspect there is a kind of subtext bringing a most unexpected support to Mrs Carmody's character. As someone pointed out earlier, why does the monster mosquito spare her at the last moment? Why does she die in a graceful kind of ways, almost like a martyr? Why does it feel that her ""prophecies"" have been fulfilled, that all the lives she claimed during her religious hysteria, have indeed been sacrificed? At the moment fear and tension rise past the fragile boundaries set by reason and civilisation, the movie stages what looks like a straightforward opposition between rationalism and mysticism. Proponents of the latter, confronted with events and creatures beyond their understanding, set out to force a religious explanation on it, as if whatever uncontrollable form of danger to mankind were the manifestation of a heinous god, only to be resolved by submission and sacrifices, in the same backward kind of ways that Mayans in Apocalypto sacrifice local tribes to win their gods' favour. At the opposite, Drayton stands as the embodiment of the hero, the reasonable, courageous and enlightened one. But the ending destroys everything and reverses the values. Destiny spits in the hero's face and seems to side up with the Old Testament worshipping lunatics : the monsters are gone after the sacrifice has been completed. That is even more disturbing. And disgusting.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, I'd say the Mist, literally, is probably a metaphor about the unknown, or about crisis situations, when there are no guidelines anymore, and the human mind is at a loss how to explain and what to do. But also, the mist illustrates the elusive nature of destiny. What will become of us, what is ahead? Choices are prompted by circumstances and assumptions, but nobody can read fate."
"Drahadis","5","1","3","26 September 2012"," Good but I didn't like the ending
","Mostly the movie gets good marks for plot, characters, suspense, suspense, etc. All good marks. You genuinely care about the characters and what happens to them, mostly. The special effects are also good.<br/><br/>BUT, in the past... I dunno... I guess ten years maybe? The movie industry has gotten so damn brooding and depressing! Every time I watch a movie like this one, it nearly ALWAYS ends in tragedy! What the hell ever happened to the hero prevailing (even if its by a small margin) in the end, and teaching people to fight for survival and maybe you'll come out alive in the end with your loved ones at your side? I'm getting tired of this crap, its getting old and I for one am totally sick of it.<br/><br/>An abundance of tragedies where all the characters you care about die in the end and/or the hero is doomed to a lifetime of everlasting sorrow and depression, is a fad. I get it. But I don't want to see it anymore, its depressing! Why is everyone so damn melancholy and brooding?! I've had enough to last me a life time. PLEASE someone bring back the traditional hero who wins in the end and saves his family and friends! But you know, make them work harder for it. Don't make it easy on them. ;) I'd also like to mention, I loved the message in this movie about how dangerous and destructive religion is and how when the world falls apart, those who are very religious are always the first to go nuts, cause violence, and make matters worse for those who are just trying to survive and keep their families safe. Religion preys on those of weak character/intelligence and paranoid, and this movie really shined a light on that. For that I give it an extra point.<br/><br/>In summery, the movie gets good points all around for all the important stuff, but this movie falls into the fad of depressing tragedies that is turning me off from movies of this genre all together, so that takes off about 3 points from the 8 I originally was giving it. Then one bonus point for a positive lesson. So I give it a slightly above average score of 6 out of 10."
"aweidenhammer","4","1","3","17 September 2012"," Darabont... what the hell?
","I'm not against tragedy, but I am against idiotic character turns. They have proved themselves savvy survivors throughout the entire film. Then I am supposed to believe they give up and shoot themselves? They never try to get any gas? I feel like the ending was an abrupt surrender to find an end to a generally overlong film. It's sad that a 5 minute ending can ruin an otherwise good horror movie, but it does it so effectively by destroying respect for someone that has been built up as heroic. You might argue that the turn has a purpose. Maybe the sight of his wife tipped him over the edge. But at least make that clear. He's fighting for his son for days, then shoots him. That is just dumb. It's also not King's intention. In the book, they actually do get more gas. It makes me angry that I wasted my time on these characters... and sad that Darabont wasted his."
"Buddy-51","6","1","3","30 July 2012"," standard monster movie with a slightly elevated tone
","Essentially an unaccredited remake of John Carpenter's ""The Fog,"" ""The Mist"" is a 50's style B-monster-movie done with 21st Century special effects. It's the oldie about a group of random strangers trapped in an enclosed space - in this case, a local supermarket - while some unknown threat lurks in the world outside. But because it's based on a Stephen King novella, it comes with a veneer of deep-think philosophizing to make it seem better than it actually is.<br/><br/>It all begins when a strange mist rolls into a small New England town, harboring within it a menace of an indescribable and deadly nature. Local artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the requisite everyman character who becomes the agreed-upon leader who helps the people trapped in the store cope with the crisis.<br/><br/>For the most part, this is standard-issue stuff, with each of the stock characters falling into his or her assigned role - be it the soon-to-be-proved-wrong skeptic, the soon-to-be-cut-down-to-size (in some cases, quite literally) big-mouth braggart, and the curled-up-in-a-fetal-position quivering jellyfish, among others. Heck, there's even an annoying scripture-spouting end-of-days religious fanatic (deliciously played by an over-the-top Marcia Gay Harden) who gets on everyone's last nerve, and who is really just the crazy ornithologist and her drunken detractor from the diner scene in ""The Birds"" rolled into one and then writ large.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is filled with people doing and saying some truly unlikely and stupid things, but the second half has a bit more bite to it as it explores the ways in which desperate people will turn on one another through fear and superstition, and, in so doing, become a greater threat to their own survival and safety than the thing outside. But its bleak, oh-so-predictable ""ironic"" ending makes us pine for the days when ""The Twilight Zone"" managed to do this sort of thing on a weekly basis with a whole lot less hyperventilation and fanfare."
"Scarlet_Syndicate","8","1","3","13 March 2012"," Could the ending be any crueler?
","I watched this the year it came out and sad to say I was really disappointed in it. However, a few years later I decided to give it a second chance and I loved it! I don't know what I missed the first time around but this was great. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, I haven't read the actual book even though I am a fan of Stephen Kings work but now this will definitely be on the list to check out. I'm not sure if its a good adaptation of the book but it seems like it and to a high quality (film makers have it out to turn Stephen Kings work into a pile of rubbish, The Shining was possibly the worst film I have ever seen.) Frank Darabont is an absolute genius and the acting was to a really high standard(especially Laurie Holden and Tom Jane), although it did seem like it contained the entire The Walking Dead cast which I guess we didn't know at the time it was released. <br/><br/>A few qualms I have with this storyline however is the explanation of the alternate reality, I guess it works fine but it just wasn't my cup of tea. The other thing was the absolutely ludicrous soundtrack for the last 15 minutes of the movie. It took all of my power not to mute it. The ending was good but as I say, could it have been any more crueler? I guess though that's what you expect from a horror movie. Kudos!"
"shinzou_morimoto","7","1","3","5 December 2011"," A Wonderful Concept That Ends Up Being Absurd
","Note: Before going any further, I did not read the short story this movie is based off. I am only concerned with the story in the movie, and nothing else. Secondly, there be spoilers here....Argh!<br/><br/>The Acting: The cast is half way decent, with familiar faces to King and Darabont films. The acting is generally solid, though interactions between some characters felt hollow, like David and his wife in the beginning (did not portray a believable couple). <br/><br/>The Story: The US Government accidentally allows another dimension to seep into ours, quickly covering the immediate world in a dense mist. In the mist, monsters await the unlucky and foolish. The occupants of a supermarket lock themselves in, and the fear and stress of the situation, eventually peels back the veneer of polite society, revealing the monsters under the skin. Soon a microcosm of humanity is played out in the store.<br/><br/>Cool concept. Unfortunately though, the confines of time in the movie, ultimately bring this story down. The characters emotional stress and reactions to the people and world around them, is too rushed and thus silly. Some examples:<br/><br/>1. The Dan Miller character, played by a King and Darabont favorite, Jeff DeMunn(Green Mile, Storm of the Century, etc.), bursts into the supermarket in the early parts of the movie, warning of danger outside. The occupants reactions to a possible threat outside is normally realistic, but plays out much too quickly. Peoples reactions are normally somewhat slow and ponderous, but in this movie, they all immediately assume that Dan Miller is absolutely correct, and they all immediately start screaming at his entrance into the store with a small bloody nose. The reactions of the people, are too immediate, there is no realistic build up, and thus it comes off as somewhat silly. The way Dan's entrance was played out in the movie, you would have thought he came running in with a monster attached to his back, his eye balls ripped out, and a hole in his chest the size of a basketball. <br/><br/>2. The Jim character, played by William Sadler, is quick to open up about his personal dislike of the main character, only minutes after the supermarket closes itself to the outside world. During a part in the store room of the supermarket, Jim becomes immediately petty and resentful of the main character David, and proceeds to let him know that he doesn't think much of people who have gone to college. This wouldn't have felt unrealistic, if the characters had been stuck in the store for a day or more, scared and stressed out. However, because it happens only minutes after the Dan Miller character enters the store, it comes off as too quick.<br/><br/>There are many more examples of these super quick explosions of emotion, throughout the movie. They would not be out of place, if the story played out over the course of a week or longer. Unfortunately, the movie tries to tell the history of the world in under two hours, and thus everything is super accelerated, with no attempt to make the time in the store seem to go on longer. The events in the story play out in what appears to be two days, had it made it play out over a longer period of time, the reactions of the characters wouldn't be so silly.<br/><br/>Continuing this idea of rushed time, the ending of the movie becomes quite absurd.<br/><br/>The Ending: David, his son, Amanda, Dan, and Irene, are the five characters who manage to flee the store and acquire a mode of transportation. With the intent to get out of the mist, they leave the store and decide to drive as far as the tank of gas in the vehicle will allow them. Ultimately they run out of gas, still within the mist. They sit there for only a few minutes, before it is decided that they will use a gun on themselves. David shoots the other four occupants, but is unable to kill himself as he doesn't have any more bullets. He gets out of the vehicle, obviously distressed, and as he waits for the monsters in the mist to kill him, a horrible surprise appears from the mist. Survivors in the form of the military, complete with guns, tanks, and even a flame thrower.<br/><br/>This couldn't have been a more absurd ending. It was unrealistic, both in the sense of time, and in the sense of the characters. These characters risked life and limb to flee the store, risked it again to get to the vehicle, and further risked it by taking a road trip. They showed a clear drive for survival, but the moment the vehicle ran out of gas, they decided within minutes to kill themselves, rather then try to either: wait in the vehicle for a few hours to see what would happen outside; try to brave the mist to find shelter. The lack of realism should be obvious here.<br/><br/>1. They were survivors. As stated previously, they showed a clear and strong will to live. <br/><br/>2. They did not encounter any problems driving around the world, thereby showing that just because the immediate world was covered in this mist, did not mean it was instant death to be outside in it. If they traveled a hundred miles without being attacked, then clearly the amount of monsters in the mist, was not as dense as the mist itself. <br/><br/>3. Despite the above, they took only minutes to decide that suicide was a better alternative to waiting around in the vehicle, and/or attempting to find safe haven outside of the vehicle. Realistically, coming to the decision to kill yourselves, with all of the above put in perspective, would not have been a five minute conversation.<br/><br/>Grade: 7 out of 10"
"pinkseashell09","8","1","3","3 November 2011"," I watch this once a week, can't get enough
","This must be my all time favorite movie. I went into the theater thinking eh another lame story about spooky creatures in a mist. Boy was I wrong. Yes there are creepy things going on, what the best part of the film was it never explains to you where they came from and why or what they are. That sense of mystery really stuck with me. The sense of the people in the store having no control, being in denial by refusing to believe that whats outside is dangerous. I LOVED the role of Mrs. Carmody(The preacher) Even though I am not religious but it brings me back to when I read the book of Lord of the Flies. When people are stranded together without rules, with fear and no way out humans panic and look for any possible answer to save themselves. This movie brought out the same message from the lord of the flies novel. However, it was more gory and intense. The drama was well fitting, the character development was great moving and I was able to sympathize with everyone even the preacher. I understood their actions and ultimately I understood the actions the father took about his soon in the last scene. I don't know if I could have done what he did but either way i still see the main character Mr. Drayton as the hero in the story since he tried to so hard to save everyone. Once the fog lifts by the end and you see what is really going on and knowing that the Hero can't turn back the clocks to choose a different direction of home, you feel miserable and sad for the hero sincere gave up everything and now he is left with nothing. HOWEVER, it left me with the simplistic message of NEVER EVER GIVE UP. No matter what we must face death and we can;t take the easy way out because there is no easy way. I felt deeply for the hero and his family, and all those lost in the grocery store. It was imaginative, spiritually lifting, great script and lots of suspense with no boring bits at all. Defiantly give this movie a go! I love it and I can honestly never get bored of it@"
"Wuchakk","8","1","3","28 October 2011"," Good monsters, great ending, cartooney social commentary, truly thought-provoking
","THE STORY: A strange mist falls upon a Maine village where numerous townspeople hold up in a supermarket. Within the mist lurks strange insect-like creatures, big and small. Two groups slowly develop within the market: 1.) The sane group who just want to work together and survive and 2.) The increasingly-lunatic apocalypse mongers.<br/><br/>Let me first address what doesn't work, and then we'll look at the film's many positives: <br/><br/>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The initial set-up of the story is fine until about the 35-minute mark when I started rolling my eyes at the character stereotypes and their unbelievable actions. For instance, Thomas Jane's black neighbor is ridiculously paranoid of imagined slights and it's just not believable.<br/><br/>Then there's the clichéd self-righteous, hate-mongering, doomsday-obsessed ""Christian"" played by Marcia Gay Harden. I'm not saying people like this wacko don't exist (after all, Jesus plainly stated ""There will be false prophets; you'll recognize them by their fruits""), it's just that she doesn't come off believable. She also lacks the charismatic flair necessary to convert half of the people to her lunatic fringe.<br/><br/>These are just two examples; there are more cartooney stereotypes that tempted me to tune out, the worst being when the wacko group attempts to sacrifice a guy. It was dumb, but I persevered on the grounds that the people in the store are a microcosm of the American melting pot. Hence, most of the people are TYPES rather than realistic individuals.<br/><br/>Another negative is that a full 90-minutes of the 2-hour runtime takes place IN the supermarket (or adjoining pharmacy), which gives the film a confined vibe. The good news is that the ending is truly worth the wait.<br/><br/>WHAT WORKS: The explanation given for the mist and the creatures is surprisingly plausible.<br/><br/>Some have criticized that all the characters are unlikable, but this simply isn't true. For instance, Thomas Jane is a good protagonist. All hell's literally breaking loose but he keeps his head at all times.<br/><br/>There are numerous other likable characters like the beautiful Laurie Holden who plays the schoolteacher Amanda. Amanda is truly spiritual, full of love, mercy and compassion. She's the antithesis of the Pharisaical Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). For instance, Carmody goes on and on with her religious blather and Amanda simply responds, ""You're too Old Testament."" <br/><br/>Amanda wouldn't say this unless she was familiar with the differences between the Old and New Testaments. This would indicate that she's likely a Christian of some sort, which is substantiated by her truly loving spirit (not that non-Christians can't be loving, just that agape love is the core fruit of the Christian faith, which is why Jesus taught that false prophets can be plainly recognized by their lack of this fruit ~ Matthew 7:15-23. Agape love is one-and-the-same as the ""fruit of the spirit"" detailed in Galations 5). Why do I point this out? Because it's tempting for Christians to write off ""The Mist"" due to the character of Mrs. Carmody, who doesn't paint Christianity in a very positive light, to say the least.<br/><br/>But, again, Jesus said there would be people like this, and there ARE. They're counterfeits. Notice during Mrs. Carmody's solo prayer in the bathroom where she essentially boasts of herself to God, a definite Pharisaical trait. Amanda then enters the restroom, full of love and understanding. Carmody responds with venomous, horribly insulting words, a clear indication that she's not truly what she claims to be.<br/><br/>I'm a Christian and am therefore in contact with believers all the time and I can honestly tell you that the majority of Christians don't even remotely resemble Mrs. Carmody. Most Christians in my social circles sincerely walk in love and try to serve God even while they're flawed human beings who have weaknesses and make mistakes. And, yet, there are some hateful legalistic zealots like Mrs. Carmody. One woman I know insists on being addressed as ""Apostle Harris"" at all times, even though she's not an apostle in the remotest sense. She's got to be one of the most joyless, unkind, hostile people I've ever met (she once ""rebuked"" me for not praying over a cupcake!!!), yet she masquerades as a supposed Christian leader. Nothing could be further from the truth. She's false, pure and simple.<br/><br/>As noted above, the story starts to feel overly confined due to the one-dimensional setting, but the climax is truly worth the wait (NO SPOILERS). At about the 1 hour and 45 minute mark the film takes on a truly mysterious and awe-inspiring vibe as a handful of people escape into the foreboding mist. The score at this point becomes equal parts ominous, beautiful and otherworldly.<br/><br/>The potent ending is controversial. Some hate it but it makes a powerful point: Never give up hope because you never know how close you are to the dawn.<br/><br/>FINAL ANALYSIS: I highly recommend seeing ""The Mist."" Even though it recalls other horror films, it possesses its own uniqueness. Yes, some of the characterizations are cartooney and contrived, but -- again -- the characters are a microcosm of multicultural society. Besides the ending is incredible (even if you oppose one certain aspect) and the story truly is thought-provoking. It successfully provokes the viewer to ponder long afterwards. My wife and I had a nice long discussion on the various social/religious issues and other points. This is a sign of a very worthwhile picture despite its obvious dumb elements.<br/><br/>GRADE: Borderline B+ or A-"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","3","30 April 2011"," Humanity Lost In The Mist
","Frank Darabont's surprisingly layered science fiction horror film 'The Mist' is one of the most impressive of its in recent times. Now I say surprising because most of the film adaptations that I have seen of King's novels haven't translated well on screen (with the exception of a few like 'Christine').<br/><br/>Grabbing the viewer's attention from the very beginning, 'The Mist' starts off as a tribute to the many cult classic monster flicks. An unidentified object threatens a small town who keep themselves locked in a supermarket. As the object reveals itself, panic builds. Many of the characters are clichéd caricatures that one has so often witnessed in the cult classics. As the monster begins to show itself and the characters and as entertaining as the movie is, I thought it would be just another monster attacks the city flick. But just at that moment 'The Mist' plunges into new and deeper depths.<br/><br/>I think one reason why this movie received so little recognition is because it gave the impression of being just another typical genre film. It's a shame that this wasn't given much of a chance because it raises some profound questions about humanity that one would rather ignore than confront. After the final scene, one is left with an unsettling feeling as it has one of the most depressing (but least predictable) endings (and I couldn't think of a better one as a happy ending would have been less impactive).<br/><br/>The only flip side was theme of religion. The Marcia Gay Harden track is obviously crucial and raises issues that are parallel to today's world conflicts especially religious fanaticism. However, it also gives the impression that all religious people feel that way or a vulnerable to such manipulation. I wish there was some focus on at least one religious character who opposed Mrs. Carmody's ways. There is only one sentence with a biker where he delivers a line to Mrs. Carmody...and is then disposed of. What I'm saying is that I would have liked to see some conflict within the religious context and point out why being religious isn't a bad thing and that fanaticism is.<br/><br/>I'll stop here as the issues the film raises are best discovered by the viewer. Now, on the technical side, 'The Mist' is exceptionally well made. While some argue that the special effects weren't anything amazing amazing, I couldn't disagree more. The film is a tribute and thus it isn't meant to look like another 'Avatar' but even otherwise, I thought it looked very good. The cinematography is remarkable and the minimal use of a background score is very effective. Darabont highly succeeds in creating an atmosphere of danger, fear, isolation and despair.<br/><br/>All the actors perform superbly. Even those who were given roles that are clichés, play them well and succeed in evoking frustration. But of course, the ones that shine are Thomas Jane (as the dad in despair), Laurie Holden (this kind of cinema isn't anything new to her- cough cough - 'The X Files', 'Silent Hills' and now 'The Living Dead'), Marcia Gay Harden (see for yourself to know what I mean) and Toby Jones (the mediator).<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the trailer, the premise or poster. 'The Mist' is far more than what one would expect it to be. It won't bring a smile to your face after the hopeless final scene following the rolling closing credits, but you'll have had the experience of something much better than what this genre of films usually has to offer."
"jb_campo","5","1","3","26 April 2011"," Hate it when they change the ending!
","I recently read the novel so I thought I'd take a chance and watch the film. IMDb gave it a decent rating as did Netflix. The movie moved along nicely, with suspense about this mist, the quirky neighbor, the father-son relationship, etc. When the entities in the mist started doing their thing, I found that very well done. Little by little the director revealed what the poor people were dealing with. And when they ventured into the drug store next door, wow, now that was scary. Everything was moving along nicely, with the crazy church lady taking control over the group slowly but surely. <br/><br/>But then, poof, the ending fell flat. Spoiler alert. Why why why did the director change the ending? In the novel, as I recall, no one committed suicide. There was the faint hope of heading towards Hartford because of something the father heard on the radio. But in the movie. 4 people commit suicide, including the father killing his own son? How does the director justify this, when all these people had done for the entire movie was fight for themselves, then at the end, they stop? They kill themselves 5 minutes after running out of gas? Didn't make sense. The ending sucked. The ending spoiled the whole movie for me. The ending destroyed all hope you had, when that was NOT the intent at all in the novel. Hence, my 5/10. <br/><br/>I hate it when they change the ending!"

The creatures on the outside or the crowd trapped in the store, who are becoming more frustrated and more segregated as the film goes on.<br/><br/>This film harks back to horror movies and claustrophobic thrillers such as Dawn of Dead and The Fog, with everyday people just trying to get back to their loved ones or to escape their makeshift prison. Jane is great as the everyman who is trying to keep everything under control whilst looking after his son.<br/><br/>There are obvious connotations to religion and how people can be brainwashed by someone in an hour of weakness/desperation, and this plays a vital role to the scariest part of the film, the crowd of the new 'cult' just keeps getting bigger and bigger, and begin to play god by believing that they will keep the creatures at bay by sacrifice.<br/><br/>Some of the CGI is very bad though, and knocks a point of the film for me, but to balance it out, there is a lot of needed humour in the film at surprising points to give you a little lift before the ending.<br/><br/>And what an ending. if you've seen it, you will know where i'm coming from. If you haven't seen the film and don't really like the sound of it, see it just for the ending, the last 2 minutes are priceless.<br/><br/>So apart from some very bad CGI, this film is a must, heavily overlooked on its initial release, but worth seeing now."

Sure the acting is not the best nor is the ""correctness"" of the various technicalities as is pointed out by various others.<br/><br/>But what the movie wants to say I think it does pretty convincingly, the way people react when scared, the way we humans try to seek comfort and it is incredibly well done.<br/><br/>The best part of it is the way every character was flawed in this movie, where every person had a bad as well as a redeeming quality and I think this is where a lot of the mainstream audience got confused.<br/><br/>Honestly, I have seen so many horror movies pre-approved by others - and seriously very few movies ever will be better than this one.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: WATCH THIS FILM.<br/><br/>P.S. TO PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE THIS ONE, I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT DO YOU EXPECT OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE!"

","Solid movie, fun to watch!<br/><br/>Don't expect anything great of it. The actors do their jobs well, the script is good, except for the usual plot holes to be expected in such movies.<br/><br/>The major plot hole would be, the army base. Unexplainable gas-like mist containing murderous beasts and an army base nearby where top secret research is done. Yet it takes the cast one and a half hours (or rather one and a half days) to suspect, that those two could be connected. They rather gather around the town madwoman and listen to her babbling about the apocalypse.<br/><br/>And, of course, as is seen in EVERY movie of this sort, a bunch of people try to get help for a wounded guy, who will die anyway, and some of them won't make it back.<br/><br/>Other than that, nice movie. Nothing new, though."
"zfiany","7","1","3","10 November 2009"," Stephen King's The Mist
","A movie is usually referred to by the Director's movie but this doesn't apply to Stephen King's works. When you watch an adaptation of Stephen King, you gotta give the credit to the right man.<br/><br/>I agree with one of the viewers that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best of King's adaptation and ""The Green Mile"" is definitely a good movie but we need to be fair about one thing. The Green Mile is so similar to a movie that was released in 1995 called ""Powder"" while ""The Green Mile"" was written in 1999. I enjoyed ""The Green Mile"" but not as much as everybody else did because I had already watched ""Powder"".<br/><br/>Anyhow, back to The Mist. I have to make it clear that the creatures in the movie were not really that scary but the idea of the world ending this way is possible and scary. Just the idea of being prisoned in one place and not knowing what the h'll is going on out side and even if you go out and see that there is no evidence of life anymore, is so damn scary. I loved the movie and enjoyed it a lot as it had so many strong elements. I usually enjoy the horror movies that group bunch of people who don't know each others in one place where they try with their different characters to save their lives. I also like it how people split into believing what's going on and others being just skeptical about the whole idea.<br/><br/>The character of the religious lady is just so smart and the ending of the movie though shocking and disturbing but beautiful and you wouldn't have liked it to be different even though."

","I was... baffled after I was done watching this movie!<br/><br/>The mist, which is originally a short story written by Stephen King, is a story about a small town near the mountains. At night, there is a terrible storm and there is a lot of damage. The day after, a strange mist descends down on the town, covering it completely. It soon becomes clear that inside the mist houses a terrible evil. The survivors run to safety and end up in a supermarket, where they have to fight for their lives or die trying...<br/><br/>That sounds like your average horror movie, doesn't it? HOWEVER! Unlike most horror movies, the Mist has a lot of characters who you will either hate or love. Wonderful, believable acting makes this film more appealing.<br/><br/>The CGI is GOOD! Really good! It was nice to see a movie with some good, scary effects.<br/><br/>There is gore in this movie. Sometimes even gross gore. So this movie ain't for the weak of heart. (or you can just close your eyes or turn away at the most intense parts).<br/><br/>And then there's the ending... my god... I won't spoil it, but I am just gonna say that it is one of the darkest (perhaps THE darkest) endings I have ever seen...<br/><br/>The Mist is an amazing horror movie. Truly a worthy watch.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars!"
"tburke85","7","1","3","22 June 2009"," The Mist An Effective Horror Thriller With Some Flaws
","The Mist is an effective horror thriller with some flaws from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this movie but unanswered questions, the dialogue at times, and the ending is what weighed the movie down. However The Mist is still not that bad it just could have been better. Darabont the man behind films like The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption continues to show his skill with this one as a filmmaker despite it's flaws. Thomas Jane is good as the lead David Drayton a movie poster artist who finds himself trapped in a grocery store with his son and many others when a freak storm unleashes nightmarish creatures that have a taste for human flesh. Jane may not win any awards with his performance but he's still convincing as David. The same can go for Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs Carmody in a rare villain role. Harden's character definitely has more than a few screws loose and can be as scary as the monsters outside lurking in the mist because she's clearly losing her mind. Harden is impressive in the role and she eventually gets whats coming to her. The rest of the cast including Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Andre Braugher in a brief extended appearance are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie does have some suspense, anticipation, a little humor, and the various creatures that come in all shapes and sizes are terrifying. Most of them are never clearly visible because they're in the mist so you only get glimpses which was okay but a clearer view of what they looked like would've been a little better considering several of the blood thirsty monsters are only given mere cameo appearances. All of them are still do their part but they could've been given more screen time. There is some suspense build up and anticipation which doesn't quite pay off but it's not entirely a failure either. A lot of questions are left unanswered except for one brief explanation as to where the creatures came from and how they got here. It was because of some kind of military experiment to create a window into another dimension which unleashed this whole other world with nightmarish beasts onto ours or something like that. A better explanation as to what happened would've also helped the film a little because it's better than no resolution at all. Some loose ends storyline wise aren't tied up by the end, the pacing was slow at times, the dialogue wasn't the greatest occasionally either, and some of the characters made stupid decisions which seems to be a trend horror movies have these days. The sequences involving a creature being shown in the mist or eating someone in a gruesome way are well executed but there could've been more of them. The special effects were so-so because at times you can definitely tell it's CG. The ending wasn't the best and if they had changed it the movie at least to me would've been much better. Despite it's flaws The Mist is still for the most part a good horror thriller better then most that are out there. Overall The Mist has gruesome deaths, some suspense, anticipation, scary villains, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast who make this horror film worth watching at least once."

","I always enjoyed Steven Kings books as a child, but when you look back on them its sometimes hard to remember how you looked past the cheese. The Mist, however, was my favorite King story. The last time i read it must have been 10 years ago at least, yet during the film i was so familiar with everything. so its a great adaptation.<br/><br/>firstly my only gripe. the CGI is poor. in todays standards, which are very high, you have to have the best graphics to even make people half wonder if its real or not. so when dealing with creatures that aren't real you need to back it up with realistic graphics.<br/><br/>this isn't a traditional horror. for me, what was so compelling about the story wasn't the action with the creatures, but the microcosm of the world within the supermarket. there are a fantastic array of characters, thoughts and beliefs, which don't always stay the same.<br/><br/>this is actually a really gripping film, and a lot better than i thought it would be. i was impressed by the directing, Darabont is a top filmmaker and should really get more films made.<br/><br/>i would really recommend this film, it is not about fighting off alien creatures, it is about how certain people deal and react to situations. It is also how people adapt and change during difficult times and how these difficult times can bring out the worst in people, human nature and all its excuses at its most deadly and backwards."

","Giant insects and sundry other creatures, some of them entirely new species, pop up in an unnatural fog that settles over a small Maine town, and all hell breaks loose. A group of people are trapped in a grocery store when the fog overtakes the town, and some but not all of them do their best to survive. It doesn't work out too well for anybody. Lots of gory effects, some of it startling and vivid and some of it simply laughable. Pretty decent CGI on the majority of the creatures. The plot is a cousin to THE FOG, minus the pirates and hidden gold. A reasonable time killer with a downer of an ending, so beware. A stone-faced Tom Jane stars, and is surrounded by some familiar faces, including Jeff DeMunn and Marcia Gay Harden, who as a Bibe-spouting hag decides the fog represents the end of the world, and requires human sacrifice. As if the terrified folks in the store don't have enough to worry about."
"Mr_Censored","7","1","3","3 April 2009"," The Frank Darabont Redemption?
","Not quite.<br/><br/>Following a rather violent storm, an assortment of small-town Maine residents find themselves trapped in a grocery store as a mysterious mist envelopes not only their town, but possibly the rest of the world. It's established early on that if you go into the mist, you don't come back. Well, that's not entirely true, as your legs might make a return. It doesn't even take 48 hours before the local zealot converts two-thirds of the store's population into a blood-thirsty cult, which isn't really much of a feat when the competition -- the outside world -- is populated by gigantic bugs, tentacles, birds and other assorted creatures that the back of the DVD case labels as ""otherworldly.""<br/><br/>Writer/Director Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Green Mile"") makes his return to horror in ""The Mist,"" adapted from a story written by none-other than Stephen King. Following the undeserving flop of 2001's ""The Majestic,"" it's not surprising that ""The Mist"" has some key issues. Darabont seems almost unsure of himself making this movie, as the mood is never properly settled. The first half of the flick feels like a glorious and gruesome modern day B-movie. With its nasty special effects (not to mention, some hokey looking tentacles) and ugly creatures, it's a movie that is certain to haunt the dreams of any children that may catch a glimpse by mistake. The second half, though, attempts to make some sort of commentary on human nature, and gets lost in the monster madness. Truth be told, ""The Mist"" is much more effective when it plays it straight, almost like a ""Night Of The Living Dead"" with bugs.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane plays the protagonist to Marcia Gay Harden's truly scary antagonist, as the townsfolk ultimately succumb to some blood-thirsty creepy-crawlies and some old-school, hardcore bible-thumping. While the second half of the flick is chilling in its own right, it never reaches its point. You think what you're watching it going to make a statement and then ""Bang!"" -- at the speed of a bullet -- its dropped. The ending is truly cruel and will leave you unsettled for some time after watching it, which, I suppose, means that ""The Mist"" did its job correctly. It's certainly not Darabont's best work, but hopefully he'll get his sea-legs again and come back with another true classic. Taken for what it is, though, it's a movie that is guaranteed to make you squirm in your seat a bit and make your blood run cold at other moments, as you shout at the screen to some of it's blatantly ignorant characters. Clichés may run rampant, but much enjoyment can be derived from the new aged creature-feature."
"angelocrus","6","1","3","2 April 2009"," Somewhat Maybe
","This is the first time I have felt this way about a movie. This feeling lingered in me since last night, after I watched the movie The Mist. If I am a movie critic I say, 'Red Alert: Stay Away From This Movie.' The story broke my heart. Its fiction I get it, but its media its aim is to spread the words of whoever are words were.<br/><br/>I understand it represents reality that humans are weak, brought by desperation humans will seek for answers even if contrast to their beliefs. I also understand the reality that there are no real heroes (except for good moms of course, it is also in the movie).<br/><br/>What I am asking is that- what is the sense? After making this movie, what do YOU expect us to get? I was entertained until he killed them I went out from this reality and thought myself as him until he killed them I like hero movies, I like it when their characters were played by plots too good to be true but I don't think it's a good idea if the plot goes too far killing someone to save him from pain yet to come.<br/><br/>I have not read the book yet, but if the book were everything the movie is I guess it's really painful how the characters' characters are being written. I thought about the book by Cormac Mc Carthy- The Road when the movie ended. Some people might say Mist-type of heroes are stronger but I believe The Road-type of heroes truly are.<br/><br/>I rate this movie six for good acting, Mrs. Carmody really made herself hatable, good special effects, good-looking characters. The ending spoiled everything."
"alain-minsart","7","1","3","17 March 2009"," Starts of brilliant but ending ....
","This movie starts out really good, the acting is great and very believable. Frank Darabont really captures the mood and settings and can recreate the environment of the book really well. Not to many scary sequences do occur and that is good for a typical King adapted movie. The mood is set more around the setting of the interaction between people locked up in a contained space in face of a unknown danger outside. The religious aspect is great and fantastic to see how people can change opinions when put to the ultimate test. So far the movie is living up to all my expectations, but then in the end-sequence something happens, that I cannot really appreciate. I read the book and Frank stayed loyal to its original ending, but he didn't manage to create the same feeling or understanding that the reader has for the deed of the main character. I wouldn't want to see it end otherwise, although it is debatable that people would actually act the same way under the same conditions. But I have the feeling that Darabont didn't know good on how to bring over the emotions on the screen and went to hasty in delivering us an ending. It could have been better build up if he had just taken a little more time in setting the right mood and showing more of the desperation that the characters feel in those final moments. Although it was an unsatisfying ending, overall it is a film that I would greatly recommend to anyone who is fan of Stephen King and the horror genre, where the focus is more on suspense then on gore blood gusting sequences. A well deserved 7 from me."
"doc9-2","7","1","3","11 March 2009"," A surprisingly intelligent horror movie
","A group of people is caught in a supermarket, because a mysterious mist is covering the whole town. In this mist, alien monsters appear to attack and slaughter one person at a time... this sounds like a trashy TV b-movie on a rainy Sunday afternoon? It is. But only on the surface, for sure! Many audiences only see the outline plot, get their prejudices and attitudes towards it and are not able to see the deeper core of the story. It is really about human behavior in extreme situations. The monsters become the supporting part. The (very realistic) stupidity of scared people who drive themselves and others into irrational rages is both well observed and shocking. There are some important details to be watched which really give the film more than one way for interpretation. The all together cruel and depressing end IS one of the best to be seen in years. Beside the well written story, whose quality may be recognized at a second glance, THE MIST is just a really good horror movie. The CGI is great, the aliens are disgusting and terrifying. The uncompromising killings of likable characters is brutal and worth mentioning it.<br/><br/>All together, THE MIST is not as brilliant as THE GREEN MILE and, of course, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. But it is another, this time definitely UNDERrated, film version of a Stephen King novel. Frank Darabont proves again that he really knows how to keep the tension and shock the audience in an intelligent and demanding way.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>(I hope the English from a German was understandable) :)"
"I_John_Barrymore_I","Null","1","3","5 March 2009"," The Mist
","A horror film in the truest sense of the word, The Mist's chills and thrills strike from as many different angles as the creatures that terrorise the protagonists.<br/><br/>While it's the moments of human horror that are the most effective, what's going on outside the supermarket is terrifying indeed, with all the fantastical elements handled in a pleasingly real-world, logical way. Just as pleasing is the fact that - almost unheard of in the horror genre - no one makes any stupid decisions - when people venture out to certain death it's for a damn good reason.<br/><br/>My one major criticism is that Marcia Gay Harden's religious nutcase is given considerably more screen time than she warrants and the purpose she serves the story is poorly developed (despite her screen time) and not entirely plausible.<br/><br/>The brilliant, inspired ending must rank among the finest of recent years."

","I first read Stephen King's 'The Mist' many years ago and found it absolutely riveting. It was one of those stories that - despite being preposterous - completely drew me in. For days, even weeks, afterwards I would chew-over the characters and their plight, and think what I might have done in the same place. That's a sure sign of a writer who knows his craft. Wyndam's little-known 'The Kraken Wakes' had a similar effect.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont has worked with King before, bringing his 'Green Mile' and 'Shawshank Redemption' shorts to the screen. I have read neither of these stories, and though I found the former rather maudlin as a movie, 'Shawshank' was certainly a triumph. Neither did well at the box-office, but they were DVD smash-hits. Such is the power of spoken word.<br/><br/>Darabont's 'The Mist' sticks very closely to King's story. There is very little preamble. In fact, it's just a little too sketchy for my tastes and would have benefited from a few more seconds' emphasis. We are 'in it' very quickly indeed. The body of the story is a very clever weave of the enemy within and without. Where, ultimately, are the real monsters? In the mist or in our minds? There are very definitely monsters in the mist. They're bizarre, original, and quite terrifying. Although no more substantial than CGI, each species is well-realised, you seldom see the joins, and the actors interface with them extremely convincingly. They're better than the demons of 'Pitch Black'; and those are pretty good. Inevitably, these monsters do unpleasant things to people. I won't dilate upon that.<br/><br/>But the other monsters are human. And they always create the worst horror in truth. After all; how many 'Saws' would it take to equal Auschwitz? A disparate group of people are holed-up in a supermarket. And as the mist monsters prowl outside, the subconscious monsters begin to hatch in the store. People start cracking-up. Soon there are two tribes: religious zealots endorsing old-tyme religion, and a shrinking body of 'rationalists' trying to make sense of the incomprehensible. Anyone who thinks that such a scenario couldn't happen, and happen just as quickly, clearly doesn't watch the news. Darabont wisely omits a back-room seduction that King included in his original story. It was cheap and quite inappropriate. Although this movie inevitably entails a mixed-sex cast; it is, in truth, a survival story, and that is where the focus is maintained. <br/><br/>As I say; the movie follows King's plot with unusual fidelity. A small group makes an escape, preferring at last to risk the terrors without than abide the company of those within. And here Darabont makes a second diversion. Whereas Stephen King leaves his characters in an uncertain limbo; Darbont gives us an unequivocal solution. And - being human - it is surely the most horrific end of all.   <br/><br/>I am very much reminded of 'The Thing' by this movie, and not because the lead character has a publicity poster of Carpenter's masterpiece on his study wall (which I suspect to be a sneaky homage by Darabont). Both movies are about terror, paranoia, and claustrophobia, and how they work upon our subconscious even more than the monsters themselves. Ultimately we fight our fear, rather than its cause. <br/><br/>This movie goes way beyond all of the slasher-crap I have seen and - mostly - snoozed through these last few years. Yes; there's blood and guts a-plenty for those who want them. And those who want monsters won't be short-changed either. But for the thinking viewer, there's also a great deal more. <br/><br/>It isn't perfect, by any means. The characterisation is a little too sketchy. I wasn't induced to care for them as much as I should have. The actors are B/C-list but still capable for all that. It's not their fault that they sometimes don't convince. The script isn't particularly clever either, even allowing for the fact that the characters are mostly red-necks. And the editing lends a slightly fragmented appearance here and there. But it still has a great deal to commend it. The mist ambiance is wonderfully realised. And the brittleness of relationships and low limits to mortal courage and endeavour bring a jarring reality-check to the modern genre of mutli-skilled super-heroes. There isn't a particle of humour in this movie, cavalier, ironic or otherwise. Which is, in fact, a mistake, because we evolved humour to deal with stress, and some characters would certainly have employed it under the circumstances.<br/><br/>This work is not as good as 'Aliens' or Carpenter's 'The Thing' but it's certainly up there in the same league. I believe it is the best horror movie I have seen since they two set the gold-standard some 30 years ago."

I might have tried - I wouldn't have noticed. It certainly tried to be a bit gory but failed by far. Probably it even had some message as all ""good"" American major releases have on but i just couldn't figure out if i was to be a believer or not.<br/><br/>The cgi was nice but surely not stunning, the blood and wounds and stuff was so horribly overdone it looked like it wanted to be saw and just couldn't get a grip on it - I laughed most of the time.

Those inside the store have to fight against the creatures outside but also against themselves as they all take sides/are injured/kill themselves and decide what is more important- themselves or caring for others.<br/><br/>I didn't have high hopes for this film. It seemed like it was going to be a creature feature version of ""deep blue sea""- the scary stuff actually is more funny.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised though.

This one, I was really surprised as how it did better than I thought it would.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont had some challenges in bringing ""The Mist"" to a captive audience, but I was captive. Granted there were a few bumps here and there, but I left the theater talking about it, disturbed by it. And wondering what I would do in the same situation. Who would I side with? And that I feel is the point. It was more than about ""the monster(s)"" it was about people and Frank Darabont took the high road to concentrate on them and their conflicts more than ""the monster(s)"". That's what made it interesting to me. What the people had to do, what they were armed with, their thoughts, their beliefs, their selfishness or non-selfishness, panic or calm, and what to do in a crisis. Who becomes ALPHA, and who gets just nutty.<br/><br/>I can identify with those who do not plan, cannot plan on the go, cannot devise plausible strategies and think that by saying ""we are a team"" means you ARE a team. There is an ""I"" team -- and that is the talent you bring to the table that others need to form that team. Without it, you make fatal decisions. Fatal decisions were done here, as well as wise ones. Again, what you chose delivers your destiny. ""The Mist"" was very effective in telling this side of the tale. <br/><br/>Which is why those who are seeking more of a ""story"" may like this. Those who want the horror of ""monsters"", well, ""The Mist"" lets you decide what monsters you want to focus on.

I think Marcia Gay Harden had to act very well for people to have that kind of gut reaction to a fictional character.

Surprisingly, 'The Mist' manage to balance the horror rather well, attempting to bring a human connection to the supernatural events.

Marcia Gay Harden's character overshadows the film for far too long, her apocalyptic - end-of-the- world - preaching rather tire on proceedings.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane should be commended for his solid performance, playing a stereotypical lead role but bringing real life and belief to his character.

Whilst there are plenty of good horror moments, and a number of fine set-pieces, nothing is scarier in this film than what the people do to each other over the course of the film.<br/><br/>At the heart of this film is an excellent cast. Thomas Jane's David Drayton makes a good everyman hero and is ably supported by Laurie Holden and Nathan Gamble (impressive as Drayton's son), whilst the increasingly fantastic Toby Jones is magnificent as Ollie Weeks. However, the standout performance (and role) is Marcia Gay Harden's as Mrs. Carmody, a Christian fundamentalist, sure that the apocalypse has come, who whips up part of the group into a fervour. She is, without a doubt, the most terrifying thing in the film.<br/><br/>The actors are helped by a superb adaptation by Darabont. The characters, which form a decent microcosm of the society, are wonderfully defined and are develop interestingly. Their divisions and disputes are simmering quietly under the surface at the start of the film and the way they develop is fairly believable. Added to this, the dialogue is very good and there are occasional moments of dark humour (one moment, when Carmody is whipping up her followers with a chant of ""expiation"", leads to the wonderful line ""Welcome to Sesame Street kids. Today's word is expiation."").<br/><br/>It isn't perfect. The visual effects often jar and it can't quite keep the intensity going all the way through, but this remains a thoroughly impressive, highly recommendable, completely satisfying piece of work. Added to that, it has a bleak, excellent ending which demonstrates this film's integrity. Darabont was offered more money for the film if he changed the scripted ending (different from the original story) and he declined. This is horror with the courage to follow its ideas and story through to a proper conclusion which deserves to be seen and appreciated by a wide audience.<br/><br/>4 Stars out of 5"

","It was mostly my appreciation of Tom Jane that led me to this otherwise little-promoted Stephen King book-cum-movie, despite the fact that I'm not much of a horror buff. In respect to him I was certainly satisfied with the movie. But there's more to it than that ...<br/><br/>A formulaic horror movie sequence sets the premise for the film - a bunch of people trapped in a building and subject to the whim of a mysterious monster (or something). From the remainder of the film a number of points can be raised. Filmcraft-wise, the CG is not particularly amazing. The monster(s) work much better when hidden behind the mist. A number of times early on their texture doesn't really match the rest of the scene. The mist itself was used an a great way though, with enough people disappearing into it, and appearing from it to properly convey the ""in here and out there"" feel that the captives would be feeling. The direction was quite good with plenty of slow zooming and panning that I thought worked well.<br/><br/>Religion was also brought into the mix to provide a complicating element within the shop to supplement the ones outside. Apart from losing some of my faith in people, it served well to identify the required human reaction to horrific circumstances. I thought this was done a little bit too conveniently, but it didn't step over the edge, even though it went close.<br/><br/>The acting was reasonable without being exceptional, probably my fondness for Tom Jane leads me to think he was quite good.<br/><br/>The final point I'll raise deals with the end. There are comments that call is a homage to a B grade film. I thought quite different when I saw it. I felt it was a very non-Hollywood ending, that wouldn't sit well with many in the audience, and I appreciated the intent.<br/><br/>In summary, I wasn't expecting much and what was presented was mostly well executed (no pun intended - never mind) and the ending was enough to make it more memorable than it otherwise would have been. Definitely see it if you like horror, and no harm in watching it if you like Tom Jane either."

","Based on a short story by Stephen King comes The Mist A mist envelops a small Maine town and dozens are trapped inside a supermarket knowing that in the mist are horrible creatures and being stranded soon takes its psychological toll If you like the sound of this you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption director Frank Darabont and acclaimed writer/producer (The Green Mile) seems unsure at times whether to use the documentary styled film shooting or stick to a traditional style of movement, but that aside he is a master of creating apprehension and unease. Also Frank Darabont treats Kings work with the respect it deserves with high production values. Thankfully it's not another dire TV movie.<br/><br/>The effects are good but suffer at times due to the over use of CGI, luckily the solid actors including Thomas Jane (Stander), Laurie Holden (Silent Hill) are there to compensate for this as the film is mainly character driven. Although melodramatic at times The Mist highlights the silliness of fanatical, cult religions as the trapped shoppers split into two camps: those who believe it is an act of a vengeful god and those don't.<br/><br/>I love brave bleak endings. The Descent, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Elephant Man, The Thing, They Live, to name a few but Mists ending whilst not as preachy as the recent film The Happening is let down by a needless, emotionless ending, that extinguishes all that came before.<br/><br/>The tag lines read 'Fear Changes Everything' and 'Stephen King's Legendary Tale of Terror', but The Mist while not a bad film falls short of becoming a 'Shining' classic."

","OK, now I know many regard some of Stephen King's earlier work as his best, first and foremost. I regard the likes of Creephshow, IT, The Stand and even Rose Red as his most critical films and mini-series in my view. Mainly because of the ground work he put in place for them and the sheer scope of the films in regards to making characters strong and understandable. However he never forgets to put his famous horror into them and I think he has succeeded with The Mist.<br/><br/>We have strong characters, the mystery surrounding the monsters and what is actually happening to the characters. We get a sense of the Stand here, with regards to their being a virus but in this it is a mist that covers the planet. Out of this mist comes creatures you would have only read about or heard of in books or just simply King's imagination. The ending to this film has been criticised but in my view it ends the film with a clear motive; true horror that scares you to the very depths of your morality.<br/><br/>All in all a great film I can only stress as being one of King's best works."
"EJasonNYM","10","1","3","27 October 2008"," A chilling tale
","I have to start by saying that The Mist is so much more than your prototypical horror movie. Throughout the movie there is just a chilling aspect to it that you can't put your finger on. With most horror movies or movies of this type you watch it knowing that there will be some kind of breakthrough and that the good guys will make it, however in this movie you sit spellbound to it, knowing that they are fighting an extremely uphill battle that is likely not to succeed. There is not any one character that dominates this movie to me, but instead its a good ensemble cast that each adds to to the mix. The Mist itself just lends to the mystery of what is coming after them. The way I looked at it was that the mist represented our fears..the fears that we just can't see but we know its there..lurking in the shadows. In closing this is a pretty good movie that may leave some feeling just a little bit colder."
"TomCruiseFan99","10","1","3","20 October 2008"," What a horror movie is supposed to be, with a shocking ending for good measure.
","Based on the short story by Stephen King, and directed by the Frank Darabont, who is proving quite successful at bringing King's stories to the big screen (The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile), this horror movie is a refreshing addition to a genre which lately has been bombarded with ""torture porn""-styled gore flicks. Besides being a scary thrill-ride, there's a serious undertone running through the film, about how we as normal people can become dangerous when faced with dire situations.<br/><br/>A close-knit community of friends and neighbours barricade themselves in a grocery store once a mysterious mist descends on their small town. Their first fear is a terrorist chemical weapon, but soon they realize that concealed in the mist is a vast array of creatures. Some small, others gigantic. Creatures who all have one thing in common: wanting to feast on the humans inside. It soon becomes a battle of wills against not only keeping the creatures out, but also trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy against the rising panic and fear inside the supermarket, especially once a Bible-thumping woman starts spouting that she ""hears messages from God"" and this is His wrath. Once she starts getting survivors to listen and follow her, it's only a matter of time before the people inside have to choose a side.<br/><br/>What sets this horror film apart as one of the best in years is the constant uneasy sense of dread, a quality that has made Stephen King a master storyteller, and which goes a long way to show that you don't always need blood and guts to keep an audience on edge. In fact, the masterful direction ensures that the jump-out-of-your-seat moments are guaranteed, and the brilliant creature effects are bound to keep you squirming.<br/><br/>The performances are all excellent, and unusually for this genre there is a lot of character development, and the best performance comes from Marcia Gay Harden, who plays the maniacal Mrs. Carmody - determined to make everyone see the error of their ways and ""convert"" to God's teaching. She soon becomes a dangerous woman, which has far-reaching consequences for everyone.<br/><br/>The shocking ending will be a talking point for many, and even though it is altered from King's original novella, I believe this ending works better. It will also keep you thinking about it for days."
"andrianos76","10","1","3","19 October 2008"," A great film for the thinking viewers
","This movie was a total surprise for me. To be honest I was prepared to watch an average pop corn like thriller. But instead ""the Mist"" is a film that goes far bellow the surface of the basic script. So we have a bunch of people trapped within a supermarket that is surrounded by a mysterious and deathly mist. They hear screams of death coming from the mist whereas they become witnesses of illogical incidents that alternate their understanding of the reality. So from the beginning of the movie the viewer comes up with this situation. The success of the director is that he avoids the unnecessary use of scenes of splatter and of typical horror but he focus in escalating the suspense and the essence of mysterious. Soon you feel like you (the viewer)are trapped in the store and you try to figure out what is going on. Shortly the greatest enemy may become the scared guy that is trapped with you in the store rather than the bizarre threat that comes from the mist. Also a great question arises about who is able and must lead the people in the store (see it also in a larger scale where the trapped people in the store is the today's society).<br/><br/>I was fascinated from the script, amazed from the acting and impressed from the direction of Frank Darabont. This movie is a must for the viewer that wants to think after the film about the human nature and its rationality of its behavior under extreme circumstances and also for that viewer that wants to see a great mysterious story. By the way the ending of the film may be voted in the future as on of the top endings in the film's history."

","--- SPOLER ALERT! ---<br/><br/>After Reading a few of the comments here i decided to watch this movie and i liked it a lot. Obviously a lot of people writing comments here totally missed the plot. <br/><br/>I normally don't write comments on movies because there already is a lot of comments that say the same things i have to say. But when saw so many negative comments about the story and especially the ending i just had to make one. <br/><br/>The movie has a good start, we don't get to really know what is happening. We know there has been a big storm and people are coming into the towns store to stock up supplies, and all of a sudden there is a guy running in, with blood in his face, totally scared screaming something about a mist that people disappeared into screaming. And then the mist surrounds the store and monsters come out of the mist killing people. Here is where the interesting part start, what is happening? What are this monsters and where did they come from? People are getting scared and desperate and turn on each other and there is this ""crazy"" extremely religious lady that start talking about that this is god's revenge on humanity for committing all of the sins. After a while she has managed to talk about half the group of people into believers.<br/><br/>We get to know a story about some scientists that opened some kind of portal to another world and that these monsters came through there. All this monsters kinda looks like the plagues god released described in the bible. So what are these monster's really? Is this god releasing the plagues again? Or is everything coincidences? The religious lady wants Drayton to sacrifice his son to stop all this, just like some guy (Not too good at biblical names and i don't remember his name) in the bible did to his son to end the plagues.<br/><br/>Now you should kinda see why the movie had to end the way it did. It leaves the audience thinking, was this just a coincidence or was it the fact that Drayton finally killed (Sacrificed) his son that made it all stop? This is what make me think that the whole movie was good, it leaves the question if it really is god or coincidence, and what could be the consequence of not believing in god and following his will. Now i'm not a believer, and i never read the bible or anything but i still like this kind of movies, especially when they leave you thinking like this after the movie. <br/><br/>To sum up the movie, The story is great 10/10, tho some of the characters in the movie was a bit too dumb. Also the monsters could have looked more ""real"" (you can clearly see they are made digitally)but the story makes up for all these flaws. <br/><br/>If you read this comment without seeing the movie (wich i hope you didn't cause then i pretty much spoiled it for you) i can really recommend you see it. <br/><br/>Easily worth a 9/10"

","Set in Maine and filmed in Shreveport, ""The Mist"" is nominally about strange monsters in the thick mist that engulfs a small community one day. But most of the movie takes place in the local supermarket where a strange cross-section of the town's population happen to be trapped, trying to elude the evil things inside the mist.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is the cool one, and dad, David Drayton. He is an artist, drawing movie posters, and with a college education, something some of the locals are jealous of.<br/><br/>At the other end of the spectrum is Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody, a religious freak who sees this crisis as God's punishment for bad human behavior.<br/><br/>As the crisis deepens and people die, the people in the store become divided into two camps, those who think like David and those who think like Carmody.<br/><br/>But the movie is only thinly about the monsters, and where they came from. It is more a study of human nature and how people react to a crisis and to each other. In many respects it is ""Lord of the Flies"" among adults.<br/><br/>Mostly interesting, but often too exaggerated to be taken as a serious story.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: As David heads towards town after an overnight storm, to get supplies and to fix his broken studio window, he notices many military vehicles ""coming off the mountain"" in a hurry. As it all turns out they had been doing some experimenting and had opened a ""portal"" to another dimension that let some strange creatures through. It was these that were hiding in the mist and endangering everyone. In the end David and 4 others were stranded in the mist when his vehicle ran out of fuel. Not wanting to subject them to the monsters, he shot everyone, even his son. But then as the mist started to lift finds that the military has achieved the upper hand, all died for no reason and David was on his way to insanity."

","I rented this knowing nothing about it and while I was pleasantly surprised by elements of it which could have made it great, it suffered from too many of the flaws common to American films.<br/><br/>First of all, it became evident all too quickly that the film was populated by fairly standard, shallow clichéd characters which is somewhat unfortunate given that it focuses mainly on their interaction, the only one of them to rise above the mundane was the insane Christian woman, but sadly the American obsession with ramming religion (positively or negatively) down our throats is a cliché in itself and her character became so mind numbingly irritating so quickly that she became a tedious annoyance who took far to long to die.<br/><br/>On the positive side, anyone who's played 'Half life' should enjoy the monster scenes and atmosphere, I understand the game was partly based on the novel, but the film is undoubtedly, in imagery and sound, influenced by the game, and the idea that the town has been engulfed by a bizarre alien world seeping through to our own works pretty well.<br/><br/>With all of this together I'd have given this a 5 at best but then we come to its contentious ending. Had they shoehorned in a happy one while my favourite 'Dead can dance' song was playing I'd have been seriously annoyed, but no, a director had the balls to give us a rare, quite horrific ending in an American film and it was absolutely wonderful. A memorable sequence which raised this from an average time waster to something I'd actually recommend."

","...and I haven't seen another film that affected me nearly as much until now! This film blew me away, I'm still shaken by the powerful emotional effect it had on me.<br/><br/>OK, so I was looking forward to a lazy Sunday afternoon with a new Stephen King adaptation, fully expecting something a bit fluffy like Secret Window, and for the first 20 minutes I got my wish... but man was I ultimately wrong! This is the first King film I've seen without having read the story first and I'm all the more impressed for it.<br/><br/>I think that to get the impact of this film you have to switch off from the slightly goofy CGI and immerse yourself in the all-encompassing humanity of the story. I've only seen Thomas Jane in Deep Blue Sea so wasn't expecting much from him in the acting department, but hats off to the guy... he sold the emotion 100 percent. I felt everything that he felt to an extent where I was questioning the hopelessness of the human condition... at times in this film he rooted a depression in me that shocked and disturbed me! Whilst Jane stood out a mile for me, I also have to shout out to the supporting cast who did an incredible job of selling the emotions in this film... if you don't gasp, scream, cry, cheer, clap and break down into a snivelling wreck at various points throughout then you weren't watching the same movie as me!

Instead, the story focuses on the limited interaction between the folks trapped together. For me, this was boring, because i was just waiting for them to leave the whole time. It's like getting stuck in the root menu of DVD or something. nothing ever happens. The cast just slowly learns what we all know from the beginning of the movie, about the origin of the mist, and how it's dangerous to go outside.

I was pleasantly surprised at how the film captured the spirit of King's writing.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is a wonderful insight into humanity's ""mob"" mentality. It is, like most ""apocolyptic"" films, an exploration of what happens to a society when all the boundaries placed on us by civilization come crashing down.<br/><br/>The acting, as a whole, was not bad. Thomas Jane plays the part of David Drayton, an artist and father who is the voice of reason when a large group of people barricade themselves into a grocery store to protect themselves from ""the mist"" and the terrors that dwell in it. Jane's performance is good, but not great. At key moments I was very moved by his honesty on screen.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden really steals the show as a crazed evangelical who preaches her message of fire and brimstone, creating hysteria among the survivors shut away in the store. Her character really sets a fire to the rest of the actors, and at many moments i was both horrified and compelled by her crazed influence on both the people around her and the story itself.

"mjscarface","7","1","3","15 August 2008"," Overall, a nice horror package but has it's fair share of problems
","The Mist is a rare film you'll probably get to see it 'clean' (with no spoilers or even much expectation at all). It's not a big film and is shot more like a TV movie than a Hollywood blockbuster. In a small American town, the residents become trapped in a supermarket by a thick mist - but soon realise that something is IN the mist. A siege ensues that becomes as much about the human soul as it does about the nasties outside.<br/><br/>On the whole, I liked 'The Mist' and I think it was a decently acted piece, with a strong human element that's sorely lacking in today's horror movies. Tom Jane is very likable as the typical 'everyman' to which people gravitate towards to at times of crisis. Marcia Gay Harden is delightfully OTT as a Christian fanatic who gradually convinces the townsfolk that it's God's will that they be destroyed. As the situation worsens, so does the behaviour of the people and this becomes one of the more successful parts of the film. The sanctuary of the store, becomes just as dangerous as the mist itself.<br/><br/>While it's a proper B-movie, which I love, the lack of a big budget makes some scenes less effective than they should be. The ropey CG is thankfully kept in the mist or the shadows for the most part, but when it's first revealed around the half hour mark, the impact is taken away by the fact that it's clearly not real. The creepiest moments are those where characters go into the mist and where the horror is unseen. The gore effects however, particularly during a gruesome foray into the drug store are impressive and help to counter the CG beasties' deficiencies.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the acting is pretty good and help to sell the situation. However, there are some incredibly dumb mistakes that lead to disaster (and for a horror film, the fact that they stick out is bad). For instance, if you're holed up in a glass-fronted store, don't leave the electric lamps on display right next to the windows! Or if somethings trying to get under a metal gate... try closing the gate!!! It's a shame that a film which concentrates on the human condition, quite successfully, ends up stretching common sense like that.<br/><br/>Now on to the now-famous ending... which I won't give away of course. What I will say is that it's both extremely downbeat AND unexpected. It's bleak, but in a way that you probably wouldn't see coming until it hits you. The idea is fantastic... but I'm not so sure about the execution. First, the music (largely absent until now) smothers the final scenes and changes the entire feel of the film from small intimate B-movie to overwrought epic. Then, the passage of time is so short in the final moments that the outcome loses its impact. Finally, Tom Jane (who has been very good in the film until this point) doesn't quite sell the drama in my opinion. I just don't think the ending manages to deliver the powerful sucker punch it intended - and only a tiny bit of editing would have changed that.<br/><br/>But the good things about The Mist make you forgive the flaws unlike some films where they overshadow them. Either way, it's worth a look but rent it first, because this is looking like a case of love it/hate it."
"doctorlao-1","4","1","3","3 August 2008"," Incoherent
","There are a great many faults with this flick, but for me, the story is totally incoherent with no plausible explanation of what is happening and why. For example, what does ""The Mist"" have to do with all of these creatures that appear in it? At first, I thought that the mist was a poisonous gas cloud dispersed from some military chemical weapons plant. That would've been consistent with the old guy's nosebleed, common sense and such.<br/><br/>Most of the story line seems to follow that idea until -- a big banging on the roll-up door. Then, suddenly ""monsters"" appear out of a mist that now seems innocuous and created mostly to reduce the need for detailed CGI. And why the earthquake? And where did the mist come from in the first place (disregarding the standard ""another dimension"" crapola) and why does it clear up after only a few days? And how is it that everything is set right for the human race in the last few scenes with no explanation as to how the catastrophe might have originated?<br/><br/>The multiple ""mercy killings"" at the end were very predictable, as was the sole survivor's reaction when the mist cleared.<br/><br/>I did like the character of ""Ollie"" (Toby Jones), though, and Marcia Gay Harden was very good as the deranged Mrs. Carmody. Entertaining but incoherent."
"Seven_Thunders","6","1","3","6 July 2008"," Top quality horror, lazily-written ending.
","Stephen King has a way of bringing out the worst in fictional people, and The Mist is the epitome of fallen nature. The moment the mist hits Bridgton, Maine, fear envelopes the town. Locked in a grocery store after a bloody attack by an unseen monster, the people of this small town begin to descend into confusion and eventually madness under the fear-mongering preaching of the insane Mrs. Carmody. Soon, many horrible creatures terrorize the townsfolk in some very gruesome scenes. This is not a slasher flick, nor is it a Hitchcock thriller. But it hits on a visceral level, doing its best to illustrate the effects of a flood of monsters on the fragile sanity of its victims.<br/><br/>The acting is so-so, sometimes not carrying the weight of the character's emotion. The story itself is on the clunky side, but that becomes surprisingly inconsequential as the minutes fly by. It's a fascinating idea: A government project goes awry and opens a doorway to another dimension, spilling its creatures into our own. The people form two factions. The Carmody cult (not called that in the film or the novella), and the sane. The resulting chaos is nothing short of jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>SPOILER TERRITORY! SPOILER TERRITORY! SPOILER TERRITORY! Now I must throw down my ten cents of opinion on the ending. It sucked. Why? Because not only did it dissolve the motivations of the characters, who were driving into the mist in hopes of surviving to see the end of it, but it was thrown in simply for shock value. I expected much more out of Frank Darabont and Stephen King. It goes into the top five worst endings I've ever seen.<br/><br/>David Drayton and the other four survivors sit in the SUV that has finally run out of gas. They all sit wondering what to do. Then Drayton comes up with a brilliant idea: SHOOT THEM ALL. Including his six year old son. Wow, what a great idea. They run into one monster on their road trip to freedom, go on their merry and all of the sudden it's okay to murder.<br/><br/>One minute after the horrible deed, the military comes barging through the mist as it clears, carrying truckloads of survivors and soldiers armed to the teeth. They have everything in hand, and Drayton is left with his screams of insanity. Is that the ending King wrote in the original? No. And yet, somehow, he approved of this one. I thought that it was the Weinstein's idea, who are notorious for cutting movies down to smash cuts and mindless action. But alas, it wasn't so. I am a Stephen King fan, but not of this idea. This was lazy writing.<br/><br/>END SPOILER.<br/><br/>In short, despite the awful shock-value ending, the movie was alright. Not great. Doesn't live up to previous Frank Darabont adaptations from King's work, but it is something you won't forget."

","It has been a long time since I have waited for the theatrical release of what was (and still is) my favorite Stephen King novella. When I heard that Frank Darabont was directing, it escalated the excitement. Even looking at the actor/actress castings, it seemed this movie was bulletproof right out of the gate. Then I saw it on opening day.....<br/><br/>The End.<br/><br/>The film itself started off solid. It was easy to see where Darabont took liberties with the original story and made them work-an area much like he beautifully mastered with both Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile. The character development was terrific. Darabont's initial liberties were fairly clever: The poisonous stinging bugs, much more character development with the soldier from the dark and mysterious Arrowhead Project. In addition there were even tips of the hat to Stephen King's other grand work, The Stand, in which the infamous line, ""My life for you"" was prominently used. It was well-balanced definitely not out of place.<br/><br/>The movie went along fine, some areas even appearing more frightening than the read, such as teeth on the tentacles. The Pharmacy expedition also done well with the notable Aliens rip off excluded. Frank Darabont creates an atmosphere of fear and a dreary sense also contained in the book that the whole world may be gone. I'm getting ready to rank this as one of King's best screen adaptations.<br/><br/>So how does something this good go so bad? Easy to answer: The last three minutes.<br/><br/>Now there has been a whole lot of hoopla about David's choice to kill his own child in addition to three comrades at the end when they are out of gas and see no hope. Those who are not happy with this ending have often been stamped as being shocked by this transpiration, couldn't handle the grim reality of David's decision and that must be why. Not in this writer's opinion-there's a reason why this ending will go down as the one of the most ridiculous in the annals of Hollywood film making and that psychological pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey diagnostic explanation certainly isn't it.<br/><br/>The novella mastered the art of ""hope"". It also made the reader realize dread. Nothing seemed to survive The Mist. Darabont's vision alluded to that as well in the beginning; A man running into the store just screaming about how something in the mist took his friend, John Lee. Another man runs out to his car and within 5 seconds of being enveloped lets out a terrifying death scream-so fast the people inside believe it to be a pollution cloud. Norm, the bag boy, opens a door and then within seconds is being torn to shreds by a tentacle. Yet what does Darabont give us in between these assaults? A woman who decides she's gonna walk home and makes it there for a happy reunion with her kids. Not only that, but she finds a way to thumb a ride along on a military truck and gives a slow motion stare at David?! OH COME ON!!! That was about when this movie became an unintentional comedic stink fest-all it needed was the Stripes theme and Bill Murray with a cheesy grin right next to her. Oh, and then there's the clear sky behind the Army guys-looks like this whole mist mess was mostly a town phenomenon to the viewer, definitely can and will be solved-who were all of us to think this was possibly a global problem growing with future questions of survival.<br/><br/>The end of the book gave the reader a sense of hope in the face of dread. Darabont's bastardized version gives a ridiculous ""see? That's-why-you-never-give-up-hope"" horse apple to the viewer and as a result, completely killed the spirit (not to mention consistency) of the story.<br/><br/>I certainly ""hope"" this will be the last time an otherwise great movie will suck out loud so badly in the end to the point of ruination. So there ya go Mr. Darabont, you gave me hope and never wanting to give up. <br/><br/>Congratulations!"

"barbra-terris","10","1","3","16 June 2008"," best movie in a long time
","I have been a Stephen King fan for as long as I can remember, but this movie is by far his best yet. His imagination is amazing!!! Not only was this movie terribly frightening, but it showed so many levels of the human mind, feelings, and fears. Would the world ever really be taken over by huge bugs, spiders, and creatures with tentacles??? No, probably not. However, the range of emotions that is shown by the characters is definitely real. When faced with unimaginable situations, people tend to go through a range of emotions in order to deal with them. The relationship between Thomas Janes character and his son is truly amazing, and will hit you if you are a parent. How far he will go to protect his son, no matter the cost, is truly heart wrenching. Marcia Gay Harden's character's view on God and the reason why things happen, while a great message at first, breaks down all human logic as the movie progresses. This totally becomes a story about how people interact with each other when crisis hits. Yes, the scare factor is definitely there, you are terrified at every turn. But this movie is NOT just a scare fest... it will keep you thinking and feeling for these characters for the entire movie. How far they go to protect the ones they love, help their friends and neighbors, and try to outlast the creatures in the mist is what makes this movie the most terrifying, because sometimes its never enough. The ending of this movie will devastate most, and maybe make you cry, but as you think about it it is really the only way it could end. If you want a happy ever after, this is NOT the movie for you. If you want to be scared, while also connecting with some of the most intense characters I've seen in a movie in a long time then this is the movie for you!!! LOVED IT!!!!"

","** SPOILER ALERT ** Seriously, take war of the worlds and cross it with dogville and you get this movie. Except it's not as good as either. The acting is uneven at best, and the special effects are crude. The only time that the special effects look good is when the mist obscures the sight of badly-done computer graphics.<br/><br/>OK, am I being too harsh? Some people out there will no-doubt become fans of this movie. Why? Because of the ""deep"" ending. I heard from everyone, ""oh, the ending really shocked me""...so I sat through two hours of drivel in hopes that the ending would pull it together.<br/><br/>Only one problem: the ending was completely unbelievable. After all the pain in the ass that everyone went through, it is highly unlikely that they would have given up so easily. There wasn't even any impending threat to their lives...just some distant sounds of shrieking monsters. One of the key tests to determine whether an act is realistic is to know that you might have done the same thing in the same situation. None of us would, so the ending is total BS.<br/><br/>I think the director knew that he had a crap movie on his hands, and used the last scene to try to make the movie memorable...which it succeeds in doing. However, I'll always remember it as the dumb ""horror"" movie with the completely implausible ending."
"HorrorWriter7493","10","1","3","26 May 2008"," The Mist
","This film is truly creepy and it keeps you interested all the way through. Yes, it has some flaws, but all in all, it's a great film. I don't get why Christians said this was anti-Christian just because some crazy nutcase was preaching. I'm a Christian and I was not offended. In fact, this film has a bunch of Christian messages itself. The first one is to not take yourself so seriously and actually understand the Bible (crazy lady in the super-market). The second one is that man can not play God and can't possibly play God because he doesn't know what's going to happen next. I actually think the director and Stephen King threw that woman in there to throw the brainless Christians off and to attract the ones with that are intelligent. See this flick, but don't see it if you are easily offended."
"piattbruner","10","1","3","26 May 2008"," Best movie to come from a Stephen King novel........EVER!
","I've been a Stephen King fan since I could practically read. While other kids were watching Spongebob and power rangers, i was watching Christine and Carrie(pardon me using the two girl names as my examples). Through out the years I have rented every single movie to be inspired by a Stephen King story in a desperate attempt to find one that actually did the book SOME justice. For the past couple years Carrie and The Shining (not the one with jack Nicholson,(pardon me if i spelled his last name wrong) but the mini-series on SciFi) have been the only ones to fill my heart with pride, until this weekend when I rented this movie after my friend recommended it. As with most movies, i was a bit nervous that the Mist would turn out to just be a poor attempt at one of the great works of Mr. King, but i was gladly mistaken. This movie had me at the edge of my seat the whole way through. The story was a truly unique one that hasn't come along in a LONG while. The acting was all very believable from everyone, and i must say that Marcia Gay Harden's character scared the crap out of me (not to quote the movie, but she reminded me A lot of Jim Jones). The Mist s truly terrifying, psychologically AND otherwise. It is one of the must see horror movies of the year, if not the must see horror movie yet. Stephen King fans and movie buffs alike will not be let down."

Exactly.! Well this film really puts you in that position. Everyone is brilliant in the film especially Marcia Gay Harden as the vile bible basher, bizarrely in the film I actually started to believe what she was saying as there was no other logical explanation as to what was actually going on. The only thing wrong with this film was some poor CGI, but I can live with that. The ENDING, is amazing...and that all I'm going to say about it. If you are a fan of Horror, not especially gore but a sustained and tense horror, then you MUST see this film."
"Boloxxxi","6","1","3","18 May 2008"," Misty for a better ending.
","The Mist is about a bunch of people trapped inside a store because of a suspicion that something outside, in the form of a mysterious mist or fog, might be killing people. Well I like the weird and so I thought the idea was interesting. Didn't like the ending though. And I like kids BUT they can be very annoying and/or distracting in some movies. One of the most annoying child in a movie of recent times (I think) is the little girl in War of the Worlds with Tom Cruze with her constant chattering, nagging, bitching, and need for reassurance. Not only did Cruze have to contend with aliens, he also had his hands filled with this obnoxious brat AND her brother.<br/><br/>Ahhh, good to get that off my chest.<br/><br/>Now where was I? Most of the time kids do well in films but there's the occasional one where you wish they weren't there. In the mist the main character has a son whose absence, I thought, would have served this movie better. Why? Because he had to spend too much time reassuring him and being a ""daddy"" -I guess- when I wanted the story to move along and deal with what mattered: the mysterious mist and how the ""grown-ups"" were handling the situation. The kid was an unnecessary distraction that the movie could have done without. Another thing that annoyed me was that nutty religious woman. Made me wish I was there with a two by four (oh yeah, I'd put an early end to that nonsense).<br/><br/>The mist was yet another good idea that could have used better execution. Still, it was interesting enough with good effects to warrant 6 stars from me. Without the kid and that nutty woman I would have given it one more. And without that unsatisfactory ending I would have given it yet another. All said and done, quite probable that you'll enjoy this more than I unless you share my aversion for distracting daddy time and ranting religious nuts. Love, Boloxxxi."
"Eels25","6","1","3","18 May 2008"," What Can I Say But
","The entire flick left a bad taste in my mouth. And this bad taste seemed very unnecessary. Even before the shock ending which has garnered much publicity and praise for its daring the movie wasn't working for me. First of all the character Thomas Jane portrays isn't very likable. Despite the fact that he's presented as a loving father and husband I just didn't buy into anything he did and could care less about him or anyone he cared about. The supporting characters didn't offer up anything and were either obstacles or mindless companions offering up little nuggets of useless plot driven advice whenever prompted by the screenplay. Perhaps the biggest issue I had with the film was the character development. When the crap went down, and it does pretty quickly, I found that all of the characters could be killed by the creatures and I wouldn't care in the slightest. In a film like this, bland unlikeable characters are a huge no no. There are some scenes which are moments of pure cinema and despite the lacking on the character development/likability end the film was very well made and the effects were intense and well done. Overall though I just can't see myself giving this anything but a half-hearted recommendation. Maybe I expected too much out of it, what with all the good word of mouth about it and it being Frank Darabont spearheading the whole thing. Whatever the reason great effects and atmosphere can only carry a movie so far without the human component to hold it all together. I give this a six out of ten for the effects and atmosphere though perhaps I'm being too generous."

","I see this is a very appreciated movie. It appears that it's very scary, spectacular, original, even the best picture of the year.<br/><br/>Although I'm only 18, I think I've watched more movies then all the people who consider that ""The Mist"" deserves a 10/10 altogether.<br/><br/>There is really nothing that impressed me while watching ""The Mist"". I have no problem with the SF elements like the mist and it's private fauna; there is not one original thing in this movie, it is totally predictable (this culminates with the ending).<br/><br/>The acting is acceptable, the visual effects are average (they're OK, not spectacular), the sound tracks are quite lousy (and this could have been much more better); the movie is quite... ""static"", most of the action happens in just one building.<br/><br/>Even the few good thing about this movie are predictable, like ""There are no atheist in a crashing plane"" (you'll get the point if you watch the movie); personally I recommend a psychology book.<br/><br/>But what really gets to me is that cheap movies like ""The Mist"", which are supposed to be horror, are so appreciated (IMDb's current user rating 7.5/10) while other good, even great movies, horror or not (e.g. ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" - 5.0/10 IMDb's user rating), are considered just a waste of time, and I think usually by people that haven't even watched them.<br/><br/>I guess I've watched to many movies, and I watched this one in a rainy day.

This is based on a short story from way back in King's career, the resulting script is faithful to the way King writes his characters, the pacing was good, the inter-personal drama is well acted & written, Frank Darabont directs with real fervor, creating a modern horror monster movie, the ending would and probably did go over very well in Europe, it's the type of ending that usually gets changed for American audiences thankfully it was not. Many people here just can't take a movie for what it is entertainment, and in this movies case a parallel between monstrous behavior and real monsters.

And of course the ending is the best of it all, it makes the only logical sense and makes you leave the theater wondering, is that really what we do? do we loose faith that fast ? it makes you second guess all your actions, if i do things differently, will the outcome be for better or worst ? out of a religious point of view, the market people made the right choice but out of crooked faith, the ones who left, made the logical choice with no faith at all. good thing Mrs. carmody died, i always hate the doomsday preachers and those who allow, take away, banish or bless out of their own interpretation. and this makes you think of the larger picture, if she was shot first in the head, they would have been left with 5 bullets not four, and no lesson would have come out of this ? in the end, a great movie to watch, no waste of money on this one, guaranteed"

","Wow! Never has a movie captured the human spirit so well. The Mist is an allegory on the world we live in and the humans that inhabit it. The script is intelligent, thought provoking, frightening, relevant and without compromise.<br/><br/>Its all about the fear we inflict upon ourselves and others, and what fear makes us do when we cannot see through the mist in extreme situations. This is by far the best horror/sci-fi movie I have seen in a decade. Frank Darabont keeps you on the edge of your seat with characters that might seem stereotypical, and is exactly that, in order for them to represent all humans and all movements in society. After a slow build up with a few underwhelming CGI effects the movie really gets going and the effects get more and more convincing. There was one terrific and scary scene after the other that impressed me immensely since there was no underlying score to put you in a certain mood. They just work. Simply brilliant! Thank you Darabont for having the guts to give us this uncompromising thought provoking masterpiece in a time where studios only think of cost and benefit - flooding us with predictable by the numbers mainstream flicks."

It's bleak portrait of religions will definitely deter a lot of praise that it deserves (just look at ""No country for old men"" versus ""There will be blood"").

","Okay, I can only write 1 review so I chose to write one with minor spoiler instead of one with and one without. The very reason I'm writing this review is as a warning. As far as the spoiler goes, I'll try to lead up to it slow so that if you feel you get the gist of my warning before the end of the review you can stop reading and maybe save the surprise for movie-time. The movie was great, based on the best thing King ever wrote and one of my all time favourite stories. The characters were all cast perfectly and it stayed very true to the original story. (the fact that it was a SHORT story probably made that pretty easy.) But they changed something. And it really really bothered me. It bothered me in the way Law and Order SVU sometimes bothers me and it bothered me in the way the news sometimes bothers me. Maybe bother is too light of a word. I'm not going to say exactly WHAT they changed cuz the what doesn't really matter so no need to spoil that part. It was the HOW that bothered me. So here's the part that may give something away. If you are a parent, or if child-victims bother you even in fiction, you may want to rethink this and stick to the original work. It wasn't at all graphic, and to be honest it was done in the most tasteful way this change could have been done. Technically, they don't even really show it. But it is there and there's no way of saying ""well, maybe they meant this"" or ""maybe they meant that."" Nope. It's pretty unmistakable, and as a parent it's probably gonna keep me up the rest of the night especially considering the movie didn't end until 2am anyway. Its gonna take a a few hours of classic sitcoms on TVLand to soften my mood now. But don't let me be misunderstood. I'm not saying the director or screenwriter did anything wrong per-se, it was actually a very interesting twist. It wasn't a distasteful element like the entire movie Hostel was. It was a clever, interesting, and original twist that bothered the hell out of me. This movie would have been a 10, and I feel somewhat guilty giving it a 5 because of something that was completely a matter of taste and not quality. But my reasons are all right here so I think it's pretty much justified."

","I enjoyed the mist very much, manly because it brought a new element to the horror scene, believability, now not the situation but the way everyone reacted. I enjoy a movie were people act how they would really act. For example when people will cling to anything that has an answer, religion, and I enjoy watching fundamentalist get what's coming to them. The absence of one of those ""lone heroes"" with an easily seen evil was a fun new twist as well, because the main protagonist David Drayton having several flaws the slow him down. For example, is unrelenting love for his child, while heart, warming causes him to make decisions that could result in him getting killed, if you are looking at it from a self-preservation point of view."
"atliel","7","1","3","14 April 2008"," One of the better Stephen King horror adaptations
","There aren't enough horror films out there that utilize character development as part of their narrative or at least try to say something whether it's about society or the individual. Fortunately, The Mist makes an attempt, albeit not the best, in trying to examine fear and how it affects people in an enclosed setting. Needless to say it results in the inevitable mob mentality as witnessed in numerous tales (Lord of the Flies, J.J. Abram's ""Lost"", etc.) but in this case the antagonists are not from our world. This is a nice touch in that in no way can the audience relate to the creatures in any way. They show no emotion nor any motivation in their killing almost as if they were going about their business as usual. There is a similarity to ""The Old Ones"" of H.P. Lovecraft's ""Cthulhu"" where he describes their indifference to life around them and even note the monster at the end of the film with tentacles as if a nod to Lovecraft. That being said we are left to focus not on the creatures but on the struggle inside the supermarket between a growing religious fanaticism amongst the many against the few who hold onto using logic. This alone is enough to garner ten stars from me as this is the stuff that makes classics but unfortunately the third act falls apart rather quickly.<br/><br/>I won't give it away here but when you do see it I wonder if the general public will agree with me in wanting to know why everything had to lead up to this. Why does our lead protagonist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) deserve this? The problem isn't the down ending, which I typically enjoy in films, the problem is simply what does it all mean? What are we left with when the lights go up? That religion was the way to go? Or just wait a little longer and everything will resolve itself so don't fight it? I can't help but think that the ending's sole purpose was shocking for the sake of shock value and nothing else. Which leads to my next question: What is the deal with Stephen King endings anyway? I've read his books and somehow they end just right at least on paper but on the big screen they seem to fall apart (check out IT or The Stand as examples). There's something about the relationship between the reader (their imagination) and the written word and how it can dupe you into buying any convoluted plot that works to this very day. However, on the big screen, the filmmaker has to make his interpretation of said ending work for everyone. He can't convince it's right or wrong, it just has to work that one time and that's it. The majority of this film is entertaining, great atmosphere, good character actors and although this film's third act can be chalked up with all the other unsuccessful Stephen King endings the first two acts do make up for it."

Supposedly this makes the movie more ""real"", I think it makes it more amateurish and overall more difficult to watch and enjoy. The Mist uses all of these. Plus it is absolutely cheerless, there is no comic relief at all.<br/><br/>The movie surrounds an artist (Thomas Jane) trying to protect his little son from The Mist, and the creatures that dwell within. They are trapped by The Mist in a grocery store with his skeptical neighbor(Andre Braugher), a Prohibitionist/Abolitionist era New England religious busybody (Marcia Gay Harden), and a host of other hysterical bunglers.<br/><br/>The most skillful and intrepid of those trapped in the store seems to be the meek-looking assistant manager, Ollie (Toby Jones).<br/><br/>This movie has all of the predictable themes of a horror movie: a religious nut; the unbelieving, angry skeptic who refuses to believe that there is any real danger until it is too late; the cute kid; etc.<br/><br/>*** possible spoiler *** The ending follows the Twilight Zone-ish ""if only the hero waited another thirty seconds before his drastic, final action; things would have been all right"".

'There was no hope, better die in the car, than be eaten by those creepy monsters'.<br/><br/>Until this moment, I don't fully accept that, but it wasn't totally non-sense, like some people claim.<br/><br/>The CGI. The tentacle scene is great. No soundtrack gives a more realistic feel. But the tentacles are horribly made. The trailer is much better.<br/><br/>The acting. All brilliant, no exceptions. Thomas Jane is great. Marcia Harden was perfect, I was pleased that 'Dobby The-House-Elf' shot her in the head.<br/><br/>The film itself is pretty good. Stephen King does it again. A must see for all the genre's lovers."

"alleycat93","10","1","3","5 April 2008"," One Regret
","I have been a Stephen King fan since long before I was old enough to realize he was from my home state of Maine. I recall reading ""Firestarter"" in the fifth grade. <br/><br/>""The Mist"" has always been one of my absolute favorites, and I have read it, and re-read it many times. I always knew it would make a sensational movie. <br/><br/>My one regret is that I HAD read the story so many times, as there were very few surprises for me. That said, I was really pleased with the number of little pieces of the novella that were used in the movie. <br/><br/>I was not able to see the film on ""The Big Screen"", but made sure I had my DVD copy as soon as I could get my hands on it. The DVD cover told me that the ending was ""...one of the most SHOCKING movie endings ever!"", so I figured that would be a major diversion of the original ending in the book. <br/><br/>It was sadly predictable, as the final scene played out, but my biggest hang ups with Stephen King as an author have always been the endings to most of his books. I would certainly have been happy with this one, had it been in the book version!"
"sunsweet2","6","1","3","31 March 2008"," Perfectly ridiculous ending to a perfectly good movie
","As an avid Stephen King fan, I was excited over one of my favorite stories being made into a movie. It was a pretty accurate portrayal except for the ending. I could understand changing the ending of a story but at least make it believable. How Drayton looked at his son and shot him without a second thought is a little ridiculous. It just seems that in the movie world, there is no such thing as a happy ending anymore. I walked away from this so depressed and disgusted. <br/><br/>A much better ending would have been watching them attempt to survive, or resorting to suicide when all else seemed futile, like being attacked by one of the gigantic bugs. Maybe they could have cut out some of the relentless and aggravating Mrs. Carmody scenes in order to make a better finale."

","I bought this movie because I had heard this story about 17 years ago. It followed along what I knew, and even brought in new elements that didn't take away from the overall effects of the story. While it didn't creep me out, it did keep me on the edge of my seat, and brought out good and bad feelings towards all the main characters.<br/><br/>I was impressed all the way until the end. Up until that point all the remaining characters had a survival instinct driving them. Yet once they set out, they threw all that away and put forth no thought in how to keep going. The had plenty of time, and the intelligence, to come up with something. The final decision made was rash, came up with way too quick, and didn't do the rest of the film justice.<br/><br/>With that said, if you watch some of the people passing, you will see some irony.<br/><br/>Knowing how it ends, and how disappointed I am with it, it is hard to recommend this movie, but if you are a King fan, then you will want to watch it."

The movie was moving on target and the suspense was spellbinding. I had a feeling of nervousness throughout the movie and I was actually sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time. The actors and actress were perfectly cast for their roles. Then comes the ending; what a jerk this Frank Darabont is. He should never be allowed to adapt any Steven King novels and short stories period. He destroyed the story with that stupid unbelievable and most absurd ending. What was he thinking with this assisted suicidal ending, and to have a father kill his own son which should never be even thought of any point in time. I am completely appalled with this ending."

","This movie is the best fantastic horror SF movie i've seen since a long time. And by far, one of the best Stephen King movie adaptations. Far better than the Spielberg's adaptation of ""The war of the worlds"", from HG Wells, much more human. <br/><br/>All about this Frank Darabont movie is extremely well made, the oppressing ambiance, the giant insects and nightmarish creatures, the acting and the ending... The ending of this movie is one of the most disturbing and extreme I've seen from an Hollywoodian production. So, if you like SF fantastic and horror movies, this one is very particular. <br/><br/>No Disney ending here, à la ""Sound of music"" or ""Mary Poppins"". This movie ending is very disturbing.<br/><br/>Question yourself: if you have a loaded gun at home, what would you do with it in extreme situations? Who are the real monsters? The giant insects? The preacher woman? The guy with the gun who can kill people and invaders? Or yourself? Important stuff here...big metaphor about our role in society, about how we care about us and our neighborhood.<br/><br/>Key is: never despair, never lose hope, anything can happen, and never, NEVER misuse personal firearms, for any reason.<br/><br/>Great movie for all these questions. Well made, right on target, no pun intended."
"Joejoesan","7","1","3","29 March 2008"," Remember the movie Jude?
","Frank Darabont + Stephen King is usually a good combination. Think The Shawshank redemption en The Green Mile. And yes, The Mist is a very well made movie. Unlike most horror stories it focuses on the horror within ourselves, causing paranoia and panic. What happens to the people that are trapped in the store, is understandable and completely human. I liked that part. There's more suspense than gore. The tentacles of the monsters looked fake, though. Those effects would have worked better in black and white I suppose.<br/><br/>No, like everybody who's seen this movie it's the ending that puzzles me. Because no matter how dramatic it is, in the story there's no where a clue to be found that the main characters will do such a thing. Or maybe I missed it? Is there somewhere a conversation like: ""Please, don't let those monsters get me? I'd rather be dead...?"" And isn't it strange that the group of survivors will head to the unknown, trying to get out of the fog and suddenly give up like that? Up till ""the moment of truth"" The Mist is a well written scary ride in the name of entertainment. Nothing more. But the non-Hollywood ending suggests that there is more to this story. It pretentiously claims that ""this horror movie is more than just a horror movie."" But what makes The Mist so different? Was there an important statement to be made, that justifies the ending? Let's face it: it's a good film but really no Oscar material.<br/><br/>The Jude-like conclusion reminds me of the alternative finale in I am Legend. In the original version Will Smith dies. But in this version he survives and leaves New York in search of other survivors. That ending was much more positive than the original one and actually worked much better. Let's hope a similar ending will also be found on the The Mist DVD.<br/><br/>7/10"

When she got shot i was so happy. Even out loud i said ""finally"". Also, what was up with the ending? That was probably the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in my life. I couldn't believe it.

"benmcfee","9","1","3","29 March 2008"," Reminiscent of Night of the Living Dead... Especially in Black and White
","I don't think I've spoiled anything, but be cautious, depending on how sensitive you are!!<br/><br/>It's official: Frank Darabont should be the only person permitted to adapt a Stephen King story to the screen. He understands the genre, the characters (especially the secondary ones, which are something that King values in his books), and how to scare the bejeesus out of his audience.<br/><br/>I recently saw the special edition DVD, which features a cut of the film in black and white (Darabont's preferred version), and the lack of colour seriously helps the film. Black and white has an amazing ability to make CGI (which looks computer-animated, even when it's done right) look absolutely real - even when everything else does not. It also gives the film an eerie atmosphere that reminds me of classic shockers like Night of the Living Dead.<br/><br/>The only place this film lacks is the creatures themselves. This is more a criticism of King, than of Darabont, since they were fairly faithful to the original novella. They were a little too elaborate to seem like they came out of a natural eco-system (tentacles that eat people?... well, I guess anything's possible, but still...). That said, the dynamic between the poisonous bugs and their bird-like predators was interesting, and realistic enough.<br/><br/>The camera work in this film is something that is new to many films - especially one by Darabont (who has been compared to Kubrick due to his demand for control over his camera). Here, he threw control to the wind, and with the exception of the night-attack sequence, he didn't even storyboard. Since the cameras basically improvised, there were no restrictions on the actors, and many of them commented that it was the closest thing they'd experienced to stage-work on film. The result is a documentary-style film that puts us right in the middle of the action.<br/><br/>Probably one of the most effective things in this film is the realism, and I'm not talking about monsters, here (which were very elaborate; too much, some have commented). Instead, I'm talking about people's response to fear. In the space of two days, the inhabitants of the small town turn from a decent, civilized community, into a pack of religious zealots bent on blood sacrifice. For anyone who says this is too over the top, they probably have forgotten just how long it took for murders and looting to erupt during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.<br/><br/>And to cap it off, Darabont has written some of the most chilling scenes (added to the story) ever put on film, not the least of which is the ending, which I will not spoil for those who haven't seen it. King, who rarely likes it when people alter his work, has said that it is the ending he wishes he'd written. It just goes to show how much faith the two have in humanity... not much at all."
"duo_1002","Null","1","3","29 March 2008"," One of the best horror films of all time
","Frank Darabont not only nailed the transition from book to film to a tea (as he always has with Kings work) but did a masterful job directing it. What makes his work so good is that everything is subtle, the fine details are wrought and brought in and out of focus, literally, on film. This movie is riddle with symbolism and is a multi-layered film that is fantastic for symbolism The acting is good and in horror the horror movie perspective, maybe the best ensemble cast of all time. It's easy to grow attached to these characters as Darabont is brilliant at showing each characters humanity, all their flaws and strengths and their weakness. In a scene where Laurie Holden stomps on a bug she slips and Thomas Jane is rather clumsy when chasing a flying monster with a broom stick.<br/><br/>The ending may not be enjoyed by everyone but it's implications, the irony, the religious aspects, the heartbreak are simply subtle and impactful.<br/><br/>The special effects are well done and while it doesn't feel exactly real, it adds to the otherworldly atmosphere of the movie. While the action sequences only fill up a minor aspect of The Mist they were no doubt intense.<br/><br/>One of the best made horror movies of all time."

","I have just watched this film, and although I was not surprised by its averagely poor standard, as it seems that very few directors of this decade can actually produce a decent 'Sci-Fi/Horror'.<br/><br/>The film was not unwatchable, but lacked so much; there was no real build up of tension or fear in sections where this could have easily been explored and developed, the special effects were, by todays standards, relatively average, and on the whole, the film was predictable.<br/><br/>That is however, up until the ending, which is perhaps the films saving feature. Although along with the rest of the film, it could have been done a lot better, the ending was very clever.<br/><br/>All in all, if you have 2 hours to kill, watch this movie, but otherwise, do not go out of your way, you will be disappointed."

","I haven't seen a new good horror movie for quite a while. <br/><br/>I really like watching movies and lately I watch them very often. Average, I watch 20 movies per month. <br/><br/>New modern horror movies like Saw III, The Hills Have Eyes and Hostel 2 etc. can quite disappoint me. To be honest, I didn't expect much from The Mist when I went to watch it. I thought it would be a really bad cheap horror movie, but fortunately - I was wrong! I wouldn't actually call The Mist a horror. I would rather call it a thriller. <br/><br/>I really like the acting and the message about life, people and everything else that The Mist is sending to us. The characters are fully believable. Especially Thomas Jane. I haven't watched many films with him but in this film he is amazing. <br/><br/>Alright, the monsters and creatures can actually be funny instead of being terrifying like they should be.(at least to me) But the idea about the mist and something bad in it is quite good. If they made some alternative monsters or something else in the mist, this movie would be a masterpiece for me. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the ending is the best part of the whole movie. The ending actually forced me to register on IMDb and post a comment about The Mist. Amazing! I love the music. And the way how Thomas Jane is expressing his feeling's is one of the most realistic acting I have ever seen. <br/><br/>I recommend watching The Mist to everyone. I think you shouldn't regret it."

","From within the first few minutes I was hooked through to the end. It's been a while since there's been a really good sci-fi/horror combo - and here it is - from Stephen King, no less...<br/><br/>A mysterious mist shows up in a remote town, lots of military vehicles are seen speeding past, and shoppers in the town's grocery store become trapped when they realize that venturing into the mist is perilous. As the situation unfolds, fear begins to overtake logic.<br/><br/>One thing I also really liked was that I didn't feel cheated with a minimal ending - so this was a big plus for me. However, the one thing that took away from the movie was the prolonged stupidity of the characters in the face of danger. It wasn't really believable. But the movie was so good in other respects, I let this aspect slide a bit.<br/><br/>In general, this is a great movie to watch. Stephen King fans, sci-fi/horror fans and those that like thrills and suspense ... this is for you."

","If you read the book from Stephen King, you will be a bit surprised by the film. As in most cases, the movie sacrifices some elements of the written original and the ending is extended too. The book does not give any concrete ending for the story, only that they just keep on driving on and on. But: the films alternative ending compared to the original story shows such a drama! OK, we have seen scenes more dramatical, of course, but anyway! I always am sad, when I see, that there is another TV-version of a King story, because in most cases they are bad. Movies can also not always do their best, to reveal the depths of Kings mind, but in some cases they succeed. Do not pay attention to the sometimes bad CGI and you will find the highlights of the movie and the ""King-thrill"" materialized as a mist crawling among the seats of the theater, then up your legs and higher..."

","Tentacled beasties with snapping claws; insectivorous critters with poisonous stings; winged monstrosities that swoop from the sky; and hideous arachnids that shoot acidic strands of web: these are just some of the Lovecraftian creatures waiting to crush, tear, rip, and devour whoever should stray into The Mist.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of Stephen King's books: he has some great ideas, but I don't particularly enjoy his style of writing, and find that he tends to leave some of his stories a little too 'open-ended' for my liking. The Mist, however, is one (short) story of his which I thoroughly enjoyed. And director Frank Darabont's movie adaptation more than does it justice, delivering loads of scares, some great monsters, a fair smattering of gore, plenty of atmosphere, and adding an ending that'll leave you shell-shocked.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane plays David Drayton, one of a group of people (which includes Drayton's son Billy) who are trapped in a supermarket after a strange mistthe result of a top-secret government experiment gone wrongsuddenly envelops the building. When the frightened customers and staff realise that there is something unspeakable in the mist that wants to eat them, fear and panic turns them against one another.<br/><br/>Darabont's wonderful script is pretty faithful to King's original tale, (only omitting an admittedly unnecessary sex-scene and adding an inspired downbeat ending), and the great cast give gripping performances (particularly from Marcia Gay Harden, as a religious zealot convinced that the 'end of days' has arrived, and Jane as the artist-turned-hero).<br/><br/>The special effects and creature designs are very imaginative and, for the most part, pretty convincing (a few of the CGI effects could've been better, but I'm nit-picking). The score is also very good, especially at the end when a haunting melody perfectly complements the harrowing visuals.<br/><br/>The result is one of the best US horror films that I have seen in quite a while, and is one that should definitely not 'be mist' (be missedgeddit?)."

The non-human creatures are realistic and believable, the acting is enjoyable and the few ""shock scenes"" are helpful to keep the terror to an acceptable level. And what is a good story of terror without a Zealot or two? But the kicker with this film is that you can see where the story line is going to go, as with many modern films. You know the characters, you relate to them and you are sure of what their next actions will be. But where the story takes you, well, it is a train wreck, impossible to look away.

However, that drops to a 7/10 when you take the nihilistic ending into account. I was so let down by it that I had to visit the user comments on IMDb to find out if others were as disappointed as I am!<br/><br/>While I was reading, I learned that The Mist had been made by the same people who remade Halloween, and suddenly the bad ending made sense... Halloween was a mindless slaughter-fest with no redeeming qualities. I guess the amazing thing is that they managed to make such a sensitive and faithful adaptation this time around. But it's almost as if whoever was in control of the plotting on Halloween was not allowed to participate until the very end of this film, when he decided to wreak vengeance on his collaborators by destroying the amazing bond they'd established between the surviving characters. Hey, if even Stephen King was in awe of his callousness, then that says something! <br/><br/>I see lots of other people made similar comments about the ending; what bothers me is that the makers probably look at reviews like theirs and figure it's coming from mindless, Prozac-happy viewers with a self righteous disdain for 'depressing stuff'. I am writing this review because that is most definitely not the case with this film. A negative ending is not necessarily a bad one, except if it totally disrupts the flow of the film and makes no sense for the characters involved. Sadly, in this film the latter is definitely true.<br/><br/>Overall though, The Mist has a very tense, realistic and haunting atmosphere.

","Frank Darabont is a very good writer and director and the only person in the world who can tackle the difficulty of creating something believable out of Stephen King's books.<br/><br/>THE MIST is creepy, has some really good scenes here and there and terrific actors. I don't mind the religious stuff (I'm Swedish) and I don't care about the sad ending.<br/><br/>The good parts is that the actors are great, the build up and tension is strong, it's crystal-clear and doesn't really leave anything up to imagination.<br/><br/>It does have some drawbacks though. The first one is that it's a little bit dated. The Korean film THE HOST does everything this film does, but much better and much stronger. And it looks better too! This feels a little bit like Darabont dusted of a shelved film from the 80's (allthough with sfx from the late 90's).<br/><br/>It has a low budget, which also means you don't really go for any cool shots, cool locations or cool death scenes. Most is pretty basic.<br/><br/>But it works and it's actually scary sometimes. And it works the best when it tries the hardest to take itself serious and be realistic.<br/><br/>The absolutely biggest problem is the ending though. The realism stops ten minutes before the film does, and it feels rushed and not thought through at all. It feels like Darabont wrote the greatest ending in the world - and then someone else came in and told him he had to re-write it, three days before he had to shoot it and him being drunk while re-writing it. That's how the ending feels.<br/><br/>That's sad, because the rest of the film is super-realistic (even though we have monsters from other worlds crawling around) and mostly well done.<br/><br/>So, even though this is a basic, a bit-too-late film with great actors and nice touch - it falls short from being the masterpieces that Darabont usually creates. But it IS an in-between-films thing that he probably just made over a weekend with a couple of friends, since he wanted to make a movie. :)<br/><br/>Worth watching, at least once.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I read some reviews of this movie from 'serious' reviewers. The tendency was towards shallowness of plot and lack of credibility or explanation. I can't believe this. Decades on end I see Hollywood movies that are about having the right ingredients to earn money and suddenly they pick on this. But I saw why .. the director had a reputation from 'the green mile' and 'shawshank' so disappointment was around the corner. Consuming this movie for what it is, a unpretentious popcorn movie in which exaggerated human behavior under stress / shallow psychology is used as an extra entertainment factor I totally enjoyed myself. The only let-down for me was the sad ending which suggests some kind of pretentiousness after all, like it's some kind of tragedy/drama or something. I love the way tension is built up in this movie as much as I hate all the scream-like pseudo comical horror-movies from the past years."
"edgelake","9","1","3","14 March 2008"," Another great Stephen King adaptation by Darabont!
","I just finished watching The Mist and I just had to write something about it at once. <br/><br/>First of all I read the short story by Stephen King many years back and it scared the heck out of me and at the same time moved me with it's characters. And they are also the movies strongest point, they have depth and act in a very humane way i.e. very differently to the terrible things that are going on around them.<br/><br/>Darabont has taken Kings story and enhanced it for the better. I always have a trace of doubt when I'm about to watch a King adaptation because of all the horrible once out there and even though Darabont has succeeded with his earlier adaptations I had it before seeing The Mist. But my God was I relieved! This is a horror movie with something unusual as depth, you really care for and relate to the characters. And the ending wrapped up the whole feeling of the film perfectly, it's a knock out!<br/><br/>Watch it now!"

","**CONTAINS SPOILERS** this isn't a review, just feel like expressing my ideas after seeing the movie!<br/><br/>I must say that for a horror movie, this does deliver. I was once a huge fan of horror, but Hollywood did a great job of destroying it, and creating the big cliché that we have nowadays of bunch of high-school kids getting brutally murdered. The fact that this is a Stephen King based story it is very nice. Though I haven't read the novel, i am pretty sure that the story didn't end that way! Call me crazy, but people who are bright enough to foresee a mini clan getting larger in the market, and then deciding that suicide is the answer just doesn't add up. I am all for bad endings, but something reasonable, I think a movie like Armageddon should have ended in a Big Bang lol, considering how much they screwed up! But a father shooting his own son when he is merely a painter, yup, thats not in the psyche of your everyday artist let me tell you. Aside from the disturbing ending the whole movie was great, could have beefed up the graphics a little though. and personally i think the biggest horror to me were the radicals more than the monsters. I think you can expect more threat from these radicals than from a group of monsters you know are out to get you."
"NormanCroucher","7","1","3","11 March 2008"," Enter The Mist
","Okay, I'm about to suggest something that is a complete oxymoron here, but what Frank Darabont delivers with ""The Mist"" is an intelligent horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. If anyone knows how to adapt the King, it's Darabont. The man always tells an awesome tale when he uses King's stories as his templates (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) and this here, their fourth collaboration together, continues the love affair to the exemplary standard we have grown accustomed.<br/><br/>Darabont is one of those master filmmakers who expertly crafts character and story to completely draw you in to the magic of cinematic atmosphere. What he accomplishes here is reminiscent of classic Hollywood horror, when it was more about the people reacting to the horror and less about the spectacle pf the horror itself. ""The Mist"" refuses to be your basic creature feature, or gory monster hack 'n' slash. It keeps its head throughout the mounting crisis' while remaining unpredictable (for the most part) and keeping things on the slow burn flame of tension. What's more is that the cast is exceptionally good. And I don't just mean simply in terms of a fine ensemble of quality support actors filling out the roles of the besieged townsfolk, I mean every performance is mannered and refined to the degree where you believe in them whole heartedly. There is not one bad egg amongst them. How very rare. Thomas Jane proves playing an everyman lead can be more than simply a thankless task as he keeps the balance of believability of a normal guy thrust into an extraordinary battle for survival. No out-of-the-blue shotgun heroics here. He simply reacts as many Fathers would under similar circumstances. Very controlled and very impressive. But the real plaudits must go to Marcia Gay Harden as the crazed religious zealot who rallies in the name of a most disturbing God for a sacrifice to prove they are worthy of entry into the pearly white gates of oblivion. She pretty much steals the show. Andre Braugher, with shorter screen time, also nabs a ""why isn't he in bigger roles"" award, demonstrating some brilliant thesping abilities during the early chaotic scramble to understand just what lies outside in the mist. But as I said, this is an ensemble piece and Jeffery DeMunn, Bill Sadler and Toby Jones are just as good.<br/><br/>What struck me beyond the performances was the remarkable thought put into the situation that unfolds. This story is about human fear and weakness. It's about what happens when we're all alone, in the dark, with no hope of rescue and what effect that has on different types of people. The best scene in the film takes place as a conversation between some of the core group that reflects these themes about what people will resort to when they are afraid and desperate to be saved. The subtext is subtle but still dominant enough for the story to be considered allegorical of modern day America with The Mist symbolic for not just the unknown, but fear itself. The script splinters characters into separate, opposing camps, each vying for leadership and control. Again this sparks to life the idea that there are underlying messages and metaphors within ""The Mist"" that comment on contemporary American culture, ranging from religion to social class.<br/><br/>Darabont's non-showy, almost laidback direction allows a fluid camera to drift quite elegantly through the scenes, slowly conjuring the foreboding without ramming it in anyone's face. The subtleties in the music score compliment the visuals, so no blaring orchestral emphasis every time something frightening is about to happen. It all blends efficiently to make this seem less like a horror and more like a character piece. The CGI is admittedly less impressive than the rest of it but thankfully the special effects are sparingly used. The set-pieces themselves occasionally stumble because of such a wide character canvas to cover but for the majority of the film it all pays-off the slow building tension nicely. Plus, lack of explicit gore makes for a welcome change from all these inane torture porn fests we keep on getting. Finally a horror movie the grandparents might enjoy too. Don't let that put you off it though.<br/><br/>If you have read anything on ""The Mist"" then you may know that the ending has been widely criticised. The reason? I ain't telling, except to say it is quite possibly the bleakest Hollywood ending in years. Frank Darabont's anti-Shawshank resolution but with the same message: Never give up hope. This is an elegantly produced supernatural horror that is about people rather than monsters, reminiscent of ""The Birds"" and ""Night of the Living Dead."" ""The Mist"" is a remarkable entry into the modern Hollywood horror cannon. As in; it's actually a good movie. Sincerely recommended."

"ive_been_expecting_you","8","1","3","10 March 2008"," A genuinely frightening, well made horror film
","You've only got to look at the poster to see this isn't quite your average fare when it comes to horror movies. Granted, it has a credibility boost what with a story by Stephen King and the direction and screen writing of Frank Darabont (both of whom as most know are responsible for The Shawshank Redemption) but it's the notion of simplicity which makes The Mist so entertaining.<br/><br/>There's no elaborate death-trap setups that eventually became irritating in Saw, no creepy, pale Japanese children running around behind frosted glass, just good old fashioned shocks. The principle is simple enough. A small town in anywhere America becomes engulfed by a unsettling mist. A very broad mix of people; the hero American dad, the ever so overbearing Bible basher (Marica Gay Harden is fantastic here) and a group of rednecks truckers all lock themselves within a glass fronted superstore ... and they wait ... and wait. <br/><br/>Of course there's reason enough to go outside (someone wants a shotgun from their car, some irresponsible mother's left her children playing with guns at home etc. etc) and gradually the bodies to pile up. What sets this apart, however is it's played as a very real scenario - the actions the characters take, in particular Thomas Jane, who seems to get better with each passing role don't seem played for dramatic effect and seem much more the result of sheer terror, and it's this that gives the eventual arrival of the CGI monsters much more potency.<br/><br/>If you're of the Saw / Hostel / Scream mentality, there won't be much here for you to get excited about I'm afraid. If, however you like your horror movies taut, frightening and original, give The Mist a go!"
"davinholms","8","1","3","8 December 2007"," a closer look
","It's funny if you look closely at the comments of those who liked the ending, they all focus on the emotional impact and the wow factor. But those who hate the ending all focus on logic and storytelling points. I even saw where one pro ending poster called every one who didn't like the ending, wussies. Hey good argument bud, big points to the deep thinker. <br/><br/>Truth is you must see the movie as a whole piece of work and not get excited by a shocking ending, while disregarding the progression of the piece thus far. Thomas Jane's character would not act as you might, or as the director might. He will act in accordance with his character, which has been to keep going, to keep trying. There is no impetus in the land rover scene to push beyond the bounds of his character. Even when he saw his dead wife he grieved for a moment then drove on. This is a type A personality and they don't just give into despair because they are out of gas. Heck, there was a time when man lived in the wild full of vicious predators for ages and it was people like Thomas Jane's character who insured the survival of the species.<br/><br/>The director did not earn this ending. If Darabont wanted this ending he should have shown a gradual descent on Jane's character's part. (for a great example of how this is done properly see ""Descent"") but since this was not done, then the ending becomes a cheap shot to get a knee jerk emotional reaction. Which obviously worked but hey people, the Emperor isn't wearing any cloths.<br/><br/>I loved the movie, ditch the ending and it works as one of the best horror movies I have seen in a while. And, no I do not like cookie cutter, all is well endings. I just think if you want a tragic poignant ending you must work your characters in that direction and in this case Darabont betrayed the integrity of his own film to force his message. <br/><br/>The worst part is that Darabont is to intelligent not to know it."

The scene in the loading dock for instance, when Norman gets attacked, why can't anyone manage to cut the tentacles that are grabbing at poor Shermanator's body, but as soon as the thing is leaving everybody has an axe. <br/><br/>How about the scene where the bugs breach the window, doesn't anyone know how to operate a lighter?....well one guy did, he lit the mop, the floor, himself....

"mjbat7","1","2","10","25 March 2008"," Unoriginal and anti-climactic
","Like most horror movies, The Mist is a moral tale about the nature of man. In this endeavor it fails. As a scary film, it is similarly limited. Most simply, there is nothing to this film; no central meaning of any value, no original monsters, situations or even effects. The film does not scare you; if it were not so disappointingly over stated, it would be funny, but it isn't. This film should not have been made and ought not to be viewed by anyone with intact sensory organs. <br/><br/>Most obviously this ""horror"" film is supposed to represent the ""horror"" of mans own nature. The characters fall into appallingly predictable parts as generic stereotypes of mans behavior under the influence of fear. This same plot has been carried out time and time again elsewhere, to a better and more interesting degree. On this count, The Mist achieves little more than an after school special about kids who sneak out of home only to get locked in a shed/mine/warehouse, after which point, the kids are morally categorized by their ability to keep their wits and integrity under pressure.<br/><br/>The film rushes to its conclusions about the nature of man in a reckless fashion. Plot devices are installed too quickly, there was no attempt made at suspense, and the moral statements it made, though underlined tirelessly, were laughable and inconsistent.<br/><br/>One's laughter could continue past the moral/existential goal of the film, and right on into the films attempt at horror. The monsters were often plagiarized (for example, the spiders lair in the pharmacy could be replaced by clips from the Alien franchise). The events of the film were neither shocking nor scary; the predictable dispatch of the sherminator was downright hilarious. Every event of the film was heralded well in advance by clues which were too obvious to allow for suspense. One is tempted to think that the creators of this film decided to forgo horror to focus on the message of the film. The message was this: If you let fear get the best of you, you do stupid things, even when you're not panicking, and you can't avoid it, so there! You should just go about your business until the great and unjustly criticized American war machine valiantly defeats all evil with unexplained and miraculous ease.<br/><br/>One could criticize this film all day, from all angles, and not grow short on flaws to examine. If it had not taken its self so seriously as a fable of morality, this film could have risen in a few years, to the status of a cult icon, in a similar league to snakes on a plane. The deepest circles of hell should be reserved for the makers of such boring anti-climaxes. For your own health and the health of your loved ones, DO NOT VIEW THIS FILM. Do not view it in seriousness or as a joke. There is no place for a work of such ridiculous anti-climax, so filled with dramatic, awe inspiring, but ultimately hollow imagery, in either modern cinema, video stores, or personal film collections."

","I felt excited about seeing this as I'd adored the short story (the film cites it as a novella) when I was a kid, and for the most part the film didn't disappoint. The film capitalizes wonderfully on how powerful your imagination can be sparking up fear and tension when you can't see what's going bump and howl outside. The added bass sounds from the overly loud theater next door actually enhanced the experience.<br/><br/>***SPOILER - However, after seeing the preview screening last night, and hearing the crowd's general reaction to the ending, I hope that there is an alternate final reel of this film to swap in before the film releases generally. If there isn't a replacement for the final reel, and you hear the comment about how there are only four bullets left, snatch your jacket and head out of the theater to safely depart with nothing but largely positive feelings about the experience dancing in your noggin. Otherwise, likely you'll feel cheated, as in, why should I have cared, because the ending doesn't have precident and is simply too cruel to suit the tone of the film that preceded it. Similar to the original ending to Clerks, if you've seen that depressing and ultimately empty attempt at cruel irony from the DVD's bonus menu. END SPOILER*** ***CREATURE DESCRIPTION SPOILERS - The creatures are generally well introduced and although herald from easily recognizable influences, they're the right influences, like Geiger, Half-Life 2, Eight Legged Freaks, and your usual suspects from the insect, arachnoids, and crustacean realms, with a dash of wonderful Cthulhu teethed tentacle action to set the bar early. Though there were brief points when lighting didn't match between the CGI and the practical, for the most part the composites were well done, further, there was enough juxtaposition of particle props and CGI during the midst of the more action packed scenes to keep the experience dynamic and gratifying. END CREATURE DESCRIPTION SPOILERS*** The film's cadence ramps well, although if you haven't seen the trailer yet, don't, as its a spoiler for some key beats best left a surprise.<br/><br/>Andre Braugher does an excellent job bringing his elitist lawyer personae to life, and Marcia Gay Harden deserves an award or at least public kudos for doing for this film what Kathy Bates did for Misery.

","Okay so here's the deal. I love the director of this film and the work he did on Shawshank Redemption. Also, I LOVE the book the Mist and the audio CD. I got all of my friends into the story back in eight grade. During our art class we talked about how we were going to make this into a movie, little kids dreaming big. So four years later here is the movie. I obviously am holding high standards for this movie, and I'm not expecting it to be good. And on opening night my best friend (whom I got into it) and I went to see it. It was done EXTREMELY well. The special effects weren't great by any means, but the tension was there. When the mist rolled into the parking lot of the super market, I felt my heart stop. Also, I felt like I was at home, and for once a Stephen King horror story was done right. It was done faithfully to the book, and it got to the point where I found myself reciting lines before they even happened. But it gets better. The audiences' reactions to the characters made me proud to have been a fan of the story! How you ask? They laughed when a character said something funny, and they applauded when someone stepped up, and justice was served (you Mist fans might know what I'm talking about, and if you don't, you will, trust me). Now, one more thing to note is the ending. It's TOTALLY different from the ending of the book/Audio CD. Its hard to interpret. I loved it because it points out that life isn't fair, and it's okay to express that in movies. I hated it because its like a slap in the face. It made me depressed because it made me ask myself ""what if?"". It made me laugh because it just turned out so... blegh. It will leave you with more questions coming out than going in. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Whether or not you've read the Mist, go see this movie. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I went in with reservations, and I came out surprised."

Second, while this is certainly not a monster movie in any sense of the phrase's colloquial usage, it brilliantly manages to juxtapose thoroughly preternatural events without compromising the perceived realism of the charactersa feat that is so rarely accomplished in Hollywood Darabont deserves accolades in full chorus. This film is not like the Shawshank Redemption, or even the Green Mile, but much more like Pan's Labyrinth in the sense that it is a horror movie for adults: it doesn't have the cheap thrills of Sam Raimi schlock and I can't imagine that the film's pace or ending will be particularly satisfying to those with short attention spans or who demand American-styled formulaic plots. My wife and I are huge horror buffs, and we both stunned by this film; my jaw literally dropped and my wife began to sob. The film hits you on a visceral level, and I am sure many people will end up hating it for this very reasonit is by no means a ""date movie."" I don't want to sound too pedantic, but I would not recommend this movie to everyone; though it is an absolutely fantastic film, it requires some psychological preparation on the part of the viewer.

"Theo Robertson","8","1","4","14 April 2015"," Misanthropic Mini Masterpiece
","This is yet another film I've been wanting to see for a while and yet never got round to it . Based on a novella by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont who also brought THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE GREEN MILE to silver screen THE MIST opened to wide acclaim but underperformed at the box office and eight years later it remains the last feature film to be released by Darabont <br/><br/>!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! <br/><br/>Let's be honest here . The premise is frankly ridiculous . A bunch of middle Americans get trapped in a supermarket by a mist that hides murderous monsters . I think that's been produced by the Syfy Channel a few times . Add in a little kid and a religious maniac and you've almost got a full house - or rather supermarket - of walking , talking clichés and yet THE MIST is more than efficient at being a claustrophobic horror movie where we don't see is much scarier than what we do . Some people might be put off by the slow portent pace and talkative scenes but it's nice to see a horror movie that doesn't rely on cheap shock tactics all the time and makes you think . There's also an element of misanthropic cynicism building as the story goes along I should have also watched this when it came out since I recently found out how the movie ends . The ending itself is memorable but for me the greatest scene is just before this that hints the human race might be superseded by unaware leviathans from another dimension worthy of the best works of HP Lovecraft <br/><br/>There is a slight spanner in the works and that is some of the CGI is bloody awful in places , especially the initial monster attack that does tend to take you out of the movie . It's more puzzling as to why it's so bad since it's a studio picture and budget shouldn't have been a major obstacle and in some scenes you'd be forgiven you are indeed thinking you're watching a Syfy production . Regardless of this THE MIST is on the whole a creepy , tense horror movie . Compare this to the not dissimilar movie MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE that uses King as a source and you can see how badly THE MIST could have turned out"

","King is a lousy, hack writer, true, but he puts out the odd interesting story every few years.

True, there is attempt at social commentary with characters so shallow you could use them as tracing paper - that's a classic King'ism. His characters are only the lines they speak, never anything more - they have no back stories, no lives, no solidity, no believability, and no consistency.<br/><br/>But that ending was apparently entirely the director's idea.<br/><br/>So... after making us sit through the usual King tripe, rooting for the aliens (damn, those bugs were beautiful, and fascinating - where's David Attenborough when you need him), putting up with the completely forced and ridiculous ""social situation"" fiction ... they try to have an ironic ending.<br/><br/>And then try to legitimise it with one of DCD's most over-used tracks (think this makes the .... no, seriously, the sixth - with a 6 - feature film I've heard 'The Host Of Seraphim' used in).<br/><br/>MENDOZAAAAAAAAAAAA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.................<br/><br/>- <br/><br/>-- <br/><br/>---"

Reminds you of the saying, being scared of something is one thing, but being in the company of many who are more scared than you is another. Preferring to be scared of what they know, rather than what they understand, appears to work/unite them at least, though the downside to others is that they fear/blame you.

"user-543-975655","8","1","4","22 June 2013"," A Great Horror Movie and Definitely Worth Seeing! (My first review)
","This is my first review on IMDb. Probably not a lot of people will find this review helpful, but know that I am no genius with reviews yet.<br/><br/>This was a great movie and had a great plot, since it was based off of Stephen King's ""The Mist"" novella. The acting was exceptional, especially for the kid actors, if any. It was really believable throughout the movie, except for one scene where everything sounded bad. I guess I'll start out with all of the general comments about the acting. Nathan Gamble and Thomas Jane made a good Father & Son relationship. It did make me cringe in some scenes though. Laurie Holden and Marcia Gay Harden did a great acting performance playing two people who dislike each other greatly. Toby Jones also did a great job acting as short but tough store bag-boy Ollie Weeks. The extras were also great in their own aspect. They looked frightened when they were supposed to and the lines they had, if any, were delivered just like they should be. Nathan Gamble was also in some other movies like The Hole, which he did a great job in, also. How is he so good at acting at only 10-13 years old? <br/><br/>Frank Darabont also did a great job directing and writing this film. He made it so that the viewers weren't given a headache from all the shakiness of found footage horror films, like V/H/S or the Blair Witch Project. And yet the camera wasn't completely still and zoomed in on important objects. The cinematographer of this movie did a fantastic job. Important objects were never lost, and it looked like someone was running behind them very steadily. By that I mean the camera angles.<br/><br/>But aside from the general comments on the movie, I'll say some specific stuff about the movie. One of my very few complaints is the actual 'Mist'. It looks like it had come out of a fog machine, and if you have no idea where the Mist came from, why would you go out in and not be poisoned? Better phrased, why would you risk it? If someone did go out there, I wouldn't want it to be me. The writing of the movie was also great, and had just the right lines for just the right actors. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a fantastic Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller movie and would definitely watch it again."
"BeneCumb","7","1","4","25 February 2013"," Not an ordinary monster movie... And with even cast
","Usually, I am not a big fan of Stephen King's works as they are too much focused on changes in people's minds - I tend to prefer fight with expressed evil. The Mist combines the two elements in a gifted manner: there are both evil creatures, and ordinary people whose minds are affected by tensions, uncertainty and ignorance. Moreover, Mrs. Carmody's character (splendidly performed by Marcia Gay Harden) demonstrates the consequences of any religious fanaticism combined with strong persuasion skills. Generally, the real horror here lies in the unpredictability of human mind and behavior.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it is evenly strong, the absence of A-category actors makes all the supporting roles evenly watchable and important (Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, David Jensen, Nathan Gamble, above all). The leading character David Drayton (performed by Thomas Jane) seems less credible to me - painters / poster artists have usually no arrangement or commanding skills and do not become heroes in a short time.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is a good horror movie. And the ending is also with a twist, letting you torment long after the credits appear."

"ScottAmundsen","8","1","4","11 November 2012"," Mostly Faithful and Genuinely Chilling Adaptation of Stephen King Novella
","""The Mist"" was one of the first Stephen King novellas I read, back when it was first published in 1980, and I loved every creepy page of it. I've been waiting decades for a film version, and having finally seen it, I was for the most part highly impressed.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont, a director whose association with King is a long and fruitful one (THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION; THE GREEN MILE), is familiar with the writer's plan of attack and his tone, but this is Darabont's first foray into one of King's flat-out horror stories, and he not only hits the ball on the first pitch, he knocks it almost clear out of the park.<br/><br/>Before I go any farther I should note that despite similarities of title, this film (and the story upon which it is based) bear no resemblance to John Carpenter's 1980 film THE FOG; in fact the two stories, while both excellent, are remarkably different.<br/><br/>After an unusually violent storm on a lake in Maine, commercial artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his young son Billy (Nathan Gamble in a performance that should have gotten an Oscar nomination) head into town to stock up on supplies at the local supermarket; the power is out and there are things they need. As they are departing their next-door neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), an out-of-towner (the Draytons are year-round residents) decides to ride along, so they climb into David's four-wheel drive vehicle (Looks like a Jeep Cherokee but it isn't named so far as I know) and head into town, leaving David's wife Steff (Kelly Lintz) at home.<br/><br/>As they drive into town, it is revealed that the previous year there had been a lawsuit between Drayton and Norton when a tree limb crashed into the Draytons' boathouse; the Draytons won the suit and Norton holds a grudge, but he is recently widowed and the subject is not elaborated upon. They also discuss the Arrowhead Project, some kind of military operation that is the subject of much talk in the town, though no one knows exactly what it is.<br/><br/>They soon find out. Arriving at the supermarket, they make their way inside and are milling about with about half the town's population when suddenly several people near the front windows take note of the thick mist rolling in. Shortly after that a man comes charging into the store, face covered in blood, screaming that ""something in the fog"" took a friend of his and he heard him screaming.<br/><br/>The mist soon completely obscures the view of the parking lot, and the people inside the store become quite naturally uneasy. And it gets worse in fairly short order: suddenly, the entire store shakes as if a massive earthquake has taken place. And before too long they discover that there are...things...out there in the mist. Living things. Things right out of your worst nightmares. The visual horrors range from a creature with multiple tentacles to foot-long insects that look made of stainless steel to vaguely pterodactyl-like flying things that eat the insects, other nightmarish creatures only seen through the haze. The visual effects are first-rate; I should warn you: if you're phobic about either insects or spiders, this one may not be for you.<br/><br/>At one point David goes in the back to get a furniture pad to use as a blanket for his son; the store generator's exhaust is plugged and the back room is filling with fumes. Three store employees decide to send one stock boy out to unclog the exhaust. David, who has heard noises outside, tries to talk them out of it, but they are determined, and the stock boy ends up being the mist's first casualty as one of the many-tentacled nightmares carries him off.<br/><br/>Back in the store and badly shaken, David and store employee Ollie Weeks (Toby Jones) attempt to tell the others what has happened. David chooses Brent Norton as a potential leader, but Norton, to David's utter horror, chooses to believe that they are playing some sort of trick on him, and refuses to listen. Town Selectman Dan Miller (Jeffrey DeMunn) and schoolteacher Irene Reppler (Frances Sternhagen) soon come to David's side, as does Amanda Dunfrey (Laurie Holden), a married woman about David's age with a husband at home, who just happens to have a gun in her purse, for what that may be worth.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the town crazy woman, Mrs Carmody. Stephen King uses religious themes often in his works, and he is particularly fond of religious extremists. Margaret White in CARRIE was his first major religious fanatic character, and Mrs Carmody is a darker and more Old Testament twist on Margaret White. Played to a fare-thee-well by Marcia Gay Harden in a performance that was robbed at Oscar time, Mrs Carmody becomes the driving force behind the decision to try to escape.<br/><br/>As King adaptations go, THE MIST is one of the best ever filmed. My only complaint is they changed the ending. I won't spoil it except to say that the novella's ending leaves a lot of loose ends, with the survivors' fate left in doubt. The film ties up all the loose ends and provides the story with a resolution, but it is an unsatisfactory one in my opinion and the tantalizing open ended finale of the novella was far better.<br/><br/>This is a minor quibble, however, as I am only talking about the last ten minutes or so of what otherwise is a great horror flick."

","Don't read this if you haven't seen it but still intend to.<br/><br/>Have had the bad habit for a good few years of letting ""professional"" critics and Metacritic do my research for me.<br/><br/>I remember this movie coming out to ordinary reviews. As someone who had long enjoyed the writing of Stephen King, I vaguely remembered the original story as being part of a collection of shorts , or ""novellas"" as King always called them.<br/><br/>After seeing so many filmed versions of Kings stories that hopelessly fell short of whatever I had imagined in my mind, I had already decided against ruining my memories of whatever I classed as his great stories.<br/><br/>Apart from ""Misery"" it had always been slim pickings. I had decided against seeing ""The Shining"" despite its reputation because I presumed it would be more a great Kubrick film than the story I read.<br/><br/>So after seeing the bland reviews for this movie I was happy to pay it no mind. It would be just another cash-in from idiot producers who had purchased the rights to one of many King stories.<br/><br/>My biggest mistake was being jaded enough to see the name ""Frank Darabont"" attached to it yet still ignoring it.<br/><br/>It will not be for everyone but it is a fantastic movie. It is a great story, told exceptionally well. The narrative is excellent, the characters are presented in way that is a credit to both the actors and the writers and the star Thomas Jane makes a mockery of those who have snootily knocked him in the past.<br/><br/>I would say that whoever made the film only had x amount of dollars to spend on the special effects (98% of the movie is set within a confined place), and they should be proud of both the special effects and how effectively they were incorporated.<br/><br/>Knowing that someone gushing with praise for a film can inadvertently diminish expectations, I have noted this review as having spoilers. I am sorry if anyone reads this beforehand and is disappointed; I am just trying to convey how good this movie is when you view it with diminished expectations. And, yes, the irony of that last sentence is not lost on me.<br/><br/>Here's hoping that others saw the movie under similar circumstances and agree with my sentiments."
"gattonero975","8","1","4","23 October 2012"," ""Misty""
","Wow. What a movie. I had never seen this one when it came out in 2007 so it was a treat to finally see it in 2012. I've begun to watch a lot of Frank Darabont stuff lately; 'The Walking Dead, The Green Mile, ...ect...<br/><br/>It was a funny treat to me and I'm guessing for 'Walking Dead' fans also, to see many of the cast of that series on this film! But then it should not come as to no surprise as Darabont like to use people he has worked with often. Another thing is that this film was done in 2007. WD in 2010. So it's really unfair to compare but it's fun nonetheless. Like the scene were Laurie Holden and Jeffrey DeMunn are standing side by side and talking about a gun, it's funny to me because here they act clueless about it yet on WD Laurie's character, 'Andrea' , is the best shot they have!! Priceless! Anyways, on about The Mist. Thomas Jane, who to me looks like a more gentle-looking Christopher Lambert, did an OK job. It now makes me wonder how he would have handle the 'Rick Grimes' character of 'The Walking Dead instead of Andrew Lincoln. maybe he could show up later as Rick's long-lost brother or something.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden plays the religious-fanatic loony Mrs. Carmody. What is truly scary is that there are people like that in real life! I found it ironic that when she got killed, she was laying in the position like of Jesus on the cross.<br/><br/>Laurie Holden (Andrea of WD) had a OK role as the new teacher in town and playing surrogate mother to Jane's kid. There's a hint of mutual attraction between her and Jane's character but , they are both married and just keep it to looks.<br/><br/>Andre Braugher payed his role rather well as Jane's neighbor, 'Brent Norton'. A disbeliever who feels out of place in this hick town and has a hard time believing anyone but himself. Too bad we are never sure what happens to him and the crew he took with him. They just disappeared into the Mist .<br/><br/>Toby Jones was my favorite. playing one the employees of the supermarket. i liked how even though small in stature , he stood tall and brave. I especially liked him shooting the religious nut-case Mrs. Carmody. But then that's wrong because just because someone completely believes in their own religion or faith doesn't make them bad. but maybe dangerous. Her death by Toby's 'Ollie' Makes a statement on how easily some people are manipulated and coursed to do things they normally would not do. I believe Stephen King was making a big statement about religion. But then again, Jesus was crucified and killed for being a ""religious fanatic' to some and people were shocked to see how many followed Him. Just like in a way the people in the store started following Mrs.Carmody.<br/><br/>William Sadler, one of my favorite actors, to me played a wussy role at first. It was so out of context as I'm used to seeing him play more characters with more panache. In the end though he started to come to life as a follower of Mrs. Carmody.<br/><br/>Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale from WD) was OK a the man who 1st says there is something in The Mist. Frances Sternhagen was a hoot as the old lady ready to hit Mrs. Carmody with pea cans! Sexy Alexa Davalos was just a pretty check-out cashier who ends up getting stung by a alien hybrid wasp-like creature and dies a painful death. Her would-be boyfriend military Sam Witwer(another WD member:He was the soldier zombie in the tank on the very 1st episode!)who also dies a painful death, because the people are scared and believe the military is guilty because Mrs, Carmody says so, therefore is 'punished' and 'sacrificed '. Melissa McBride(WD's Carol)basically plays a eerily character she would somewhat play exactly on The Walking Dead! Brian Libby,another one of my favorite, plays a biker dude who is brave but that doesn't make a difference in The Mist. Brian is one of Darabonts favorites also because he uses him in all his films! And last but not least, Juan Gabriel Pareja(another WD member Morales) plays a character also named 'Morales' also!! He is a military guy who doesn't have much to do and his big scene is committing suicide off-camera."

But this is beside the point Darabont's focus on the human reaction to the breakdown of social constructions and descent to their primal nature was refreshing earnest and well formulated with the help of very good character actors (again would of work well in a TV setting.) This was no doubt the driving force for behind Darabont being commissioned 'The Walking Dead' by AMC (which by the way was one of the finest first seasons of TV there's been in along while) (second season after Darabont departed.. not so much.) In conclusion very decent effort as film, still think it would of made one hell of a series!"

But having 90% of the survivors joining her and stabbing a young adult for sacrifice was just plain ridiculous! Completely ruined the film especially when everyone in the town knew she was ""unstable"" already. The ending was all too quick too and would have been much more emotional if stretched out a bit longer. Also little plot holes like the dog food barrier by the window; there was a whole pallet of dog food left in the back room when they take the woman who took an overdose in there, why didn't they build the wall a little higher?!

","The Mist, for some reason, has a reputation of being a love/hate. Some people hate it and some don't. Personally, I love it. The plot is that a mysterious mist is covering up most of this small town and everybody hides out in a super market to try and survive. Now this is what made the movie work for me; it's like Night of the Living Dead, it's not about the monsters outside the super market it's about how people react to a situation like this. But unlike Night of the Living Dead where the zombies are all trying to get into the house, the monsters in the film don't try to get into the store because they're not that smart, they're just mutated animals. The acting is mixed in my opinion but the suspense is unbelievable. The special effects aren't anything special but that doesn't matter in a story like this. Marcia Gay Harden plays a religious nut who turns everybody in the store against the protagonist, and you just want to see her get chomped into oblivion! And then of course there's that ending, of course I'm not going to spoil it but it's one of the most sadistic, evil, depressing, mean, hateful, biggest slaps in the face endings ever. I'll leave it at that. But that doesn't matter, I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end and I never thought that it was stupid or lame. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. Not to be confused with John Carpenter's The Fog."

","Very good film ,scary throughout from starting till few seconds before climax ,I give it rating 6 out of 10 because of its scariness from staring. Acting was pretty good specially of the main characters such as Mrs. Cormody, actor and the son .I will give 2 points for the acting of all the actors. Therefore till now the points are 8. I will appreciate the imagination of the writer ""STEPHEN KING"" for such a good theme.I will give 2 points more for such a good story. Therefore till now the points are 10 out of 10. But I didn't liked the ending or climax , ""IT WAS BAD"" and heart breaking.Therefore I will give it -2 for its ending. The points are now 8 out of 10. THESE ARE THE FINAL MARKS. I will not appreciate the makers of this movie as they adopted each and every single word from the story written by Stephen King and didn't put there minds on the movie but just adopted it as a whole from the novella THE MIST. So overall in this movie the acting is marvelous , scariness is exceptional , totally adopted, climax is unexpected and imagination is best."

","This is the first time EVER i am reviewing anything and this is the movie that has made me do it.<br/><br/>I had high hopes from this movie as it comes from such a wonderful director but i failed to understand what Mr. Frank Darabont was thinking when he made this movie, this movie is very much like ""The Happening"" (which goes without saying was another terrible movie from an esteemed director, M. Night Shyamalan) only worse.<br/><br/>There are so many irritating characters with irritating acting (e.g. Marcia Gay Harden, Andre Braugher, William Sadler & the list goes on & on), the whole acting & the story is very predictable and average, the plot is weak & monotonous, unnecessarily slow & you end thanking God when the movie finishes. It's one of those bizarre movies which you wished you hadn't watched.<br/><br/>Now, I can't compare it with the novel it is based on as i have never read a novel in my entire life but i do know as a fact that Stephen King is an excellent writer & Frank Darabont is an excellent director. The formula of combining these two has worked perfectly well in the past two instances in the shape of The Shawshank Redemption & The Green Mile but when it comes to the ""The Mist"" it has been a total disaster.<br/><br/>Fellas' regardless of all the wonderful ratings & the good comments of this movie i have given it 2/10 as it fails to meet even half of what was expected from it and i'd seriously and honestly suggest that you do not waste time on this.

","""The Mist"" is full of substance, action, thrill, drama and reality.

No big goofs, no discontinuities.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane (David Drayton) plays an incredibly hard role filled with so many emotions. He does it unlike other actors I've ever seen. Terrible tough decisions, mental stress, fear, interior drama, all packed in a single character, a husband, a friend, a dad who has to hide all of them for the sake of his close ones.<br/><br/>The whole movie is great to watch and it's a great exercise if you're trying to find out how the human mind works."

"ajs-10","7","1","4","1 April 2010"," Some of Stephen Kings scariest work
","First of all, I'll admit to being a fan of the work of Stephen King, like many others I have read, and enjoyed, a lot of his works. However, I had not read this particular story before watching this film. The setting is a small town in Maine where a powerful thunderstorm has just wreaked havoc and the townsfolk are just getting things back together.<br/><br/>David Drayton, an artist who designs movie posters for a living, leaves his wife at home and heads to the local town store. He has his son, Billy with him, along with neighbour Brent Norton. As they set off they notice a mist coming down from the hills and across the lake. There are a lot of Army personnel on the road headed out of town; they are from the base situated in the hills. On arrival at the store they go about their shopping, David tries the payphone since he cannot get any service on his mobile but it's not working either. All of a sudden, as the mist envelops the store an old man with a bloody nose runs in and tells the people there not to go outside. There's something in the mist and it took his friend. One man makes a run for his car but we only hear his screams. They are now trapped in the store with, who knows what outside. Already people are divided, local 'crazy' woman, Mrs. Carmody begins quoting scripture and David's neighbour, Brent begins trying to get people to make a run for it. David gets some help from teacher, Amanda Dunfrey; she looks after Billy while he tries to figure a way out with a store clerk, and friend, Ollie Weeks. When a young man is killed by something unworldly as he's trying to go outside at the back of the store, people still will not believe it's dangerous out there. A group of them try to get out but fail to get very far. The divisions in the group get wider the longer it goes on and Mrs. Carmody's cries of holy retribution get more and more fanatical followers. I really don't want to say too much more for fear of giving too much away, but I will say that David, Billy, Amanda and a few others do make an attempt to get outside.<br/><br/>It's a pretty well made film but some of the CGI wasn't top quality and did let it down slightly. It's quite a tense storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Decent performances from all of the main characters, Thomas Jane as David Drayton, Marcia Gay Harden was great as Mrs. Carmody, Laurie Holden as Amanda Dunfrey, Andre Braugher as Brent Norton and Toby Jones as Ollie Weeks.<br/><br/>As with a lot of Stephen King stories, this is a very character driven piece and as such it works pretty well. The only thing I find with it is that the characters are sometimes portrayed as a little too much larger than life. For instance, Brent Norton is a lawyer and is adamant that there is nothing harmful outside. Even after the young man is killed he will not go into the back of the store to see the evidence. He's convinced the locals are trying to play a prank on him, even after some others go back there and tell him they're telling the truth. But I digress. Of course, because it's a horror film, the people have to do the most stupid things possible to put themselves in harms way. But I'll overlook all these cliché moments mainly because there is a really good ending. And no, I'm not going to give it away. Over all, it's a little cliché in places, but stick with it, the ending is pretty unexpected: recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.4/10"
"Scott_Mercer","5","1","4","14 February 2010"," They Made Lots of Mist Takes To Make This Movie
","Does injecting what is essentially a B-level monster movie format with more refined and sublime concerns such the nature of death, the existence (or not) of God and the destructive aspect of religion elevate the B-level monster movie to something a little more significant, or degrade the high-toned philosophical musings into a mere gimmick employed to spice up a crappy monster movie? <br/><br/>The answer in the case of Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"" is a little bit of both, unfortunately. <br/><br/>It was an admirable attempt, in the tradition of the best episodes of ""The Twilight Zone."" Is the monster that creepy thing outside, or is the monster ourselves? Rod Serling was a master at writing set-ups like that, and making them believable...to the point where they still hold up to this day. <br/><br/>Like I said, I appreciate the attempt to inject that kind of refinement into a silly monster movie. However, in this case, it just doesn't work. Why not? I guess because that aspect was a little too heavy-handed, overwritten, and overacted. If everyone had just dialed everything back just a LITTLE bit, I would have been prepared to give this movie an 8.<br/><br/>As far as the ending goes, I understand that some of the other commenter were bothered by its seemingly nihilistic tone with no reason. <br/><br/>On this point, I must disagree. What happened at the end of the film made complete sense to me, with what I knew about the characters and where the story had gone up to that point. Too bad that movies like this can't have their endings left up the air in today's movie marketplace, and most must have a ""surprise twist"" ending. I breathed a sigh of relief that the big surprise twist wasn't anything STUPID, like it was all a dream or something like that. <br/><br/>But I still shake my head that some sort of ""ironic twist"" was required, and the film makers couldn't leave it open-ended, like Stephen King did in his novella.<br/><br/>Still in all, it was a good idea and Darabont builds everything up well, tension is thick, and the CGI monsters are well scary.<br/><br/>The other major reason I cannot give this film more than a 5 is that it is a total ripoff of the no-budget stinker ""The Slime People"" from 1962. It has the exact same set-up of people trapped in a grocery store while nasty beasties are outside, wandering around in a fog that has enveloped everything. Never mind Carpenter's ""The Fog,"" this one is the true wellspring. Not saying that King actively grabbed his story from a creaky old black and white movie. But everyone knows that sometimes certain things remain stuck in your brain for years until they pop up again for no reason: things you didn't remember you remembered. What I am saying is that King probably grabbed most of the story from ""The Slime People"" on a subconscious level. It was shown on TV many times during the time King was growing up. If you don't believe me on this point, please check out the reviews of ""The Slime People"" and you will see how right I am."
"matt_shute_07","9","1","4","5 February 2010"," A refreshingly suspenseful horror film
","The Mist is a relatively low-budget horror film that is fast-paced, absorbing, and full of suspense. Based on Stephen King's novella of the same title, this movie tells the tale of what happens when terrifying beasts from another dimension are unleashed (by a disastrous military experiment) upon Stephen King's familiar ""small town America"".<br/><br/>The story is set almost entirely in a supermarket, besieged by alien terrors lurking in an all-enveloping mist. We follow the plight of artist David Drayton (portrayed by Thomas Lane) and a group of other locals, stranded and struggling to survive both the monsters outside and the growing mass-insanity within the store. The latter is whipped up by a disturbed religious fanatic, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who uses the climate of fear to offer easy solutions and scapegoats, generating ever more hysteria and spiritual fervour in the credulous and the terrified.<br/><br/>With solid performances from the ensemble cast, a good balance of situational suspense and action, and a shock-ending, this is a refreshing change from the dreary torture-porn that passes for the horror-film genre lately. Well worth a look."
"mgmax","4","1","4","27 October 2009"," Even in black and white, a pedestrian mis(t)fire
","The one possibly distinctive thing about The Mist was shot down by the studio and can only be seen on the 2-DVD set: a black and white version. What looks like smog in the color version takes on a silvery menace of nothingness in black and white, and Darabont's intention here-- basically to make a Twilight Zone episode-- becomes clear and, at times, visually effective. Nevertheless, this is a misfire which owes most of its flaws to King's original story, but is not helped by Darabont's flat, unconvincing direction, which desperately needs a touch of Cloverfield-era rawness to transcend its TV movie feel. <br/><br/>The blue collar locals are caricatured as dimwits who are more or less instant prey for a religious nutcase; and possibilities for dramatic tension between characters with reasonable opposing views are tossed away (the most intelligent opponent of the hero is done away with quickly). Virtually all the speaking characters quickly wind up in the hero's camp (even though we've seen little reason in their characters why they're all so rationalist and others aren't)-- yet the logic or necessity of the hero's choices are not at all clear. <br/><br/>All that could be forgiven if the movie was... scary! Here we have to start with blame for King-- it's a real letdown that a mist that could have contained anything turns out mainly to have giant rubber bugs in it. The menace of the mist dissipates the moment we first see CGI tentacles. Add in the explanation eventually given for what's going on and this is Lovecraft Lite without a real sense of bottomless awfulness hiding in the Mist."

","A bunch of people in Maine are trapped in a supermarket by a mysterious mist that seems to have covered the entire region. It also seems that there are monsters in the mist that kill--but where did the mist and the monsters come from? And will the people ever escape? <br/><br/>This was based on a Stephen King novella which I've read a few times. The novella is overlong but good with some really gruesome sequences. The movie has the same problem--it's overlong but nowhere near as compelling as the novella. The script is just simply boring. The people talk on and on and ON about the same things again and again. After a while I started fast forwarding through the dialogue parts because they were so dull! Also Marcia Gay Harden is a superb actress but she gives one of her worst performances here. She's always preaching and is supposed to convince people that God is punishing them--but she continuously has a blank look on her face. Where's the emotion? I didn't believe her for one second.<br/><br/>On the plus side Thomas Jane and all the other actors are superb in their roles. Also the film has a few gruesome sequences--they're strong and really work on you. However all this can't change the problem that the film is too long and boring. Also the ending was needlessly depressing. Read the novella instead. I give this a 5."
"Dodger-9","10","1","4","13 September 2009"," A masterpiece
","***The following contains spoilers *** Great horror films are few and far between thanks to the fact many lazy film-makers stick to the tried and tested routine of unstoppable serial killers and rarely address more original ideas. Thankfully, writer/director Frank Darabont is a far more intelligent director who wisely returned to the rich source material of Stephen King for this stunning classic. Shot at breakneck speed on a modest budget, his movie features a terrific ensemble cast, a great script and nail-biting scenes. Luckily the weakest visual effects sequence, involving a tentacle in a supermarket loading bay, doesn't get in the way of the rest of the drama, and once that is out the way, the rest is a sheer roller-coaster ride. Much has been written about the ending, so i won't repeat it here. But just to say for a film-maker to opt for such a brave ending knowing it will affect box office takings takes some guts. Long after all those bleak horror movies with a happy ending have faded from the memory, The Mist will linger as a tribute to its incredible cast and crew. 10/10."

Questions: How is it that the people in the jeep never see or hear anything (for miles) such as the army fighting the monsters but the army is right behind them just moments before they commit suicide? Project Arrowhead?? How do the characters know the name of a top secret army research project? Why do the people in the store not hear the monster banging against the back door and then think it is joke especially after the ""earthquake""? Is the mist poisonous?

","Quite brave and upfront in a lot of ways, the most impressive feature of this movie is its honesty. People are a fragile bunch and have a lot of very peculiar character traits and beliefs. Several of these are used as clever devices to increase the tension.<br/><br/>While this is a creature-feature of sorts, the real horror of the film comes from the way some of the characters react to each other rather than how the creature attacks them. While characters aren't fleshed out as much as they could be, the important characters are relatively multidimensional.<br/><br/>The plot isn't particularly predictable and the ending winded me. To my mind it was rather effective, although I found it slightly unlikely - that is the way it happened! As far as the usual minutiae, the effects are good, very good in places. The acting is convincing and in some cases understated and impressive for it.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say the movie was an engaging and well made examination of how people fall apart in the face of the unknown.

","After seeing the trailer for this movie several times in the movies, I quickly decided I will not watch what seemed as horror junk to me at the time, mainly because apart from a few awesome exceptions, I am not a true horror fan. I mean hey, why would anyone pay 10 bucks to sit on the edge of their seat for 90 minutes? Things quickly changed when a group of my mates bullied me into watching this, and I have to say it was the best bullying I've endured to this date! 'The Mist' is the motion picture adaptation of the diabolically smart horror novel written by the great Stephen King, and influenced by the artistry of the great Zdislaw Beksinki. <br/><br/>The movie kicks off in a rather mediocre expected manner, but when a freak storm unleashes the fiends of hell, a small town supermarket becomes the only refuge to a group of people who quickly form a survival colony.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, issues of morality and human behavior dominate, as Frank Darabont delivers some of the best movie directing seen all year. Monsters, creatures of the dark and mutated life forms take over the movie's setting, while the survival colony gets split into two sects. Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) delivers an enthralling performance as the religious fundamentalist who proclaims prophet-hood and grasps this small town group's imagination, turning them into primeval humanoids thirsty for survival on one hand, and on the other, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads a small but rather logistically superior group who eventually take matters into their own hands and decide to gamble matters and explore the unknown.<br/><br/>The Mist's ability to make its audience ask themselves ethical questions as the movie progresses renders it a horror classic. One of the lines that struck me in the movie was when David said that people think they are safe so long as they have 911 and phones, but put them in a disaster setting for ten minutes and their survival instincts kick in. Such was the deep issues of morality and philosophy that this motion picture went into. The ingenious ending epitomizes this great movie and makes sure Frank Darapont has delivered one of the motion pictures of the year.<br/><br/>The Mist is a movie that delivers on so many levels, while managing to capture the wild imagination of it's viewers. Highly recommended!"

","If you had told me that The Mist would turn out to be not just a great horror film, but a great movie overall, I would have laughed. The trailer for this film was laughable, and it looked like a Sci-Fi network film. But it turned out to be a very powerful film. The plot itself is simple, and I loved that the film knew what it was, and it took all advantage of it. It has really well done suspense, and it has great action scenes. But it also has some morality and religious themes that shine through. The performances were all great, for the most part. Thomas Jane is effective as David, as is Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden. But to me the most effective performance was Marcia Gay Harden. She commands the screen as Ms. Carmody, a very religious and very obsessed woman. I think her performance really is a wonder, even award worthy I must say. The direction actually started a little bit off for me. I did not like the 'real' feeling to it, nor the camera-work. But as the film went along, I really came to appreciate it and love it. It really worked. The lack of music I also very much appreciated. I really got into the suspense and the action, thanks to the lack of music, which really had an impact on the scenes. The writing also started off a little bit weak, but I came to realize thanks to the smart script we were given a sort of simple, yet truly remarkable story, but there was some lines here and there that were bad, but some that were really great and well-written.<br/><br/>Now we come to the extremely powerful ending. I had heard a lot about the ending of this film, and I thought it would have something to do with the creatures or the story behind how the mist got there. But I was entirely wrong. It turned out to be a very realistic, a very humane ending. Like I said before, the film already had a lot of religious aspects about humanity and human ways. There was even a certain scene involving the sacrifice of a soldier lead by Ms. Carmody (which I thought was one of the strongest scenes in the film). I thought the ending really was so sad, a true shock. It also marks everything that was wrong with most people. The people in the car, who actually wanted to fight for their lives and had courage enough to go out and try to flee, were the ones that got screwed in the end, while the cowards who stood in the store, just refusing to learn the truth, were the ones who got to survive, is a real downer. But I think the ending works in a lot of different ways, and gives the film a bit more of balance.<br/><br/>Overall though, I was very, very happy with The Mist. I think it is one of Stephen King's best adapted novels-to-films. I also am sure this will become a horror movie classic."

","Stephen King has amazing stories that can be excellent explored or can become a mess, unfortunately most of them become a mess when movie adapted, but for the happiness of some of his fans or for some of those ones that just enjoy a great tale, this is one of those few exceptions. Seems that Frank Darabont is the only director/writer to really understand Stephen King. He did 2 other great adaptations: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999), both critically acclaimed and awarded. He should think about it more often, because it's hard to find great directors and writers to make excellent movies based on Stephen King's novels as Darabont does. From the last couple years 1408 and The Mist are the best adaptations that can be seen.<br/><br/>Like Dreamcatcher, this one's also about strange creatures, but dislike the other one, it has been splendid adapted, becoming a completely terrifying piece of horror. It has monsters, gore, explicit violence but also great dialogs, excellent performances, an effective direction, religious and political issues and an ending completely out of Hollywood proportions.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody is just an excellent example of a breathtaking performance. Thomas Jane as David Draton sometimes seems not so desperate as he should, in fact, a forgettable performance within so many characters well performed. I see some people complaining about the visual effects, yeah, they are not so convincing some times but this is just a detail when compared to other magnificent qualities seen and felt for over 2 hours.<br/><br/>This movie can be loved for the genre lovers and also for those ones who enjoy great subjects for later discussion, but it will probably not be pleasant for people with problems affecting some of their believes or for those ones who are expecting something easy and superficial. There are a lot more within its story than its shown and it doesn't need so much effort to understand some of them at the very beginning.<br/><br/>It's claustrophobic, frightening, shocking. This is not a zombie movie but some references to classic movies as Dawn Of The Dead seems necessary much for its problematic tones disguised thru entire movie, issues that involves social relationships and the constant difficulty of understanding that the modern society presents heavily thru the years, becoming a nightmare when not dealt with logic.<br/><br/>This movie is insane. Interesting and clever insane!"
"scootiepm26","3","1","4","18 November 2008"," Disappointed In The Ending
","I just saw this movie for the first time and thought the ending was a let down. I didn't dislike it because it was shocking. I'm a fan of shock endings. I like surprises. I don't want movie endings to be all fluffy and happy. What I didn't like about the ending of this movie was that it didn't make any sense with what had gone on previously in the film. It seemed created purely to shock people.<br/><br/>It wasn't their only option.<br/><br/>They must have driven past dozens of gas stations where they could have got more fuel, supermarkets etc where they could have got supplies or hotels where they could have got shelter. There was a risk of the monsters attacking sure but they made it to the car so there was a good shot they'd have made it inside a gas station/hotel/supermarket.<br/><br/>Driving around until the gas ran out was pointless. There was no point in leaving the supermarket if that had been their intention. They'd have been better of being sheltered there and shutting up Mrs Carmody than embarking on the stupid thing they did. Waste of time getting into the car in the first place.<br/><br/>I can't understand David shooting his son. That makes no sense to me. It goes against everything a parent and David tried to do for the rest of the film. I have no children but this jarred with me. He spent the whole movie protecting his son especially from Mrs Carmody then puts a bullet in his brain. Uh-huh. If I had a child I'd shoot myself before harming a hair on their head. I just can't buy or accept a parent doing this unless they're not right in the head.<br/><br/>I thought it was really pathetic that seconds after David killed everyone the army magically turn up with their big trucks and the mist disappears. What a load of rubbish. Why didn't they hear the trucks? No matter how scared they were a truck would sound nothing like the monsters. Why didn't they notice the mist fading? Maybe they were blind as well as stupid.<br/><br/>I felt the ending was purposefully created to shock people. It had no connection to the rest of the movie. It made fun of the two hours leading up to it.<br/><br/>I like shock endings when they are logical or at least understandable. This was neither. I'm a huge fan of Stephen King and usually like movie adaptations but this made me feel insulted. I expected better. I won't watch it again. Total let down.<br/><br/>Now, I would have been happy with the whole shooting thing if we had been shown there was no hope or other option. If they couldn't have got gas/food or shelter anywhere else. If the army hadn't turned up. I just felt like the director was making faces at me. Not amusing. Shame on Frank Darabont who's done a good good with other King adaptations."

","Am I going mad here? I have read some of the other comments where this movie is in fact praised as one of the greats. How is that even possible? I saw this movie in theaters and in fact walked out for about 10 minutes because I couldn't stand to see anymore. It was painful to watch and not in the way a horror movie should. Unfortunately I did go back in to watch the most predictable ending I have ever seen. My friends and I in fact said what was going to happen minutes before it came upon screen. (although I do have to say well done on the hopelessness of it.) I know it wasn't just us because the rest of the theater was laughing just as hard as we were in how horrible the movie was. It was boring, predictable, and utterly annoying to watch as the religious shrew kept screeching about judgment day. Although I do have to say the acting was well done. Marcia Gay Harden portrays the bible loving beast so well that everyone literally was shouting for her to get killed. That always shows a great performance. Other than the performances of already great actors, the plot was boring and uninspired and the CGI is laughable. Sorry to ruin it for the fans out there, but even though I haven't read the book, I already know the book was better."
"coldwaterpdh","4","1","4","2 September 2008"," Do all new movies suck this bad ?
","Given the fact that I love Stephen King and own most of his movies on DVD and I also loved Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" (who didn't?) I had to check out this movie ""The Mist."" Boy, was I in for a disappointment.<br/><br/>King's stories are often reputed to have been butchered by screenwriters and directors, but I didn't hear anything like that about this one. Maybe someone should have. I don't think the story translates well to the screen. I think it was a short story, so maybe they could have made a 30 minute TV show about this one because this was a waste of an hour and a half of my life.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a family on a lake and a strange storm that brings with it a strange mist across the lake. The father takes the son into town and the mist comes into town. The rest of the film takes place pretty much in a supermarket, conveniently so the people can survive, and we witness 'human tragedy' and 'barbarism' between the shoppers. They barricade themselves in against these really corny large bugs and what not. In an obvious slam on Christianity, one horrible religious lunatic tries to take over and is killed in a coup de grace for the viewer. I wonder why they didn't make that lady a Muslim? Oh wait...that's not Hollywood! Finally, the American military is bashed because we learn that 'the mist' was an experiment gone array. Whoop dee doo. We've heard that one before.<br/><br/>To cap it all off, the main character is 'forced' to murder his son in the end, then the mist is gone. We never know why, but there is sad music playing and we are supposed to feel compassion but what we really feel is cheated. Cheated out of investment of time, money and emotion.<br/><br/>Like most modern Hollywood duds, this one falls way short. It's ashame because two amazing talents have had their names tarnished. Skip it and see the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" More creative and more powerful on a fraction of the budget.<br/><br/>Gets a bonus star for Thomas Jane though, that guy is too cool for words.<br/><br/>4 out of 10, kids."

After surviving an major storm during the night having with no power and finding some of their property destroyed in their house & as well for their boat house. David, Billy and their neighbor Brent (Andre Braugher) decides to get food in town to the grocery store until the power gets back on. Then an mysterious big mist starts covering the whole town and one of the locals named Dan (Jeffery DeMunn) claims there's something in the mist. While the locals and a few out of towners are frighten to leave the store, if the man is right there's something in the mist waiting for them. Slowly David and his son find themselves an extraordinary odds between the locals, especially people are slowly taking side with an deeply disturbed over-religious woman named Mrs. Carmody (Oscar-Winner:Marcia Gay Harden) starts taking over the store by believing her wild claims. While the creatures in the mist are waiting for them to come out. Now David, his son and other group of people (Laurie Holden, Toby Jones and Frances Sternhagen) will do anything to get out of the store for survival.<br/><br/>Directed by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Majestic, The Shawshank Redemption) made an fascinating, eerie, sometimes old-fashioned Horror film with strong moments of scares, excitement and dark comedy. Darabont is extremely faithful to the novella by Stephen King (1408, Silver Bullet, Stand by Me), which Darabont makes small changes to the novella and the ending as well. Jane offers his best performance in this feature, which Jane appeared in a previous King misguided adaptation ""Dreamcatcher"". The performance in the picture are extremely good here, especially the scene-stealing performances by Harden and Jones. The creatures effects created by Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger (Hostel Part 1 & 2, The Chronciles of Narnia:The Lion-the Witch and the Wardrobe, John Carpenter's Vampires) and Gregory Nicotero (The Hills Have Eyes Part 1 & 2, Stephen King's Desperation, George A. Romero's Land of the Dead) are giving terrific F/X creature work. Which it's one of the highlights of this movie.<br/><br/>The two-disc set of ""The Mist"" is great. First DVD is the original theatrical version, which DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc one includes an running commentary track by the filmmaker, deleted scenes with optional commentary, an featurette about the art of movie posters and webisodes. Second disc has the terrific looking Black & White feature of the movie with introduction by the filmmaker. I think ""The Mist"" looks ever better and creepier in Black & White. Disc two also includes an documentary and three featurettes. ""The Mist"" did so-so business at the box office, when it was first released in the winter of 2007. Some of the top film critics felt ""The Mist"" was something special while others didn't. But die-hard fans of Stephen King's books or films truly loved this movie best. But the feature certainly does have an second life on DVD. Since Darabont previously directed an Stephen King adaptation named ""The Shawshank Redemption"" became an instead classic once it hit Video and Television back in 1995. There was a few strong horror movies that came out in 2007 but ""The Mist"" was certainly one of the best horror film of 2007 with an heartbreaking bleak conclusion. There's an great use of ""The Host of Seraphin"" song by Dead Can Dance. Don't miss it. Darabont also wrote the screenplay and he's one of the producers as well. (****/*****)."
"FredKrueger10","10","1","4","14 July 2008"," One of the bestest horror films I've ever seen.
","The Mist was among one of the last films I saw on DVD. I was intending on seeing it in the cinemas but I didn't have time to see it. However, I shocked with the tension in the film (positive say). I had my hand over my mouth. I was shocked.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: The characters were among the great things in the film. Marcia Gay Harden's performance as the scary Mrs. Carmody was terrifying and comes in second as the most terrifying character in a horror movie besides Annie Wilkies. I was very impressed and I really felt like shooting her myself. SUSPENSE: Well, I would call The Mist, a supernatural horror-thriller. The tension comes in quick and keeps it at a high level throughout the entire film. SPECIAL EFFECTS: I'm not sure if Darabont used CGI or puppetry, he could've used both but the creatures sent tingles up my spine. BEGINNING: The good thing with The Mist is that it gives all the characters, a quick introductions then throwing them into the situation. MIDDLE: Tensions are at a high during the whole course of the film and I was kept getting stomach pains (weird, I know). The gore was at a perfect level. ENDING: This is one of the most shocking twist endings I've ever seen. I walked out of the cinema horrified. Compared to what was seen throughout the film, this was the horror of all of the film. DIRECTOR: Frank Darabont is great. He shows true character emotions with various camera movements and angles. He has some talent. DIALOGUE: With more focus on the action and horror, the dialogue gives it an extra boost. The dialogue is simple and smart.<br/><br/>The Mist is one of the greatest films I've seen. I'm not a fan of horror films but I had the urge to see it and I was amazed. The true marking that gives The Mist an extra kick is because it is quick, it runs two hours, it gives at least 15 minutes introducing the characters and then it is pure suspense until the credits.<br/><br/>The Mist deserves a full... ***** out of *****"
"Sovereign","9","1","4","11 July 2008"," Good King horror. At last.
","I've lost faith in King adaptations. Most of them are so ridiculous I wanna cry. There are however notable exceptions and The Mist is one of them. It's not that the Stephen King overthetopness is not there, it is the character development that makes this so different, not only to other King horror movies but to most contemporary thriller/horror/sci-fi as well. I don't want to spoil the ending, I would just want to say that comments about happy and sad endings are always so subjective that it becomes ridiculous to judge a movie on whether it has a happy or a nihilistic, miserable one. Is it clever? Does it work? I think these are more relevant questions and in this movie, the end WORKS. One last thing: Interpreting Stephen King has many levels. It's very difficult to show this in a movie, but this one succeeds. 100%."

","Much of this is typical King fare... improbable dialogue, and evil or danger manifested in almost ridiculous forms. It would be better had we seen nothing of the ""beasts in the mist""--that might create a genuinely psychological thriller. As it is, this is a monster story, almost from start to end (I came to this, having just watched ""Cloverfield"", and thought, ""What the hell--another monster movie??"").<br/><br/>But nothing prepares you for the ending. This, above all the prior formulaic triteness, was memorable. I literally sat for half and hour, not knowing how to react. My wife was going to watch it the next day, but I wanted to say, ""No, trust me, you won't want to see this."" I just found it deeply disturbing and confronting. Interesting that an earlier commenter found the ending trite and predictable--I certainly didn't predict it.<br/><br/>Gotta see this."

","I had managed to miss all the trailers and publicity for this film until a colleague mentioned it to me yesterday morning. I was straight out that very evening to see it.<br/><br/>I read the novella about 20 years earlier, as part of the book ""Skeleton Crew"", which was one of the best parts of that book. All I could remember from it was something about spiders and slicing web-strands and an immense hoofed thing. To my delight, all of these appeared on the big screen and the story seemed to be close to the original too.<br/><br/>The army being the cause of it all spoiled it somewhat but the explanation of how they caused it was quite good I thought. Overall, it would have arguably been better to retain the purity of King's story. The ending was a disappointment; for once being actually too nasty for my liking. Whilst not as gut-wrenching, King's ending was more chilling.<br/><br/>Average fx (I'm very anti-cgi) were made up for by great performances. This is where we notice the quality of a solid director like Darabont. I'm not in the ""shawshank is #1"" camp but Frank is very competent. Thank heaven a team with the ""Blockbuster"" mentality didn't pick this one up, else we'd have had one-liners all the way through like ""now that's what I call a close encounter"" or ""he had to split"", alongside vest-wearing women with rocket launchers ""kicking-ass"" and doing kung foo. I get cold sweats thinking about it.<br/><br/>Best film I've seen in a while and probably one of the best horror films this decade. The religious nut is the star of the show.

"joecunningham14","7","1","4","7 July 2008"," 'THE MIST' REVIEW FROM deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com
","VISIT deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com FOR MORE REVIEWS It has taken eight months for 'The Mist' to descend onto British cinema screens since it debuted in America last November, and has already made it onto DVD stateside. So why have we been made to wait so long? Well it's fair to say that the US audience didn't really take to Frank Darabont's latest Stephen King adaptation, grossing only $25million, our friends across the pond struggling with it's downbeat ending. The final scene is, well, it's not the cheeriest...in fact it may be one of the most heartbreaking, depressing and downright bleakest endings to a film in recent years. But don't let that put you off, after all, this is a horror movie, you wouldn't expect it to leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.<br/><br/>Darabont's previous takes on King novels have included 'The Green Mile' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', not a bad track record. He saturated both of those pieces with an overriding sense of hope, 'The Mist' chews up that hope and spits back a cocktail of pessimism and despair. The film follows David Drayton (Thomas Jayne) and his young son Billy (Nathan Gamble) who are trapped in a local supermarket alongside members of their small-town community, when the titular mist surrounds the store. All matter of horrible creatures, great and small, begin to emerge from the mist in true B-movie style, the threat of the monsters becoming more real and more terrifying with each confrontation.<br/><br/>Trapped, afraid and confused, the shoppers wander towards 'Lord of the Flies' territory as human nature's less favourable aspects come to the fore and we are forced to ask ourselves: Is the greater danger posed by the beasts outside, or the beasts within? Granted this is not the first time that this avenue has been explored, but when done as well as it is here, it rarely fails to raise many important issues and questions about the darker side of the human condition. This is personified by the deeply religious Mrs Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), her fundamentalist beliefs and crazed rants slowly but surely gain her supporters amongst the wayward flock of shoppers. At times you may question such a deranged character but Harden's portrayal is fantastically intense nonetheless.<br/><br/>Such patent digs at organised religion however and exceptionally thinly-veiled digs at the Bush administration that are peppered throughout the script are shortcomings that needlessly divert attention away from a gripping horror story that otherwise rarely relents in pace and terror. There seems little need for such subtext and the lack of subtlety in it's deliverance at times grows thoroughly exasperating. Apart from that the film excels and you can barely believe that it was received so badly by the US public. Sorry America, but you got it badly wrong on this occasion. The final five minutes are worth the extra eight-month wait alone, let's hope that we can show it the appreciation that it deserves.<br/><br/>Verdict: A fantastic example of mainstream horror on a smaller budget and the latest on the ever-growing list of successful Stephen King big-screen adaptations."
"kosmasp","8","1","4","6 July 2008"," Clear Vision
","Frank Darabont of ""Shawshank"" fame has made yet another Stephen King film/movie adaptation. More Horror than Drama this time around, you might be excused of having doubts about the cast. Thomas Jane in particular, better known for his action roles (Punisher). Can he carry this movie? <br/><br/>My answer is yes. Of course he has many good actors that support him, but he's the main guy and the movie would have fallen, if he wouldn't have been up for the task. There are some bumpy moments (cliché bordering at times), but the actors make them work alright.<br/><br/>Depending on if you read the book (I haven't), or read the plot line/saw the trailer, you have already gathered informations about the movie. I went in without knowing anything, other than it sounded a bit like an unofficial FOG (Carpenter) Remake. Let me tell you that apart from the FOG part, it has nothing in common with that movie! Chilly and character driven it is and it has an ending that might leave some people crying and other cheering (not literally though I guess) ... I liked it"
"come2whereimfrom","7","1","4","2 July 2008"," Its a Mist-ery
","Comparisons to John Carpenter's The Fog are inevitable when dealing with any spooky weather condition the difference is in the fact that this film was made in a world post 911. Because even though we know its monsters it is always hinted at that it could be in fact a terrorist attack, but its not I assure you, it's something much worse. The trouble with horror films is there are just so many of them and not a week goes by that your local cinema isn't showing a group of bikini clad teenagers in constant peril. The difference with The Mist is that it isn't beautiful collage graduates on a jaunt that are in trouble here its ordinary everyday folk like you and me. Its really young kids and old folks and dads and shop keepers all thrust together in very powerful and frightening situation and just like that fateful New York day they are going to have to work together to survive. Based on the writing of Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont 'The Mist' rolls in and with it quite nasty lovecraftian gribblies that by chance or not do look incredibly similar to those of another big hit film set in New York. The cast of relatively unknowns here do a great job of steering the films action and pace, the CGI is good and the ending will blow your mind. The Mist bases a great deal of its horror on suspense and the unknown like Blair Witch or The Orphanage before it and it is a throw back to the horror of the 1950 end of the world scenarios (so much so that the American DVD release contains a black and white version of the film). Packed with tension, jumps and scares it's a must see movie, oh and did I mention the amazing ending?"
"Hugh Sullivan","3","1","4","31 May 2008"," Changing the ending
","Most of the time Stephen King doesn't seem to know how to end his books. It's as if he writes and writes and then gets tired of it. I think the novellas and short stories often make better movies. I was surprised how well the book ended, and so I was disappointed with the movie. I am not a purist. I prefer the movie of The Shining by Kubrick to the book, and they are very different animals.<br/><br/>The nice thing about the ending in the book is that things were open-ended. There's a balance between the stupidity of the people (the ignorant and the willful ignorant) and the stupidity of our government scientists who have created the mess in the first place.<br/><br/>What the screenwriters did was to show the government fighting back and winning the war on terror. Who is punished in the end? Those stupid people who weren't patient for the government to save us. Subtext, anyone?"
"asharples","7","1","4","29 May 2008"," There IS something in the mist... a great Adaptation
","I read about this movie release a while ago back in early 2007 and anticipated the UK cinema release. Now, either I missed it, was asleep or got taken to another planet, I don't ever recall seeing this released at the local multiplex. In fact I don't remember seeing it released anywhere at all. So, time passes by and a friend of mine lets me know that ""The Mist"" is available on Region 1 DVD. So, being a Darabont fan I jumped at the chance to buy it.<br/><br/>Firstly I have to say that this is probably one of the better screenplay adaptations of a Stephen King story. The Characters are nicely developed and even though you are not party to the background of each one, you still feel like you know them. Perhaps because they resemble people you already know or have met. The strength of ""The mist"" comes from the way things are revealed. Bit by bit. You almost feel as if you are a third person, trapped with all of them in the convenience store. You want to know more about the mist and when you do you just end up salivating for the next morsel.<br/><br/>Secondly Frank's interpretation of the short story is very well done. The camera-work is awesome, using a hand-held technique similar to 24. All in all this was a good 2 hours spent in-front of the TV. <br/><br/>Like most of the comments on here I have to say that the ending left me with a horrid empty feeling. I felt there was no real closure to the story and part of me wanted to see what was going to happen next. Alas this will never be.<br/><br/>Good movie. Now I wonder if the Dark Tower will ever get made? :D"
"EllenRipley112","9","1","4","24 May 2008"," King fans need not fear
","One of the hardest things Hollywood tries do to is take excellent stories and/or books and bring them to the silver screen, and in my experience, it seems they have the hardest time with the works of Stephen King. The readers want to see the story played out before them just like they envisioned it when they read the story, but that experience is different for everyone--what matters most is if the story plays out as the author envisioned it, and from what I've read, Mr. King gave this his seal of approval, which is the main reason I wanted to see it. And I'm so glad I did. So many of Hollywood's versions of King's works have missed the mark, because he put so much depth into each of his characters, no matter how minor they may be, and each subplot has so much detail, there's no way one of his full-length novels can be properly condensed into a 90-minute movie--the best one can hope for is a mini-series on HBO or Showtime. When it comes to his short stories, however, it seems that sometimes even 90 minutes isn't enough to encompass the full scope if the story King wants to tell us. This movie has fully grasped the finer points of the story and properly sifted the wheat from the chaff, keeping the best parts and retaining the meat of the story. And the ending--OH. MY. I can see Mr. King hearing someone reading it to him and going, ""THAT'S how I should have ended it!"" while smacking himself in the head. I love a movie that kicks my butt, and this one did--royally."
"dispositioning","3","1","4","22 May 2008"," The screenplay.
","I had watched The Mist based on a recommendation and was left shocked.<br/><br/>Not by the ending, not by the scary monsters or the acting, but by the screenplay.<br/><br/>Surely real people would not respond in such ways as was depicted in this film.<br/><br/>**Contains spoilers** Where an obviously large creature, not familiar with the workings of a garage roller door tries to force his/her way inside, the stunned hero of the movie who witnesses this lets others (that weren't there) know that he'd 'heard a noise'.<br/><br/>Consequently, somebody dies thinking it's OK to go outside. Now, that just seemed so silly it was pretty much a plot hole. <br/><br/>But mostly it was the time line that ruined this for me. Too much happened too fast. People just aren't that stupid that quickly.<br/><br/>Sure if people were confronted with the events of this movie over a much longer period of time - like a month - then I wouldn't question how most in a supermarket might turn to an evangelist for answers - but not in two days, not when there is plenty of food to mellow folks out. I mean, what benefit was there to be had in killing a woman and her child . . .<br/><br/>And what was with all the black people in the supermarket not believing the white - though all they had to do was go into the next room and see the remains of an alien - and then consequently wandering off into the mist to die? I don't look to the next whitey to find out what to do next. Or do the opposite of the black guy next to me. I'm still cringing about that. <br/><br/>You generally don't even make it to the supermarket if you can't think for yourself.<br/><br/>And the ending. I'm a Dad. I wouldn't put a cap in my son, it's just not what we are programmed to do (most of us). But I could have accepted this ending, but then of course - the mist cleared in seconds to reveal the heroes folly. <br/><br/>I laughed. Obviously some that watched this movie were actually 'shocked' reading the reviews. However the films reviews have been the most shocking. Folks - 7.5/10? <br/><br/>And the scene where this large monster comes out the mist - grabs a guy - rips him apart - and then walks away to the amazement of onlookers. What about the onlookers? How about maybe KILL THEM TOO!!! What was the purpose of your cameo? To prove you're random? Random makes poor horror.<br/><br/>Now I've had a chat to my mate who recommended this film and he continues to see something in this that I don't. There is some social commentary that is enlightening for him - like the people in the supermarket were more scary than the monsters outside - but for me the regurgitated stereotypes, the stupidity and the unrealistic time line ruined this film. <br/><br/>Could have been much, much better."
"ExpendableMan","8","1","4","17 May 2008"," Oh my god! They killed the Shermanator!
","Before getting into the meat of this review, I'd like to say this: if you're a horror fan and want to experience The Mist to its full potential, stop reading and go see it now. This is an excellent film, the kind of tense, masterful horror you rarely get nowadays but the more you know about it, the less of an impact it will have. I went into this movie blind expecting the latest PG-13 horror sensation but by the time the end credits rolled all the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. Its a creepy, atmospheric little shocker that'll hopefully become one of the sleeper hits of the year but honestly, the less you know, the better it will be.<br/><br/>Still here? Well, don't say I didn't warn you.<br/><br/>Playing on the idea that to create hell you simply need to put a small group of people in a confined space with no hope of escape, The Mist is a deliciously twisted horror gem that writhes with a nastiness not seen since John Carpenter's heyday. From its deceptively low-key start which sees Thomas Jane taking his son to a convenience store, things soon start to escalate and before long, an ordinary day has turned into a nightmarish experience that doesn't let up for one tense, claustrophobic minute. What makes it truly unsettling is the fact that despite the...things that are walking around outside hidden by the mist, the real menace can be found inside the grocery store. This is a story of humanity under pressure and how ranting insanity can seem perfectly rational when you're cut off from all hope of survival. All it takes for humanity to destroy itself is for no one to answer when you dial 911.<br/><br/>Central to this cloying atmosphere of nerves and fear is the cinematography. The film is largely shot in close up and as a consequence, it feels a lot like you're listening in on all the huddled, whispered conversations the characters have. In addition, it means that you don't always get a good look at the wealth of monsters prowling outside, giving them a mysterious and otherworldly air that wouldn't have been possible if the film was better lit.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the actors at work here perfectly capture their roles. These are not cut and paste Hollywood stars that are likely to appear in gossip magazines gushing about their new diets, they look, act and feel like ordinary small town folk put in an impossible situation. Even Thomas Jane feels like a mundane, beer-drinking Joe. His performance is one of the film's best, a subtle and carefully nuanced portrayal of a father trying to keep his promises to his son while society collapses all around him, but he does have the unfortunate position of having every scene stolen from under him by Marcia Gay Harden's psychotic Christian bitch-Queen. She is not one of those positive Christians who don't mind if you decide to sleep in every Sunday, she's a deranged lunatic who believes that God is a blood thirsty, vengeful monster. When she takes it upon herself to 'save' the inhabitants of the grocery store things take a very unpleasant turn and every time she escapes death you'll be punching the air in frustration.<br/><br/>Amid all the violence, monsters, tension and chaos however, The Mist is still a very human story. It's a testament to the screen writing talents of Frank Darabont and Steven King that Harden aside, you don't want any of these people to die and when they inevitably do (in a multitude of messy, sticky ways), it's all the more devastating. Strangely enough though, the most traumatic moment isn't a character's death but his survival, sometimes saving the world is worse than its destruction. Excellent film, if you're prepared to put up with nightmares for weeks you can't really afford to miss it."

","This movie was a joke and required Tylenol as a remedy. A person with half a brain knows that flying bugs are attracted to light, and when the bugs are as huge as depicted in the movie, its advisable not to mess around with them much less be a hero around them. Even if most sci-fi horror/thriller movies do not pay much attention to science, there are some that are plausible (Species, Alien) and made with some thought and consideration for science. This one throws science and common sense in the dungeon. The revolt is ridiculous and the end makes no sense. The preacher woman in the movie is just annoying. I gave this movie a rating of 2 because it shows a side of radical religion views and its consequences. Stephan King must have written this hastily because I did not expect a novel/movie this bad from him."

I especially enjoyed the fact that this movie didn't cop out and play things safe in a few scenes. One scene had actually got me to cheer out loud in my own living room and clap my hands.

"iridescent_dove","3","1","4","31 March 2008"," Really Dumb
","The movie itself was well made and suspenseful. You wanted to know what was going to happen. This is the only reason I (generously) gave this movie a 3. The problem with the movie is that the whole point of the first 5/6ths of the movie was that Christians are terrible people. Particularly Conservative-leaning Christians (total lunatics!). And the last 6th of the movie was even worse. I won't tell you how it ends, but it was a horrible ending. A total waste of time. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. My comment has to be 10 lines long so I will go ahead and give a quick outline of the movie. After a major storm, the lead character, David, takes his little boy to the local grocery store to pick up some groceries to get them through until their power comes back on. While they are in the store, a mist settles over the area. If anyone goes outside, the people within the building hear their agonizing death screams, and occasionally find body parts etc... Well, as all the people are in the building, scared of what's outside, the crazy Christian lady, Mrs. Carmody, stirs up the frightened people until they become a foaming, frothing, rabid (Christian) mob. Anyone who disagrees with them, or that they think had something to do with causing the mist outside gets murdered or sacrificed to the monsters outside. Finally a group of people make it outside, some of them make it to David's car, and they try to drive out of the mist... The ending is worse than the scene inside the store. Unless you want to be talked down to, insulted, and then depressed, don't rent this movie, don't watch this movie, don't buy this movie. Do something more useful with your time, like lace and re-lace your shoelaces 72 times."

","Its pretty hard to butcher a Steven king story, but apparently someone found a way to do it. First of all, there is no suspense since they show the creature with the tentacles in the first 30 minutes of the movie, so you know what the thing looks like. Second of all there was never a real sense of horror since you basically know what the people are going up against, hell, they even tell you when they're going somewhere dangerous, nothing ever jumps out at you or scares you, which in my opinion is a key element in a horror film. And lastly, they linked this movie to some military mishap, but they never tell you exactly what happens, it was just awful how they planned it. What disappointed me was that this film could have been good if it had just had some suspense to it, and some decent acting. The end was the only reason that i gave this thing 2 stars, it was not a terrible ending, but the first 1 hour and 55 minutes is not worth the ending.

"shelbyc_72","9","1","4","30 March 2008"," Great Horror Flick - May Contain Spoiler
","This compelling, fast-paced story is full of believable characters -- which is, of course, the important thing. Who cares about the circumstances if the characters are poorly crafted? It manages to create a good amount of suspense with a VERY creepy (a la Alien) environment. The movie might affect you negatively if like eating shellfish or squid, or are arachnophobic -- but apart from that, it's good clean fun. Most stunning, perhaps, is that it is still possible to be shocked at how twisted Stephen King's mind is -- especially when you get a load of the ending. You kind of sense the absolute futility of the hero's last determination before it happens, but that doesn't stop the effect of his last act from hitting like a ton of bricks. This was a full-on screamer to watch, and great for a solid sense of relief and release after a week of work staring into a computer screen crafting careful sentences. Great performances by all the actors, too - a real ID with the reactions to the Marcia Gay Harden character.<br/><br/>The only sore/sour note is the clumsy attempt at creating a racist-oriented humor directed toward the Andre Braugher character. When Drayton et al can't convince him to stay inside because giant squid-monsters dragged Norm outside and ate him, they try to entice him to stay by offering him barbecued chicken. It wasn't funny and it was in poor taste. Also the script has Braugher calling the white guys ""hicks!"" at the top of his lungs, which seemed off. It just didn't work. A minor part of the movie, but seemed weird and awkward. Better to leave race alone if you're not going to be clear about it."

","One of my most favorite King stories, not done much justice. This a surprise with Darabont as director. In a nutshell, not scary, poorly acted, an a big stray from King's short story. The best acting was done by character Drayton's son. Although I wish opposite, Jane's acting was pretty bad in this flick (forced), along with most others. There just seemed not a enthusiastic effort by all involved. I mean the initial storm, in King's story, and a fairly decent audio play circa 1985, was HUGE, and certainly set the tone of the story.

It looked and felt like a low budget film. I love low budget movies don't get me wrong, but when I go see a mainstream studio film I expect to get my 10 dollars worth. At least with low budget, no name, direct to video, you get boobs or better yet nubile naked males cavorting around. I thought about walking out 15 minutes before it ended, and I wish I had but I held out for that hail Mary play at the end. You know the scene that would make it all worth it? It never happened.

"JWJanneck","9","1","4","11 March 2008"," Horror for grown-ups: monsters + Lord of the Flies + On the Beach + Alien +, yeah, The Fog
","In a nutshell: One of the best horror flicks I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Not knowing the book, and being generally only medium-impressed with Mr King's oeuvre, I started watching this without great expectations. A Fog rip-off with monsters is what I thought. Which is, at some level, what this is---a mist moves into town, brings a bunch of rather nasty creatures with it (very well done creatures, by the way), people get killed.<br/><br/>But it is so much more. For one thing, in spite of how well done and terrible the creatures were, and in spite of the body count they racked up while going about their business being movie monsters, the true horror depicted in this movie, the one that sticks with you after the credits roll, has only tangentially to do with them, and in fact those creatures are nowhere near when it happens. At its core, this movie is not really about them, they are a plot device, almost a MacGuffin---to experiment with the question: How do you isolate and scare the living daylights out of your ordinary supermarket crowd, and what happens if you do? In themselves, the Mist Creatures do, of course, provide some good (and usually gory) entertainment. But then they trigger the Lord of the Flies/On the Beach storyline, and that is where this movie rises above the slasher/gore-fest genre. For one thing, it provides opportunity for some incredible acting, most notably by Harden, Sadler, and Braugher (in that order). Harden in particular shows another facet of her ample acting talent, in a performance that could easily among her best work so far---no small praise. Sadler probably has the part that has the broadest range, and he delivers the goods. The performance of the leading man is solid, too, but his character gives Jane a lot less to work with.<br/><br/>The expose explaining the creatures is flimsy, quickly dealt with, and remains mostly irrelevant. That seems to be good judgment on the part of the filmmakers---focusing on the people at the expense of monster-effects makes the experience much more real, and it provides room for some plot that lesser horror movies would have invested in graphic violence and complicated exposes on the adversary. These monsters here come (SPOILER, if you want to call it that) somehow from another dimension, the military of course had to do with it, and that was that---who cares. The important things are happening in that supermarket away from giant spiders from another dimension.<br/><br/>No matter how well done the creatures are, it is the story of that grocery store crowd that will stick with you after the movie is over, it is that story that makes this movie a must-see."

They are against the senseless lack of worth of life brought forward by the religious extremists, and yet they decide to end it like that. That was the worst ending on a movie I've ever seen.

","I thought this movie was pretty good, although it could have been trimmed some without any loss and gained some momentum I didn't know about the ending so it came as a surprise. I think the ending makes the movie a lot more subversive than the typical movie in this genre When you think about on it, the main character, the ""everyman"" with whom we automatically identify, made one bad decision after the other and yet we keep rooting for him because thats what we're conditioned to do And his last decision was the most ill considered of all The whole story would fall apart if somewhere in the store where all of the characters were trapped someone had had a cell phone, or there had been a functioning radio or TV. In that sense the ending is somewhat of a cheat. I won't comment on the Marcia Gaye Harden character, although I thought her performance was very good Buy my opinion would probably make someone mad."

","If The Mist is set out to be a serious horror movie, it fails miserably. There are so many inconsistencies, and general failure on the part of the characters, that it is funny. I couldn't help myself. I laughed throughout nearly the whole movie. Granted, a LOT of it is very dark humor, but there are simply far too many occasions where, if only the characters had THOUGHT about what they were doing, or maybe considered other options for a split second... they would have avoided a great deal of grief. You might have to be a little twisted to laugh as much as I did, hell maybe even very twisted. Personally, I got the sense that the only reason bad things kept happening to these characters is that they took absolutely NO steps to avert the situation, and usually ended up making the poorest choice the situation required. Makes for a funny movie in the end, I thought. A lot of people will find the ending devastating, but I say again... if only the characters had considered, other, more rational choices... or even paused to deliberate over their state, a lot of unhappiness could have been averted.<br/><br/>If they marketed this as a comedy/thriller, I would give it a 8.5, but they didn't, and it comes off as a VERY poor movie if taken seriously.

"JaydoDre","6","1","4","8 December 2007"," Lot's of mist but no fire...
","Let's get something straight first: The Mist is supposed to be a horror movie. Horror movies are supposed to keep you thrilled. With that in mind, I believe the makers of The Mist didn't do a splendid job, as this movie wastes way too much precious filming tape on all the wrong things.<br/><br/>The storyline is not complicated. We're introduced into a small town that is being swallowed in thick mist after a storm the night before. People who get exposed to the outside get killed by strange life forms, and in these circumstances a group of people is locked inside a convenience store puzzled as to what they should do next.<br/><br/>It takes forever before the real action starts, about a half of the movie in fact. On its own this fact isn't necessarily a mood killer. A long and scary run up can be a good thing, but the first 50 minutes of this long (app 2 hours) movie you will spend on listening to the somewhat empty chat between the different characters. <br/><br/>Here's another problem that is within a problem. Conversation can be interesting even if lasts 50 minutes, but the conversation in The Mist isn't going anywhere. It consists out of cheesy and rather stupid dialogue. The actors do a fine job, but the script fails them. Much of the attention is given to a psychotic religious woman who keeps saying the same thing about the doomsday over and over. At some point what the characters say and do starts to irritate. After watching this movie one might get an impression that the majority of humans are complete morons with a single digit IQ, primitive superstitions, no will power and no logic. Of course that's true to some degree (definately in a horror movie), but the movie basically makes fun out of people and religion.<br/><br/>The Mist is mostly about the interactions between the survivors. The mysterious disaster at hand is given very little attention, which I should admit is quite realistic. The main characters do not try to solve the epic problem that they do not understand, and are instead concerned with their own safe being only. There are quite a few surprises in the plot, including a very unconventional ending. The movie keeps enforcing a very depressive mood.<br/><br/>The action itself is pretty interesting. Good special effects and design give the ""bad guys"" a very distinct look. Interaction with the non-virtual world is realistic. The camera work is solid. The idea of a thick mist is a nice one, as the mist substitutes for the night time and the unknown in general.<br/><br/>The Verdict<br/><br/>If you get through the first half of the movie without falling a sleep, you will be up for a cool encounter. The stupidity doesn't however stop once the action starts. This still is an interesting flick to see."
"Rahnisings","6","1","4","8 December 2007"," A Look at Human Behavior
","I found the movie impetuous to the belief that one black man's opinion of the situation at hand would result in the death of all the African American people in the supermarket except for one who took his own life and one who was killed due to his part in the experiment that led to this unfortunate disaster. This movie truly is a psychological drama based upon the ""what if"" scenario of human behavior gone wrong in a time of contention. I suppose I was looking beyond the monsters in the mist to the deep seated meaning of what the writer and director was trying to depict of human nature. The slaying of the religious zealot, though apropos at the time due to her overzealous actions, also showed how most people feel about religion in general; and the fact that the bible states that suicide is a sin, we see suicide throughout the movie even up to the end, where are ""hero"" found that if he had indeed waited, all would have been well. Other than that, the movie was authentic to the original story in the book"
"ven2s","6","1","4","8 December 2007"," Great effects, so so acting
","Many will like this movie for its special effects and shear scare factor. But acting by Thomas Jane was questionable. Good at points, in his more crucial scenes, where he has to really emote deep grief, he tries but ends up straining at the bit. In fact he tries so hard that it comes off too strained. Marcia Gay Harden does a convincing role as a crazy religious fanatic, so good that you will end up hating her character. The little boy and the majority of the other actors do a great job, but where the rubber meets the road, on Thomas Jane's broad shoulders, it melts and flops. He is convincing for the strong parts but his deeper emotional value is not there, and this is crucial for the impact of the movie; especially at the end. Although you will probably get shaking by the effects and the out of the box thinking of the movie."
"nefertari86","7","1","4","2 December 2007"," Great movie
","A lot of people seem to be comparing this to The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption, but a better comparison is to Lord of the Files. The difference The Mist, though, is that the beasties are real.<br/><br/>Residents of a small Maine community (the usual Stephen King setting) are trapped in a grocery store by a mysterious mist which hides mysterious monsters. Along with the battle against the monsters, the characters battle each other and their own natures in a good illustration of the primal side of humanity and what happens when society devolves.<br/><br/>There is also a realistic illustration of how in times of crisis there are acts of amazing compassion and bravery, but also ones of cruelty and self preserving. The protagonists are the group who remain rational for as long as possible, and the antagonists a group who fall into the group hysteria stirred up by a religious zealot played by Marcia Gay Harden. Some have said she overacted the role, but I think she pulled it off brilliantly in that she achieved what she should when playing an antagonist....she got everyone to hate her. I live right smack in the middle of the Bible belt in a community where several real Mrs. Carmodys live, but when Harden's character was finally killed I wasn't the first to applaud! SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING The ending was horrifying, gut wrenching, and I absolutely loved it! Searching for a moral in it probably isn't the best idea. It's better to look at it as just a dramatic tragedy. It seems so pointless, but you realize that it really couldn't have been avoided without the 20/20 vision that hindsight allows."
"dantheman0056","8","1","4","28 November 2007"," A Horror movie that moves away from Torture
","After seeing the trailers for this movie I thought it looked interesting so I went to see it with a couple of friends. I was quite pleased with it as the horror was not about torture and porn but a spooky atmosphere with horrifying events. Basically an odd mist rolls in and many of the towns people are stranded in a supermarket only to discover that there's something dangerous in the mist and they hate humans. The characters are well cast and the setting and effects are great. One of thee scariest things about this movie is what people will turn to when all hope seems lost. The religious zealot has just about everyone turned to her because they believe she will guide them to safety. (Spoilers: she was wrong). All though there is gore it isn't about some guy taking a device and slowly ripping them apart like some modern day movies.<br/><br/>Now this is where things go a bit downhill. So far this review has been pretty positive but there are 2 major complaints that I have. First is that the main characters the good and bad tended to do really stupid things. For example without giving too much away : A couple of people are running from the creatures hiding in a car. When they get in they stay there. No literally stay in the parked car for a bout a minute before driving away. The 2nd and major thing is the ending. It was possible the worst ending I have ever seen. I will leave it at that because I don't want to ruin it(I know I was kind of anti-climatic) but you really just have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Ending aside this was a good horror movie."

","Don't get me wrong, this is a good stephen king adaptation, and a good film, but the ending of this film was unnecessarily tragic, as opposed to the original king ending which seems somewhat optimistic and hopeful. all in all a solid horror film with copious amounts of gore, bloodshed, and suspense. it's beyond me why directors tamper with king's stories (the ending to this film deviates from the original almost as much as kubrick's butchered ending to the shining), and while this revamped ending is still satisfactory, something should be said for keeping stephen king's original vision intact when translating his storytelling to the screen."
"jdesando","Null","1","4","27 November 2007"," A refreshing blast.
","Stephen King can be downright scary but with a social sensibilityCarrie and 1408 come immediately to mind. So The Mist is a refreshing blast of King at his best, mixing horror with commentary on absurd, complex, and doomed humanity. The film depicts in Maine a fog rolling in with creatures that eat humans alive and generally cause panic and mayhem of the War of the Worlds and Body Snatchers type.<br/><br/>Artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane in good Dennis-Quaid form) is the designated hero for the people trapped in a grocery store while various mist monsters terrorize them. But the over-sized squid and spiders are only director Frank Darabont's visual way of exploring the ambivalence of humans in extreme circumstances.<br/><br/>Although he film wrestles with too many major challenges to humans in extremis, thanks goodness it tries and sometimes succeeds with solid results. For instance, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) pulls a Jim Jones with apocalyptic warning tactics that mobilize most of the people in the market against the small band of good guys. Her rant is mostly about conversing with God, who tells her that they are being punished for their heathen natures, much as Pat Robertson blamed the unwashed for 9/11. The question for the good guys is whether or not to eliminate her, an act antithetical to goodness except in extreme survival mode. The larger issue is the influence of the real right and neocons like Dick Cheney, who have made a life of scaring the bejesus out of the common folk.<br/><br/>King provides other contemporary socio/political topics such as the ambivalent role of the military, at once responsible for the mutants and at another time savior for the suffering people. Throw in the mix the horrors of euthanasia and class conflict, and you have way too much to deal with in a short horror flick. To its credit, the film uses only minimal CGI to create a 50's kind of intellectual horror, where the people inside the grocery store become more like the monsters without as their primal instinct to survive kicks in.<br/><br/>I'm going to Maine next week; I think I'll just sit out the usual fog during unusually balmy fall days. Hey, maybe this overripe allegory is also about global warming!"

Why would David give up hope at a time that didn't even seem to be completely hopeless yet after showing such bravery for the first 80% of the movie? Drivel!! And it was especially disappointing since the rest of the movie was so excellent. I think it shows how bleak our society has become since the original story was written.

The monsters were not at the car getting ready to eat them. Don't do it. You have time. There is no rush.<br/><br/>Shock and reactions: In the storage room I just don't believe they would have done something as rash as that so soon after the whole situation started. These two guys that teacher later mentioned weren't exactly the greatest in school - I just don't think they would be motivated to risk what they attempted with the generator. I suppose I need to read some disaster follow up reports - how did people handle Katrina, earthquakes, 9/11, Titanic, hostage situations, etc. I found it hard to believe some of the conversations would actually happen in this situation.<br/><br/>Military: Come on soldiers I know you are young. I know you felt responsible but you could have stepped up at the beginning.<br/><br/>I really like the creatures and thought the pharmacy scenes were very cool.<br/><br/>Religion: Cut the religion out of this movie and make it a monster movie and the score goes up. In something like 2 days we have a Jim Jones Cult form?? Please show me the studies that demonstrate in a situation where that would develop so quickly. Ollie should have done his work sooner. If they knew this was coming (cult) TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM.<br/><br/>Maybe its science fiction and I should sit back and just watch and not try and analyze."
"mjjusa-1","6","1","4","26 November 2007"," Twilight Zone revisited
","I have not read the novella nor have I read a Stephen King book in years. I wondered as I watched this movie whether his serious accident had changed his life view dramatically. Whether the unfairness of his injuries and the random nature of his personal tragedy had changed his view of religion and religious people. Because beyond the mist and its denizens there are monstrous Christians portrayed as murderous fanatics and warped psychopaths used as curious plot devices among the humans trapped and trying to survive.<br/><br/>The religious discussions go on and on as if in a reworked 'Lions for Lambs.' We are made to feel as if the irrationality of literal biblical interpretation is somehow more irrational than a plot involving creatures from another dimension with a taste for humans. But, the movie as a movie works as a long familiar Twilight Zone plot...you know: group dynamics in the face of inexplicable events. I kept waiting for the camera to pull back and reveal the entire plot as some evil experiment to determine human breaking points.<br/><br/>It isn't really a scary film, more of a tense film. The misty monsters become almost familiar and fill familiar roles right down to living human pupae acting as grotesque hosts of grotesque spidery thingees. But, it is a confusing menagerie of evil insects with no natural order to them...some are like demented wasps, others refugees from prehistoric times, and a few are huge and lurch around making noises and looking like War of the Worlds machines. Some of the acting seemed false to me especially the interaction of father to child and the burgeoning romance between father and the new teacher in town played out while the mother/wife has been lost in the mist.<br/><br/>The ending is shocking and is a Frank Darabontian addition rather than King's idea of a proper conclusion. I'll let others determine whether the religious caricatures spring from King's loss of faith during his painful recovery, are a comment on current events, or are as much overkill as the overkill of the ending.<br/><br/>Well worth my $6.50 matinée price but I might have felt cheated at premium rates. Seemed totally over the top in its anti religion bias to this agnostic but former altar boy. But, several of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episodes in reaction to his experiences in combat during WWII were also used to prick the bubble of mindless faith as well. And, we live in times where flesh eating beasts from another dimension can be compared to evangelical Christians to drive box office."
"montever","9","1","4","26 November 2007"," Utterly Terrifying and Effective, Even If Ending is Unsatisfying
","This is one of the most effectively done horror/science fiction movies to come out of Hollywood in years. Even though I read the short story, the sense of reality in the film totally creeped me out. In fact, I was on the edge, or jumping out of my seat, for the whole movie. I thought the initial mist overwhelming the store scenes were so believable...the sense of claustrophobia and suppressed panic was stupendous. I did find most of the creatures very well done, although the tentacle thing was cheesy.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the ending. Sure, it's true to life, and could have happened that way I suppose, but it just makes everything seem so pointless...all the forays into danger, the courageous run to the outside world. Finally, it seemed out of character with David's character development. He could NOT have done that to his own child. No matter what the ultimate fate, at that point they still had some options."

I would have stopped watching the rest of this ridiculously bad movie if I hadn't read somewhere that ""the ending is one of the best ending of movies ever made""... I was expecting something good at the end... but the end was, once again, stupid and hard to believe. That the main character kill his own son and friends because there are some monsters out there is ridiculous to me. Do rabbits kill themselves because there are foxes out there? Please. Once again, it's taking people for stupid and cowards.
Also, was it supposed to be a horror movie? It's not scary for a second, it's just boring.

"MDavenp900","1","2","14","10 June 2019"," Entertain or mock Christians? What was the real goal?
","Perhaps the worst ""horror movie"" I have ever seen, and I've seen many decades of them. First, the premise was ridiculous. Second, the ""monster"" was an octopus on land. Third, people who saw strangers arrive bloodies and claiming ""Something's out there!"" were immediately forgotten by a main character who claimed his next-door-neighbor was simply trying to embarrass him. Fourth, well, no matter how many shrieks and bloodies bodies, it was laughable not scary. That, however, isn't the major sin of this 2 hr waste of time.<br/><br/>How is it people with no real knowledge of Christians always think they can portray them, and always do so in the worst light? No one has ever acted like the character in the movie, but if your goal is to influence those with no more knowledge than you have, just make stuff up with the confidence that you won't be found out. By the way, ""Revelations"" isn't a Bible book. We can begin there. Liberals run amok on this one and I have to wonder. Why don't they mock Muslims the same way?<br/><br/>Pitiful. Don't waste your time."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","5","11 October 2017"," I am still shivering
","It is not a great masterpiece but it is a good film. <br/><br/>You will recognize all King's main ideas. First, after a storm during the night, on the following day, all the damage is measured and checked and there is a lot. The main family, the father is an artist, have been severely impacted and they foresee some problem with the next door neighbor because one of his trees has destroyed their wooden pier on the lake. They discover then that from the other side of the lake a mist is rising. They nevertheless go to the town to get some groceries. The father and the son go and they take the next door neighbor who is black and whose car was destroyed by one of his trees. We will learn later on he is a New York Lawyer. <br/><br/>When they are in the store the mist arrives and something inside that mist attacks person and the store.<br/><br/>The film emphasizes a lot some reactions, particularly the reaction of a lady who is claiming she is the vessel of God. At first she is more or less disregarded, neglected even rejected, but after the first attacks or signs of the beast in the mist she will manage to make the majority of the customers in the store believe it is the punishing hand of God and she will manage to orient the anger of these people into a galvanized hatred of some individuals requiring some punishment, purification and then human sacrifice, and more particularly of a child, the only child in the store, the son of the artist. Stephen King has always been vocal against religious fundamentalists, but here Darabont seems to have increased the trait.<br/><br/>The second feature you will recognize is that this mist is caused by some extreme research of some armed forces close at hand in a base doing some research on the forms of life in parallel worlds and their attempt to open a window between our world and theirs. The storm was so violent that it disrupted the security and protection and the window became an open door and the mist brought along a whole set of some kinds of giant predators of insect or alien types. Flying insects, running and crawling insects, giant monstrosities in which many species are crossed from insect to octopus exhibiting the practice of the famous cinematographic Aliens that lay their eggs in living organisms that will die when the eggs hatch. That's more or less added to Stephen King's novella.<br/><br/>The third element is the systematic supremacist approach of many, most people in this crowd against the only black man, the only artist, all those who have witnessed the first attack in the back and pushed it away with one victim, a bag boy, who was dragged away. These supremacists just pretend this is irrational and absurd, a lie and a bad taste prank. It is not white supremacy that is dealt with here but the general state of mind of many people in a fearful and frightening situation: they look for the minority people around them and accuse them of being responsible for the problem. The worst supremacist in this crowd is, of course, the female guru and preacher announcing the apocalypse and reading the Book of Revelation. Anyone who is not on her side is against God and all those who are against God are responsible for the anger of God and have to be sacrificed, purified, etc.<br/><br/>This supremacist ideology is used by some to capture influence and power but it can only develop on the basis of some frustration and fear, mostly as a collective mood. This is marvelously developed and demonstrated in this film. Here again, it goes probably slightly farther than what I remember from the original novella.<br/><br/>But the main change is the end. In Stephen King's novella, everything went back to normal in the morning, more or less, but here certainly not. The presence of military forces to recapture the territory by burning it all and rescuing the few survivors is in line with some Kingian elements but it is pushed farther than even what King does in The Stand. I won't tell more about it: you have to discover it yourself.<br/><br/>The film is very good as for most of the special effects, even if some props seem to be a little bit cheap. The creatures are perfect and have so many designs and structures that they are in many ways effective, or would be with any younger audience. All animals that are despised and rejected by humans out of fear or disgust are used here, small and big. What do I say, big, giant of course is the proper word, out-worldly? Some are marvelously creative.<br/><br/>Entertaining and yet also dense with meaning. This film will entertain a moonless night of yours when a tempest has cut off power and the next door river or lake have submerged the ground floor of your house. Take refuge in the attic on the third level and use your satellite dish to get the film from the cloud and a small generator to get electricity. Be prepared in one word. Just build a four-yard- high translucid wall of some indestructible fiber all around your territory to keep undesired aliens out. And just have some kind of dome on top that can be raised when necessary. If you have one or two cubic meters of liquid oxygen, you will be able to survive more than a week. <br/><br/>In other words, VIVA LA MUERTE! But for people outside your tribe only.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

At an above 7 rating, this movie is one of the few that makes me question all the mass ratings on IMDb. I get how it is a lesson on how not to act and how humans can be more harmful than helpful to each other but this was not a horror movie it was a lesson in idiocy and not enjoyable to watch in any way for me. I wouldn't even have finished it if I wasn't watching it with friends.

First off, the script is awkward and unnatural. The writers are trying their best to make David seem like some hero father while Mr.Norton is of course, the noncomplying, arrogant ass-hole who doesn't believe a word they say when they mention the tentacles and completely over exaggerates the entire scene when he's supposed to be ""flipping out"" at the four men who are telling him the truth. Oh, then the tentacles. ""What the hell"" was literally my reaction when the tentacles were first revealed on screen.

This is a creature feature done to perfection. The creatures are really scary. It is scarier than most cartoon splatter slasher movies. This is what a horror movie should be.<br/><br/>Like the other Darabont-King movies, this one is not just the simple genre movie. It is about the characters.

"vip-danii","9","1","5","20 March 2013"," A Really Good Movie, But Would've Been Better If...
","Yes, a great movie, as expected. I was quite impressed with the actors; they really did a fine job -- all of them.<br/><br/>I usually try to avoid movies, where one of the lead actors has a kid. If there's a kid in a movie, you can expect this kid to (1) take up more movie time than necessary, (2) be disgustingly obnoxious most of the time, (3) be accompanied by a hysterical, over-protective, and equally annoying and obnoxious parent.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that none of the above was present in this movie.<br/><br/>It's a genuinely good piece of work, but here's what spoilt it for me:<br/><br/>(1) The ending was a real stinker. I mean, do they think people want an ending like that? It was very, very disappointing, depressing and completely unnecessary. Extremely inconsiderate of them to let us (the viewers) down so bad.<br/><br/>(2) They should have developed the story more. We never really get to learn *anything* about this mist or the nature of experiments that it was a consequence of. Surely, it would've been more interesting if the soldiers, trapped in the supermarket, knew something more about the whole thing -- other than ""military experiments must've opened a door to another dimension"".<br/><br/>(3) The whole religious lady situation was a tad too unrealistic. It was good in the beginning, but when she demanded they ""sacrifice"" the soldier, and then - the kid... it started getting ridiculous. I can understand if ONE already demented religious fanatic goes insane and stops making any sense, but the whole group serving this nut and fulfilling her whims?? Sure, they're a bunch of dumb hillbillies, but NO ONE is THAT retarded.<br/><br/>(4) We never really get to see the monsters. We see a tentacle at one point, and some over-sized mosquitoes, but the ""main"" monsters that are, supposedly, inside the mist, never make an appearance.<br/><br/>(5) The dude - Brent Norton... he was supposed to be arrogant, not dumb as a rock. It was so annoying and unrealistic when he flat out refused to accept common sense. Even though people are offering him to SEE proof for himself, he refuses to listen to anyone. We already have a religious nut that behaves this same exact way, so there was no need to turn THIS guy into a village-idiot-in-denial as well.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie was very good. I'd definitely watch it again (but, naturally, skip the depressing ending)."

The movie wasn't that bad at all, until the incredibly stupid ending. ""Oh no we ran out of gas, lets shoot everyone in the head including my son"". REALLY!? How moronic! Especially when the movie shows them driving by numerous abandoned vehicles as they try to escape the mist. So instead of maybe, oh I don't know, getting out the car and trying another vehicle, maybe siphoning some gas, or trying to find shelter, they decide to commit suicide? Hahaha, completely stupid. Especially when the entire movie shows them trying to survive and make smart decisions, then all the sudden at the end they all get a case of stupid. I am amazed that people have actually rated this movie so high, I guess it just goes to show that most people are idiots, including the director of this movie.

S. government are always up to secret stuff and what if they were experimenting with per say other dimensions and time travel only to have opened another dimension and not close the porthole so to speak allowing a mist that contains all these third dimension creatures to escape into our world?? Well we see first hand what happens when a tiny close knit community living at the bottom of a huge army base atop of a mountain allows a mist filled with what i described above to wreak havoc. Trapping a majority of its citizens in a small grocery store together. Lets see in this grocery store we have the citizen with a chip on his shoulder and because he is the only person of colour that the whole town is secretly plotting against him, the town biker, the grocery store manager who despite all thats happened still gives one of his employees heck for drinking beer on the job ( if you see what kind of creatures and humongous type insects this mist produces i know would it make myself wanna tip back a few!) We also have the town crazy woman/ head bible thumper Mrs Carmody holed up with them turning a few of the trapped shoppers into her own personal cult following. Mrs Carmody is played with great conviction by Marcia Gay Harden. This besides being a great thriller it is packed full of CGI creatures providing pretty good realism to the film."

"fantasyescapist","Null","1","5","10 July 2008"," A memorable, suspenseful horror with an distressing ending that stays and left me horrified - it affected my very being.
","Acting: Well played by all, with no noticeably weak performers. Standout actors are the nut case fundamentalist 'Christian' woman, Toby Jones and the atheist man suddenly turned to God. <br/><br/>Pacing: Pretty tight, with fade outs to black in between each of the scenes give it a reflective effect. The novella I've never read, but the script has it's few witty, laugh-out-loud lines amidst the horror. It delivers real, genuine jumps and scares and parts I was very squeamish in. This, in my opinion, is what in terms of horror, Cloverfield looks up to and admires, but can never be half as good as. That hyped up monster film only wishes it was this effective and more. A sort of Lord Of The Flies in a small town supermarket, as a makeshift fort against the terrors lurking outside and what happens as people seem to follow things and what one particular woman says that they normally wouldn't give time of day to. As said in the film, people can do abnormal things if you scare them enough <br/><br/>Cinematography: Well, the special effects were very good. The weird large insects and mysterious tentacles did scare and unsettle me so they did they job effectively, where other means couldn't have been used. Gory deaths  one particular one happens more off screen are chilling. The Mist itself has a foreboding power to it that's is captured well on film  that uncertainty of what's a few feet in front of a person is well realised. It rakes up tension with expertise.<br/><br/>Music: I think their were these apocalyptic type choir songs nearer the end that were very good and the score is probably my stand out this year, just in terms of how it really adds to the film and more.<br/><br/>Overall: I was frozen in my screening seat with an expression of horror-struck unbelievably and I'm sure I looked very worried  I couldn't move for some moments. It is hard to explain but I couldn't cry cause it was if all my emotion was sucked out of me and I could only stare into space. It is simply the most depressing ending I've seen so far since Requiem For A Dream & When The Wind Blows  no, actually it's worse that both of those. Talk about feeling like all hope in the world is lost and left in despair. All good memories are gone for those moments walking home to catch my bus, and I felt empty. Both religion and science are questioned - I think it's more about obvious worries shown about fundamentalist cults and the dangers unhinged members can pose on the rest of a venerable society as well as the consequences of science experimenting and exploring into unknown realms. It's a powerful film, that leaves me with inner-moral questions and just delivers on the level of scares and horror. Good characterisation, plot and some brilliant turns from the actors really put a lasting effect in my mind. Even if this lacks the feel goodness Shawshank had, it's in ways more powerful. I've never felt so bad and bleak emotionally after seeing any film this year, so kudos to Darabont for staying with this thoroughly dark conclusion to another of his King's adaptations"

","I just watched this movie about a year after it came out and it sucked. I enjoyed some parts of it, I really liked the human interest part of the movie for an example. It was more thrilling than the monster parts anyways. The religious lady was a great add I think, she created a villain we all loved to hate and I have to say I loved it when she got her brains blown out. But the horrible attempt at a monster movie was just comical, I found myself laughing at giant bugs flying around the store and mass chaos all around. The graphics were a joke, and the overall plot of opening inter-dimensional portals was just bogus. I would have enjoyed the ending a lot, if I could actually take this movie seriously. I could see where the director was going with it, but I just had to laugh when no more than 5 minutes later the army comes rolling up and there's no more of ""the mist"".

","I can understand the stress and horror experienced by the few supposed to be sane people in the store. I can't understand the mass paralysis that came over these few when they went to the pharmacy. Instead of running immediately because they knew from experience they could not fight the creatures without enormous physical effort, they stood rooted to the spot so more of them could die. It seemed never to have occurred to anyone to ask ""Where is the military?"" After all, they could reasonable expect some type of military response to other dimensional creatures, who I noted where not immune to damage. I mean if you could kill on with a broom handle you sure could exterminate them with flame throwers, tanks, 30-cal machine guns, anti-tank rockets, and fast-shooting machine guns on helicopters. Any of these were more than a match for any ""monster"" shown in the film. I was amazed that the main character gave up hope after seeing an 80-foot slow-moving monster and hearing other monsters and shot everyone. The group he was with in the market were not in a major area and could reasonably expect tanks to roll up within a day or two. But everyone acted like it was the end of the world, when it clearly wasn't. I agree that Mrs. Carmody was a pain in the ass and needed to die eventually, but why couldn't her histrionics and inciting tactics have been foretold and thwarted? This movie was not like the Langoliers where those people were out of time and had to get back into synchronization with time. A mist came in and monsters appeared. No big deal, get the army in!"

But when i watched this film i was constantly irritated with the stupidity of the characters. Being rather incompetent at almost every task, and i know people are going to say that they were in shock but no person would ever be so dumb. I was literally shouting at the screen in disbelief at what they were or weren't doing. Their attempt to save their lives was so poor and short lived if it were real i would feel ashamed to be classed in the same species bracket. Other than the actual story the acting was below average, but the film was shot pretty well if you ignore the cheap and clichéd fades used to change scene. Its a shame the plot is good and a better screenplay would have made so much difference. i would not recommend this film to my friends but if you want to watch a horror/thriller and have no access to anything else watch it.

If you want us to believe that a group of people would change to the will of a ranting religious extremist in the space of 2 days you're going to have to do better than that. witnessing the halfassed preacher woman character fail at delivering a convincing religious persuader just ruined any mileage the other characters managed. <br/><br/>some of the others were OK. Toby Jones did a good job of his character, and Thomas Jane was also passable except in the end scene.<br/><br/>how ever did this get a rating in the high 7's. anyone who's actually seen it and didn't work on the movie will argue with that figure. 4-5 tops. honestly."
"scubergmu","8","1","5","12 December 2007"," Dark Mist
","I'm gonna be up front about this, my review will give away certain things about the ending. Stop reading right now, if you have not already seen The Mist.<br/><br/>Okay, this movie is one for serious horror buffs. I just got out of a showing, and as we were filing out, a guy across the isle looked at me and said, about the ending: ""Wow, that's messed up."" This movie possessed a signature King quality, in that it managed to creep you out with both human and supernatural elements. And it brought both of those elements big time. <br/><br/>The Mist really had a far greater quality to it that your standard horror movie out these days. I had expected that when I saw that the director was Frank Durabont. He's now taken on three very different Stephen King stories, and I think made the three best, out of the dozens of King adaptations made over the years. The endings were all very different as well, one being blissfully happy and optimistic, another subdued and somewhat bittersweet, and the third incredibly intense and dark. <br/><br/>As for the cast, if you're a fan of Durabont's movies, you've seen a number of these people before. Jeffrey DeMunn and Bill Sadler were excellent as always. I'm sure that Marcia Gay Harden had the most fun during filming, she really was a scene-stealer playing an outrageous religious fundamentalist woman. Actually though my favorite performance was turned in by English actor Toby Jones. He doesn't look like an action star, but his character really was, and I just loved his style. Tom Jane and Laurie Holden were perfectly fine as our main characters, but to be honest, they're both just so incredibly attractive, I was kinda distracted by that the whole movie. Neither of them really look like anybody you'd actually see in a small town store. <br/><br/>So anyway, as high quality as this movie is, I don't see it as possessing a lot of cross-over appeal. It was among the most intense Stephen King adaptations, and it is not a date movie, unless you're both big fans of the King. This is a dark horror movie, not for beginners. The ending is chilling and leaves you thinking about it over and over again. Stay away if you like to walk out of a movie singing a happy tune."
"WallyGirl10","9","1","5","11 December 2007"," Great Film
","OK so some people will read the book and go see the movie and be completely angry about the ending. As for my opinion... what do you expect? the ending in the book was open-ended and that does not make for a great ending in a movie.. people get angry who haven't read the book and don't understand. Steven King was involved in the making of the film so I am sure they ran the ending by him, if he didn't come up with it himself, and he cleared it to be a suitable ending for viewing audiences.<br/><br/>The movie overall was a great movie that brought out how Steven King was exploring human emotion and group think. I really wish people would look deeper into movies you would enjoy them so much more. For those who haven't seen the movie I challenge you to go into the movie and enjoy the horror and monster theme but also look for the message in the movie. Watch how one lady is able to effectively bring people to her side that God is judging them. Watch how they attack each other instead of working together. And if you really want to get into it, think ""what would I do in this situation"". People today are too into get entertained in the most surfaced way they can. But if you really WATCH movies and think about what exactly is happening then you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>This was a fantastic movie. And I will definitely be going back to watch it again. I recommend it highly."

","A group of people get trapped in a grocery store after a mysterious mist rolls down from the hills after a storm. Some get scared, some turn religious and others become heroes. What caused this mist and how can anyone survive it? You'll have to watch to find out.<br/><br/>This film contained a lot of actors who are largely unknown or have a face you might recognize but not the name. In a film that has an ""ensemble cast"" this is probably the best way to make all characters equal. Thomas Jane (""Punisher"") is the lead, and others you might recognize appear such as William Sadler (""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Demon Knight"" and the Grim Reaper from ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey""). Overall, though, these are lesser-knowns.<br/><br/>I will give you my honest reaction to this film: I wanted to walk out on it. I really did. It had fade-in and fade-out like a TV movie, it had a large group of people in an apocalyptic setting which is such a Stephen King cliché. And when the tentacle showed up, I saw some truly awful CGI work (although it got better with the bugs... at least a little). But after the walking out feeling faded (which I haven't felt since ""Herbie Fully Loaded"") I started to think it was okay...<br/><br/>When it was okay, I thought the idea was good and the characters were alright. I mean, all the characters were so one-dimensional (""the oppressed minority"", ""the bumbling hick"", ""the hero"", ""the religious nut"") but it worked alright. The religious lady was so over-powering that I was unsure if she was a really good actress or overdoing it. I wouldn't have written / directed it to be such a strong character, but that's just me. Again I waited, and it got better.<br/><br/>Of course, as always, the ending must remain a secret. But that's the reason I ended up giving it a decent rating, because all the bad things about the film seem to be forgotten once the very dramatic end comes around. I expected better from the man who brought us ""Shawshank"" and ""The Green Mile"" (I mean Darabont, not King) but it was still beautiful in its own way.<br/><br/>There isn't much more to say about the film. It's suspenseful, it has some gore (no nudity). It's not really very scary, and there's not much reason to watch it twice. I mean, it's really good, but it's nothing that screams ""movie of the year"". It's a group of people trapped together to face certain death. If you've read King or seen his movies, this is old news to you. But I recommend it for one viewing. I guess if you want to watch it again, that's your choice... I don't plan to see it again unless I get tricked into it or get paid or there's free dinner involved."

","A storm wreaks havoc on a small north-eastern community. The following morning, after he inspects the damage, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son (Nathan Gamble) go into town to purchase some essentials only to find themselves held captive by a menacing mist teaming with all sorts of slithering nasties, flying uglies, and creepy crawlies.<br/><br/>There is nothing unique about ""The Mist"". The film is ""Jumanji"" meets ""The Fog"". Let's see... we've got our military experiments gone awry along with Stephen King-typical religious fanatics and small town hicks. Thomas Jane as the main protagonist does a decent job here. However, I was disappointed with the fragmented and haphazard way Andre Braugher's character, the paranoid litigant, was yo-yoed in and out of the film. I was equally disappointed by the idiocy of William Sadler's character, the local yokel simpleton bully, and especially Marcia Gay Harden, who played the part of the religious zealot. I found her as distastefully obnoxious in this film as I did in ""Mystic River"". Yes, I know she is meant to be obnoxious, but she runs with it all just a bit too far, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>The only true horror of the film is its ending. I won't rob you of that experience, but be prepared to be unprepared. It is trademark King. Many folks have voiced strong dissatisfaction with the ending, claiming it as nonsensical, too disturbing, leaving them in a sickened and perplexed mood. I suggest that the ending of this film is horror in its purest sense, and horror doesn't have a name, doesn't feel warm and fuzzy, and definitely is void of logic. The ending is also quite congruent in the way King habitually concludes his short stories and novellas. Unfortunately, as is almost always the case with films adapted from King's novels (The Mist was a novella) ""The Mist"" was an overall flaccid exercise."

The real tragedy is what the government accidentally brings through this ominous portal  terror and horror like never before.<br/><br/>What was once a peace-loving environment becomes a feeding frenzy for flesh-eating abominations from hell. David Drayton (Jane) is just a regular dad going about his business when an electric storm sends a giant tree crashing through his living room.

I think if the budget was a little higher, they could've made it look better. Seeing as the film seems to be doing well, I think they should go back and re-do some of the f/x for the DVD release. Also, some of the dialog seemed a bit awkward, strained.<br/><br/>Firstly, I've never read the story, but I very much enjoyed this film. It truly is a fascinating exploration into human nature during inconceivably and inexplicably horrifying circumstances. I also enjoyed the inter-dimensional sci-fi aspect; that entire concept was on my mind long after the film was over. There is much talk about the ending; I feel that, as tragic as it was, it was certainly bold and entirely appropriate.<br/><br/>Any minor criticisms I have of this film are far outweighed by how compelling it is as a whole.

","This is a perfect example of Stephen King, suspense, action, horror, terrible ending. The movie held my attention throughout, and character development was excellent, Kind does an excellent job of selling you a character, from David Drayton the loving father, to Ms. Carmody the bible thumping religious fanatic that you love to hate with a fiery passion I might add. The creatures are top-rate and I will admit there were parts where I was on the edge of my seat, and slammed back by a fleeting appearance of one of the ""creatures"", but my problem is with the end of the movie. A horror movie is supposed to give you a sense of impending doom, by killing characters and placing others in hopeless situations, then all the antagonists are supposed to get their just deserts, this happens, then the protagonists are supposed to make that one last final ditch effort to pull it off then your hopes are fulfilled when they make it through their struggle. Let's just say that this movie builds your hope up towards the end and then dashes it in a way that you just want to go sit in the fog and shoot yourself.

"graphium_weiskei3","7","1","5","25 November 2007"," Good Overall
","I might want to start by commenting that I have not read this short story in two years, and have just gone to see the movie. Overall, if you have not read the story, then the movie should have been amazing. If you have, I might say you could be a little disappointed at the ending. Some key ""bonding"" scenes have been taken out, which is good overall, but somehow takes away from the characters, and weakens the plot connection between David and Amanda. Also, there was less interaction with Billy than I thought there to be. Yet, I have to say, if you have read the story, it would be good to watch it. Most book/film transactions do not go over smoothly, but this is pretty good. I found the first part of the movie amazing. The special effects were also amazing. The store and acting are impeccable, as are the special effects for the ""Giant tentacles"" in the loading dock. There is definitely parts of this movie that will have the whole theater laughing. I have to say that the point at which the movie begins it's downfall is the pharmacy. After thinking about this, it has to be hard to put such a story into a movie. I am still disappointed with the ""Giang Bug"" that towers over them, which I thought would be completely different, and the ending was very very disappointing, and very sad. I feel like he should have just looked the soldier in the eye and yelled ""Shoot me!"" until he did. You do end up feeling extremely bad for, David though. Getting back, I found it to be a good movie, and one which I would recommend, if you really wanted to see it. I don't think that I would leave the theater to miss the end, even!"

"ex_machina-915-971943","3","1","6","20 August 2015"," Loquacious, ersatz, misanthropic. Don't bother.
","The Mist<br/><br/>Not sure how this movie received so many positive reviews. Even critic reviews were generally positive. Well, I beg to disagree. Here is what I found problematic with it (SPOILERS!):<br/><br/>1. Way too much useless dialog. It's a staple of Steven King books to feature crazy holy-rollers. Apparently, Darabont felt the need to include King's novella-length religious screeds in full in the script. It not only completely destroys the pacing of the film, but is as grating as it is boring to have to listen to. We get it--she's a crazy bible-thumper. Do we need to listen to her insane rantings every five minutes for minutes on end for the entire duration of the film? Seriously--do we?<br/><br/>2. Could the people behave any more stupidly? Turn generator on to open garage door. Shut off generator. Tentacles grab the guy by the door. Turn generator back on and close garage door on said tentacles? NO! Stand there for five minutes while the tentacles eviscerate the man, and only once he's been dragged out into the mist do you figure it's a good time to restart the generator and close the door.<br/><br/>There are creatures in the mist, says some dude. I don't believe you, says another dude. Bring out a piece of the alien tentacle you chopped off to prove it to him? NO! Present NONE of the evidence that is readily available to convince him that he should not go out into the mist...and thus, he goes out into the mist...and gets eaten.<br/><br/>Giant insects are pounding against the plate glass windows. Oh-- they're attracted to the lights, you deduce. Therefore, turn off all the lights? NO! Turn ON the brightest lights so that the insects-- and their pterodactyl-like predators--know exactly where to go. By no means ever tell anyone to turn off those lights--just leave them on while your safe haven gets overrun by giant bugs and pterodactyls!<br/><br/>Go into the pharmacy and find people strung up to the walls in cobwebs. Giant spiders emerge and start shooting acidic spider web at you, while taking the weapons right out of your hands. Run away? NO! Stand there looking terrified until enough people are killed by the acidic spider webs, and, only after you feel that the death toll is sufficient should you decide that it's probably a good time to run for your life.<br/><br/>3. The CGI is awful. Unless it's for an ironically made movie for SyFy, there is no reason for CGI to look so cheap in the year 2007.<br/><br/>4. Dark, eff-ed up ending. I'm all for dark twists, but King's misanthropy shines through here with what happens at the end. If it weren't for all the faults above, the ending might have hit me with some sense of gravitas. As it was--i.e., being a B horror flick--the ending felt simply gratuitously macabre. Needlessly killing children is not pop horror cinema; it is simply derangement, masquerading as depth.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I found the acting surprisingly solid all around. But it wasn't enough to save this stinker for me. I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone, even those looking for an easy-viewing popcorn flick."

","I saw the trailer to this film, and thought it wasn't worth watching, it looked mainstream,'cheesy' and stereotypical. But then my friend rented it and on the DVD cover it had great reviews from critics such as Empire and it stated that the ending was spectacular! I should've trusted my instincts. One critic said that this movie had more originality than a thousand Saws, they had the audacity to say that, granted Saw as a series isn't very good but the first was very original and fresh. This movie was far from that, It basically poorly combined several sub-horrors together(Zombies,Disasters,Aliens). There are so many scenes that you have seen before, i saw elements of Silent Hill, Evolution, War of the worlds etc all tastelessly wound together. And with each of these scenes you could see what the director(brilliant director btw) tried to do but failed. The horror the film relies on is Jumping scares and awful special Fx which is very common in today's modern films (hence why The ring, which instead focused on developing an eerie atmosphere, was so successful.) The plot itself just tried to cram it's events in as fast as possible leaving no time for development, especially for it's characters(who remain one-dimensional throughout)and so none of it is plausible it's just sloppy. The supposedly 'brilliant' ending, which was the one factor that kept me watching the film, was such a let down, i'm so glad i didn't pay to watch this because it really isn't what a lot of reviews have made it out to be,in fact the mist relies on it's ending to support the overall outlook the audience has on the film, but it really isn't genuine and is completely plastic, it just makes you realize that it was done sheerly for shock value and i think it was unsuccessful even at that. I haven't used many examples and i really wanted to but i didn't want to have any spoilers. I do recommend people watch this just to see how terrible it is, but if you want to watch a good horror, stay clear of this, it's yet another mainstream movie that relies on old and cheap tactics that producers feel safe using because they don't want to experiment in case of a financial flop. Watch silent hill or the orphanage if you want to see a true twenty-first century horror."

","All in all, not a bad movie. You have to f**k up pretty bad if you want to spoil King. Would definitely get more points if not for The Ending. I loved Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody. She's not what I pictured reading the novella but Harden delivers! Her Mrs. Carmody is fanatic and crazy, just as she should be. Thomas Jane was maybe a bit bland for my taste. He has his two faces, (furrowed brow or not-furrowed brow) and Kings characters tend to ask a bit more out of an actor. <br/><br/>But as many have asked before me... Why the ending? The Mist is a beloved King story for me. I love the open ending in the novella and hate it at the same time. 'Cause let's face it, you want to know what happens to the characters you read about! But this movie ending I didn't want to know. It was horrible, cruel and just too sad. The novella ending leaves stuff maddeningly unsolved, sure, but also open for your imagination.

Along with several other people. The father, son and three other people make a run for it in a vehicle to find the end of the mist. They run out of gas and have only four bullets.

This is the most accurate portrayal the writer had. In general the movie was bad and the ended made me want to throw up. I know the writer based this off a Stephan King book, all i hope is the big as at least good because the mist was a waste of time. If you are looking for something scary to rent, this is not for you.

","The Mist was a lot better than I thought when looking at 2 trailers. I don't like most of Stephen King's movies. The only one's I like are Carrie, The Shining, and Pet Cemetery is OK. I'm definitely adding this to my horrors. The Mist itself contains several species of unknown monsters. I'll try not to spoil too much on what some of them look like.<br/><br/>The main character played by Thomas Jane as David Drayton is painting at night when a storm comes. He hides in a cellar with his wife Stephanie and young son Billy. The storm destroyed part of the families's house and their boat house. He goes over to his neighbor Brent Norton over a dispute of a fallen tree caused by the storm. These two you can tell do not get along, but David does him a favor by driving him to a store with him to repair both of their homes. Your introduced a little to some other towns people in the store. But a few minutes later mist goes in fast over the whole town. A man comes in with a bleeding nose running franticly in the store telling everyone someone took away his friend in the mist, not knowing what it was.<br/><br/>This is where all their troubles get complex. It's what I appreciate about this film is so many complications, the creatures themselves come in different sizes, none seem to be able to be dealt with in the same way. These creatures seem only interested in people for nothing but food, all animal instinct. There is a cause to these creatures, but I won't spoil that.<br/><br/>David tries leading the people, since many of them are looking for some direction of what to do in this situation. Laruie Holden as Amanda Dumfries, who is a teacher in town, helps David take care of his son, and talks to him. I think when David and Amanda talked in between defending themselves against the creatures it helped keep some of his sanity. Ollie, who works at the store, helps quite a bit, and is a great help to David too.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as the monsters kill off people, it causes panic and fear. An extremist of Christinity Mrs. Carmody uses a few quotes from her bible to try to convince everyone to listen to her, or the creatures will continue coming after them. I don't think they're trying to get on bashing the Christian religion. I know it's popular in most Hollywood movies and TV. I take it a lot of the towns folks are religious too, and not twisting it to Mrs. Carmodie's version. But they're afraid, and she's the only one giving explanations. So now the people start turning into a threat to each other. David and the few with him do not have much of a choice to stay in the store, with people going insane.<br/><br/>I like the whole situation, not everyone agrees what to do being trapped in the store. The few creatures they see cause panic and fear, but there are probably many more types they haven't seen. Some think it's god's judgement, being told by Mrs. Carmody. Fear is making everyone make their choices, even David and his group make their own choices out of fear. And not every action David does always works out. It's very hard to predict what happens to everyone.<br/><br/>The ending itself I thought was great. I know a lot of people may not like it, but there is irony and a little moral at the end. Definitely not a cheap tacked on ending. The book's ending I've heard is different, more open ended. And Stephen King movies, though I may not like most of them, usually doesn't have everything work out wonderfully in the end for everyone. This movie has a lot of suspense, plenty of dialogue, and gives a fear of the unknown of what's coming next, and fear of what anyone can become in that situation."
"dfranzen70","7","1","6","25 November 2007"," Poor ending, but overall gory and chilling
","Stephen King's 1983 short story (more of a novella, really) is pretty well realized for the big screen by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption), although the ending might leave viewers cold, not chilled. The effects are excellent, as Hollywood strangely (and wisely!) decided to ease off the overproduced special effects for a change, and the result is that when we do see the creatures, we're suitably terrified, especially since the camera never lingers long on any of them.<br/><br/>The basic setup is that a storm of the century has shut down the power in a small New England town, and the next morning a thick mist is rolling across the town's large lake. Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) gathers his eight-year-old son and, accompanied by his caustic neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), heads to the supermarket to load up on groceries. When they get there, they find that pretty much everyone else in town has the same idea. And it seems like just the usual bad-weather madness until a local citizen bursts into the store, blood on his chest, screaming about how creature from the mist took his friend, and dadgum it everyone better GET INSIDE CLOSE THE DOOR AAAH THEY'RE COMING, and sure enough, as the doors are closed, the mist comes rolling in, and people stay the heck where they are. <br/><br/>But it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary mist, and that old man might have been on to something - something IS out there, but the mist is so thick no one can tell what it is. And that's where the story really gets under your skin. What manner of creature is outside the store's walls? Is it faster than a man trying to get to his car? Is it small, but vicious? Or is it gigantic? Is it even benign? (No, it's not.)<br/><br/>In other, less-deft hands, a story like this would have been a typical monster movie, as our Intrepid Hero saves the world from sure destruction. But this isn't about man versus the monster, it's about man versus the unknown - and man versus man. <br/><br/>Almost all of the action takes place inside the supermarket. There are level-headed (but scared) people, like Dave, Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), Ollie (Toby Jones), and Irene (Frances Sternhagen), and then there are the so-scared-they're-irrational people, like Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) and Jim Grondin (William Sadler), and Norton. In a lesser movie, the theme would be that all of them must work together in order to survive, but that theme isn't given a chance here, as would be the case in real life. There's no rousing speech about how everyone's in this together; people become unhinged and unwilling to listen to reason at the drop of a hat, because the unknown of the mist is too much to bear.<br/><br/>That's where Mrs. Carmody comes in. She's a Bible-thumping fanatic of the Old Testament, and she sees the mist and its denizens as a sign from the Almighty, and as the movie progresses she becomes more and more like a seer to the easily swayed - and sees herself as a righteous martyr who will someday sit beside God. In other words, a disaster like the mist gives a kook like Mrs. Carmody the perfect opportunity to save souls, whether they want to be or not, and her zeal gives the lesser-minded individuals something they can hold on to, rather than using their minds for practical survival.<br/><br/>Dave acts as the de facto leader of the survivors, mostly because no one else steps forward, not even the three almost-on-leave soldiers trapped in the store. But not only must he find a way to get out of the store and past the creatures, but he has to deal with the escalating insanity of Mrs. Carmody, whose rantings attract a larger and larger congregation, ending in tragedy.<br/><br/>The only real issue I have with the movie is the ending, which differs wildly from that in King's original printed story. You would think that a Hollywood ending would be more tangible, thus giving the viewer better closure. Well, we do get some closure, but the result is that you feel like you've been kicked in the stomach. The finale is so unsatisfying, you wonder what the heck the preceding two hours were supposed to be for."

","I am somewhat confused after watching this film as to how a great number of the reviews on here give it high marks. I usually consider the ratings on here as fairly accurate. However a 7.2 rating is WAY too generous! More like a 3.2.<br/><br/>Having watched this movie I find myself questioning where the $18,000,000 budget was spent. In fairness, it has some very good acting in it, particularly from Marcia Gay Harden as the bible spouting fear mongering woman who creates hysteria amongst the folk trapped inside the store in order to survive. She is the only character in the movie who gives it any kind of real tension for my money. The special effects in the early part of the film were hilarious - up until that moment I had hoped the film would deliver as per the reviews and ratings here. Alas, the first special effect spelt the end of any credibility this film might have had. The film might have succeeded if it had been directed in such a way that no creatures were necessary, the kind of suspense Hitchcock could drum up just using style and tension to leave the dark larking in the mist as a figment of our imagination. Instead, some moments in the film were laugh out loud ridiculous. Avoid it!"

","I am surprised by the positive reviews for this film.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this is not a horror film in the true sense of the genre, closer to a thriller maybe, but I can't say there was a scene that gave me a feeling of fear or apprehension. There were however, several that left me angry with the character's actions, which were totally unbelievable. The acting, as far as I'm concerned the acting was poor, and the music was clichéd and kind of annoying.<br/><br/>Essentially, this movie really annoyed me, and the ending, come on! Not one human reaction portrayed in this film was remotely believable. This is not a horror film."
"dcxo","1","1","7","9 November 2009"," Scary...
","Let me start by saying I was a fan of King when he wrote Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, the Talisman was awesome, and the Stand was great even though his endings are weak. The religious/conservative slights in the books never overwhelmed the story. However, an obvious hatred bullies its way onto center stage in this movie. <br/><br/>I have only registered to write this review. I will apologize beforehand if I use material from previous posts, but some other people have conveyed the message perfectly.<br/><br/>'This movie makes dumb people feel smart' is a great example.<br/><br/>This movie leaves a depressing numbness. Not because of the stupid ending, which by the way is really stupid, but because anyone in American society thinks this is a good film. What's scarier than monsters outside the supermarket, monsters in us all when times get hard! Come on, really? I don't want a message, I want to see scary monsters and blood and guts, maybe some boobage but not some weak attempt at exploring the frailty of the human character.<br/><br/>The acting is not unlike that seen in a high school play. Throughout the movie, characters transition between comments very distinctly and clumsily. They would say their part and then it was as if the spotlight shifted to the next person and he/she would take center stage while everyone stood around and stared at them. All they needed was a soap box. ""A monster you say, No Way, I don't believe you"". Hey I got an idea, walk a few steps to the loading dock and see for yourself.<br/><br/>Like many movies nowadays, the characters are very underdeveloped. I couldn't care less what happened to anyone in the supermarket. The horrific (not horrific as in 'Holy Sh*&' but as in 'you've got to be kidding, is this a joke') ending actually makes you giggle at the incredible stupidness. I can just see the director watching intently for the audience's reaction and then being offended or embarrassed when they don't see it as a powerful kick to the emotional gut. And then blaming the audience for being too stupid to comprehend the artistry. And blah, blah, blah, every character was an over-the-top stereotype.<br/><br/>The most distasteful part of the movie is its obvious message against conservatives. The glaring rant against anything Christian or right-wing was vindictive and petty. It's disappointing to me that many people believe Mrs. Carmody is an accurate description of the Christian religion, only to be bolstered by this irresponsible waste of time. Poor pitiful Mr. King and his hatred for American Ideals. Let the Artists rule and the Conservative Military establishment burn, right Mr. King. Not surprising that the 'Hero' is an artist, who ironically ends up failing beyond comparison. Oh, if we could all live in a world of rainbows and unicorns.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie and you are as disappointed as I am, don't say I didn't warn you. If you like this movie than I hope I'm never stuck in a broken elevator with you."

After 10 minutes the film has reached it's point and just gets worse from there. There are a few gruesome moments and one or two loud bangs that might make you jump. If you want to waste 2 hours of your life sat in a cinema feeling frustrated and bored then I would strongly recommend this film. I have nothing positive to say about this film what so ever. Big waste of time, money, effort and space. However if you have ever been surprised by a Scooby Doo ending or shocked by an adulterous affair in a cheesy soap then this film could be for you."
"gradyharp","2","1","7","29 March 2008"," A Movie with Many Problems
","THE MIST has the full panorama of responses, from those who find it 'the best of the Stephen King story adaptations' to those who find it a feeble attempt to wed science fiction with biblical predictions. Frank Darabont has successfully brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success. For this film his gathered a substantial cast, used computer generated graphics well, but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures.<br/><br/>David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake. Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town: could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains? The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling, and while brave David tries to fix it (mind you, in this town with no electricity, the lights in the main store remain on....), he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise. Returning to the storefront, his findings are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations, and the dubious out-of-towner Brent Norton (Andre Braugher). But gradually David gathers some sensible folk (Toby Jones, Chris Owen, et al) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning, the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad. Thus we have two factions: those who side with Mrs. Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape. The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father/son devotion, mass hysteria, mob rule, revenge on the military for loosing these 'other world monsters' on the public, and 'what do we do if this is the end of the earth'. How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others.<br/><br/>So why rate this film with two stars instead of one? Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs. Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him. Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane, and for an action hero, he seems to melt with the circumstances. The movie is long, silly, not scary, and suffers from a weak script. For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile. For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters, pass on this film.

","I'm sorry but as much as I have always loved all of Stephen King's work, I was very disappointed in this movie. I missed the chance to see it in the theater and waited patiently to have it come out on DVD but I wish now that I had never watched it. It seems like it was a waste of 2 hours and it only frustrated me in the end. I couldn't believe the ending. Just the fact that the son woke up right before made me sick to my stomach. And what was the deal with the creatures? Where did they come from, what where they and how did the army all of a sudden get things under control and make the mysterious mist just disappear mysteriously. It all seemed just to thrown together. I'm sure the book explains things in detail so maybe they should have left it as just a book. I am so disappointed in this movie."

","There must be a massive amount of Stephen King fan boys on IMDb because giving a film such this a respectable rating of 7.6 is just downright pathetic. This is no different than your average, run-of-the-mill horror/action flick. The acting was average at best and the plot was just plain boring and predictable. Honestly, I can not think of how anyone can claim that this film was in any way special. I sincerely hope the rating will go down after the movie has been on the market for a bit longer allowing common sense to finally set in.

While walking out of the theater the movie left us in total awe and was a very accurate depiction of human nature at its worst: While under pressure, scared, and trapped. It also shows the three groups people would split into: An ever shrinking group of rational thinkers, A group who turned to religion and punishment, and a group of people in denial thinking nothing bigger than themselves is really happening. It is very rare to find a movie in the genre of horror that will both make you think and also scare you at the same time, and I can guarantee you this film will do both."

","I'm honestly very pleased with Franks Darabont's phenomenal directing and screenplay in The Mist. Being the person that rarely finds horror movies honestly bone-chillingly frightening The Mist, for some reason, really did it for me. Although like all horror movies, the plot revolves around fleeing from what we cannot understand, the unknown, The Mist somehow makes that unknown element so much closer to home, as if this really could happen to the world we live in. The long and short of it is, even though you walk in the theater with you mind set that this is another scary movie and I'll be able to drive home no problem, when you walk out, there's a sliver of your mind that genuinely wonders, Could this happen to me? Despite the excellent script and premise, The Mist delivers a cast of excellent actors and filmography that is top notch. Marcia Gay Harden and Thomas Jane deliver stunning performances throughout. I'm very well pleased.<br/><br/>The Mist really was a worthwhile movie that was quite a highlight of my Thanksgiving break. So much so, I'm considering reading the book to relive the plot firsthand with Stephen King.<br/><br/>The Mist really deserves a 9. great, great great. It'll be worth your money."
"soulhunger2-1","9","1","7","22 November 2007"," A good movie based on a great book.
","Let me start by saying that this is an awesome book-to-film conversion. If you've read the story and liked it, then you probably won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Acting/characters: The acting in this film is not Hollywood overacting. The characters stay human throughout the film. When things get rough, they shake, fumble around, scream, and do things that make little sense when fear clouds their judgment. At first it may seem lame, as though they're not even trying. But in real life, would you be ""trying""? The characters feel like real people, not like actors. My only complaint is about some of the jokes thrown in. Some of them seem more like a script than a real person's reaction, which does detract a bit from the film. 9/10<br/><br/>Story: Well, being based on a book, there's not much to say. The story stays very true to the book except for one part, which still feels very Stephen King. 10/10<br/><br/>Special effects: The computer graphics in this movie are very well done. Not much too much to complain about here. It did seem like it could have been done slightly better in some areas. 9/10<br/><br/>Horror: This movie is scary in more than one way. It's not just about ripping innocent victims apart. It digs into the human mind. When things get bad, people fall apart. These poor grocery-buying citizens don't Rambo their way out of trouble. They are not strong minded supermen and women. They cave in to their fear through denial, religion, and even just plain giving up. While some of the fear comes from the very creepy mist, much also comes from just how weak-minded your average person is and how easily they will give in to pressure. Or how desperateness can cause one to seek any solution, including the extreme or absurd. Also, the horror doesn't come in the form of music building up, just to have a cat pop out of a closet. This film doesn't just take cheap shots at the audience. 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: This movie is a must-see for fans of the book, and recommended for horror fans in general. Everything about this movie seems right, except for the humor in some places which detracted from the realism. 9/10"

However I loved this film from the start.It started out peacefully with a family living by a lake and a storm hits.The tension builds slowly the way i like it so you get to know the characters and nothing is rushed.There was everything in this type of movie I would expect.A tiny bit of comedy (which didn't hurt it) a believable plot,suspense,drama,a little aggravation at a few characters,high-tension among the characters out of fear, and creepy but breathtaking special effects that made the movie that much more believable and realistic.Thomas Jane as David,and Laurie Holden as Amanda were amazing! Of course everyone else was great too, but Thomas Jane especially carried the whole movie.The scenes between him and the others were very well acted.The scene where he had to leave his little son Billy (Nathan Gamble) was sad and very moving.

"MBunge","3","1","9","10 November 2010"," Frank Darabont flunks this IQ test
","The Mist is an appalling film on so many levels. It's stupid. It's shallow. It's pretentious. It's dull. It's unpleasant. It's obvious and feeble attempts to manipulate its audience are equaled in awfulness by its intolerant and ill-conceived moral posturing. This is the sort of movie that leaves you wondering what in the world the filmmakers thought they were doing, because nothing about the movie works in any way.<br/><br/>Adapted from a Stephen King novella, The Mist tells the story of the residents of a small Maine town that are trapped inside a supermarket when a strange mist rolls in. The mist brings with it bizarre monsters that kill anyone who goes outside, while inside the supermarket a thoroughly hateful woman begins whipping people up into a murderous, religious frenzy in that face of what she thinks is a Biblical apocalypse. Eventually, a small group of people secretly plan to flee the supermarket, preferring to face whatever is in the mist instead of their fearful and violent fellow human beings.<br/><br/>And that's about it. I realize that doesn't seem like such a terrible plot, but that's really all that happens in a movie that lasts just over 2 hours. There are a lot of pointless, useless scenes that do nothing but kill time in place of actually telling a story. The plot is very much structured like a fast-paced horror-thriller with the characters being quickly moved into position and the threat being established. But then, writer/directed Frank Darabont slooooows everything down and streeeeeetches everything out so he can pontificate on how religious dogma is merely a cover for the basest human emotions of fear and hate.<br/><br/>As bad as that sounds, what's even worse is that Darabont can't even pontificate well. This is a horribly written film, where moral and ethical dilemmas are set up in the most simplistic of ways and where characters not only explain to you what's going on but also detail exactly what it's supposed to mean. There's never a moment when the religious woman isn't plainly evil and what she's doing isn't clearly wrong. Which would be fine if this was trying to be a roller-coaster ride that isn't mean to be taken seriously. But Darabont very distinctly want the audience to take everything he's doing seriously because he thinks he has something important to say. The only thing this movie says, however, is ""Frank Darabont is not as smart as he thinks he is"".<br/><br/>That's demonstrated by the fact that there's never any alternative established to the religion that Darabont evidently abhors. Logic and reason aren't that alternative, because the character in the movie that most embodies those traits is a raging jackass who is irrationally skeptical to suicidal extremes. Nothing defines the small group that opposes the religious madness inside the supermarket except the fact they don't get swept up in it. But there's never any reason given or shown for to explain why. Without offering some course to be taken, some other creed to believe, Darabont's effort at righteous thunder feels more like petulant whining.<br/><br/>None of the characters in this thing ever act, feel or sound like real people. They're just very dumb nails in service to The Almighty Plot Hammer. Now, the actors all do fairly decent work. Marcia Gay Harden is suitably vile as the religious fanatic who stirs everyone up and Thomas Jane plays the everyman hero quite well. But all of these characters are so cramped and contrived that none of the actors have a chance to shine or even breathe. Take Thomas Jane's hero. There's nothing particularly heroic about him and there's never any reason given for why he's the hero of the story. He just is.<br/><br/>And then there's the ending. Oh, boy! This film has one of the most insulting and infuriating endings I've ever seen and I don't mean that in a good way. Sometimes an ending can shock and disturb you because you're caught up in the story and the conclusion punches you in the heart and leaves you stunned. The ending to The Mist will leave you stunned, but at who the hell ever thought this ending was a good idea. It's not just unbelievably idiotic, it's one of those endings that invalidates the story you've just watched and leaves you wondering what the point of watching it was. It's the sort of casual nihilism that marks an immature heart and spirit.<br/><br/>The Mist is a cinematic failure in almost every way. Even for a Stephen King adaptation, it's notably bad, which is saying a lot. Avoid this movie like it really was a mist filled with flesh-tearing beasts."

","I'm going to warn everyone that the grade I gave this movie is based off one thing and one thing only: The ending. I loved the whole of this movie up until the end of it.<br/><br/>The acting: A bit flat at points, but overall believable when it really counts.<br/><br/>Visuals: The CG monsters might have been a bit amateurish to start, but it's easy to overlook Plot: Based on the Stephen King book of the same name, so you know it's a solid plot based off of the human's darker nature coming out as much as the monster.<br/><br/>But the ending? That's the main issue I have with this movie. It's traditional survival horror, and the heroes represent the will to survive. All until the last five minutes when SPOILER ALERT! <br/><br/>The main character kills everyone he's managed to save because they can't find a way out of the mist. He then tries to kill himself.<br/><br/>SPOILER DONE.<br/><br/>Worst ending ever. It completely negates what the rest of the movie was about and ruins the rest of the film.<br/><br/>My advise: If you do go see this movie, do yourself a favor and leave about ten minutes before it's supposed to end. You'll feel a lot better about it, trust me. That, or just skip seeing it in theaters and wait for the DVD with the ""Original Novella Ending"" to be released."

"onelegobuilder","9","1","9","23 November 2007"," A Mist-erious and scary thrill ride 9/10
","-Warning: DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE FILM!!!- <br/><br/>""The Mist"" is the best horror film since ""Saw."" It delivers scares, laughs and cheers. Yes cheers. Everyone in the audience cheered when the female villain met her demise in the film. A group of people seek shelter inside a grocery store when an eerie mist surrounds the area. Then without warning ferocious creatures from another world come to devour people. when the audience is caught off guard, tentacles appear, followed by large insects, arachnids, and pterodactyl-like creatures. They don't go much into detail as to where these creatures came from, but no need to, because the story centers around the refugees. <br/><br/>If you believe ""The Mist"" is a rip-off of ""The Fog"" you are badly mistaken. This horror film based on a story by Stephen King, is suspenseful and full of impressive special effects. Plus the film doesn't feel long, like Director Frank Darabont's 3 hour film ""The Green Mile."" It's at a good pace with occasional fade ins and outs to give the story an episodic feel. <br/><br/>I give this film 9/10 because it was superbly written, directed, and acted. The only reason why it doesn't get 10 is, well, most horror films deserve a sad ending. But Darabont somewhat goofed when it came to credibility. Which is kind of what brought down ""Children of Men"" from being a flawless movie because of the ending. Most of the survivors die at the end only two minutes before help arrives and the mist clears away instantly. Plus it was also out-of-character for some people acted differently in intense situations. If only that help arrived earlier there would be more survivors. Oh well. While some classics like ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""28 Days later,"" were wise to cut out their original endings. ""The Mist"" is still a horror film that will be remembered years from now as a scary film with big-budgeted special effects and a clever character study of the grocery store survivors."

","Very well written & made for the screen from one of the best stories of Stephen King's ""horror"" stuff. Frank Darabont does with Mr King's horror story the same as he did for SKing's non-horror story The Shawshank Redemption & that is gives it justice. The new ending of David killing everyone is really the only change & then minutes after while awaiting one of The Mist's beasts to come & eat him he sees a military truck roll in. He realizes he's just killed everyone & now their being rescued.He goes mad with anguish. To top if off he sees the woman he leaves the store & goes out into the Mist, cause she left he kids alone to run to the stone in the back of the truck of the rescued & she glares at him hatefully was even more thought-provoking. Thomas Jane was great as the main character David & Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as the religious freak villianess Mrs Carmody. Great special effects from Berger & Nicotero & this is of his horror stuff my favorite King adapted horror film so far. But how did the military fix it is what i want to know?That is never explained.

"loutorres-88970","8","0","2","6 May 2018"," The real evil is inside
","The 2007 film The Mist directed by Frank Darabont based on the novel by Stephen King 
is a very underrated film that deserves much more attention. The story centers around a group of 
people trapped inside of a grocery store when a large unknown mist engulfs the entire town. As 
the characters in the grocery store are slowly introduced, they soon discover that the mist 
contains weird unknown creatures. The irony in this film is not that there are creatures 
surrounding the grocery store and the characters are basically trapped. It is mainly about how a 
life threatening disaster and struggle for survival can bring out the best and worst in people. 
From watching the film many times throughout my life I have finally figured out the true 
meaning behind it. The mist and the creatures that inhabit it are not the point in this film, it is the 
characters and their choices that they make throughout the film that impact it the most. Frank 
Darabont does an extraordinary job of bringing out the struggle for survival amongst the 
characters in the store without over dramatizing it. The real villain in the movie is not the 
creatures in the mist but a religious fanatic named Mrs.Carmundy played by Marcia Gay 
Harden. As the movie goes on and the inhabitants of the store begin to witness the full extent of 
the mist,Carmundy acquires a following claiming that humanity is being punished by god. This 
in itself proves that ignorance and fear lead to stupidity which is a direct reference to modern day 
issues. Overall the film is very well executed and directed. There is no over the top acting and 
never a dull moment. There are a couple of shots in the film where the cgi is a little bit dated, but 
does not ruin the film. I would argue the mist is more of a drama than an actual horror film. The 
mist and the creatures serve as a mere backdrop to the real evil inside of the grocery store, and 
that is what makes the film so great."

","The Mist film review (8/10) "" Great emotions, good effects but a little long and dull at times"". <br/><br/>The Mist is a 2007 sci-fi horror film. In my opinion it is an average horror but better as a sci-fi as it is believable, yet not consistently scary. <br/><br/>Plot <br/><br/>The plot was a basic concept but well executed to emphasise emotions and feelings, whilst maintaining tension. It was fairly consistent throughout, but enough variation in the setting, was applied to maintain interest throughout most of the movie. Themes such as racism and religion were carefully employed and likened to society of today. The people in their actions seemed to effectively mimic reality, keeping things believable in a surreal scenario. <br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>Music was absent for most of the movie. The quiet allowed emotive words to have real impact though, and the acting to be carefully observed. It was used well for eerie scenes, and seemingly impossible events were backed up with religious music. Overall the music complemented the themes of the film well. <br/><br/>Setting and effects <br/><br/>The setting was an everyday mundane location, making the events unfolding unexpected. This acted as a good surprise hook to entice the viewer to keep with the film, following the introduction. As time went on the setting became more consistent yet the strength of characters kept things interesting enough to prevent boredom. <br/><br/>The horror was a little too limited at times however, bearing in mind the setting and long movie length. It perhaps needed a little more shock value in places. Particularly around the 1 hour mark, I found this to be the case. <br/><br/>The effects for a 2007 film seemed very well done and for some peculiar life forms this did indeed feel as realistic as possible. The setting was used well to play on emotions and relationships. It also gave a sense of tension. It didn't merit the 2-hour movie duration however, which was why certain parts felt a little dull. <br/><br/>Emotions were not especially effective when people were busy, and seemed to die off at times. In times of tension however, or greater excitement, the emotions also became more believable. The movie ended in a slightly predictable fashion, although the strength of emotion made this really heart- felt which left me feeling that the film was definitely worth the watch. <br/><br/>Summary 
I would recommend watching this film as a mixture of horror, sci-fi, and almost reality drama in a way. For the film however, the duration was too long and the enemies a little sparse. Certain parts needed greater excitement and more emotion. Overall this was exciting though, and capable of keeping an interested viewer throughout."

","If you've ever played ""the floor is lava"" game when you were a kid, then the concept of this movie will be very familiar to you. Don't go into the mist. The ambiguity of ""the mist"" and what it is, and the sense of being locked inside, are the highlights of this work of fiction. And definitely strikes the right kinds of fear in the audience, and draws interest to how this diverse group of people, will deal with this unexplained and unknown danger. You can tell that every cast member has put their best skills into this. Starting with Thomas Jane in the role of a fearful father, trying to protect his only son, and Marcia Harden, trying to, do what she does. <br/><br/>There are two things which have (in my opinion) made this movie far less interesting to watch, and not exploit this awesome idea to its fullest potential. The first thing being cinematography, which i think is to blame for every line that seems like a cliché, and every shot that feels like composition 101. And I'm not even talking about graphics. which is ""a pinch over acceptable"", and truly suits a B movie. The second thing is the ""science vs religion"" thing, which this movie gradually develops into. It's a big distraction from the real problem and draws the focus towards what's inside, as opposed to the actual problem of what's outside.

"roblesar99","7","0","1","8 August 2017"," Darabont Loses Some of The Film's Potential In the Titular Mist...
","Writer-director Frank Darabont's The Mist is a film I wanted to like a lot more than I ended up liking. This is, after all, another Stephen King adaptation from the same director who brought to the screen the greatest King adaptation of all, The Shawshank Redemption (it edges The Shining by a hair.) But instead, I was left with a certain feeling of dissatisfaction when the credits started rolling, a feeling that was likely compounded by the film's absolute sucker punch of an ending. The film follows a group of individuals taking refuge in a grocery store after an unnatural mist covers the town after a violent thunderstorm the night prior. Inside the mist, hide supernatural monsters that threaten the residents' existence. King used the original story to tell a story about human beings in the face of extreme odds, a concept that Darabont entertains to generally successful results. There's a lot to admire here, but there's also a handful of flaws that hold it back from reaching greatness.<br/><br/>For one, Thomas Jane feels miscast as the film's protagonist, David Drayton, a freelance artist. In fact, he almost single-handedly ruins the film's ending because he makes it nearly impossible to take him seriously. The misfire of his casting stands out both because of his somewhat wooden performance and for the simple reason that everyone else in the cast fits their role like a glove. Marcia Gay Harden delivers an excellent performance as Mrs. Carmody, a fanatical Christian who believes that the mist signifies the coming of the apocalypse. Playing the film's despicable antagonist, Harden delivers stellar work, demonstrating that sometimes the real monster isn't lurking around in the shadows, but rather standing right next to you. Toby Jones also turns in a solid performance as Ollie Weeks, the assistant manager of the store, gradually transforming from a seemingly meek individual to one of Drayton's essential allies as the rift between Drayton's group and Carmody's followers grows. Even Laurie Holden, who has often been slighted for her role as Andrea in AMC's The Walking Dead manages to deliver. Playing Amanda Dumfries, an elementary school teacher, Holden makes the most of her somewhat limited material. Apart from Drayton, the rest of these characters lack depth, but the performers make for a saving grace.<br/><br/>The film does tackle some thought-provoking ideas and themes, examining the way human beings react to extreme situations. Considering the film's release a decade ago, Darabont prominently focuses on the rift that forms between the aforementioned groups, which serves as an obvious parallel for the Bush-era conflict between Christian, right-wing thinking and more secular, left-wing ideology. While it wouldn't have hurt to portray the groups with a bit more nuance (the division between the two becomes entirely too clear), Darabont deserves credit for his willingness to make a horror film with more than just scares on its mind. But as for the horror, that's where Darabont's film excels. There are genuine moments of dread and terror throughout, as the groups in the supermarket deal with both the creatures of the mist and themselves. And Darabont accomplishes this by establishing a convincingly ominous atmosphere rather than relying on jump scares. The film feels like a monster movie from the '50s, and I really wish I could have been able to watch the B&W version.<br/><br/>However, Darabont's writing falters when compared to his directing. About halfway through the film, a romance scene occurred between two minor characters that felt incredibly jarring considering that the majority of the film had focused on Drayton up to that point. Furthermore, the next time we see these characters, one of them immediately dies at the hands of the creatures, as Darabont seems to believe that a shoehorned romance scene mere moments prior will be enough to raise the emotional stakes of their death. It just doesn't work though and feels more like lazy storytelling than anything else. Now I can't comment on how much development King's original novella offers for these two characters, but considering Darabont's willingness to tweak the ending, he could have fleshed out the relationships between these characters more. And as for that ending, I can't say that I necessarily agree with it. Darabont's conclusion delves into far darker territory than that of the novella's, creating a genuinely shocking moment. I do appreciate that he didn't deliver a forced happy ending. But his ending, one so ruthlessly bleak and nihilistic, probably should have been scrapped in favor of the ambiguity that the original ending provides.<br/><br/>I wish that I hadn't been left slightly disappointed by The Mist. While there's plenty to enjoy, from the taut scares to the retro '50s vibe and the generally solid performances, storytelling problems and the soul-crushing ending hold it back from entering the upper echelon of King adaptations.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 (Good)"
"newblu","8","0","2","9 July 2017"," Peep This Reviews
","Director Frank Darabont had previously adapted two classic Stephen King tales into unforgettable films. One of which is heralded as one of the best movies ever made. Ever. So he goes to tap that well of Stephen King's material once again. He decides to venture out of the setting of period prison films into something that would be considered a more typical horror movie. A mist full of deadly creatures trap a group of people in a prison that's taken the shape of a supermarket. Tempers flair, people butt heads and a gripping story begins to unfold which has an ending that is radically different from it's source material but in King's own words is better than what he had originally written. How often does an author say that about an adaptation of his/her work. Um...never. Great film and worth watching in full color and in black and white as it was originally conceived."

","This film is a straight up masterpiece. I think brainless criticism for this film comes from the fact this is horror film and as well as a King novel adaptation. People always scoff at King because he has his fingerprints all over cinema. There is a reason why King is tapped as much as he is, and this film is a small example why. The story is simple enough but layered and slowly explodes into a tour de force. The film is creepy, upsetting and truly scary without the need of jump-scares. But everyone always talks about the ending of the film, and for good reason too. However, the ending of the film would be worthless if it wasn't for the masterful pacing and storytelling. Yeah, this is shamelessly underrated."

","From the director of The Shawshank Redemption & The Green Mile comes another adaptation of a Stephen King's novel, this time exploring the horrors that people are capable of inflicting on others when their primal instincts are driven by the fear of the unknown. Engulfed in a thick layer of mist, what we have here is a monster flick that's thrilling, suspenseful & looming with paranoia and also works as an apt examination of human condition.<br/><br/>The Mist concerns a small town community that gathers at the local supermarket to pick supplies, following a night of violent thunderstorm, but when their entire town is enveloped by an unnatural mist that's apparently hiding otherworldly creatures, they find themselves stuck at the store for an indefinite period and attempt to survive the apocalyptic disaster together. But tension soon arises within the horrified & distraught members of the community.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Frank Darabont, The Mist doesn't take long to move on with its main plot as within minutes into the story, we find the entire town being enveloped in a thick mist which brings an aura of mystery along with the monsters and instantly establishes a suspenseful atmosphere as well. However, Darabont's real strength lies in exploring our basic instincts and he demonstrates exactly that with alarming trueness while handling the genre conventions side by side.<br/><br/>The film packs an adequate amount of monster action but it is at its most effective when dealing with the distinct personalities that inhabit this feature. A chilling sense of dread permeates each n every frame, and it remains a tense affair till the very end, where it culminates on a far darker note than anticipated. Sure, it doesn't shy away from revelling in little bloodshed & gore every now n then but its main emphasis is on keeping its foreboding ambiance alive, at which it brilliantly triumphs.<br/><br/>The majority of its plot unfolds in a single location, bringing the claustrophobia element into play, while creatures of all shapes & sizes keep surfacing at regular intervals to remind us of the peril that's waiting outside. Also contributing to the overall experience is its steady camera-work, firm editing & its nearly absent soundtrack that makes its presence felt only during the final moments, thus enhancing the jolt of its climax by a further few notches. But there are also a few misses.<br/><br/>The visual effects is terrible when it comes to monsters' designs & appearance. It looks a tad too cartoonish to be taken seriously, and never seamlessly blends with the imagery. However, it does work when all we could see is their silhouettes. Performances aren't that compelling either as the cast fails to capitalise on the terrific work Darabont has done with the scripted characters. Their input isn't disappointing nor does it take away anything from the picture but it could've been so much more.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Mist is another expertly crafted, smartly narrated & thoroughly engrossing cinema from Frank Darabont that may not touch the heights of his finest efforts but it still works as an interesting meditation on human nature. Beautifully illustrating just how quickly rational thinking goes out the window when people are placed in overwhelming situations, and how easily fear & panic can turn even the most civilised society into a mindless mob, The Mist is dense with themes, focuses more on the evil that resides within us, and cuts deeper than your average monster flick. Worth a shot."
"smatysia","6","0","2","24 December 2015"," Basically an okay horror flick
","Well, the last ten comments are all over the map. I come down in the middle. I did read the Stephen King novella, which is the source material for this film, many years ago. It was gripping, like all of his work, whether you are into the horror genre or not. The biggest difference, aside from the ending, is that in the King work, the characters never see whatever is in the mist, only the results. The mist is otherworldly thick and opaque, more than just thick fog. And they never get the slightest clue as to where it came from. As far as this film, there were some excellent acting performances by Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden. Also by Marcia Gay Harden in a role that Ebert called ""unplayable"". The film could have benefited a lot with a better actor than Thomas Jane playing the lead. It is basically an okay horror flick, but, as usual, not nearly as good as the King story it is based on, which I realize is not always a fair criticism comparing separate media. The ending is quite powerful."

","The story was OK but there were so many errors and cliché characters that it was a tough watch for me. First, this is supposed to be a contemporary story, yet the military police vehicle and uniform is from the 1970's. Additionally, MP's are not sent out into the public to track down privates to tell them that their leave has been canceled. I also could not figure out why the privates were wearing Class A dress uniforms to a grocery store. The religious doom sayer character (Marcia Gay Harden) was just laughable. There were also several scenes that were supposed to create a sense of tension but I also found those to be more funny or implausible. The creatures were very poorly animated and came off more like a low budget 70's drive in movie than a $18 million horror. I think the flaw in this film is the script and the director. Both did not do King's book any justice."
"jwfritz","3","0","4","4 July 2015"," Decent enough movie, Terrible ending.
","The pacing was OK. Much of the action centered around a relatively small area of location. It had a lot of the usual clichés often seen in such horror movies of a likewise nature such as zombie, or apocalypse, or general unknown versus man type themes. The sense of mystery develops pretty early into the story and has a few key cues to emphasize a sense of danger. <br/><br/>It resembles quite closely the nature and pacing of the Fog but reflects a atypical zombie apocalypse movie in the nature of how the characters are located and behave. The impending sense of doom and the sheer mass nature of the threat also add to that vibe. <br/><br/>***SPOILER*** What sucks most about the movie is the horrible ending. It is not just the ending is such a let down but the way the story develops up until the end should have deserved a much different ending. The main character especially and secondly the other characters featured in the last few scenes present the viewer with a ""do not give up"" easily mentality yet, we what we are shown is far from what we expected in regards to the character and that attitude constantly demonstrated throughout the movie. It is emphasized even more a few minutes after that critical yet flawed decision. The best scene is when the cultist nut job leader mets her just desserts but, it would have been nice if all the nut jobs in her gang also got a fitting punishment for their evil actions. So, as a viewer I feel let down twice in big ways and thus quite unfulfilled. <br/><br/>The enemies resemble a cross between Deep Rising, Monster, Starship Troopers, and some of the creatures seen in the British TV series, Primevil. Yet in a sense they lacked consistency and though in some ways that added to the unknown sense of fear in other ways it made it seem as if there was no concrete plan or nature to the enemies. If you like being filled in by the end of a story, then this movie is not for you. There are too many unknown variables by the movie's end to get a good grip on. It would have been nice to understand the nature of the mist. Was it a new alien environment or some poison gas or was it just colored smoke natural to Earth? The previous two, we would expect more reaction by the humans or a more cataclysmic event affecting the Earth and its atmosphere. Creatures like that can not exist in the human world based on what it appears to be which are mostly types of insects. There is not enough oxygen in the air for that. If that had been made a little more clear with respect to the nature of the mist and/or more about the world the creatures come from, then viewers would not feel like they are hanging as much. No one I know who watched this liked the ending either. And I am pretty sure they were also a bit left in the dark about what the enemy was.<br/><br/>***SPOILER END***<br/><br/>It is not a bad thing to have some mystery or even leave a few things unanswered but it feels like though the setting is certainly a good premise that it leaves too many open ends to delve into the story. It is a reflection of the rushed stories we often find in anime, where often when watching many a anime, I feel like I walked into the middle of a story with no idea how I got there. Granted, it doesn't quite feel like the story is in the middle at the start but, it doesn't quite feel ready to jump to where it does later on either based on the setting.<br/><br/>For the most part, it is a we'll enough paced movie with a good premise, but it feels like something is missing and that by the close of the movie I feel let down. It doesn't close with nearly the same impact as the story as a whole nor as it unfolds. The acting starts off well enough but later it feels a bit rushed. A few times it resembles Star Trek in the sense of the red shirts. Some parts are so pointless, it makes you want to roll your eyes. There are highlights that make me think of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13, the original one. Then there are moments right out of the worst parts of the lamest zombie movies. I can not give this a strong review because what is wrong and missing are too heavy to overlook or forgive what is expected from Stephen King or those who adapt his works."
"tommoben97","6","0","2","19 January 2015"," So Close
","Now, I know this review will be lost in the extraordinarily large number already given, however, I want to warn you before you read into this. This film is good but you don't want to watch it just before you go to bed. You will likely be kept awake for a while thinking on human stupidity, and maybe the movie as well.<br/><br/>***From this point on there WILL be spoilers. This is a review, not an opinion, (Though I think that slipped a little.)***<br/><br/>'The Mist' is a good film, yet like many before it's fatal flaws dig into me as a viewer. Primarily the characters. When I watch a movie I want to be drawn into it's world. ""I want believe."" When elements like such as wooden characters and stubborn script writing pull me out of the rabbit hole, I don't tend to be all that happy with it. But, for any critique I can place on it, I would prefer to say the good things first. <br/><br/>The first half hour was near perfect. A small neighbour-based dilemma and some terrific tension building. I enjoy a leadership powerfully in a survival situation, which is what this film is entirely based around for and hour and 55 minutes. Yes, that leaves the last 5 in a two hour horror story.<br/><br/>When it gets into it's defense phase of the story, it was awesome. The CGI was actually pretty good, not I would expect any less. Violent death ensues throughout the film as one would expect. It even did something few movies do that others may only hint at. It offers some answers and keeps then moderately vague. The sci-fi element was great. The social commentary was, I believe, pretty accurate. You may believe what you will but I feel that in an unknown crisis people will do what they did and start to get primitive and sacrificial. <br/><br/>That, I'm afraid, is where the realistic approach to an unrealistic situation ends. In this film there are two major downfalls: character reactions and the ending, which is also an unrealistic reaction to a situation. In every situation the characters are tossed head first into, they do two things. The first, they scream. OK. Alright. Horror movie. Screaming? Covered. The second being that they don't run from creatures far superior to mop handles. A dude loses a chunk of leg and dies. Another gets face melted and eaten. Fine, but why did this happen? Because they tried to use 12 bullets, an absurdly blunt fire axe and sticks to fight when there was clearly no point. Why didn't they run? Oh, right, it's just a movie. <br/><br/>When someone like me sees a flaw and the only real explanation is, ""it's just a movie,"" then something somewhere has gone terribly wrong. Probably the script. Yeah, it's the script. So this guy, this group of seemingly level headed morons are allowed to gawk at a dude with alien bugs in him, (thanks, 'Alien', we owe you one) but there is no excuse to getting two people killed for a dumb engagement. Run! No one will blame you.<br/><br/>When the religious madwoman manages to conjure up a following of everyone but eight supposedly smart people and a kid until they sacrifice an innocent guy and demand they kill the kid, and the ""whore"", and then all of the 'willful' people, the eight leave. They hop in a car, losing four more. They drive away to some LOTR style epic/dramatic music. Everything's all cool. They even see a creature like the ones Godzilla had to fight in 2014... Huh. Then they run out of juice. Lo and behold, four bullets are left in the gun.<br/><br/>The last four (plus one child) decide instantly to kill themselves. Huh. I thought these were the willful, stand up to the religious guys. There was no, ""Oh, should we fight, go it on foot, or should we, the smart ones, just give it all up and kill ourselves, cause that's the smart thing to do that goes against the whole law of nature. You know, that one about survival of the fittest even though we are the fittest of them all?"" No, just, ""Gun? Coo. Let's all die. Rather than lining a pair of heads so the main character whose name we've all forgotten can also die before the tanks come around and the mist magically vanishes."" That's their first thought. Just give up. Fine, try for an ending like 'The Thing' in the dumbest way possible. Sure, they couldn't get away that made sense. This was JUST ******* DUMB. I can't begin to describe how much that ending made me hate the rest of movie.<br/><br/>But I digress. This is what I think the conclusion is meant to sound like: This is a good movie will science fiction elements, well made CGI and some genuine horror for some people. However, it's predictable,painful to watch at times and suffers from dull characters who barely seem to know right from, judging by the way no one seems to know where the exits are to run. While some may benefit from their endeavour to watch this film, others among you will despise it. I give it an 'A' for effort, 'B' for CGI, 'C' for the poor acting of some of the extras and even some of the secondary cast and a solid 'D' for displaying backwards human reactions to clearly hopeless fights. Defending the store was fine when there was no where to run, but otherwise poor effort. They really didn't care about and organised defense, did they? Oh well, religious nuts will be religious nuts when they aren't gagged to prevent idiocy and blind faith in what seem to be empty human shaped shells waiting to be filled with bible references. And a 'B-' for social commentary."

","The proved Frank Darabont/Stephen King writing team shines through yet again. With hits like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile achieved I expected a lot from this despite its pitiful budget and very short filming schedule. I'm pleased to say I was in no way disappointed. The casting is spot on - for fans of the genre you will recognise quite a few regulars from the walking dead making appearances. All parts are extremely well acted and there are no irritating/unnecessary characters. Whilst first and foremost this is a science fiction horror what Darabont/King do best is portraying the human element to these situations. I mean after all if people don't react realistically to fake monsters movies can very quickly look ridiculous and laughable. The terror portrayed by the lead characters and supporting cast really puts you on edge and the tension doesn't let up until the credits start rolling. Some of the most chilling moments are the parts where the writers show human beings to be fearful, aggressive, fickle and losing all sense of morality and evidence of civilisation when put in a situation with no familiar modern infrastructure. I guess I should mention the creatures themselves. They are for the most part pretty terrifying. In the same vein as 'Jaws' the less you see the scarier the evil is for the viewer. They are only revealed at key moments and inspire all the things that make your skin crawl. I won't tell you what happens but my god what an ending. I think this is probably the most disturbing ending to a movie I've ever seen. Very very thought provoking and it does really get to you. This is a really fantastic horror and for fans of movies like Cameron's Aliens and Predator you will not be disappointed. Great movie, still stands up in 2014."

","I've been putting off reviewing films for a while for several reasons. But this title, 'The Mist', has sparked something inside of me. This film is neither good, nor bad, and if I were looking at it from a normal perspective, then I would admit that it's a pretty average horror flick. But it's important to stay true to your values, and I've always said: ""If a film can make me feel something foreign, or even something normal, but to an extreme... then it must have some good, if not great, qualities."" The acting was not to a 'Good Will Hunting' standard, and the direction was in typical Darabont style, (not that there's anything wrong with that). But overall, the thing that I will remember most from this film, is the anger that it filled me with in certain parts. It scarred my mind and re-instilled previous internal complications I've had with some of the subject matter.<br/><br/>I know this isn't a typical review and may not offer much in the way of choosing a movie for the night; but all I can say is that: this is not a fantastic movie, and it's far from one of my favourites, but it has left me a lot to think about, so go in with an open mind to a film that's easy to watch with a closed one, and consider the subtle - and not-so-subtle - points that Frank Darabont makes about society, religion, politics and general human nature."

","(59%) A very watchable horror set mostly around a single location that for the most part works well. The all too clear politics involving race, class, and in particular religion are fleshed out in a typical supermarket setting acting as the characters only line of defence, as well as a platform to host their opinion and influence those around them. My biggest issue here comes quite close to almost ruining the movie, that being the mumbling performances from a majority of the cast between the more dramatic sequences. I have perfect hearing, but I struggled to register the numerous quiet moments almost as if the script had something to hide, and those scenes (from what I could hear) were indeed mostly filler so I suspect a bit of corner cutting behind the scenes was going on, which is a shame. The ending is a bit overly drastic, but overall the movie is entertaining and enjoyable enough for a watch."

","'The Mist' (2007) was directed by Frank Darabont and is based off a short story of the same name by Stephen King which can be found in the collection 'Skeleton Crew'.<br/><br/>It's about a bunch of people who get trapped in a supermarket by a mist containing deadly creatures that rips anyone who goes outside to shreds. It's also about how the people in the supermarket are affected by this. Different people respond in different ways. People are distressed and becoming frequently more irrational as the film progresses. There's the main character, David Drayton, who's the calm and rational person who's trying to do the right thing. There's also a crazy religious woman reminiscent of the mother in 'Carrie'. She riles things up by trying to convince everyone that this is an act of a vengeful God. She becomes crazier as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The monsters look obviously computer generated, therefor not as convincing as I would've liked, however, they would've looked amazing if they'd looked realistic. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. There's even a scene which plays on our common phobia of creepy-crawlies.<br/><br/>'The Mist' is a tense and riveting suspense thriller with vivid characters and despite an impending sense of dread manages to be scattered with funny moments throughout.<br/><br/>The biggest punch of all is in the ending, which is one of the most brutally bleak endings I've seen, partly because it's so unexpected and comes as a visceral shock to the viewer. If they had all been killed by the mist, it would've seemed almost happy in comparison. Though the ending made a huge impression on me, it left me with a bad taste and is not an ending one wishes to linger in the imagination.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great, adding to the film where needs be. At the end, it uses a song called 'The Host of Seraphim' by 'Dead Can Dance', which makes its tragic ending all the more haunting."

","Typical of Stephen King movies, there is just a bit too much dialog. The special effects are very realistic and convincing, considering they are unknown creatures, presumably from space...or from...??? For a movie to have a good script rating, it should be as logical as possible. The Matrix and the Inception are 2 movies that are far- fetched but very logical. That is what makes them as great as their special effects which ooh the viewer, and it is the logical script that holds one's interest. So, this is where The Mist fails and gets a D-. If a handful of men during a deadly shooting, for example, ask you to come look at the crime scene, it is not logical that you would suspect all of them of playing a trick on you. This is not a party event. There is a also a scene where a group is asked to do the unthinkable and illogical in a killing. And the ending makes me sick because it is so very, very stupid logically. When you watch it, you will see that a very intelligent man not only cannot count if his life depended on it, but his decision initially is absolutely absurd.

OK its fiction, but when it is so unreal, it gets more the shapes of comics, falling into a grotesque result. exactly like the acting main form. <br/><br/>So i don't know what genial mind is behind this, who drew the monsters, who wrote the stenography (sounds very much copied by Romero's zombie movie when they are trapped into a mall, now that is a horror movie!), but they are all linked by this sort of really really annoying over exaggerating: in the acting, in the feelings bad express by indeed the acting, so even the feelings get to be grotesque, even if at first, may be sharable (everybody would be scared in such a situation, but due to the also unreal, prone to comics, again grotesque, shape of the monster, we do not see ourselves in such a situation, too wrongly unreal, too grotesque, as i said:id rather play with them rather than fight them, at first glance), in the monsters, even the final was so trivial, obvious and foreseeable. and what surprises me the most is that the director directer 2 amazing movies, they are amongst my fa vs, on the top 10: the thing redemption and the green mile. so horror is probably not his field or that time he had something else in his mind. anyway surely he wasn't surrounded by valid collaborators, because if i was there, i would have told him: what the f*@ are you doing?? now relax, sit on the director's chair (that classic one with director on it) take some beer, even smoke something, and let me clear up this mess and let's get to some good insight and thus result...no really.y this movie is an insult to cinema, to acting, and to his to previous masterpieces (for me they indeed are), they are an insult to his mind. of course this movie doesn't change the esteem i have for him, and the great app reaction and really deep love for those 2 movies, but this ""movie"" is clearly an insult to them. this movie's film should be burned, and the movie deleted from the web and from our minds,with the MIB machine: OK, now look at this light: you never watched this movie, this movie never existed. we would do a favor ourselves and to him. for head be remembered only for those 2 movies, not something like this, anyway i remember him for those 2, but well whatever about this, as i said, ill just think that period he had something else, or anyway his reasons to do this...cheers"
"morkulv_athferion","5","0","2","28 February 2014"," Not that great. Your average horror pulp
","It seems people are trying to give The Mist some sort of cult-status as a great horror movie these days (I've seen this movie pop up on several people's lists of 'best horror movies of all time'). To tell you the truth, this is nowhere near one of the greatest horror movies of all time. I wouldn't even call this the best Steven King movie of all time.<br/><br/>The plot is not that special, but it works. It's actually the lack of story that this movie has going for it in its favor. A town gets enveloped in a thick mist, people start disappearing and monsters show up. It's good that the filmmakers kept it relatively open, as to where or what caused the mist (and in return, the monsters) to appear. This way the script isn't forcefully spoon feeding the audience a story, but rather putting them in the situation, which is something I like in a movie.<br/><br/>So that's basically the good points out of the way. Let me list some of the things that irked me the most about The Mist; first off is the acting. The leading roles are not portrayed that well. The performances mostly come off as stiff, and it hurts the movie's atmosphere. I do have to say though that some of the side characters were done well.<br/><br/>Second are the special effects. Listen, I have no trouble with CGI monster designs as long as they are done well. A lot of the time in movies (although as of 2014, CGI has thankfully progressed a lot) the computer generated creature designs look like they are made of plastic, or are animated in such a way that makes them appear unrealistic. The Mist is no different in this regard: The monster designs don't look good for the type of atmosphere the movie is trying to convey. If the filmmakers used something more subtle, and something that didn't look as conventional, it would have complimented the eerie setting way better.<br/><br/>The last thing, because I'd like to keep this short without dragging off: the ending. I know, it's a twist ending, and yes its kinda original. But that doesn't necessarily make it good. I can make music by farting on a trumpet. You could consider that original music, but it wouldn't necessarily be considered good. I say this because I've heard some people praise The Mist's ending as one of the most 'original' endings ever to a horror movie.<br/><br/>My reaction? I laughed. Yeah, I know it was supposed to be a sad / downbeat ending (I won't spoil it, don't worry), but honestly the first thing I thought when I watched the last scenes was this: ""Wouldn't it kinda suck if suddenly now... Oh! Well, what do you know!"". So yeah; this pretty much sums up what I think of the ending. It's original, definitely, but not exactly good because it really doesn't add that much more to the movie if you really think about it. They could have just ended the movie at the supermarket, or just after that. I know it wouldn't be as much of a ""OMFG TWIST ENDING!!!"" like it is now, but it would give the movie a lot more closure."

","I found this movie to be quite a bit exaggerated and some of the actors not to really live up to their part. The movies purpose was not clear. The script was pretty good, but it could have used a little improvement. I thought some of the monsters were well made but however the flying dinosaur like monster was not that impressive! In the end of the movie i was so disappointed, because five people that managed to escape from the store actually got trapped in a car, and the only was out for them was suicide. There were four bullets left and just slightly after one of them had to shoot the others the military came and rescued him. So if you want to see this movie and you don't know if you should then i can honestly say that you should not see it."
"daggersineyes","3","0","2","18 October 2013"," A depressing & inconsistent mess
","WARNING - This contains a lot of spoilers.<br/><br/>Having seen this movie recommended by several people on IMDb I thought this would be a sure winner - but how wrong I was. By 20 minutes into it I had already started fast forwarding, mostly due to the excruciatingly annoying and repetitious religious nut that the director saw fit to give a large percentage of screen time to. I get what he was trying to convey but we don't need multiple scenes of her irritating ranting for several minutes at a time to get the point. <br/><br/>I watch a movie to be entertained and enthralled or engaged not to listen to a lunatic constantly bashing people over the head with her sick hate-filled interpretation of the Bible. Almost half the screen time was given over to this character with nothing original or interesting about her dialogue and most of it just the same point being made over and over again. <br/><br/>Unfortunately there wasn't a whole lot to redeem the movie from this serious mis-step. Some of the special effects were good, other parts actually made me laugh they were so bad. I loved the giant bugs & their pterodactyl-like predators and would say that scene was the best part of the movie - possibly even the only part worth watching.<br/><br/>Apart from some contrived ""evil religious fanatics"" vs ""perfect everyday heroes"" scenarios and some nice shots of large scary insects who occasionally killed people, there isn't much else to see or recommend. The characters are all pretty much one-dimensional (either good/sane or bad/nutty as a fruit-cake) and the story itself really only needed 5 minutes to tell. There are a lot of overly melodramatic scenes with some really bad ham acting and terrible dialogue. The are many MANY puzzling scenes where something horrible is supposed to be happening but everyone is just standing around doing nothing and watching instead of, you know, killing the thing or even running away. There was one scene involving spiders where people were being so gormless & stupid I started rooting for the critters.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with The Mist though is the completely unrealistic attempt to portray the psychological ""melt down"" of the people in the supermarket. I understand folks get desperate when stressed/frightened etc and that would have been an interesting aspect to explore. But what they did with that concept was ridiculous and trivial. The sudden switch within just a day or so, from normal standard folk out shopping, to raving moronic idiots who believe the words of some clearly deranged, vicious religious nut and are happily ready to sacrifice children to a vengeful God (or rather - to a large octopus) stretched the bounds of credibility way too much. In fact, the concept of opening a portal to another world and letting in critters from outer space was actually more realistic than the way the people were portrayed in this movie. <br/><br/>And after suffering through this ridiculous, headache-inducing woman ranting and raving for an hour or so, we finally get to the end of the movie where the ""heroes"" make the most outrageously stupid decision imaginable just so the director can come up with an ending he thinks is clever and shocking. In reality the ending is nonsense. It makes no sense for them not to at least get out of the car and investigate to see if there's any other options available to them. Like - I dunno, siphoning petrol from or stealing an abandoned car or walking as far as they can to see if there's an end to the mist. The gun would have been a final desperate option when all else had failed and at that point there were still many other options available. I could think of at least a dozen more obvious and consistent actions they would have taken when the car ran out of petrol and as many better ways to end this movie. The one the Director went with was clearly just a cheap gimmick and an insult to the intelligence and good will of viewers.<br/><br/>Instead of feeling entertained/thrilled/shocked/scared the movie made me feel annoyed/irritated/bored/exasperated/disappointed and most of all - cheated.<br/><br/>This felt like some sort of extreme fanatical evangelist movie - in the end the religious extremists survive despite doing nothing to help others and being murderous child-killing cowards, while the people who did the most to help others and were sane, reasonable and took risks to save their fellow men & women - but did not join the ""cult"" - came out the losers. <br/><br/>Wouldn't recommend this flick to my worst enemy."

","About the only good thing I can say about this film is that there are some decent actors that deliver decent performances. Horrible CGI that looks like it was created on a made-for-TV budget, very few likable characters (understatement), characters whose actions are completely irrational and implausible, lame story with a minimal plot...I certainly hope the original story was better than this adaptation. I'm trying to keep this review to a minimum without including spoilers, as there are already plenty of reviews that cover that aspect, but IMDb requires reviews to be a minimum of ten lines. That being said, I'll add that I do personally think that Thomas Jane is a good actor, but that wasn't enough to save this film. I'll also add that I generally do not enjoy film adaptations of Stephen King's work. 10.5 lines. Ha!"
"Maziun","5","0","3","10 September 2013"," Nice , but fails half the way
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS It's third movie by Frank Darabont based on Stephen King book (The other are ""The Shawshank redemption"" and ""The Green mile""). It's the weakest of the three , but not necessarily because the book is not as great . No . The book itself was solid and it should been a solid movie. The problem is mainly with the adaptation.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good things . The movie works really well when it concentrates on the people in the shop. You could cut the tension with the knife. Also the first two meetings with the monsters are really scary. The overall acting is good. The big beast at the end is REALLY IMPRESSIVE.<br/><br/>OK , now the bad things. Thomas Jane is a weak actor and gives a poor performance. The CGI is very outdated . It looks incredibly bad , like from some cheap computer graphic program. I find it rather unbelievable that old religious fanatic who everybody treats as crazy woman takes over control in the shop so easily. And what's with Stephen King and his anti-Christian sentiments he likes to put in his books ? The movie also struggles to say some message . It wants to be anti-war , anti-religious , anti-capitalism all at once. In the end it's all muddled and unconvincing.<br/><br/>Darabont makes mistake by trying to scare the audience too hard. For example in the book the fact that the rope broke was scary enough. Here we also see blood and even a piece of body on the end of rope. In the later half of movie this over the top method of scaring audience becomes really annoying and kills all the thrills. It kinda turns the movie into a parody of itself.<br/><br/>The nail to the coffin is the ending. It was supposed to be terrifying and heartbreaking . It ends predictable , unintentionally laughable and stupid. How does that woman survived , when everyone else who left the shop was attacked and killed ? How is it possible that they didn't heard or saw the army tanks and trucks ? How the army was able to get there ? Shouldn't the beasts kill them ? Overall , it's not a bad movie , but it could have been so much better. I give it 5/10."

","These are my thoughts on ""The Mist"", I just saw it and I felt like I had to write something...<br/><br/>It's a descent movie except for two things:<br/><br/>The crazy Christian lady!! Oh my god! I have never in my life been so provoked by a character in a movie. I don't believe in any type of God so we were off to a bad start her and I. She kept getting more and more psycho and the people were blinded by her talk of religion and god almighty! Such a relief when she died, the bullet through her head was without a doubt the best part of the movie (ouch...).<br/><br/>With the crazy old lady gone I thought the worst part was over but I have never been more wrong in my life. <br/><br/>Please just watch the ending of the movie and decide for yourself whether you like it or not. Personally, it was the worst thing I've ever seen. How can you be so stupid and not wait until the last minute!? They were all in good condition, considering the circumstances. There was always a slight chance of the mist fading away or whatever but nope dad had to shoot his son in the head along with three other people. Woops... the military arrived seconds later...<br/><br/>Okay movie, worst ending.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading!"

It does have a good developing story and I did feel some connection to the characters... But that is about all the good I can say.<br/><br/>I take my movies seriously, I'm not one to laugh at a death or struggle of a character, but this movie had me laughing out loud, literally.<br/><br/>(Major Spoilers from here on)<br/><br/>There are several annoying characters that take the edge off of the movie, the story line pays too much attention to the crazy God lady (for some reason) that I just couldn't wait for her to be gone.<br/><br/>I felt no emotion for Billy Drayton (the child character) which is a much needed connection if a young boy character is involved in the movie. Even when he died in the end I just shrugged it off.<br/><br/>To top it off, we have Thomas Jane to provide us with the worst cry acting since Nicholas Cage.<br/><br/>I rated this Movie 4/10 because I'll give credit to the director for creating a strong build up to the main plot, but the other 6 stars I'm saving for a movie that manages to stop me checking my twitter every five minutes!"

","If you cut the movie down to 10 minutes the movie would be OK. Really, most of the film is totally predictable. You have seen this in 1000 variations since half a century (e.g. ""Blob"" and many other movies out of the 50ies). The characters are acting like those of the 50ties and are desperately untrustworthy given that it's playing in the 21th century. Watch the movie as a B-Movie, than it's really OK. It's kind of funny, but it takes itself too serious, so it left you feel rather annoyed. I am surprised that ""the Fog"" from Carpenter has got a badder rating than this crap. Warning!

","(Sorry for the title - I'm sure it's elsewhere here.) Maybe the saddest thing about this mess is that King supposedly loved it. There goes any hope of his being a victim of awful Hollywood. Anyway. The deal is, King is a talented hack. Which is fine; he has great moments and a lot of repetitive junk. But 'The Mist' was simply a fun, really good, scary story. The movie begins with potential, then screws up. BADLY. As noted here a lot, the religious frenzy was just too, too much. Even people that terrified would not so readily become mindless zombies, and this plot device drives, God help us, the second half of this too long film. Now, the ending - again, loved by SK. The problem isn't its darkness. The problem with it is its hopeless absence of any sense. OK, they're all in rough shape, but these are four smart people in the car. They know the area very well. They know that cars run out of gas. So, no one suggests heading to a shelter more secure than the supermarket? Or to a gun store (it's Maine, after all), or counting on the gun they have to buy the time needed to get gas? Tension and dread aside, it's insane to think that all of them would sit silently, banking only on enough fuel to get them out of the danger."

A better actor would have taken this film to a complete new level. Frank Darabont has done well as always. This movie runs through with very emotions. if you haven't watched it just go and buy a DVD . Most of the actors have done well. Some very good side kick performances.

","Fog was a much superior film, directed by John carpenter.<br/><br/>The Mist, at best merits about 1/2 hour in the Twilight Zone.<br/><br/>The Mist is created by some Army guys messing around with different dimensions resulting in a ""mist"" with giant bugs. The action centers around folks caught in a supermarket.<br/><br/>Far too much of the film is in the supermarket with inane dialog and a crazy fanatic bible thumper. It is supposed to represent ""the human condition"" but is totally predictable with all the people bitching a each other.<br/><br/>In reality, most folks come together in time of crisis and do not squabble over petty politics and polemics. Witness the floods in the mid west several years ago and how everyone helped everyone. Or witness the cooperative behavior of good folks during the tornadoes in southern Indiana last year.<br/><br/>Most crisis create cooperation not conflict.<br/><br/>The ""religiosity"" theme would have worked in the 50's but is lost in the modernity of the new millennium.<br/><br/>I can't believe that Darabont, who directed The Shawkshank Redemption, a truly great film, wasted his energy on this garbage. Yes the acting was really good, too bad no one had much to say. The usually scary tactics were played out as usual but the CGI bugs, were really not bad. <br/><br/>How this movie cost 26 million and takes place in basically one location, the supermarket, is beyond me. Don't tell me it cost 22 million in CGI. <br/><br/>It seems to take place in Portland, OR which could be better off with a ""mist"" to eliminate some of the smug, herbal groovy, sustainable religious folks.<br/><br/>Ending is unsatisfying, yet meant to be a ""shocking"" and ""ironic"" twist on a usual plot, but you could see it coming a mile away. Oh, and the music sound track at the ending is way overwhelming..they should have used something much less ponderous, like maybe Glassworks, by Phillip Glass. I hear that pseudo Monkish, Russian sound way too often over trivial concepts.<br/><br/>The Mist could easily be reedited to 1/2 hour and (Twilight zoned). I say, keep Frank in a prison not a supermarket to reveal his real talents."
"elshikh4","7","0","4","19 June 2012"," Darabont builds the tension right, but not the ending !
","After watching this, I found myself saying ironically: ""Man is the stupidest sane creature in the world!"". Something good to quote, huh?!<br/><br/>This is - finally - a horror that has something to present beside its gore. Actually, it may be a movie about the human in the modern age; which happens to be a horror. Just remember that it's written and directed by (Frank Darabont) to know well that it's not another time filler slasher. (Darabont) wrote and directed before (The Shawshank Redemption) which was - as the same as (The Mist) - based on a book by (Stephen King). What (Darabont) did there, he does here, in terms of making something deep, with something thrilling.<br/><br/>A group of middle class people is imprisoned in local grocery store, being all besieged by unknown danger that turns out to be huge lethal bugs. It's outwardly a disaster / sci-fi / horror movie, but inwardly about that supermarket community, its fears, expatriation and aberration. That consuming society is all about eating and drinking. They are selfish, living as strangers, and never done anything together unless shopping. That grocery store became the only spot where they meet together, and thus represented their being itself. So when they are trapped together, their hidden facts are quickly shown. From class struggle and spiritual emptiness, to psychological complexes and plain cowardice. Being confused is the surface only, which develops some thrill to watch. But being stupid is the core, which demands some time to contemplate.<br/><br/>While the movie showcases many characters, it doesn't go deep in them. It just showcases their deeds. That wasn't enough according to a movie wants to go behind the surface I think. However, the most horrible shortcoming that this movie has is its ending. It wanted to say that human is a headlong, desperate, and so dumb creature. Unfortunately that was made in unconvincing way. The lead was an ideal action hero from the start. I didn't notice anything irrational about him. His thinking and doing showed nothing but intelligence and boldness. So when he did what he did at the end; that was totally bizarre. It was more than obvious that the script pushed him to do it, so the intended moral would be complete. But to ""push"", in terms of good writing, is bad. To ""build"" is the needed, which this script didn't really care about. It throws its pure perception in our faces without much attention to rooting it dramatically first. It seems to be that not going deep into the characters is the actual, and only, problem this movie has.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the rest of the movie is near to flawless. Artistically, it is well done. The directing orchestrated all the elements to make a solid horror, and philosophical testimony, all while having limited budget as well. In a rare time, the shaken camera managed to be smartly realistic and no annoying. The tense was about being tangible throughout. The CGI was thoroughly designed and moved. Their uniqueness along with truthfulness were another rare matter. The monstrous bugs can be read as a part of the characters' world's rot. Imagine what kind of insects that live in a filthy place, so accordingly imagine how big that place itself could be to have insects as the ones we saw (gives you a hint to how this movie pictures our world!). Surely, that harmonizes fine with the supermarket community theme whereas it divides those consumers' town into grocery store and one big dump around. The performance was into the point, however quite wronged by the script. The characters were stereotypical ghosts, with no creativeness. For a clear instance, the heroine is a good woman, and that's it! Talking isn't this movie's talent. It was about doing, which is good, but not to a degree where the characters seem underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Yes, believe it or not, unlike endless ordinary horror movies, the title has a wily pun. This is about the mist inside the mind of today's human who used to consume more than build, feed on joys of life instead of living that life, and fear as a substitute for faith. Being lost in that haze bemused the compass of reasonableness, ended any hope and easily killed the lead's kid by the lead's own hands. That's what this movie has in mind. The thing is the movie didn't mind about it much. So while trying to add something extra to a genre movie, something intellectual and critical, (The Mist) wasn't plenary. (Darabont), who stipulated earlier that the production company must not change his end, didn't play that end rightly.<br/><br/>In brief: A breathtaking and thought-provoking horror. Yet, if the thought-provoking side was as well made as the breathtaking side, this could have been one of the best movies in the last decade. Alas, as a scriptwriter, (Darabont) said that human was stupid, but not in a perfectly ""smart"" way!"

","Steven king writes about some of the best stuff. The main topic of this movie isn't necessarily about the crazy out of world creatures, it's the message questioning humanity. One of Steven kings great features is writing about some if life's mysteries, basically saying is humanity stable? And some what of, is there other forms of lifes. The movie it's self loses some points in my book for the terrible acting in this movie, by many of the supporting actors.if they had a stronger actor as main character too would be great, his screams at the end were just subpar. The beginning of the movie had me questioning a lot of things, acting, if this movie is even considerable, and basically everything they were doing. After that the movie gets progressively better. But it's the thought of the movie that really makes it a good watch, not what was actually happening or the acting. It questions how we would handle these kind of situation, who will we turn to, what will we do. Some twists and turns in the movie improve it greatly, with a sad ending, but it includes a common Steven king topic, religion. Religion plays a strong role and a lot of the scenes in the movie follow religion. It was a good watch and the twists, and fairly frequent scene changes and frequent deaths of characters kept me from eventually noticing to many flaws, overall decent movie, great idea! My favorite part is really Ollie in the movie, he is great<3"

","I liked this film despite the cheesy special effects and unexpected ending. It had interesting characters and good interaction among them. After 10 minutes I was hooked. And then, the strange ending. It was unusual, although not entirely original. It was the type you'd see in a Twilight Zone episode. In fact, the entire film had a Twilight Zone feel. Many Twilight Zone episodes dealt with human nature, mob mentality and twisted irony. This film had it all. Frank Darabont all but confirmed my suspicion he was borrowing from the old Twilight Zone series when he released a black and white version.<br/><br/>I'm surprised the producers allowed such an ending. I would have preferred-- dare I say-- a more Hollywood ending, but I still enjoyed the film."
"Sandcooler","6","0","2","29 October 2011"," Decent, but well below Darabont's standards
","Frank Darabont is a director that just really loves his characters, and because of that I figured Stephen King's ""The Mist"" would be right up his alley. The entire book is about a bunch of people who don't know each other being stuck in the same place for ages, which sorta resembled...hey wait a minute, that IS every Frank Darabont movie. However, ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" centered around compelling protagonists and delightfully goofy side characters, while most people in this adaptation of ""The Mist"" are just boring. Take Marcia Gay Harden's religious fanatic for instance, how does such a bland, one-dimensional character get so much screen time? Thomas Jane isn't really much better though, and he's the freaking lead. It's not all bad however, story-wise ""The Mist"" definitely has its moments. It's pretty nice how the horror is gradually built up, and it also leads to a true killer of an ending. There's lots of interesting stuff happening, it just doesn't happen to interesting people. When you look at this as a Darabont film, it's disappointing. When you don't, I guess it's not bad."

","The first thing that must be said about this movie are three little words, Marcia Gay Harden! She is phenomenal! Her performance in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen her. Not very often does a supporting character out shine every other cast member in a film and that is exactly what she does in this movie.<br/><br/>So I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that in recent years the film adapted from Stephen King novels have been extremely underwhelming, so it's good to see one that hits the mark. The story is adapted from a novella about a small town that is overtaken by a mysterious fog that inhabits supernatural beings, who I might say are chilling.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is great as usual as the leader of a group of people who escape from the mist in a local supermarket. The film is primarily about the must and what horror it has brought to the town but there's another element if this film which is great, the human instinct to turn against each other in stressful situation, this is when Marcia Gay Harden really starts to shine, her character, the psychotic and super religious Mrs Carmody is equally as terrifying as the beings that inhabit the mist.<br/><br/>The production of The Mist is excellent, the scenes where the locals venture out of the supermarket into the mist is so edge of your seat stuff. Excellent.<br/><br/>It's great to see a horror film that doesn't rely on blood and guts to produce the scares... A+"

","And I'm not just talking about the monsters. Human stupidity and inhumanity is the clear winner in this flick. I'll do this in order. *Spoilers ahead*. When sh*t starts going down, the cast is stranded in a grocery store. There is one woman who left her two children (an 8 yo and a toddler) home while she went to the store. After witnessing the horrific death of someone, she explains her irresponsibility to everyone and then asks for an escort home. And when no one volunteers, she has the NERVE to get mad at everyone as if they should be ashamed of themselves. Lady, please tell me, if there really is something out there killing people, what is an escort going to do? That's right, die with you (that is if she actually had died). You want someone to risk their life to keep you company because you are scared. And get this, SHE DOES LIVE! But not without passing the hero (who had made some pitiful choices not 1 minute prior) in an army SUV and looks down at him with condescension. <br/><br/>Then you've got people who refuse to listen to reason. Take the black man. He heard the blood curdling scream of a dying man in the parking lot and there are people BEGGING him to look at evidence of monsters right around the corner...and he won't do it. Better still, you think their insistence is little more than a ploy to make YOU look bad. Don't give yourself the credit. <br/><br/>Oh let's not forget the people, who go nuts and immediately turns to the crazy woman for answers. Really? I'll leave you to watch that on your own.<br/><br/>And finally the ending. Apparently when you've got no other options, you kill your child...to save them of course. But the thing is they HAD options. They could have sat there and waited. Who knows. Maybe someone might come by. ""Oh come on that's ridiculous"".

It's got a very strong, very creepy survival-horroresque first hour with believable characters, a tight plot and the necessary vagueness of the actual threat. And a - at least for me - ridiculously far-fetched character development through the second half culminating in a blueprint ""what the...!?""-ending.<br/><br/>But first things first: So we get a short exposition of a family spending the night in their cellar because of a t-storm. The next morning, dad and his son go get some supplies at a local store to fix the damaged house. There are a lot of people there, sirens howling, mist coming up, everything's foggy, people die in the fog and things roll from there...<br/><br/>As i said, the first 60 minutes are really building up suspense, there are a lot of things going on, lots of different creatures and especially the scare/action scenes are acted out very believable. Some of the characters are a little cardboardy (like an New York lawyer or some redneck types) but nothing too silly. There are a tad too many characters put into this first half so you really can't relate to any of the early deaths; Oh, she died, OK, who was she again?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. The group dynamics of the survivors are just too exaggerated, the consequences unbelievable to the point where they're outright ridiculous. The movie starts smelling of wannabe religious/social criticism and honestly, I think this should have been better left out altogether. As for the conclusion, without spoiling anything; The final sequence lacks credibility and the ""dramatic twist"" is so ""inverted deus ex machina"" it made me rub my eyes in disbelief...<br/><br/>So well, do I recommend it?

","Stephen King's work has been growing on me, I wasn't crazy about it before but after seeing and reading more of his books and the film/TV series adapted from them I do respect his style, he has a unique and I think unparallelled way of describing fear, and find his ideas intriguing. In all honesty, The Mist is not one of the best film adaptations. The book was very good, if not great, but the film was just decent. It looks great with great photography and effects, the story is intriguing and starts off very well, the acting especially from Marcia Gay Holden is good as is the direction, there is a strong atmosphere and the soundtrack and sound further adds to it. I was almost though willing to forgive the sometimes pedestrian pacing and clunky dialogue, until the ending let the film down completely. The ending is a slap in the face not only for fans of the book or King but also for those like me saw a film with so much promise, and its tone feels like a completely different movie. In conclusion, was pretty good, if only it weren't for that ending. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"jacco59","8","0","2","11 May 2011"," Terribly awesome, one-of-a-kind film
","Most Stephen King movies are good, some even awesome (Misery, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile), and The Mist can count itself amongst those three. If you've read the book, you'll know how close the movie keeps to the book, but that's only good, because the book is so awesome (i'm a Stephen King fan too :). The fact that there's almost no music (apart from some music at the end, but that fits in perfectly) makes the atmosphere tense and makes the characters seem more realistic. The movie, far from being a run-of-the-mill horror flick, shows how people can lose their heads and turn to anyone who promises them savior (Mrs. Carmody). Apart from that frightening idea, there's also plenty of 'regular' horror, with about 3 bloody scenes. That may seem nothing compared to say Saw 3,which is basically one big bloody scene, but if there were too much blood no one would take it seriously, because (forgive me) those ""Other dimension creatures"" are a bit too fake to believe. But the very best part of the movie is the terrible ending in which **HUGE FREAKING SPOILER** the main character, David, his son of 5, a woman he met at the supermarket, and two old people, one of which is his old elementary school teacher, are sitting in the car in which they had fled, which had run out of gas, and so they know that they're going to die because the Other dimension creatures are everywhere in the mist. David takes out his gun, which has 4 bullets in it but they are with five. He shoots the others, including his 5 year old son, while he really wanted to die himself too. He crawls out of the car, wanting to be killed by the creatures, but then the army come down the road. And the terrible truth occurs to you: he just killed 4 people, including his son, for nothing! With that thought, the movie is over. I remained dead still in my seat for 2 minutes. A masterpiece."

","The Mist is one of my all time favourite King novels so I was nervous when I heard they were making a film adaptation of it. But this is a great horror movie. True to the novel, it does begin rather slowly. But this is crucial, as you are introduced to an array of characters. Also true to the novel, is the truly despicable and wonderfully hated woman Mrs. Carmody. I guarantee you'll love to hate her. For a film made in 2007, the special effects are admittedly lacking. But it is our own imagination that makes this film truly horrifying. The acting is at times, a little cringe worthy. There are also several very awkward conversations. Apart from those little problems, this movie is solid."

We do get a mysterious creature in the back of the store. I would have preferred lots more creatures. Then you've got a stubborn man (played by Andre Braugher) who refuses to have anything to do with these people, which I think helps move the story along.

","Another Stephen King story, this one about a group of people in Maine (of course) who hold up in a grocery store when a mysterious mist, possibly obscuring something dangerous, descends upon their town. The first twenty or thirty minutes of this movie promise one of the best horror movies of the past decade. And there's a lot afterward that would lend to that assessment, too. Unfortunately, The Mist has a couple of fatal flaws that nearly make it a bad movie. First and foremost, Marcia Gay Harden's ultra-religious nutbag character. You know exactly where they're going with this right away, but you don't hope it takes up too much screen time. But, lo and behold, it becomes a major plot point, maybe THE major plot point, and you're just praying for it to end with a bullet in her forehead. And then there's the unintentionally hilarious ending. I'm guessing that in the Stephen King novella, the characters stranded in the out-of-gas car wait for maybe more than thirty seconds before they decide to do something drastic (ETA: apparently the final image of the book is the characters driving off into the mist, the reader never learning what happened to them). These are, after all, people who have fought for their lives for the previous hour and fifty-five minutes. And then the predictable irony, with one character on his knees shouting like a dufus while gas-masked Army guys stroll on by. Yeah, sue me, I laughed. Still, I'd recommend it for the awesome set-up and a handful of excellent sequences."

","I haven't read the original novella by King. One of the few people who seems able to make the authors stuff work well on screen without dramatically altering it is Darabont, and for how much this is essentially a gross-out B-movie with monsters, he largely does do pretty well. Stephen is the literary equivalent to fast food; he even admits so, himself. Why he is so celebrated is an enigma I don't expect to find the answer to. Hey; this manages an isolation, ""we're trapped!"" kind of thing, and it does so without losing our attention. That deserves, nay, *demands*, props. There are a couple of good, fleshed out characters. It strives to show truths about humanity, though its chance at doing so gradually fades away in the face of the shrill tone of the sides in conflict. Not to mention the audience's exposure to an intolerable religious nut, who'll frustrate atheists and believers(well, Christian ones, at least) alike. The acting varies, particularly that of the kid, who goes back and forth between being natural and lacking credibility. Jane carries it nicely, and those that are given a lot to do usually live up to the challenge. This provides jump scares and a couple of exciting bits, and there is some decent tension here and there. The quality of the FX ranges, and the integration of CGI elements with live-action is hit and miss, too. Designs aren't bad, though obviously not everyone will consider these creatures to be intimidating(I didn't, to be honest). There is plenty of bloody, gory violence, a lot of disturbing content and infrequent strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the writer. 7/10"
"chser453","6","0","2","21 February 2010"," Whats with the squealing monsters?
","Being a fan of Darabonts previous King works i remember at the time was looking forward to seeing this. The premise is straightforward; 50 or so people trapped in a small town store trapped by a mysterious mist that has descended and surrounded containing a host of monsters/prehistoric type creatures/beings from another dimension. It's the standard 'siege style' horror genre but the monsters are an aside to the underlying theme which scrutinises the human frailties, despair and hysteria. This was the interesting part of the film, focusing more of what is happening on the inside than the outside, but i don't think it was developed enough, as a horror movie it should have been taken on further, perhaps onto the more even terrifying conclusion of mob and witch-hunt type mentality that comes from a breakdown of reality,which was only touched upon. The plot did have a few holes too, it was also a little unbelievable that the lowly army Private was able to clarify 'rumours' of a top secret army experiment nearby to open a rift to another dimension.<br/><br/>The cgi creatures were good, apart from a very formulaic B movie looking rubber tentacle. As is typical, most of them came out in the dark of night which, coincidentally makes them easier to cgi-render into the film. The giant mosquito bug things will get your skin crawling, however the spider things just looked like the flying bugs without the wings, a little more imagination required next time. It would be good too if Hollywood could get out of the habit of making all their monsters squeal like pigs when they get shot or hit with an axe; do u really expect that sort of noise to come out of a tentacle or a giant spider?? As for the ending, i guess it was supposed to be tragic which it was but, without giving the whole thing away, i thought 'it' was a little hasty and could have been drawn out a little to have been a bit more understandable. But thats perhaps being over critical.<br/><br/>I did quite like the movie overall, i don't think all the acting was that strong, i didn't really feel for the characters or convinced by their emotion and thought Andre Braughers talent was under used. The lead guy kept reminding me of the guy out of Highlander too which didn't help. Its definitely worth a watch and better than most modern horror flicks ( although most of its modern competition is trash these days) but this film though i think could have been a whole lot better. 6 out of 10"

","Frank Darabont and Stephen King must have a real special working relationship. The best Stephen King adaptations have been done adapted and directed by Frank Darabont (except for the Shining), whilst Frank Darabont greatest success has come from directing King's prison fiction. However with The Mist Darabont has step out of his comfort zone (but to great effect).<br/><br/>In a small town in New England, David (Thomas Jane) is a successful artist living happily with his wife (Kelly Collins Lintz) and young son, Billy (Nathan Gamble). After a powerful thunderstorm their home suffers damage, so David, Billy and their next door neighbour Brent (Andre Braugher) go to the local supermarket to get good for the replaces they need to do. Whilst at the store a strange mist descends on the town, and scare monsters living withing it. This is confirmed when a bagboy is killed, but some people like Brent do not believe in monsters, and think there is a more logical explanation. When the monsters start to attack and people start dying, some people take extreme action, some fight, some run, others commit suicide, whilst others turn to Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a fundamentalist Christian and local nutcase. As the people in the siege become more desperate they start to listen to Carmody who has a fire and brimstone view of the Bible and see the monsters attack as a punishment from God. David and some other people do not like the way things are turning within the supermarket and have to fight Carmody from corrupting everyone.<br/><br/>The monsters are effectively done, whilst the action is exciting. They is some blood and gore, and with a budget of $18 Million, the CGI is top-notch. But whilst the monsters are well done, the real horror isn't from that threat, it's from the threat of people. It is a commentary of how desperate people will become and look for some sort of order, even if its from extreme sorts. Carmody is an example of Christian and religion at it's worst, a dogmatic belief where you try and enforce it on others. She reminds of Phelps family, a horrible family who see America as a decadent nation which is about to collapse because of homosexuality, and picket outside the funerals of dead soldiers. These are people who claim there are Christians but are anything but, and give all religion a bad name. It's this theme of religion and control which is the real horror of the film, makes you think and stays in your mind. The ending is also very howling and bleak, which is surprising from a Hollywood film. Frank Darabont shows once again what a talented storyteller he is, with a well rounded, three dimensional characters. Carmody is a true example of a antagonist, whilst David and everyone else is a ordinary person in a extreme situation.<br/><br/>There are some problems with the film. Whilst most of the acting is decent, and Carmody is a character you love to hate I think Marcia Gay Harden could and should have been stronger. There are some plot problems, like how quickly it takes people to descend into chaos and disorder (but admittedly that was on of the main themes of the film). The third act was also not as strong as the rest of the film, despite the dark ending.<br/><br/>However a good example of a horror film, and I recommend it: especially if you like Cloverfield and the Japanese Godzilla. There are also similarities to Aliens."

Once inside however, an impenetrable mist covers the town and anyone who ventures into it is torn apart by some monstrous force. Can David escape and save his son from this mysterious terror ?<br/><br/>This fine adaptation of a terrific novella by Stephen King is a proper, out-and-out, full-on horror flick. It's doubly scary because the horror is just as much about what happens to the people inside the store as the diabolical creatures outside. Mrs Karmody's lunatic rantings and stomach-turning misanthropy in the name of religion are frighteningly real and believable. The movie also has an incredibly grim ending (unlike the novella, which has an unresolved odyssey, Ã  la The Birds), perhaps the most downbeat I've ever seen with the exception of The Seventh Victim and Night Of The Living Dead. Like many good horror/suspense films (see the work of John Carpenter particularly), it puts its heroes in an extreme siege situation and then watches them slowly tear each other to pieces. If you are looking for some compliments on the intelligence and philanthropy of mankind in the face of adversity this is the not the movie for you. The cast are great; it's hard to play this type of material completely straight and not seem ridiculous, but it's crucial to the success of the suspense and everyone scores. Harden is amazing in the plum role, spitting out her bilious speeches, her whole body twisted with animosity, whilst Jane (who resembles a youthful King) is a solid centre to the film. The entire support cast seem to grasp the tone exactly, with some fine turns by old pro Sternhagen, and Darabont regulars DeMunn and Sadler. Equally good are the scary special effects, by Howard Berger, Greg Nicotero and Everett Burrell; the night sequence where the bugs smash their way into the store and wreak bloody havoc is as hair-raising a scene as any in modern cinema. Mark Isham also provides an odd, dreamlike, choral score, accentuating the surreal quality of the situation and the depths of the characters' grief at their predicament. All in all then, a grown-up scary movie where the suspense sticks a knife in you and then twists it; another first-rate lensing of King's work from the talented Darabont. Trivia fans should note that the story was first published as the coda in Kirby McCauley's 1980 horror anthology Dark Forces, but also appears as the opener in King's 1985 short story collection, Skeleton Crew."

It's the same case for this film as well big time, seriously Andre Braugher is way better than this and so it was really disappointing. The moonstruck woman really makes you get angry and I think that was the intention, but gosh was she knowing constantly babbling on while using religion for her own benefit not that it never happens but she was really irritating to the point you just want to pull her out of the screen Sadako style and choke her.

","I read the Stephen King novella some 25 years ago and it was already gripping back then in its effective, ""Dawn of the dead""-like simplicity (a large group of people gets trapped inside a supermarket as a mysterious mist surrounds them with unspeakable terrors lurking inside it). But to actually expand, extend and IMPROVE it, was beyond my wildest expectations, as Darabont turns this horror-fantasy tale into a visceral, nerve-rattling apocalypse. The supernatural monsters are quite impressively scary (if a bit too CGI-graphic...), but they almost pale in comparison to its human counterparts as the panic mounts with a religious loony in the crowd. There is a truly terrifying human sacrifice scene which will haunt me for a long time... Knowing it was written in the 80's also answers some modern obvious plot questions (umm - anyone got a cell phone?). <br/><br/>A bit long, but thumbs up for really going for the throat and daring to be merciless with its characters to the very end! Another tool is what I've advocated for a long time: a very limited music score; it's ghastly enough as it is - and parents: be sure to keep your kids away from this! <br/><br/>7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"

","Stephen king now bestrides the horror genre as a colossus and this cinematic interpretation of his novel is a fine one. Although all the thematic devices are obviously there, the screenplay by Frank Darabont provides a pleasing intelligence adding a further credit to his prior successes with the Green Mile and the Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>The formula is well concocted. The unexplained mist that descends on a backwater town comes with the same menace as John Carpenters ""The Fog"". A supermarket provides both a refuge, and a prison for those engulfed, echoing Carpenters ""Assault on Precinct 13"", whilst the crazed antics of the assailants and their victims are reminiscent of Romero's work.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is a convincing lead as hero David Drayton with Laurie Holden offering the glamour and a mother figure for Drayton's young son who is also trapped.The stand out performance however is by supporting actress by Marcia Harden as Mrs Carmody playing a fundamentalist Christian convinced that Armageddon is upon them and whipping up a ""Witches of Salem"" hysteria.<br/><br/>The CGI is largely convincing, the suspense well created, and the gore sufficient for aficionados of the genre whilst not being used as an easy substitute for dramatic tension.The only let down is the ending. just before it I reflected that a certain ending wold be both childishly amusing, and preposterous - and then it happened!Nonetheless the previous 125 minutes more than compensate for this.

","The Mist is a Movie who's title might not make one expect much but for those who decide to watch it it is quite good. What makes it good? Well the monsters and the whole scenario of going into the mist and being dragged off to a horrible screaming death aren't what make this movie great, what makes it stand out is the tension that steadily mounts amongst the people trapped in the supermarket. This is not a very new idea either, it is pretty much what George Romero tried to show in his first 4 living dead movies where it was actually the people who were unable to cooperate who got themselves killed. What's great is that just when Romero completely messed up with ""Diary of the Dead"" we get a new movie that explores man as the bringer of his own downfall. The acting was very good and the ending was quite shocking (though believable).<br/><br/>Highly recommended for those who don't mind moral stereotypes being broken."

","""The Mist"" is an enjoyable horror movie based on a story written by Stephen King. The basic premise of the plot centers on a time dimension hole that the US Army has opened up in an effort to gain access to alternate universal time dimensions. Our core characters are stranded in a rural grocery store when the Army's experiment goes awry.<br/><br/>I was personally impressed with the production values of this film. I know a lot of people have complained about the CGI and the twist ending, but I was totally fine with both. I just don't know what audiences want from horror movie anymore. Sometimes I think movie goers are happier with slap dash horror remakes being shoved down their throats. I mean these people crying about CGI and a twist ending, get a life.<br/><br/>Listen, the film was well made, that's it. It's not a great film by any means, but I got the feeling that both the corporate and artistic ends of this production really cared about making a quality horror film they could stand behind. True, there could have been more gore, more scares, and better monsters; but I'll take ""The Mist"" over any recent horror remake in a heart-beat. <br/><br/>I really can't think of any substantial faults with this production. If you like Stephen King horror film adaptations, you will love this one. I like even the worst films based on King's work, but ""The Mist"" is far from the worst. In fact, it very well may be in the top five, but it will never beat Kubrick's ""Shining"". If you haven't seen this movie, ignore the negative reviews and go and watch it. If you've seen this movie and don't like it, go watch the remake of ""The Hitcher""."

","The Mist starts extremely well, the very fog, the horror of the first minutes, the first victims - that all seems to be utterly great and captivating... but then, after almost 90 minutes, I started to ask myself if I ever got the answers to some burning questions. The very end of the movie is so improbable, so shallow and so illogical that the 1 question was - Why struggling so much if the end is going to be so silly and so hopeless? The explanation of the whole monsters' attack is also so very thin and so disillusioning that the 2 question rings like - Could the film makers invent some really more exciting explanation? Apart from that, the whole film is a good suspense horror and a very true King's work... If only they improved some weaker spots a bit..."
"svetlastoyanova","8","0","2","6 October 2008"," Not where, WHO are we?
","I cannot say I liked the movie but I did like the idea of it. The cast is relatively unknown, not bad thought. The special effects are very CGI; it looked as if I cut out the monsters on Photoshop, using the Natural History Museum catalogue, for prehistoric species. Yet, they are not around for long or very often, and most of the time, are just a shadow in the Mist. That is a good title, I have to admit, and the story line itself is truthful and logical. This is what I like most about Steven King's adaptations they have reason and always a good explanation to them no matter how fantastic or extraordinary the occurring events are.<br/><br/>There was a simple one for this one too- the military. If anything ever goes wrong it is always the military to blame. Anyway that is not the point, what I like the most is the portrayal of the people in extreme situations. They are not people anymore; they are just mammals who all of a sudden happened to be at the bottom of the food chain.<br/><br/>We people believe we are civilised, because we live in societies and we develop technologically. But as one of the characters in the movie said, take away the 999 emergency call and scare them to death and you can forget all about humanity and morals. The real monsters are not the ones in the mist but the ones within.<br/><br/>We are the very same creatures we were 2000 years ago, psychologically we have changed very little, the difference is that now we have more gadgets to play with. Do not get shocked or as some governments are appalled by the monstrosities of today's world and peoples actions, like terrorism and war in the 21 century. This is still us but in more natural environment.<br/><br/>What did not make sense was the end. It was ironic and very, very harsh, but it was very illogical and unfair. The only people who had the guts to go outside and seek rescue had died and the cowards in the supermarket had probably been rescued. Yet if you have the guts to go that far in order to survive would you give up that easy , didn't one of them say she'd rather die looking for help than being sacrificed by her own kind.<br/><br/>Watch that movie...

","OK, this is my first time ever reviewing here, and despite the enormous amount of people that voted this movie as a 7, I have to disagree. I've read some of the reviews attempting to defend this film, and I will admit they have a point. Yes it is unnecessary to be spoon-fed all info, and in a movie like this, information or character BIOS don't make it any better. Stephen has given us both some of the best horror movies ever, and some of the most awful ones too, with everything else in between. I think this it's not his worst and definitely not his best work. At some points the great cast manages to tell the story and rescue the plot from being ""the children of the corn"", at others it is painfully overacted and filled with involuntary humor, the worst kind. Still, as much as I dislike this film in particular, I knew I wasn't in for a Oscar-winning performance, or even an MTV-Movie-Awards-winning one, I mean, nobody goes to see a horror flick expecting to see a work of art, not in these days at least. My point being, it's not disappointing, personally I hate it, but I admit that it's not the worst worse movie I've seen, and if you're in the proper mood, it can be quite entertaining. The end of the movie ALMOST makes it worthwhile, it provides for a good pondering. So go ahead sand watch this, if you like the genre you're in for a treat, for all the actual TRUE lovers of cinema, well, you wouldn't be caught dead watching this, but for those misfortunate souls that are curious, and might be thinking of giving it a chance..

","When approaching ""The Mist"", keeping an open mind is possibly the best thing. It's based on a Stephen King novella, but it is no straight forward horror tale. The film is a moulding of fear and the decline in community bonding during a disaster. The story centres round a supermarket full of people in an idyllic lakeside town who are trapped in by a mysterious fog that has had people screaming of a mysterious entity killing fellow locals.<br/><br/>Won't want to give the story away on ""The Mist"" of what it is or not, but that is really secondary to the main gist of it all. The film is really an allegory of civil decline in a period of distress, with parallels from events surrounding Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in the US. The mix in the supermarket include a fundamentalist Christian, a high-end lawyer, local blue collar workmen, army cadets and so on, whilst the main character is a father (Thomas Jane) who is desperate to survive with his son. The relations of the people together is what makes this a fascinating movie, and its the people who have as much to fear inside as to what there is outside.<br/><br/>I have to be honest that I'm not into horror novels but Stephen King is gifted and it shows here. If there were some bigger names in the lead roles then I'm sure this would have been lauded higher than it has been. However, that is not to deny some good acting, with a outstanding performance by Marcia Gay Harden as the self-styled/appointed doom sayer Mrs Cormody.<br/><br/>Definitely one to go for if you like an intelligent horror tale. Of late, there's been way too much torture porn in the horror film stakes crowding all else out, and this is a good redress for the whole ilk. A good viewing."

Even directors who obviously hated the ending change them up a bit in the films still lack the conclusive and powerful ending. The ending here is no different than most of the films based on Kings work. It always seems to fall into a non-intelligent spiral of what the heck was that.<br/><br/>We have a group of people who are fighting for there very lives threw out this beautiful production then right at the end all they can think to do is ... -spoiler-<br/><br/>... kill each other? I'm sorry this isn't what would have happen to anyone who has fought so long and hard to stay alive. This isn't the actions of a survivor.<br/><br/>The real story: At the end as the car is running out of fuel our survivors look at each other and jokingly say ""looks like we are walking the rest of the way"" knowing if something goes wrong the father still has a few shots in the pistol to be used on themselves instead of dieing a gruesome death. The group staying close together moves down the road slowly without making a noise a long time passes the car far behind them now when suddenly a huge monster emerges from the ""fading"" mist. The creature poised to attack rears up to make a deadly strike as the father looks down at his child. When suddenly an A10 warthog comes screaming in, auto cannon blazing blowing the deadly creature into a mass of jello. The mist clears and the army trucks begin moving down the road one stops to assist and our heroes have survived to tell the tale.<br/><br/>That's what I think of when I see this film not the crap ending that was actually used."

","Having just seen 'The Mist', I can truly say that I was actually p***d off at some of the characters in the movie and that hasn't happened to me since I saw 'Dancer in the Dark' by Von Trier. So that's a compliment to director Frank Darabont, seeing the fact that he didn't portrait these characters as evil or wrong, but frightened and misguided.<br/><br/>I also thought that the creatures in this movie weren't that scary at all, just (for some reason) really angry with the townspeople, especially those creatures who roamed the drugstore. Not one moment did they caught me off guard or got me on the edge of my seat, something the people trapped in the store did succeed in.<br/><br/>What Frank Darabont has shown us is a very probable way people would react in a situation over which they have no control with no help in sight. And that is exactly what makes this movie scary. People turning against each other to save themselves while being guided by a false prophet who controls their every move.<br/><br/>***Spoiler Alert!!*** About the ending, just this; the fact that the protagonist shoots the people in the car, including his own son in order to save them from a death far worse was believable to me. As far as they knew there was no hope left, especially not after seeing the enormous creature crossing the road, which led me to believe they were somewhere in the middle of the mist. Why delay your misery any longer when you have an easier, probably less painful way out? The fact that the army shows up after he shoots them left me somewhat heartbroken.<br/><br/>Yet another good movie that I will never watch again because of the ending.

","Although it was a short story, that I've read a long time ago, I never forgot this one and I was very pleased to hear that 'The Mist' was being made into a movie. Most Stephen King book to movie translations can be rated between bad and really bad, but still I've always had sort of a weak for (most of) these films. There are a few exceptions of course, for example, The Shining, in my opinion still the best horror film ever made(the Kubrick version that is). The Mist isn't as good or as scary as Kubrick's masterpiece, and although it has the same director/co-writer, it also can't compare to The Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile, it was still enjoyable and sure had it's creepy moments. I liked a lot of scenes like when a giant praying-mantis-like monster, appeared out of the mist, to grab a human with it's huge claws, and disappeared again. The spiders where cool too, just as the tentacles that came from beneath the door... There also where some things that annoyed me, like the overly present religious woman. If I recall correct, she was also in the book, but she didn't irritate me nearly as much then. I jumped out of my seat and yelled out 'Yes!!! Die you @#%$!' (in my living room, not in the theater), when she was killed. The actors didn't really make the bizarre events more believable for me, I actually had to laugh when a few of them argued about 'how to tell the rest of the people in the supermarket there are tentacles outside...', with dead serious faces. But maybe it would still sound stupid if it where Jack Nickelson and Michael Douglas having the same conversation, I don't know. I also didn't like some of the camera work very much, sometimes it looked like the camera was deliberately calibrated or focused, I think to add some effect, but it was only unpleasant. And then the ending... Stephen King's novel leaves you guessing, an open end; a group of people escape from the supermarket in a car and as they are driving, they find out that they never had a chance, as a tower-high monster walks past them, it had a feeling of despair. The novel ends there, but I guess the writers thought this wouldn't be a very satisfying ending for the movie, and they where probably right. Although I've warned you about the spoilers, I won't tell you how it ends. I'll just tell you that I personally thought: 'Why? Was this really necessary?'. This kind of irony just doesn't happen to anyone. If only he had waited for 5 more minutes, take some time to make the right decision man, why the hurry? But I guess the ending is what people will talk about after seeing the movie. Me, I couldn't believe it and would rather have seen an open ending than this..."

Why did they have to use a cut-off scene right when a direct shot would have been more effective in the ""mean spirited"" ending? Why were the effects so sub-par? If those things were fixed, this would have been one amazing movie. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, considering I did enjoy this movie quite a bit. It's worth a watch, but don't expect to be amazed. It is not scary, it is not disturbing, and it's not anything to brag about.<br/><br/>The single reason I even give this a 4 instead of 1 is because the morality (or questions about it) were pretty interesting, but nothing mind-blowing.<br/><br/>This movie plays it safe.

","I didn't expect to enjoy this film. I thought it would be similar to a lot of the horror/monster movies that Hollywood seems to be churning up every year. Films which had good potential, but were let down by the strength of the characters, such as The Fog, Cloverfield, Dawn Of The Dead etc. However once i discovered this film was based on a Stephen King novel I was more interested, having read a few of them and being aware of his capability to write original and scary books with diverse and complex characters. The Mist definitely has these.<br/><br/>The outline of the plot is that a mist has smothered a town (and the world, I think) and emerging out of it comes a terrifying bunch of monsters which begin killing the inhabitants. The story centres round a man and his son, whom, with many other town members, get trapped within a supermarket with only huge windows to view the mist covered outside world and the creatures that are trying to get inside.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this film stand out compared to so many others is the way it studies human behaviour in a crisis. The people trapped within the store have only each other to rely on and to come up with a plan to escape alive. A character who stands out is Marcia Gay Harden's Mrs Carmody, a deeply religious and deeply disturbed woman who believes that God is punishing humanity for their sins and they should therefore give a sacrifice to the monsters. The people within the store are left with a choice to either fight her or join her. This makes for a more interesting dilemma in the film to see how they cope with this. I can't help but add that if this film had gone down the road that so many other horrors take, which is to use a bunch of good-looking teenagers, it would have been nowhere as good.<br/><br/>The film also has a very different, if depressing ending. I won't reveal too much but i can't believe that a father would be able to do that to his son. This is only a minor grumble about an otherwise good, original horror film."

","I can't say that this was a bad movie but I can't say that I liked it either. I'm a Stephen King fan, and have been for many years. But the main message of this movie seems to be that humanity is too rotten to live. So stay far away if you want something fun to watch.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good overall, although I found the kid that played Thomas Jane's son to be kind of irritating. Marcia Gay Harden in particular did a very good job. So good that if I saw her in person anytime soon after watching the movie I'd probably slap her face.<br/><br/>As far as creature effects go, they were a bit low rent. Not the worst I ever saw, but not the best either. Maybe they should have skipped the puppetry and used more cgi. Probably a budget issue, but also a case of somewhat lackluster creature design. Other special effects were the same. Not the worst but far from big budget best.<br/><br/>Direction was okay. Frank Darabont is no Steven Spielberg but he gets the job done. Camera work was good to very good. Sound and music were both excellent. Editing was good. Writing was okay. I have a minor gripe with the extras. Would have been nice if they had used just one group for the entire film but there was kind of a revolving door amongst the non-speaking cast. The number of people in the store seems to fluctuate also.<br/><br/>My main reason for not particularly liking it is the story itself. It's very dark and does not have the adrenaline rush of many horror films. In fact I wouldn't really call this a horror film at all. More of a psychodrama or even a disaster movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>So the conclusion: If you want something light that will give you a rush I don't advise watching this movie.

","After a storm hits a small coastal town, David Drayton and his son head into town for some supplies. While in the supermarket, a man runs inside saying there is something in the descending mist. Hearing screams, they lock themselves inside. But as tension grows inside due to the biblical comments of Mrs. Carmody, the people begin splitting into groups....<br/><br/>Frank Darabont made The Shawshank Redemption, one of the finest movies ever made. He also made The Green Mile, a good prison drama. Both were based on stories by Stephen King as is The Mist. While this movie isn't as good as Shawshank (but then few movies are), it's a very, very good movie indeed.<br/><br/>The key thing about this movie, is that I don't think Darabont is really that much interested in what is outside in the mist. To me I think he's more interested in how a group of seemingly normal sane people can quickly descend into groups willing to listen to whoever will give them a belief they will live. Here, Mrs. Carmody (brilliantly played by Marcia Gay Harden) convinces them that it's God's will the events taking place. Soon she has others convinced she is right. One could argue she has a point, seeing how it ends, but it's the speed of the way these so-called friends are willing to quickly turn on each other that's more scary. One character says at one point, 'As a species, we're fundamentally insane. Put two of us in a room, we pick sides, and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another.' It's a key statement, and as events progress it is borne out.<br/><br/>That's not to say however that what's in the mist isn't terrifying. Wisely we don't see much of the actual creatures, but when we do, they are scary as hell, especially the sequence in the pharmacy.<br/><br/>Darabont as director gets superb performances from his cast. As mentioned, Harden dominates the movie as Mrs. Carmody, but there are good performances from Thomas Jane, Toby Jones, William Sadler, Andre Braugher, Laurie Holden and others. I've not read the King story, but there are some fantastic lines in the script and everyone rises to the challenge.<br/><br/>However, as bleak as the events in the supermarket are, Darabont gets even bleaker with his ending. Simply put, this will not, and does not end well. The final moments of the movie as David Drayton keeps a promise to stop the creatures getting his son and the others who have left with him, you can almost sense Mrs. Carmody smiling at his shoulder as he pulls the trigger, and kills them. To then find out that if they had waited a few more minutes and the mist would have lifted is shocking. However, I would say that I've been told the ending of the book, and think it's ending is better (the fate of the characters is never revealed). While the film ending works, the final twist (the mist lifting) is a slight let-down.<br/><br/>However, this does not detract from the fact that The Mist is one of the best horror movies of the past few years. As a look at human behavior however, its brilliant. If bleak."

","One of the most moving,shocking movies I've seen lately. I haven't read the story,but I don't think the movie is disappointing,related to it.A mix of fatal,unfortunate choices.The way human nature is presented,the violence people can make abuse of when they're in panic,the way some of us go illogical in tough situations...all of these are fantastically emphasized.<br/><br/>The end is disturbing,and it makes you think that in some situations,death is way better than life.I think the drama of the ending stands in the fact that XXX can't even choose between life and death.You realize if he hadn't done this,or if he hadn't take that,this or that wouldn't have happened.It's all about decisions,and not any decisions,but decisions their lives depend on.It's a 'game' of life and death.And it's sure worth watching."

","Usually, making a movie out of a Stephen King book has not been that successful, at least in my opinion. A lot gets lost from book to screen, but this movie somehow manages to work. The premise is your typical SK storyline: Something Is Out There (sorry for stealing that title) but we do not know what it is, and when we do find out, we do not know where it came from or why. After a major storm hits a local town a strange mist appears from the mountains. An area the military (same old theme, but we have to have a scapegoat or villain somewhere, and the gov't is such an easy target) is stationed doing something secret. Our local hero heads to the grocery with his son to pick up some supplies, and we start out with a fairly large cast trapped inside the grocery store when the mist appears and one of the residents says that something grabbed his friend outside. Before long the people figure out that there is a monster outside, but are not too sure just what or how many. After a few victims and some of the mysterious creatures get inside the store, all believe now. One of the characters is a very religious woman who claims that all that is happening is exactly what happened in the Old Testament, and soon her followers grow in numbers and we then must have our first sacrifice. For most of the movie the plot follows your typical horror movie, and the audience, at least those that read the story, know what will happen. But this is where it gets good. Though the acting was mediocre, even by some outstanding actors (in other flicks), and the alien creatures are done okay, and one cannot stop the feeling that this is a cross between Evolution (with David Duchovny) and War of the Worlds (with Tom Cruise), we somehow know that this is going to be about the same as most other movies with the same basic plot. Until we get to the very end of the movie. Five people manage to make it out of the store and decide to keep on driving until they run out of gas or get out of the mist, and of course they run out of gas. Now what? They are surrounded by the mist and know what waits for them out there. Some notes on the message board say that they do not like the ending and how could a father kill his own son, but in the movie the son cries to and begs his father to not let the monsters get him. So what to do? What would any parent do? There are 5 people and 4 bullets. Do you wait for the monsters to get you or do you end it quickly and sacrifice only yourself to a horrible death? I personally liked the changed ending as it made more of an impact when our hero realizes that the 4 people he shot were killed in vain. A lot of SK stories leave the reader wondering what happened, and the different ending in the movie, IMO, actually made what was an okay movie into a much better movie."

","Well, what can you say. Having seen many US disaster movies why must they always end with the Government troops rolling in and saving (or in this case not) the day. It's been a standard feature of American movies for more than 50 years and I wish film directors/writers could think up another type of ending. It's even infected British movies like the 28 days series. Rescue by soldiers in Hummers is becoming a stock standard ending to the disaster movie. Surely someone can think of an another type of ending other than the troops appearing in the fog? Movies like Them! (1954) and such-like used the ""troops save the day"" as a reassurance that the US could stand up to the communist threat. What excuse have they now? A good movie but let down by the overdone and trite finish."

","It was a friend of mine who convinced me to go watch this film. Before i went to watch this movie, like any other movie i usually plan to watch i checked its ratings on IMDb and saw the 7.5 it was given and thought it cant be bad. the opening scenes of the movie get straight to the point and into the title of the movie. It didn't exactly have me in suspense but had me a little curious to actually what will happen next. As the movie developed i wasn't all that impressed. the kid in the movie couldn't act and he was trying too hard to act like he was scared and needed his father. when the bugs appear i was let down by the poor graphics and it didn't seem all that convincing either. i liked the way there became divisions within the group of people in the supermarket but the whole religious thing was taken over the top. in reality more people would favour the rational person than the religious fanatic. the religious lady did well in the beginning with her preaching the fulfilled prophecies but then when the whole 'sacrificing people' theme come along it started to become ridiculous for me to believe that would happen. up until the end of the movie it was watchable, nothing special but just watchable. HOWEVER the ending absolutely blows away the audience. it was the only real punch that this movie delivers. its been a long time since I've seen such a good and different ending to a movie, simply because u don't expect that to happen. I ususally don't watch horrors but i would advise people to watch this movie simply for the ending. the rest of the movie wont carry ur suspense and neither will it create a suspense, it will however have you curious but the ending will have u shocked. all questions are answers in this movie but i gave it a seven simply because the ending carried it from a 5/10 to a 7/10."
"FlorisV","7","0","2","13 July 2008"," Stephen King all the way, not too original though
","I really like Stephen King films, even if they're just in his storyteller's style without the story actually been his (movies like Creepy Crawlers). Townsfolk, real communities, people you can care about are usually given some room for characterizations before bad things start to happen and this one is no different.<br/><br/>This is not the most original horror movie ever (Dawn of the Dead and The Fog come to mind among a slew of monster movies) and it's certainly not the best as some claim. The only monster we have never seen before is in the ending and it doesn't get much action. Yup, it's about monsters. And the real monsters are the humans when they're desperate and scared.<br/><br/>It's a good, enjoyable film though with good acting. Never a dull moment and you really keep wondering...what's next. The hysteric ranting about the apocalypse does fit in well because at first it seems like they're struck with one biblical plague after another.<br/><br/>An OK film that's worth a view if you like Stephen King films. Some mentioned Ctulhu and the story definitely seems inspired by H.P. Lovecraft at some point (won't spoil it). I would definitely love to see film adaptations of that writer. It seems King has had his share now, time to move on to a long-overlooked author."

","After a violent storm attacks a town in Maine, an approaching cloud of mist appears the next morning. As the mist quickly envelops the area, a group of people get trapped in a local grocery store-among them, artist David Drayton and his five-year-old son. The people soon discover that within the mist lives numerous species of horrific, unworldly creatures that entered through an inter-dimensional rift, which may or may not have been caused by a nearby military base. As the world around them manifests into a literal hell-on-earth, the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster.<br/><br/>""The Mist"" is one of those movies people won't ever want to watch a second time. No, it's not the reason that the movie is bad. It's the fact that this film may take a toll on you. It did to me. I'm pretty sure I'm so emotionally drained from this movie, that I wish I would've never seen this film. ""1408,"" another Stephen King adaptation does the same thing, but not in the same level as this film.<br/><br/>With that as a huge warning before seeing the film, I liked the film a lot. You might've heard things before seeing the movie, like the horrible ending people are keep talking about. Well, the ending could be the most worst thing to have ever happened on screen or the most realistic. I choose realistic. Most would pick the other and I really don't blame them.<br/><br/>One can see a similarity between this film and ""Lord of the Flies."" In fact, I think Stephen King wrote ""The Mist"" inspired by ""Lord of the Flies."" It wouldn't surprise me. Horror movies these days don't include scenes that happen in ""The Mist."" The characters in here are all great, each played well by each cast member. The movie focuses away on the ""things"" outside the mist and focuses more on the ""breaking apart"" of a once civilized population, just like ""Lord of the Flies.""<br/><br/>The violence and gore are still there. There are enough to make a horror fan happy. The special effects are great, in my opinion. Frank Darabont, once again, does not disappoint with a brilliant film. I found the cinematography strange and unique. You'll see why once you see the film. But to anyone who wants to see this film, I am warning you that it's a dark piece of film which portrays everything, in my opinion, realistically, and will emotionally drain you to death."
"Ozzy2000","6","0","3","18 June 2008"," Silly film with quasi religious overtones.
","I am told the ""THE MIST"" in some European languages means garbage in this case the translation applies. Stephen King as usual has turned the normal average Mid -west USA town from one dimensional mediocrity to madness and mayhem within the opening section of the film. Frank Darabont directs the film and after his great films like GREEN MILE this one must be a bit embarrassing. We see a strange mist settle over the town and along with it large array of massive and deadly insects , tentacle bearing monsters and various large deadly and nasty creatures. The protagonist of the film is David Drayton played by Thomas Jane (Punisher, The Thin Red Line) and he goes into town with his son and his African -American neighbour Brent Norton ( Andre Braugher) a Big town Lawyer who turns out to be very unpopular in the town. As the mist and the monsters engulf the town Drayton and his son along with Norton and several other shoppers take refuge in the local supermarket. As the film painfully drags along we find that fear and ignorance of most of the shoppers in the Supermarket become as great a risk the monsters outside. This happens because of a Bible -Bashing woman incites religious fanaticism amongst the shoppers to the extent that she has convinced them that the few unbelievers should be sacrificed to God's monsters that have taken over the earth. Drayton and his level headed crew in the Supermarket find themselves having to escape the mad mob in the supermarket and even having to kill the mad preacher. Drayton and his crew escape in a four wheel drive but a few die in the process as the monsters are everywhere. Eventually Drayton his son and two other survivors become stranded and the consequences are as unrealistic as they are tragic. The characters in this film are as pathetic as the notoriously mediocre M. Night Shyamalan type of films in fact the the religious overtones and style of anti-climatic deadly creatures is very much down at that level."
"fwomp","6","0","1","18 June 2008"," A Mediocre Film Based On A Fantastic Novella
","There has been  and probably will be for some time  speculation about the end of this film and how it strayed from Stephen King's novella by the same name: The Mist. There's good and bad in equal measure, depending upon your stance on Hollywood Horror versus the literary kind. But let's back-up and look at the beginning before we rush to the end...<br/><br/>Equal parts supernatural thriller and science fiction yarn, the novella (published in 1985 in a short story collection entitled Skeleton Crew) was, well, phenomenal. It is the type of story most horror fans associate Stephen King with. Compartmentalized. Freakishly different. Plays on morality. Just flat-out good writing. King did well back in the 70s and 80s, but he has floundered as a writer in recent years with his horribly bad From A Buick 8 and the equally putrid Dreamcatcher (which was made into a very unfortunate film starring Morgan Freeman). What exactly happened to Mr. King, I'm not sure. He hadn't had his brush with death (yet) and his earlier work sent the proverbial chills up my spine (most notably the excellent The Shining and It). Regardless of past or more present works, Mr. King did get lucky with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION in that he got Frank Darabont to write the screenplay and direct. The Shawshank Redemption has been labeled one of the top 100 films of all times by nearly every film critic in the world, and it is one of my top ten favorites. The transfer from book to film went exceptionally well, and this was in no small part thanks to Darabont's work. Darabont did similarly nice work on THE GREEN MILE, but it didn't quite reach the heights that Shawshank did. But when I saw that Darbont was attached to this film, I leapt at the chance to watch it.<br/><br/>Needless to say (because of my cool acceptance rating), I found The Mist to be entertaining but sadly lacking in several areas. But let's start with the good...<br/><br/>The creature effects. The combined work using CGI and stop animation was excellent. KNB EFX Group as the Special Effects crew and CafeFX doing the Visual Effects showed us some eerily nice work. The ominous cloud of mist was perfect enough to shroud any early identification of the creatures within it and the actors reacted to the mist just as you would expect.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden (INTO THE WILD) stars as Mrs. Carmody, the bible-thumping, old-testament wielding, blood-seeking, Christian hypocrite that we all enjoyed in the novella. I hated her in the novella and I hated her here, meaning that Gay Harden pulled off a very good performance.<br/><br/>Any further positives however (save one), get blurred by the ridiculous nature of the scripted characters. Too many times we get the 'shock' effect simply for shock effect, rather than sticking with the compartmentalization of the situation (i.e., people of differing backgrounds at each others' throats in a supermarket during a crisis situation). Characters act as if they are surprised to see death and destruction after it has already been shown to them just a few hours before. People leap for weapons when a creature is nearby ready to skewer them. Main actor Thomas Jane who plays David Drayton could have been played by just about anyone, meaning that I didn't find his portrayal of this character memorable (whereas Gay Harden nailed her role) And the list goes on...<br/><br/>Getting back to the ending  and my final positive note  I have to say that it was hampered somewhat by my enjoyment of the written word versus this visual medium. In the novella, Mr. King leaves the ending fairly ambiguous. Which I liked. I liked a lot. And here, in the film, that gets changed to a much more somber ending. Although I liked the fact that Darabont didn't sugarcoat the final act, I do think he could have kept King's original ending and added a few more fans to his legions. But let's make it perfectly clear that this ending is absolutely in-line with the true horror genre, which is why it got a semi-positive rating from me."

I knew the military would show up after he did it, you can here the helos and jets flying over right before he kills everyone. I was siting there going, no don't do it. I like different endings, but this was just stupid. What was the point of everything they went through, fighting to get out of the store, trying to reach the end of the mist, etc. all to have it end with 4 people dead and him sitting there w/out a bullet to kill himself and then the military drives up.

","Four reasons of why this is a very good thriller:<br/><br/>Number one.- If you know Stephen King's works, you probably know that the man is crazy, so if you listen is name in a movie title, instantly, you can start to expect the worst for the characters, a lot of suspense and an entire-non-sleep-night, so, I wasn't surprised or disappointed. Number two.- I'm already sick of watching the modern thrillers, with stupid characters, stupid lines and stupid scenes... Here you gonna note that every character has is own reason to ruin the day (not the typical ""I'm going to walk into the darkness because I'm brave and stupid and nothing's gonna cut my head off"" without a concrete explanation), here you gonna note true Screenplay. Number three.- It is a very scary, exiting and original story, that let you thinking for a while before you say ""WOW!!!"". I don't remember a King's novel that make me reflect as much as I did with this one, actually, I don't remember if anyone did. Number four.- Beside of being scary, bloody, weird, etc. I love the King's stile and I like the performances from this movie, specially Thomas Jane.<br/><br/>My point is: Stephen King doesn't waste is time. If he want to scare you, he does; If he wan't someone thinking about the human cowardice, with-no-regrets, he does;If he want you awake all night long, he does. But he didn't do it with poorly written novels or stupid ideas, he didn't wrote horror just to sell books, he did it because he knows how to scare or call your attention and he take the time to search the for the right words to make you feel. He is the truly Master Of Horror!!! He don't play with you!!!"

What a kick in the b*lls, what a smack in the jaw as you're left open-mouthed grabbing for some sense of what has just rolled itself over you. It's the ending that makes you see the whole reason you've just let yourself be taken on this journey by King, the ending leaves you breathless, desperate, head shakingly shattered.

The need to change the ending from a group breaking free of the store and making a run for freedom killing themselves when the gas ran out in there 4x4 just before they would have been saved by the almighty army. Granted Some licenses is taken when a movie is made from book but the ending is so different I almost began to laugh.

Good attempt at representing religious zealousness.(Though a little overblown.)<br/><br/>The bad: Some of the characters were not allowed to evolve enough, particularly, Andre Braugher's role. I don't know if he wanted to bow out of the role or what but there was some good chemistry between him and Thomas Jane. The unreality of his role was stupid. The tentacle which dissolved was stupid and seemed to be thrown in to make it impossible for others in the cast to see it which helped the premise of no one believing them in the beginning. And the biggest mistake of this movie was when Thomas Jane assisted suicided the four other survivors with him, not to mention his son.HELLO!! It seems the director wanted this ending so bad he was willing to forget about reality. Lets face it, wouldn't you or any other sane person wait until the monsters were literally moments away from eating you before you killed yourself? Why go to all that work of escape to instantly kill yourself when the truck runs out of gas. Sometimes a little formula is good. The best ending would have been the five survivors being passed by the army vehicles and have one of the people transports have the people from the store in it.

From my point of view, this movie is not talking about the mist that came from another world full with creepy monsters and so on, but it is about the mist in people's minds, and how people are ready to get rid if each other because of a wrong idea they might have, look at ""Mrs. Carmody"" and her wrong understanding of religion make her ready to sacrifice any one because of a silly idea that the GOD want us to sacrifice with blood - this remind me with the old civilizations -, and the biggest problem that almost all the trapped people believed her because just they can't even think for a solution for this situation so they only take the easy and existing one, and they start killing people ""Carmody"" hates !! I also get surprised when ""Drayton"" gave up on the last minute before the mist reveals, if he just wait only 5 more minutes ... he would live happy ever after, but he reached a point that he don't want the mist's creatures attack his own kid, so he killed him !! Overall, I describe this movie - for me - as the second best movie by ""Stephen King"" directly after ""Needful Things"" which also is a great movie about people just hate each other and they only need a spark to start killing each other ..."

","A new genre in the making !, 7 April 2008 8/10 Author: (maximusnorton@gmail.com)<br/><br/>The Mist , the title gives you the ""bwaaah ... naahhh , not for me "" first impression, but as more than once in life I have been shown - ""Not always do first impressions need to be all that great"" ! I thought to myself on first seeing the promo of this movie somewhere, ""God,is it going to be something along the lines of that Tom Welling (Smallville) fiasco, I was like couldn't they come up with something inventive , at least with the title ? 'The Fog' : 'The Mist' ! Old chocolate , new wrapper !"" But at the end of the promo when I saw the words : ' A Francis Darabont film ' , I was intrigued. Why would someone of his caliber want to direct a movie named ""The Mist"" ? It was only later that week, when I was at the airport, I managed to read an interview of his in the ""Empire"" and I realized that 'The Mist' like his previous creations (The Green Mile ,The Shawshank Redemption), was also based on one of Stephen King's works. This fact added to my curiosity and I was dead set on watching the movie as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The movie to be honest is something new, at least in my case: The Director: Francis Darabont is a director, one of the few left, who is still fascinated by the idea of myths and fables with a dollop of mysticism. In this present day world of ""INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY"" or "" EPIC SCALE ANIMALS AND HUMANS ARE FRIENDS AND WE ALL KNOW MAGIC"" movies, here is a director who still wants to make movies based on simple but yet intricately woven tales. Tales that are held together by a sense of mysticism,of powers greater than us. His movies give us a peculiar feeling of mixed emotions, of dread and despair , joy and redemption. All his movies have that redeeming factor,in some way or the other , he manages to put it in there. In this movie, he has only surpassed his previous genius in all matters both technically and script wise. He even used the dynamic camera action used in Shield (The TV series) and also in Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"", to give us that feeling of intense dread of not knowing what is happening and what is about to happen. The zooming technique to heighten the portrayal of emotions and the constant swagger of the camera created an atmosphere of uncertainty, sucking the viewer right in.<br/><br/>The Script: May it be Stephen King's novel or novella or whatever , but the tact with which Francis put it on screen is laudable. I was amazed with the way he put in complexities of problems pertaining to the past , the present and the future. (Race, War, The Old Testament , Scientists playing God etc.) The language used even, was extremely subtle but yet forceful, every character spoke in accordance to their backgrounds.<br/><br/>The Cast: A well chosen group of actors whose on-screen chemistry was excellent, each one sunk into their roles, except maybe for the African American who played the neighbor/lawyer (The guy from the TV show THIEF), his histrionics were quite plain and lacked soul. ( But I guess thats what the world appreciates these days, otherwise why would they have given the Oscar to Daniel Day lewis ?) The Effects: Good,nothing too ""glitzy"". The tentacles were a bit lame though ! The Theme: Here is a one of a kind monster movie, one that creates a new genre, where it can be about monsters but also be pleasing to both sides of the viewing audience namely the intelligentsia and the gore lovers. This movie is an experience and you need to listen and analyze on your own what it means to you and what its trying to tell, its not just about a group of people stuck in a situation they have never seen before, its more about how they tend to handle it and how no matter who we are and where we are from, we will all, in the end, return to our primitive forms when faced with a situation, so intense and life threatening.<br/><br/>Some will emerge as self proclaimed saviors, egocentrics who will use anything from religion to logic to rise above others. While others will quietly do what has to be done. But when faced with bigger choices, we all act the same - There is a scene where a mother asks for help and we get to see that basically, we are all just normal people, normal people who would like to be heroes and make a difference but only when it is convenient to them.<br/><br/>The ending: It has the usual Darabont/M.Night twist ... But this one though obvious to some, does not happen in the usual ""recollect events happened thus far"" format, but actually in a more "" God! What have I done?"" sort of way.<br/><br/>So, is this a monster movie - YES ! but it is also so much more...<br/><br/>My vote: 8 out of 10"

It did however star Thomas Jane who had my eye after great roles in Boogie Nights and The Thin Red Line; but this was also the same TJ who lost my attention after a spectacular string of worthless films. On top of all that, it had Marcia Gay Harden in it and the prospect of staring at her mope face wasn't working to The Mist's advantage.<br/><br/>Five minutes into it, I knew I wasn't watching The Fog. As two hours whisked by, The Mist cheated me out of the perfect ending but it had earned my respect. Despite laughably bad CGI, a few dead spots killed by on-the-nose dialogue and characters a little too quick to propel the plot in a dire direction, The Mist delivered where most cookie cutter horror films don't. It wasn't completely predictable, it wasn't utterly mindless and it understood the two basic tenets of all good horror: mood and atmosphere. I haven't read the SK novella so I can't comment on whether the screenplay took its own liberties or not, but a lot of what was happening and being said provided the audience with a sub textual narrative critiquing religious fanaticism and fear mongering. The present day neo-con landscape is one where both fear and religion play pivotal roles in our daily lives and Darabont pulls no punches showing how these two societal cancers can and will lead us down a path of self destruction.<br/><br/>The writing isn't brilliant social commentary and at times it suffers from being a bit too obvious. Nevertheless Darabont manages to get across a timely and relevant message without betraying the story and because he's able to pull off this delicate act, he elevates The Mist above the crowd of mindless horror clones dropping into theaters every few weeks. He also has to be commended for the brilliant casting of Gay Harden as a typical fundamentalist nut bag that you would personally love to shut up with a hollow point kiss. Fortunately for us, someone does in the most splendid of ways.<br/><br/>Lastly, The Mist almost ends perfectly, yet instead opts for a denouement that is tragic, ironic and, ultimately, predictable. Something tells me this ending was penned by SK who probably patted himself on the back for having the ability to write something ironic.<br/><br/>http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/"

","The actors in this movie were pretty good at making their characters feel ""real"" and gave some very good performances. Unfortunately, the characters are ridiculously stereotypical and one-dimensional. By the end, the movie comes off as a badly crafted piece of propaganda where the director attacks every social group he doesn't like in the most unsubtle way possible. Its obvious Stephen King is from the ""baby-boomer"" generation, since this movie so represents the thinking of that generation. Christians (surprise surprise) are stereotyped the most in this movie. If you can't stand anti-Christian propaganda I suggest you skip this one.<br/><br/>After a thrilling 30 minute start, the movie soon devolves into a bad commentary on the values of evangelical Christians versus the values of secular people. The movie constantly perpetuates the idea that people believe in God because they are anti-intellectual and afraid of death. Actually, a true intellectual will believe in God because it is completely reasonable and logical to do so. There are more logical proofs for the existence God than against it.<br/><br/>That having been said, I did find the movie to be fairly scary and suspenseful. If you can ignore the obvious agenda of the writer and/or director, then it is actually quite entertaining."

Let me tell you now, in a situation like this the reactions will depend on peoples ability to understand the depth of the situation they are in and whether they can think things through and make decisions in a logical way. I have served on jury service and can tell you first hand that there are such people that can be as easily lead as the characters in the store and there are also people who cannot accept things unless there is ironclad proof. I have in life been amazed at times at the inability of people to act in a rational manner in varied situations.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be quite realistic, however I was not impressed with the creatures or the ridiculous premise with portals from other dimensions having been opened by the military letting these creatures run amok.

"Bunuel1976","7","0","1","23 April 2008"," THE MIST (Frank Darabont, 2007) ***
","Of the 108 Stephen King adaptations for film or TV, I am only familiar with a handful of them – 16 to be exact (counting also the film under review). Frank Darabont joins a list of remarkable past alumni (Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, John Carpenter) with this well-crafted monster movie with pretensions. Actually, Darabont is no newcomer to Stephen King territory – having already based three of his four feature-length movies on his work! – but this is the first movie I’ve seen from the director and, perhaps significantly, the only one of the three which is horror-related.<br/><br/>Frankly, I wasn’t even aware of the film at all before reviews of its DVD release started cropping up on the Internet. As far as I can recall, it has not yet been released theatrically over here but, perhaps the name Stephen King (because of rampant overexposure over the years) nowadays no longer enjoys the same crowd-pulling effect as it did during his heyday. Still, judging by that modest crowd of actors assembled for the film and its clearly intentional “realism” (read a flat, made-for-TV look and relatively restrained gore), the film-makers hardly endeavored to boost its box-office chances any. Besides, we have lately been literally invaded by monster/alien movies so that it isn’t hard for one (even as solid as this one is) to get lost in the shuffle.<br/><br/>A small seaside American town wakes up one morning to find itself enveloped in a mysterious cloud of thick mist. Soon enough, it becomes abundantly evident that this houses a barrage of slimy, unnaturally-enlarged and very deadly creatures of the bugs variety. To this tried-and-tested formula, Darabont and King add other much-used elements (religious fanaticism, military incompetence, scientific experimentation, impending apolcalypse, etc.) but take them beyond their bleakest and most ironic possibilities. The last half-hour, in fact, is where the film gets all choked up in message-mongering – complete with an overwhelmingly melancholic score which seemed more appropriate accompaniment to a depiction of Christ’s Cruxifiction (or something heavy and solemn like that). Indeed, learning that Darabont has even “presented” his own original black-and-white vision (as opposed to version) of this film on DVD only adds smoke to the fiery theory that this was intended from the start to be much more than a mere monster movie. Despite good work all around and the best intentions, THE BIRDS (1963), it certainly ain’t...<br/><br/>Anyhow, the festering tensions between the diverse factions trapped (for most of the film) inside a supermarket and the inherent suspense present in the group’s generally unsuccessful excursions on the “outside” are skillfully handled and, despite the anonymity of the actors involved, some of the townspeople are blessed with full-blooded characterizations, most prominently Marcia Gay Harden (as the unbalanced, ultra-religious spinster who, after being derided for the longest time, manages to whip the crowd into a veritable frenzy when things start to go very badly for the heroic few) and William Sadler (as a bigoted redneck who cracks up after having a close encounter with the bugs and witnessing the extensiveness of their devastation)."

When almost every horror movie has these screaming and 'oh-so-scary' monsters made with computer - it makes me miss those good old 'man-in-the-rubber-suite' monsters - they had at least some personality! Creature from Black Lagoon is much more scarier than these funny spider from the Mist.<br/><br/>The Mist also tried to depict human drama in closed environment - didn't succeed. Better films in that category are Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Dawn of the Dead (2004) just as examples. Biggest problem was the bad script and too much mundane monster FX.<br/><br/>The Mist is very much like the Fog (1980) - only difference is that the Fog had better monsters - zombie-lepers!!! - and of cause Rob Bottin as the main creeper."
"BeDrinkable","6","0","1","19 April 2008"," Not too darned bad ...
","Adaptations of books are almost never up to the same quality as the source material, which is why this movie pleasantly surprised me.<br/><br/>Horror or shock movies seem to work best before the big *reveal*. Once the creature, or alien or whatever is shown on screen, there is an unavoidable disappointment, because what the human imagination creates is almost always more terrifying that what appears on screen. Jaws being a prime example. Scary as heck when all you see is someone being pulled under water; not so scary when you're watching a mechanical shark munch on a boat.<br/><br/>This story, by its very nature, rarely encounters this. Mist hides rather than reveals, which gives the movie makers ample opportunities for things to jump out and grab someone, just to vanish again. It works best when sticking to this formula.<br/><br/>There is also an interesting psychological component to the story, taken straight from the novella. Everyone is under intense strain and everyone reacts to it in different ways, with most people grasping what little control they still have. Marcia Gay Harden portrays a bible thumping lunatic (one of Stephen King's favorite caricatures) who convinces a number of others that this is the end of days and that they need to make right with God. Another group is positive that there are no creatures in the mist and that the others are scaring themselves into delusion. This exploration helps move the movie beyond the standard kill/die/survive themes of most modern horror.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect. The momentum does flag a bit in the middle and the when the makers do show the monsters, they reek of CGI. And then the much talked about ending. I should mention that I was very fond of the non-ending that King penned, so I may be a bit biased, but the movie seemed to try too hard for a ""you'll never see this coming!"" Unfortunately I did."
"fmcchris","3","0","2","17 April 2008"," An illogical outing into the mist
","Mix in one part provincial town, one part alien monsters, a demented religious woman, some tentacles, a government scientific lab conducting possible life-threatening experiments unknown to the townspeople, and a bunch of people eager to cast away a lifetime of moral convictions to blindly follow the above mentioned religious nut, and you've got ""The Mist"".<br/><br/>Fantasy or not, if a story's premise and characters are based upon anything other than logical motivation, then you end up with melodrama, not drama. And this absurd potboiler evinces all the hallmarks of an incoherently written script. Yes, I know that we all act illogically sometimes; we let our emotions carry us away. However, even the most emotionally charged acts must have their basis in truth--the truth of the premise, and the truth of the characters. When we are constantly second-guessing a character's motivations, then truth has been sublimated to whim or license. This does not produce superb storytelling. I will use only one example to emphasize my point.<br/><br/>One of the more distasteful of these lapses in logic occurs when the majority of the people in the supermarket abandon their reason to slavishly follow and obey the dictates of Mrs. Carmody, a raging, religious lunatic. Yes, alien monsters that appear intent on destroying them besiege the people and they are fighting for their lives. But why are they so quick to forsake their personal ethics to mindlessly obey the commands of an Old Testament-quoting, ""fire and brimstone,"" self-appointed, religious nut who is unquestionably a psychopath? The people in the store are not a group of fundamentalists who may possibly be swayed by such ranting, and even if they were, why eagerly surrender your reason and morals to carry out this woman's demented plans? Who the hell is she that she can claim such slavish devotion? Does she, and only she, have a direct link to the Almighty? The majority of the people in the store seem to think so. I say ""Bah humbug!"" The mob killing of Private Jessup, committed under the instigation of Mrs. Carmody, was nothing more than cold-blooded murder. Are we to believe that in this small town, where many people presumably know one another, all logic and moral decency are thrown out the window so that an innocent man must be killed in order to satisfy the blood lust of a demented woman? And if that is not enough, what about David Drayton's young son, Billy? Well, seeing that the aliens are still present, Mrs. Carmody decides that maybe it's time for the kid to go too--an Abraham-esquire sacrifice to a god whom seems decidedly disinterested in the fates of these terrified humans.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was depressingly anticlimactic. Escaping the clutches of the lunatic crowd, David Drayton, his son, and three others get into a car and drive off into the mist--until they run out of fuel. Seeing a humongous alien monstrosity wade across their path, and believing that they will soon end up as alien fodder, they mutually agree to terminate their lives. The only survivor of this massacre, David Drayton, lives to see the mist dissipate, revealing soldiers in the act of cleaning up after the alien invasion. All he can do is look upon the dead bodies in the car and weep. Had he waited only a few minutes more, his son, and the others, would have lived to see the end of the alien invasion. If I were David Drayton, I might have not been so keen to end these people's lives, especially that of my own son, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, there was a chance for life. It is manipulation of the highest order and most disagreeable. This ending encapsulates for me all the intrinsic logical faults that appear to plague this movie. For although some of the acting and special effects are good, they cannot compensate for what is, essentially, an illogical outing into the mist."
"charchuk","4","0","2","17 April 2008"," Amateurish and overwrought
","This is one of the most overrated films of the year, and it's certainly not one of the best horrors of any timeframe. The creature designs are cool, and I guess the acting is fine enough, but the whole thing looks really shoddily put together. Aside from that great, atmospheric opening shot (loved the nod to The Thing), the camera work is really amateurish and made-for-TV (not surprising, considering they used a TV crew). Darabont should have either gone for a really raw, documentary feel (a la Cloverfield) or a painterly, stylish look, not some half-hearted hybrid. Plus the special effects are pretty bad.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that the characterizations are terribly one-note and not convincing at all. Instead of real people, we're stuck with some stock stereotypes and unbelievable characters, so there's no sense of emotion when any of them die. Marcia Gay Harden couldn't have been any more one-sided if she tried. And the film's message is hammered home with such force that I'm surprised they didn't start invoking Lord of the Flies near the end.<br/><br/>I spoiled myself on the ending, so it really didn't shock me like it should (or could) have, but I really didn't find it effective regardless. It's rushed, it's silly, and it turns borderline hilarious with Thomas Jane's anguished screams. Best horror ending, I think not.<br/><br/>Save your time (and money) and go watch The Shining again."

The plot seemed solid, the acting was very convincing, and the place the movie was set in gave it a very claustrophobic feeling.

","A small town (the type that supposedly don't exist anymore) is menaced by a supernatural mist loaded with monsters, forcing its residents and few out of towners to haul up inside the local grocery store.

If he has done this in another movie so graphically, then I must have missed it.<br/><br/>The movie was brilliantly done keeping you in suspense throughout the whole movie.

","I tried watching this film as objectively as possible, as if having no prior knowledge. In that sense I think the movie was fair, but nothing spectacular. However, I've got the audio cassette I bought back in the '80s, which was an experimental recording called, the ""Kunstkoph"" binaural sound. It was great to listen to, but thought it was most convenient to take place in a supermarket. I think they plugged every brand good in the store (which was probably the intention).<br/><br/>All of this aside, I didn't find the film all that satisfying. I wasn't thrilled that much, probably influenced by the tape that I tried to ignore. Nevertheless, if you can appreciate so-so horror films, e.g, 'The Host', then the movie is fairly watchable. There were times in the middle things became slow and predictable, and nearly fell asleep. Unlike the cassette, the ending was super. Too bad the rest of the movie didn't measure up to it.<br/><br/>As for monsters (which we all look for), they left a lot to be desired. As a collector of over 5,000 titles I've seen far much better. As for the story, it wasn't that gripping, (except, maybe from a philosophical aspect).<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are easily entertained you may enjoy it, otherwise if you miss it, you're not missing much.

","I'm a big fan of Mr King's books. Movies based on his books though? Not so much. People get them wrong and screw them up and I wasn't expecting this to be any different.<br/><br/>The film starts VERY slowly, we get a little bit of character development, learn about some character relationships as well. Then the sirens start going and we get our 1st warning about The Mist and that someone has already been got!<br/><br/>We also have the 1st person to run for freedom to his car and once he's covered by the very fast moving Mist all we then hear is screaming. Generally the film likes to lead you by the nose as if your really stupid or actually retarded.<br/><br/>Stuff like showing us the fireaxe on the wall as Norm gets grabbed by the tentacle. I don't need the film-maker to tell me what he's going to be doing in a few moments. I can watch it for myself, I'm intelligent enough to actually watch a movie.<br/><br/>Obviously Norm was going to die but the monsters looked like very bad CGI and not much money was spent creating those shots. The 1st law of horror, hide your monsters for as long as possible then show as little as you can, revealing tiny bits until you see the whole thing near the end. That's been thrown right out of the window as we got to see the tentacles very early.<br/><br/>Obviously opposing groups are formed and the group that wants to leave does so (I'm amazed that not one of them carries a torch into The Mist to try and see any better?) but their all killed (the scene with the rope is pretty cool!) and the religious nut that has already been scaring folks and preaching the end of the world is just fired up even more by this occurrence.<br/><br/>Once night starts to fall we see our 2nd type of monster (the dragonfly thing) and the even bigger dragon thing. Sadly these monsters suffer the same CGI issues as the tentacles they just don't look very real (especially the dragons & even more so when their on fire & flying).<br/><br/>Although David & his son are fighting for their lives what shocks & amazes me is neither of them have expressed concerned for mom at home all on her own and this is halfway through the movie!<br/><br/>When David's group go out for medical supplies their intelligent enough to take torches with them. Here we meet the spider monsters (How did they not spot the web stuff all over the columns before they ever found the MP?) & they steal a page right out of Aliens with monsters using live human hosts to incubate their young.<br/><br/>Eventually we find out the monsters and The Mist are all the fault of the military doing some experiment on a local base and its all from another dimension.<br/><br/>Once most of David's group reached the truck I did wonder how they were going to stretch the movie at least another 10 minutes. Going back to David's home its covered in the webs and we see the wife cocooned and they decide to see if they can drive out of The Mist on what fuel David has left. Obviously they run out gas and start to contemplate suicide but only have 4 bullets to kill 5 people (obviously someone would sit with the little boy in front of them and kill 2 with 1 shot).<br/><br/>This slows down the movie at the wrong place, right now we either want resolution or confrontation and this lull was a really bad idea. Pulling away from the truck we see 4 shots fired then going back inside we see only David left alive who gets out obviously wanting to be killed by what's in The Mist.<br/><br/>I'm not going to describe the ending but I can't remember the book well enough to know if that's the same ending or not but it's a pretty dire and weak ending. It's not much of a resolution at all in my opinion and quite an incredible cop-out considering the effort and time that was spent on the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Not recommended even to King fans."

Personally I found it so hard to connect with any of the characters that I had to look at the DVD box for their names and even then I didn't care.<br/><br/>Let me sum up the plot for you if you're considering wasting your time or money on this thing.<br/><br/>Man with dubious relationship to wife and child goes shopping the day after a storm. Fog rolls in and death comes with it. Something with tentacles eats the world's dumbest bag-boy and five-minutes later anarchy and religion break out. A couple of deaths later and a brave group heads into the mist in a 4x4. They drive for about five more minutes before they run out of gas and off themselves - mostly.<br/><br/>The film isn't a total loss, the monsters look creepy enough and the mist is scary in it's ominous fogginess but there really isn't a lot here to keep your attention. The characters are little more than shadows of archetypes who stray so far from the obvious that a GPS and a trail of crumbs couldn't lead them back to reason.<br/><br/>If you truly want to see a masterful work of tentacled horror then rent Tremors. No stupid fog, no ridiculous alternate-reality, no insipid actors mouthing lines that put even them asleep."

","No, I won't give away the ending, but let's just say that it ended exactly like I hoped it would. Just imagine what's going through the mind of that character...<br/><br/>I haven't read the novella by King, but judging from this movie there wasn't enough meat in that short story to last a full two hour movie. It started out okay, but after a while it started to become a bit dull.<br/><br/>Considering that it's a fairly new movie, it has some of the worst special effects I have ever seen (The Langoliers, another King fare, comes to mind), which is either a result of a poor budget or shoddy craftsmanship by the CG artists. I think that the major mistake that they do is showing too much of the monsters, and way too often. Just think of Jaws or Alien, where we barely see the monsters (it you can call a shark monster), but they are a whole lot more suspenseful than this movie.<br/><br/>In fact, the look and feel of the entire movie screams of low budget. I know, 18 million isn't a whole lot of dough, but there are ways to stretch a dollar to make it feel like a bigger budget. The Usual Suspects, which had a budget of 6 million, is just one example (although admittedly that movie isn't special effects-laden). One of Darabont's previous films, The Shawshank Redemption, was made for only 25 million, and that's a period piece, which isn't exactly cheap.<br/><br/>For the life of me, I can't understand why this movie's got a 7.6 rating. Maybe it's the ending. Judging the movie by the last ten minutes, I would easily give it an 8, but looking at the whole thing, it's not worth more than 3."

","I'll try to explain you why I gave 7 out of 10 on this movie, without telling you any big spoilers- just a small one :) It's really a good horror movie, I would say the best in the past few years. There were action, intense, everything was really great and I was ready to give the movie 9, which is really rare for me. My normal rating for the good movies is 7 (when the film is nothing extraordinary). Back to the movie- the plot was interesting, too. What was the problem? OK. Let's say that the ending was not convincing enough. I cannot realize why the hell they didn't try to take fuel from the other cars on the road. There were 5 people (OK 4 and a little boy) and none of them didn't suggest to take more fuel. The ending though is really good, especially for a horror movie. The only problem was that the audience is not deep enough in the movie to take the same decision. And thus, a great movie with a ""good"" ending is spoiled, just because the logic line is a bit cut. The audience and the actors are not on the same channel. That movie needs so little to be a masterpiece. In the end, I highly recommend the movie to any person with good nerves, who is above 18 years old :)"

","Well I know why this movie moved thru my area so fast. It could have been a great movie but the ending spoiled it all for me. It could have been a great action/alien movie or a great horror movie. Yes I read the story it came from but I don't remember how it ended. too many things that could have been done one way or another were done neither way. So instead of a real horror movie or an sci-fi action movie it just went flop at the end with an ending so horrible and useless that all you feel is bad after you watch it. I recommend everyone skip this one and i think everyone who saw it did the same thing. That's why it went to video so quick. If you do watch prepare to be disgusted at the end. why can't these movie directors, writers or whoever just give us a good movie to watch? Why do they have to start screwin around with crappy endings just to be ""different""? They'd make a lot more money and the public would go see a lot more movies."

","I've labeled this to contain spoilers, though I will make a point to try not to.<br/><br/>To begin, I have not read the novella in which the movie was based. I don't know if anything was left out, or added. What I can say is that from the moment they enter town, I was gripped. There was a level of human drama that not that many movies, at least as far as creature-features go, achieve. Almost immediately I began to feel the sense of worry that Drayton had for his wife. Even the brief scene with the woman worried about her children. With so little background on the characters, you could already begin to empathize with them.<br/><br/>The CGI used for the creatures was well done, though was very particularly noticeable in some scenes more than others. But overall, quite good. Oddly enough, some of the flying creatures movements looked more stop-animation that CGI.<br/><br/>I think the only point in the story that really killed it for me was the very brief description of where the creatures and mist came from. I liked the idea, at least it wasn't exactly supernatural, but the way it was delivered was just really 1950's B-Movie to me. I think even just some rewording of it would have helped. Granted the character delivering the information was supposed to be unaware of the details, but still it just kind of made everything after that a little 'cheesy' for me.<br/><br/>The ending was certainly good, but admittedly it wasn't exactly unexpected. By time they were in the car, I figured there two possible endings. That was one of them. I think the story can be summarized as a mixture of The Lord of the Flies and The Twilight Zone.<br/><br/>As I mentioned it was hard for me to take it too seriously after the origin was revealed and the fact that the end was a bit predictable didn't help. That said, I still find myself thinking about the movie. The ending, the characters, the situation; everything. I find myself replaying a lot of the scenes over in my head. I think that is was made it a very successful film to me."

","Very good suspense movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat most of the time. The characters are sympathetic and believable, the creatures are pretty frightening. There is a good deal of gore. The human-behavior-under-extreme-circumstances concept is well exploited. There are some plot holes that can be forgiven because they work in favor of the suspense. My only big complain would be the end. Tom Jane shoots dead his 3 runaway friends and HIS OWN SON as soon as they run out of gas on the road. This is a guy who shows a great bravery and hope all along despite their difficult situation and looses it in a minute when they get stuck on the road even though there is no imminent danger right in front of them. Simply not believable. And even worse, as soon as he gets out the car in desperation to get himself killed by one of the creatures, the sky clears up and salvation shows up with some military guys. Cheap unnecessary soap opera drama that just don't fit and partly spoils the good story that had been constructed."
"Dark_Venom","7","0","1","14 March 2008"," The best horror-adaptation of a King-story, spoiled by the silliest ending imaginable
","Let's be straight with this one. No one ever but Frank Darabont should direct Stephen King's stories. Dot. Having been to Shawshank, walked across The Green Mile, this man leads us once more to the dark realm of the living author-legend, and introduces us to The Mist. After tons of failed attempts -yes, even 1408-, up until The Mist's last minutes, I had thought: the best adaptation ever from a King novel. The suspense, the characters, the actors, the faith and heart put in the movie makes it far more than a usual horror. It makes us scared to death of the unknown. We feel surrounded, powerless, and we just count our heartbeats to know whether it's the last one or no. I haven't imagined it to be this great. And then, in the last two minutes, Darabont acts like an idiot: destroys everything that he has built. Destroys the meanings, the uncertainty, the fear, the hopelessness. He comes up with the silliest, unforgettably stupid ending that I've seen since The War of the Worlds. No, I have no problem with David killing all the survivors in his hopelessness, and no, I have no problem with him being the last man to face his fate. The stupidity lies in the sudden disappearance of the mist, in the army coming out of nowhere, and the trucks loaded with dozens of survivors. These images ruined all the fear of the mist, makes all sense disappear, and makes us say ""no way, dude, this is just utterly crap"". Where has the military been all the time? How come the mist disappears just from one minute to the other? And the mother from the beginning? Come on, people couldn't make 300 yards from the store, but she ends up being saved? And why should we leave the cinema with the feeling that the only man who could be sane through the movie ends up being the one who made a wrong decision? This makes no sense, and the scene, him shouting on his knees when the military drives by, looked definitely ridiculous. And what's the point? ""Davey you should have waited 10 minutes with killing off everyone in your hopelessness, because the military just stopped the mist, and is marching towards you""? Silly. So, I still feel positive about the movie as a whole, only disappointment remains in me. The novella's uncertain, interpretable ending would have fitted in this, from every other perspective the best, adaptation. I'm sorry."

"pyx","7","0","1","9 March 2008"," Fantastic version, lousy ending
","So much of King's writing is about the back-story and what goes on in peoples' heads that it takes a special kind of sensitivity to the writer's intent to do justice, which is why most movie versions fail so dismally.<br/><br/>The Mist is a much more straight-forward story, about suspense, monsters, and mad science, so it translated well, especially in the age of easy CGI.<br/><br/>That said, the director really did credit to what is probably my favourite King story, faithfully recreating the nuances and making the characters believable. I was particularly pleased that the Director retained the giant creature near the end, which was even better than my imagined creature. I also felt that the spiders in the pharmacy had an evil intent and believability that far exceeded my imagination, especially the way that the webs were launched. Mrs Carmody's homicidal and insane religious loon was made all too plausible as well.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but was disgusted by the deliberately anti-Hollywood ending, in which the hero actually kills his little boy and fellow escapees to save them from the monsters (which subsequently don't appear) moments before rescue arrives.<br/><br/>I'm bewildered as to why what was an exceedingly ambiguous but neutral ending in the book had to be made so irredeemably horrific, shame on King for allowing it.<br/><br/>When I see a hateful ending like this, I have to wonder at the director's mind. Is he so far gone that he feels killing children and old people as the climax is the only way to ""keep it real""? What possible point was he trying to make?<br/><br/>So much better than most King adaptations"

True some of the special effects could have been done abit more realistically, putting humanesque facial features on creatures can never look realistic regardless how well done,and although this is probably just a personal complaint i for one hate the bible preaching fanatics that pop up in such times of doom and take whatever catastrophe is at hand to be the work of God (and then spend ages preaching about it when something more interesting could have been added to the film instead,)but that apart was well impressed and very happy i had the opportunity to see it.<br/><br/>worth a good 8 out of 10 for effort,7 out of 10 if i dock a point for being annoyed and bored during bible quotations, but actually gave it 9 out of 10 due to fact that much as hate preachers in films,its probably realistic in such settings and besides which i was too happy i'd seen it to give a bad mark heh"

The story is far from original, it's the doomsday/apocalypse stuff all over again. But those, to me at least, are always interesting.<br/><br/>At first this movie seemed almost like a made for TV one, with no known actors and a seemingly low budget. However, as time went by, the movie got better, which is quite rare. The special effects aren't necessarily top notch, but they do their job. Acting by most people was quite weak as well, except for Marcia Gay Harden.<br/><br/>I liked the attack on religion, or religious zealots, as it's quite rare in an American movie. I think the movie wanted to have a big message(TM), but it sort of delivered it in this B-movie style. The characters aren't very deep, but I think the way the people reacted is pretty believable. Who knows how you would react in a situation like this? It's quite clear this was written in 1980, and the story would have needed some restructuring to be more believable. There wasn't a single computer in the store with Internet? No one desperately twiddling their mobile phones? The ending... well it's hard to say anything about it without spoiling, but it's certainly shocking. I'm a bit divided if I actually liked it or not. But it certainly ain't no Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>This ain't a typical horror movie of today. There's some gore but not that much. There's virtually no ""jump"" scares. It's quite refreshing actually. The scares are more in the psychological level.

But after all it was from the guys that brought us The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Miles. So it’s expected to be good.<br/><br/>Synopsis: After a sudden mist covered the whole town. The customers in the small grocery store find themselves trapped. Tension increase as they believe monsters is lurking outside the store.<br/><br/>Like its tagline this movie is solely base on fear and how human will actually react in this kind of situation. It’s more real than most monster movie that out there; Steven Spielberg tried to do it as in Wars of the World but didn’t come close to this. In this you will feel the fear and frustration.<br/><br/>I enjoy how it cut he chase and find oneself in the store the next. The pace of the movie is awesome. But there should be more of a character development; I feel I hardly know any of them. But some character is beyond noticeable; you will feel everything and what they go through.<br/><br/>Well, I was surprise at the casting actually. Thomas Jane, I love that guy since I saw him back in Deep Blue Sea, but for me frankly didn’t quite work here, and I feel the movie would be more dramatic if used more serious actor. The other actors are also, my opinion, not suited for this type of movie.<br/><br/>I also love the score in this film, very chilling and go with the movie really well. As for the visual effect, this is utterly awesome, awesome, each monsters is full of detail and blend in with the atmosphere of the movie. Well I’m not getting much into directing and lighting, it’s Frank so it’s good; you know that I know that.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a realistic psychological thriller that will drive you to the edge of your seat from the beginning to the very end.

I have no problem with reading them over and over. However, every movie ever made based on one of his stories has turned out to be a disappointment. Most of these bombers can be put down to the simple impossibility of putting all of the detail from the book onto the screen. A few titles, especially this one, cannot be salvaged. There are, however, a few minor bits and pieces that make it bearable to sit through...once. First, the creatures are very interesting and left you wondering what would come next. They are just creepy enough to be distracting from the awfulness of the movie. Also, I have to say that I actually appreciate the fact that the movie doesn't address where the mist came from. Not only does it leave the viewer trying to draw his own conclusions, but in the real world, this fact would probably not be unveiled until weeks or months after the fact. At this point, with the available ending, I don't think that the main character would really care. If nothing else, the movie sticks to its guns.<br/><br/>Overall, a bad movie with a few good bits.

While I won't harp on about CGI and production values because they aren't essential to the quality of a movie and its impact, this movie could be much better on other fronts.<br/><br/>The film makers tried to go in several different ways in this movie, and really none of them are all that successful. I won't give away any spoilers, but if you have seen the trailer, you know that the movie explores human survival instinct and their tendency to turn against each other, and this is realized through several events. The problem is, even if you have not seen any trailers, this is foreshadowed from the beginning, and it all happens in too short a time frame. It's just not convincing, thanks in no small part to the mediocre acting especially from the lead role and the crazy fanatic woman. It is commented on within the dialogue that the speed in which human will turn against each other is frightening, but the exploration of this concept is also a big fail.<br/><br/>Apart from these various subplots, the movie does provide some good scenes of suspense, some nice jump from your seat shocks, and also nice creature design (the spiders are my favourite).<br/><br/>What was disappointing is the ending, which I won't reveal due to spoilers, but it left me feeling cheated. Once again, I could see where they were trying to go with this kind of ending, but once again, it doesn't meld well with the kind of movie that this is, and my advice to filmmakers is that this sort of ending that is meant to be meaningful is much better left to less B-movie films, such as No Country for Old men, which was much better, and executed this kind of thing well.<br/><br/>Over all, fairly good but mildly disappointing."

","First of all: I love films, I watch as many as I can and it's one of my biggest interests. My taste in movies range from heavy dramas to cheap horror B-flicks. <br/><br/>Second: I read the short novel for The Mist when I was 13 I think and I never forgot about it. There was something really chilling in that part in the beginning with the man shouting ""There is something in the mist!"". Without even knowing it I had anxiously awaited the film version of it. My friend had come over a cam-recorded pirate and I was like: Hell NO! I have to see it on the big screen! So, finally there's a movie I'm dying to see, but there is no opening date for Sweden as far as I'm concerned... why? It seems this movie will be a straight-to-DVD release in Sweden...<br/><br/>Anyway, after reading the reviews here on IMDb i was intrigued on how it divides people, those ho hated it and those who loved it. And I knew right then and there I had to watch it! I had to make my own decision. So I watched the cam-pirate... And I loved it! I was really into the movie and I thought the creatures looked and felt real and I think it has all the chills of the novel. And the ending? I did NOT see it coming. I was actually shocked. It was GREAT! This is a fine horror film which sadly many will miss, I don't think its marketed well enough. Hopefully it will have it's revenge on DVD.<br/><br/>Mind you, had I seen this in a proper cinema, my rating would be higher..."

","Stephen King's The Mist is so much more than just an action-horror story. Trapped in a supermarket, surrounded by flying and slithering horrors of unknown origin, a community of people who should be working together for mutual survival instead splits into dangerous, internecine factions. Strong personalities assert themselves to achieve dominance whether they are right or not. Flat Earth denialists are willing to risk everything to prove to the group that nothing is actually wrong, when clearly something VERY wrong is going on. A local religious nutcase becomes a charismatic tyrant, exploiting fear to spread her twisted version of the Old Testament. Logic and social accountability go out the window to be replaced by selfishness and power-grabbing. It is human politics and religion in miniature, as well as a glimpse at how close supposedly civilized humanity is to descending into primitivism and savagery that makes Lord of the Flies look like a Victorian tea party. It is to Frank Darabont's credit that his adaptation left alone much of the structure of King's novel, while giving the exercise a nice other-worldly cinematic look. The film is shot in bled-out colors, giving the world within the Mist and the characters themselves a cheerless, hopeless appearance. The monsters themselves are suitably strange and ugly and lethal, and the ensemble cast, which ranges from highly effective (Marcia Gay Harden) to barely adequate (Thomas Jane), manages to successfully impart the appropriate air of menace and hopelessness the situation requires. It should be noted that, while the film follows the progression of the novel reasonably faithfully for most of its length, the revised ending may leave fans of the book irritated. The overall viewing experience is worthwhile, but I would recommend that fans of the book leave right when the novel itself ends. The tacked-on ending will have you frustrated."

"3xHCCH","7","0","2","7 February 2008"," An All-Genre Modern Horror Classic
","After suffering though a bad horror movie (""One Missed Call""), finally I get to watch a great one. The pedigree is there as this is derived from a Stephen King novella, and directed by Frank Darabont. One of my favorite movies of all time is ""The Shawshank Redemption"", which came with similar credentials.<br/><br/>A severe storm causes a mist to form around a Maine township. The main characters are trapped in a supermarket as this mist carries with it abominable monsters that seek to devour the populace. I know what you are thinking, that sounds like the plot a lame B-movie. However, in the hands of the director, writers and actors, this was translated into a chilling and disturbing morality play that transcends the baseness of the plot.<br/><br/>The movie follows main character David Drayton (played by Thomas Jane) as he brings his young son to the local supermarket to buy supplies after the storm. While they were inside, strange mist envelopes everything in town around them. Later it becomes obvious that the mist is not as innocent as it seems. There are blood-thirsty monsters that dwell in it, so no one could get out.<br/><br/>As expected, the longer they stayed trapped inside the supermarket, tensions began to rise as Drayton begins to have conflicts among the other townspeople with strong personalities . There was a lawyer Mr. Norton (Andre Braugher) who did not believe the monsters exist. And above all, there was Mrs. Carmody (sinisterly played by Marcia Gay Harden, in full camp), an unstable fire-and-brimstone religious fanatic. The tumultuous and violent interactions of these characters are so realistically palpable, that the audience is drawn into their difficult situation, fantastic as it maybe.<br/><br/>The tension is held throughout the two hours of screen time until the unbelievable climax. The ending is one that will disturb and haunt you. You will never forget it. (Not that I necessarily agree with what they decided to do...)<br/><br/>""This Mist"" is an all-genre film. Aside from the blood and gore, there were scenes of heart-pounding action, drama, sci-fi, and even philosophical discussions, as well as religious ranting and persecution. This certainly lifts it beyond the run of the mill horror flick, and I would consider this a modern classic of the genre, together with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others"". Well recommended for lovers of horror films, like me."

","The story and the atmosphere a film creates are the most important criteria to me. This movie takes more or less ordinary people and puts them into a totally uncontrolled situation. This seems to be an old pattern but this movie takes it further. Instead of just having some heroes encountering some problems on their way out, the film puts a special focus on the negative, insane sides that break through when a seemingly civilized human being is caught in such a situation. As I have already mentioned, the atmosphere is very important to me. When did you hear people clapping at the end of a scene the last time? Well I made this experience today. The Mist is such a intense trip between insanity and reason, between viewer's satisfaction and frustration, between jokes and dramatic elements. It takes you on a thrilling trip through human psyche. I loved this movie! <br/><br/>Well, there's a little thing I want to add: Sometimes I think the actors were overextended with their parts, except for Marcia Gay Haredn who acts fantastically in her role as Mrs. Carmody. This leads to cheesy moments once in a while. That's reason why I gave 9/10 stars.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth it's money!"

How could you sum up what happened in the US during the past 7 years any better ? A nice movie so far, but now the parts that are not that good... Maybe it's a bit conservative, but i don't believe a good horror movie's made of fancy animations (and by the way, in this movie they SUCK) or big and evil monsters. It's supsence, suspense that makes a good horror movie. And suspense is the exact thing this movie hasn't got. Several bloody slaughter scenes, some anxious shock moments.. don't get me wrong, i like splatter movies, but this ain't one... the one thing that doesn't make me give this movie a 5 or worse, is the ending... boy, what an ending! don't wanna spoiler it, but i'd say the movie is worth watching because of the ending alone.."

Though the development of the story and characters are better here, more fully developed, however it's undoing is it's not actually very scary. It could be scary, it's got all the potential for Lovecraft-like nightmarishness, but it remained as Jurassic Park by way of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"", with a twist at the end, and it could have been more. The workings of faith versus the unknown are bold, especially in our current political climate, this theme holds up the story beyond a lot of recent horror, sf, and fantasy, it just only goes so far, the gas runs out, and it ends/offs itself, prematurely."

","As a fan of the original story, I was glad the movie kept pace with the building tension and eventual climax. Unfortunately, having the survivors of such an ordeal simply run out of gas and decide to give up? Sorry, but even without the parent taking their child's life, it was just too much of a cop out. If they were being attacked as they ran out of gas and the only option left to them was to die by their own hand or that of the creatures, I would have accepted their actions. No, this was just not a worthy ending to such a great tale of survival and overcoming adversity. In order to make a story like this memorable and recommended, you need to make the end something worthwhile, and unfortunately I will always see this as a movie which could have been much better."

"smwance","4","0","3","9 December 2007"," A lot of potential but a bad ending
","I really feel disappointed by this film, especially since I expect great things from Frank Darabont given his previous works, and I'm a big fan of Thomas Jayne as someone who can pull off the identifiable ""everyman"" very well.<br/><br/>As a horror movie, there are some okay thrills and some tension, but the habit was to run back to old school tactics and tricks that weren't nearly as innovative as they could've been and the tension was too often out-maneuvered by the fast pace of the story. The idea of an all-consuming mist just begs for some terrific camera tricks and shots that were never used or conceived. The building up of tension between the trapped people could've been milked a little more with a dash more character development. For example, Mrs. Carmody could have been much more developed and more established interpersonal connections between the characters would've add depth to their struggles with each other. In the end, we're left with some stereotypical and shallow character sketches that we've seen in so many other horror movies.<br/><br/>I also think they could've left much more to the imagination about what was in the mist. While they didn't always show you the ""full monty"" of the monsters, they still showed more than they had to. It would've given so much more if they kept the monsters even more shrouded and played more off people's imaginations, which can be worse than any movie monster thought up in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Finally, one of the driving forces we often look for in a movie is some sense of hope at the end, and while I appreciate the irony and twist of this story's ending, it still leaves a depressing, disturbing end to a story with very little to show for it except to say ""yeah, that's what human beings do."""
"robert-880","8","0","2","5 December 2007"," Great telling of a good King story
","How many times have you said or heard the words ""the book was better!"" Well, Darabont has done something quite exceptional here. He's made a movie that is exactly like the story...in the best possible way.<br/><br/>I've read and enjoyed The Mist several times since its publication. I've always respected King as a spinner of great yarns who gets unfairly stereotyped as a schlock writer. But the main reason King has been so successful over the years is his talent for people. He's great with people. His characters are complex, varied, believable, and most importantly (when he's hitting on all cylinders), they evolve! While The Mist is a more straight-ahead horror story than many of his other gems, it's still more about how people respond in different ways to horrific challenges, than about the challenges themselves. King's a master of irony too. If you have to be stranded somewhere for an extended period, doesn't a supermarket full of food seem like a desirable choice? In his evil scenario, while people elsewhere might be plotting how to reach the food, people in the supermarket are praying for a way out! Beautiful! I'd agree with some of the critics of The Mist that some of the characters could use a bit more subtlety. And FD did add a couple characters and events, and dropped a couple. But for the most part, the movie was pretty much exactly how I pictured the people, places and events when I read it. This is also a testimony to King's skill with artful description.<br/><br/>Plenty has been written about the story itself, so I'll spare you that. And as you probably know by now, everyone's talking about the ending -- that it was a departure from the book and that they love it or hate it. All I'll add here is that, if one reads the story, King actually sets this ending upÂ…he just leaves you with your imagination. Darabont brashly follows through on one possible scenario that actually seems plausible given the circumstances. I salute his courage and recommend this movie."
"somf","9","0","2","3 December 2007"," Parts of the film were a 10 and parts were a 1
","Never quite seen anything like the Mist. First of all, if you see it, and anyone who has any love for good horror films needs to see this, you really must see it on the big screen. Darabont's ""Shawshank Redemption"" bombed at the box office and became a huge success after it was released on DVD. This is a better film in my opinion, but I am not one of Shawshank's biggest fans. However this will not gain the status that Shawshank did post it's theatrical release since the stuff that should play well on the small screen is pretty awful. Let me explain. The special effects, the creatures, the chilling scenes with them. That is the 10 part. There were several scenes that are quite frankly Alien and Carpenter's Thing type classic and you just have to see the film for that. And the message is anti-fear and how the military industrial complex instills this in us and controls us, and it is anti-evangelical for doing the same thing. I am a liberal. I agree whole heartedly with the films message, but it is so ham handed that it really becomes annoying. And Marcia Gay Harden's character could take the prize for the most annoying character ever to grace the silver screen. You don't believe for a moment anything about her character or really anything about any of the stupid symbolic characters that side with her. Bottom line is the stupid people are worse than the dumb teenagers in a slasher flick and about as believable. That being said there is lot of homage to the horror films of the 50's and even a Twilight Zone type twist that makes this a great film. But the bad parts are really really bad. I can only imagine how a politically conservative viewer would really get their bile worked up watching this."

","Although this film has its flaws, the good parts are so good that it still gets eight stars. Until the last two minutes I'd have given it only five or six, but the ending (I'll not breathe a word) is so powerful, so moving, and so human that it got up to eight without breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>The best thing is the performances. Not just the leads- everyone. This is the kind of ensemble work that is usually found only in live theater. One reader compared this to TWELVE ANGRY MEN. Good simile.<br/><br/>The great flaw is that there are moments where these characters do things you just can't believe, and to be generous it runs forty minutes too long. Someone thought it would be a good idea to take 127 minutes to adapt a novella that was only 131 pages. Bad, bad mistake.<br/><br/>For this reason there were too many points where my interest completely drifted. Scenes would end with a fade-out, as if a commercial was going to be inserted at that point. There were two segments that were desperately in need of heavy cutting.<br/><br/>Early in the story David (the main character) and several other characters have seen a store employee killed by a huge beast with many tentacles. Brent, David's next door neighbor, is a lawyer from out of town who owns a vacation home in Castle Rock. Brent refuses to believe their story and thinks that this is all an elaborate practical joke.<br/><br/>OK. Here these people are barricaded in a grocery store. They heard sirens outside, military and emergency vehicles have been rushing by, a bloodied man came in shouting that there's ""something"" in the mist, the building has been shaken as if by a massive earthquake.<br/><br/>And a man spoken of as destined for the Supreme Court thinks that this is a prank? Yep, those folks in Castle Rock sure know how to pull a practical joke.<br/><br/>Then there's Mrs. Carmody, the local fruitcake who's a nut on religion. The third day of the siege she has a scene that seems inspired by the last act of THE CRUCIBLE and generates giggles when the author/director hoped for gasps. There are points where her monologues seemed to be song cues. There are enough monsters outside in the mist. A little bit of psycho woman goes a long way.<br/><br/>Other than that the special effects are awesome, the acting great, there's a powerful and yet subtle musical score, and Darabont should be proud of himself.<br/><br/>Yes, there are differences between the book and the film. Artistic license.<br/><br/>Since the novella was published, America has been through 9/11, Katrina, and war. These things most likely informed Darabont's decision to develop the story the way he did.<br/><br/>By the way, this is a movie movie. See it in a theater the way the good Lord intended on a big screen and an awesome sound system. The use of stereo, especially in the scene in the drugstore, added a lot to the experience."

","The Mist is a fairly straightforward adaptation of the novella, but with an extended ending. I didn't find the movie particularly scary, and through it all (and especially when I first read the story twenty years ago) I kept thinking of another book I read some thirty-five years ago about a fog bank that rolled across the land, a fog of time that brought creatures and people from the past into the present. Alas, when I was teenager I seldom paid attention to the names of books and authors, so I cannot recall either for that tale.<br/><br/>The two characters in the movie I found most interesting were Norton, played by Andre Braugher, and Ollie, played by Toby Jones. There's something intriguing about a lawyer, a man of apparent intelligence, whose mind curls into a fetal position when confronted with unusual events. And Ollie, well, what other talents did the little man possess? My favorite scene is when he loads the gun with expertise, much to his boss's confusion.<br/><br/>I did not like the ending, and I hope there's an alternate or two on the DVD. I thought of three as I was walking out of the theater. The Hitchcock ending, like in the novella, where they drive out of sight into the mist and we don't know what happens to them. The happy ending, where the mist begins to clear, and they meet the soldiers. And my favorite, the ambiguous ending, where they're almost on empty, with just a few more minutes of fuel left, and the camera pulls back to reveal the full extent of the mist cover, and that the soldiers are indeed closing in, but they're still miles away.<br/><br/>I give it four out of ten, and recommend seeing it at least once."

","I had a 5-hour layover in Hartford recently, during which time I purchased Cheddar Chex-Mix, Grape flavored Dasani water, and a paperback of Stephen King's ""The Mist,"" which I enjoyed thoroughly, as I do with most King books. He paces his action well enough that the jolts of excitement and terror come at just the right moments in increasing ferocity until he reaches a mind-blowing climax and a fitting conclusion.<br/><br/>So, naturally I was eager to see Frank Darabont's adaptation, having seen nothing but good things from this talented screenwriter/director. And yet, I come back from the theater disappointed, something I was praying not to be in the times between the action sequences. I did like the movie and audiences will too, but my opinion of it sank like a rock during the last five minutes; the ending was completely botched.<br/><br/>But onto the good: After a storm for the record books, in which trees fell on and through houses, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son take a trip to the supermarket to pick up supplies, bringing his not-so-neighborly neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) along and noting the unusual mist forming over the lake, coming ever closer...<br/><br/>And then, as promised, we get the monsters. They come in droves, of all shapes and sizes, inspired by the creepy-crawlies that haunt children's dreams and their parents' pantries. Though sometimes the CGI seems out of place, most of the time it works quite well, and sometimes what we do not see is much scarier, as the mist only allows about five feet of visibility. It is a most impressive mist, flowing just unnaturally enough to make one uneasy about breathing, touching, or even looking at it.<br/><br/>Even more impressive than that, however, are the performances. All of the characters seem genuine in their motivations as they go from confused to scared, panicked to fanatic. Norton's denial of the entire situation seems a little contrived, but I'll forget that in a heartbeat when I see the religious insanity of Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), which translates so well from the book that what sympathy I felt for David and his posse I felt double in hatred for her.<br/><br/>So, good performances, great story, nice special effects, terrible ending. I would not dream of ruining either this film or the book for anyone, although those who have read the book will find a reference to the ending in the first paragraph of this review, but I will say this: King concludes his novella with a self-described ""Hitchcock Ending,"" one fitting enough to satisfy an audience but still open to interpretation, aka ""The Birds."" Now, however, Darabont feels the need to tie everything together, and with the sacrifice of that conclusion, the movie is left without a point. Looking back, though, the movie works as a whole, but I wish that I had walked out about five minutes earlier."

The music at the end of the movie added to pathos and the otherworldly divine and cosmic retribution atmosphere.<br/><br/>This is a very very powerful movie."

","The Mist/2007/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: David Drayton: Thomas Jane Mrs. Carmody: Marcia Gay Harden Amanda Dumfries: Laurie Holden<br/><br/>This is from the mind of Stephen King, not Frank Darabont. Although Darabont adapted this into his own film, this is based on a novella by Stephen King. So, if you think this film is a typical stupid horror film seen dozens of times a year, think again. The true horror is not in the monster, the bug, or the animal; it is in the people. Yes It is true this film has monsters with tentacles, weird looking heads, strange eyes, a bunch of legs, deformed bodies basically gross-out pieces of crap. That is typical in every stupid gimmicky cheap horror flick. This has all those things plus grotesque scenes with the people. But it also has something deeper. The people themselves: what they think and how they act.<br/><br/>It took me a while to whip up a star rating, but I finally gave it three stars for not only its effort in directing, performances, etc. but the chilling truth of it all. Not the bugs. But the people and how circumstances like these are taken. This is a truly chilling film in ways.<br/><br/>Just what is the premise? Actually, it is very simple. A strange collaboration of mist reverberates throughout a town. Within the mist are creatures. That could have been worded better but oh well. These creatures in the mist basically have no purpose of even living. Practically all they do is kill what they HEAR. If they hear the humans they kill. Easy, right? So how is it possible to make a feature-length film with that lame premise? Well, concentrating on the characters<br/><br/>The main character David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the one this movie circles around. Drayton is an artist. He creates movie posters for a studio, is a married man and has a kid. Unfortunately, the mist comes after a violent storm, and after a while he, his kid, and all the other characters we will soon know are trapped in a convenience store. We soon get used to the store as being the home for the characters. So that's settled. However, this convenience store isn't as convenient as it seems. Unfortunate events happen, people get killed. It's realistic but it's also not. It's confusing sometimes when you think about it. Stephen King messes with your mind. Even though he had nothing to do with the production of this film besides being the guy that Darabont snatched the idea from, I just can't help but feel that he is all over this. It's disturbing in a way and so is the film. So deep but yet not hard to comprehend, probably not hard to create either. Although he messes with your mind and emotions or tries to anyway, his stories aren't extremely complicated. They are actually kind of juvenile. But it's what he puts inside that is truly deep.<br/><br/>The character we seem to hate as soon as we see is the crazy bible thumper Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden). She is insane, truly. She continues throughout the film to smash the bible and its words in the peoples' faces. It causes people to get stressed out. She thinks this is all how God wanted it to happen. She is bible crazy, overly dramatic about every event and expects it to happen the way the bible words it in Revelations. Harden is brilliant here as Carmody. She played her part so well I actually thought she was really insane. Very convincing. Or if someone just walked on the set he or she would probably think she was truly out of her mind. Actually, all the parts were played very well. Not one bad actor/actress present. Even Drayton's kid played his part to perfection.<br/><br/>Someone we begin to like is Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), who begins to develop a friendship with David and take care of his kid. The actress is great and played her role so well. The entire film is convincing, wonderfully acted, well done!<br/><br/>But I can't give it any more than three stars. Something tells me we have all seen this before. It reminds me a lot of John Carpenter's The Fog but that was a two star at most film. This is better but still not excellent. Something continues to tell me that this has been brought about before, the beginning, the middle and even the ending, which was very good by the way. Some people disagree and thought it was too much to handle. Come on people, it's a film.<br/><br/>Perhaps this has been made before. Not just The Fog, or this storyline or even the people. Maybe the whole thing has been talked about before. Maybe it truly has been written (implied) in the pages of the bible and preached by bible enthusiasts throughout the world.<br/><br/>Movie directed by Frank Darabont."

","The Mist is based upon the novella of the same name by Stephen King. The film takes place after a big storm where some of the townspeople gather in a grocery store and soon find out that outside of the store there are bloodthirsty creatures lurking around, so for safety they decide to stay protected in the store and barricade themselves in. However things take a turn for the worst when the store can not hold back all of the creatures and the people in the store soon realize that along with the creatures their own worst enemies are each other as well. Basically, The Mist reminded me of a type of film that would be released in the summer months because it is what I would call a popcorn film because of the action, entertainment and fun of it. The film also reminded me of a bad movie in the sense of some of it is very over the top, laughable at times, but despite this also very captivating and a joy to watch for a two hour entertaining diversion. I don't often say this, but the things that made The Mist so over the top including some of the acting and plot twists were also some of the things that added to the film's campy charm. And I never felt it was so ludicrous that it was embarrassing for the cast or the filmmakers. On the other hand there are a few strong performances in the film and the story is very intriguing and full of action and enough to keep you involved for the two hour running time and some of the effects aren't that bad either. There were also a few darker and more powerful moments injected into the film and instead of feeling awkward or out of place in an otherwise very campy film, I felt they worked and even strengthened the film in parts. What I also enjoyed was the film's character study which introduced us to many different characters and as the film goes along it also shows us their true human nature and will to survive and sometimes ending up doing terrible things to others to achieve their own survival. Basically other than a few main characters the others were mostly out for each other and the film captured realistically what it most likely would have been like in a chaotic situation like this no matter how far fetched the actual story is. I realize that I gave this film a very high rating, but it entertained me and kept my interest and because of some strong touches to the story as well as some well written characters and the fact that this is just one big popcorn film that would have been a big grosser had it been released in the summer months, so for all these reasons and if you are a fan of Stephen King or campy B movies that are a lot of fun then you probably will find something to like in this film as well."
"filmkind","5","0","6","24 November 2007"," The Importance of balance
","This movie is quite something in it's appeal, and what with the marketed method(to those who are either King fans or who have knowledge of the previous King/Darabont colaboration, the most challenging thing actually to not mistake it for just another horror picture. (though I think the November release is a nice help)<br/><br/>Though it is interesting, witnessing how films portray themselves to an audience through every element from directors style to final sounds. Concerning the elements,: Directors devise in the environment/canvass that they're given. His previous films have all been period pieces (early 1900's). I think about how directors apply more seemingly when given a richer canvass(historical period,exotic location etc.). When given a modern setting (I think about Spielberg with 'The Terminal'), it seems something is lost in this environment of just conteporary familiar life. -From a technical standpoint I understand how complex it must be shooting in certain given environments (grocery store for 80% of the movie). -It seems that his cinematographer is clearly from television drama/action and very apparent with the various zoom jerks and hand-held rigid shots. something that Frank has never used. -'Never just show the monster' so to speak is an old adage worth respect, though not apparent is this work. It comes also to mind the effects that frank had not been accustomed to were probably a reason for this, as I've seen directors with even small effects shots for the first time in their films try to understand the logistics of it and therefore possibly loosing some of the native vision in the process. I wonder by the violent confliction in this movie if Frank in some way is relaying out his own inner strife over the loss with his Indy Jones 4 issue. I don't know; could be something there.<br/><br/>Music in this film was very minimal. Although personally I align with the postponement of score through the opening current of the film, the music seemed not quite making it off the ground throughout the rest of the film.<br/><br/><ul><li>I've learned, that no matter what difinitivenss initially you may feel; It's almost always beneficial to let a fim rest and then revisit it again after some time.

"iliveforhim1976","7","0","4","24 November 2007"," MOVIE REVIEW: Stephen King's The Mist
","I personally don't like the IMDb summary. It doesn't really speak about the movie that I just saw nor the story I have read and like a lot. So let me try to work up a summary that is worthy.<br/><br/>My Summary: A day after a huge thunderstorm that puts a tree through the window of their lake house and topples the Draytons boathouse, a mysterious mist rolls in off of the lake. David Drayton and his son accompany their neighbor Mr. Norton into town to the local grocery store to get some supplies. They quickly find out that the mist is more than just fog. Becoming trapped inside the store along with many other town members and out of towners, they engage in a battle that will test their ability to reason, sanity, and faith as they come face to face with what evil really is.<br/><br/>A string of many familiar faces, including Thomas Jane (The Punisher) as David Drayton, are among the amazing cast assembled for this film . The story is one about the nature of fear and what will happen when you take people out of their normal surroundings and pack them together in an intense, stressful, and terrifying situation.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont, who directed The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, takes a different approach to this film. Instead of playing it safe with crane shots, steady cam work, and sweeping music like the previous two films, he instead decides to use a much more rough style involving hand held shots, old school special effects, and virtually no music. This in turn gives the viewer a much different experience. You feel as though you are trapped in the store with the players and that you can't escape either. When things start happening to the people, you feel for them, you can understand their pain because you are going through it also.<br/><br/>I also must give Darabont credit for writing an ending to the story that originally didn't have an ending. It is a very good ending and one that Stephen King approves of. I do feel there were some things lacking from the film and I thought that it could have been better. However, I did enjoy it."
"TOMNEL","6","0","7","23 November 2007"," Did not live up to my expectations, but still a good enough movie.
","I guess I expected perfection from the guy who brought us ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"", and this movie was by no means perfect. However, it was a very entertaining horror movie with good characters, and even a few scares.<br/><br/>After several strange accidents, a mist begins coming in from the mountains. All the residents of the town go to the local grocery store to get their supplies as the mist, and military roll through this little town. The mist eventually gets to this grocery store, and after a death, people realize that this mist has creatures in it. A large, eclectic group of people waits in the store while the mist waits for them. It sounds pretty stupid but it's actually very good. The direction was fantastic, and even though this wasn't mile a minute scares, it was still very tense throughout, while still managing to have a great sense of humor. The characters were exactly what you'd expect from a Frank Darabount adaptation of Stephen King's work; there was a wide range of characters, each (of the main) well developed and with their own unique personality. My huge gripe with the film in the end, was the end, which I did not like (and won't give away). But overall, the idea of making an entire horror movie in one place was scary enough and gave the audience an intimate feel with the settings, and this was a success, but not a huge standout film.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 122 mins. R for violence and language."
"saintpatrick27","8","0","6","23 November 2007"," Reader's Heart/Viewers Mind
","As a total Stephen King zealot, I agree with most of these comments regarding ""the end"". <br/><br/>But here's the thing...you have to look at it from the producer's perspective. They can't make a movie for the readers, we're such a small minority of movie-goers in general! And you can't tell me that if you hadn't read the story, then saw the movie and it ended the way the story does, you can't tell me you wouldn't have been disappointed! You would have been like, ""WTF??? What happened???"" Conversely, the King purest is obviously going to be disappointed, as I've been with every adaptation since ""Mile"" (And I'm still on the fence with ""Storm of The Century""), including this one.<br/><br/>But at least this one was good until the last five minutes, really good. Believable characters, genuinely frightening monsters, fascinating psychological relationships...it had me.<br/><br/>And it lost me. But I think those who haven't read the story would enjoy being frightened for a change, and would probably like the ending, too."
"Mr Parker","9","0","7","23 November 2007"," Someone give Frank Darabont exclusive license, please
","Frank Darabont aims for the nosebleed seats and achieves it with resounding success. He has managed to take a Stephen King story that could have easily been nothing but a B-movie schlock film and translated it into a rich, engrossing film that is right up there with the best of the King adaptations.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was superb on all counts. I've always liked Thomas Jane and I think he makes a great leading man. You'll see a couple of Darabont regulars here like Bill Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn and they deliver as usual. Toby Jones isn't the Ollie Weeks that I pictured from the story but he's one of the best things about the film. Laurie Holden is great also and Frances Sternhagen excels in a role that seems tailor made for her. Marcia Gay Harden's turn as Mrs. Carmody is the kind of performance that is of Oscar quality. Most likely it won't happen but I'd love to see an acting nomination spring up come Oscar time.<br/><br/>The special effects aren't so great but they're not so bad either. The movie is pretty gruesome at times and several people get shredded to bits quite nicely.<br/><br/>What I love most about this film is that Darabont pretty much does the same thing he did with Shawshank: he takes the original source and expands upon it without ruining the integrity of the original story. There are small additions here and there with the ending fleshed out into a logical and more definitive denouement. None of what is added ruins the story in anyway, it enhances it. The man is an actor's director and again, I have to praise the acting in this film for keeping me rooted in the sense of dread and despair that weighs down on you from the very beginning and is so essential to the story.<br/><br/>Go see this movie but be warned for it's a rough ride. It's really tense for pretty much the entire runtime and it's a very dark film.<br/><br/>RATING: ****1/2 out of *****."
"Billy82","8","0","5","22 November 2007"," stayed true to the story, intense, gory, creepy, apocalyptic, yet i loved every minute of it. (spoilers)
","I'll admit that i had been waiting almost 10 since reading this story for it to become a film. the story itself had so many film like elements that made the reader feel like he/she was actually watching a movie rather than reading a story.<br/><br/>I'm not giving this a high rating just because i liked the story, but because it was an accurate portrayal of the story, its intensity, and lots of innovations to give it a nasty atmosphere.<br/><br/>first the negatives, which there aren't too many. at times the acting tended to be on the bland side but then picked back up as the scene went along or got more intense. if you look closely when the camera is on the mist from inside to the upper screen you can see the spotlights showing from a ceiling, but i guess they were covering that as a sodium street light, i dunno. i was expecting to see more of the monster that grabbed Ollie as that was a climax, but i guess its more scarier not to see all of it. the ending definitely isn't everyones ending, but an ending nonetheless that should be expected in any horror film because horror films aren't supposed to have good endings. however i would've preferred if they used the original ending from the story and let the audience use their own imagination as to what happened to them.<br/><br/>now for the positives. despite the bland moments i mentioned above, Jane, Holden, Jones, Nathan and Hardin handle their roles very well. Hardin is so unlikeable that i have to say she did a damn good job of playing off her intentions. 2 scenes that grabbed me was w/ Jane and his son begging him not to go to the pharmacy, and Hardin about to sacrifice Nathan/Holden (the audience clapped at the end of this scene.) i was actually surprised that among the intense moments you could find comedic moments in between that the audience seemed to identify with. Frank really does a great job of bringing lots of realism to the film and gives it a realistic feel. sorta like how Spielberg did movies like jaws or close encounters, he has the whole ensemble cast participate very well as one. i also like how he uses the fade out to black tactic used in Carpenter's THE THING. so even though this film is set in present time, that fade out effect gave it a very 80s horror film feel which i felt worked very well for this film. the fact that there's not too much music is also interesting. but the end score is so depressing/apocalyptic that no other score could've fit better. the creature's while they're not the main focus to the actual theme of the story, were made so ""out of this world"", undefined, unexpected, yet very close to how i expected them to turn out from reading the story/hearing the audio book. the creature at the end, i will admit was by far the weirdest yet creepiest monster I've ever seen on film. the theme of humans being the real monsters rather than the monsters outside is what makes this film a classic. and if the general public cant see that and expect a monster film w/ a decent ending, then all i can say is they're loss. the underlying messages brought across by Hardin's character about the decay of our society, the misinterpretations of religion, and the evils of our consumer society really says a lot about how we would act if this actually happened to us. Jones defines that perfectly in one of his lines.<br/><br/>this film was worth the wait, a solid 4/5 star film in my book. and while everyones not going to like this, (esp the ending) the only way you can enjoy this film is to see it for what its trying to tell us on how humans react to fear. like it or hate it, Stephen Kings the mist has finally descended."
